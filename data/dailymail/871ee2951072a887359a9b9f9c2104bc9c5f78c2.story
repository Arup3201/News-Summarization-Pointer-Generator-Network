Jobless people attending courses run by David Cameron's 'back to work' tsar  Emma Harrison were ordered to sign blank timesheets, it was alleged yesterday.

Others complained of being forced to waste hours sitting doing nothing instead  of being allowed to look for gainful employment.

A damning dossier of allegations about Mrs Harrison's employment agency A4e has been handed to the Comptroller and Auditor General by former minister Fiona  Mactaggart.

She is the Labour MP for Slough, Berkshire, where last week A4e's offices were  visited by police as part of a fraud probe.

The Prime Minister is facing demands to suspend lucrative Whitehall contracts  which A4e won to help the long-term unemployed find jobs.

'Posh commune': A4e boss Mrs Harrison's £5million pile has 16 bedrooms, 100 acres of land, a pool, spa, a bar, a nightclub and a long dining table for banquets

Millionairess Mrs Harrison, 48 - made
 families tsar by Mr Cameron after she  boasted she could help problem 
families find work - triggered outrage when she  paid herself 
£8.6million of mainly taxpayers' cash.

Ministers
 have sought urgent reassurance there is no 'systematic fraud' of the  
public purse, after Thames Valley Police were called in by the 
Department of  Work and Pensions.

Ms
 Mactaggart's dossier contains accusations from constituents who were 
made to  attend an A4e 'back to work' course as a condition of receiving
 state benefits.

One claimed: 'Every Friday, the "clients" have to sign a blank timesheet and  the times are filled in later.

'Members of my group were told to fill in a blank piece of paper outlining any  "modules"...and to sign a blank "review".

'I would guess this was to fraudulently claim that all "criteria" as laid down  by the government was adhered to.'

Another
 complainant, a construction worker, said he had spent 13 weeks on an  
A4e course supposedly to renew a forklift operator's licence yet had 
'received  no training at all', despite repeatedly asking for some.

Attendance
 on a back-to-work course is mandatory for the long-term unemployed  if 
they want to keep being paid benefits, and companies such as A4e charge 
 taxpayers millions of pounds to run them.

But a third person described a 'chaotic, unorganised' A4e course in which 'we  would mostly be shunted in and out of rooms, staring at walls, long silences  with none of the staff telling the group what was happening'.

She told the MP her group was forced to 'learn' menial tasks such as how to  write a letter on a computer. She said: 'I did not learn anything that I did  not know already, and it is ridiculous and worrying that people like myself  should be forced into this position where I have a proven work history.'

Last night Ms Mactaggart, a former Home Office minister and a member of the  influential Public Accounts Committee, said: 'I think there is a series of what  appears to me on the face of it to be fraudulent actions - expecting people to  sign blank time sheets and so on.

'It is in itself wrong to get vulnerable unemployed people to sign blank time  sheets, because this company is in the position where it has the power to put  people in breach of their Jobseekers' Allowance conditions.

'In my view, that makes A4e not fit to receive a government contract. The  government should absolutely consider suspending the contracts.

'The concerns that my constituents have raised are sufficient for me to believe  that they are not a proper company to get taxpayers' money and to be dealing  with vulnerable people.'

The MP forwarded the complaints to Sir Amyas Morse, the Comptroller and Auditor  General - the head of the National Audit Office which scrutinises the accounts  of government departments and agencies.

She demanded an investigation, telling him the cases seemed to be examples of  'A4e taking money from the Government without actually delivering anything  worthwhile'.

Other MPs have attacked Mrs Harrison's vast dividend, which she paid herself  after A4e recorded a £234million turnover. A4e - which used to be called Action  For Employment - makes all its UK income from state contracts.

Mrs Harrison, worth an estimated £70million, lives in a £7million country  mansion in Derbyshire with her husband Jim, their four children, and a group of  11 close friends and their six children in a 'posh commune'.

Labour's Margaret Hodge, who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, has led calls for Mrs Harrison's company to have its state contracts suspended

Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, yesterday  tabled a parliamentary question asking whether the Government would suspend the  company's contracts pending inquiries.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'Officers visited the offices of A4e in  Slough as part of an allegation of fraud, which was referred to the Force by  the Department for Work and Pensions. The investigation is ongoing and at an  early stage, therefore we are currently unable to comment any further.'

A4e said the police had only come in 'for a meeting' and had not taken away any  documents.

It said the fraud probe concerned an isolated incident two years ago  relating to four employees who had since left the company, and that A4e had discovered the alleged fraud itself and reported it to the Department for Work  and Pensions within 48 hours.

Last night an A4e spokesman insisted the concerns raised by Ms Mactaggart had  been resolved, saying: 'Under the new Work Programme, customers are no longer  required to fill out timesheets.

'All our staff have clear guidelines on how to complete claims made under Work  Programme and these claims are independently verified by the employer and by  JobCentre Plus.

'A4e has a zero tolerance policy towards any form of behaviour that might lead  to allegations of fraud.

'The concerns raised by Fiona Mactaggart's constituents are not linked to the  current Thames Valley Police investigation.'
