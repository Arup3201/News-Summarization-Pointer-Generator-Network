An elderly woman escaped injury after she accidentally reversed through the front window of a busy supermarket.

The woman ploughed through the front of the Waitrose supermarket in York shortly before 5pm yesterday.

The red Ford Fiesta mounted the curb and smashed through two plate glass windows before coming to a rest in the store's lobby.

Shoppers and staff at the Waitrose store in York fled in terror as the Ford Fiesta, pictured, ploughed through the front window of the supermarket

The elderly female motorist misjudged her speed while manoeuvring in the supermarket car park, stamping on the car's throttle instead of the brake

Staff and customers were forced to flee as shattered glass was thrown into to the store towards the tills.

One member of staff is understood to have suffered some minor cuts and bruises.

North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue attended the scene and assisted the elderly lady who escaped without injury.

One eyewitness who had just completed her weekly shop and was waiting for a cup of coffee said she spotted the car as it careered through the window with an almighty bang.

'Then an absolutely excellent young man - a customer - took control of the situation. I don't know who he was but he was reassuring the driver and keeping her calm.'Â 

One female member of staff suffered minor cuts and bruises as a result of the incident.

A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue confirmed they had been called out to the incident at 16.41 on Saturday.

'Fire appliances from York and Acomb 
and a heavy rescue unit from Tadcaster have dealt with a single vehicle 
traffic collision at Waitrose in York.

'It
 would appear that a Ford Fiesta was accidentally driven through the 
shop frontage and came to rest inside the store with various fittings 
and debris around it.

'The 
elderly female driver was assisted from the vehicle by fire crews and 
received a check up by paramedics on the scene but appeared uninjured.

'A
 female member of staff in the store received minor cuts and bruises and
 suffered shock. Fire crews assisted in making the scene safe and left it in the hands of Police.'

A Waitrose spokesman said: 'Thankfully nobody was seriously injured and we're very grateful to the emergency services for their prompt and expert response.'

North Yorkshire police attended the scene and are investigating the cause of the accident.
