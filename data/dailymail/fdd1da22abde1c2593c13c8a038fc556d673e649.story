Dave Whelan blundered into a race storm after appointing Malky Mackay this week but there may be a power-shift already under way behind the scenes at Wigan Athletic. 

Whelan has long cherished a vision for his grandson to take over at the helm and 23-year-old David Sharpe is increasingly influential at the club this season. 

This week’s events — when sponsors pulled out because of Mackay and controversial remarks made by Whelan — could accelerate his exit strategy, particularly if the FA ban him.

Behind the scenes, though, there may already be a power shift as Whelan's (right) grandson may take over

Sharpe has no official title at the club but has become a familiar presence, working across different departments to get a closer feel for the place. 

Whelan has spoken openly about his desire to keep the club in the family when he steps aside and has resisted selling out abroad. 

‘The time comes for everyone when you need to retire or take a step back because you’re simply not what you used to be,’ said Whelan, in an interview with FC Business, three years ago.

Whelan is keen on keeping the club in his family when he steps aside, and his grandson is now influential

‘I’d like to create a dynasty here. My grandson is a bright boy, and massively keen on football and Wigan Athletic. I’m inclined to let him have a go and I hope that it happens.’ 

Wigan say there are no imminent plans for Whelan to step down, but Sharpe’s involvement has increased since Sharpy’s, the fish and chip restaurant he managed near the DW Stadium, closed earlier this year. He has also been active in the selection and appointment of managers.
