A TV ad screening in China, aimed at reminding people to be better behaved during their overseas trips, portrays tourists as pandas who publicly urinate, litter, intrude on photos and graffiti on trees.

Set in Sydney, 'The Civilised Panda Travel Services' was created by advertising agency DDB China Group and was commissioned by Chinese state television broadcaster CCTV as a 'public service announcement'.

In the bizarre video, pandas are seen engaging in rude and lewd behaviour while touring the sights the iconic Sydney Harbour has to offer.

In the video, a panda is seen sleeping and taking up an entire public park bench

An elderly woman comes along and wakes it up, and asks it to move over so she can sit down

The first scenario involves a panda snoozing and taking up an entire park bench before an elderly woman wakes it up.

She gestures for him to move over and the panda complies.

A second panda is then seen walking through a park while sipping on a bottle of water as a gardener is working.

The finishes the bottle and disposes of it by throwing it over his shoulder, hitting the man tending to flowers who shakes his head when he realises what has happened.

A panda is also seen urinating in public on a wall at iconic Sydney Harbour

Another panda is seen intruding on a photo two other tourists are taking in front of the Sydney Opera House

DDB Group Asia Pacific Chief Communications Officer Karen See told Daily Mail Australia said this version of the advertisement was a 'director's cut'

This version did not air, instead one without a panda urinating was used but only on Chinese television

Other various scenarios seen throughout the announcement, including a panda taking to a tree with spray paint, urinating in public, taking up entire footpaths and intruding on other people's photos in front of the Sydney Opera House.

The advertisement ends with 'Be a good panda, be a good tourist'.

It has since been pulled from CCTV but a reason was not given as to why the decision was made, Mumbrella reported.

DDB Group Asia Pacific Chief Communications Officer Karen See told Daily Mail Australia said this version of the advertisement was a 'director's cut' and did not air on television.

Instead a version which omitted a panda urinating in public was aired on Chinese television only, Ms See said.

'It was a public service announcement reminding the people of China to be aware of their actions when traveling overseas,' she said.
