The millionaire fraudster who gave the Liberal Democrats £2.4million in stolen money has given the party fresh cause for embarrassment by naming his dog Charlie - after former party leader Charles Kenendy.

Michael Brown, 45, has spent three years on the run after handing over the cash to the Lib Dem leader before being convicted of theft in his absence.

The fugitive donor has named his rottweiler-alsatian cross Charlie, a business associate claimed to the Guardian newspaper.

'He told me that he had given money to a political party and that his puppy was named after the leader. He thought it was funny,' the friend claimed to the newspaper.

Brown, who was convicted of stealing £36million from his clients in his absence in November 2008, has a Caribbean hideout in the Dominican Republic which has no extradition treaty with Britain.

He and his dog have been seen in a gold Porsche Cayenne 4X4 as he spends his time at exclusive hang outs on the island.

He skipped bail and disappeared in 2008 and now faces a seven-year jail sentence.

Police, who confirmed he fled to the luxurious island, said they had been working urgently
behind the scenes for more than a year to bring him to justice. 

But so far Brown has managed to evade police and the courts for his crimes.

He duped British authorities into giving
him a British passport, even though at the time he was on bail for a 
£60million fraud case and images of him had appeared in newspapers 
because of his huge donation.

He had already been convicted of in 2006 for obtaining a passport by deception, the Guardian reported.

It was this false passport that 
allowed him to acquire fake Dominican documents, and he has applied for 
temporary residency and put his name on the electoral register.

Senior Lib Dem figures admitted they had spent all the money the fraudster handed them.

Former leader Charles Kennedy said the donation – the biggest in the party’s history – had ‘long since been spent’.

He insisted the Lib Dems went the ‘extra mile’ to check out Brown before accepting the stolen cash ahead of the 2005 election.

Brown has been living a low-key life 
of luxury on the island, renting expensive properties and playing golf 
on exclusive courses.

A photo from a golf club membership card revealed 
he has lost weight, grown a beard and allowed his blond-dyed hair to 
turn grey.

It emerged two men suspected of helping him flee Britain and adopt a new identity were arrested and questioned last Friday.

Senior officers are furious that the 
details have emerged because negotiations to secure Brown’s extradition 
were at a sensitive stage.

No Briton has ever been forced to return from
the Dominican Republic but prosecutors remain hopeful they can secure a
ground-breaking deal.

Mugshot: Michael Brown is trapped in the Dominican Republic

Last night, Brown had fled his luxury home but remained effectively trapped in the island country which neighbours Haiti.

Detective Superintendent Bob Wishart,
of City of London Police, said: ‘We remain determined to ensure Michael
Brown is returned to the UK to face justice and serve his sentence – 
his victims and UK law demand no less.’

Brown had been due to stand trial in 
2008 charged with 18 offences, including money laundering, theft and 
perverting the course of justice.

He posed as an international bond 
dealer, pretended his father was a Lord, claimed connections with 
royalty, and promised investors returns of up to 50 per cent. Among his 
international array of victims was former Manchester United chairman 
Martin Edwards, who handed over £8million.

Brown mixed freely with senior Lib 
Dem figures, and channelled his substantial cash gift to them through a 
company called 5th Avenue Partners.

The Electoral Commission investigated the affair but ruled the party did not have to hand back the money.

The whereabouts of his wife of 15 years, Sharon, remains a mystery.
