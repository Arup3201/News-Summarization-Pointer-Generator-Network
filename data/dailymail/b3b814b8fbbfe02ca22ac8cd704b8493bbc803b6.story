The Coalition has squandered £800million on consultants and temps to do the work vacated by tens of thousands of civil servants who received almost £300million in redundancy payoffs.

An investigation into the Whitehall ‘revolving door’ scandal has found that departments have been laying off workers but taking on expensive consultants - some earning more than £1,000 a day - to do the same jobs.

In 2012/13, the cost of pay-offs to redundant civil servants totalled £287million - with the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Work and Pensions topping the league table of payments.

More than 140 civil servants at the MoJ received pay-offs exceeding £100,000 - including four who got between £250,0000 and £350,000.

This total spent on pay-offs was however dwarfed by the £506million spent on consultants helping with projects such as the HS2 rail link, Universal Credit and the West Coast Main Line.

Departments spent a further £328million on ‘off-payroll’ staff, including the employment of short-term or ‘interim’ managers.

The huge spend has occurred despite the fact that Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, announced curbs on the use of management consultants three years ago - saying they were ‘both wasteful and demoralising for mainstream civil servants who feel marginalised’.

Yet the investigation by The Times found that firms such as KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and Ernst & Young are now being wooed back into government to complete difficult projects before the election, and to cover specialist areas such as IT, finance and accountancy.

An insider said: ‘They are determined to
get everything done by 2015 and where anything is going wrong they are 
bringing in consultants. It appears that Francis Maude’s ban has been 
lifted.’

Bernard Jenkin, 
chairman of the Commons public administration committee, criticised the 
revolving door, saying: ‘We have let good people go as part of the 
downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants?’

Some 70,000 civil servants have lost their jobs over the last three years.

Figures show that the Ministry of Justice recorded a high of £89million in exit payments for staff in 2012/13, followed by the Department of Work and Pensions’ £67million.

The highest payment was £623,555 to an unnamed official at the Crown Prosecution Service, and a mandarin at the Department for Education got £450,000.

Moira Wallace, former permanent 
secretary at the Department for Energy and Climate Change, received the 
highest severance payment - £470,000.

She left following a reportedly strained relationship with Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ‘We’ve already put an end to excessive consultancy spend by establishing stringent controls across Government saving, over £1.6billion in 2012-13 compared to the level of spending in 2009-10.

‘The Cabinet Office delivers projects across a wide range of high-profile policy areas. It is sometimes necessary to recruit for specialist business-critical roles.

‘Such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within civil service and where using temporary labour is better value for taxpayers’ money than hiring full-time staff.

‘Bringing in procurement, finance and digital expertise plays a crucial part in our determination to strengthen the corporate centre in Whitehall and ensuring that government operates like the best-run businesses.’
