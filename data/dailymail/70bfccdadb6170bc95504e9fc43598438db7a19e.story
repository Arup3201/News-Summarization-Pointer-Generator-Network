Nurses in a maternity ward aggressively overreacted to a simple request from Douglas Kennedy, then tried to cover up their actions in hopes of ‘lining their pockets’ with Kennedy money, a defense lawyer said Friday.

But a prosecutor said the son of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy needlessly ‘resorted to violence’ when the nurses wouldn't let him take his newborn son out for a walk.

Kennedy is charged with child endangerment and physical harassment in the January 7 incident at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. He is accused of kicking one nurse and twisting the arm of another as he tried to get out with two-day-old Anthony Boru Kennedy.

The trial ended Friday with closing 
arguments. Mount Kisco Town Judge John Donohue, who heard the case 
without a jury, did not say when he would rule, but promised to deliver a
verdict in a ‘reasonable’ amount of time.

Kennedy, who was expected to testify,
chose not to take the stand during the trial which his attorney 
labelled an ‘ordeal’ for the family.

According to Kennedy, he just wanted 
to get his son some fresh air. The nurses claim he was violating 
hospital policies. The confrontation resulted in a series of alarms at 
the hospital, including a hospital-wide ‘code pink,’ which is used to 
signal a baby's abduction.

Defense attorney Robert Gottlieb 
called the code pink ‘preposterous’ and pointed out that a hospital 
guide says the purpose of the alarm is to reunite a baby with its 
family.

The nurses had claimed they classified the situation as a code pink because Kennedy had been ‘violently’ shaking the child.

Gottlieb said nurse Anna Lane told Kennedy 
she would not let him take the baby off the maternity floor, then chased
him as he headed for the exit, disabled an elevator and tried to block 
the door to a stairwell.

Lane said Kennedy twisted her arm in a struggle at the door. Gottlieb denied there was any injury.
Nurse Cari Luciano, who is seen on surveillance video falling onto the 
floor near the stairway, said that happened when Kennedy kicked her as 
she reached for the baby in Kennedy's arms.

But Gottlieb said it was a push rather than a kick and was an instinctive reaction of a father trying to protect his baby.

Kennedy also fell when that happened, but kept hold of the baby. Prosecutors said his actions endangered the boy.

‘The fact that the baby was not injured is a miracle,’ said Assistant District Attorney Amy Puerto.
Gottlieb alleged that when the nurses realized the hospital would 
investigate the incident, they ‘join together, get their stories 
straight and pressure the district attorney's office to bring charges.’

He said they'd been told that any potential lawsuit would have a better chance if a criminal conviction came first.

‘It's an embarrassment that two nurses would so blatantly lie,’ Gottlieb said.

However, Puerto said that argument was ‘a classic case of blaming the victims.’

‘The nurses are not on trial,’ she said.

She said Kennedy ‘resorted to violence instead of simply complying with a request.’

‘He would not be denied despite the safety and best interests of his child,’ she said.

Kennedy's wife, Molly, and other relatives have been accompanying Kennedy to the trial.

A state investigation launched after 
Kennedy's arrest in February, including a visit to the Kennedy home in 
Chappaqua, found no evidence of child abuse.

Kennedy, 45, is the 10th of 11 
children of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. His father was assassinated in 
1968. President John F. Kennedy, his uncle, was assassinated in 1963.

Kennedy was cleared of the child abuse charges in April - but still faces assault charges for his altercation with the nurses.

At the time, Kennedy gave his father’s assassination as the reason why he snatched his baby from the maternity ward.

Douglas
Kennedy, 44, said that being haunted by the death of his father meant 
he could not stop himself from grabbing his newborn son in breach of 
hospital rules.

When staff tried to stop him he said he was merely protecting the infant from 'strangers.’

It has been a difficult year for the 
Kennedys in New York's suburbs. Douglas Kennedy's sister-in-law, Mary 
Kennedy, hanged herself in May in Bedford. His sister, Kerry Kennedy, 
has pleaded not guilty to drug-impaired driving after an accident on 
Interstate 684.
