McLaren racing director Eric Boullier is to sit down with CEO Ron Dennis this week for a final round of talks in a bid to resolve the team's driver line-up for 2015.

Discussions have been ongoing between the duo for some time as they mull over who should partner the returning Fernando Alonso, who is due to be confirmed by McLaren by the end of next week.

After negotiating his severance payment with Ferrari, as Alonso had two years remaining on his agreement with the team, the Spaniard is to join McLaren on a two-year deal, with the option of a third.

As to his team-mate, paddock sources have suggested Boullier and Dennis have a difference of opinion, with the Frenchman favouring Jenson Button, whilst the latter prefers Kevin Magnussen.

With Dennis promising in early September to deliver an answer by the end of the campaign in Abu Dhabi, the clock is ticking, although he ultimately has the final call.

If Dennis needed any convincing Button's experience was the way to go then his performance over the weekend in Brazil will have helped.

In qualifying fifth and finishing fourth at Interlagos, the 34-year-old has now scored nearly double the number of Magnussen's points - 106 to 55.

Boullier refused to be drawn on whether anything could be read into the result, other than to state it was 'a great weekend for the team'.

Boullier added: 'Prior to Sochi (Russian Grand Prix) we were a little bit down.

'But in two of the last three races now we have clearly shown we are capable of putting cars in the top five - Austin (United States Grand Prix) was a little more difficult.

'But the performance levels are rising, we're closing the gap, and for me it is important to seize this momentum at the end of the season.

'It means everything we have done through the season is now starting to pay off, and we are building for the future, so it's good.

'But this weekend specifically, and this race specifically, Jenson did really great.'

Following the anomaly of their result in Australia, with Magnussen second and Button third after Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified, the campaign has been one of struggle up until late.

Boullier is convinced the team now have a platform on which to build for next year when Honda return to the sport as their power-unit supplier.

'Chassis-wise I'm very happy,' added Boullier.

'Every development we have done since the summer is applicable on next year's car, so it's a whole concept I have pushed very hard for to ensure it went through.

'So we have improved the car this year, which is very good, and everything we have learned will benefit next year's car, which is also very good.'

The great unknown, however, is how Honda will perform, particularly as they are a year behind rivals Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault with regard to the development of the power unit.

'I'm sure they're going to be good,' insisted Boullier.

'It will be a very steep learning curve for them on driveability, on just working together.

'After 20 years with Mercedes we've had a strong relationship, but this is a new partner, new people, and also a different culture.

'So everything will be new, which means it will take time to fit and match together, but we know it's going to be good.

'For now, as we say, don't over-promise, over deliver.'
