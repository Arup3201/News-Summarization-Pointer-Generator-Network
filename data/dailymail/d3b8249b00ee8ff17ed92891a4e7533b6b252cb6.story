With two Grammy nods and a nomination for an Academy Award, it's no surprise that singer John Legend has been chosen to grace the cover of Los Angeles Confidential's latest issue.

To celebrate his magazine cover, the title is hosting a big bash on Thursday at the Beverly Hills Hotel - yet, Legend has opted to decline the invitation.

His decision to boycott is in response to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, owner of the hotel chain, and Brunei's Sharia law that allows for the stoning, amputation or flogging of those found guilty of adultery or homosexuality.

Several of Hollywood's most prominent A-listers, such as Jay Leno, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres, have also made their protest against the hotel known.

'These policies, which among other things, could permit women and LGBT Bruneians to be stoned to death, are heinous and certainly don't represent John's values,' his publicist, Amanda Silverman, said in a statement defending his choice to skip the party.

'John does not, in any way, wish to further enrich the Sultan while he continues to enforce these brutal laws.'

The celebrity favourite has come under fire in recent months with some A-listers boycotting the hotel

The Sultan first enacted the laws in October 2015 and as of April, celebrities had already begun calling for a widespread boycott via Twitter.

In May, the Feminist Majority Foundation organised a protest across the street, which was attended by Jay Leno and Francis Fisher, among others.

In response to Los Angeles Confidential's decision to throw a party on site, the Human Rights Campaign also sent a letter, urging them to 'reconsider their decision.'

Still, the magazine has stayed strong in their decision to hold the party in the hotel's Pink Palace Crystal Ballroom.

CEO Katherine Nicholls of parent company Niche Media, which owns the magazine, said: 'To boycott all companies and hotels with affiliations and ownership in nations that do not share our beliefs would cause serious financial harm and damage to the Los Angeles community and the American economy.'
