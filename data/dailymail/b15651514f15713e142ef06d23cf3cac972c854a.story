A brain surgeon's carefully planned holiday marriage proposal turned into a calamity when he lost the engagement ring he’d buried in a beach for his girlfriend to find.

Dr Steve Carr had hoped to propose to Mary Naam by allowing her to discover the diamond encrusted band while the pair dug in the sand.

But the plan went awry when - on the shores of Pelican Bay at Naples, Florida – no ring appeared after they had dug around the pinpointed spot for a few minutes.

Blunder: Brain surgeon Steve Carr, with fiancee Mary Naam, who tried to propose by burying her engagement ring on a Florida beach, only to forget where he put it when the time came

Help: After two hours of searching, the couple called in metal detecting expert Larry Spearing, who found it within minutes

Dr Carr, who had travelled with Miss Naam from their home in Denver, Colorado, said: ‘I’d asked her parents’ permission a couple of days before and I wanted it to happen on this trip.

‘It wasn’t very smart. I wouldn’t recommend doing something so risky.’

However, Dr Carr was determined to pop the question properly and recruited a dozen beachgoers and resort workers to help find the sparkling band.

But after two hours had passed, Miss Naam stepped in to help the bungling brain surgeon and phoned metal detecting expert Larry Spearing, who dug it up in within minutes.

‘We were digging and digging and I thought there was no way we were gonna find it,’ Miss Naam explained.

Happy ending: Dr Carr finally proposes after finding the ring again at Pelican Bay in Naples, Florida

Yes! Miss Naam agrees to the engagement proposal and kisses her new fiance

Staying put: Miss Naam shows off her ring, which she now inisist she won't take off

And, once Dr Carr was finally able to pop the question, his girlfriend happily obliged and they are now engaged to be married.

‘You gotta feel sorry for the guy, digging around in the rain for a couple of hours. How can you say no to that?’ she told ABC7 News.

Dr Carr added: ‘I wasn't worried about the expense at all I just really wanted to be engaged to her.’

Once the ring was safely on, Miss Naam said it was ‘never leaving my finger again’.
