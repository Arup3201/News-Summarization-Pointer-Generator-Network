Running wild: A lioness at Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio has her work cut out after giving birth to three cubs

Exhausting work: First-time mother Imani, who had been on 24-hour baby watch since Saturday, finally welcomed her litter late Thursday

Happy family: The first cub emerged at 3:33pm and its siblings arrived around two hours later

Video footage of the new cat family shows Imani cleaning her cubs as they crawl all over her in an off-exhibit den area.

A keeper from Cincinnati Zoo says that the new mother appears to be 'doing all the right things.'

'The cubs are active and alert and everything is moving in a positive direction,' they added.

In the wild, a lion mother would keep her cubs secluded in a sheltered location. 

Similarly, Imani will stay with her cubs in a private den area until next spring.

Proud parents: Three-year-old Imani was introduced to the zoo’s male lion, four-year-old John, earlier this year and they made for 'excellent companions'

Babies on the way: Imani showed signs of being pregnant in the weeks prior to giving birth and hormone tests indicated a pregnancy 

Imani showed signs of being pregnant in the weeks prior to giving birth and hormone tests confirmed suspicions.

Keepers and scientists at the zoo celebrated the delivery, as it has been almost 15 years since the last set of African lion cubs were born at the center.

The gestation period for lions averages three to four months, and litter size is usually two to six.

Three-year-old Imani was born at the St. Louis Zoo in Missouri and was transferred to the Cincinnati Zoo as the result of a breeding recommendation.

She was introduced to the zoo’s male lion, four-year-old John, earlier this year and they made for 'excellent companions.'

Keepers will monitor the behavior of the inexperienced parents to determine when they will be reunited.
