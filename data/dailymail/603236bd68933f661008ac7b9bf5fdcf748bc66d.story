Portuguese winger Nani has left the door open for a return to Manchester United.

The 28-year-old spent seven years at Old Trafford having joined in 2007, but was loaned out to his former club Sporting Lisbon this summer.

But, after playing in Portugal's 1-0 win over Argentina in Manchester, he insisted that he hasn't yet given up on his career in the Premier League.

When asked about his loan spell at Sporting, Nani said: 'It's great. I'm doing well.

'I'm trying to do my best. Things are going well and I hope it continues like that.'

Then asked if he thought he would return to United, Nani said: 'Why not? I went out to play more and get to my best, and it is an opportunity. We will see.'

Nani has scored five goals in 13 matches so far for the Portuguese side.

It is a return to form the winger desperately needed after making just 22 league appearances in his final two seasons at United.

His last Premier League goal came in September 2012 in a 3-2 defeat by Tottenham and he only registered once in all competitions during the 2013-14 campaign in a 5-0 Champions League win at Bayer Leverkusen.

United are still paying Nani's £120,000 per week wages in full and received no loan fee, although it is understood the move was integral to the signing of Argentine defender Marcos Rojo.
