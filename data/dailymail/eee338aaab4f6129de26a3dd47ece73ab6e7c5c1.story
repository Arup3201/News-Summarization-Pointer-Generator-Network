Ukip tonight announced it had launched an investigation into claims a former candidate sent a series of racist messages on Facebook.

Activist Richard Crouch allegedly claimed his home town on Leicester was a 'sh*thole… full of P***s'.

Messages which appeared on his Facebook account also referred to Asians in Leicester as 'The Taliban' and Romanians as 'pick pocketing criminals'.

Mr Crouch told MailOnline his Facebook page had been hacked and he would never have sent the messages, which were posted on his account between March and December 2013.

He said: 'I never said it. I'm absolutely disgusted with it – it's malicious communication.'

Mr Crouch said he had made an official complaint to Leicestershire Police about the messages posted on his site.

'I've deleted my Facebook account on their advice. It is all totally concocted,' he said.

Mr Crouch added: 'I must've upset someone, but I don't know why – I don't know what I've done to deserve this. I'm just an activist – I'm not a candidate.'

Ukip tonight said allegations Mr Crouch had posted racially abusive material were being investigated.

He said: 'His comments will be investigated and considered at the earliest opportunity by the National Executive Committee.'

A spokesman added: 'We need to be fair to him – he categorically denies that he is responsible for these messages. He denies it has anything to do with him, but we've got to investigate it and that is what we are doing.'

He added that Mr Crouch was a Parish Council candidate, not a Parliamentary candidate.

Leicestershire Police were tonight unable to confirm or deny if Mr Crouch had contacted them about the messages on his Facebook page.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is set to address a Conservative conference in the US tonight before flying back to give his speech to the party's spring conference in Margate

The controversy comes after the chair of Ukip's gay and lesbian group stepped down and resigned his party membership, saying he can no longer 'defend the party or convincingly campaign for it.'

Tom Booker, who founded the LGBTQ in Ukip group three years ago, announced he was standing down on Twitter last night, saying he wasn't able to support the party's manifesto.

He said: 'Last night I stepped down as Chairman of LGBT in UKIP and gave up my membership of #ukip. I'll remain unaffiliated…for now ;-)'

In a series of replies to questions on Twitter, he explained that he 'couldn't defend the party or convincingly campaign for it any more.'

He also said the party was 'a long way from classical liberal these days.'

Booker gave a statement to Pink News, saying he was dissatisfied at the 'failure of the leadership to set a gay-friendly tone.'
