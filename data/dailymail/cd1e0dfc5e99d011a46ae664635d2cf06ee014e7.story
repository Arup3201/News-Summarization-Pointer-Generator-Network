A grove of hemlock trees at the Pennsylvania Flight 93 Memorial is under threat after being infested by an invasive insect.

The hemlocks, often referred to as 'witness trees,' near where the hijacked plane crashed in Shanksville on September 11, 2001, have been invaded by the hemlock woolly adelgid, a tiny insect that feeds by sucking sap from the trees.

A spokesperson from the Flight 93 National Memorial said Wednesday that the hemlocks are infested with the insect, which can kill trees within a few years, but hope a treatment plan will be able to save them.

The insect was accidentally introduced to the U.S. from Asia in 1924, and figures from 2007 show that 50 per cent of the geographic range of eastern hemlock had been impacted by the insect.'I would say the stand is prettily heavily infested,' Rick Turcotte, an entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service, told The Associated Press.

'Trees are showing fairly significant impact,' such as reduced growth, thinning of the crown, and off color needles.

United Flight 93 was traveling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco in 2001 when it was hijacked by four terrorists.

The 33 passengers and seven crew members were killed when the plane crashed after passengers fought back against hijackers.

Plot: Flight 93 was one of four planes that were hijacked as part of the September 11 attacks; 44 people, including four terrorists, died in the crash

The 9/11 Commission said the terrorists likely wanted to crash the plane into the White House or the U.S. Capitol.

The
National Park Service refers to the meadow and hemlock grove where the 
plane crashed as the 'sacred ground,' because it's the final resting 
place for many of the remains of the passengers and crew.

Woolly adelgids, which are native to Asia, lay their eggs on the underside of hemlock branches, and the young insects feed on the sap of the trees, causing them to lose needles and die within five to 10 years.

The insects appeared in Virginia in the 1950s and in southeastern Pennsylvania in 1969. They've been spreading north and west ever since.

Turcotte said the Forest Service is 
working with the National Park Service on a treatment plan for more than
1,300 mature trees in the roughly 11-acre grove of hemlocks that will begin this week.

They're 
trying chemicals and even releasing a species of beetles that eats the 
adelgids, which have no natural predators in the area.

In
some other states and regions, adelgids have caused massive die-offs of
hemlocks, and scientists still aren't sure if they'll be able to save 
the Flight 93 grove.

'In the big picture we don't really know if it's a losing battle,' Turcotte said of area. 'We're trying to maintain it in the condition it was in at the time of the crash.'The Flight 93 National Memorial is located in Shanksville, about 75 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The memorial drew about 320,000 visitors last year.
