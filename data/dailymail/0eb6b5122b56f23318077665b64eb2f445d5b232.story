Two pensioners have tied the knot after being sent on a blind date by the funeral director who arranged their spouses' funerals. 

Tom Lennon, 76, and his now wife Isabell, 70, from Wickford, Essex, worked with undertaker Lynne Love after she helped arranged the funerals of their respective partners Alice and Bob.

After the funerals, Ms Love, who works at The Co-operative Funeralcare, stayed in touch with the pair and would sometimes meet them for a cup of tea.

Tom Lennon, 76, and his wife Isabell, 70, from Wickford, Essex, went on a
 blind date in January after being set up by the funeral director who had arranged their spouses' funerals

Six months later after being set up by Lynne Love, 54, pictured centre, the pair tied the knot. Ms Love took the action after both former clients said they felt lonely

But when the pair both complained about being lonely,  the 54-year-old wanted to do something about it.

She realised that they would be the perfect match - and decided to set the pair up on a date.

Just six months after meeting in January, Mr and Mrs Lennon were married at Brentwood registry office - with Ms Love as their witness.

She said: 'I had the great honour of attending the wedding and being a witness. I'm not the mushiest person but I cried all the way through.

'I think if I died tomorrow, this would be my greatest achievement.'

The pair met for the first time after Ms Love gave Mr Lennon, whose wife died in May last year, his future wife's number.

Mr Lennon, a retired mortuary worker and 
caretaker, said: 'Loneliness is a terrible thing. If it hadn't been for 
Lynne I would never have met Isabell and realised that people like her 
existed.

'I plucked up the courage to ring her after Lynne gave me her number and we just clicked - we haven't looked back since.

'Isabell is the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'm as happy as a sandboy. She's 100% diamond and her family have made me feel so welcome.'

Mrs Lennon, who husband died in 2011, added: 'I have found my soul mate. He is the most kind and caring man and I have laughed constantly since we met.

'Our families are delighted for us both to have found such happiness in later life.'

The retired nurse, who is a mother of two and grandmother of six, added: 'Lynne became a good friend due to bereavement on both our parts.

'She stopped me one day and said she knew a nice man who was looking for a bit of company and could she give him my number.

'I agreed and we arranged to go for a drink that evening at the local pub. The next night we had a meal together and the relationship just blossomed from there.

'Our wedding day was a beautiful occasion - my two daughters helped to organise it and we had a lovely day with family and friends.

'I am just so happy we found each other. It's not often you find love through a funeral director.'

Mrs Lennon, right, said she has found her soul mate, while Mr Lennon, left, said his wife is the best thing that has ever happened to him

Ms Love said: 'I always keep in touch with customers as it's nice to have a cup of tea and a chat with a friendly face.

'After chatting with Isabell one day, it came to mind that the pair of them would be very well suited.

'It is great that they have both been able to find happiness again and it has given them a new lease of life.

'With the job I do comes a lot of sadness but it is nice something good can come out of it.'
