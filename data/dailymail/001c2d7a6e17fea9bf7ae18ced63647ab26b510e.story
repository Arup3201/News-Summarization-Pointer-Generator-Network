This horrific picture shows the appalling injuries suffered by a cyclist when he was thrown from his bike on his way to work after hitting a giant pothole.

Richard Gummery, 45, was pedalling downhill at 30mph but didn’t spot the massive crater - which was 18 inches long and 5inches deep.

The father-of-one - who cycles 70 miles a week - was catapulted off his bike and suffered a broken elbow as well as multiple cuts to his face and head.

He was taken to hospital by his brother where doctors discovered he had shattered a bone in his elbow.

Horrific: Richard Gummery at hospital after he broke his arm and gashed his face after crashing into a pothole on his bicycle.

Shocking pictures taken at Hereford County Hospital’s A&E show Mr Gummery's face caked in blood following the painful fall.

He needed an emergency three-hour operation and spent two nights in hospital before being sent home in a plaster cast to recover.

Today, Mr Gummery, who lives in Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, blasted his local council for not doing more to keep the roads safe.

He said: 'You often have people like me who work early hours and when you cannot see the potholes it becomes particularly difficult.

'The main roads are okay, but the side roads are appalling. Tidying up the roads must be one of Herefordshire Council’s top priorities.

'I’ve been cycling for 20 years and on the side roads it has definitely got worse. Once they are there and reported, they should be filled in.

'People pay their council taxes and all you ask is they collect the bins on time and keep the roads tidy.

'But it has obviously not been happening.'

He was on his way to work at Boots in Hereford at 5.15am on March 19 when he hit the pothole.

He was taken to hospital and had the operation on his elbow the next day before being sent home on March 21.

Mr Gummery said he had cycled the seven-and-a-half mile journey five days a week for the last 20 years but this is the first time he has had a serious accident.

He added: 'I had my lights on but I didn’t see the pothole.

'I cycle every day to work at Boots and normally I go straight down and stick to the A and B roads.'But I decided to go down Knocker Hill Lane which is a country road and was going downhill so probably going at 30mph when I hit the pothole.

'I didn’t quite go over the handlebars but went down and made sure my body took the impact.

'I landed on my elbow, which ended up broken and also had lots of grazes on the side of my face.

'I shattered a bone in my elbow which required a plate and screws and was operated on the next day.

'It’s not too painful now but there’s a huge cast on it and it’s restrictive but hopefully I’ll be more mobile in a few weeks time.'

Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin confirmed this week that Herefordshire Council will get £3,538,803 for road repairs following the wet winter and North Herefordshire’s Tory MP Bill Wiggin has urged the council to use the money to make the roads safe.

He said: 'We desperately need to act to fix the potholes on our roads to make the county safe again for cyclists and motorists.'
