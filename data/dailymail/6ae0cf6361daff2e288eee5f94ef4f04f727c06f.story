Arsenal appear to have received a boost in the race to sign Gabriel Paulista in January as Villarreal have left the £15million-rated defender out of their squad to face Levante at the weekend.

Villarreal announced the 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal and listed the players who would miss the match through injury or suspension.

However Paulista's name was left off the official club announcement altogether, which suggests he has moved a step closer to leaving the Spanish outfit.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is keen on bringing in Gabrial Paulista from Villarreal this month

Arsenal may find it difficult in obtaining a work permit for the Brazilian defender  

The Gunners are in talks with Villarreal over a move for the Brazilian although he will face problems in obtaining a work permit as he hasn't played international football.

Work permit rules change in the summer, allowing players who cost £10m and over an automatic permit.

But as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Arsenal will appeal any decision not to give Paulista - who has a £15m buy-out clause - a permit this month in an attempt to land him now.

And Wenger confirmed: 'The talks are progressing quite well with Villarreal for Paulista. We are talking at the moment and slowly progressing. We are ready to pay the price for a good player.

'We want the player and if he needs a work permit we will defend it now.'
