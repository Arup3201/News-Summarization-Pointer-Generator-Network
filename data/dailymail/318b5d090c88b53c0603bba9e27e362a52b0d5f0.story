A mobile phone found at the scene of a brutal axe murder in which three members of the same family were killed was used to search details of an infamous U.S. axe killing.

Parents Teresa van Breda, 54, and Martin, 55, and their eldest son Rudi, 22, were found dead at the family home in Stellenbosch, 50 kilometres east of Cape Town, in January.

Henri van Breda, 20, suffered what police sources reportedly said were 'self-inflicted' wounds following the bloodbath at his family home.

His sister Marli, 16, was the only other survivor of the horrific attack, but is still in no fit state to talk about the slaughter which left her with a slashed jugular vein and severe head injuries.

Forensic police officers reportedly analysed the search histories of phones and computers in the house and found one mobile had been used to look up an axe attack carried out by a U.S. man on his parents in 2004, news24 reported.

The phone was used to look up information about the attack on Peter and Joan Porco by their then-21-year-old son Christopher, which left Peter dead and Joan severely wounded. It was not said whose mobile phone was used to make the search.

Porco is serving a prison sentence of 50 years to life

Porco was convicted of murder and attempted murder and is serving a prison sentence of 50 years to life.

The case attracted a high level of media attention due to the fact Joan maintained her son's innocence during the trial and refused to testify against him.

The story was the subject of a Lifetime movie titled 'Romeo Killer: The Chris Porco Story', which aired in 2013 and portrayed Porco as a wannabe playboy who attacked his parents after they complained about his bad college grades and wasteful spending.  

This comes after it emerged  both surviving Van Breda children have lawyers representing them in the division of their parents' ten million pound ($A19 million) fortune, South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper reported.

Henri, who has been cared for by relatives since the attack, has a legal team led by Pieter Botha, who successfully fought to have his client Shrien Dewani cleared of the murder of his new bride, Anni.

A lawyer has also been appointed for Marli, who is under police guard while she recovers at an exclusive rehabilitation unit.

The attack, which took place in the early hours of the morning in the family's upstairs bedrooms seven weeks ago, claimed the lives of the children's mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22

Forensic evidence gathered at the scene, including the murder weapon, bloodied footprints and handprints is already with state prosecutors who believe they have sufficient material to make an arrest, even without Marli's eye witness account.

Mr van Breda was a successful businessman who had enterprises in South Africa and Australia, where the family lived in Perth for seven years before returning to Cape Town last year.

The home where the attack took place, on De Zalze secure golf estate in the winelands outside Cape Town, is among the assets to be sold off. Neighbours expressed shock that a killer unknown to the family could have entered and left the highly-guarded compound undetected by security guards and cameras.

Physics student Henri, who called for help more than three hours after the brutal attack, claimed a man wielding an axe had set upon his loved ones while he was in a bathroom. When he emerged from the bathroom he killer hurled the murder weapon at him and knocked him unconscious.

A recording of the call was leaked to the media. In it, Henri is heard to giggle as he is quizzed by the operator about the details of the attack.

When asked if his family were unconscious, he replied, 'yes and bleeding from the head' before what sounds like a quiet laugh can be heard.

According to South Africa's YOU magazine, Henri has returned once to the scene of the killing, to collect some clothes and other belongings. However, he has not been allowed to see his sister since the incident, and she has been informed that her parents and brother Rudi are dead.

A teenager living in a shack near the family's home also told the Sunday Times how he had been paid by Henri as a drug runner – and regularly delivered crystal meth to him, or 'tik' as it is known in South Africa. According to some reports, Henri had spent some time in an exclusive rehabilitation clinic, and had had his allowance cut by his parents shortly before the murders.

A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family', they had previously lived in Perth 

Mrs van Breda's brother, Andre du Toit is the guardian to both surviving children and Henri is being cared for by him and his wife at their home.

A spokesman for the family, Ben Rootman, confirmed that, 'a joint Will drawn up in South Africa determines that a trust and the children born from the marriage inherit the South African estate. The family also had assets in Australia and these have been left to the South African families and to the trustees of the trust. These assets have not yet been fully determined.'

According to South African law, the process of settling an estate is halted if an heir is arrested on a charge of murder and will only resume after court proceedings have been finalized. An heir is disqualified from inheriting if found guilty of murder.
