This picture graphic shows the shear enormity of the African continent by showing how many other countries fit inside it.

It covers the same surface as 13 countries - including the United States, China and India - and the whole of Eastern Europe.

The UK also features on the graphic - covering the island of Madagascar.

In total, Africa is more than 30million sq km.

But this graphic illustrates that its size is not shown accurately on a standard Mercator map, where countries in the centre appear smaller than they are.

According to designer IO9, accuracy is compromised for neatness and 'straight lines'.

This graphic shows Africa is bigger than the land masses of the US, China, India, Mexico, Peru, France, Spain, Papua New Guinea, Sweden, Japan, Germany, Norway, Italy, New Zealand, the UK, Nepal, Bangladesh and Greece put together.

It also lists the top 100 countries in the world in terms of biggest land size.

Russia (more than 17 km-squared), Canada, China, the US and Brazil make up the top five.

A standard Mercator world map does not truly reflect the landmass of Africa

The graphic also demonstrates how easily the whole of Europe would fit into Africa, as well as some of the biggest nations in the world individually.

Creator Kai Krause overlayed Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK, Japan, China, India, Eastern Europe, Italy, Germany, France, Spain and the US on to the continent.
