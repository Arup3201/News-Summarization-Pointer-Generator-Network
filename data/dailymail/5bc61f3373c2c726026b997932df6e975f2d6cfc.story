From the little girl playing on the pier at Ramsgate to the suited and booted sunbather, his eyes covered in a tissue, late photographer Tony Ray-Jones was an expert at capturing the English on film in all their eccentric glory.

Now the work of the Somerset-born shutterbug will go on display for the first time in London in an exhibition at the Science Museum.

Among the 118 images to feature, most of which date from the 1960s, are 55 rarely seen snaps, including one that shows holidaymakers posing with their caravan in Morecambe and another that features day-trippers relaxing by their car in Worthing.

Between 1966 and 1969, Ray-Jones created a body of work documenting English customs and identity.

'Tony Ray-Jones' pictures were about England,' says Martin Parr, a contemporary whose work, dating from the 1970s, also features in the exhibition.

'They had
that contrast, that seedy eccentricity, but they showed it in a very 
subtle way. They have an ambiguity, a visual anarchy. They showed me 
what was possible.'

They quickly attracted the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where they were exhibited in 1969.

But Ray-Jones' career was cut tragically short when he died from Leukaemia aged just 30 in 1972.

Nevertheless, say experts, his short 
career had a huge impact on the development of British photography, 
particularly in normalising the use of candid shots.

Among the images are scenes that reveal the British penchant for seaside holidays, including a charming photo of day trippers aboard a small boat setting off from Beachy Head in East Sussex and carnival goers enjoying a parade in Eastbourne.

Parr's work, taken almost a decade after Ray-Jones, reveals how little appeared to change between the 1960s and 70s and and includes a quirky shot of a pair of elderly ladies dozing off during a service at a Methodist church in Todmorden in Yorkshire.

'The combination of Martin Parr and Tony Ray-Jones’s work will allow the viewer to trace an important trajectory through the history of British photography,' explains curator Greg Hobson.

'[It will] present new ways of thinking about photographic histories through creative use of our collections.’

The exhibition, entitled Only in England: Photographs by Tony Ray-Jones and Martin Parr, and which opened on Friday, will run until the 16th March 2014.
