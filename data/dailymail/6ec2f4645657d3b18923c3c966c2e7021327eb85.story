A tiny gorilla baby took a break from monkeying about whilst clinging on to the safety of his mother's arm.

The intimate moment was captured by a photographer at North Carolina Zoological Park where sleepy one-month-old Bomassa lives with his mother Jamani.

Bomassa is the first gorilla to be born at the zoo since 1989 and the second in the history of the park.

The nap was a welcome moment of peace for 
12-year-old new mother Jamani, named after the Swahili word for 
'friend', who has her hands full taking care of the active youngster.

A zoo spokesman said: ‘Bomassa is strong and active, and the mother is providing good maternal care.

‘In
keeping with traditional policy, the naming was done by the zoo's 
gorilla keepers. Bomassa is a town and region in the Republic of Congo 
in central Africa closely associated with gorilla research.’

Gorillas
in captivity are kept with the same social structure as in the wild, 
with one silverback male, several females and their offspring.

Care: The tiny baby gorilla was born on August 4 this year, and is the second to be born at the zoo

Bomassa
will be staying with his mother and the other gorillas at the zoo until
he is ten years old when he be moved to avoid posing a threat to his 
father, silverback Nkosi.

Dr.
Kristen Lukas, chairman for the Gorilla SSP said: ‘We are thrilled 
to hear of this birth and very pleased to learn that the mother is 
taking such great care of her infant.’

The North Carolina Zoological Park is located south of Asheboro and is the largest natural habitat zoo in the world.
