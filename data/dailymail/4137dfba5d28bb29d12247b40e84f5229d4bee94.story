A school at the centre of an alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ Islamist plot paid private detectives to snoop on staff emails, inspectors have found.

Governors at Saltley School are accused in an Ofsted report of spending ‘substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit’ including on consultants and lawyers.

Some faculty members complained to inspectors they were ‘treated unequally because of their beliefs, religion or background’.

The Birmingham school – where the head was allegedly forced out by conservative Muslim governors – is almost certain to be placed in special measures.

Saltley School in Birmingham - which is at the centre of an alleged 'Trojan Horse' Islamist plot - is accused in an Ofsted report of spending 'substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit' on consultants and lawyers

It is among six expected to be given Ofsted’s lowest possible rating next week when the watchdog publishes the findings of its investigations into 21 Birmingham schools.  Michael Gove is expected to remove heads or governors of schools where inspectors have identified concerns.

The Education Secretary will address the Commons on Monday – after Ofsted has released the results of its three-month inquiry.

Staff will be asked to take training programmes to help them combat radicalisation and extremism.

The Ofsted reports are likely to disclose that some schools are narrowing the curriculum even to the extent that music is being banned. 

The mass inspections followed the emergence of a letter purporting to describe a five-step ‘Trojan Horse’ strategy for imposing a hardline Islamic agenda on state schools. While its authenticity is disputed, the claims themselves have been taken seriously and are being studied in depth.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, will highlight a series of concerns about practices in some of the schools, including unequal treatment of boys and girls, a narrow curriculum that denies pupils a rounded education and governors intent on changing the character of schools.

A separate Department for Education investigation found evidence of girls being forced to sit at the back and sides of classrooms and GCSE subjects being restricted ‘to comply with conservative Islamic teaching’.

Ofsted’s report on Saltley School, which was leaked to BBC West Midlands, contains criticism of governors’ use of school funds, saying they ‘paid private investigators to interrogate [sic] the emails of senior staff’ and has ‘spent substantial amounts of money with no obvious benefit’.

Governance of the school was judged inadequate. ‘Many of the governors refuse to accept that the school is in a state of crisis,’ it is claimed.

Birmingham City Council, which is accused of being slow to respond to the school’s decline, refused to comment yesterday. Balwant Bains, the school’s non-Muslim head, resigned late last year.

An Ofsted inspection shortly before he stepped down criticised a ‘dysfunctional relationship’ between him and the governors. The school has strongly denied any suggestion that Mr Bains was forced out.

Birmingham council’s investigation into the Trojan Horse claims will be released next month along with a separate inquiry by Peter Clarke, Scotland Yard’s former counter-terrorism chief.

Teenagers are being taught jihad at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse scandal.

Lessons at Park View School in Birmingham suggest it can be justifiable for Muslims to take up arms in a holy war and that jihadists suffer from negative stereotyping in the media.

The school’s website describes how a lesson is devoted to jihad under a section on ‘Living The Muslim Life’. Pupils study topics such as ‘what is a just war?’, ‘when can Muslims take up arms?’ and ‘conditions of jihad’.

Park View claims to follow Edexcel’s religious studies GCSE syllabus but referring to stereotyping and just wars, an Edexcel spokesman said: ‘The content in question is not represented in our specification … Schools do have the choice to add to the defined syllabus.’ 

The researcher who alerted the Department of Education, and asked not to be named, said: ‘Muslim children aren’t being given a fair chance to become part of society with this.’ 

A Park View spokesman said teaching is supported by Edexcel resources, adding: ‘This includes understanding the concepts of greater and lesser jihad and media representation.’
