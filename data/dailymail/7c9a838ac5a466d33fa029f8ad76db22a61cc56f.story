France is braced for a Muslim backlash after its government backed the publication of cartoons depicting a wheelchair-bound Prophet Muhammad being pushed by a rabbi.

It will close 20 embassies and schools across Islamic countries tomorrow, and has warned its citizens abroad to take care.

Foreign minister Laurent Fabius admitted that satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo’s provocative cartoons, one of which appeared on its front cover, would ‘throw oil on the fire’ of recent anger over an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S.

Tensions running high: The cartoons in the satirical publication made reference to the U.S.-made anti-Islam film which has sparked violence around the world

However, he defended freedom of expression, adding that the fundamental right could only be limited ‘by court decisions’.

Mr Fabius said embassy security was 
being stepped up in Muslim countries, and that riot police in major 
cities would receive reinforcements.

As France plunged into a fierce debate
 about free speech, the government defended Charlie Hebdo's right to 
publish the drawings and said it would also block a protest planned by 
people angry over the anti-Islam movie The Innocence Of Muslims.

The amateurish film, which portrays 
the prophet as a fraud, a womaniser and a child molester, has set off 
violence in seven countries that has killed at least 28 people, 
including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.

CFCM, an umbrella group for French 
Muslims, issued a statement expressing 'deep concern' over the 
caricatures and warning that 'in a very tense context, it risks 
exacerbating tensions and provoking reactions.'

It urged French Muslims to 'not cede to provocation and ... express their indignation in peace via legal means.'

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 
organisers of a demonstration planned for Saturday against The Innocence
 Of Muslims film won't receive police authorisation.

'There's no reason for us to let a 
conflict that doesn't concern France come into our country,' Mr Ayrault 
told French radio RTL.

Paris prosecutors have opened an 
investigation into an unauthorised protest last Saturday around the U.S.
 Embassy that drew about 150 people and led to scores of arrests.

The tensions surrounding the film are provoking debate in France about the limits of free speech.

The magazine's editor, originally a 
cartoonist who uses the name Charb, said the images would 'shock those 
who will want to be shocked'.

'The freedom of the press, is that a 
provocation?' he said. 'I'm not asking strict Muslims to read Charlie 
Hebdo, just like I wouldn't go to a mosque to listen to speeches that go
 against everything I believe.'

A small-circulation weekly, Charlie 
Hebdo often draws attention for ridiculing sensitivity around the 
Prophet Muhammad. An investigation is underway into the firebombing of 
its offices after it released an edition that mocked radical Islam last 
year.

The magazine's website was down yesterday for reasons that were unclear.

One of the cartoonists, who goes by 
the name of Tignous, defended the drawings in an interview yesterday at 
the weekly's offices on the northeast edge of Paris amid a cluster of 
housing estates.

'It's just a drawing,' he said. 'It's not a provocation'.

The prime minister said freedom of 
expression is guaranteed in France, but cautioned that it 'should be 
exercised with responsibility and respect.'

On the streets of Paris, public reaction was mixed.

'I'm not shocked at all. If this 
shocks people, well too bad for them,' said a 
21-year-old student at the Sorbonne, who did not wish to be named.

'We are free to say what we want. We 
are a country in which freedom prevails and ... if this doesn't enchant 
some people, well too bad for them.'

Khairreddene Chabbara disagreed. 'We 
are for freedom of expression, but when it comes to religion it 
shouldn't hurt the feelings of believers.'

Yesterday a small bomb exploded at a 
kosher grocer’s in a Paris suburb, wounding at least one. Police said it
 was too early to link the attack to the cartoons.

The Arab League has issued a statement
 calling for ‘those who were hurt by those offensive drawings to control
 themselves and use peaceful means to firmly express their rejection of 
such shameful actions’.

In 2005, a Danish newspaper sparked global controversy by publishing several cartoons depicting Muhammad.

Charlie Hebdo's latest issue has already sold out at Paris newsagents.
