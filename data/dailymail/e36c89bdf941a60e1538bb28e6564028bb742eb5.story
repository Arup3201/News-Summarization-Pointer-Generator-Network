He's never afraid of being outspoken on Strictly Come Dancing.

When it comes to affairs of the heart, however, it turns out Len Goodman is rather good at keeping quiet.

The 68-year-old married his long-term girlfriend yesterday in a surprise ceremony. The 30 family and friends he invited thought they were attending a quiet Sunday lunch – until the registrar arrived.

Third time lucky! Len Goodman and Sue Barrett arrive for their surprise wedding at Mosimann's in London

Goodman, head judge on BBC1's dance show, had been with Sue Barrett, 47, a dance teacher, for more than ten years.

It's third time lucky for Goodman. At 28, he married his champion dance partner Cherry, but they divorced a few years later. He then had a long-term partner, Lesley, with whom he had a son, James.

He told the Daily Mail yesterday: 'I've had a marvellous day, and now my gorgeous Sue is the new Mrs Goodman.

'Did I pickle my walnuts? Of course I did! I wanted it to be a low-key affair, so we didn't tell anyone except my 96-year-old mum as I didn't want her having a heart attack with the surprise.'

Asked if he got down on one knee, he laughed and replied: 'At my age, no way! I made her go four stairs above me on the staircase so at least she was taller than me, does that count?

'We've had a marvellous day, with marvellous food surrounded by all my dearest friends – and it didn't go on for too long so it didn't get boring!'

Among the guests was close friend and Strictly professional Anton du Beke. He and Goodman celebrated afterwards with a little waltz outside exclusive Mosimann's private dining club in London's Belgravia.

The dancer, who arrived with a glamorous blonde on his arm, said: 'I didn't know a thing about Len getting married. It was a complete surprise – hilarious really, but completely marvellous.'

Aside from Du Beke, the ceremony was a distinctly unstarry affair.

Absent: Strictly presenters Tess Daly and Sir Bruce Forsyth and Goodman's fellow judges were not at the wedding

Tess Daly, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Goodman's fellow judges Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood were all absent. Not that the wedding – which cost £25,000 – lacked glamour.

Guests were treated to a champagne reception on the mezzanine balcony overlooking the central restaurant, which Goodman paid £10,000 to hire.

The couple, both dressed in blue, were married in a private room by Westminster superintendent registrar  Alison Cathcart.

After the short ceremony at 2pm, their guests sat down to a sumptuous five-course lunch. There was a choice of prawn cocktail or Asian-style pumpkin soup to start, followed by mushroom risotto.

For the main course guests could 
choose between seabass or English lamb with stir-fried vegetables, with 
cheese and 'old school' apple crumble to finish.

The happy couple then - of course - took to the floor for, as Goodman put it, 'a spot of dance-teacher dancing.'

The
Strictly judge, who officially registered his intention to marry in 
August, said: 'I've been going out with my lovely Sue for  ages and I 
decided it was time to pop  the question.

'She's
gorgeous and makes me very happy – though she likes to stay out of the 
limelight. It was a complete surprise to my friends and family today and
we've had a fabulous time.'
