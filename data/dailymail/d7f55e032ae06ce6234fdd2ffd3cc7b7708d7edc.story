A devastated mother has spoken of her anguish at witnessing a teenager drown in a reservoir tragedy, not realising it was her own son.

Melanie Goodship, 40, was walking her dogs when she saw a group of screaming teenagers struggling as the makeshift raft they were playing on began drifting out of control. 

The civil servant rushed to the group’s aid only to learn her son James, 17, had disappeared under the freezing water whilst attempting to get help.

Help: James had tried to swim to get help when the raft he and his friends were playing on began to drift

'When we were walking the dogs around the reservoir we saw all the commotion but not for one minute did we know it might be James until we saw a couple of his friends,' Ms Goodship said, speaking after an inquest into her son's death. 

'I was trying to phone James but there was no answer but I was thinking it’s ringing so he can’t be in the water because it was ringing but what we didn’t know is his phones had been left on the side.

'My heart just sank but we couldn’t have done anything. We were too far away. By this time the air ambulance had landed. He must have been under for some time at that point.'

James's body was found in the reservoir the following morning. Another teenager who tried to make the swim with him had to be treated for hypothermia.

An inquest was told the accident occurred on June 22 this year, after James - who had just finished the first year of a plumbing apprenticeship - joined six friends for a summer’s walk around Lake Burwain in Colne, Lancashire.

The group spotted the raft, made out of wood with plastic barrels underneath, by a jetty near a boathouse and decided to have a look.

Desperation: Ms Goodship rushed to the group’s aid only to learn her son had disappeared under the freezing water whilst attempting to get help

One member of the group, Keaton Greaves, 16, told the hearing in Burnley in a statement that two girls, who were afraid of water, opted to sit on the grassy area and look after their friends' belongings including mobile phones.

In a statement read to the hearing he added: 'We jumped down onto the wooden jetty onto the raft which was attached with a rope. But we drifted away from the shore towards the middle of the reservoir.

'Most of us tried to paddle with our hands but it didn’t work the current was quite strong forcing us the other way. I wasn’t scared or worried but I knew we had to get the raft back.' 

The inquest heard that after around an hour the group decided they needed to do something, and estimated the vessel was about 50 metres from the shore. 

Keaton said: 'I decided to try to swim to shore to get help. James said he was going to swim as well. I sat down on the edge of the raft and slipped into the water. I took a couple of strokes out into the water and James dived in after me.'

He added that James, who was described as a good swimmer, had taken his T-shirt off but had kept his trainers on.

Mission: A search and rescue operation was launched the day after James was last seen, and his body was recovered by underwater search units

Tributes: A floral tribute left at the reservoir, close to the spot where James drowned

Mourning: Friends of the tragic teenager gather at the lake after his death in June

'I started to feel exhausted, the weight of clothes weighing me down, pulling me down,' said Keaton.

He added that the friends who were still aboard the raft started to call for him to come back and that James had been ahead of him.

Keaton said that he began to make his way towards the raft swimming on his back whilst trying to keep his head up.

'I was so tired,' he said. 

'I knew I wasn’t going to make it to the shore. I could hear James but I couldn’t see him. As I got near the raft I was really struggling. I have never felt anything like it, it just froze your body, I couldn’t move, it was horrible.'

The inquest heard Keaton was pulled aboard and lay on the raft 'freezing cold' as his friends tried to cover him up.

The statement added: 'I heard the others shouting "go on you’re nearly there" I couldn’t see where he was. I did hear him shout for help at one point. I knew when I heard him he was in trouble because I knew how he felt. The others on the boat saw him go under, when he didn’t come up everyone started crying.'

Keaton was rescued by emergency services and was taken to Airedale Hospital. A search and rescue operation was launched the following day at 5.30am and James’ body was recovered by underwater search units.

Eyewitness Paul Bleasdale said: 'I heard a splash in the water and I decided to call the local police because I knew the water was cold. I told the operator there were kids in the water and appeared to be having fun and they said they’d send someone when they could.

'Soon after the laughs changed to shouts and I saw two kids swimming, it looked as if one had gone in after the other.'

He added that he heard a male voice say 'I can’t do it' as he swam towards the two girls sat on the side who became 'hysterical, crying and shouting'.

Paying tribute to James, his uncle Paul Goodship told the inquest: 'James was a fun loving lad who loved life always had a smile on his face and managed to put a smile on most other people’s face too. 

'He was always full of adventure and even though he was very brash and sometimes wanted to be Mr hardman he was a very caring lad. It’s probably been one of the hardest parts of his character and nature that we have missed. He brought people together he just had that sort of personality and character.'

Support: Ms Goodship is supported by a friend as she leaves the inquest into James's death

East Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of accidental death.

'This appears to me to be a very very cruel accident that has taken this young man away,' he said.

Speaking after the hearing, Ms Goodship  said she hoped other young people could learn from his death.

'Sadly this goes to show what started out as having fun and messing around can end in tragedy,' she said. 

'I just hope lessons can be learnt.

She added: 'All his friends watched it happen. It’s terrible. I wouldn’t want any family to go through what we have. If we can just get the education out there to the children of the dangers of open water, that is one of the most important things for us.'
