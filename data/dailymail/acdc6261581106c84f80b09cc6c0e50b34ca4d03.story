Kira Griffiths, 25, received abusive text messages after she used taxi app goCatch to book a ride for a colleague on Tuesday

A Melbourne woman says she fears for her safety after she received multiple abusive text messages from a taxi driver when she failed to get into a ride booked using a smartphone app.

This comes as the taxi industry has warned that independent apps which provide direct customer-to-driver contact can leave passengers open to abuse.

Kira Griffiths, 25, used taxi app goCatch to book a taxi for a colleague on Tuesday but when she walked outside she could not find the cab, so her colleague walked up the road to get another one.

Ms Griffiths then received three text messages and a missed phone call from taxi driver Arif Hameed calling her a number of derogatory names because she wasted his time.

'F***in b****,' one message read.

'I curse you s*** w**** someone will waste ur time like u did mine b****,' read another.

Mr Hameed told MailOnline on Thursday he felt his privacy had been violated because Ms Griffiths posted his phone number onto her Facebook page along with his abusive messages.

'Since that day I am getting calls from private numbers and people are abusing me,' he said.

'I have her phone number I can give it to the media too but I won't do that.'

Mr Hameed said he knew his actions were wrong but he was upset that Ms Griffiths made him wait.

'When I went there I gave her a call and she said I'm coming out. Twenty minutes I waited,' he said.

'Our time is important as well. That's what frustrated me I just lost myself for two minutes.'

He added that he had tried to apologise to Ms Griffiths via email through the taxi company he works for, Silver Top Taxis Melbourne.

GoCatch said the company had blocked Mr Hameed permanently,Â  and said it has banned more than 500 drivers in the past three months for not meeting professional standards.

GoCatch is an app independent from a taxi network, which connects registered taxi drivers with passengers directly by giving drivers passengers' mobile numbers.

Ms Griffiths, a sales and marketing assistant, said the experience was scary and she was having trouble sleeping.

'It was such a personal attack on me over such a little thing,' Ms Griffiths told MailOnline.

'He could have been outside ready to go inside because he knew the pickup address.

'He could come back here. He's seen my face now which is the more scary bit.'

Ms Griffith said she was even more worried now because her complaints will see Mr Hameed potentially lose his taxi license and he still has her phone number.

'Thoughts have gone through my mind like that which is not nice,' she said.

'The reason I have those thoughts is because it was such an irrational and unnecessary action [over wasting his time].

'Because what I've done now is worse, he could do worse than just the text message.'

Australian Taxi Industry Association chief Blair Davies, who represents the taxi networks in competition with apps such as GoCatch, said passengers have a right to keep their contact details private.

'It's a flaw in the system which allows their details be available to a driver and for the driver to then be able to harass them,' Mr Davies said.

'And it's good to be able to have somebody like a taxi company who provides a screening point or a booking point.'

Ms Griffiths has complained to Silver Top Taxi Melbourne and the Victorian Taxi Services Commission.

The Victorian Taxi Services Commission told MailOnline the matter is being investigated.

Silver Top did not respond to the MailOnline's request for comment.

GoCatch CEO Andrew Campbell said the driver's account had been permanently suspended and the company had apologised to Ms Griffiths.

'The company condemns the actions of this irresponsible driver in the strongest possible terms,' he said.

'We have provided his data and details to the Victorian Taxi Services Commission for investigation and in all likelihood he will never drive a taxi again.'

He added  that by reducing anonymity goCatch was making taxis safer.

'For example if you just flagged a taxi on the street and the driver drops you at home and then starts harassing you, you don't know who he is, you have little recourse,' he said.

'But with goCatch we've got all the data and all the details so they can be passed on to the regulators or the police if need be.'

Graeme Samuel, chair of the Victorian Taxi Services Commission, said millions of people use apps like goCatch, Ingogo and Uber across the world.

'It's a matter of choice for customers if they want to provide their phone numbers, if they don't they won't use the app,' Mr Samuel said.

'I don't think it's a question of regulators stepping in.'
