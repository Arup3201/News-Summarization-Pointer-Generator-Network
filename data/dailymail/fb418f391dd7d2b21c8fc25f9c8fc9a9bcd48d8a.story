Two Alabama men have been charged with imprisoning and filming their sexual abuse of a minor for use in child pornography made with the son of one of the accused.

Domestic partners Charles Dunnavant and Carl Herold face a litany of charges ranging from sexual torture and sodomy to exposing a person to an STD and child pornography production.

Authorities are seeking a $1million cash bond for each of the accused, the boy was Herold’s son according to reports.

The young boy, only nine-years-old, was held hostage in the Huntsville house of horrors for eight months, during which he was sexually assaulted, abused, sodomized and exposed to an STD by both men while a camera caught all the depraved details, according to a court filing cited by WHNT.

‘The victim in this case was kept in Defendant’s home, without schooling or interaction with others outside the supervision on Defendant or his co-defendants, for eight months,’ said the filing.

Mr Herold, 32, also satisfied his perverted desires by taking the boy – his son – across state lines for criminal sexual purposes, according to the document.

The awful father faces federal charges for those actions, but they have not yet been brought against him.

Investigators have in their possession pictures of the evil torture the innocent boy suffered at the hands of the wicked men, they said.

The boy also told investigators of his suffering during a recent interview, according to the station.

‘They held the child captive for eight months and there are no standards, taboos or lines this defendant and his co-defendant hesitated to cross,’ Huntsville Police Department investigator Chad Smith testified in court Monday, according to WHNT.

Mr Herold was arrested last month and the boy placed into protective custody, according to AL.com. He faces two counts of sodomy, aggravated child abuse, three counts of sexual abuse of a child under 12-years-old and child pornography charges.

He is an IT consultant who worked from home.

The boy’s mother did not live with the men and appears to have not been part of his life, according to WAAY.

Mr Dunnavant was a loan officer until his arrest last month, according to WHNT. He faces charges of sexual torture, sodomy, aggravated child abuse and transmitting or exposing a person to a STD.

Authorities asked for the $1million bond for each man because they have not hesitated to leave the area in the past and have the means to flee.

‘He has the means of travel, family out-of-state and some of the allegations are there was much travel in the lives of Dunnavant and Herold,’ Mr Smith said in court.

The men are co-defendants. Authorities are still investigating to determine if others were involved. Mr Herold will be arraigned Tuesday.
