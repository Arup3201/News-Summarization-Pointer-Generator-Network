For more than two years Margot Woelk had to taste Hitler's food to ensure it was not poisoned.

She feasted on fresh fruit and vegetables including asparagus, peppers and peas, while her fellow Germans were being rationed.

Mrs Woelk, now 95, was one of a dozen women the Fuhrer used to protect himself at his Eastern front HQ known as the Wolf's Lair.

Eating: Hitler with his mistress Eva Braun. Every meal the dictator had was  tasted to make sure he was not poisoned

She was taken there in 1942 when she was evacuated  from Berlin to the East Prussian village of Gross Partsch - Parcz in modern-day Poland - after her flat was bombed.

Her husband had gone off to the fighting and her mother-in-law offered her a house in the countryside.

But the SS picked her up soon after she arrived and took her to meet the unwilling tasters.

Mrs Woelk told the Times: ''Of course I was afraid. If it [the food] had been poisoned I would not be here today. We were forced to eat it, we had no choice.

'Between 11 and 12 o'clock, we had to 
taste the food, and only after all 15 of us had tried it was it was 
driven to the headquarters by the SS.

'Hitler was so paranoid that the British would poison him - that's why he had 15 girls taste the food before he ate it himself,' said Margot. Above, Adolf the vegetarian with German officers in 1945

'It was all vegetarian, the most 
delicious fresh things, from asparagus to peppers and peas, served with 
rice, and salads. It was all arranged on one plate, just as it was 
served to him.'

She did not recall tasting any meat or fish and 
did not have to try out drinks.

There was always an hour's delay before Hitler tucked into his meal so that any effects of the food on the women could be seen.

Mrs Woelk had to report every day, but was only used when Hitler's personal train was in the station.

She lived with her mother-in-law outside the HQ until the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Hitler's life by Claus von Stauffenberg with a briefcase bomb in July 1944.

Feast: Hitler and his officers sit at a table laden with fresh fruit and vegetables before the war

From that moment she was confined to a school building and could only see her mother-in-law at weekends watched by the SS.

When Hitler abandoned the lair after 800 days in November 1944, a senior officer helped her escape back to Berlin by smuggling her on board Joseph Goebbels' train.

She believes the other tasters were shot by the advancing Russians.

In 1946 she was reunited with her husband who she had presumed dead. The couple lived together until he died in 1990.
