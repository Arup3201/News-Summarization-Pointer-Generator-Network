A former soldier who was injured by a Taliban explosive in Afghanistan has said he was refused entry to a pub because of scars on his face.

James Dalby, 23, was serving as a trooper in the Royal Dragoon Guards in 2010 when he was caught in the blast from an improvised explosive device.

The blast left him with third-degree burns, a broken leg, a fractured eye socket and shrapnel wounds to his head. The injuries were so serious he had to leave the Army for medical reasons.

Mr Dalby and a group of friends were turned away from a Yates's pub in York on a night out last Saturday - though Yates's has claimed it was for breaching their dress code.

The former soldier has described how he was singled out from his party and told he could not come in because his wound 'looks bad'.

He said: 'I got refused from Yates's for something I can't control. I was not drunk and I wasn't being disorderly, I wasn't giving him a reason to target anything.

'It would be nice to get a public apology and for people to be aware that it goes on. That was my job and it was not my call to make.

'To be refused for being an ex-serviceman with facial scars does anger me.'

Solidarity: Yates's has claimed that the group was denied entry for breaching a dress code, but Matt Rayner (pictured right with Mr Dalby) said he was dressed similarly to his friend and allowed inside

Locals in York have reacted angrily to his treatment and threatened to boycott Yates's in response. Hundreds of people have signed up to a protest in York planned for April 26.

Representatives of the pub chain, which has more than 60 locations across the country, said that the entire group was turned away because they failed to meet the dress code, which includes a weekend ban on hoodies and sportswear.

A spokesman claimed that Yates's welcomes service personnel and has given substantial amounts to forces charities.

Support: Hundreds of Facebook users voiced their anger, and have signed up to a protest in York later this month

But Mr Dalby and his friends have disputed that this was the reason, claiming that the doorman eventually admitted their clothes were not the real reason.

Matt Rayner, 25, was a member of the group and said: 'Everyone was disgusted by it. Of the group that was out, everyone was allowed in apart from James. He was not dressed any differently to me.

'James is a quiet lad and is not the most confident, something like this is going to knock his confidence. I just think it's wrong.'
