She's one of reality TV's most stylish exports so it was only a matter of time before Millie Mackintosh turned her hand to fashion design.

The former Made In Chelsea star's first fashion collection was such a hit that she's back with her spring/summer 15 drop - and it's full of bold floral patterns, hippy chic maxi dresses and the kind of festival fashion staples that she's made her signature.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new collection of suede dresses and tasseled jackets, the 25-year-old said: 'The range was inspired by my love of festivals and it has a real 70s influence.

'It's full of easy-to-wear shapes, feminine patterns and playful prints.'

Millie Mackintosh, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her spring/summer designs and models them all herself, of course 

Millie explains that this collection is totally different to her first and she took on board her customer and buyers' comments to help develop and enhance the brand.

'The whole process has been such an amazing learning experience and this is my favourite collection ever. I love the black suede jacket and print maxi dress, I am going to be getting a lot of wear out of the collection come summer,' she said.

Millie, who is 'gutted' that she can't attend Glastonbury because it clashes with two weddings she has on, will be rocking her designs at Coachella festival, as well as on her upcoming trips to Morocco and Istanbul.

You're also likely to catch her showbiz pals donning her designs - and she says seeing her friends such as Rosie Fortescue and Zara Martin wearing her collection is the 'ultimate compliment'.

Posing on location in Marrakesh in the new campaign imagery to promote her designs, Millie shows her fans how to work the looks - and she maintains it's all about letting your inner hippie out.

'When it comes to summer dressing, you've just got to have fun with it. My clothes are really accessible and you can dress them up or down depending on the occasion.'

As well as style expertise, Millie, who trained as a make-up artist before finding fame, is a beauty buff with her own eyelash range.

Sharing her top beauty tips for flawless summer skin, the star - a self-confessed sun worshiper - says SPF is essential.

'I loved sunbathing all my life and now I am so worried about sun damage so I always wear a tinted moisturiser with an SPF in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look.'

It's clear to see the 70s inspired this short suede dress which Millie rocked with a pair of snakeskin boots 

Aside from fashion and beauty, fitness is one of Millie's passions and she's a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches.

Whilst she's confident enough posting videos of her squatting, boxing and participating in the oh-so-fashionable but gruelling SBC class, there's one class Millie is afraid of trying.

'I really want to try this music video dance class at Frame studios but I am too embarrassed. I think it would be really fun and I probably need to learn to just let go of my inhibitions!'.

As well as cramming in fashion design and fitness classes, Millie is preparing to release her debut book at the end of the month.

If that wasn't enough, she's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year, is already working on her autumn/winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline.
