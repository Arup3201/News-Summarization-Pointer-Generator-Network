Leeds United are still on the hunt for a manager, but caretaker boss Neil Redfearn is staking his claim after beating Bournemouth to remain unbeaten in his three games in charge.

Massimo Cellino, the Leeds owner, has told Redfearn he is needed to manage in the academy but the 49-year-old followed up a win against Bolton and draw at Birmingham with a remarkable victory over Bournemouth.

Giuseppe Bellusci struck an unstoppable 25-yard free-kick in the 79th minute to put them ahead after goals from Andrew Surman and Souleymane Doukara had the scores level. Mirco Antenucci then ran through to finish the game off with Leeds’ third goal in the last minute.

Since David Hockaday was sacked after just 70 days in charge, former Leeds players, out-of-work managers and even a piece of computer coaching software have thrown their hat in the ring for the job. The latter may have just been a PR stunt but Redfearn is proving he knows what he is doing.

Bournemouth were in complete control in the first half, before and after taking an early lead.

It took until only the sixth minute for them open the scoring when midfielder Surman curled a sumptuous effort into the bottom left corner.

And had it not been for Marco Silvestri in the Leeds goal, the home side would have streaked ahead. He was sharp from the off, diving to push wide Ryan Fraser’s fierce left-foot shot which was heading for the top right corner on three minutes. Matt Ritchie, on the right of Bournemouth’s midfield, then tested him twice in four minutes but the Italian was equal to the task on both occasions.

Bournemouth really should have made their first-half dominance count and were punished when Leeds equalised on 67 minutes.

Doukara managed to measure his run to stay onside before slotting the ball into the bottom left corner for his first league goal since moving from Serie A side Catania in the summer.

Two minutes later Leeds broke through again but this time time Billy Sharp shot wide.

They still had to rely on their goalkeeper for more heroics to keep them in the game before their late flourish sealed what had seemed an unlikely win.
