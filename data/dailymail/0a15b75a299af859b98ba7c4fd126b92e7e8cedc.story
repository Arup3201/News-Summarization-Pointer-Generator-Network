The teenager, who has not been named, made a number of nuisance calls to Wiltshire Police from telephone boxes, claiming a non-existent fight was in progress

The time-wasting teen was invited to attend Calne police station, Wiltshire where she admitted making hoax calls on November 16 and November 24 after seeing the images of herself online. 

During her visit with her mother, she met PCSO Mark Cook who attended the scene when she reported the 'fight'.

She was let off without further punishment because of her age, but was told she had to write a letter of apology to everyone she had caused disruption to which had to cover at least a full side of A4.

Once the letter was approved she was told to attend the Crime and Communications Centre at Wiltshire Police HQ in Devizes to read her apology to a 999 call handler supervisor.

During the meeting the supervisor explained the impact and dangers of hoax calls, and discussed with her the severity of her actions.

The girl, who attended the police headquarters with her mother, was told to write an apology, which had to cover one side of A4, which she was then invited to read to the 999 call handler supervisor
