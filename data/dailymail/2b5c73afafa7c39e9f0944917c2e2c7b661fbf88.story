Two English Defence League leaders were arrested today as they planed to visit the spot where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed last month.

EDL leader Tommy Robinson and his co-leader Kevin Carroll were detained by police on suspicion of obstructing officers in east London as they planned to stage what they claimed was a charity walk to Woolwich Barracks via the East London Mosque.

The Metropolitan Police yesterday put conditions on the march and imposed a route between Hyde Park Corner and Old Palace Yard, opposite the House of Lords.

In a statement posted on the EDL’s Twitter feed, the group said: 'Tommy Robinson & Kev Caroll arrested for obstructing the police and carted off.'

Scotland Yard yesterday said it was imposing conditions due to fears that both the march and gathering would 'result in serious public disorder and serious disruption to the life of the community' and a breach of the conditions would be a criminal offence.

The police force issued two notices under the Public Order Act based on 'current community tensions, the current intelligence picture about Saturday and recent marches and protests held by similar groups'.

It also said that attempts had been made to liaise with the EDL to facilitate the march and gathering and offered them two alternative routes that avoided Tower Hamlets, home to the East London Mosque.

Alan Green, chairman of the Tower Hamlets Inter Faith Forum, said that an open day was taking place at the mosque today.

He
 said: 'We are aware that there are those who are fearful of Islam and 
who seek to undermine the harmony that exists between the faith 
communities in this borough. Our unity here today makes it very clear 
that they will not succeed.'

Earlier this week, two American political activists who founded an anti-Muslim group were banned by the Home Secretary from entering the UK following reports they were to attend this weekend’s march.

Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who set up Stop Islamisation of America and run the website Jihad Watch, have been forbidden from entering the country on the grounds their presence would 'not be conducive to the public good'.

The police also banned the British National Party (BNP) from marching from Woolwich Barracks earlier this month and ordered it to move its protest to Westminster.

The event saw rival protesters clash outside the Houses of Parliament, as BNP supporters and anti-fascist campaigners came to blows.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At approximately 11.25am today, two men were arrested outside Aldgate East station for obstructing police. They have been taken to a south London police station.

'Two further men were arrested on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to an east London police station.'
