Never-before-seen nude photos from 1995 of Dancing with the Stars host Brooke Burke, 43, have surfaced in a New York City art show.

The Route 66-themed Andre Plessel photos appeared Thursday in the Lilac Gallery in Manhattan and show the swimsuit model topless in the Western sun.

Originally snapped for a German auto parts catalog, the pictures initially caused a stir with Burke's legal team, according to Page Six.

Just sittin' on a tire: The photos were originally taken for a German auto parts catalog but were never used for that purpose

Their source says Burke's people called up the gallery just before opening night in an attempt to hunt down the photographer.

'They wanted to see the original releases Brooke signed to do this shoot,' claimed the Page Six source. 

The source would clarify that it was just a matter of updating files, since the buxom emcee's star power has rocketed since the shoot and her legal team wasn't with her back in 1995.

The legal team reportedly said they take 'no issue' with the content of the photos.

The show is called Andre Plessel: Visions and in addition to Burke features models Karolina Kurkova, Adriana Lima and Laetitia Casta. 

It runs through November 6. 

Burke has two children with her Baywatch star husband David Charvet: a daughter named Heaven Rain Charvet and a son Shaya Braven Charvet.
