When most people have too much to drink, they will often 'sleep it off' in an attempt to sober up.

A Florida man, however, is not like most people - when he was stopped for speeding last month, he told the arresting officer that his wife had been nagging him for drinking too much, so he decided to hop in his SUV and 'drive it off' - on his way to a bar to have more drinks.

Michael Moore, 61, was stopped just after midnight on February 13 by an officer in Stuart Florida after he was seen speeding down U.S. 1.

Moore was stopped in the 800 block of Southwest U.S. 1 at about 12:35 a.m. and the officer immediately smelled alcohol when he approached the allegedly intoxicated motorist, according to court records first obtained by TCPalm.com.

According to the probable cause statement, Moore told the officer that he was coming from his house and that he had consumed 'a couple' of drinks.

He also told the officer that he was heading to a local bar to have 'a few' more.

The officer noted in the report that Moore's eyes were glassy and that his speech was slurred - according to the officer, he sounded 'thick-tongued.'

Legal limit: Court records show that Moore's blood alcohol content was 0.104. The legal limit in Florida is 0.08

Moore explained to the officer that he had been in an argument with his wife and decided he would take a drive.

'He also told me that his wife told him that he (had) been drinking too 
much so he decided to go out and 'drive it off,"' an arrest affidavit 
states.

Prior to his arrest, Moore was given standard field sobriety tests. He failed them all.

Once in custody, officers administered a breath test to determine Moore's blood alcohol content. Two separate tests measured his BAC at 0.104 and 0.103. The legal limit in Florida is 0.08.

Moore was placed under arrest and charged with driving under the influence.
