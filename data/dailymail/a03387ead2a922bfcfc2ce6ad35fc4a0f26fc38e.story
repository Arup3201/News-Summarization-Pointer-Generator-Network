The cremated remains of an Ohio woman that were supposed to be delivered to her husband didn't arrive as scheduled or in time for her funeral, and now the U.S. Postal Service is trying to figure out what happened to the package.

Eighty-year-old Barbara Kirkendall died on November 5 at a Cleveland hospital, apparently because of a blood infection, and her remains were sent to her Columbus-area home after the autopsy and cremation, The Columbus Dispatch reported.

Norman Kirkendall was supposed to receive his wife's ashes by noon Saturday under a money-back, Priority Mail Express 1-Day guarantee.

Long marriage: Norman Kirkendall was married to his wife Barbara for 61 years and is pictured here at their anniversary last month before her untimely death earlier this month 

Young loves: 'I feel like I've lost her,' Norman (left)  said of his wife Barbara (right) of 61 years, whom he met at an Air Force base in Mississippi when he was an instructor and she was among his students

He told the newspaper he waited for hours, but the package never showed up.

'I was up at 5 o’clock in the morning, just waiting,' Norman Kirkendall said.

'I feel like I've lost her,' he said of his wife of 61 years, whom he met at an Air Force base in Mississippi when he was an instructor and she was among his students.

Her remains had been shipped to Columbus and signed out for local delivery, the newspaper reported. 

What happened after that is a mystery.

A Postal Service spokesman, David Van Allen, said a 'vigilant search' is being conducted.

The Kirkendall family attended a memorial service Thursday without the remains, but her husband said the planned military burial in Dayton is postponed until the ashes are found.

True love: Norman Kirkendall is heartbroken after losing his wife and not holding on to her remains is making her death even more difficult to process

Movie star grace: Norman Kirkendall said he couldn't help but fall in love when he first saw Barbara and how he likened her beautiful brunette features to that of a classic movie star 

Kirkendall told the Columbus Dispatch that he can't sleep and that his heart feels as though it is going to beat out of his chest.

Kirkendall knew soon after meeting the brown-haired petite beauty he described as 'looking like a movie star,' that he was going to marry her.

The couple shared their 61st wedding anniversary last month and had five children together, one of them was named after Barbara.

Kirkendall said his wife told him that she wanted an autopsy after she died for scientific purposes to help other people.

'If she could save someone else’s life, she would want that,' he said.

Kirkendall, heartbroken, is begging the post to find his wife's remains.

'Somebody,' he said, 'needs to do something.'

'I am just torn up inside,' Kirkendall told ABC. 

 Barbara's children said that their mother's missing remains is just adding to their grief. This is the only package all year they've ever had get lost in the mail.
