The Idaho National Guard has joined firefighters battling wildfires raging across the state, which have forced the evacuation of 400 homes and burned over 100 square miles in the past two weeks.

Hot, dry windy weather throughout the West, has caused fire season to start early this year and forecasters have warned that these conditions are set to continue.

One blaze, which started when a utility vehicle caught fire, is now just four miles from the resort town of Featherville, in mountains around 100 miles northeast of Boise.

Nearly 1,000 firefighters have gathered there for a last-ditch effort to keep the flames at bay but many resident have already fled.

An estimated 1,000 people in the town and nearby Pine are braced for mandatory evacuation orders and Idaho Gov. C.L. 'Butch' Otter already has issued a disaster declaration.

Efforts are being concentrated on building fire breaks, clearing brush from around houses and other structures and setting up sprinkler systems, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Arnold Hartigan said.

Authorities reopened roads to incoming traffic for about 12 hours overnight to allow residents who had fled to return long enough to collect their belongings.

'We're trying to allow as many people as possible to preserve their memories by gathering up family photographs and other mementos and keep hold of those parts of their lives,' Elmore County Sheriff's Office spokesman Gary Walker said.

Pat Christensen, co-owner of Cyndie's Featherville Cafe, said he and his wife intended to stay put for the time being to keep their lunch counter going.

'We're still open for business," he said, adding that he thought measures taken by fire crews were keeping them safe.'

In the eastern part of the state, a group of fires that burned more than 114 square miles finally slowed after it blazed through stands of timber killed by bark beetles. The fires were moving northeast, within three miles of the Montana border.

So far this season, wildfires have consumed about 6.3 million acres across the country, over 1 million acres more than the 10-year average for this time of year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise.

According to Jennifer Smith, of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, not only are more wildfires flaring up in the West this year than last, but the nation's fires have gotten bigger.

In California, a dozen major blazes up and down the state were keeping more than 9,000 firefighters busy, with the greatest immediate danger facing the rural community of Ranchita, about 50 miles northeast of San Diego.

All 180 homes there were evacuated as

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Captain Mike Mohler said.

Hundreds
of miles away in Northern California, a fire that blackened 43,000 
acres near the town of Belden in the Plumas National Forest was 
threatening 900 homes, prompting some evacuations.

Another
lightning-caused fire has devoured nearly 80,000 acres of forest along 
the California-Oregon border, prompting the evacuation of nearly 70 
homes. But firefighters have managed to encircle about a third of the 
blaze.

One of the more 
destructive fires in recent weeks flared into its fourth day near the 
town of Cle Elum in northwestern Washington state. Authorities reported 
that 70-plus homes and more than 200 barns and other structures were 
charred this week.

More than
400 homes have been evacuated in the area, but firefighters managed to 
carve containment lines around 25 percent of the blaze's perimeter by 
Wednesday night, with full containment expected within a week, 
authorities said.

The 
Washington state blaze has scorched nearly 23,000 acres of rolling hills
along the eastern edge of the Cascade Mountains. Two firefighters 
suffered minor injuries on Wednesday.

By
far the largest current wildfire in the West, the Holloway Fire has 
blackened well over 430,000 acres since it was ignited by lightning in 
Nevada on August 5 and burned into southern Oregon two days later.

Fire authorities said the blaze was now more than 70 percent contained.

The
ominous weather forecasts were cited by Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who
on Thursday declared a statewide state of emergency that authorizes use
of National Guard helicopters to fight wildland blazes.

He noted that much of his state was in extreme fire danger, the imminent threat of wildfire and mentioned a 123-square-mile blaze in southern Oregon.

In Northern California, crews made progress along the northern edge of a fire that has burned 67 square miles in the Plumas National Forest. The blaze has threatened more than 900 homes and prompted voluntary evacuations.

It was among the largest of nearly a dozen major wildfires burning across California that kept more than 9,000 firefighters busy.

Crews moved closer to containing several Southern California wildfires, but dozens of rural homes remained threatened as thunderstorms loomed.

In northern San Diego County, a cluster of lightning-sparked fires kept residents from more than 100 homes in Ranchita and San Felipe.

About 30 miles to the northwest, a blaze in Riverside County neared containment. That fire destroyed four structures, injured six people, and burned more than 4 square miles east of Temecula.

Higher humidity helped at a huge wildfire burning on both sides of the Nevada-Oregon state line. The lightning-sparked blaze has burned 722 square miles of sagebrush
