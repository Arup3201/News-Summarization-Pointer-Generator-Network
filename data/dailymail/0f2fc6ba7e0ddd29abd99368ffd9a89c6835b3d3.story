For more than two years her greatest pleasure in life has been feeding the birds in the garden.

Pensioner Frances Cheatham watches every morning with binoculars from her kitchen window as they tuck in to the seeds and nuts she puts out for them.

Most days the 71-year-old former driving instructor also enjoys listening to the birdsong that echoes around the communal grounds and sheltered accommodation she shares with other residents. 

Heartbroken: Frances Cheatham, 71, has been banned from feeding the birds in the garden of Leyfield Court in Chester, because the housing association said they were 'health hazards'

But the kind-hearted Bird Lady has found herself in a showdown with her neighbours and authorities – after being ordered to stop.

An investigation involving police, an environmental health specialist and housing trust officials highlighted potential ‘health hazards’ and concluded she risked spreading disease. She was then called to a housing trust meeting attended by a police officer to discuss the bird feeding and neighbour complaints.

Yesterday Miss Cheatham accused officials of ‘bullying’ tactics and refused to take down her hanging feeders at Leyfield Court in Lache, Cheshire, which is run by the Chester and District Housing Trust.

She told the Daily Mail it was a ‘harmless pastime’ that had given her years of enjoyment – and pledged she would stand her ground. 

She added: ‘I’ve got about five feeders on the go. I take good care of them and spend lots of happy times feeding the birds. So I couldn’t believe it when I got this letter telling me to stop doing it, and inviting me to a meeting.

‘I found out that one of the housing officers even phoned my brother – I think they wanted to find out if I had any mental issues. Well, I haven’t got any mental issues – I just love birds. I feel I’m being persecuted for doing something that millions of people do every day.’

Miss Cheatham, a divorcee, conceded there had been long-running hostility after a neighbour objected to and removed two bird tables she had installed. Since then she has set up hanging feeders in the garden, which she claims hardly anyone else ventures into. 

Miss Cheatham accused officials of 'bullying' tactics claiming that it was 'a harmless past time' 

 

Stunned: The pensioner, who lives alone in the retirement flats, received a letter from Chester & District Housing Trust (CDHT) saying she was 'spreading disease'

RSPB spokesman Chris Collett said: ‘As long as people practise good hygiene with their feeders, there shouldn’t be a problem. It’s a very positive thing to do.’ A spokesman for the housing trust’s parent company, Sanctuary, said police were at the meeting because of ‘wider issues’ arising from neighbours’ allegations and complaints about other matters.

Sanctuary executive Christa Ripley said in a statement there had been ‘numerous’ complaints about the feathers, droppings, dust and seeds in the communal garden.

‘We fully appreciate that she enjoys her time feeding birds, but using the communal area to do so is causing a disruption to other residents, which we need to consider.’

'Only enjoyment': Mrs Cheatham has been feeding the birds with her own money. She says one of her 'few pleasures' in life has now been taken away from her
