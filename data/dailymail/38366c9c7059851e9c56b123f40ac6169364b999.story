Tottenham striker Harry Kane is happy with his current goal haul but hopes to continue his fine scoring form with chances in the Premier League.

The 21-year-old scored his seventh of the campaign as Spurs beat Championship side Brighton in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday.

Kane, who is outscoring fellow Spurs strikers Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado, still hasn't been handed a Premier League start by Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, despite his form.

'I'm always happy to be scoring and getting those goals inside the box, those strikers' goals, is always good,' Kane told Spurs TV.

'It (the number of goals) is a good return but I'm concentrating on the next game now and hopefully I will get some minutes and get some goals.

'These are the sort of games I want to be scoring in and getting myself out there, I always enjoy playing - I just want to keep playing and keep scoring.'

Pochettino insisted after the Brighton game that Kane, who scored a Europa League hat-trick last week, will have to continue to be patient.

'He shares with another striker like Adebayor or Soldado the minutes in the official games,' said Pochettino.

'We need to understand that we are in different competitions. You demand me to play Harry Kane in every game - he played today. Soldado and Harry Kane are different players. We are in a lot of competitions.'
