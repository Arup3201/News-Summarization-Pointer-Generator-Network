It’s a measure of how well Luis Suarez has played in his first five games for Barcelona that he is yet to score and there is not so much as a murmur of discontent from supporters towards the £65m striker.

Marca dubbed him ‘El Generoso’ after he came off the bench at half time to set up both goals in a 2-1 comeback against Almeria recently and he has earned the ‘Generous One’ nickname with four assists in four league appearances.

This is not the first time goals have been hard to come by at a new club. When he finally made it into the first-team of his boyhood club Nacional in Uruguay he struggled to find the back of the net. 

Luis Suarez has yet score for Barcelona since his £$65million move from Liverpool during the summer

In his autobiography Crossing the Line released last month he recalls: “At first, I missed chances. Lots and lots of them. It reached the point where people insulted me and whistled me. They called me burro meaning ‘donkey’. Even now I meet people who say to me: "I used to insult you, I used to shout at you, I was one of those people who thought you were never going to score any goals".' 

But at Barcelona there’s no such abuse from supporters because it’s not so much a case of missing chances as not having had them yet. His only clear-cut chance so far came against old club Ajax on an emotional night in the Amsterdam Arena when his shot was parried by the keeper after he ran on to a Lionel Messi pass.

But for the most part the golden shoe has become the silver platter serving up goal scoring opportunities on a plate for team-mates. He set-up Neymar to score after only four minutes of his debut at the Santiago Bernabeu and then played Messi in to score what would have been the second only for the Argentine to see his shot saved by Iker Casillas.

Suarez has struck up a great relationship, on and off the field, with Barca superstar Lionel Messi (right)

Messi, now La Liga top score of all all time, is Barca's most prolific marksman with Suarez providing support  

As well as the two assists in one half in that game against Almeria he created Barcelona’s third goal in their 5-1 win over Sevilla on Saturday with a run and cross for Ivan Rakitic to head in.

Critics, and there are currently none among Barcelona supporters, will say he was signed to score goals but Messi scores the majority of Barcelona’s goals and has been doing so ever since Pep Guardiola converted him to a centre-forward in 2009.

In that 2009-10 campaign he got 34 goals; 31 came in the following season; in 2011-12 he scored 50, he got 46 in 12-13 and last season he reached 28 league goals despite taking a month off mid-season.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic could not adapt to playing alongside Messi and left Barcelona after just one season.

The two have struck up a good relationship off and on the field – both partial to the Maté herbal drink so traditional in Argentina and Uruguay – and both sharing a joke on Monday when the draw for next year’s Copa America pitted the two countries together in the same group although Suarez’ on-going international ban will prevent him from playing.

Rather than take Messi’s top marksman’s job at Barcelona, the team needed Suarez to give them back the high-pressing intensity that has been lost in the last couple of seasons. He has been able to do that and the quality of some of his assists from his new position on the right of the front three have more than made up for the lack of goals so far.

Even when he does start scoring recent history suggests it is unlikely the goals will come in the same quantities as at Liverpool. He will not be the first player to have been a record goalscorer elsewhere whose goal count drops at Barcelona.

On top of all his achievements at club level, Suarez is top scorer in the history of the Uruguay national team

Neymar got 14 goals in 17 league games in his last year at Santos but only nine in 25 in his first season with Barcelona. Spain’s all-time top scorer David Villa fared the same. He scored 107 goals in 166 league games for Valencia but when he moved to Barcelona he netted only 33 in 77 matches. Thierry Henry’s goals return also dropped once he had left Arsenal to play alongside Messi.

Suarez has adapted his game just as Henry and Villa did. Playing to the right of Messi there is licence to switch to a more central position but the change is usually initiated by the Argentine. Those who cannot or will not adapt to playing alongside Messi tend to leave the club with Zlatan Ibrahimovic doing so after just one season.

Suarez might have broken his duck at the weekend but before the ball could reach him at the far post Messi had darted in ahead of him to send it over the line. It was the goal that saw Messi break the all-time league record and Suarez found himself congratulating a team-mate again, instead of taking the plaudits himself.

Suarez, in action against Stoke for Liverpool, was top-assist provider in last seasons Premier League

Having scored over 100 times for Ajax, becoming the top scorer in the history of the Uruguay national team and, along with Cristiano Ronaldo, getting more league goals than any other player in Europe last season, it is no wonder his coach Luis Enrique says: 'I don’t think anyone doubts that Luis Suarez is going to score a lot of goals for Barcelona.' 

Suarez was top-assist provider last season in the Premier League and he is capable of repeating that in Spain. But he will not want to finish too far down the goal charts in his first season and Tuesday night, against Apoel, who are bottom of Group F with only one point, might be the perfect time to get started.

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is in no doubt that Suarez will start scoring goals at the Nou Camp very soon
