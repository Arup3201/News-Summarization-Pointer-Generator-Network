If Arsenal's latest promotional video is anything to go by, the Gunners can't wait to practice their American accents during their pre-season trip to New York.

Ahead of their pre-season friendly against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday, several Arsenal stars stepped up to give their best attempts at the famous accent of the American city's inhabitants.

Karl Jenkinson, Serge Gnabry, Mathieu Flamini and Kieran Gibbs attempted phrases such as 'How you doing?' to differing degrees of success.

Hidden talent? Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs does his best New York accent

Former AC Milan midfielder Flamini seems to really struggle with the accent as he smiles and proclaims, 'Hey, I'm walking here' before Jenkinson and Gibbs give famous saying from cult film Taxi Driver, 'Are you talking to me?' 

At least the Gunners keep their sense of humour as they happily admit 'We don't do accents, we do football.'

Arsene 
Wenger's side will play in New York on Saturday night before taking part
 in the Emirates Cup where they will play Benfica and Monaco ahead of 
their Community Shield clash against Manchester City.

All smiles: Gunners midfielder Mathieu Flamini seemed to enjoy being an American for a couple of minutes

The four Arsenal players impressed took on the following famous New york phrases:

'How you doing?'

'Are you talking to me?

'Hey, I'm walking here'

'Forget about it'

'Do you want to buy a coffee?'

Arsenal enjoyed a comfortable start to their pre-season campaign on Saturday as they eased to a 2-0 win at Borehamwood.

Aaron
 Ramsey started for the Gunners alongside Jenkinson, Nacho Monreal and 
Wojciech Szczesny but it wasn't until the 68th minute that Kristoffer 
Olson gave the FA Cup winners the lead.

Benik Afobe then made sure of the victory with a penalty late on.
