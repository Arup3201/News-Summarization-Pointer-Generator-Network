Voted off by the judges despite ending up third in the leaderboard with debut performance, with TV presenter Chegwin at the bottom

An embarrassed Pamela Anderson was voted off Dancing On Ice on Sunday night after suffering a wardrobe malfunction.

The Baywatch star was put off her stride during her dance-off with partner Matt Evers after her tight dress failed to contain her ample cleavage.

Her stumble as she tried to amend her neckline meant the judges decide to save Keith Chegwin and Olga Sharutenko after the couples ended up in bottom two.

Wardrobe malfunction: Pamela struggled to stay in her dress during the skate-off

Although she had performed strongly in 
her first dance earlier on Sunday evening, her second dance was ruined by her dress issue.

Fortunately for Pamela, the wardrobe team was prepared and she was wearing matching white and silver nipple covers to protect her modesty when her right breast started to escape from the tight dress.

Pamela's exit was a shock to bookmakers Ladbrokes, who had given her 20/1 odds to be first voted out.

Although she was in the top half of 
the leaderboard and Chegwin was at the bottom, her luck didn't translate
 to her second dance.

Graceful: Pamela had shown promise as a skater, but her mistake during the skate-off cost her a place in the next episode

For
 the skate-off, Pamela performed another slow number to Sinead 
O'Connor's cover of Sacrifice, following her earlier skate to Emeli 
Sande's Read All About It.

After
 the dance, Pamela admitted she had struggled with her dress, with host 
Philip Schofield joking: 'If that happened earlier, you wouldn't be in 
the skate-off.'

TV 
presenter Chegwin, who was forced to quit last year's show after 
breaking his ribs, performed a new dance to O Fortuna after his earlier 
skate to D:ream's Things Can Only Get Better.

Lacking support: Pamela looked uncomfortable in her tiny dress during the performance

Following the skate-off, it was up to the judges to decide their fate.

Karen Barber said: 'I'd like to save you both, but the best performance that time was Keith.'

Ashley Roberts agreed: 'Because of the stumbles I'm saving Keith.'

Sad: Pamela didn't feel too confident about her chances after stumbling during the routine

Serious stuff: Keith Chegwin and Olga Sharutenko performed a dramatic sequence to O Fortuna

Jason Gardiner's third vote for Pamela meant head judge Robin Cousins' vote was essentially redundant: 'I'm saving Keith.'

Pamela remained philosophical about 
it and apologised to her partner: 'Sad, it was really fun and now I know
 how to skate a little bit. I feel so sad, sorry Matt, I stumbled, I 
fell, my boobs fell out.'

Following their first performances earlier that evening, all the celebrity contestants had brand new dances ready for a potential skate-off.

Shayne
 Ward and Maria Fillipov were the first to find out they had survived 
another week, followed by Beth Tweddle and Dan Whiston.

Tension: Matt, Pamela, Keith and Olga wait for the judges to decide their fate

Shock: Samia Ghadie and Beth Tweedle react after hearing Pamela is voted off

Matt
 Lapinskas and Brianne Delcourt were ecstatic to find out they were 
through, followed by Samia Ghadie and Sylvain Longchambon.

Week one saw only half of the 12 celebrity contestants taking to the ice.

Lauren
 Goodger, Oona King, Gareth Thomas, Joe Pasquale, Anthea Turner and Luke
 Campbell and their partners will all skate for the first time next 
Sunday.

Sunday's
 live show marked the return of former judges Jason and Karen to the 
panel, as well the debut of former Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, who 
spent years as a trained dancer before joining the girl group.
