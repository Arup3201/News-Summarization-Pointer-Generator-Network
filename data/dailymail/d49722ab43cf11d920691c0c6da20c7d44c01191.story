One of the tallest former stars of the NBA basketball league has told Chinese people they need to get fit - as it's revealed their height is lagging behind neighbouring countries.

Towering over the crowds at the Great Hall of the People today, 7ft 6in-tall Yao Ming said not enough Chinese people exercised - which can be related to height.

He said: 'Nowadays, [there is] no more long-distance running, no more strenuous exercise for students.

You won't get lost in that crowd! Former NBA basketball player Yao Ming (C), who is a delegate of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), towers over 
the crowd as he arrives at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today

Giant: Mr Ming (C) stops to talk to reporters waiting outside the 
conference, where he shared his views on declining health and the 
selling of ivory. His comments come as it's revealed that Chinese people are shorter on average than those in Japan and Korea

'No one dares to take the responsibility. It becomes a vicious spiral later. The less you exercise, the worse your physical health will be.'

Yao, a former player for Houston Rockets, was speaking as a delegate at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference annual session in The Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

He backed
 Wu Zhengxian, a lawmaker and a director at the Beijing Institute of 
Education, who told the meeting that Chinese boys from seven to 17 are '2.54cm shorter than Japanese in the same age range.'

She said: '[In global rankings], Chinese men rank 
32nd with an average height of 1.697 metres â€“ shorter than Japanese 
males at 29th with 1.707 metres and Koreans who rank 18th at 1.74 
metres.'

The event hosts the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a debating chamber that began on 
Monday, and the National People's Congress (NPC).

Pensive: The former NBA star is deep in thought as he attends the conferences this week

As one of the biggest events of the political calendar, it is a chance to catch China's most senior political figures in public.

But it is also a chance to see the host of celebrities who come out in force to sit as members of the CPPCC for the Communist Party.

As well as Yao, film star Jackie Chan and Olympic hurdler Liu Xiang are members.

Yao also delivered a petition at the conference, calling on China's government to ban sales of ivory.

After
 retiring from basketball in 
2011, Yao - who was one of the tallest players in the US basketball 
league - has used his public status to influence politics and push his 
causes.

He is well known for his stance against poaching and his high-profile campaigns against the trade.

Star struck: The conference sees a host of celebrities descend on Beijing, one of which is Yao Ming

Yaoâ€™s proposal to the CPPCC asks for a total ban on all domestic trade in ivory and ivory products and an end to imports.

China banned trading in endangered 
species such as the giant panda, the golden monkey and the white-flag 
dolphin in the late 1980s.
