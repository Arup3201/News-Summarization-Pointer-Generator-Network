Physicist Paul Frampton is currently serving time in Bueno Aires after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine into the country

A brilliant physicist currently languishing under house arrest in Buenos Aries after being found guilty of smuggling two kilos of cocaine into the country has admitted his large ego played a key role in his tragic fall from grace.

Paul Frampton, a distinguished professor of physics and astronomy, has spent most of the past 30 years as a professor at the University of North Carolina.

But British-born Frampton’s life took a unexpected turn in November 2011 when he started an online relationship with someone he thought was Denise Milani, a Czech model and former Miss Bikini World.

After meeting via an online dating 
site and despite never having ever spoken to her, Frampton, 68, became 
convinced that they would marry and start a family.

The
 unlikely scenario of a glamorous model falling for an aging academic 
clearly has all the hallmarks of a honey trap, but to a lonely old man 
who had got divorced three years earlier the relationship seemed very 
real to Frampton.

Academic
 friends warned Frampton about what he was getting into, but as the 
professor himself admits he rarely pays attention to the opinions of 
others.

‘He told me to look her up on the internet,’ his old friend John Dixon told The New York Times.

‘I thought he was out of his mind, and I told
 him that. "You’re not talking to the real girl. Why would a young woman
 like that be interested in an old guy like you?” But he really believed
 that he had a pretty young woman who wanted to marry him.’

When The New York Times asked 
Frampton what made him think that Milani was interested, he replied, 
‘Well, I have been accused of having a huge ego.’

Friends say Frampton was extremely inexperienced with women and could therefore have been easily duped by whoever was posing as Milani.

He was already 50 when he married his wife Anne-Marie Frampton. The pair divorced in 2008 and remain friends, she has described him as a very good scientist, but with the emotional age of a 3-year-old.

As Frampton's online relationship with Milani blossomed, she invited him to finally meet her in La Paz, Bolivia, where she was doing a photo shoot.

When Frampton arrived in La Paz he was greeted with a message that his supposed girlfriend had had to leave for another photo shoot in Brussels, but she promised to send him a ticket.

The couple keep regular online contact and eventually a ticket arrived to take him to Buenos Aires, with the promise that a ticket to Brussels would follow.

Milani simply asked one favor of Frampton – that he bring her bag which she had mistakenly left in La Paz.

Despite the mounting evidence that he was being set up as the victim of some scam, Frampton agreed to her request and once again refused to listen to the advice of his friends.

While still in Bolivia, Frampton exchanged messages with his old friend John Dixon.

‘I said: “Well, inside that suitcase sewn into the lining will be cocaine. You’re in big trouble,” said Dixon recalling their conversation.

Nine days after he arrived in Bolivia, Frampton met with a man who handed over Milani’s bag.

Frampton had been expecting a designer label and was so surprised by the non-descript black suitcase with wheels he was handed instead.

He was even more surprised to find that it was also empty. He wrote to Milani, but she quickly wrote back that it had great ‘sentimental value’ to her.

The next day Frampton flew from La Paz to Buenos Aires, where he waited for another two days for his ticket to Europe to arrive.

With no sign of a ticket to Europe and after being away from home for 15 days, Frampton decided it was time to return to North Carolina.

But rather than leave the bag behind, he decided to take it with him. That way, he reasoned, Milani could come and collect it from him.

Then just as his friends had warned, Frampton was arrested when he checked the bag in at the airport and he was charged with transporting two kilos of cocaine into the country.

Frampton spent almost a year at the Devoto prison sharing a large room with 40 other men accused of drug-related offenses

The professor was taken to Devoto, a dilapidated old prison where he was forced to share one large room with 80 other men accused of drug dealing or smuggling.

Frampton admits it was a month into his prison stay before his fellow prisoners managed to convince him that the woman he thought he’d been in touch with all this time had probably been a man impersonating her.

Throughout his 282 day stay in the prison, Frampton maintained that he was the victim of a scam.

Three weeks before his trial and with the help of privately hired lawyers, Frampton was able to quickly secure his release on the proviso that he remained under house arrest at the Buenos Aires home of his friend Richard Czerniawski.

At the trial the strategy of his defense team was to present Frampton as a brilliant man out of touch with day-to-day life. They claimed he suffered from 'a schizoid personality disorder that prevents him from 
making normal social connections and renders him unusually gullible.'

They called in a psychologist, who pronounced him unusually gullible without, however, diagnosing a mental illness. The judges sent their own doctor, who declared Frampton normal. 

Frampton was arrested at Ezeiza international airport in Buenos Aires

A total of three psychological evaluations were presented at the trial, and two agreed that he had the traits of a narcissistic personality - an overblown and unrealistic image of himself.

Prior to the trial Frampton had maintained that his text message exchanges with the person he thought was Milani would prove his innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt.

But that defense quickly unraveled. The prosecutor opened his cross-examination of Frampton by citing a text message retrieved from Frampton’s confiscated cellphone.

‘On Jan. 22 at 9:46 a.m.,’ he said, ‘you wrote from Ezeiza airport to the person you understood to be Denise Milani: “Was worried only about sniffer dogs but more.’”

Other text exchanges also seemed to show Frampton had known more than he been letting on.

One at 9:52 a.m. read: ‘Need to know if your loyalty is with the bad guy-agent & bolivian friends - or good guy, your husband?’

At 12:16 p.m., he wrote: 'WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? AT THIS LAST MOMENT. WE DID NOT DECIDE HOW TO MEET TOMORROW IN BRUSSELS AND KEEP COCA & LIVES. AT SIRU (the hotel in Brussels where they were due to meet) WE MAY LOSE BOTH!!'

Denise Milani had her identity stolen and used as the honey trap for Frampton

Frampton tried to explain to the judges that these messages – some 30 of them - were actually jokes.

But perhaps they were the work of a fantasist living out a supposed alternative reality with a girlfriend who by ow even he by must have questioned the existence off?

Even more oddly, his defense showed CC-TV footage which showed Frampton getting up from a cafe table and wandering off, leaving his bags unattended for up to 25 minutes at a time. Hardly the behavior of a drug smuggler.

The prosecution then produced a piece of paper on which Frampton had written: ‘1 gram 200 dollars 2,000 grams 400,000 dollars.’

Although his defense claimed this had been written after he was arrested and Frampton simply enjoyed making random calculations.

Frampton said: 'My mind works in a strange way.'

Ultimately the judges sentenced him to four years eights months for drug smuggling on Nov. 19, although he is permitted to serve the remainder of sentence under house arrest in Buenos Aires.

With credit for the time he has already spent in custody, Frampton is expected to be released in May 2014.

Frampton maintains his innocence, but the truth of this bizarre set of circumstances may never be fully explained.

The real Denise Milani was never accused of having a role in the drug smuggling and has no connection to Frampton.

She told the Mail on Sunday that she feels sorry for Frampton. 'I have a lot of 
sympathy for him, though I have to wonder how he could have been so 
naive,' she said.

He too says he has sympathy for her, but Frampton also has his own worries, in particular related to his finances.

His university have kept his position open awaiting the outcome of an appeal he has launched. In the meantime he isn't being paid and friends have setup a website to help raise money for him and publicize his unusual experience.
