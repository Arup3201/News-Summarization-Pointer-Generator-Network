The oil price fell to a five-year low yesterday amid fresh worries about the outlook for the global economy.

Crude tumbled to as low as $67.53 a barrel – the cheapest it has been since October 2009 – before rebounding back to around $70.

The price of oil has now fallen around 40 per cent since topping $115 a barrel in June.

The slump in oil price is good news for motorists and airlines but a disaster for the likes of Vladimir Putin who saw the rouble fall to a record low against the dollar

This is good news for motorists and airlines but a disaster for the likes of Vladimir Putin who saw the rouble fall to a record low against the dollar.

The slump has been triggered by a huge increase in supply from the shale boom in the United States at a time of weak demand around the world.

OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – last week refused to cut production to prop up prices despite pleas from members including Venezuela.

Analysts described cheaper oil as a ‘tax cut’ for households and businesses – adding that it could boost the British and global economies by driving down the price of essentials from petrol to food.

‘The prospects for the world economy are much brighter with global oil prices at $70 per barrel than they were at $110,’ said Julian Jessop, an economist at Capital Economics.

He said gross domestic product around the world – the total size of the economy – could be 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent higher ‘as a result of the decline in oil prices’.

Shares in airlines including easyJet and British Airways owner International Airlines Group have soared in recent days following the fall in oil price

British supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons last week shaved another 2p off the price of a litre of petrol – setting the scene for a price war at the pumps this Christmas.

The AA said the price of litre of unleaded has fallen from 131.70p over the summer to 121.45p now while diesel is down from 136.37 a litre to 125.99p.

Luke Bosdet, a spokesman for the AA, said: ‘Lower pump prices are good for families. But the real benefit will be felt by the High Street retailers. 

'The timing of the fall in oil prices allows more money to be siphoned from fuel to Christmas spending. Families will be feeling warmer and happier this Christmas because they will have more money to spend. As a result retailers should see more money through their tills.’

Simon Williams, a spokesman for the RAC, said the falling oil price is ‘excellent news for motorists this Christmas’.

The falling price of oil is also likely to drive down the price of food as it makes it cheaper to produce by cutting the cost of everything from petrol to fertiliser.

It could also make holidays cheaper for British families as airlines lower their fares.

Shares in airlines including easyJet and British Airways owner International Airlines Group have soared in recent days.

At the same time, shares in oil companies such as BP and Shell have fallen on expectations that lower prices will hit profits.

Analysts at Berenberg Bank raised their growth forecast for the UK for 2015 from 2.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent on the back of the falling oil price.

They also expect inflation to fall from the current level of 1.3 per cent to 0.8 per cent before the end of the year as the price of everyday goods tumbles.

Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said low inflation means the Bank of England will be able to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5 per cent well into next year.

He added: ‘Cheap oil could give the recovery its fizz back, after the growth outlook had been dulled by eurozone troubles. The signs are tentative so far, but falling unemployment may finally be stirring British wage growth from its long slumber. 

'Combined with super low inflation, which has also been helped by falling food prices and other import costs, consumers should see meaningful gains in their purchasing power next year. That is a real change from the gloom that pervaded consumer income prospects just three to six months ago, and justifies our continued optimism.’

But lower oil prices mean lower tax revenues from the North Sea – leaving Chancellor George Osborne with even less room for giveaways in the Autumn Statement tomorrow (WEDS) or before the general election in May.

The slump in the oil price has piled pressure on some of the world’s main producers including Russia.

The Russian rouble was down as much as nine per cent to a record low against the US dollar yesterday – the biggest fall since the country’s currency crisis of 1998.

Oil and gas accounts for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues, making the country and the currency vulnerable to falling prices.

Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said the slide in the oil price is ‘reinforcing the loss of investor confidence in the rouble’ as the country reels from sanctions over its land grab in Ukraine.

Energy UK – which represents household energy suppliers such as British Gas – played down the prospect of lower bills.

A spokesman said: ‘End consumer prices may not always reflect changes in wholesale market prices as companies buy energy, weeks, months and years in advance as well as on the day ahead market. 

'This is to protect customers from short term fluctuations in price. As a result, changes in customer prices reflect long term trends, not short term ones.’
