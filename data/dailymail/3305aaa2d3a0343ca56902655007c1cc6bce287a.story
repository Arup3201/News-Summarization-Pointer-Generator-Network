Outspoken presenter Kirstie Allsopp took to Twitter to publicly shame a car driver who she caught littering

She is best known for giving straight-talking, no nonsense advice to property hunters on her hit TV show.

But outspoken presenter Kirstie Allsopp has shown she is not afraid to speak the truth on another issue close to her heart.

The star has taken to Twitter to publicly shame a car driver who she caught littering.

In a strongly-worded message Allsopp tweeted the number plate of a red car to her 369,000 followers and labelled the driver a ‘to***r’ after witnessing rubbish being dropped on the ground.

The term refers to the ‘Don’t be a T****r’ campaign which has previously been used by local councils and Keep Britain Tidy to encourage people to be more responsible when disposing of their waste.

Allsopp, 43, who has co-presented the property show for 15 years with 45-year-old Phil Spencer, wrote on Twitter: ‘The driver of this car is a t****r #teachersnott*****s @KeepBritainTidy’ alongside a picture of a red car taken in the dark.

The daytime television presenter is known for her hatred of ‘litter bugs’ and is a celebrity ambassador for Keep Britain Tidy.

Of the ‘Don’t be a T****r’ campaign, she has previously said: ‘For me it’s a brilliant slogan because it really sums up how terrible it is to chuck stuff out of cars.

‘Occasionally I’ll see someone throwing something out of a car and I’ll take a picture on my telephone and I’ll upload it on to Twitter and then Keep Britain Tidy can contact the DVLA.

‘People say to me “isn’t that a bit extreme, it’s just a bit of litter” but then when you explain to them about the £780m [spent on clearing litter when she spoke about this in 2010] which could be spent on hospitals, or schools or provision of care for the elderly, suddenly they think “oh that’s absolutely true”.

‘If each of us chucked a piece of litter out of our car every day we would be knee deep within weeks.’

In recent months Allsopp has also taken to Twitter to shame people who have not cleared up their dog’s mess.

In September she took a picture of three full dog poo bags dumped on the ground and captioned the photo: ‘Take it home you stupid, selfish t*****s’ and captioned another similar picture earlier in the year with the message ‘One day I will catch the t****s in my street doing this, it won’t be pretty @KeepBritainTidy.’

Allsopp, who has two sons with partner Ben Andersen and is step-mother to his two children from a previous relationship, has also backed the use of fines to punish people caught littering.

‘I’m really militant,’ she has said. ‘I’d be in favour of all sorts of things for litter because I think we have to make it clear that we all have a responsibility to our country, to the environment, to safety and health because litter involves all sorts of bigger issues.’

The presenter, who describes herself on Twitter as ‘A working Mum who’s incredibly blessed and occasionally on TV; Re-use, recycle, love, laugh & Keep Britain Tidy’ has also been behind shows such as Kirstie’s Homemade Home and Location, Location, Location.
