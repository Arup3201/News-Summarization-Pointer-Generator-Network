On a diet? Then consider sitting by the window the next time you eat out. 

A new book claims that where you sit in a restaurant can affect how many calories you consume.

Slim By Design author Professor Brian Wansink, director of Cornell's Food and Brand Lab, says that those who sit at high-top tables or in well-lit areas  make healthier menu choices.

It is one of a vast number of observations made by his team in a study of 27 restaurants across the U.S.

The researchers measured and mapped the layout of each restaurant and then used meal checks to track what diners ordered and how it related to where they sat.

The results were telling: people sitting farthest from the front door ate the fewest salads and were 73 per cent more likely to order dessert.

Those seated at a dark table or booth ate heavier food and ordered more of it, while diners seated at high-top bar tables ordered more salads and fewer desserts. 

'The darker it is, the more "invisible" you might feel, the less easy it is to see how much you're eating and the less conspicuous or guilty you might feel,' Professor Wansink explains in the book. 

In contrast, 'seeing the sunlight, people or trees outside might make you more conscious of how you look, might make you think about walking or might prompt a green salad.'

And if there are TV sets in the restaurant, steer clear. Professor Wansink found that the closer a table was to a screen, the more fried food the diners ordered. 

Another study featured in the book saw Professor Wansink's team study diners at 11 Chinese buffets across the U.S. over the course of two months.

The researchers analyzed behavior, food choices, where they sit and even how food is consumed, Professor Wansink writes, and they noticed key differences in the behavior of slim diners compared with larger diners. 

Why it matters where you sit: Those seated at a darker table or booth ate heavier food and ordered more of it, while diners seated at high-top bar tables ordered more salads and fewer desserts

Seventy-one per cent of slim diners, for instance, 'scouted out' the buffet offerings before picking up a plate, while larger diners started serving themselves immediately. Slim diners would then cherry-pick their favorites, while larger diners would serve themselves a bit of everything.  

Slim By Design: The book describes 'simple actions you can take to become permanently slimmer without really working at it'

Where they chose to sit varied dramatically too - 73 per cent of slim diners faced away from the buffet while overweight diners were three times more likely to sit facing the buffet. Professor Wansink believes this helped qualify their decision to go back for seconds, thirds or fourths. 

'Every time they saw someone take another lap around the stir fry, it reminded them that was "normal" behavior,' he writes.

The researchers also noted that slim diners chewed around 15 times per mouthful, three chews more than heavier diners. By eating more slowly, the diner consumes less in the time it takes for the brain to register satiety.

Professor Wansink's Slim By Design theory is about changing your eating environment to lose weight.

The book describes 'simple actions you can take to become permanently slimmer without really working at it.'

Professor Wansink is also the author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, and was appointed by the White House as the USDA executive director in charge of dietary guidelines for 2010 and the Food Guide Pyramid.
