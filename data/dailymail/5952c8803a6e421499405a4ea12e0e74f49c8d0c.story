Microsoft has released a video showcasing all the new features of its upcoming Windows 8.1 software, due to be released later this year.

Among changes to apps, tile options and an improved search, Jensen Harris from the Microsoft User Experience team also confirmed the company will be bringing the Windows Start button back.

Microsoft removed the button from the Windows 8 operating system when it was released last year but many customers complained and demanded it was put back.

A preview video earlier this month suggested that the update would reinstate the Start button, pictured. The button was removed from Windows 8

The lock screen is being turned into a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that will shows photos stored on the device and in SkyDrive.

Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar.

It also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen.

There are new personalisation options for tiles including colours and fonts.

Users can also customize the Start screen much more easily; changing sizes of app icons or controlling which apps appear.

For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface.

Windows 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view.

Many customers said that the new Windows 8 interface was too complicated, 
and sales of iPads and tablets have also eaten significantly into 
Microsoft's profits as users move away from desktop computers.

Screenshots leaked last month suggested that Microsoft would be reinstating the button and this latest video has confirmed it - albeit not directly.

During the demonstration, Harris swipes between screens and lands on the Desktop view.

A Windows logo is shown in the bottom left-hand corner.

Although it will not be labelled 'start', the leaked screenshots suggested that Windows logo would takes the user straight to a grid of applications.

The new Windows 8.1 also includes a 
vastly improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for 
documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar.

The feature resembles Apple's Spotlight feature.

The new software also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid 
by swiping up or pressing a button on-screen.

This should make it 
easy for unfamiliar users to get to the app they want quickly.

Users can also customize the start 
screen much more easily, changing sizes of app icon 'tiles' or 
controlling which apps appear.

For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface.

Windows
 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets
 the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view.

Microsoft has introduced new app tile sizes to the Windows 8.1 Start screen including small apps, pictured here for the Microsoft Office program app. Windows 8.1 also has more personalisation options for tile colours and fonts

That
 feature was missing in the initial version of Windows 8, which was 
designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended
 to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users.

Users will also no longer have to switch to the old desktop view to make changes in their default settings.

But
 they will still have to switch back to a traditional desktop set-up to 
use some programs such as Word or Excel, which have not been redesigned 
to function in the new Windows 8 style.

Windows 8.1 - codenamed Windows Blue - is expected to launch later this year.

Executives say the plan is now to update Windows periodically, rather than waiting three years or so between big releases.

The world's largest software company is 
hoping to kickstart sales of its latest Windows version, which has not
 made the splash with computer users it was hoping for.

Although
 Microsoft has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses since 
October, broadly in line with Windows 7 three years ago, the company 
must tackle a dwindling PC user base and its inability to make a mark in
 the exploding tablet market.

The lock screen on Windows 8.1 is being replaced by a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that automatically pulls in images from SkyDrive accounts

Shipments
 of traditional PCs - the most reliable gauge of Windows' popularity - 
are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year, while Microsoft's 
Surface has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market.

Windows 8 was designed to be used both on touch-screen tablets and traditional PCs.

But while touch-screen users tend to 
like the new 'tile'-based interface, many mouse and keyboard users 
complained that the new design was confusing.

Windows 8.1 will be available for free to all Windows 8 users some time later this year.

Microsoft will make a test version available at its annual developer conference on June 26.

Windows 8 was launched in October last year. Microsoft chose to remove the start button as part of the interface overhaul. This angered many users who said the new software was too complicated to use. In response to this backlash, Microsoft is reinstating the button into Windows 8.1 and making sorting apps and searching simpler
