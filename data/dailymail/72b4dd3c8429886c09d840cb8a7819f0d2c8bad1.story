Roberto Martinez knew the moment he had to make his move. Sitting in the stands of the Maracana, his eye was drawn to the scurrying No 7 who was pestering Lionel Messi.

This was the biggest game of Muhamed Besic’s life: Bosnia v Argentina. It was Bosnia’s first World Cup game watched by a capacity crowd inside one of football’s cathedrals. 

But, for 45 minutes, the combative midfielder bothered the greatest player in the world to distraction.

Muhamed Besic has played in all of Everton's games so far this season

Besic produced a sterling display against Argentina superstar Lionel Messi at the 2014 World Cup

‘He marked Messi out of the game in the first half,’ Martinez recalled, as he explained why he had to sign Besic for £4million from Ferencvaros last summer. 

‘I first became aware of him as a young boy at Hamburg. He’s a young man with incredible potential.’

Messi, ultimately, won the battle, scoring a magnificent goal in a 2-1 win but Martinez knew he had to bring Besic to Goodison Park. 

Without that performance, the 22-year-old would have been getting ready for a Champions League clash with Liverpool on Tuesday.

‘It was a big step up for me,’ Besic explains. ‘If I hadn’t gone, maybe I wouldn’t be playing here. I’d be in Switzerland with Basle. 

'They were interested. But after the World Cup Everton came in and clubs from Italy and Spain as well.’

It changed his life but it didn’t change him. Sat in the media room of Everton’s Finch Farm training base, with a woolly hat pulled tightly down on his head, it quickly becomes apparent it takes a lot to ruffle Besic; not even a mistake on his debut against Chelsea that led to a goal bothered him unduly.

He is economical with his words but that does not mean he isn’t an engaging interviewee and the story about going toe-to-toe with Messi gives an insight into his character.

‘It was good,’ he says with a smile. ‘Did I swap shirts? No. No. I always keep my shirts as playing for Bosnia means so much. I don’t have idols. 

'I liked Bayern Munich when I was younger for how they played. I’ve never supported a player or a team. I know it sounds strange but that’s how it is.’

That is why he won’t be losing any sleep over this afternoon’s trip to Manchester City. Besic will be in the heart of Everton’s midfield, charged with stopping Yaya Toure’s rampaging runs — but he will not be flinching from any challenges.

‘I do like to tackle,’ he says, with a glint in his eye. ‘But I am a little bit skinny so I need a bit more weight on me but I will make progress with that in time. 

'I am in the gym a lot, every day doing a little bit. I go at 100 per cent with every tackle. If a yellow card comes then I go slower.’

Born in Berlin, Besic began his career at Hamburg but ended up moving to Hungary after a fall-out with manager Thorsten Fink. One story claimed that Fink pinned Besic against the wall by the throat during a disagreement but he quickly dispels that story.

He also firmly explains why there was not the slightest hint of regret when he saw the country where he was born winning the World Cup this summer. 

The German FA made attempts to get him into their system but Besic would not be swayed.

‘I have no regrets at all,’ says Besic. ‘I had an approach to play for the Under 19s. Maybe it would have been better for my career at that time to choose Germany but my heart always said Bosnia. It was just inside my heart, I could never say what.

Besic has also established himself as a regular starter for his country, Bosnia

‘My parents never tried to influence me or said “You have to play for Bosnia”. They just let me make my decision. All the Bosnia players are like this. 

'The people have a strong mentality. I can’t explain why but back in Bosnia I feel better.’

He will be back among friends at the Etihad Stadium as Edin Dzeko is there to welcome him. They do not have plans to share dinner after the game but it is clear that Dzeko has helped Besic and his girlfriend, Jessica, settle into life in England.

‘Edin said I would have to be patient when I arrived because the league is so different,’ Besic explains. 

‘He said it’s the best league in the world. Roberto Martinez then told me about Everton and how the fans were so passionate. He explained about the club’s history.

‘So far I have shown about 50 per cent of what they will see. I need a bit more time but I hope in another half year, when I am really settled, my quality will come out. 

My ambitions? My ambition is to win every game I play. Whether it is Manchester City or whoever — I want to win.’ And Lionel Messi, for one, can verify that combative streak.
