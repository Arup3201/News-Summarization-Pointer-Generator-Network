Harry Redknapp has confirmed he will sign a new two-year contract extension at QPR.

The 67-year-old, who has been at the club since November 2012, led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt following relegation last season, and despite a poor start this time around chairman Tony Fernandes is set to offer him a new deal.

He said: 'I've been offered a new contract and it's just a case of me signing it now - which I will. I probably won't read it anyway - I'll just sign it.

'It'll probably get signed either today or tomorrow, but if not next week. Either way it'll get done as Tony has been asking me about it for a while.

'I'm happy at the club and want to stay here. The Premier League is where I want to be and it's where we will be next season as we will stay up.'

The former Tottenham boss also quashed rumours he was set to leave the club following reports Tim Sherwood was being lined up to replace him adding: 'It's absolute rubbish, we've played two games, he (Fernandes) wants me to sign a two-year extension. 

'I knew it was going to be a difficult start. We have bought good players in but we need time to gel. It takes time.'

Redknapp also confirmed that unsettled midfielder Adel Taarabt will be involved against Sunderland on Saturday with his future still very much up in the air.

He said: 'Adel will be involved tomorrow. He done well on Wednesday at Burton so he'll be in the squad for the Sunderland game.'

The maverick playmaker has been pushing for a move away from Loftus Road all summer with AC Milan his preferred option, but so far a move has failed to materialise with his £65,000-per-week wage packet and buy-out clause proving to be the stumbling blocks.

Elsewhere Redknapp confirmed that Eduardo Vargas will be unavailable for the game against Gus Poyet's side, with him yet to receive international clearance.

'We're still waiting to hear about Eduardo Vargas's work permit. He's still in Italy sorting out his passport so he won't be available for Saturday's game,' said Redknapp.

The former Tottenham boss has also revealed that the club have accepted bids from Leicester City and Crystal Palace  for defensive duo Danny Simpson and Armand Traore respectively.

On a potential deal concerning the latter Redknapp added: 'Palace have made a good offer for Armand and it's up to him now if he wants to go, so we'll see what happens with that.' 

Neil Warnock, who re-joined Crystal Palace for a second spell as manager earlier this week, is keen on a reunion with Traore, who he signed when he was QPR boss in 2011.
