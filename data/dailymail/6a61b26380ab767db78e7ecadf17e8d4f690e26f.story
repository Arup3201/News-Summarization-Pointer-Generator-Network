George Zimmerman's parents have spoken out for the first time following his acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin, saying that their son is not a racist and that they haven't spoken to him since he left the courtroom on Saturday.

Robert and Gladys Zimmerman said that they fear that anytime they call their son, their phones will be tapped, leading to people finding out his location - a hideout so secretive that even they have no idea where he is living.

They revealed that their son's legal saga has left them broke. They had to flee their own house and fear for their own lives, as well as George's, following countless death threats.

'Only time will tell,' Gladys said when predicting what whether or not George and his wife Shelly will ever be able come out of hiding.

'Even for us who have not been living a normal life for the past months, it is hard because we have lost everything,' she said of her and her husband Robert.

'If I was him, I would (stay in hiding),' Robert said during the ABC interview, the first portion of which was aired Monday evening.

The Zimmermans have stood by their son since he became the subjects of massive public anger and protests when he was named as the man who killed unarmed Trayvon Martin.

They have both given TV interviews before - but never together.

Robert is a retired Virginia court magistrate. Gladys is Peruvian by birth and raised the couple's three children.

As protests over the verdict rage on, the next step in the legal saga is the prospect that the Justice Department will file civil charges against Zimmerman, potentially trying him on the grounds that the shooting of Martin was considered a hate crime.

Gladys said she cannot do say to satiate the protestors who are seeking vengeance for the killing of teenage Travyon.

'This is America, and we went through all of this with the judicial system,' Gladys said. 'They wanted an arrest for my son. They got an arrest. Now lets, you know, find a verdict ... now they have a verdict.

'He
went through the whole process they were pushing for, and now they are 
not happy with the verdict, and I pray. I pray for them, for God to 
touch their heart.'

In their first televised interview with Barbara Walters on ABC News, Robert Zimmerman defended his son, saying that claims that prejudice caused the violent outcome are false.

When asked if George is racist, Robert said: 'absolutely not. He's never been taught to be a racist.'

'When George first saw Trayvon Martin he had no idea what color he was.

'He knew he was inside a gated community. He didn't recognize him as living there. It was raining. He was just casually walking very slowly. But George did not initially know what race a person was.'

While not going into details, Robert 
and Gladys said that their lives have been completely uprooted since the
trial, and that they have been just some on the growing roster of 
targets for death threats.

'We've had an enormous amount of death threats,' Robert Zimmerman said. 'George's legal counsel has had death threats, the police chief of Sanford. May people have had death threats.'

He said the words that have been sent to them by supporters of Trayvon's family have been sickening.

'Everyone with Georgie's DNA should be killed' - just every kind of horrible thing you can imagine,' Robert said.

'I never thought that we would see so much hatred, and the hatred is not brought on by any racial incident.

'It was brought on by attorneys being totally untruthful, other people being involved, having a certain narrative, having a certain agenda, and making this situation race-based and a political issue.'

Their
fear has kept the Zimmermans from reaching out to their controversial 
son, with their only interaction being inside the courtroom immediately 
following the verdict.

'I hug him, I kiss him and he said "Thank you mom, I want to go home,"' Gladys told Walters.

Asked what they would say to the parents of Trayvon, Gladys said there was little that words could do.

'It's nothing I can tell them, it's only something I can do: I can pray,' she said.

'We are deeply sorry for this tragedy, and we pray for the departed, we pray for Trayvon Martin.'
