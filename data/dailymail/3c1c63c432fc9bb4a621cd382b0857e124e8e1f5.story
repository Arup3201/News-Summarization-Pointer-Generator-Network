Adele Greenacre, now 36, was just 11 weeks old when her father Derek walked out of the family home in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, and never returned.

Now, after launching a Facebook campaign to find him, the devoted daughter has finally been reunited with her father - more than three decades later.

Inspired by the no make-up selfie craze, Mrs Greenacre posted an old photo of her father on the social networking site, and 21,000 shares later, was contacted by a man living in Geneva who claimed to know her father.

Back together: Adele Greenacre was finally reunited with her father Derek after spending 30 years apart

An hour later, he phoned again - this time with her father's mobile number to hand. Mrs Greenacre then called the number and, within moments, found herself speaking to her father for the first time in 30 years.

'A man had seen my Facebook post, which had been shared over 21,000 times, and Skyped me all the way from Geneva in Switzerland, to say he knew my dad,' beams Mrs Greenacre.

'They
 had known each other because of The Passage homeless charity that 
picked up my dad a few years ago and he, too, had been homeless.

'An hour later, he called back and gave me a number. I rang it and then there he was, on the end of the phone, my dad.'

Derek was 33 when he walked out on Mrs Greenacre's mother Wendy Beever, now 63, and never returned.

Forgiveness: Adele, who has three children of her own, says she isn't looking for answers

The
 family believed he was going to work at a nearby leisure centre where 
he was a manager but at 11am they received a call from his secretary 
saying he hadn't arrived.

They
 spent the day searching and discovered his car parked in front of 
Nottingham Station, and concluded that he had taken a train to 
London.

Nottinghamshire Police
 also conducted extensive inquiries at the time but were unable to find 
Derek - who never made contact with his friends or family again.

Speaking
 about the day he left, Ms Beever said: 'On that
 morning he had to be in early for a staff meeting, so he got up to 
leave.

'But he forgot his keys and when he came back to get them, I was changing Adele. There were no computers back then. We had to do everything by post or by telephone. It was very hard.'

Despite her father's disappearance and refusal to contact her or her family, Mrs Greenacre says she is thrilled to have found him - and isn't looking for answers.

'When
 I first got to his house, I was very thrown and very scared,' remembers Mrs Greenacre. 'I knew I couldn't
 go and expect anything. But it worked out amazingly.

'We spent seven hours together and got on like a house on fire. It's been amazing, the best 24 hours of my life.'

Mrs Greenacre, who has three children, Callum, 18, Oskar, nine, and Kazia, five, of her own, added: 'I wasn't looking for answers. Just knowing him was enough for me.

'I want to thank each and every person who read and shared my post online, as without all of you, I would never have found him. It is a fairy tale ending and I am just so happy.'
