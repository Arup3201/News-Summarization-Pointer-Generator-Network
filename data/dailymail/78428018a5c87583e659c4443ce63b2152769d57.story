Pumpkins are typically filled with candy come Halloween but border officials stumbled upon a nasty surprise in some festive decorations at border control today.

Three pumpkins were discovered on Thursday in a passenger's luggage at Montreal airport, in  Quebec stuffed with two kilograms of a white powder believed to be cocaine. 

A woman was arrested after scanning equipment discovered masses inside the seasonal squash.

The pumpkins containing bags filled with suspected cocaine were found in luggage at Montreal International Airport on Halloween

The female passenger's baggage contained three pumpkins filled with suspected cocaine. She was arrested by Canadian border police on Thursday

The excess weight turned out to be bags filled with the chalky substance. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have taken over the investigation.

A Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) could not confirm where the passenger was traveling from or whether she held Canadian citizenship.

'Border services officers work tirelessly to intercept narcotics regardless how they are hidden,' said Benoît Chiquette, the CBSA's Regional Director General for the Quebec Region.

'This seizure helps eradicate narcotics from our community by stopping potential traffickers from using our international airports for their illicit cross-border activities.'

The CBSA says that since the beginning of 2013, Montreal's airport has had 173 drug seizures.

Ten of those involved cocaine - with roughly 44 kilos seized.

Scanners at Montreal airport detected dark masses inside the pumpkins causing them to be searched - 2kg of white powder was found inside

The pumpkins had been hollowed out and the bags of white powder stuffed inside when they were investigated today

A female traveler was caught at Montréal-Trudeau Airport today with nearly two kilograms of suspected cocaine inside pumpkins. It is not clear where she was traveling from or whether she is a Canadian citizen
