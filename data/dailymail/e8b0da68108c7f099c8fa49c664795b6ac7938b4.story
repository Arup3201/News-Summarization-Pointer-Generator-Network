A grieving relative has been blocked her from cremating her aunt in a cardboard coffin by penpushers because it is 'too dangerous.'

Marianne Stevens, 73, ordered a brightly coloured, cardboard coffin painted with flowers for her 'favourite' aunt who died of brain cancer aged 90.

But she was left stunned after bureaucrats at Eastbourne Borough Council, East Sussex, told her that the eco-friendly coffins were banned from the crematorium.

The grandmother-of-three has been left feeling that she has failed her beloved aunt, Mary Pilz, who cared greatly about the environment. 

Marianne, who is arranging the February 5 funeral from her home in Australia as she is fighting her own battle with breast cancer, reluctantly is having her auntie cremated in a wooden box.

'I ordered a beautiful floral cardboard coffin only to be told that the council won't allow it,' she said.

'How appalling that a wooden coffin has to be used for a cremation whereas a cardboard one is more ecologically sound.

'I just can't understand why they would think that cardboard is dangerous.

'I thought a lovely, floral cardboard coffin would be super for my aunt, who loved colour and flowers, but sadly I am having to order a plain ordinary wooden one. I am very upset about it.

'This was the last act I was going to do for my aunt and I fell I have failed her.'

The floral cardboard coffin is thought to be similar to the one Coronation Street character Hayley Cropper was buried in on the beloved ITV soap.

A spokesman for the council explained that the borough outlawed the eco-friendly boxes after carrying out a 'risk assessment'.

He said: 'The differences in structure and cremating properties of paper product coffins led to a risk assessment being carried out.

'During the cremation process, paper-based materials handle and combust differently to other products.

'Fly ash and residue can also interfere with out emission treatment and monitoring systems, which are in place to ensure we meet stringent emission limit laid down by the Department for Environment, Flood and Rural Affairs.

'As a result, and to ensure continued safe operation of the facility, the council took the decision not to accept paper product coffins for cremation.'

But if a relative is looking for an eco-friendly alternative, then bamboo boxes can be used, he added.

Cardboard coffins were once seen  as a flimsy, cheap option that lacked dignity.

But in the last few years, as environmental awareness has grown, more and more people are turning to the relatively inexpensive casket as eco-friendly and modern alternative.

A quarter of people, who took part in a Royal Mail survey, said they would go for a more eco friendly cardboard coffin.

They can be bought for as little as £60 and can come in a huge range of colours and designs.

They can also be personalised and can be turned into anything from planes. guitars and even skips.

Most standard cardboard coffins can hold a person of around 23 stone in weight, but many companies can supply stronger ones if necessary. 

Cardboard coffins are also bio-degradable and are said to be suitable for burials and cremations.
