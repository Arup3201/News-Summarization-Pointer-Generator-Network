The village shop and post office at the heart of Britain's 'most desirable community' has gone on the market for £750,000.

Cerne Abbas, in Dorset, was voted the most sought-after village in the country thanks to its proximity to outstanding schools, welcoming country pubs and its quality of housing.

Now, for the first time in more than 30 years, the popular village stores and post office, with a spacious six-bedroom home wrapped around it, has gone up for sale.

The shop in Cerne Abbas, Dorset, has a weekly turnover of £10,000 and comes with a spacious six-bedroom property

Cerne Abbas Stores has been at the heart of the community for over 250 years, with the current owners Andrew and Gerry Farrow moving to the village in 1984. 

In 1993, villagers showed their community spirit, raising £12,000 in just three days to stop the shop going bankrupt when Mr Farrow was faced with rising debts from improvements he was forced to make to meet hygiene regulations.

Mr Farrow, who used to work as an accountant in London, and his wife saved the village post office in 2006 when he took over as sub-postmaster after the previous one retired.

The quaint double-fronted shop has thrived since and now has a turnover of about £10,000 a week.

Estate agents Savills ruled the Dorset village, which has a population of about 800, the most attractive village in Britain to prospective buyers.

The quaint double-fronted shop has thrived and would be perfect for someone looking to escape the rat race, estate agents Christie & Co say

Jonathan Southgate, of estate agents Christie & Co, said: 'The village shop has been in the same spot, in the same building for 250 years. It really has been a staple of the community.

'The couple who own it are looking to retire.

'This gentleman originally moved from the home counties and that's who we think this would appeal to - somebody who is fed up with the rat race and wants a slice of country life with a business that will support that.

'This business would be perfect for a husband and wife team or two families coming together.

'It's a really pretty village, it was voted most desirable village and it's had many accolades over the years. It's a really lovely place to live.'

As well as the shop, the accommodation goes over three floors and has six double bedrooms, a family bathroom, a shower room and a separate bathroom.

'Desirable' Cerne Abbas is also well-known for its 180ft chalk giant figure on a nearby hill

Mr Farrow, 65, said: 'There are various things in the community that are focal points and we are the main one. There's also three pubs and a tea rooms.

'It's not a big village but it's got a lot of facilities and it's a tourist destination.

'I think that's why the shop has survived so well. We stock what the customers want and make sure they leave with a smile on their face.

'We also open seven days a week so we get trade from other nearby villages.

'But my wife wants me to do other things now, and I want to. I've just finished my second honours degree and advanced French exam and feel it's time for a change.

'I think it needs a fresh pair of eyes and enthusiasm to make the store even better.'

Cerne Abbas, near Dorchester, appears in Thomas Hardy's novels as Abbots Cernel and has a 13th century church as well as the ruins of a Benedictine abbey.

The village is also well-known for its 180ft chalk giant figure on a nearby hill.
