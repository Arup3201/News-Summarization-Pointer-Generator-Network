It landed in a blaze of jets that scorched the martian surface, has burnt holes in rocks and scooped up soil before messily dumping it.

Now Nasa's Curiosity rover finally seems to be making amends - and acting uncannily like Pixar's Wall-e cleaning robot - by sweeping nearby rocks clean.

The latest part of its mission saw the rover use specially designed brushes (or dirt removal tools, as the space agency calls them) to reveal nearby rocks scientists were interested in.

The rotating wire bristles cleared a roughly 5cm-wide patch on an area of ground dubbed 'Ekwir 1' by scientists.

Brushing away the dust gives the robot's survey instruments a clearer view of the texture and chemistry of the underlying rock.

The tool is a motorized, wire-bristle brush on the turret at the end of the rover's arm.

The rover is currently investigating a location in Mars' Gale Crater 
known as Yellowknife Bay, a small depression several hundred metres from
the point where it landed back in August, where scientists were interested in rock patterns.

'We wanted to be sure we had an optimal target for the first use [of the
dust removal tool]," said Diana Trujillo from Nasa's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory.

'We need to place the instrument within less than half an inch of the 
target without putting the hardware at risk.

'We needed a flat target, 
one that wasn't rough, one that was covered with dust.

'The results 
certainly look good.'

Curiosity is still yet to use its hammer-drill, the last major tool yet to be deployed on the mission.

It it hopes that by brishing rocks, researchers can find a rock suitable for drilling.

The 'dirt removal tool' - or wire brush, is one of Curiosity's several tools.
