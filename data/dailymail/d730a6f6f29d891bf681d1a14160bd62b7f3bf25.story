A new storm has erupted over tickets for the London 2012 Paralympics after some disabled parents were told they cannot sit with their families while watching the games.

Wheelchair-user mothers and fathers have been shocked to find out that they cannot be seated with their young children because of 'discriminatory' seating rules.

They claim to have been told that only one accompanying adult could join them in the wheelchair area while children need to be sat with at least one able-bodied adult.

Wheelchair-users mothers and fathers have complained that only one person is allowed to accompany them at paralympic venues

Disabled mother-of-two Beth Davis-Hofbauer said she felt 'non-human' when she was told her family could not sit with her at the events which start on August 29.

Outraged by the poor provisions for disabled visitors she has launched a petition on Change.org which has attracted more than 12,000 signatures.

The wheelchair user of Fareham, Hampshire said she had tried to book tickets for a cycling event at the Velodrome for her husband and carer, Ed, autistic four-year-old son Milo and her baby daughter.

But she claims a LOCOG official told her because she was disabled only one accompanying adult could sit with her in the wheelchair area.

The 32-year-old said: 'They wouldn't even allow me to pay full adult price for the children to sit on my lap. They said my kids, would have to sit somewhere else - which of course they could absolutely not.

'I felt non-human. It's because I'm in a wheel-chair. I cannot believe that at this event, which could inspire a new generation of athletes, has a discriminatory ticket policy.

'Quite apart from these practical considerations I want to share this special occasion with my family.'

However, she added: 'This isn't just about my family - it's about making sure every family is able to enjoy the Paralympics together now and in the future.'

Mrs Davies-Hofbauer says she is unable to attend any of the Paralympic events because of the seating plans and lack of consideration for families with a disabled parent or child.

She said another adult would have to buy a ticket to accompany her children as it is essential her husband sits with her.

She added: 'We like to do things together, despite me being in a wheelchair, and I can't believe that LOCOG have not made the provisions to cater for me and other families. It's an outrage.'

The self-styled 'mumpreneur' who runs a craft box company Little Doers said: 'I don't want special treatment - I just want to be treated the same as everyone else.'

Another disabled mother; Melissa Chapin, 43, who bought six tickets eleven months ago for her eight-year-old twins, Ben and Mia, two wheelchair users and their carers, has labelled the seating rules a 'fiasco'.

The actress from Milton Keynes, who specialises in professional voice-over work, said she contacted the tickets official after seeing the online petition.

She said: 'When I spoke to the ticketing agent I was told I shouldn't have been sold the tickets as the children can't attend in without adult supervision. I was furious and shouted 'I am an adult!'

'She also told me that the computer system won't sell children's tickets without an accompanying adult.

'I am the twins' sole carer, just like other single mums. It just so happens I'm sitting on wheels.

'She then backtracked and said she meant a non-disabled adult.'

The mother from Milton Keynes added: 'The Olympics planners have clearly made a terrible blunder and it is going to cause enormous pain and heartbreak for families planning to attend the Paralympics.'

The Games' organisers denied they had a policy that wheelchair users could only be accompanied by one other person when attending events.

A LOCOG spokesman said: 'We designed our venues such that accessible seating will be located around the new venues at different price points so that wheelchair users can sit with their friends and families rather than in one single designated area, and we included a companion seat in the cost of a ticket for a wheelchair space.

'With just a couple of weeks to go to the Games, many sessions are now selling out and additional spaces are subject to the same availability as for non-wheelchair users.'

The organisers for the Paralympics and the Olympic London 2012 Games have been under fire for poor organisation of tickets throughout both games.

More than 2.2 million tickets have already been sold for the 12-day Paralympic Games, and another 400,000 are due to go on sale in the coming days.

But technical issues have prevented thousands from buying tickets online which has prompted a further wave of criticism on Twitter.

LOCOG admitted the unexpected surge for tickets had caused initial problems but insisted these had now been resolved.
