Liverpool have agreed a deal with Bayern Munich for Pepe Reina with the goalkeeper set for a medical on Wednesday as he finally heads for a permanent exit.

The Spaniard spent last season out on loan at Napoli after being frozen out by Brendan Rodgers, with seemingly no way back into the manager's plans.

Reina did fly out to America with the Reds last week and trained with the squad but didn't even make the bench against Manchester United in the International Champions Cup on Monday night.

Karl-Heinz Rummenigge expanded on the club's official website, saying: 'The player will come to Munich in the next few days for a medical exam and to sign his contract. Pepe Reina was eager to come to Bayern Munich.

'He wanted to embark on this adventure even though he knows that, in Manuel Neuer, he has a keeper in front of him who, if nothing changes, will always remain the number one.'

Rodgers has made no secret of preferring Simon Mignolet in between the sticks as the ex-Sunderland 'keeper immediately commanded the No 1 spot at Anfield on arrival. 

The writing was on the wall for Reina from the get-go and Liverpool have allowed the 31-year-old to talk to the German champions after a bid in the region of £2million. 

Reina has attracted interest from Napoli and AC Milan although neither are able to match his financial demands with the keeper commanding around £110,000 a week.

However, the finances are no problem for wealthy Bayern. All that remains is for Reina to agree.

Pep Guardiola's side face an MLS All-Star XI on Wednesday, but Reina is unlikely to be involved. 

And that could be a recurring theme, with Manuel Neuer an immovable object in goal for Bayern. Current Bayern Munich reserve Tom Starke and rival Lukas Raeder each featured in two games last season. 

Reina fits the bill as an experienced alternative after starring on the European and international stage for Liverpool and his country. 

Liverpool are wrapping up a deal for Javier Manquillo from Atletico Madrid and are continuing negotiations with Sevilla over a £16m deal for Spain left-back Alberto Moreno which could yet include 20-year-old midfielder Suso going to Sevilla on loan.

As well as adding to his defensive ranks, Guardiola also seems keen to keep hold of the players he has and on Tuesday dismissed reports linking central defender Jerome Boateng with Barcelona.

Spain's Marca radio suggested the Catalan club were closing in on the Germany defender, an alternative candidate to his compatriot Mats Hummels to reinforce the Primera Division side's defence this season.

But speaking at a press conference in Portland, where Bayern are currently preparing for the new season, Guardiola said there was no truth whatsoever to the story and he had no intention of letting the former Manchester City defender go.

'I don't usually say anything about things I read in the newspaper, but I am planning 100 percent with him here,' Guardiola said.

The Spaniard added that he did not expect club bosses to order him to sell any of his first-choice players either as the Bavarians prepare an assault on a hat-trick of Bundesliga titles this season.

He need not worry about that in the case of Boateng, though, with Rummenigge telling the Bild newspaper that the rumours were 'laughable'.

Boateng joined Bayern from City in 2011 and he extended his contract until 2018 only last December.
