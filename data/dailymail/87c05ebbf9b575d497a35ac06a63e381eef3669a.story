Union official Kathy Jackson sobbed as she described being forced into a mental hospital as the stress of taking on corrupt union boss Michael Williamson took its toll.

Ms Jackson broke down as she gave evidence to the royal commission into union corruption, describing how she was committed to a Melbourne psychiatric hospital in September 2011, a week after finding a shovel on her doorstep in an apparent death threat.

'I have never been under such immense pressure or stress in my whole life,' the Health Services Union national secretary said.

'I now understand what drives people to do certain things.'

Ms Jackson was discharged from the hospital after four days and resumed her campaign to expose Williamson's corruption, despite advice from her doctors to walk away.

Williamson was jailed for seven and a half years after being found guilty of fraud in March of this year.

The 60-year-old must serve five years before he is eligible for parole.

Earlier on Wednesday, Ms Jackson said her suspicion Williamson was crooked 'crystallised' after visiting his 'palatial' holiday home, but she was worried about reporting him due to his power.

In January 2011, Ms Jackson and her children went to the jailed former Labor president's new retreat at Brightwaters, near Lake Macquarie.

'It was this occasion which crystallised my suspicions of corruption,' she told the commission in Sydney.

'I perceived that Mr Williamson and his family enjoyed a lifestyle that could not be sustained on his legitimate income.'

All of Williamson's kids had been to private schools, 'there was bordered herringbone hardwood parquetry throughout ... a high-end audio visual system built into the room... and four European fridges' in the 'palatial' lakeside property, Ms Jackson said.

There was also talk of building an in-ground pool and kabana, and buying a boat.

Ms Jackson said she asked Williamson what he would do if his lake view was blocked by a house being built next door.

'He said 'oh don't worry about that. We've bought the place next door as well,' Ms Jackson said.

Despite her concerns Williamson's opulent lifestyle was funded by corruption, Ms Jackson said she 'agonised' for months about whether to report her boss.

'I felt conflicted as I knew I had a duty to do something about the corruption I was witnessing, however Mr Williamson's power and standing within the ALP and the Labor movement made me hesitant to take any action without real evidence,' she said.

Ms Jackson had tried to obtain the unions financial records several times, but they were never released to her, outside meetings, on grounds they were commercial in confidence, the commission heard.

Fears that she would suffer similar treatment dished out to Mark Hardacre, another HSU official who made allegations against Williamson, also kept Ms Jackson silent.

'Everybody knew that if you took on Mr Williamson he destroyed you financially,' she said.

'That is what Mr Williamson did to Mr and Mrs Hardacre.'

Meanwhile, HSU NSW secretary Gerard Hayes disputes Ms Jackson's evidence, saying she 'never presented documentary evidence of Michael Williamson's corruption to me.'

'I formed my view of Michael Williamson's corruption completely independently of Kathy Jackson,' he said in a statement to AAP.

'I paid a great price for standing up to Michael Williamson, sacrificing my job, suffering abuse and living with uncertainty for a considerable period. I look forward to having the chance to tell my story at the Royal Commission.'

The hearing continues.
