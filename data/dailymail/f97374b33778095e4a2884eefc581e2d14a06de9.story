A 67-year-old fisherman who sent out a distress signal off the coast of Hawaii on Thanksgiving day has been found and rescued 64 miles out to sea - nine days after the US Coast Guard called off the search for him.

Ron Ingraham reemerged with a simple distress call on Tuesday morning: 'We got a mayday here. Mayday. This is the Malia. Anybody picking this up?'

He was dehydrated and hungry, but otherwise healthy. A Coast Guard cutter is towing his crippled 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, back to its port in Kaunakakai.

Ron Ingraham, 67, was rescued on Tuesday morning after 12 days lost at sea. His friends and family had planned a funeral service for Saturday

Ingraham will arrive home in time to attend his own funeral - which friends and family had planned for Saturday, KITV reports.

His son, Zakary Ingraham, told KHNL-TV that he got a call at his home in St Joseph, Missouri, on Tuesday morning.

'They said, "Well, we found your dad. He's alive and well on his boat." For him to be found is awesome. I can't believe it,' he said.

Ron Ingraham, an experienced fisherman, was sailing alone from Kaunakakai Harbor to Manele Bay on Lanai on November 27, Thanksgiving Day - a journey that should have put him no more than five miles from land at any time.

But something went horribly wrong. On the day he left, he sent out two distress signals that his boat was taking on water. The Coast Guard pinpointed his message as coming 46 miles west of Kailua-Kona - dramatically off his course. 

The Coast Guard mounted a massive search effort - flying 59 airborne mission that covered 12,000 square miles with in five days. However, the distress signal went dark and planes and helicopters found no signs of Ingraham's boat. 

On December 1, Coast Guard commanders called off the search effort after failing to find Ingraham. 

Crippled: Ingraham's 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, had both masts snapped and the outboard motor mangled. It was towed back to his home port

Rescued: Ingraham sent a distress call far off course - and was found 80 miles from his original mayday signal

The Navy destroyer the USS Paul Hamilton happened to be just 14 miles from the Malia when the new distress signal came in. It rushed over and rescued the sailor

Then, nine days later, he resurfaced with a miraculous mayday call. A Coast Guard post picked up the distress signal and pinpointed it 64 miles south of Oahu - or about 80 miles from his first distress call.

A Navy destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton was nearby and rushed to Ingraham's aid.

They found him healthy - though his board was crippled. 

Both his main masts had snapped and the outboard motor was mangled. He was sailing under the power of a tiny auxiliary sail, attempting to make it back to land. 

Coast Guard authorities have no idea how he ended up so far from shore. And it remains a mystery how Ingraham was able to survive for 12 days at sea. 

'Twelve days, man. He's a champ! He's tough!' his son told KHNL.

And now, the memorial service that had been planned in Kaunakakai to mourn Ingraham's death has been revised. It's not a welcome home party. 

'We're going to turn it into a celebration instead of a funeral,' pal Chris Connor told KITV.
