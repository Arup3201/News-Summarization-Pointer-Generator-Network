Gone are the days of spontaneously buying  your beloved roses, taking them out for supper or reminding them they look nice.

These days we all need gentle reminders to do these things. Like a prod in the ribs. Or the beep of a phone.

And while Kahnoodle - a San Francisco-based 'couples' app' that promises to save your relationship - can't get do the former, it's very good at doing the latter.

Put the cuddles and romance back into your relationship with help from Kahnoodle, the new couples' app that reminds you to be nice to each other

Log dates, collect Koupons and get tips for keeping your relationship on solid ground with the couples' app

Founders claim Kahnoodle 'makes it easier for busy couples to stay awesome' by enabling you to log nice things you and your partner do for each other and collect 'koupons' to buy treats.

The more kind things you do for your partner, the more full your 'love tank' becomes....

The app will even send you push notifications reminding you to 'give an affectionate touch', 'surprise them', 'buy a gift' or even initiate sex.

'Novelty
works like an endorphin,' Zuhairah Scott Washington, the company's
founder, told The Atlantic. 'Couples have a desire to go out and do something new, but 
oftentimes they're tired.

'The mobile app… incorporates a lot of research
on what makes relationships successful but gamifies it to make it fun, 
makes it fun to do the work required to keep relationships fresh.'

But psychologist Eli Finkel of Northwestern University worries the app might be detrimental, allowing people to sit back, relax and take the effort and thoughtfulness out of acts of love.

He said: 'Much of the benefit of doing considerate things is linked to the fact that those things required thoughtfulness and effort. Take the thoughtfulness out of the acts and they lose much of their meaning.'

The Kama Sutra has been brought into the 21st century with an app that enables couples to study its poses in 3D.

The
technology transforms the ancient Hindu manual’s illustrations into 
holograms which pop up in front of a smartphone or tablet to give users a
complete view of the guide’s sexual diagrams.

The free app comes with a new version of the text, which was originally written in Sanskrit 2,000 years ago.

Each image can be seen from all angles meaning users are offered an un-obstructed, complete view.

The
Kama Xcitra promises to help couples master positions set out in the 
original book and ensure they are brought 'closer to the action than 
ever before'.

The app works
in conjunction with 69 poses and allows users to customise the 
appearance of models, changing hair and skin colour as well as adding 
music as a soundtrack.

A
spokesman for the publishers of the Kama Xcitra, which is available on 
Amazon, said people had turned to the Kama Sutra for guidance on having a
fulfilling love life for centuries. But she added: ‘Some of the more 
challenging positions like the Prone Tiger, the Catherine Wheel or the 
Peg have left readers a little baffled. Until now.’

The Kama Sutra is widely considered to be the primary Sanskrit work on human sexuality.

It was first translated into English in 1883 under the guidance of Victorian explorer Richard Burton.

Therapy traditionally consists of sitting on a comfortable sofa while pouring your heart out to a counsellor.

But in this digital age, online therapy is just as beneficial - if not more so - than conventional therapy.

According to a new study from the University of Zurich, therapy sessions carried out online have become increasingly common in recent years.

Death of the therapist's couch? A new study found that online therapy is more effective than the traditional face-to-face kind

Many sites, like 
Breakthrough.com and California Live Visit, have created a network of 
therapists who use instant messages, emails and even video chats to help
their patients.

To 
investigate how effective this method was, researchers asked six 
therapists to treat 62 patients suffering from moderate depression.

After
being randomly divided into two groups, one was treated online - 
through email or instant messenger - while the other received 
face-to-face therapy.

Both groups received eight sessions consisting of cognitive therapy techniques.

Speaking about the results, Professor Andreas Maercker said: 'In both groups, the depression values fell significantly.'

Online treatment: Researchers put its success down, in part, to the paper trail it generates.

Fifty-three per cent of those treated
online were no longer diagnosed with depression, compared to 50 per 
cent of those who had face-to-face therapy.

During follow-up sessions, it was found that rates of recovery among those treated online were higher than the patients who saw counsellors in person.

At
the end of the study, 57 per cent of patients who underwent online 
treatment were free of depression, compared to 42 per cent of those who 
had traditional therapy.

Researchers put the online success down, in part, to the paper trail it generated. Patients were able to re-read the correspondence with their therapist, keeping it fresh in their mind, whereas those who had real-life therapy quickly forgot advice given.

Maercker added: 'In the medium term, online psychotherapy yields even better results.

'Our study is evidence that psychotherapeutic services on the internet are an effective supplement to therapeutic care.'
