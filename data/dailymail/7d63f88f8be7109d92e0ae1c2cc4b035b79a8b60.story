This is the deadly arsenal of military-grade weaponry discovered at the home of a French terror suspect who was shot dead in his car by special forces as he travelled along a motorway.

French Algerian Hakim Benladghem was gunned down in his 4x4 on the A8 Lille-Brussels 
motorway in Belgium on Tuesday as he reached out to grab a weapon on the passenger seat.

Tapped phone calls led police to believe that Benladghem was on his way to Brussels where he was about to embark on a sustained series of terror attacks across Europe.

They suspect the 39-year-old was one of three men who robbed a restaurant in Anderlecht last week, shooting the owner twice in the leg and stealing eight guns. The other two suspects have been arrested.

French police had been tracking Benladghem for several years and had tipped off the Belgium authorities about his suspicious activities when he moved there in 2008.

A search of his home in Anderlecht revealed the hoard of guns and other military-equipment, which French and Belgium intelligence believe he was planning to use for a series of terror strikes across Europe.

One of his key objectives, it is believed was to kill 'un cagoulé', French for 'a hood', which is a term used to describe a member of the special police forces.

Among the items were an MP5 submachine gun, used by special forces soldiers around the world, an M-16 type automatic rifle and a Kalashnikov AK47 with folding stock and a pump action shotgun.

Alongside hundreds of rounds of ammunition Benladghem had kept a flak jacket with dozens of spare magazines, a helmet with attached night-vision goggles.

There were also vicious barbed staples for use in a range of anti personnel devices as well as food rations and medical equipment. Police had feared the apartment had been booby trapped.

A 30-year-old woman living at the address, believed to be Benladghem's partner, was arrested and charged with possessing the deadly arsenal.

Benladghem had trained as a 'para-commando' in the French Foreign Legion before he moved to Belgium in 2008. It was around that time that police believe he became radicalised.

He made several attempts to travel to Israel to fight in Gaza but was refused entry. Records show he received 150 calls to two cell phones from Gaza in February 2008. 

Benladghem travelled abroad frequently including trips to Norway, Italy, Switzerland and Syria. He had been issued an Indian visa but it had not been used.

Investigators are now trying to determine whether he was a 'Lone Wolf' or if he had accomplices or was linked to any established terrorist organisations.
