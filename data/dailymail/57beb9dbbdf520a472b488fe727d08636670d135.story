It's not often that a five-month-old is blessed with such an impressive head of hair, so when the parents of Pasha Chukfeh noticed their son's incredibly voluminous locks they took full advantage.

Ghaith and Sahar Hafeez, from Toronto, Canada, were so impressed by their son's hair that they couldn't resist experimenting with iconic styles.

Father Ghaith styles his five-month-old's hair every night after his bath and has snapped his boy rocking an array of quirky 'dos.

He pairs each hair style with a tongue-in-cheek name to match the look. Ranging from The Emo to The Side Part. Other more inventive styles include The Crazy Guy, The Mad Scientist, The Twirl and The Greasy Banker.

The IT manager then posted the funny photos on the social networking website Reddit and he was met by a huge response.

The photos received hundreds of comments from online fans who were amazed by the baby's amount of hair.

Ghaith says that he started posting the images after friends remarked on the astonishing amount of hair that Pasha has.

'People kept commenting on how much hair our baby son has, so naturally this was the next step.'

Ever since his birth, Pasha has been wowing people with his extraordinary hair. His parents said that directly following his delivery, the first words out of the doctor’s mouth were, 'Woah! He’s got a lot of hair!'

People comment on Pasha’s hair all the time. 'The most common thing we hear is, "Man, that kid has more hair that I do, and I’m 30!" or "My kid was bald until he was two!"', says Pasha's mother.

Ghaith wanted to find a way of documenting the hilarious results of his hair styling, so that he could show Pasha once he was older.

'The idea was born from bath time. I would make all kinds of water hair styles with some shampoo, and then we thought to ourselves "we need to make a collage out of this". He can't grow up and NOT know how great his hair truly is!'

Despite the vast range of hairstyles that Ghaith has created he says that Pasha isn't always as cooperative as he appears in the pictures. 

'He's a very social baby, most days he's in a good mood and loves the attention, other days may just have to be a write off, but that's the world of babies. You work around them.'
