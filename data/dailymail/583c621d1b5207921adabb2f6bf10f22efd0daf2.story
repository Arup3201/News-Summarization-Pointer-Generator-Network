Leadership: Spokesman Greg Aiello said the NFL is against the religious-rights bill and is closely watching its passage

The Arizona Super Bowl Host Committee has condemned a new bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay people based on religious beliefs, sparking fears next year's big game will be pulled from the state.

In a statement released today, the host committee flat-out denounced the controversial bill, saying it would 'deal a significant blow' to potential economic growth in Arizona.

Arizona is slated to host the 2015 Super Bowl at Glendaleâ€™s University of Phoenix Stadium, which could be worth up to half a billion dollars for the state.

'On that matter we have heard loud 
and clear from our various stakeholders that adoption of this 
legislation would not only run contrary to that goal but deal a 
significant blow to the state's economic growth potential. We do not 
support this legislation,' the committee said, according to USA Today.

Business groups are worried the National Football League championship game and its related events could face boycotts if Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signs the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, S.B. 1062.

However, the NFL has not yet expressed its view of the bill, only noting the league would be monitoring it.

'Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other improper standard,' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said.

'We are following the issue in Arizona and will continue to do so should the bill be signed into law, but will decline further comment at this time.'

The host committee has joined other high-profile companies such as Apple and American Airlines which have hit out at the bill.

Opponents claim it has the potential to allow Arizona businesses to refuse service to homosexual customers.

Business leaders including Phoenix Chamber of Commerce CEO Todd Sanders and Greater Phoenix Leadership CEO Tom Franz yesterday sent a letter urging Brewer to veto the 
legislation because they say it would expose businesses to a higher risk
 of lawsuits and hurt efforts to attract good workers.

'We are 
troubled by any legislation that could be interpreted to permit 
discrimination against a particular group of people in the marketplace,'
 the leaders said.

'The 
legislation is also already clearly having a negative effect on our 
tourism industry, one of the largest sectors of the economy. The bill 
could also harm job creation efforts and our ability to attract and 
retain talent.'

Supporters argue the bill is about protecting religious freedom, not about allowing discrimination, citing the case of a New Mexico photographer sued for refusing to take wedding pictures of a gay couple.

'This bill is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living out their faith,' bill sponsor, state GOP Sen. Steve Yarbrough, said.

Arizona's recent passing of the bill has made it the first American state to pass legislation allowing people and businesses to refuse to work with or serve gays if their religion forbids or disapproves of homosexuality.

The Democrat opposition called the proposal 'state-sanctioned discrimination' and an embarrassment and claimed that it would hurt the economy.

'This bill is about going after the rights of the LGBT community in Arizona,' said Representative Chad Campbell, the leader of the Democrat opposition. 'This is going to be horrible for our economy.'

If accepted, the bill will put the state back into the forefront of controversial law debate, four years after the national uproar it caused with an immigration crackdown.

Other states - Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma - have brought in religious legislation but Arizona is the only one to pass.

The bill allows any business, church or person to use the law as a defense in any action brought by the government or individual claiming discrimination.

The bill is backed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a social conservative group that opposes abortion and gay marriage. The group says the proposal is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law.

All but three Republicans in the House voted in favor of the bill. and the Senate passed it the day before.

In 2008, Arizona voted to ban same-sex marriage but there is no guarantee that the bill will pass as Republican Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar measure last year.

Republicans said it was simply an added protection for the faithful in the state who disapprove of gay marriage and want to be able to reject participating.
