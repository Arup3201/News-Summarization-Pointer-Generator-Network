From smart helmets to traffic detection systems, inventors are working to make cycling safer.

Now there’s a light-up jacket with built in indicators to make a biker’s intentions clearer to motorists.

The Visijax Commuter Jacket contains flashing LEDs on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm - so that other road users can clearly see when they're making a turn.

A light-up jacket with built in indicators (pictured) will go on sale this month. The Visijax Commuter Jacket contains flashing LEDs on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm - helping show other road users when they're making a turn

The smart jacket also contains a built-in light on the back to help boost riders' visibility.

It runs off a handy USB-charged battery pack and comes in two colours – black and neon yellow.

The jacket will go on sale later this month at Halfords, for £99 ($150).

‘Our customers told us that better safety products would encourage them to cycle more, and the illuminating Visijax Commuter Jacket will make it easier for commuters to be seen on the roads,’ said Halfords product manager Ross Hubbard said.

‘We know visibility can be a major barrier to cycling at this time of year - we want to help commuters to overcome these barriers and to encourage as many people as possible to cycle.

The jacket is not the only cycling gear to be invented with built-in indicators.

A Japanese firm called Doppelganger, has created gloves with LEDs inside that can be switched on via an attached button to let motorists know when wearers are planning on turning.

The lights can also be programmed to flash continuously to increase a cyclist's night-time visibility.

Launched in 2013, the $42 (£28) lights, which come with a pair of gloves, can also be attached to a favourite pair of gloves using Velcro. 

A design for a Dora helmet features light-up arrows down its side and would be controlled by a Bluetooth switch on the handlebars.

The helmet's LED indicators light up in yellow for indicators and red for brake lights. It is created by Hungarian designer Balazs Filczer.

Life is about to get easier for cyclists with the advent of vibrating handlebar devices and grips that buzz to tell riders which way to turn.

Called smrtGRiPS, the devices are designed to fit any bike and can be paired with a smartphone app to provide directions.

Engineers are attempting to launch their invention into production on crowdfunding site, Indiegogo.

smrtGRiPS are designed to fit any bike and can be paired with a smartphone app to provide directions. They vibrate to tell a cyclist when to turn

To fit the smrtGRiPS, a cyclist slots the devices inside the metal tube of the bike's handlebars and a rubber grip fits on top.

Before setting off, a cyclist will choose whether they would like audio as well as haptic - or vibrating - alerts in the dedicated app for Android and Apple phones, before entering the destination in their chosen mapping app.

They can then put their phone back into their pocket or bag and start cycling to get directions without looking at a screen, because the handlebars vibrate.

The company, based in Montreal, Canada, claims this makes cycling safer because cyclists can keep their eyes on the road instead of reading a map on a screen.

Either the left or right grip will vibrate, indicating which way to turn, or for traffic problems.

Vibrations intensify the closer cyclists get to a turning to make sure they select the right road at junctions.
