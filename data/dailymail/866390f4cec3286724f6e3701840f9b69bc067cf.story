Motorway service stations are known to charge over the odds for fast food, safe in the knowledge that they are the only option for hungry drivers.

But it’s not just burgers for which you pay more on a long car journey, according to a survey.

A single banana can cost as much as 75p at a service station  – more than six times the supermarket price of around 12p.

The Norton Canes service station on the M6 in Staffordshire, where a survey found a banana cost 75p

The price of a banana at Norton Canes Roachef is six times as much the supermarket price of a single banana, which is around 12p

The Which? survey found the cost of a banana at motorway shops ranged from 50p at the M40’s Cherwell Valley Moto near Oxford, to 75p at the Norton Canes Roadchef on the M6 toll in Staffordshire.

Other items with a heavy mark-up included a bottle of water costing £1.59 at Fleet Welcome Break on the M3 in Hampshire. Similar bottles in supermarkets cost between 27p and 38p.

The most expensive cheese sandwich was also at Fleet, costing £3.75, while its supermarket equivalent was priced at just 85p.

The survey also revealed the nation's best and worst motorway service stations, which reveal stark differences in the quality of food and facilities at 26 of the country's biggest rest stops.

Tebay, off the M6 in Cumbria, has been confirmed as the nation’s favourite, winning praise for its fresh local meat and produce, its hearty food and its spotless toilets.

A banana at Cherwell Valley services on the M40 in Oxford only costs 50p, 25p cheaper than at Norton Canes, according to research from Which?

Run by a family owned company, it was opened by Prince Charles in 1972 and could not be further from the big chains which pepper the nation’s motorways with their plastic fast food, high prices and grim loos.

Such is the quality of its produce, pies, cheeses and locally prepared food that it has been described as the Harrods Food Hall of the north, finding fame as a tourist destination in itself.

No burgers and plastic wrapped sandwiches for Tebay, rather traditional favourites such as hot pot and steak-and-kidney pie.

Compare that with Charnock Richard, just 64 miles south down the M6, which is named as the worst of the roadside service stations, a brutal concrete legacy of the 1960s where the food options include Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Subway.

Owned by the Welcome Break group, it managed a customer score of just 39 per cent, which compares to the 90 per cent for Tebay.

Tebay is the creation of John and Barbara Dunning who faced the nightmare news 45 years ago that the new M6 would rip through their peaceful Cumbrian cattle farm.

Rather than simply giving in to the march of progress, they chose to work with the developers and opened their own motorway service station.

Today its farm shop stocks products from over 70 local suppliers and many others from the neighbouring counties.

There are two butchery counters, which sell meat direct from the family farm, while there is a broad range of pies, everything from duck, plum and Armagnac to steak and kidney.

Visitors can order food up to 24 hours in advance, with many travellers choosing to stock up on farmhouse cheeses, charcuterie and a surprisingly large range of scotch eggs. Award-winning bread is also available.

In May this year, the family opened a second service station off the northbound carriageway of the M5 at Gloucester, while they recently secured funding of £27million to do the same on the southbound.

The template for Tebay has been reproduced at the new site with a farm shop that stocks products from 130 suppliers in the immediate 30-mile radius.

A Which? spokesman said: ‘The family-run business is slightly different from usual service stations as it sells home-grown and local produce in its farm shop and restaurant.

‘It was the only location to get a full five-star rating and it achieved this feat in both food quality and toilet cleanliness.’

The reviews of Charnock Richard, which is less than a one hour drive away in Lancashire, are distinctly less glowing.

It was the first service area to open on the M6 in 1963, and like other services from its time, the restaurant was located in a building on the concrete bridge which spanned the carriageway.

Today customers at KFC and Burger King can amuse themselves with a bird’s eye view of the trucks, white vans and private cars that thunder along the road beneath their feet.

Service station expert, Mark Goodge, of the website motorwayservices.info, said: ‘Charnock Richard is on a very busy part of the motorway, but it’s not the largest of motorway service areas (MSAs) and so tends to get excessively crowded.

‘And, like a lot of the Burger King and KFC franchises at MSAs, it tends to be under-staffed, which means long queues at peak times and lack of cleaning.

‘It was the first MSA to open on the M6 in July 1963, and it’s built to a design which was fashionable at the time but hasn’t kept pace with changes in usage patterns and customer demand since then.

‘Lots of piecemeal additions to it over the years mean that the building is cramped and awkward to navigate inside. The building is ugly, and although it’s in a mainly rural location it makes no use of that at all.

Meanwhile Charnock Richard services on the M6 in Lancashire, which was the first of its kind to open in 1963, has been named the worst

‘Instead, it’s screened off from the outside world by high hedges and fences all round. That, of course, is mainly to hide it from local residents, but it gives the entire site a claustrophobic feel.’

Mr Goodge said he had stayed at a motel on the site mainly to see if it is as bad as its reputation. ‘I have to say that I wouldn’t use it again unless I was desperate,’ he said.

He praised Tebay saying it had ‘managed to avoid most of the perceived issues with corporate blandness that often applies to the main operators’.

He added: ‘It’s also got some nice individual tweaks, like a farm shop on site, as well as a caravan site which is very useful for holidaymakers wanting an overnight stop on the way to Scotland. And it has the huge benefit of being located in a beautiful part of the countryside, which the operators have taken full advantage of in the design.

‘I’m not convinced that the food itself is hugely better - or cheaper - than anywhere else, however the overall ambience of the site is certainly a lot nicer than the typical motorway service station. There aren’t many other places on the motorway where you can watch ducks on the lake, with the Cumbrian hills in the background, while you eat your lunch.’

The other service stations to make the top five were Wetherby on A1(M) with a score of 69 per cent; Cobham on the M25 at 67 per cent; Peterborough, on the A1(M) at 61 per cent; and Hopwood Park, on the M42 near Birmingham at 59 per cent.
