In a stadium holding no fans, Manchester City will face a player who made little noise during an 18-month spell at rivals United.

But Zoran Tosic has proved he is worth shouting about since establishing himself at CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini, in desperate need of victory, should be wary of the danger he poses.

Tosic joined United aged 21 in January 2009 when Sir Alex Ferguson agreed to pay Partizan Belgrade £7million. He arrived as an exciting talent having scored 18 goals in 61 games for one of the biggest teams in his native Serbia.

But his career at Old Trafford never really sparked into life. There were only five appearances, all from the bench, totaling 79 minutes in a United shirt. 

Tosic made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup

He should get more in CSKA’s Champions League clash against City at the Arena Khimki alone.

There were promising spells for United’s reserve team but the Premier League was initially too great a step up. Cristiano Ronaldo also presented a sizeable blockade to first-team progression.

Having made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup, Tosic went on loan to Cologne in Germany. 

He enjoyed his time so much he wanted regular football immediately.

When that was not on offer at United, he decided to leave for CSKA. He has been a tremendous success. 

Now into his fifth season, he has scored 33 goals in 150 games and is a trickery winger of great threat to City’s defence.

Tosic is reveling in his role as a key figure in CSKA’s side, but admits to feeling he may have left United too soon.

‘It all happened really quickly as I played for just 18 months with Partizan Belgrade,’ Tosic said. 

‘We won the league and the cup and there was a period when it seemed like I was scoring in every match.

‘It was at that point I signed for Manchester United. It was such an exciting moment to go there and to meet Sir Alex.

‘I had grown up as a United fan so to be working for the man who had brought so much success to the club was just unbelievable. 

‘However, there is a big difference between the Serbian and English league and when I arrived in Manchester I discovered I was not yet ready for that level.

‘I spoke with Sir Alex many times and he kept telling me I had quality and just had to keep working hard. But I wanted to play more games so went to Cologne in Germany on loan and had a great six months there.

‘When I came back to Manchester I was expecting to play more games for United but it didn’t happen. In the end I wasn’t sure I was going to get the chance I felt I deserved so decided to change club.

‘Even now I am always thinking about that moment. Maybe I shouldn’t have been so quick and should have worked longer to show Sir Alex.

‘Maybe I should have stayed and fought for my place. This was Man United after all.’
