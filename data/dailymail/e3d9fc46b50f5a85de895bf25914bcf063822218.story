'No place in politics today': Andy Newman, pictured, has been attacked after paying tribute to Stalin in articles

‘Red’ Ed Miliband is keen to play down suggestions that Labour has ‘lurched to the Left’ under his leadership.

But the message doesn’t seem to have reached leafy Chippenham, where the party has just selected an apologist for Stalin as its candidate for the next General Election.

At first glance, Andy Newman would appear to be a good fit with the affluent Wiltshire seat, held by Liberal Democrat Duncan Hames.

Educated at a private school and Oxford University, Mr Newman’s CV bears the hallmarks of a modern Labour politician.

However, a delve into some of his recent writings suggests the union official is determined to keep the Red Flag flying over the West Country.

He has called the Berlin Wall ‘a great success’ and praised the ‘significant improvement in working class living standards’ during Stalin’s Great Terror.

He described the attacks on Pearl Harbour as the ‘opening salvo in a war between two rival imperialisms’ – equating America with wartime Japan under Emperor Hirohito – and branded the Dalai Lama a ‘figurehead for slavery’.

In the run-up to his selection last month, the telecoms engineer set out some of his uncompromising beliefs in articles in ultra-left-wing publications.

Paying tribute to Stalin’s character, whose brutal dictatorship led to the deaths of millions of citizens, he wrote earlier this year: ‘We should recognise how Stalin was the creature of his times; and not alone in culpability.

‘What is more, the character of Stalin, who almost through a feat of sheer will industrialised and militarised the USSR to defend itself against the Nazi threat, was also the character that ruthlessly regarded people as expendable. It did give Stalin the attributes needed to be a great war leader’.

And in 2009, Mr Newman, who is the local branch secretary of the GMB union, used a piece in Socialist Unity to put a positive gloss on the tyrant’s rule.

'Shocking:' Mr Newman wrote of the rule of Joseph Stalin, right, in glowing terms

Describing him in apparently respectful terms as ‘the Stalin’, he wrote: ‘Free market capitalism had seen worldwide depression in the 1930s and had led to fascism and war.

'Meanwhile the USSR’s economy had achieved staggering success in the same period, including a significant improvement in working class living standards, despite the Stalin’s terror’.

In the same article, he wrote warmly of the Berlin Wall: ‘If we set to one side the issue of personal liberty, the [Berlin] wall was a great success.’

In other writings he has described modern Britain as a ‘marriage’ between England, Wales and Scotland which is ‘based on shared guilt’, with the ‘bloodstains of the British Empire soaked equally into the souls of the English, Welsh and Scots’.

He has also opposed Tibetan resistance to the socialist Chinese ‘hegemonic state sector’, dismissing the Dalai Lama as a ‘feudal figurehead’ of the ‘slavery and barbarism’ in Tibet’s past.

Last night, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Newman’s ‘grossly offensive beliefs will shock ordinary people up and down the country’ and called for his deselection.

He added: ‘Suggestions that the Berlin Wall was a good thing and Stalin was a great leader have no place in politics today – the Labour Party must act immediately and sack this throwback.’

A Labour spokesman said: ‘This is a desperate smear attempt by the Tories. Labour are concentrating on addressing the cost-of-living crisis.’
