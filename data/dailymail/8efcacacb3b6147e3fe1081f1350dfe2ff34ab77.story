The father of a Florida teen accused of ruthlessly murdering two people during a month-long shooting spree now faces felony charges for purchasing the gun used in the slayings for his 15-year-old son and allowing him access to the weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

According to authorities, Lothar Schafer took his son to the Mega Gun and Armory gun shop in Kissimme in June - the day before the shootings began - and bought him a .45 caliber, High Point carbine rifle.

'The rifle was used in multiple shooting incidents in Osceola County...including in the shooting death of 17-year-old David Guerrero,' a police statement said.

Negligence: Lothar Schafer faces felony charges for supplying his 15-year-old son with the gun police say he used to murder two people

Schafer said he bought the boy the weapon - as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition - because he was 'having problems with unidentified subjects in Poinciana, Florida,' according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Orlando Sentinel.

Schafer's son, Konrad Schafer, is being tried as an adult for allegedly murdering Guerrero and University of Central Florida student Eric Roopnarine, as well as firing dozens of live rounds at houses and cars during late-night joyrides with his alleged accomplices.

Guerrero was fatally shot as he waited at a bus stop on June 26.

'[Schafer] thought it would be fun to shoot Mr Guerrero,' Kissimmee Police Chief Lee Massie said. 'This is the type of individuals we put in jail today.'

About a week later, on July 3, Schafer and the three other suspects - Victoria Rios, 17; David Damus, 20; and Juan Muriel, 20 - forced their way into a home belonging to 22-year-old Eric Roopnarine, police said.

The suspects had allegedly tricked Roopnarine into thinking he was going to have sex with Victoria Rios, a runaway, when they entered his home.

Once inside, Damus shot Roopnarine in the head with Schafer's gun and Schafer slit the man's throat.

The suspects targeted Roopnarine because they believed he had money, according to police.

Konrad Schafer told police that he took the gun out of his father's house on a regular basis - even after he was told not to.

'Lothar learned of one of Konrad's shootings and took the firearm away from him,' the affidavit stated. 'However, Konrad was able to access it again and continue to commit shootings with it. â€¦ Konrad admitted to retrieving the firearm from Lothar's residence, and using it to commit multiple shootings as well as the murder of David Guerrero.'

Police said Schafer acquired this .45-caliber rifle from his father. The elder Schafer said he purchased the firearm for personal protection

Because of his alleged negligence, Lothar Schafer faces a felony charge of culpable negligence for allegedly leaving a loaded firearm within easy access of a minor who uses it to injure or kill someone. Additionally, he faces a misdemeanor charge of allowing unlawful possession of a firearm.

The younger Schafer, and his three co-defendants, each have been charged with first-degree murder.

Schafer's trial is scheduled to begin on December 2.
