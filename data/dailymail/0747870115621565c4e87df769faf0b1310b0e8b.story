Thousands of dollars worth of jewelry was stolen from a Manhattan store that includes Beyonce and Selena Gomez among its A-list clients.

The robbery occurred on Friday afternoon at Margo Manhattan on Madison Avenue, the New York Daily News reports.

The robber reportedly posed as a customer and was buzzed inside by manager Marcy Imber, who was the only employee working at the time. Once inside, the man asked to see a gold bracelet up close - before he attempted to tie her up.

The man tried to force Imber into a back room and tie her using gift wrap ribbons, according to The New York Post.

He then reportedly tried using a key to open jewelry cases before noticing an open safe in the back room and emptying its contents.

The missing jewelry includes a pendant and chain that Beyonce wore in her 'Blow' music video, which retails for $2150 on Manhattan's website.

'Passion Rings' made for Selena Gomez were also stolen, according to the Post. They retail for $510 each.

The thief reportedly even stole Imber's purse and credit cards during the robbery, according to CBS.

The suspect is a black man in his 30s, the Post says.

The Daily News reports that the suspect fled when another store employee arrived - while the man tried to choke Imber.

'Luckily, she opened the door or otherwise the guy could have killed her,' store owner Margo Manhattan told the paper. 'â€œHe was trying to choke her and had tied her up.'

She added that police were looking at surveillance footage. The suspect remains at large.
