Dundee United have accepted a £3million bid from Sporting Lisbon for superkid Ryan Gauld.

The 18-year-old is set to fly out for talks with the Portuguese giants and the deal is expected to be concluded later this week.

The
 teenage midfielder became known as “Baby Messi” for his dazzling 
dribbling and low centre of gravity as he tormented Scottish defences 
when he burst onto the scene last season as United finished fourth in 
the Scottish Premiership and reached the Scottish Cup Final.

Over the past year, Gauld, from 
Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, has been scouted by Real Madrid, Roma, 
Manchester United and Arsenal.

And while Dundee United were not under pressure to sell they felt unable to turn down a bid of that size for a teenager.

Last
 season, the down-to-earth Gauld played down comparisons with the 
Argentinian great but revealed he would love to play abroad one day 
rather than grace the English Premier League.

‘The comparison to Messi is quite laughable, but it is good to read,’ he said.

‘I
 look up to Messi because he’s the best in the world. Every young boy 
should be watching and trying to emulate him in training. Don’t be an 
ordinary person, go and try something special.

‘Growing
 up, I watched the Spanish Leagues and prefer that style. Getting the 
ball down and being patient with the build-up play. In England, it’s 
maybe more direct. If you are a winger, you are expected to take on a 
full-back and get a cross in. Abroad, you can turn out, keep the ball 
and just keep the attack going. You also see players who are smaller in 
stature.

‘In England, it’s 
more athletes. Being a smaller guy, I need to think about what’s best 
for me and what’s best around me and I think being abroad is the best 
culture of football for me.”

Gauld
 and his close friend, the United defender John Souttar – who was the 
subject of a failed £600,000 bid by Sunderland last season - were both 
coached intensively as kids by Ian Cathro at his respected Dundee soccer
 clinics.

When Cathro was 
promoted by then-United boss Craig Levein to head of the Tanandice youth
 academy at the age of 22, he fast-tracked the pair for future stardom 
before the highly-rated Cathro quit his post with the SFA for a role in 
the backroom staff at Portuguese Premeira Liga club Rio Ave.

It
 seems likely Cathro will have given a glowing recommendation about 
Gauld to Sporting Lisbon when they were doing background checks on the 
young Scot.

Cathro said recently he was in in no doubt that Gauld’s ability would enable him to succeed on the continent.

‘His movement, awareness and technical ability are all  outstanding,’ Cathro said.

‘He is already playing in a way that can break down European teams and allow him to play in European leagues.'

Now Gauld looks set to seal a stunning move to Sporting Lisbon.
