For one Seattle woman, a mind-blowing orgasm sent her to heaven - and then to the emergency room.

Liz had just had sex with her partner Eric, but well after he climbed out of bed, Liz was hitting new peaks of pleasure.

About an hour into her epic climax, Liz started to panic. By the second hour, the panting woman was rushed to hospital where medical staff thought she was in labor.

Liz's orgasm lasted for over three hours before she finally found relief.

The young couple shared their bizarre story during 
last night's TLC show 'Sex Sent Me to the ER'.

Liz, who didn't give her last name, recounted how she tried everything from jumping to drinking to shake the ache.

'I started hopping up and down to see if that would do anything,' Liz said about her first frenzied hour.

'I started trying to drink wine to see if that would calm down my system. I tried just about every possible thing I could do to stop having an orgasm.'

Eric drove his partner to the ER, where, he recalled, some people stared and shared their insights.

'As much of a relief as it was to have her in the hospital, now there were eyes on me and I was still feeling very tense and uptight and uncertain about what was going on and what was going to happen,' Eric said.

Liz's orgasm continued for another hour in the hospital before it finally waned.

Last night's episode also included the painfully awkward tales of a couple injured during sex in a janitor's closet and a man who fell three stories naked.
