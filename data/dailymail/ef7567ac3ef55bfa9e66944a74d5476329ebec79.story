A 17-year-old boy who assaulted another teenager using the boy’s own crutches has been let off with a warning by the Crown Prosecution Service.

Angus Whittall, 15, suffered multiple facial injuries after he was viciously attacked walking on a quiet country lane near his home in Great Oxendon, Northamptonshire.

Despite identifying his attacker, who is known to the police, Angus and his family were told it was ‘not in the public interest’ to prosecute the 17-year-old.

Hospitalised: Angus was on crutches following a knee surgery when the 17-year-old used them to beat him up, leaving him with horrific facial injuries

Angus needed 12 stitches for a gash in 
his mouth and suffered severe bruising to his head and neck from the 
unprovoked July attack.

Police arrested the boy and charged 
him with actual bodily harm, but weeks before he was due to appear in 
court, the CPS refused to prosecute.

Angus’ parents today slammed the decision, saying they had ‘lost faith in the justice system.’

Battered: Angus Whittall, 15, after the brutal attack

Company director Peter, 47, said: ‘I 
don’t know how somebody known to police can cause such nasty injuries 
and escape punishment.

‘We are appalled that this has been allowed to happen.

‘We were told it wasn’t in the public interest to haul him before the courts. It’s baffling.’

Angus
was on crutches, following a knee operation, when the boy attacked him 
as he walked along a country lane on July 29 this year.

Completely
unprovoked, the youth punched Angus before beating him around the head 
with his crutches and then leaving him bleeding on the ground.

Mr
Whittall, questioning both the CPS and the police, who took a month to 
arrest the 17-year-old, said if the brutal attack 'isn't cause for legal
action - what is?’

He added: ‘We were told it wasn’t in the public interest to haul him before the courts. It’s baffling.’

Angus’ mother Cathy, 46, a recruitment consultant, fumed: ‘We were all so disappointed.

‘When my son heard that the yob had escaped with a slap on the wrists he just started shaking his head.

‘Now that his attacker has got away with it, he could easily do it again to someone else.

‘It was a completely unprovoked attack and there is nothing to stop him doing it again if he knows he will get away with it.’

Scene: Blood can be seen on the road in Great Oxenden where the assault took place in July this year

Police arrested the perpetrator from 
Rothwell, Northamptonshire at the end of August and had been due to face
an assault charge in youth court at Kettering Magistrates on September 
7.

Evidence: Angus' blood spattered trousers

However, when the CPS ruled they would not be seeking a prosecution and referred the case back to the police.

Northamptonshire Police decided to give the teenager a slap on the wrist.

A spokesman for CPS East Midlands said yesterday: ‘A senior crown prosecutor has reviewed all the facts in this case, including the aggravating and mitigating factors.

‘The circumstances behind this assault fit the national criteria for a final warning, which has now been formally administered by a police officer.

‘Reprimands and warnings are often used as a method of addressing the behaviour of young people with the intervention of the local youth offending team.

‘The views of the victim and his family have been taken into account in reaching this decision.'

A Northamptonshire Police spokesman added: ‘Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, it was determined that he receive a final warning, rather than appear before the court.’
