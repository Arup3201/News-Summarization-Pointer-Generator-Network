A teenager born without arms who plays guitar with his feet has become an Internet sensation after a video of his musical prowess hit YouTube earlier in the summer.

George Dennehy, 18, uploaded his performance of The Goo Goo Dolls song Iris to the video-sharing website in June. It has so far attracted just under half a million hits.

But that almost pales into insignificance compared to what happened next.

Born without arms: Mr Dennehy even warmed up for the band by playing a few songs before their set

Impressed by Mr Dennehy's YouTube 
performance, Goo Goo Dolls drummer Mike Malinin invited the teenager to 
join the band onstage at Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, last 
week.

He told Lehigh Valley Live: 'We 
sound-checked with him to make sure he knows how to play the song. I 
think he knows it better than we do.'

Mr Dennehy, from Ashland, Virginia, 
even warmed up for the band by playing a few songs before their set, 
including a cover of Pink's Perfect.

He later took to the stage for a run-through of Iris with the Goo Goo Dolls in front of an ecstatic crowd.

Inspiring: When he first uploaded the video of his performance of Iris at Richmond's Got Talent to YouTube, it only attracted a few hits

The 2012 winner of the Virginia-based
Richmondâ€™s Got Talent, Mr Dennehy was adopted by his U.S. family at the
age of one and started playing the cello at age eight.

He is the only known person in the 
world who can play classical string music with his feet, and he also 
plays electric bass and piano.

When he first uploaded the video of his performance of Iris at Richmond's Got Talent to YouTube, it only attracted a few hits.

But after Mr Dennehy created a page on Reddit, viewing figures shot through the roof.
