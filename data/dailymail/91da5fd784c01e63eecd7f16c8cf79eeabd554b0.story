It was not a rigid formation in attack for United. In particular Shinji Kagawa drifted from the left into the middle and was a threat when on the ball.

Danny Welbeck would go out wide and his pace scared Bayern at times. Wayne Rooney would drop back if he needed to.

It was in general a good tempo from United and what Moyes must have expected when he took over this job. It was more like the United of old, and for the first 60 minutes as good a performance as any this season given the calibre of opponent they were up against.

This was the all-conquering Bayern Munich. Maybe United do not need the massive overhaul that has been suggested. They looked a good side. It was a brave fight.

Patrice Evra’s goal was a thunderbolt struck because he sensed blood at the start of the second half. Bayern responded like champions and it was Evra who allowed Mario Mandzukic to steal in for his header.

I was very impressed with Chris Smalling, there now looks to be a future for him at centre-half; which is a positive from an England point of view. It was a big call by David Moyes to play Smalling in place of Rio Ferdinand but it worked.

He looked dominant in the air – and beat Thomas Muller to a commanding header early on – and also coped well in one-on-ones with Franck Ribery when dragged to the wing. He was mobile and used the ball well.

Plus point: Phil Jones (centre) has shown promise at right back this season

Phil Jones was another plus point at right back. Moyes will have to play at least one of the youngsters, perhaps both, with Nemanja Vidic and Ferdinand leaving in the summer. This will have been an important experience for both of them and given them confidence.

Conversely, Jerome Boateng and Dante did not look comfortable at times in possession. Pep Guardiola likes to play out from the back but when questioned by United’s high pressing they would often go back to Manuel Neuer.

I was disappointed with Bayern Munich, it was not as difficult for Manchester United as we would have expected. Usually in wide positions they have carousel of players and the full-backs bomb forward.

But David Alaba and Philipp Lahm played very central, they came right in to central midfield. It was underlapping rather than overlapping. That made it easier for United to work out who should be picking up who.

Game-changer: The introduction of Rafinha (left) gave Bayern added impetus and gave them better shape

It might be because Pep Guardiola wanted Lahm on ball more often, and it also meant Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller could push further forwards. But instead they looked ordinary; it just didn’t work.

It’s a system that would drive someone like Arjen Robben mad. He loves short passes with his full-back to cut in and find space in dangerous areas, but there was little chance of that. There was no-one running down the wings to create width. It seemed a case of Guardiola over-tinkering.

When Rafinha came on to provide width, Bayern looked a different side.
