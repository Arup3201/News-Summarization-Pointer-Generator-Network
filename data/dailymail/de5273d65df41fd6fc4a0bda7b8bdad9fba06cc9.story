Britain will lead a new global clampdown on ‘aggressive’ tax avoiders, David Cameron vowed today.

The Prime Minister said customers were fed up with big firms who do not pay their way,

In an apparent swipe at Starbucks which failed to pay corporation tax in the UK for three years, he told world leaders and business bosses at the World Economic Forum in Davos to: ‘Wake up and smell the coffee.’

David Cameron used a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos to reveal the G8 would target tax avoiders who refuse to pay their way

Mr Cameron said he would use the UK's G8 presidency in 2013 to take on ‘cowboy’ firms who avoid tax, driving up bills for those who play by the rules and harming public services.

The government has been under pressure to take action after a public backlash against firms including Starbucks, Amazon and Google who report multi-million pound revenues in the UK but pay little or no tax.

Mr Cameron said: ‘After years of abuse, people across the planet are calling for more action and most importantly, there is gathering political will to actually do something about it.

He said the G8 – consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US – would ‘drive a more serious debate on tax evasion and avoidance.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg questioned the need for the PM to travel to Davos, claiming it was 'debatable' that anything is achieved. 

But challenging the audience of some of 
the world’s biggest companies, Mr Cameron warned: ‘There's nothing wrong
with sensible tax planning, and there are some things governments want 
people to do that reduce tax bills, such as investing in pensions, 
start-up businesses or charities.

‘But some forms of avoidance have 
become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical
issues and it's time to call for more responsibility and for 
governments to act accordingly.’

Mr Cameron later met Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Davos, to discuss his plans for the UK presidency of the G8

David Cameron was today was branded 'Europe's Scaredy-cat' in an editorial by the German news magazine Spiegel over his plans for an EU referendum.

In an online piece published today, it was claimed the PM’s pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 was driven by ‘fear’.

‘Fear of his party, fear of voters, and fear of the EU itself, which he neither fully understands nor has ever really been interested in,’ it said.It claims his long-awaited speech on Europe was ‘boring’ and was ‘an attempt to shake off a troublesome issue by postponing it to a later date’.

‘He wants Europe to be a free trade zone with beach access. He missed an opportunity on Wednesday to haul Britain back to the centre of Europe.

‘Apart from vague demands like competitiveness, flexibility and fairness, he has no idea how the EU should develop. ‘His thinking on Europe is indecisive and chained to the present.

'What Europe witnessed on Wednesday was a speech delivered by a politician prone to knee-jerk reactions who lacks values or a vision. He lacks gravity. Cameron floats above Europe like an astronaut.’

The PM defended the idea of Tories forcing firms to pay more tax.

’I'm a low-tax Conservative, but I'm not a companies-should-pay-no-tax Conservative. Individuals and businesses must pay their fair share,’ he said.

‘Any businesses who think that they can carry on dodging that fair share or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bill right down - well, they need to wake up and smell the coffee because the public who buy from them have had enough.’

Poor business practices not only deprive the public sector of the revenue it needs to fund essential services, but also harm responsible firms, he said.

‘When one company doesn't pay the taxes they owe, then other companies end up paying more," said Mr Cameron.

‘When some cowboys play the system, all businesses suffer the fall-out to their reputation.

‘That's why it's not just those in the NGOs who have been lobbying my Government on these issues, it's those in the high-rises of the City of London - bankers, lawyers, senior figures in finance.

‘They've told us to pursue this agenda hard, and that's what we're going to do.’

Barbara Stocking, Oxfam Chief Executive, said: 'There can be no moral justification for companies wriggling out of paying their fair share to society.'

But Miles Dean, founder of Milestone International Tax Partners, said: 'Unless there is a uniform tax regime with a uniform tax rate and uniform accounting policy globally, David Cameron is banging his head against a brick wall.'

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said global efforts to tackle avoidance need to be matched by 'tougher action' domestically. 'The tens of billions of pounds raised would be a fairer and more effective way to tackle budget deficits than endless self-defeating austerity,' she added.

John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: 'The majority of businesses pay the right amount of tax, and for the small minority which do not, times are getting tougher, and rightly so.

'The CBI does not condone highly abusive avoidance schemes which serve no commercial purpose other than the minimisation of tax, even if they are legal.

'In some cases the tax system is lagging behind commercial reality, particularly around the taxation of the digital economy and transfer pricing. As the Prime Minister highlights, the UK needs to work together with other countries, including the G8, to change the rules where appropriate, so that they are fit for the global business age.'
