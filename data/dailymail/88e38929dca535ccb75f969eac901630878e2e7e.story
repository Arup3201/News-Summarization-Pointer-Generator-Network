An Australian family have given up their life in the suburbs and instead moved halfway across the world to take on an enormous and unusual task.

Karina and Craig Waters purchased the Chateau de Gudanes in 2013, nestled into the hillside on a ledge overlooking the Midi- Pyrénées in the south of France.

Built in the mid-eighteenth century, the sprawling property was designed by Parisian architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel and originally owned by an influential member of Toulouse Parliament.

This stunning French chateau is being restored by an Australian family

Karina and Craig Waters bought the Chateau de Gudanes in 2013, and began restorations last November

Spiral staircases which lead to some of the many levels in the house are dotted throughout

The Chateau's website states the building was created for: 'Louis Gaspard de Sales, Marquis de Gudanes. Gaspard, also known as the "King of the Pyrénées", (who) was an influential member of the Toulouse Parliament, and ironmster of the Ariége' in the 1700s.

On social media the history of the spectacular 94-room property has also been well documented.

'This Class 1 Historic Monument was designed by Parisian architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel, famous for his neoclassical, architectural symmetry, including the Le Petit Trianon and Place de la Concorde,' one entry reads.

The property also features a magnificent-sized pool with views of the mountains

There are dozens of rooms in the sprawling property with original brickwork still visible

The Waters left their hometown of Perth to take on the mammoth challenge

The have found some friendly foals who often roam the grounds of the romantic property 

'Now this sleeping beauty is being reawakened by an Australian family, as they start their restoration, giving back the love it deserves, and unravelling the spirit of the past. Opening the door to a world of wonder, both real and imagined.'

Since November last year the Waters have been restoring the huge mansion, which was on the market for four years before it was purchased by the Perth-based family.

Photographs posted to their website and Facebook page show the progress of the historic chateau, which was half in ruins when it came into its current owners hands.

The family have enlisted help in tackling the massive restoration

Spiral staircases lead down into many of the room in the chateau

Spectacularly high ceilings and original details on the walls still exist in the house

Spiraling staircases, dozens of rooms, spectacularly high ceilings and original details on the walls of the property are some of it's most impressive features.

A magnificent pool out the back, the stunning setting and original brickwork, paintings and architecture plus friendly animals which roam the ground only add to the wonder.

The Waters hope in the near future to have a running cafe and tours of the stunning rooms, with their impossibly high ceilings and intricate detail dating back centuries.

Looking ahead to 2016, the Waters aim to have accommodation, a gift shop, spaces for weddings and other functions, plus the ability to host local music festivals, fetes, conferences and other events at the chateau.

The detail in this keyhole could date back as far as the eighteenth century

Original stone walls still exist around the chateau

Some parts of the property needed more work than others, like this staircase covered in rubble

As for the legacy of the newly restored chateau when 'she' is finished, the Waters are hoping the beautiful building which sits between snow-capped mountains in the winter will live on.

'The Chateau won’t be a pretentious museum piece, but rather, a place to visit, reconnect with the earth and people, and restore the senses, just like she herself has been restored,' their website reads.

'It won’t be about overcrowding the walls with paintings or overflowing the floors with furnishings, but will be relatively minimalistic - a place to simply rest, breathe and enjoy the calm.'

Meantime another Australian family are currently undertaking a very similar expedition, recently dropping everything to move to the French countryside.

The Bromley family, from Mosman in Sydney's northern beaches, have taken it upon themselves to restore a romantic 14th century French chateau to its former glory and share it with romantics everywhere by transforming it into an affordable boutique hotel. 

In winter snow is visible on the surrounding mountains 

The Waters hope to turn the stunning chateau into a place where people can visit or stay

They said: 'It won’t be about overcrowding the walls with paintings or overflowing the floors with furnishings, but will be relatively minimalistic - a place to simply rest, breathe and enjoy the calm.'
