A scientist has 'remixed' his version of the sound of the big bang in light of detailed new data gathered by a multi-million pound space probe.

Information beamed back from the European Space Agency's Â£515m Planck space telescope has already seen physicists revise their estimates of the age of the universe.

Now one professor has used the Planck data to create an updated, 'high fidelity' rendition of the sound of the early development of the universe more than 13billion years ago.

John Cramer, a professor emeritus of the University of Washington, first created an audio version of the big bang using data from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy ten years ago.

Professor Cramer has now used the better quality Planck readings to create a new rendition.

'The new frequency spectrum goes to much higher frequencies than did the WMAP analysis, and therefore offers a more 'high-fidelity' rendition of the sound of the Big Bang,' the professor explained on his website.

The physicist used the Planck mission analysis of the cosmic microwave background - radiation from around 400,000 years after the start of the universe - which turns the temperature variations of the CMB into angular frequency components or 'multipoles'.

Professor Cramer pointed out that the actual big bang frequencies were far too low to have been heard by the human ear, so he scaled them up by a 'huge factor' for his simulation, which represents the first 760,000 years of the universe.

Last month the European Space Agency unveiled a portrait of the infant universe based upon the first 15 and a half months of data from the Planck space telescope.

The data also set a new value for the rate at which the universe is expanding today, indicating that the age of the universe is 13.82billion years - 80million years older than previously thought.

'High-fidelity': The Planck data goes to much higher frequencies than the old WMAP analysis, the professor said
