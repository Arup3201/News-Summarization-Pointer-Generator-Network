Ice cool Tory MP Sajid Javid does not seem the romantic type. Number crunching is his skill.

When his comprehensive school head tried to ban him from taking O-level maths, he kicked up a fuss – and passed with flying colours. It paid off.

Javid made a pile in the City, quit by the time he was 40 and last year – just three years after entering the Commons – became Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the most senior Minister outside the Cabinet.

His meteoric rise includes:

Ambitious Javid seems certain to win Cabinet promotion in the next reshuffle – with some tipping the  Conservatives’ first British-Pakistani MP as a future leader.

But scratch the steely surface and there is a softer side to Bromsgrove MP Javid, 44, as he showed when he wooed wife and childhood sweetheart Laura as teenagers in Bristol.

‘I got a summer job at the local Commercial Union insurance company and she sat opposite. We shared a stapler. Love over a stapler!’ he laughs.

‘I was besotted. Every time I went to get the stapler I’d touch a finger, then another finger – and there was no objection – eventually I managed to ask her if she would come to the sandwich shop with me. I’ve never looked back.’

He travelled the globe, made his fortune and returned to marry his English rose Laura, his only serious girlfriend.

There is an Old World courtliness about it. Javid worked for Chase Manhattan Bank in the US in the 1990s, the era of The Wolf Of Wall Street excesses, but there any resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio’s licentious Jordan Belfort ends – hardly surprising when Javid recalled his upbringing as we met at his Treasury office overlooking London’s St James’s Park.

His dad, Abdul, came to Britain from Pakistan in 1961 with just £1 in his pocket and settled in Rochdale, where Javid, one of five brothers, was born.

Abdul’s readiness to work all hours as a bus driver earned him the nickname ‘Mr Night and Day’.

When Sajid was four, his dad took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it.

‘Three brothers were in one bedroom and myself and a younger brother were with my parents in the other.’

They lived in Stapleton Road, described recently as ‘Britain’s worst street, a lawless hellhole where murder, rape, shootings, drug-pushing, prostitution, knifings and violent robbery are commonplace’.

Javid remembers the 1980s riots in Bristol’s nearby St Paul’s district when he was ten.

But decades later, as a newboy MP, he gave short shrift to an official from the homeless charity, Shelter, who complained about housing benefit cuts.

‘I said: “By your definition you’ve just told me I was homeless as a child. That wasn’t my experience.” It was a small home but we had a great family life with lots of love and affection.’

His comprehensive, Downend School on the outskirts of Bristol, was tough.  ‘I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework.’

Javid got into a fight with a racist pupil who called him ‘Paki’. The boy was expelled, but it had a happy ending ten years later.

‘I bumped into him in a shopping centre lift. He said: “Sajid isn’t it? I’m sorry for what I did,” and we shook hands.’

Javid’s naughtiness ended abruptly when his dad read the riot act. ‘He said: “This is what I went through, don’t let me down.” I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed.’

Meanwhile, mum took her sons to the library and forced them to read.

Javid left with Maths O-level, but had to fight for that, too.

‘Hardly anyone did Maths  O-level. The school said they would only pay for me to sit CSE [lower than O-level]. But I argued – and my dad paid £32 for me to do it – a lot in those days.’

He went on to get a degree in economics and politics.

Unlike guilt-ridden Old Etonian David Cameron, who sends his children to state schools, ex comp boy Javid has no such hang ups.

His four children, girls of five, ten and 14 and a boy of 12, go to private schools. ‘We do what’s best for them,’ he says, matter of factly. 

In pride of place in his office is a portrait of his heroine, Margaret Thatcher. He has been a fan since the precocious age of 11.

‘I instinctively thought, “I really admire this woman”. My dad lived through the winter of discontent and used to vote Labour, but switched to Thatcher, saying, “look how she’s sorting out the country”. I agreed.’

He sounds like a multi-cultural William Hague. ‘I’ve got the hair style!’ says Javid, who lost his hair in his 20s and wet shaves it, adding to his City slicker image.

While other lads threw paper pellets at each other on the school bus, he grabbed a discarded copy of The Times, sat on his own and devoured news of Maggie’s latest triumph in the Falklands War or miners’ strike.

He suffered more discrimination at his first interview for a City job, with venerable British merchant bank, Rothschild.

‘They were so stuck up. They invited me into a hotel room, six men in pinstripe suits up on a stage with me standing below. It was obvious I wouldn’t get the job. I didn’t fit.’

But he was perfect for Chase Manhattan who were ‘more interested in the hunger in my belly’.

He was later head-hunted by Deutsche Bank, but refuses to comment on claims he made £20million in 15 years.

He has the confidence – and prudence – of a self-made man. He drives a £35,000 Range Rover Evoque, though the West Midlands MP quickly adds it is to support the local Land Rover car company, and buys his suits ‘cheaply in Hong Kong or Birmingham’ not Jermyn Street.

Javid and his wife live in a £4million home in Fulham, own a £2million house which is rented out in Chelsea, another in Bristol and a constituency residence.

‘I worked hard for 20 years, and was paid well and achieved things for me and my family,’ he says defiantly.

He slammed the door in the face of Vince Cable’s proposed mansion tax with gusto. ‘We already have a tax on people’s properties called council tax and I don’t see a case for another one.’

Javid is proud of his Muslim background, but regards himself as British. Asked if he will observe Ramadan he hesitates before replying: ‘I’m not practising.’

Does he read the Koran? ‘No, but how many people call themselves Christian and visit a church? God and Allah are the same thing.’

He refuses to say if he has his eyes on No10, but does not see his Anglo-Asian roots as a bar. ‘Britain is the world’s most tolerant country. If you have talent, colour and gender is less important.’

Could a state educated child from an under-represented minority who had old fashioned hard work and morals drummed into him by a shopkeeper father become PM by raw ability and doggedness?

Javid’s heroine Maggie did. He clearly dreams he could, too.
