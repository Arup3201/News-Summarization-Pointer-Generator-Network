An art student has been given the highest possible award for an A level project dedicated to her dying mother.

When former beauty queen Denise Powis, 51, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given just months to live, her daughter Becca chose to stay at home to spend as much time with her as possible.

The young artist, 17, studied old photographs of her mother, a former model, while sitting at her bedside.

Art student Becca Powis - who dedicated her A-level project to painting and sketching pictures of her dying mother - has been rewarded with top marks for the moving artwork

She was so inspired by pictures of her mother posing on a car bonnet, winking into the camera, and a stunning black and white portrait, she decided to make her her muse for her A level art project.

She created seven pieces from Mrs Powis’ modelling portfolio which included oil paintings, pencil sketches and watercolour pieces. 

She died last December, midway through Becca’s course and just three months after being diagnosed with metastatic cancer.

Becca, one of four  children left by Mrs Powis, continued working on her A-level project in memory of her mother and submitted it in May.

And despite having just a 52 per cent attendance record in her final year at sixth form, Becca achieved an A* grade in art. She was also awarded the same grades for photography and fashion.

Becca, who lives with her dad Barry, a company director, and siblings Gemma, 16, and Ashley and Luke, 13, in Ferndown, Dorset, now intends to study a foundation art course and apply to university.

She said: 'I had started doing my project about the Rokeby Venus painting, but when mum was diagnosed I had a rethink.

The 17-year-old poured over old photographs of her mum, a former model, at her bedside and became so inspired by them she decided to 
centre her art course around them

'Mum used to be a model when she was younger and so I made my mum my project.

'We dug out all these old photos and newspaper cuttings about her, it was so moving to see her at her most beautiful.

'I was going to school like normal but I found it really hard to concentrate so I spoke to my teachers and they said if I felt more comfortable working at home that was fine.

'My mum was on an electric bed in the lounge so I set up a section in the same room and did all my work from there.

'I think she really enjoyed getting all the albums out and looking through everything again.'

All of her artwork was created from oil paints, sketches, and watercolours and was based on pictures of her mum in 1980 when she was 18.

Becca said: 'Mum did lots of beauty pageants and was a former Miss Wimborne.

'I created oil paintings, sketches, and watercolour pieces from some of the photographs and submitted seven in total.

'In a way, I guess it helped me. Sometimes it was really hard to get motivated and I just didn’t want to think about it, other times it was a good distraction.

'She was really proud of all the work that I did, I knew I had to carry it on.

'When I found out my results I was really pleased and my dad cried, he was over the moon.'

Mr Powus, a bathroom designer, said: 'I am so very proud that she has got so much strength in her, to concentrate on her studies at such a hugely emotional and difficult time, and I know her mum would be too.'
