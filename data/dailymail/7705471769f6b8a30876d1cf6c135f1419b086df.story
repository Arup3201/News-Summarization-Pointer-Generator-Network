V. Stiviano’s part in the firestorm over Donald Sterling has taken a fresh turn – after she reportedly crashed the Ferrari he gave her.

Miss Stiviano sparked controversy after an audio recording was leaked of the 81-year-old LA Clippers owner launching a racist rant in which he berated his girlfriend for being seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson.

Now it has emerged that the 31-year-old has been involved in a road crash, having rolled the Ferrari Mr Sterling is said to have given her as a gift into the back of another car.

TMZ reports that she was driving the luxury red car behind a Range Rover when she is believed to have failed to stop and rear ended the vehicle in Beverley Hills.

The Range Rover driver has told the website that she was wearing her distinctive visor at the time of the crash.

The report says Miss Stiviano then jumped out of her Ferrari before ‘screaming every obscenity in the book’ telling the driver: ‘You know who you’re messing with, mother f*****?’

When it came to exchanging insurance details by the side of the road, she reportedly refused and asked ‘an assistant’ to do it instead.

Miss Stiviano is then said to have claimed she had to return the vehicle, though she did not expand on the comment.

The incident came just days after the former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said of V Stiviano: 'I don't wish that girl any bad luck, but I hope she gets hit with a car.'

He made the remark after being asked about the race row involving Mr Sterling, his friend of 30 years.

A lawsuit filed by Mr Sterling’s estranged wife of 50 years, Rochelle, claimed to show how the Clipper’s owner treated his girlfriend by lavishing her with a series of gifts including the Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover and a $1.4 million apartment.

Mr Sterling was banned from the NBA after tapes surfaced of him telling Miss Stiviano not to bring black people to his games or pose with them in photos on Instagram.

She had posed in the picture with basketball great Magic Johnson several weeks ago.

Miss Stiviano, who has described herself as being his 'confidante and friend', has denied releasing the tapes.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has since banned Mr Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million.

During a television interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Mr Sterling started by apologising for his racist comments.

But as the interview progressed he blamed the media for blowing his words out of proportion before going on an angry attack against Magic Johnson, one of the targets of his racist remarks.

Sterling first said the former basketball star was a ‘good person’ but his tone quickly changed and he made a series of disparaging remarks about Johnson's HIV-positive status, dismissing his work in charity and business and saying he's not a proper role model for children.

He then said he believed his estranged girlfriend duped him by recording their private conversations.‘She would always use the word “black,”’ Mr. Sterling said of Stiviano.

‘That's a black girl, that's a black guy, this is black, that's black. So when she said to me I'm going to bring “four gorgeous black guys to the game,” players she was referring to either football or basketball, I was a little jealous maybe.’

The NBA swiftly punished Sterling following the release of the first recordings, banning him from the league for life and hitting him with a $2.5million fine.

They may also force him to sell the team, and the NBA's Advisory/Fianance committee met by conference call last Wednesday to discuss the possible termination.

The committee released a statement saying they will meet again next week to discuss the matter further.

Three-quarters of the NBA team owners would have to vote in agreement in order to force Sterling to sell.

Former Time Warner Cable head and Obama advisor Dick Parsons has been chosen as the team's interim CEO for the transition period.

Meanwhile, Sterling's estranged wife Shelly hopes to hold on to her 50 per cent stake in the Los Angeles team.
