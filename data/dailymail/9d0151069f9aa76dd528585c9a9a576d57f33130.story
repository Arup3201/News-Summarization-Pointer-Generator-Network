Heartbreak: Carol Thatcher found out her mother had died while she was in Spain

Carol Thatcher found out her mother had died while she was visiting Spain to begin a Spanish language course, it was reported today.

The 59-year-old's mother Baroness Thatcher died on Monday after suffering a stroke while staying at London's Ritz Hotel.

Miss Thatcher, who lives Switzerland, has been learning the language for several years at Tilde languages school in Madrid. 

But she emailed the school on the day of her mother’s death to tell staff that she would not be able to attend, according to the Telegraph.

Lola Gonzalez Martinez, the school’s co-director, said: 'Carol contacted the school to tell us that she would be unable to attend the course here and we understood, having already heard the news of the death of Margaret Thatcher.

'She was due to attend classes here starting next Monday but clearly she can’t meet that commitment.

'I’m sure the death didn’t come as any great surprise as I understand that her mother’s health was deteriorating for quite some time but it must still be very upsetting for Carol.'

It is understood that she is now travelling back from Spain to Switzerland and she will arrive in Britain before the end of the week.

Her twin brother Sir Mark Thatcher flew back from his holiday in Barbados on Tuesday night.

Miss Thatcher lives in Klosters, the upmarket ski resort in the Swiss Alps favoured by the Royals, in a flat with her on/off partner of 20 years, ski instructor Marco Grass.

She left on Sunday morning – the day before her mother’s stroke – on the pre-planned trip, according to Mr Grass.

A neighbour at their apartment, which has a traditional Swiss wooden balcony with stunning views said: ‘Everybody knew about Carol’s famous mother. The news is very sad.’

Miss Thatcher has not been seen in public or made a statement since news of her mother's death was revealed.

Yesterday her twin brother Sir Mark Thatcher today said Baroness Thatcher would have been 'honoured and humbled' by the presence of the Queen at her funeral.

Speaking outside his mother’s home in Belgravia, central London, Sir Mark said his mother's death was 'without doubt a very sad moment'.

In his first appearance since the her death he said Lady Thatcher 'was blessed with a long life, and a very full one.'

Baroness Margaret Thatcher at the age of 33, has time to play with her twin children Mark and Carol aged six, Both engrossed in their toy garage and motor cars in 1959

'However the inevitability or the 
inevitable conclusion may appear of the recent illness that she 
suffered, it is no easier for us to bear in what is without doubt a very
sad moment.

The 59-year-old said the family had 
been 'simply been overwhelmed by messages of support.'

'I know that my mother would be pleased they have come from people of all walks of life.'

He added the messages would be 'a 
source of encouragement and strength as we face the inevitable days 
ahead and for that I am most grateful.'

According to Lady Thatcher's confidant and adviser for 30 years, Robin Harris, her daughter was always much closer to her father Denis, who died in 2003 at the age of 88.

In 2008 Miss Thacher, who has always felt she 'came second' in her mother's affections to brother Mark, published a memoir - A Walk-on Part In The Goldfish Bowl - in which she revealed previously unknown details about her mother's dementia.

In particular, she disclosed that her
mother kept forgetting that husband Denis had died, adding: 'I had to 
keep telling her the bad news over and over again'.

Coming from her own daughter, this 
was widely seen as distasteful and deeply insensitive by Lady Thatcher's
friends - though it is, unclear whether Lady Thatcher, in her sad 
mental state, could ever have been fully aware of the contents of 
Carol's book.

The evidence of close friends would 
be enough to indicate that even if she did learn of its contents, she 
would have forgotten it almost immediately, never mind be 'bitter' about
it

Miss Thatcher abandoned Britain after
losing her job as a correspondent on BBC's One Show for describing a 
tennis player as a 'golliwog' in 2009.

She told the Telegraph she was 
'increasingly despondent about the state of this country' around the 
time she moved to Switzerland.
