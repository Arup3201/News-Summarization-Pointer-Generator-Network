'Violated lady's privacy and dignity': Syrian immigrant Ali Rashid (pictured) has been banned from every swimming pool and spa facility in the UK after sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel steam room

A sex pest was banned from every swimming pool and spa facility in Britain today after 'violating' a woman in a steam room.

Syrian national Ali Rashid, 44, kissed his victim 'from her ear down to her collar bone area' as she tried to relax at a four-star hotel.

When she backed off, he squashed her into the corner of the room, put his hand on her thigh and stroked her face.

The terrified woman reported the incident to hotel staff, saying she felt 'trapped and disturbed'.

When quizzed by police, Rashid attempted to turn the attack around and claimed: 'I no kiss her, she kiss me'.

But he later admitted one count of sexual assault when he appeared in court.

Rashid was spared jail, but a judge said he can not visit any spa, gym or swimming pool area where women are present for five years.

A court heard he and the woman were staying at the four-star Mercure Holland House hotel in Cardiff in January last year when he followed her into the steam room.

Prosecutor Jonathan Reece told Cardiff Crown Court: 'Rashid attempted to make conversation with her, asking her name before going to shake her hand.

‘As she put her hand out he grabbed hold of it and pulled her forward with enough force to pull her up onto her feet.

‘He put his arms around her, as if hugging her, he then began kissing the right side of her neck from her ear down to her shoulder/collar bone area.

‘This happened very quickly and clearly his victim was not expecting it and it took her by surprise.’

As the women backed off she fell back on to the bench. Rashid then squeezed in next to her squashing her into the corner of the steam room, Mr Reece said.

Mr Reece added: ‘He then put his hand on the top part of her thigh, onto her bare skin.

‘She pulled her legs up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them. He was telling her she looked beautiful, young looking and slim and stroking her face and hair.

‘This happened for some minutes and the woman was really disturbed by it, she felt she was trapped.’

Finally realising his attention was unwelcome, Rashid then pulled away from the woman telling her: ‘Don’t be angry, I touch and kiss you because I feel comfortable with you.’

Pest: The 44-year-old was given an eight-month jail term suspended for a year, told to sign the sex offenders' register and ordered to pay the victim £400 compensation

Following the assault the woman reported the incident to hotel staff who in turn informed police.
When officers interviewed Rashid he denied any wrongdoing.

He said: ‘I no kiss her, she kiss me.’

He told officers his victim had 
initiated the kiss after he greeted her, although he did admit to 
finding the woman attractive and asking her whether she had a boyfriend.

Defending Rashid, Stephen Thomas appealed to the judge for a lenient sentence.

Mr Thomas said: ‘All sexual assaults are serious however this sexual assault falls at the bottom of the rung.

‘It’s definitely in the lower 
category, there’s no touching of genitalia, no force used and no threats
used. There was minimal contact with his hands while it was over 
relatively quickly.

‘The offence was committed over a year ago and there haven’t been any problems since.

‘This is clearly a man with 
difficulties, he’s got very serious physical problems, serious back 
problems, serious leg problems and it’s very difficult for him.’

Sleazy: A prosecutor told Cardiff Crown Court (above) that Rashid 'began kissing the right side of her neck from her ear down to her shoulder/collar bone area'

But Judge Parry said: ‘This was a 
serious offence of its kind. It involved a breach of trust, the public 
trust people to behave themselves in public amenities such as swimming 
pools, jacuzzis and saunas.
‘People must feel that they’re safe to mingle with strangers because that is what they do at these places.

‘You violated this lady’s privacy and her dignity, you were persistent and she felt trapped.

‘It’s to her credit that she dealt 
with this matter with some fortitude and her evidence leads me to 
conclude that she reported this matter not for herself but to try and 
protect other people.’

Sentencing Rashid to eight months 
jail, suspended for a year, Judge Parry also imposed a curfew which 
requires him to be at home between the hours of 7pm and 6am every night 
until August 9.
He will also be required to register as a sex offender for 10 years.

Judge Parry added: ‘The will be one provision of that order.

‘You are not to enter any public or 
private swimming baths, sauna or jacuzzi facility to which women have 
access which means you will be able to attend swimming facilities on 
male only evenings.

‘That will be for five years.’

Rashid was also told to pay £400 compensation to his victim.
