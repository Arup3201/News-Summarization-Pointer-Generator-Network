A catfight broke out in a Spanish maximum-security prison when a model accused of shooting dead her millionaire British businessman ex-boyfriend confronted a rival prison beauty over a stolen mini-skirt.

Pretty Mayka Kukucova, 25, was punched in the face after confronting a suspected Mexican drug dealer she accused of stealing her favourite skirt.

Prison guards stepped in to save the Slovakian after she was punched in the face in the gym at the Costa del Sol jail where she is being held for allegedly shooting wealthy jeweller Andrew Bush dead in front of his new lover last April.

Governors at maximum-security Alhaurin de la Torre prison have now ordered staff to keep a close watch on the pair - revered as the jail's two best-looking women - for fear of another outbreak of violence.

Gypsy women in the prison close to Malaga have sided with Kukucova while south American inmates are supporting the Mexican, known only as Guadalupe.

An insider said: 'The two women have never seen eye to eye but now they hate each others' guts.

'The problems started because Kukucova accused Guadalupe of being behind the disappearance of her favourite skirt. 

'They had an argument which ended up with some hair-pulling and Mayka getting punched in the face. 

'The other woman took a kick to the back before she was pulled off from one of the gypsy women who jumped in to defend Kukucova.

'Prison chiefs are worried things could get out of hand because the inmates have divided into two rival groups with one supporting the Slovakian and the other the Mexican.

'Staff have been told to keep a close watch on both women to make sure there's no repeat.

'No-one was badly injured this time round but it might not be the same story if there is a next time.'

Kukucova told prison bosses she was set upon first when she was quizzed about the incident but both women ended up being thrown into isolation as punishment.

They promised to resolve their differences after a dressing-down before authorities agreed to keep it out of the prison register.

Another source said: 'Kukucova is the only one who comes anywhere near to Guadalupe in the beauty stakes.

'They're both breathtakingly attractive.

'Kukucova's probably assumed there was only going to be one other woman in their prison that could possibly wear the miniskirt that went missing from her cell.'

Police put out an international arrest warrant for the Slovakian beauty after she was seen driving off in Mr Bush's Hummer after allegedly shooting him dead on April 5 last year with an Italian-made .38 revolver inside his rented £2,500-a-month villa near Estepona.

The divorced dad-of-one, 48, had jetted to the Costa del Sol with Russian girlfriend Maria Korotaeva, 22, for a romantic weekend away to celebrate their five-month anniversary.

Maria told murder squad detectives Kukucova was lying in wait for them when they arrived and she heard a row and shots after leaving them inside the house to argue before his ex fled with the keys to her lover's 4x4.

His car was later found abandoned about 20 miles from the scene of the shooting.

Kukucova was extradited to Spain last May after handing herself more than 2,000 miles away in Slovakia.

She was remanded in custody by a judge who is still investigating the killing before deciding whether to recommend formal charges against the part-time model.

Kukucova is being formally investigated on suspicion of Mr Bush's homicide, which in Spain carries a maximum 15-year jail sentence, rather than the more serious charge of pre-mediated murder.

Miss Korotaeva revealed after the killing Mr Bush had the change the locks on his home in the UK because Kukucova was obsessed with her ex.

She told a newspaper: 'His daughter told me she was crazy jealous because we in love and she kept looking at pictures of me.

'Andy couldn't bear to hear her name. She was not nice to anyone.'

Mr Bush's daughter Ellie, 20, has claimed her dad had to ask Kukucova to find a new job after hiring her as an assistant in one of his Gold Trader shops in Bristol when she started behaving erratically because she was worried he was seeing other women.

The dead man's family had to bury him in Spain last June after the judge refused his family permission to repatriate his body to Britain.
