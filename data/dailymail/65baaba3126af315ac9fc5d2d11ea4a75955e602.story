William Hague apologised yesterday after calling a Labour MP a ‘stupid woman’ during Prime Minister’s Questions.

The Foreign Secretary muttered the insult twice and shook his head at Cathy Jamieson as she questioned David Cameron over Mr Hague’s lobbying on behalf of a Tory party donor.

Miss Jamieson’s question centred on previous suggestions that Mr Hague called Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni to ask him to let British firm Tullow Oil off a £200million capital gains tax bill, which the firm claimed had been unfairly charged.

Its chief executive Aidan Heavey gave £10,000 to the Tory party before the general election in 2010.

Miss Jamieson, 56, the shadow economic
 secretary, asked Mr Cameron: ‘Perhaps you could tell the House whether 
Mr Aidan Heavey’s donations to the Conservative Party had any influence 
on the Foreign Secretary’s intervention in his company’s tax dispute?’

Mr Hague later told MPs: ‘I mutter 
many things in this House.

'Others shout them rather louder than I do, 
but I mutter many things under my breath and I never intend any offence 
to any other honourable members.’

In March, the High Court heard that 
the Foreign Office leaked confidential documents to Tullow Oil while 
lobbying for the company.

The court heard that a letter to Mr 
Museveni from Henry Bellingham, Mr Hague’s minister for Africa, was 
shown to Tullow executives despite them not having the security 
clearance to view government documents.

Labour’s Ian Lucas also quizzed the PM
 about Mr Hague’s links with JCB while in opposition.

In 2001, Mr Hague 
took up a £45,000-a-year advisory role with the firm after quitting as 
Tory   leader.

JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford is a major Tory donor.

Mr Cameron replied: ‘JCB is a great 
British company that exports all over the world.

'Instead of trying to 
talk it down, we should be celebrating it.’

Fiona O’Donnell, the Labour 
MP who raised the point of order against Mr Hague, said: ‘William Hague 
has not denied calling Cathy Jamieson a “stupid woman” and his mealy 
mouthed excuses to the House were completely inadequate.’
