Yusuf Hameed says he has been knocked back from dozens of jobs over the last year because of his appearance

A job-hunter claims he has been left unemployable because he is covered in tattoos.

Yusuf Hameed, 40, has been knocked back from dozens of jobs over the last year because of his unconventional appearance.

His body art includes a Buddhism symbol on his forehead, two Thai boxing tattoos on the back of his head, and a yin yang on the back of his head.

He said he has applied for 450 jobs including a car wash attendant and a street cleaner but receives the same feedback - employers cannot hire him because of his tattoos.

Mr Hameed, from Batley, West Yorkshire, said: 'It is really getting me down and it is so hard to think that these tattoos are such a strong barrier against me getting a job.

'I came to Batley from Pontefract after being made redundant from a meat manufacturing company.

'I’ve been doing everything the job centre has told me and attended all my interviews but they take one look at my tattoos and won’t give me a chance.'

Muslim convert Mr Hameed got his first tattoo aged 14 but wishes he had never had them done.

He said: 'I used to hang around with a lot of lads older than me and they started getting them.

'I suppose it was peer pressure but as a mature person I would not have got them, especially seeing the reaction from strangers.

'When I go to interviews I can just see the person opposite me lose eye contact and focus on my tattoos,' he said.

'I’m more than qualified for a lot of the jobs I have been for but they all tell me my tattoos do not fit the company image.'

Mr Hameed is hopeful an employer can look past his ink and give him an opportunity.

Mr Hameed got his first tattoo at the age of 14 but now wishes he had never had them done.  His body art includes a Buddhism symbol on his forehead, two Thai boxing tattoos on the back of his head, and a yin yang on the back of his head.

He said: 'People generalise me and think I am not bothered about working and that I am a freeloader.

'I want employers to judge me on my skills and they will find out I’ve got lots to offer.

'Even if it is a week’s trial, I just need that chance.'
