A fox in the hen house is usually a recipe for disaster.

But having crept into a coop while its eight residents were pecking about outside, this cunning customer just curled up on a nest of their eggs for a nap.

Maybe he was tired and it was the closest thing he could find to a feather bed, or perhaps he was slyly dreaming of a chicken omelette for tea.

Pupils found this rather cosy-looking fox keeping a nest of freshly laid eggs warm in their school chicken coop

Whatever the reason, once snugly ensconced he was not going to be henpecked into leaving.

He
 barely batted an eyelid when pupils found him lying there when they 
went to collect the eggs from their primary school’s chickens during 
lunch break.

The 
excited ‘egg monitors’ ran back inside and told Jane France, office 
manager at Flying Bull Primary School in Portsmouth, what they had seen –
 and she grabbed her camera.

Mrs France, 57, said: ‘The chickens 
were quite happily scratching around in the garden – oblivious to the 
fox.’ Staff later moved the creature on and all the eggs were still 
intact.

'I don't suppose I'll ever take another photo like that!

Mrs France said the pupils ran excitedly into her office to tell her about the bizarre sight.

She added: 'The children who saw the fox were amazed that they had got so close to a wild animal.

'As
 luck would have it, my camera was on my desk as I had earlier taken 
some staff photos so I took the camera with me to have a look.

'I went into the coop and there in the corner was this beautiful fox sitting very still and quite unperturbed.

'What struck me was that he was a 
beautiful example - we have previously had foxes running through our 
grounds and they are generally thin and in very poor condition.

'Our fox had a beautiful bushy tail and his coat looked in good condition.'

With the chickens roaming free most of the morning, Mrs France said they had no idea how long the fox had been there.

She added: 'A colleague went into the shed after me and had a word with the fox and he left shortly after! All the eggs were intact and the chickens seemed none the wiser.'

The RSPCA said: 
‘Although this is a heart-warming story, where small pets are concerned,
 it is important to remember the fox is a predator.’
