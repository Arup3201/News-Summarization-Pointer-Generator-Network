A drunk Kate Moss is said to have 'blagged' her way on to a flight from Turkey to London without a ticket on Monday night.

The supermodel arrived at Bodrum Airport, south-west Turkey, 'clearly inebriated' after vacationing at a nearby detox centre, and held up a long line of passengers at the check-in desk for an EasyJet flight to London Gatwick.

An eye-witness told MailOnline that the 40-year-old spent a significant amount of time talking to the duty manager, suggesting that Moss was trying to travel without a ticket.

Turning on the charm: The model was seen chatting to the duty manager for some time, apparently trying to get a ticket

EasyJet representative has since dismissed claims that Kate 'disrupted'
 the flight following her arrival at the airport, telling MailOnline: 
‘Everybody on that flight had paid for their seat but the delay to the 
flight was not related to any one passenger, it was due to a delay of 
the incoming flight.

‘The
 behaviour of the passenger didn’t disrupt anyone on board and there was
 no cause for concern in relation to any of the passengers in terms of 
safety and wellbeing.’

Kate, who had been spending time 
at The LifeCo, in Göltürkbükü, where she has stayed previously, arrived 
at the airport at 8.30pm on Monday.

Chatting away: Kate was soon whisked off by the helpful member of staff before boarding the plane

She got in the queue for budget 
airline EasyJet’s 9.30pm flight to London Gatwick – a surprising choice 
for a multi-millionaire supermodel – and several fellow travellers 
reported that she was ‘drunk’ and appeared to be either without a 
boarding pass or ticket.

One eyewitness told MailOnline: ‘The 
general consensus was that she didn’t have a ticket but after chatting 
to the manager for some time she was whisked off and ushered on to a 
flight.

‘It was pretty obvious that Kate had had a bit to drink as she was talking loudly and didn’t seem worried about being seen.’

Amusing: Fellow travellers took to Titter to comment on their amusement and shock at sharing a flight with 'drunk' Kate

They added: ‘If I had showed up that drunk there’s no way I’d be let on the plane but she is Kate Moss.’

The flight was delayed and did not 
take off until 11.51pm, two hours and 21 minutes behind schedule, and 
subsequently arrived late at London Gatwick.

However, while on-board, the 
supermodel mother-of-one reportedly happily chatted away to those around
 her.

A number of star-struck travellers took to Twitter to say they had spotted the famous model.

One user, Rayanne, wrote: ‘Just got off my flight with a very drunk Kate Moss.’

While another, Amelia shared: ‘Seen Kate moss drunk in the airport.’

Fellow holiday-goer Jess tweeted: 'Kate Moss was on the same plane as me yesterday and and she was out of it. (sic)’

A single ticket from Bodrum to London Gatwick on the same EasyJet flight next week costs £129.

 her dressed in her typical rock chick all-black attire carting her own 
cabin sized black suitcase and a blue handbag.

Wellness: It's thought Kate was staying at the LifeCo Bodrum Detox Centre

Picture of health: On Tuesday Kate was seen back in London looking sprightly with daughter Lila Grace

Kate, who appears to be accompanied by
 a small group of female friends, can be seen smiling away as she is 
then ushered through the airport.

The visit to The LifeCo is not Kate’s first – she made a trip there ahead of her 40th birthday in January of this year.

The centre reportedly offers guests a chance to cut out solid foods – drinking fruit and vegetable juices.

According to their website guests will ‘regain long lost vigorous youth, lose weight and toxins’ during their detox.

A seven-day detox, which Kate is believed to favour, costs 3640 Euros for those wanting to stay in a suite.

A spokesperson for Kate declined to comment. 

EasyJet also declined to comment on 
the incident, adding that the company 'has a strict respect of privacy 
and it is the airline policy not to comment on any of its passengers.'
