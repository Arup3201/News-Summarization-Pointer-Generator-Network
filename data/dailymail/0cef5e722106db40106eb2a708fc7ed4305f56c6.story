The handcuffs and a medal awarded to the police officer who used them to arrest one of the UK’s most notorious serial killers - dubbed The Black Panther - is expected to fetch more than £15,000 at auction this month.

Donald Neilson - who died last December aged 75 - murdered 17-year-old heiress Lesley Whittle in 1975 and shot dead three sub-postmasters in armed robberies.

He was finally caught by heroic Constable Anthony John White on December 11, 1975 and was given five life sentences the following year.

Bonhams Auctioneers are selling Constable White’s Queens Gallantry medal, handcuffs and a huge archive of material relating to the case in Kensington, London on September 26.

Courageous PC White nearly lost his life apprehending Neilson after police officers spotted him in dark clothing hurrying past their panda car late at night.

They drove the car on to the road and came alongside the man so PC White could speak to him through the car window.

As the two officers were making notes of the answers to their questions, Neilson suddenly pointed a sawn-off shotgun at PC White, forcing him into the back of the car.

Neilson got into the front passenger seat, pushed the muzzle of the gun under the second officer’s left arm and ordered him to drive.

They drove for about four miles, and as they were approaching a road junction, PC White grabbed him round the neck and at the same time attempted to wrestle the shotgun from him.

During the violent struggle the shotgun discharged, narrowly missing the officers, who brought the car to a shuddering halt and enlisted the help of passersby to help.

Eventually the two officers managed to overpower Neilson and handcuff him.

At the court hearing a psychiatrist told the defence team: 'I’ve examined him and he’s the classic psychopath of all time.'

In 2008 Neilson applied to have his term reduced to 30 years but the High Court ruled he should never be released. He died in prison last year.
