The California man who created an anti-Muslim film that roiled the Middle East was sentenced Wednesday to a year in prison for violating his probation from a previous arrest.

Wednesday's sentence stems from a 2010 bank fraud conviction by lying about his identity, and has nothing specifically to do with the outrage that the film 'Innocence of Muslims' caused internationally.

None of the violations had to do with the content of his film, which depicts the Prophet Mohammad as a religious fraud, pedophile and a womanizer. The movie sparked violence in Libya and other parts of the Middle East, killing dozens.

Arrested: Filmmaker Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, pictured on the set of Innocence of Muslims, is accused of violating the terms of his probation

Jailed: Nakoula was ordered to be detained without bail due to the risk he could abscond

Defence: His lawyer said he risked violent reprisals from Muslim inmates if sent to prison

U.S. District Court Judge Christina 
Snyder immediately sentenced Mark Basseley Youssef after he admitted to 
four of the eight alleged violations, including obtaining a fraudulent 
California driver's license.

Youssef, 55, was arrested in late 
September, just weeks after he went into hiding when deadly violence 
erupted in Libya and other parts of the Middle East in response to the 
movie.

Enraged Muslims had demanded severe 
punishment for him, with a Pakistani cabinet minister even offering 
$100,000 to anyone who kills him.

The 14-minute trailer was 
posted to YouTube in July, but the violence did not break out until 
September 11 and has spread since, resulting in the death of Chris 
Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, alongside three other Americans.

Subterfuge: Nakoula was accompanied by U.S. marshals and a police convoy after his hearing on Thursday

Custody: Nakoula was taken for questioning on September 15, after his film provoked riots in the Muslim world

In hiding: The filmmaker was driven away by police from his home in Cerritos, California

The trailer still can be found on 
YouTube. The Obama administration asked Google, YouTube's parent, to 
take down the video but the company has refused, saying it did not 
violate its content standards.

Federal authorities were seeking a two-year sentence for Youssef, who remains held without bail.

Youssef served most of his 21-month 
prison sentence for using more than a dozen aliases and opening about 60
bank accounts to conduct a check fraud scheme, prosecutors said.

After he was released from prison, 
Youssef was barred from using computers or the Internet for five years 
without approval from his probation officer.

He also wasn't supposed to use any name other than his true legal name without the prior written approval of his probation officer.

At least three names have been associated with Youssef since the film trailer surfaced - Sam Bacile, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula and Youssef. Bacile was the name attached to the YouTube account that posted the incindiary video, and the name by which he introduced himself to the actors and producers of the film who signed on to the project not knowing that he intended to rework it to be anti-Muslim.

Flames: The reaction to the video led to the sacking of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, pictured

Suing: Cindy Lee Garcia says she was misled over the role she would be playing in the controversial video

Court documents show Youssef legally 
changed his name from Nakoula in 2002, though when he was tried, he 
identified himself as Nakoula.

He wanted the name change because he believed Nakoula sounded like a girl's name, according to court documents.

Among the violations Youssef denied 
were obtaining a fraudulent California driver's license, telling federal
authorities that his role in the film was limited to writing the script
and using the "Nakoula" name throughout his bank fraud case.

Prosecutors recently sought 
transcripts from a pair of 2009 hearings in the bank fraud case where 
Youssef told two judges that his true name was Nakoula Basseley Nakoula.
