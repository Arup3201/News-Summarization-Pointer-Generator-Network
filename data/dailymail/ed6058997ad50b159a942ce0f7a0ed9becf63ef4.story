West Ham striker Diafra Sakho was blasted by Senegal coach Alain Giresse on Monday night for playing in the FA Cup on Sunday despite pulling out of the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury.

The 25-year-old came off the bench to score a late winner against Bristol City, but Senegal officials were not expecting him to play.

Giresse said: ‘I’m very surprised to learn that he played. When you cannot fly for six weeks and then suddenly you’re playing a football game. There must be miraculous medicine in England.

‘This sets a dangerous precedent because in future you are going to have players claiming they cannot catch planes to Africa but who can still play football (for their clubs). It is a debate that deserves more discussion.’

Senegal did not demand a ban on him playing for his club during the Nations Cup after threatening to do so.

‘He’s still unable to fly,’ West Ham boss Sam Allardyce explained. ‘We had to drive him down in a limo but it was about putting him on the bench with the hope we didn’t have to use him.

‘We don’t think we’ve done anything wrong.’
