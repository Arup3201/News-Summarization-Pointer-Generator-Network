An enormous black hole has opened up in the pension funds of Britain’s leading companies since the financial crisis, grim figures showed yesterday.

Final salary company pension schemes in the FTSE 100 index of blue chip firms swung from a surplus of £14billion at the end of 2008 to a deficit of £57billion at the end of 2013, according to the report.

The analysis, by pension experts Jardine Lloyd Thompson, showed that the shortfall for all private sector final salary schemes now stands at £150billion.

An enormous black hole has opened up in the pension funds of Britain's leading companies since the financial crisis, grim figures showed yesterday

The dramatic deterioration in the health of company pension schemes has come despite the stock market soaring 52 per cent since the end of 2008 including a rise of more than 14 per cent in 2013.Shares typically make up around 35 per cent of pension fund portfolios with the rest split between government bonds, property and other assets.

Experts warned that firms will now be forced to pump more money into the pension schemes to make-up the shortfall - depriving them of cash for investment crucial to the economic recovery.

Pensions expert Ros Altmann, a former government adviser, said: ‘It is difficult for corporate UK.

‘Companies with pension deficits will be unable to invest so much in their business because they have to put more money into their pension schemes.

‘It gives the UK a big handicap relative to other countries because the deficits here are higher than they are in Europe for example.

‘It does also demonstrate just how expensive it is to deliver a decent pension. Part of the issue is that people are living longer.’ 

Pension funds have big portfolios of shares, government bonds and property and other assets.Shortfalls appear when these investments are not sufficient to cover their future commitments to retired employees.

Record low interest rates of 0.5 per cent and the Bank of England¿s £375billion money-printing programme have left large holes in company pension funds by driving down returns on government bonds

Firms are trying to plug the gaps by paying in extra or insisting on bigger contributions from staff.

But record low interest rates of 0.5 per cent and the Bank of England’s £375billion money-printing programme have left large holes in company pension funds by driving down returns on government bonds.

Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, has said that firms with final salary schemes ‘are being clouted’ by quantitative easing in particular.

The prospect of higher inflation - which determines how much firms pay out to former employees throughout their retirement - has also put a strain on pension funds at a time when people are living longer.

Many firms have now closed their final salary, or defined benefit, pension schemes because they are too expensive even after increased contributions from staff.

Charles Cowling, director of JLT Employee Benefits, said: ‘2013 has proved to be a tough year for UK defined benefit pension schemes. Deficit levels remain stubbornly high despite strong equity markets and significant cash contributions from employers.

‘In the last five years, since the financial crisis, the equity market has performed strongly with the FTSE 100 up 52 per cent , but for pension schemes there has been no such cheer with the total deficit in the pension schemes of FTSE 100 companies up by £71billion over the same period.

‘What will 2014 bring? Potentially more of the same.’
