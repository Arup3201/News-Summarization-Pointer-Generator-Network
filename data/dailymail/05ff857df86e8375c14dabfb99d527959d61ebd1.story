Victim: Rico Dardis, 30, from Poole, Dorset, was killed when his friends pushed him overboard and ran him over with a speedboat, a court heard today

An aspiring rapper was killed when his friends pushed him overboard and ran him over with a speedboat, a court heard today.

Rico Dardis, 30, got into an argument with Paul Gerlach, 52, and Louis Borzoni, 50, over cigarettes as they cruised on a powerboat off the coast of Christchurch Bay in Dorset.

The pair allegedly pushed him overboard, before running him over with the boat's propeller - ripping both of his legs off.

The father-of-one's dismembered body was discovered by police floating in the surf, while one of his legs was found entangled in the propeller of Gerlach's Mazxum speedboat, 'No Chance'.

Today Gerlach and Borzoni denied murdering Mr Dardis, from Poole, Dorset, at Winchester Crown Court.

The court heard that the trio had been enjoying a drink-fuelled daytrip on the afternoon of May 27 last year when they had started arguing over cigarettes and alcohol. 

Witness Anthony Soper said the defendants had been 'having a go' at Dardis, described as a 'talented freestyle rapper' by his family.

He said one had shouted: 'You are being 
ungrateful, you’ve smoked all my cigarettes and drunk all my beer.'

Other witnesses said they had seen trio drinking, shouting and swearing as they had clumsily walked to a dinghy to where the speedboat was moored at around 3pm.

Six hours later, families relaxing at Christchurch Bay called the police after spotting Gerlach and Borzoni acting suspiciously onboard the broken boat as they returned to shore.

Far from calling for help, the pair were trying to unclog the propeller, before going off to buy more drinks while laughing and joking, jurors were told.

Opening the trial, Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, said Borzoni had told one woman who had spotted Dardis's torso in the water at around 9pm: ‘Oh, maybe it’s a dummy’.

'Gerlach and Borzoni quarrelled with Dardis and pushed him off the boat,' he said. 'He was then deliberately run over by the boat and killed.

'His body was dismembered by the propeller which ceased to function because parts of his body were entangled in it.

'Neither did anything to call for help or anything of that nature. They made some efforts to recover the body parts and then allowed the boat to drift into the shore, which was seen by some people.'

Mr Bowes said Gerlach and Borzoni were arrested by police later that evening, but both denied deliberately causing Mr Dardis's death.

'Really, they were saying well, it must have been an accident, that he fell off the boat and somehow, and even though it was moving forward, he managed to get entangled at the back,' he said.

'The prosecution’s case is that both defendants agreed that Mr Dardis should be run over by the boat and deliberately killed, and that each is guilty of murder.'

Brenda Pidgley, who was at Christchurch Bay with her family, spotted the speedboat in a broken state next to a groyne at the beach at around 9pm, said Mr Bowes.

Borzoni - who was covered in blood - was reportedly ‘fiddling’ with the propellor at the back of the boat for about 20 minutes.

Mrs Pidgley then noticed 'what appeared to be a shop mannequin' floating face down around three to four metres behind the boat, but neither man took any notice of it,' the jury heard.

Walkers Gillian and Alan Bennett helped the defendants pull the boat up the beach and tie it up, but rang 999 after they saw the body.

'Once the boat had been tied up, Mrs Bennett saw what she believed to be a body in the water and said "Oh my goodness, I think it’s a body",' said Mr Bowes.

'The response from the man on the boat, Borzoni, was "Oh, maybe it’s a dummy".

'Plainly he knew perfectly well it was not but far from calling for any help or acknowledging it was a body, his response was - "I think it’s a dummy".'

Mr Bennett then called the police - prompting Borzoni to swear and say: 'What, the filth?', the court heard.

However, the defendant later apologised and explained that he had had 'a hell of a day'.

Borzoni and Gerlach then abandoned the vessel and flagged down a taxi to take them back to the Renault van they had arrived in earlier, the court heard.

Gerlach reportedly told the driver: ‘Yeah, we murder’, when asked about their day.

They then drove to buy drinks at a Co-Op store, where Gerlach allegedly joked about his blood-stained state to a shop assistant, saying: 'Oh you should see the other guy, he’s dead'.

The pair were arrested after driving back to the car park - where they had left a bag containing a bloody towel and a meat cleaver - at around 10pm.

Gerlach, who had been driving, was more than 2.5 times over the drink drive limit, the court heard.

Mr Bowes said: 'Version one of Gerlach’s story, which is absolutely untrue, was that he had driven forwards, Rico had fallen off the back and somehow become entangled in the propeller.

'Marine experts say that really would not happen, but a moment’s common sense would also demonstrate that. It is a complete lie.'

Both of the defendants confessed to killing Mr Dardis in bugged conversations while on police bail and showed ‘callousness and indifference’, Mr Bowes said.

He added: 'Both were totally indifferent to the suffering they would have caused. All Borzoni could say was it was "unfortunate".'

The court heard that Gerlach was recorded boasting to his estranged wife, Anita Gerlach, that he and Borzoni had pushed their victim into the water because he had been beating them up.

In the recordings, he said: 'He was floating, floating like a hundred yards away. I turned around, went around him and said: ‘You’re not bullying any c*** now are ya? You’re not bullying any c*** now are ya?’

'You gotta realise we’re f***ing covered in blood, beat to f***. We were going round, there I was driving round, I said "You’re not f***ing beating up c***s now are ya?

'I honestly, mate, I just whacked the throttle down, whacked the throttle down and I’m not remorseful.'

Meanwhile, Borzoni allegedly told his brother Marco Borzoni: 'I hated the bloke. Really f***ing hated him and he deserved what he got.

'He was asking for it. The anger came out and I let it take control. I keep getting nightmares since it happened, over and over again.'

He later said in a taped conversation: 'I’m as guilty as f***, so is me mate, but there’s no evidence we f***ing can suss out.

'What’s done is done. He was a complete and utter t***.'

The court heard that post-mortem tests on Mr Dardis's body had revealed that both of his legs had been amputated by the propellor.

The cause of death was given as drowning, associated with entanglement and injury by a boat propeller.

Speaking outside court, Mr Dardis's family paid tribute to a ‘fantastic dad’ and ‘devoted’ son, and said his death was ‘heartbreaking’.

The trial continues.
