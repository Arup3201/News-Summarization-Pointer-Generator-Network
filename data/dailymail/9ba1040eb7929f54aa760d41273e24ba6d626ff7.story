Hasan Aydemir, 28, (pictured outside court earlier this week) was unhappy when sister Hatice decided to tie the knot without the family's blessing, a court heard

A Turk who tried to stop his sister marrying her jobless fiance by sending a fake bomb as a wedding present was jailed for four years yesterday.

Hasan Aydemir, 28, was unhappy when his younger sister, student Hatice, decided to tie the knot with Menderes Atici without her family’s blessing.

Three days before the ceremony in Istanbul, he mocked up his bomb with a clock, electrical wiring and putty made to look like plastic explosives.

He carefully wrapped the device in a presentation box and even neatly tied it with a red ribbon before posting it from a branch of UPS in Camden, north London.

It was addressed to the wedding hall in the Gungoren area of Istanbul where his sister was due to be married three days later, and included instructions for it to be placed on the top table.

Attached to the package was a piece of white paper bearing the words which translated into English as: 'Leave the package on the table of the bride and groom on 20/03/2011. The package is my gift to Hatice-Metin.'

Aydemir, of Tottenham, north London, also phoned the reception hall to ensure that his instructions to take delivery of the parcel were carried out.

The package, which had been listed as containing a teddy bear and a wrist watch, was intercepted by a customs official at Ataturk airport in Istanbul

Bomb disposal experts were called before the item was declared to be a hoax.

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command investigated the incident and identified the sender of the parcel as Aydemir.

Although he had used false details on the forms, they were able to identify him through CCTV footage and phone records and officers arrested him at his home address on March 23 last year.

Detectives seized a mobile phone during the search of the house, which contained text messages demonstrating his opposition to the marriage.

Jurors heard that when Aydemir sent the parcel on March 17 last year, he was locked in a family dispute about his sister’s wedding and hoped to disrupt the service by sending the hoax bomb.

Jailing Aydemir at Blackfriars Crown Court, Judge Ian Karsten QC said: ‘It's hard to think of a nastier or more horrid thing to do.

‘It was because of your strong feelings about your sister’s wedding that you concocted these extremely vindictive and cruel plans.

‘It is a very serious case of bomb hoaxing as it took a very serious amount of planning.

‘I accept though that it came about from a misguided attempt to protect your sister.’

The court heard Aydemir’s family were outraged at the prospect of Hatice’s nuptials.

His brother-in-law Secki Kocack said: ‘My wife’s family were very displeased with Menderes as it is traditional to ask a girl’s family for permission to court her,’ he said.

‘He had not done this, he did not have a job and the family did not know him, so they were against Hatice travelling to Turkey to wed him.

‘She was at university at the time and they thought that she had not thought through her decisions.

‘It also brought shame on their family.’

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, senior national co-ordinator of counter terrorism, said: 'Hasan Aydemir had clearly gone to great lengths to make a realistic-looking hoax device, which was designed to deceive anyone seeing it into thinking that it was a bomb.

'His actions were extremely irresponsible and wasted valuable police resources both in Turkey and in London.

'We hope that the sentence will reinforce the message that the police investigate all incidents of hoaxes thoroughly and bring those responsible before the court.'

Aydemir denied dispatching an article with intent.
