The wife of the Sydney siege gunman who is facing charges for alleged murder could have her freedom revoked after the NSW Attorney General demanded a review into the decision to grant her bail.

Amirah Droudis, 35, was granted bail by a local court after she was charged with the murder of Man Haron Monis's estranged wife Noleen Hayson Pal in April 2013.

Attorney General Brad Hazzard said he has expressed concern to the Director of Public Prosecution over Droudis' bail after two people died when her husband took 18 people hostage in the Lindt cafe at Martin Place on Monday.

Police allege Droudis stabbed Ms Pal 18 times in her Werrington apartment in western Sydney and set her on fire.

Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to the murder when he entered the Martin Place cafe and took his hostages on Monday. 

A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty.

'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement on Thursday.

'This week I asked the DPP to review any cases where bail had been granted where there may have been any similarity to the circumstances of Man Haron Monis.

'In this case the allegation is that he and she had involvement in the murder of Monis' ex-wife.

'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' 

NSW Premier Mike Baird said he shared everyone’s rage that Monis was out on bail.

'The public need to know: We have already taken action and strengthened the bail laws. The new, tougher laws come into effect next month. I am advised that these laws would have succeeded where our old laws have failed us,' he said in a statement.

'The advice I have from NSW Police is that the hostage taker did not have a gun license. Questions remain around how he was in possession of a weapon. We will get to the bottom of it. 

'I am determined that we will learn from these events. I’ve announced, along with the Prime Minister, that we will be having a full review of the events leading up to the siege.

'I assure you: If we have to do anything more, we will.' 

Before Droudis married self-styled Sheikh Monis she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage.

Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, southwest Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years.

As a young adult, she would often visit bars, drink and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia.

But after she met the Iranian fanatic in the mid-2000s,  Droudis dropped her birth name in favour for Amirah, an Arabic name, and converted to Islam.

'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, 'I'm whatever now''.

The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years.

Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday.

Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. 

Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with.

'She's always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it's also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.'

Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions.

Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God's will. The videos bear the address of Monis' website. 

'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab.

In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.'

'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.'

The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. 

At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan.

Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service.

In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case.
