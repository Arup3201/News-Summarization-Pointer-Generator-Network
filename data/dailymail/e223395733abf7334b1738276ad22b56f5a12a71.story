Thanks to celebrities like Cara Delevingne and the Duchess of Cambridge, bold, defined eyebrows are coveted by many young women.

It was a look that student Sarah, 24, from Bath, wanted but she became sick of spending hours with an eyebrow pencil to get the shape just right every day.

'Every morning was daunting - drawing them on and feeling depressed if they didn't look right,' she told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers.

Sarah, 24, from Bath, became sick of spending hours with an eyebrow pencil every morning so she took drastic action and had them tattooed on 

The tattoos were darker than she expected and make her look 'constantly surprised'

So Sarah took drastic action by having dark eyebrows tattooed on to her face.

But she now admits it hasn't given her the results she desired.

She said: 'Having the tattoos was excruciating. I told the tattooist I wanted black eyebrows but I didn't think they would be this black. 

'I don't know what I was thinking as I'm naturally blonde.'

The student, who lives in Leicester, had to dye her hair brown and cut a chunky fringe in an attempt to make her bold brow less noticeable.

The student had a fringe cut to try and hide her tattoos and had to pencil them in when they started fading and turning blue in colour

Sarah said she now finds her appearance embarrassing as her eyebrows make her look 'constantly surprised.'

The move hasn't saved her time on her morning beauty regime as hoped either, as she still has to use her eyebrow pencil because the tattoos have started to turn blue as they've faded.

In addition, she has to spend longer doing her hair to ensure they're not on show.

She said: 'It was supposed to be a quick fix so I didn't have to do all this plucking, shaving and painting them on.

'But now before I leave the house I have to spend ages doing hair to make sure they can't be seen.'

Sarah added that the tattoos have also made her feel self-conscious, so she's not as sociable as she used to be.

She said: 'I don't tend to go out much now as I have it in my head that people are looking at me - that's most upsetting. 

'I want them gone'.

She is hoping to eventually achieve this by having painful laser removal surgery.

Bodyshockers is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm
