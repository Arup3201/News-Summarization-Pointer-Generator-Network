Tony Pulis has revealed West Ham co-owner David Sullivan called West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace to clear the air after Carlton Cole’s switch to the Hawthorns collapsed at the last minute on transfer deadline day.

Cole had agreed terms and was at the club’s training ground late into the night ready to put pen to paper before West Ham pulled the plug because their move for Emmanuel Adebayor collapsed.

It left Cole furious with manager Sam Allardyce, but Pulis said the situation had always been clear to West Brom. Even so, Sullivan spoke to Peace to explain the eleventh hour change.

‘David Sullivan called our chairman and spoke to him, and that shows you how both parties were,’ said Pulis. ‘I think he spoke to Jeremy and said to him that if the situation had been different we’d have done the deal, which was right through to the last minutes of negotiations.

‘But there was never any secret as to what the situation was. If they had brought someone in then Carlton would have been available. If they didn’t then he was going back, which was made clear so that was fine.’

Cole is set to face West Brom at the Hawthorns on Saturday. ‘That’s the way it spins at times,’ said Pulis. 'I’ve always thought he’s a good player who gives you different options, and on his day he’s a handful, whilst his goalscoring record - when he plays - is decent. He’s different to what we have.’
