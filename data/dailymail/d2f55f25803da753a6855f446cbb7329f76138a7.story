Having decided their transfer business was done, Stoke City might be forced into a rethink on bringing in an attacking wide player following Peter Odemwingie's knee injury against Manchester City on Saturday.

Less likely are high-profile departures from The Britannia. 

There is no will to sell Ryan Shawcross to Everton or let goalkeeper Jack Butland go on loan unless another Premier League club guarantees him first-team action.

Deals: Stoke are hoping to keep Ryan Shawcross (left) but may enter the market for an attacking player

Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi is the player Mark Hughes wants to sign as cover for Odemwingie, who suffered the potentially long-term knee injury on Saturday.

Assaidi, 26, impressed on loan at Stoke last season and the club agreed a fee with Liverpool only for the player to fail to agree personal terms. 

Brendan Rodgers is on a purge of fringe players, with Daniel Agger gone and Sebastian Coates travelling to Sunderland.
