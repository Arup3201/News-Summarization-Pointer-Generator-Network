Three people wounded in the shooting that killed 12 people at a Colorado theatre have filed lawsuits alleging the exit door the gunman used to enter the building should have had an alarm.

Two lawsuits were filed on Friday in U.S. District Court on behalf of newlyweds Denise Traynom, 24, and Brandon Axelrod, 30, and Joshua Nowlan, 31, an Iraq war veteran, all wounded in the July, 20 shooting.

The lawsuits filed against the subsidiary of Cinemark Holdings Inc. are believed to be the first. They were filed the same day the company revealed plans to refurbish and reconfigure the theatre and have it ready to open by the beginning of 2013.

Theatre victim: Joshua Nowlan, 31, an Iraq war veteran, is one of three victims of the July, 20 shooting that have filed a lawsuit against the Cinemark theatre

James Holmes, 24, is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 others during a special midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises.'

Prosecutors allege the former University of Colorado, Denver, graduate student left the theatre through a back exit, propped open the exit door and re-entered the theatre to begin the shooting.

The lawsuits claim Holmes was able to move his car into position after went through the back exit.

‘Throughout that time, no employee or security personnel contacted him, deterred him, monitored him or stopped him from that re-entry,’ one of the complaints reads.

Responsibility: Brandon Axelrod, 30, pictured, and his wife Denise Traynom, 24, have also filed suit claiming the theatre could have prevented the shooting that killed 12

In addition to failing to have alarmed exit doors, the lawsuits claim Cinemark was negligent in failing to hire extra security for the midnight showing or generally protect patrons who were sitting in a darkened theatre.

The company also knew of at least one prior shooting at the theatre, including assaults and robberies, the complaints say.

They also say Cinemark failed to help evacuate the theatre even after the shooting ended. The lights were either off or very low even after the gunfire stopped, according to the lawsuit.

'Any person who wished to make a surreptitious and unauthorized entry into the theatre could easily determine that the lack of security personnel and lack of any alarm on the door at the right, front by the screen of Auditorium would allow them to leave the theatre, and re-enter without fear of being discovered, interfered with, monitored or stopped,' it reads.

Ms Traynom was wounded in the buttocks, while Mr Axelrod suffered bone injuries to his right knee and ankle. Mr Nowlan's right arm was nearly severed by a bullet, and he was also wounded in his left leg.

'Josh helped me protect my wife, and he got shot. It wasn't expected. But I'm glad he was there with us because the three of us together, we piled on each other and we kept each other safe. And you know, luck or faith, whatever you want to call it, kept us alive,' Mr Axelrod told CNN just after the shootings.

Meanwhile, Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan was celebrating the announcement that Cinemark will reopen the theatre. Cinemark President and CEO Tim Warner advised Hogan of the company's intention by letter before the lawsuits were filed.

In a statement, Mr Hogan said there has been overwhelming support for the decision to reopen the theatre.

'We will always remember those who lost their lives and the many others impacted that day. While no one will ever forget that day, this is another step in the community's healing,' Mr Hogan said.

In a letter to Cinemark, the mayor asked that special provisions be made for a victim and survivor visitation, memorials, and a change to the outside appearance of the building.

Details of the changes that would be made were not immediately available.

The trio’s attorney, former Denver judge Christina Habas, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Cinemark USA Inc. had no immediate comment.
