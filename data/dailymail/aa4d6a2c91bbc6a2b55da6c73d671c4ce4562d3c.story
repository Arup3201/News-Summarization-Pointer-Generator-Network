Usman Yasin, 30, pictured, was found guilty of hitting 81-year-old Patricia Pearson in a road rage attack after first claiming he acted in self-defence

An elderly woman was badly injured when she was hit across the face by a fellow motorist – for driving too slowly.

Patricia Pearson, 81, had allegedly been driving at 5mph  when she became the victim of a road rage attack while on her way to visit her husband at a care home.

Her injuries included a swollen lip, lumps on her forehead and cuts to her cheek.

The other driver, Usman Yasin, 30, was warned he could face jail after being convicted of assaulting Mrs Pearson.

Magistrates heard how Yasin became increasingly frustrated as he travelled behind Mrs Pearson in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, at around 2pm on June 17.

He claimed that she was driving at no more than 5mph.

As the two cars reached a point where the road opened up Yasin darted past Mrs Pearson and pulled in front of her, coming to a stop.

She got out of her car and approached Yasin’s green Peugeot 206, leaning into the window to ask what he was doing. He unleashed a barrage of foul-mouthed abuse, Burton magistrates’ court heard.

Mrs Pearson put her hand towards Yasin’s face in an attempt to make him be quiet, and he swung out an arm and hit her across the face.

Yasin, from Burton, then got out of his car and approached the victim, only for bystander David Smith to come between the two and intervene. Frederick Powell, prosecuting, said: ‘Any remorse that he says he has shown is crocodile tears.

'Had it not been for Mr Smith getting in the way, he would have gone after her again.’

Yasin said he acted in self-defence and claimed Mrs Pearson struck the first blow. He admitted striking her with the back of his hand, but denied further accusations of assault.

He said her injuries were a lot worse because of her age. Mrs Pearson, also from Burton, said that when Yasin got out of his car, he pushed her and shook her.

But magistrates accepted that Mrs Pearson, who was said to have been ‘frightened’ by the attack, had become ‘confused’ in her recollection of the events.

Yasin told the court: ‘I am very remorseful. She’s the same age as my grandma. If I had taken a second to think and had just driven on I wouldn’t be here today.’

The case was adjourned until October 10 for a pre-sentence report.
