Eugenie Bouchard has a worldwide ‘Genie Army’ of fans which began in Australia last year. 

They were were out in force for her 7-6, 6-0 win over Caroline Garcia but it’s become a bit corporate now — they all wore matching T-shirts sponsored by a Canadian whisky firm.

Britain's Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot both made it through to the third round of the men’s doubles. Murray and his Australian partner John Peers defeated Australia’s Omoar Jasika and John Patrick Smith 6-2, 6-3. Inglot and Romania’s Florin Mergea overcame Argentina’s Horacio Zeballos and Diego Schwartzmann 7-6, 4-6, 6-2.

Nick Kyrgios is front-page news in Australia after defying a nose bleed to beat Tunisia’s Malek Jaziri in straight sets, and he could yet face Andy Murray in the quarter-finals. Bernard Tomic is also through — bizarrely, none of Aussie’s young guns have been put on the Rod Laver Arena yet.
