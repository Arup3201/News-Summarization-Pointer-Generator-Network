A 78-year-old great grandfather has been killed after being struck by a car while trying to save the life of his lifelong friend's dog.

Animal lover Richard Kurtz, from O'Fallon in Missouri, spotted the whippet named Charlie standing without its owner close to the busy Highway N, and decided to cross the road and carry him to safety.

Tragically Mr Kurtz was struck by a vehicle within seconds of reaching Charlie and died from his injuries while still holding the dog, which was also killed.

Mr Kurtz was struck while crossing the eastbound section of Highway N at about 1pm on Monday.

The retired landscape gardener's body was found with the small dog still in his arms.

'It was just a shock to the family... he picked the dog up in his arms to start walking across and as he got in the middle of the road, some car was coming up, and it plowed right into him,' his sister Kathleen Tuttle told the New York Daily News.

'He was an animal lover and you'd teach your children to never do that but you know, when that happened, he didn't think of himself, he thought of the dog,' she added.

Mr Kurtz - who recently underwent spinal surgery - was the father of three children, grandfather of 10, and great-grandfather of two - with a third great-grandchild due in the next couple of weeks.

In the aftermath of his his death, one of Mr Kurtz's granddaughters wrote a tribute message on the official Facebook page of O'Fallon Police Department.

'My papa was an amazing man. He would go after any dog that ran across that road, he would put his life in danger to save anybody,' she said.

Reacting to anger online over the death, she added: 'Please don't blame the driver for anything. My papa knows he tried to stop and I couldn't imagine. The driver now has to carry that with him for the rest of his life. The driver was also an elderly and would've done anything to save my papa.'

Mr Kurtz's wife died four years ago and he had since retired from his family's landscape gardening business.

In 1977 he and his brother were given an award at the White House by the then First Lady Rosalynn Carter for their work on the gardens at St. Louis Community College in Florissant Valley, Missouri.
