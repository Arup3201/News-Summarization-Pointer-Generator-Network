Andy Murray, one of Team GB's strong podium hopefuls, has moved within one match of securing at least a silver medal at the Olympic Games after dismantling Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in today's quarter-final.

The Scot - who lost only a month ago in the Wimbledon final to Roger Federer - is desperate to earn a gold medal at the Games after his plucky defeat at SW19, and must progress through the semi-final and the final to fulfill his dream.

Serbia's Novak Djokovic or France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga await the Scot now, and he could meet world No 1 Federer in the final.

Winner: Andy Murray progressed to the semi-finals with ease

Easy: Murray must expect tougher opposition if he is to get the elusive Olympic gold

Being cheered on by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, his Mother, Judy, and girlfriend Kim Sears - the Scot sought to take the game to his opponent.Â 

Murray was out of the blocks flying, and was a break up after Almagro's third service game, breaking the Spaniard to love.

The Spaniard scuppered his chances to 
get back into the game by double-faulting, handing the Team GB player 
the initiative, and Murray dominated the opening set from there on, as 
Almagro appeared to be struggling with a shoulder injury.

Before the match Murray was a strong 
favourite to win against Almagro, who is ranked 10th in the ATP tour, 
and the Spaniard looked out of sorts against the Team GB player.

Thank heavens for that: Murray did his signature salute to the skies after winning against Almagro

Great Britain's No 1 fought back in the last round to see off old foe Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in three sets after a tense encounter.

The 26-year-old had to turn the match on its head after going a set down to the wily European.

But Almagro provided no such resistance.
After a routine first set, which Murray took 6-4, the Spaniard appeared
to be suffering further with his shoulder.

Murray did not let up on the world No 10, and hammered him in the second set 6-1 after breaking to love in the first game.

After winning he threw his wrist bands in the air, and roared before his signature salute to the skies before leaving the court, proving just how much an Olympic podium place would mean to him.

The Briton has an unbelievably busy Olympic schedule, as he is due to partner up with Laura Robson in the mixed-doubles, and if he wants to get on the podium twice, he must play two more singles matches and four mixed doubles matches before Sunday.

Sea of colour: The British turned up to watch the action unfold on centre court

Making her way down: The Duchess of Cambridge makes her way through the crowd to get to her seats as William follows closely behind

The pair were handed a wildcard entry into the Games yesterday, and regardless what happens in the match with Almagro, will be on centre court this evening.

After his tearful Wimbledon final defeat to Federer, Murray is on course to take an Olympic medal one way or the other. But with Djokovic or Tsonga lying in wait, it will still be tough for the Scot to achieve gold or silver.

Federer meanwhile must make his way through American John Isner later today. Although many of the big names - Isner, Tsonga, Djokovic and Federer - may stand in Murray's way, current Olympic champion Rafael Nadal was ruled out with a knee injury.

But British fans should be thankful that Rafael Nadal was ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury he sustained in the French Open.

The Spaniard was due to bear the flag for his nation in the opening ceremony, but struggled to overcome the injury he sustained on his way to winning the French Open.

William and Kate arrived at court one shortly before play got under way in the third seed's quarter final match against Spain's Nicolas Almagro.

Eyes for each other: William and Kate seemed distracted as they chatted between points in the match

Ouch: Almagro seemed to be suffering from a shoulder strain as he succumbed to defeat by Murray

Kate, wearing a royal blue dress, navy blazer and dark glasses, smiled as the crowd greeted the couple with a round of applause as they took their seats in the stand.

William, also wearing a navy blazer, chatted to spectators sitting nearby.

Murray was given an even greater reception as the match began, with the partisan crowd waving Union flags and roaring at every point he won.

The couple clapped enthusiastically as Murray took the lead in the first set, while support for the 25-year-old Wimbledon 2012 finalist also came from his mother Judy Murray and girlfriend Kim Sears.

The tennis is the latest in a number of Olympic events attended by William and Kate, who earlier this week visited the athletes' village to meet members of Team GB.

Full house: Although there were a few empty seats at the beginning of the contest, the stands soon filled up

The Duke and Duchess looked relaxed as they chatted to each other between the points, and seemed happy to join in the fun with the crowd, taking part in the Mexican waves which spread around the stands during the change-overs.

The couple rose to their feet when Murray clinched victory and were given another round of applause as they left the stands, while Murray walked off the court to deafening cheers.

Despite the crowd's enthusiasm for the British number one's Olympics bid, there were still rows of empty seats in the stands, particularly in the lower tiers.

Hundreds of fans visiting the All England Club without tickets to the match gathered outside the court on Murray Mound to watch the action on the big screen.
