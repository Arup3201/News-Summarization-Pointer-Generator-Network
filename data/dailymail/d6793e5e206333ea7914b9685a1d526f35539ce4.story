Arsenal broke a two year old record in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday by completing 741 passes in their 3-0 victory at Aston Villa.

On Tuesday night at the Emirates it was the turn of Arsene Wenger’s men to be passed off the park.

Beaten at their own game by Southampton, how about that? What a lesson this was. 

Nathaniel Clyne lets fly from 25 yards with a swerving strike that put Southampton into the lead, although goalkeeper David Ospina should have done better

Southampton dished it out, deserving winners after a towering performance from Morgan Schneiderlin in the centre of their midfield.

Goodness knows how Saints clung on to him in the summer when Tottenham were trying to take him to White Hart Lane, but they did.

He, like many others in Ronald Koeman’s team, played like a man possessed.

Meet a Southampton supporter in the street today and they will stop you in your tracks to tell you about the moment time stood still when Nathaniel Clyne took a touch 30 yards out.

It came in the 39th minute, when the score was one-apiece and Arsenal’s defence failed to chase down the Southampton defender when they cleared a corner.

Clyne took a touch and unleashed a thunderbolt, smashing it beyond David Ospina, making his debut in Arsenal’s goal, to put Southampton ahead. It has gone down in Southampton folklore.

Goodness knows how Clyne is consistently overlooked by England manager Roy Hodgson, but this rocket can only add to the Ready Brek glow around the Southampton right-back.

Koeman’s team exposed Arsenal, playing on their fragile confidence and scarring them with with this thrilling victory.

Even when they fell behind to Alexis Sanchez’s stunning free-kick in the 14th minute, Southampton didn’t panic. What a quality to have.

Sanchez, pulling his shorts up so tight they looked like a pair of budgie smugglers before he took the free-kick, pinged it off his right book and into the top corner. Forster didn’t move. 

Arsenal fielded a young defence, Isaac Hayden one of three 19-year-olds in the back four, alongside Calum Chambers, Hector Bellerin and 23-year-old Francis Coquelin

Sanchez is fast becoming a firm favourite among the Arsenal fans, and has scored in his last three games at the Emirates Stadium

‘1-0 to the Arsenal’ sang a hesitant Emirates crowd, almost full to the rafters after selling tickets to their young supporters for a tenner a pop. The lead didn’t last long.

Tomas Rosicky, captaining Arsenal in the absence of Mikel Arteta, gave away a penalty when he clipped the legs of Southampton debutant Sadio Mane. Penalty, no question.

Dusan Tadic scored, his first in a Southampton shirt, with a spot kick drilled straight down the centre of Ospina’s goal. The Arsenal keeper moved way too early.

With Schneiderlin bossing it in the centre of the park, Arsenal’s midfield was muffled. Rosicky, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby, returning from a long spell out through injury, were miles off the pace. Miles off.

It is difficult to even try to explain what Lukas Podolski was doing out on the left for Arsenal, other than to say he was disinterested.

He shouldn’t play for this club, not if he is going to disrespect the red shirt like this.

There is also no place in the game for Sanchez, possibly the only player who looked capable of doing something to bring Arsenal back into the tie, waving an imaginary yellow card at the referee. 

Tomas Rosicky captained Arsenal on his first start of the season but gave away a penalty when he made a silly tackle on Southampton debutant Sadio Mane

Dusan Tadic converted from the spot to put Southampton level, going down the middle of the goal to beat Arsenal's new goalkeeper David Ospina

Jack Wilshere passes the ball away from a Sadio Mane tackle. The England star was part of a strong attacking line-up fielded by Arsene Wenger 

There was no need for the gesture when Victor Wanyama brought him down. The Southampton midfielder was going into Keith Stroud’s book come what may.

This was a pedestrian Arsenal performance, lacking vigour and struggling to make an impression on this tie after Tadic’s equaliser from the penalty spot.

In Calum Chambers, Isaac Hayden, Francois Coquelin and Hector Bellerin, Arsenal fielded an inexperienced defence, but that is not to excuse them. They played because Wenger believes they are ready.

Chambers, signed from Southampton in the summer, remains on course to become a top class player at this level. He doesn’t have the experience yet to guide this team through difficult times.

Southampton are hot, sitting pretty in second place in the Barclays Premier League and proof that there is life beyond Mauricio Pochettino.

Koeman did a proper number on Arsenal, fielding a near full strength team and taking advantage of the hesitancy that shows on the faces of Wenger’s players in times of distress. 

Sadio Mane was impressive on his Southampton debut, battling hard as Southampton dominated the midfield against another lightweight Arsenal performance

Fraser Forster made some good saves in the Southampton goal but in truth he was not tested enough by an Arsenal side with plenty of attacking talent

Arsenal had enough experience to call on, with Podolski, Sanchez, Wilshere and Rosicky providing emotional support for some of the younger players.

Sadly these kids struggled to make an impact, unable to muster enough courage and good fortune to bring Arsenal back into the tie.

Wenger sent for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Santi Cazorla to save them from the substitutes’ bench, but by then it all felt too late.

Sadly for Arsenal this one passed them by.
