The four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together for the first time since 1215.

Copies of the document - one of the first steps in the journey towards parliamentary democracy - will go on show together at The British Library in central London to mark the 800th anniversary since it was signed.

More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them with 1,215 winning the opportunity to visit the display.

World first: The four surviving copies of the Magna Carta (British Library copies, top left and bottom right, Salisbury Cathedral copy, top right, Lincoln Cathedral copy, bottom left) have been reunited in London for the first time for a hotly anticipated new exhibition

Historic: King John's 800-year-old seal at the bottom of The British Library's Canterbury Magna Carta

Disappointed: Of the more than 40,000 people who entered a public ballot for the chance to see them only 1,215 will get the opportunity

The documents will be at the library for three days before they are taken to the House of Lords for another day, then two will be returned to the library and the others go back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals.

King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history.

What is Magna Carta?

Magna Carta is an 800-year-old document containing the idea that no-one is above the law, and it still forms the foundation of many modern ideas and documents today.

What does Magna Carta mean?

It means 'Great Charter' in Latin. In fact the whole document is in Latin.

When and where was Magna Carta granted?

Magna Carta was first drawn up in 1215, granted by King John on June 15 at Runnymede near the River Thames in Surrey.  

Why was Magna Carta first written and granted?  

It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war.  

Is it true that King John never 'signed' Magna Carta?

Yes, at least not in the way we think of signing. Back in the Middle Ages kings never signed their name on documents to pass them into law. Instead John used his Great Seal to authenticate the document. 

How much of Magna Carta is relevant today?

The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books.

Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial.

Meaning 'The Great Charter', it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial. 

The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today, giving all citizens the right to justice and a fair trial.

It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.' 

Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived.

The Magna Carta influenced not only Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, but also the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964. 

In a joint statement as they brought the four surviving copies together, the library and the cathedrals said: 'King John could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of Magna Carta when he agreed to its terms in 1215.

'Eight hundred years later, the international interest and excitement about this unification event is testament to the extraordinary significance and symbolic power of these four manuscripts.

'We are thrilled to be staging this moment in history together, as partners, at the start of the 800th anniversary year. For each of our institutions, this unique event marks the beginning of our own celebrations in 2015.

'The British Library, Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral will all be staging exhibitions and events later this year to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of this iconic document.'

Royal approval: King John signed with a seal the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history

Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain.

Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. 

The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753.

One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact.. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. 

The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s.

The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history.

The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. 

On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.
