It tapped into the dreams of every English football fan.

But a spoof advert for the vacant England manager’s job has been taken down today after attracting 100 excited but now disappointed applicants.

The joke ad, posted on a major recruitment website, said people should only apply if they have the calibre to 'succeed in a major international tournament' and can 'beat Germany.'

In a nod to bookies' favourite and Spurs boss Harry Redknapp's recent aquittal for alleged tax evasion, it said the new manager would have 'exemplary tax histories' and needed to be 'currently occupying a top 3 Premier League position.'

But now it has had to be taken down after
 other clients advertising on prweek.com complained their jobs might 
also be seen as a joke.

It was viewed a staggering 25 times more than any other vacancy on the site after it was placed on Thursday night but was taken down within 24 hours.

Joke: The advert, pictured, was placed online and a flurry of excited football fans applied for the job

The 'rare opportunity' was described as based at Wembley with some international travel but candidates must be able to be at home in the public eye and cope with heckling in the street.

It alluded that England's new manager must also solve the age-old problem of playing Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Chelsea's Frank Lampard in the same team.

A perk of the job is that the successful applicant would get free travel for themselves and also their wag, it said.

It read: 'Understanding the beautiful game from grass roots level upwards, you should be the type of person who thrives under pressure and is totally at home in the public eye, whether this is at an official interview or street heckling.

Top job: Stuart Pearce, left, is the temporary manager of England but Harry Redknapp is the huge favourite for the role

'Joining a high pressured yet rewarding working environment, our client invests heavily in staff development with great benefits to match, including: Extensive “paid for” travel (wags included); expansive, state-of-the-art, new office location; excellent holiday entitlement; free entry to all football games (and some concerts) and a globally competitive salary.

'Please note: We are particularly interested in hearing from English Club Managers with exemplary tax histories currently occupying a top 3 Premier League position. Previous applicants need not apply.'

The vacancy received a huge 6,176 views compare to the site’s average 235 views per vacancy.

One application read: 'I have successfully taken Ebbsfleet Town to the 
brink of European domination within nine years on Football Manager.'

Another applicant wrote: 'I will re-introduce oranges at half time, 
bring in Adam Sandler as the water boy, take on David Beckham as my PA 
and request that lycra boxers shorts is the necessary training dress 
code.'

But despite the fun, the company said the advert had to go.

Gone: Fabio Capello quit as England Manager this week just four months before Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine

Jess Wain, Senior Sales Executive, said: 'We had a complaint from another one of our clients.

'We thought that was a fair enough complaint and we are a professional business so we took it down. It was good while it lasted.”

Richard Hamilton, manager director of Guru who posted the fake ad said they received applications from a spoof Sven-Goran Eriksson, David Pleat, and the real-life favourite Harry Redknapp.

He said: 'People have included their management history from computer game Football Manager their applications to prove why they have the experience for the job.'

On Wednesday Redknapp and his chairman at Portsmouth Milan Mandaric, 73, were cleared of all charges of tax evasion by a trial jury at Southwark Crown Court, London.

Later the same day England manager Fabio Capello, 65, handed in his resignation to the FA, following showdown talks over comments he made to the Italian media in relation to John Terry’s suspension as captain of the national side.

The FA chose to remove Terry, 31, from the position when the CPS announced he would not face trial for a racially aggravated public order offence, until after the European Championships being held in Poland and the Ukraine this summer.

Terry is accused of using racially offence language towards QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, 26, during Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat at Loftus Road on October 23.
