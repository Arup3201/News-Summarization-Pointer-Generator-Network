A public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to £10,000 if a bill that comes up for a first vote this month becomes law in Russia.

The legislation being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as  ‘propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, 
bisexuality and transgenderism.’

It includes a ban on holding public 
events that promote gay rights.

The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West.  Picuttured: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in Moscow

The bill is part of an effort to promote traditional Russian values as opposed to Western liberalism, which the Kremlin and church see as corrupting Russian youth and contributing to a wave of protest against President Vladimir Putin's rule, Fox News reported.

Other laws that the Kremlin says are intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘extremist’ or unfit for young audiences.

Denis Volkov, a sociologist with the Levada Center, an independent pollster, says the anti-gay bill fits the ‘general logic’ of a government intent on limiting various rights.

But in this case, the move has been met mostly with either indifference or open enthusiasm by average Russians.

Levada polls conducted last year 
show that almost two thirds of Russians find homosexuality ‘morally 
unacceptable and worth condemning.’

About half are against gay rallies and
 same-sex marriage; almost a third think homosexuality is the result of 
‘a sickness or a psychological trauma,’ the Levada surveys show.

Russia's widespread hostility to homosexuality is shared by the political and religious elite.

Lawmakers have accused homosexuals of
 decreasing Russia's already low birth rates and said they should be 
barred from government jobs, undergo forced medical treatment or be 
exiled.

Orthodox activists criticised U.S. company PepsiCo for using a ‘gay’ rainbow on cartons of its dairy products.

An executive with a government-run 
television network said in a nationally televised talk show that 
homosexuals should be stopped from donating blood, sperm and organs for 
transplants, while after death their hearts should be burned or buried.

The anti-gay sentiment was seen 
Sunday in Voronezh, a city south of Moscow, where a handful of gay 
activists protesting against the parliament bill were attacked by a much
 larger group of anti-gay activists who hit them with snowballs.

In a gay rights protest in December, Pavel Samburov, founder of gay-rights group the Rainbow Association, was pelted with eggs by militant activists with the Orthodox Church seconds after he and his boyfriend kissed.

He was arrested by police, fined £10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre.

The Orthodox activists were also rounded up, but were released much earlier.

Those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from ‘homosexual propaganda’ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically.

The bill reads: ‘This propaganda goes through the mass media and public events that propagate homosexuality as normal behavior'.

Russian cities started adopting anti-gay laws in 2006. Only one person has been prosecuted so far under a law specifically targeted at homosexuals: Nikolai Alexeyev, a gay rights campaigner, was fined the equivalent of £100 after a one-man protest last summer in St. Petersburg.

In November, a St. Petersburg court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trade Union of Russian Citizens, a small group of Orthodox conservatives and Putin loyalists, against pop star Madonna.

The group sought £6.7million in damages for what it says was ‘propaganda of perversion’ when Madonna spoke up for gay rights during a show three months earlier.

The federal bill's expected adoption comes 20 years after a Stalinist-era law punishing homosexuality with up to five years in prison was removed from Russia's penal code as part of the democratic reforms that followed the Soviet Union's collapse.

Most of the other former Soviet republics also decriminalised homosexuality, and attitudes toward gays have become a litmus test of democratic freedoms.

Russian special police forces arrest a homosexual activist. Homosexuals are subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia

While gay pride parades are held in the three former Soviet Baltic states, all today members of the European Union, same-sex love remains a crime in authoritarian Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

In Russia, homosexuals have been subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia.

There are no reliable estimates of how many gay men and women live in Russia, and only a few big cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg have gay nightclubs and gyms. Even there, homosexuals do not feel secure.
