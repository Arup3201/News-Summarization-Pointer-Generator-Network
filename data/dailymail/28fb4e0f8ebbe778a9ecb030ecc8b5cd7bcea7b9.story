The 'broken windows' law
enforcement strategy of aggressively pursuing petty criminals is
coming under attack, after a grand jury this week decided not to
indict a New York police officer in the chokehold death of an
unarmed black man.

Eric Garner died in July after a confrontation with police.
Officers tried to arrest Garner based on complaints that he was
illegally selling cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk.

The clash between Garner and police, captured on video, has
stoked a debate over the 'broken windows' concept that says
police should pursue small violations to create a larger
atmosphere of obedience and prevent other, more destructive
crimes.

Furious: Protesters have staged a third night of rallies in New York following a grand jury's decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner

The idea dates back to the early 1980s and was popularized
by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican who governed the
city from 1994 to 2001. 

Giuliani's first police commissioner was
Bill Bratton from 1994 to 1996 and Bratton is in the same
position under current Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.

Some say the theory has evolved into a zero tolerance policy
that has led to disproportionate responses by police.

Speaking out: Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out against what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes

U.S. Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat who represents
a largely minority community in New York City, said on Friday
that he has asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate New
York's policing for small crimes.

'We should carefully evaluate how 'broken windows' is being
implemented in practice and how its enforcement may be
infringing on people's civil rights,' Serrano said.

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment on
Serrano's request.

Republicans this week also questioned whether police are
appropriately focusing their attention. Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky blamed laws such as New York City's cigarette taxes
that give rise to illegal sales and other bad behavior.

'I think, my goodness, do we not have enough violence going
on in our community that really needs to be policed that we're
going to go harass people for selling cigarettes?' Paul said on
Fox News on Thursday.

Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out
against what she called a disproportionate response to minor
crimes.

Hands up: U.S. House Member Hakeem Jeffries, a black congressman from Brooklyn, New York, said he views some 'bad apple' police officers as a threat to his son. Jeffries called the Grand Jury's decision a 'stunning miscarriage of justice'

Broken policing: In the ’90s, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. There’s little evidence that theory is correct

'When you have a man who was committing an arguably
low-level offense end up dead because of the use of lethal
force, you have an issue,' Gillibrand said on MSNBC on Friday.

Police backers say programs like New York's 'stop and frisk'
sets the standard that bad behavior will not be tolerated and
has reduced violent crime rates. 

Rudy Giuliani:  The former mayor built his career on scaring white New Yorkers with fears of black criminals

Last year, however, a  federal
judge found the city's use of that strategy constituted a form
of illegal racial profiling, and ordered major changes. 

The broken windows theory was introduced by two social
scientists in a 1982 magazine article and gained traction in New
York. 

It posits that poorly maintained urban environments with
dirty streets, abandoned buildings and the like attract crime,
while well-kept communities are more law-abiding.

Giuliani, who is largely credited with popularizing the
strategy, could not be reached for comment on Friday. 

He said on
Fox News on Thursday that the police response to Garner was
justified because he did not cooperate with law enforcement.

But critics say police have stretched the theory beyond its
original intent into an indiscriminate zero-tolerance policy.

'If the problem is a broken window they should fix the
window,' said City University of New York law school professor
Steve Zeidman. 'But somehow we don't fix the window, we just
arrest people who start hanging out by the broken window.'

Stuart Gang, a retired New York City police officer,
defended the doctrine, saying it has increased the
responsiveness of law enforcement to a range of crimes. 

'There
is nothing wrong with 'broken windows',' he said.
