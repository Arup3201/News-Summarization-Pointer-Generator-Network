England stalwart Peter Reid has called upon Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson to be given the key role of becoming Roy Hodgon’s long-term holding midfielder – rather than Jack Wilshere.

Reid believes finding the right “destroyer” is the biggest question left for Hodgson after the 2-0 win in Switzerland.

Man in the middle: Jordan Henderson should be England's holding midfielder, according to Peter Reid

He admitted: ‘I am not sure about Wilshere in the holding midfield role. 

'We have good forward players like Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana to come back but at the other end, when Phil Jones lost the ball at 0-0, if we were against top quality opposition, we would have been 1-0 down.

‘That extra defensive shield is my one area of concern but we have time to improve on that. I think Henderson could go in there, he has great leg and could do a job.’

Reid’s 1986 World Cup team-mate Bryan Robson agreed as they spoke at the Soccerex Global convention in Manchester.

‘I think you have to be good defensively to play that holding midfield role. Can Wilshere do that?’
