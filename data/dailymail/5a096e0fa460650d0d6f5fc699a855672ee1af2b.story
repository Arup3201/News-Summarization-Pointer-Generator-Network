Mafia boss: Domenico Rancadore, who was arrested in Uxbridge, west London, was denied bail today

A fugitive Mafia boss wanted by the 
Italian authorities told officers who arrested him 'I’m not going back, 
they will kill me', a court heard.

Domenico Rancadore, 64, is wanted in Italy to serve a seven-year jail term for his role in the criminal underworld.

The mafia boss who fled to Britain in 1995, a chauffeur with a host of celebrity and business 
clients, was arrested in his semi-detached bungalow he shares with his wife in Uxbridge, west London, earlier this month.

Dubbed 'The Professor', he is reputed to have been the 'capo' - or boss - of the Cosa Nostra in the criminal heartland of Trabia, Sicily.

Rancadore was denied bail for a second time at Westminster Magistrates’ Court 
today after Prosecutor Aaron Watkins said there were 'overwhelming 
grounds' to suspect he would go on the run if he was released.

Mr
Watkins said it was 'telling' that the former teacher, who was living 
under the assumed name Marc Skinner, had expressed his unwillingness to 
return to Italy to uniformed police officers.

Rancadore
wore a rugby shirt and clutched a white Bible as a female interpreter 
translated District Judge Quentin Purdy’s rejection of his request for 
bail.

He shook his head and exchanged glances with English wife Anne Skinner, who sat in the public gallery.

The court heard that he had offered Mrs Skinner’s home in Uxbridge as a surety for bail, in addition to £10,000.

But District Judge Purdy said: 'It seems to me clear that if you are released on bail there is a risk you will disappear.

'Your
family has every reason to support you in that course of action. I can 
see no grounds to grant you bail and be satisfied that you will return.'

Mr Purdy said Rancadore would appear before the same court via video link on September 20.

Westminster
Magistrates' Court was told earlier this month that Rancadore was a 
leader in a murderous gang that 'spread terror in Sicily'.

But
defence barrister Alun Jones QC questioned today whether he had a 
senior role, saying that 'someone in Italy has thought "We'd better 
ratchet up the pressure"' to give that impression.

Telling
the court that Rancadore suffered from hyptertension, angina and 
reflux, he said: 'In our submission a man in this condition, with family
ties to this country, with his wife's house and £10,000, is not going 
to abscond.'

Acknowledging 
that his client had been living under an assumed name, which he has used
to get treatment from the NHS, he said: 'His case is that he has used 
the name of Skinner because he has no trust in the Italian legal 
authorities.'

Mr Jones said 
that Rancadore was the only defendant who had not been acquitted of 
Mafia organisation charges that required the involvement of three or 
more people.

He was 
convicted of Mafia links in Italy in his absence after he came to live 
in the UK with his family in 1993, the court has previously heard.

He
had been acquitted of previous Mafia charges that year after spending 
months in custody and more than two years under house arrest.
