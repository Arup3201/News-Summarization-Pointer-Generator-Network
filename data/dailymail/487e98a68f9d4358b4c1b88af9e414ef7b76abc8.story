Mindy Tran had just locked the front door of her home in Lawrence, Massachusetts, when she turned around and saw her car rolling down the steep driveway.

With her two-year-old twin daughters strapped into the backseat, and a busy road below, she instantly sprung into action.

'I knew it was either mine or their (lives),' the teary 22-year-old told WCVB.

Courageous: Mindy Tran, 22, used herself as a human speed bump after the car carrying her two daughters started rolling down the driveway into a busy street. She has crushed her right knee and dislocated her left from the hip

'My daughters are my everything': Mindy Tran said her first instinct was to save her twins, and that she didn't think twice before throwing herself behind the car

The 22-year-old had only recently moved into this house in Lawrence, Massachusetts, when the incident occurred. The car was in the garage when it started rolling backwards

Dangerous: The car would have rolled onto the busy Marsten St

'My first instinct was that I had to push the car back into the driveway.'

She jumped behind the car and physically tried to change its course.

The car fought against her, trapping one leg and then the other.

'I had to use myself as a speed bump to slow it down enough for one of my neighbors to get in and completely stop the car,' she said.

Fortunately, a nearby neighbor saw what was happening and ran to Tran's aid.

They jumped into the car and managed to pull the brake on and get the kids out of the car.

Despite numerous surgeries on both legs, which were trapped under the car, Mindy Tran still has more to come

Scene: Steepness of the driveway meant the car would have certainly have rolled into the busy street below

However Tran remained trapped underneath it.

Firefighters arrived at the scene and used wooden blocks and an airbag to lift the vehicle off Tran.

Her right knee was crushed and her left leg was dislocated from her hip, however all that really matters is the safety of her family.

'My daughters are my everything,' she said.

'It was all for my kids. I'm just glad my kids are fine.'
