Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata feels Radamel Falcao's goal against Aston Villa was just rewards for all of his hard work, but admitted being frustrated after only managing a draw on Saturday.

Falcao has endured a frustrating start to life in Manchester after completing a shock transfer deadline day loan move to Old Trafford from Monaco.

A persistent knee problem kept the Colombia striker out of the team for the majority of November, and he has been restricted to cameos off the bench the past few games.

Mata did his best to try to break down Villa to find a winner, but couldn't pass his way through a tight midfield

United were closed down at every opportunity on Saturday, which was testament to Villa's work-rate

However, on his first league start since September, 28-year-old Falcao headed his second goal for the club, and Mata was pleased to see the South American back amongst the goals.

'We were able to tie the game thanks to Radamel’s header - I’m very happy for him,' Mata said.

'I think he deserved it because he works hard every day.'

United were looking to make it seven wins in a row at Villa Park, but a much-improved Villa were good value for the draw, despite having to play the final 25 minutes with 10 men.

Boss Louis van Gaal talked of feeling like it was two points dropped, and Mata also admitted that it was a real chance missed on Saturday.

'Our goal is to finish the year in the best possible way: with two more victories,' Mata added.

'Against Aston Villa, we couldn’t get our seventh win in a row. It was a complicated game.

'They scored first, a great goal from Christian Benteke and didn’t leave much space for us to come back.'
