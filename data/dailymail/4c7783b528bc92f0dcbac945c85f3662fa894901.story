William is following in the trail blazing footsteps of his father when it comes to the birth of his first child.

Charles broke with the long standing tradition of royal births being kept both intensely private and totally removed from involvement of the father.

By encouraging Diana to give birth in hospital rather than in one of the royal palaces, and remaining by her side during the birth, Charles set a modern precedent for the family.

The photographs taken on the steps of
 St Mary's hospital as the young royal couple left the private Lindo 
Wing holding their young son have become iconic.

Now
 we are set to see a touching repeat of history as William and Kate will
 likely be introducing their first born son to the waiting media in a 
similar manner.

While
 their privacy is carefully protected within the hospital walls, this 
modern trend for royal hospital births means that the first pictures of new members 
of the royal family are usually on the front steps as they leave the 
hospital for the first time.

In contrast, Queen Elizabeth was born at her private
 family home, 17 Bruton Street in London, and gave birth to her sons 
Charles, Andrew and Edward in Buckingham Palace and Princess Anne at 
Clarence House.

Prince Charles broke with the Royal tradition by attending both hospital births of William and Harry.

Previous royal births had happened in the Palaces, with the father not present at the actual delivery.

In a letter he wrote to his 
godmother, Patricia Brabourne, Prince Charles expressed his joy at 
having been present at the birth of his sons, saying: 'I am so thankful I
 was beside Diana's bedside the whole time because by the end of the day
 I really felt as though I'd shared deeply in the process of birth.'

When Princes Charles himself was 
born, Prince Phillip was reported off playing squash in the palace, and 
not by the Queen's side.

Last night a delighted Charles said: 
‘Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild.
 It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine and we are
 so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy,’ he said.

The clearly overwhelmed prince added:
 ‘Grandparenthood is a unique moment in anyone’s life, as countless kind
 people have told me in recent months, so I am enormously proud and 
happy to be a grandfather for the first time and we are eagerly looking 
forward to seeing the baby in the near future.’

In its official statement Kensington 
Palace said : ‘Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely 
delivered of a son at 4.24pm.

‘The baby weighs 8lbs 6oz.

‘The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth.'

Kate is expected to be discharged 
from St Mary's as early as lunchtime today, when the world will get its 
first glimpse of the new member of the royal family.
