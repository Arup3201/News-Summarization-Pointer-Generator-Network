Trainer Michael Scudamore is hoping a breathing operation will make the crucial difference between Next Sensation winning the Grand Annual Chase after last year’s near miss.

The eight-year-old put in a spectacular front-running performance in the Festival finale before fading into fourth beaten one and three-quarter lengths by Savello.

It was initially hoped the improving gelding might even be up to challenging the top two-mile chasers this season but he has failed to win in four runs, most recently at Newbury in November. Consequently, he lines up in the Grand Annual off a mark only 1lb higher than he raced off 12 months ago.

Scudamore, who also plans to saddle Grand National contender Monbeg Dude at the Festival, said: ‘He had a racecourse gallop and that went very well and a breathing operation since his last run.

‘Hopefully, that and better ground we will see him back to somewhere he should be.

‘He hates the soft ground and every time we have run him this year it has nearly been heavy. We actually thought he ran a great race at Newbury considering the conditions.’

Sponsors William Hill make David Pipe’s Bidourey 6-1 favourite to preserve his unbeaten record in the Imperial Cup at Sandown on Saturday.

Bidourey holds Festival entries in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle and Triumph Hurdle and would secure a £100,000 bonus if he manages to win the Imperial Cup and go on to success at Cheltenham.

Pipe has won the Imperial Cup three times in the last 10 years, twice with four-year-olds – Gaspara in 2007 and Ashkazar in 2008.

Gaspara successfully secured the bonus with success in the Fred Winter but Ashkazar was second.

Irish trainer Gordon Elliott has booked crack amateur jockey Jamie Codd to ride Cause of Causes in the four-mile National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival.

The seven-year-old, who was second in last year’s Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase, looks to have been trained specifically for the race have run only three times since, most recently over hurdles.
