At its launch event in September, Apple boss Tim Cook said prices for the firm's upcoming watch would start at $349 - but he refused to go into more detail.

Now, French website iGen.fr has been told by a 'reliable source' that the stainless steel model will be available from $500, while the gold version will set customers back up to $5,000.

And the source also revealed the firm is on track to release its first wearable around Valentine's Day, as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release.

French website iGen.fr has been told by a 'reliable source' that the stainless steel model of Apple's Watch will be available from $500, while the gold version (pictured) will set customers back between $4,000 and $5,000

According to a translation of French tech site, which correctly reported Apple was working on two iPhone 6 models earlier this year: 'After cooking one of our most reliable contacts - which obviously wishes to remain anonymous - we can lift the veil a little on the prices.'

But it stressed that it is 'impossible to be absolutely certain of the truth of these indiscretions.'

Apple's Watch will be available in three models: Sport, stainless steel and gold. 

The prices for Apple’s 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display, bought directly from the UK and US Apple stores differ significantly.

In the U.S, the high-end iMac costs $2,503 without state taxes.

When state tax for California is added - a state with one of the highest taxes in the country at an average of 9 per cent - the price increases to $2,727.91.

In addition to this, California laws state that a recycle fee must be added of $4.

This brings the total cost of the order to $2727.91, which converts to £1,704.

By comparison, the total price for the iMac in the UK is £1,999 with VAT of £333.17 already included.

This is a difference of £295.

Within the gold range, users will be able to choose from rose gold and yellow gold, and prices are expected to range between $4,000 and $5,000.

This converts to £2,510 and £3,130, but conversions can't be used to determine global prices because Apple typically sets prices on a region-by-region basis. 

Earlier this week, 9to5Mac reported Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores as saying: 'We’re going into the holidays, we’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming in the spring.'

Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. 

He didn't announce exactly when the watch would be available, but said it would go on sale 'early next year.'

A 'source close to Apple' told The Information last month that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. 

Chinese New Year falls on 19 February next year, so Ms Ahrendts comments push it at least beyond this date. 

Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life.

The telling omission suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it eventually does go on sale. 

The source also revealed Apple is on track to release its first wearable around Valentine's Day, as per previous rumours - dismissing more recent claims of a spring release. Apple's Watch will be available in a Sport model, stainless steel and gold. Within the gold range, users will choose from rose gold (pictured) and yellow gold

Despite reports claiming the watch (pictured with boss Tim Cook) would launch in February, a statement recently suggested it has been delayed until 'spring.' Angela Ahrendts, Apple's senior vice president of retail and online stores said: 'We’ll go into Chinese New Year, and then we’ve got a new watch launch coming'

Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year.  

Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.

Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.  

Apple's Watch will be available in three models: Sport, stainless steel and gold. 

Within the gold range, users will be able to choose from rose gold and yellow gold, and prices are expected to range between $4,000 and $5,000. 

The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’

During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world.

'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.'

The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent.

A source said Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’

Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event in September. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging

A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year.

Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. 

This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use.

Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. 

Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed

Companies including Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements.

However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’

Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. 

Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. 

The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.
