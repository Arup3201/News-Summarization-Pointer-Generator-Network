A teenager has admitted he deeply regrets sexually abusing a girl who was younger than him and below the age of consent.

Louis (not his real name), 17, from Devon, has said he made 'the biggest mistake' of his life when he started a sexual relationship with the daughter of his father's girlfriend.

The college student said the relationship began innocently when he moved in with his father and his new family after his single mother decided he would be better off living with them.

Innocence lost: Now 17, Louis regrets a sexual relationship he had with a younger girl which took place when he was 14 (posed by model)

He said it was a difficult time but becoming an older brother figure to the girl made him feel loved.

He explains: 'My life turned upside down when my mum 
moved away from the area, leaving me to live with my dad who I hadn't 
seen for many years.

'When my mum left me, it felt like I had a piece 
missing for a while and I was left wondering what would happen next; it was a very upsetting time. I was so lonely, upset and confused.

'It was strange getting to know my dad, his partner and her 
children. Dad and his
 partner thought it was good that I could talk to the youngest girl and 
when we went out together as a family we would hold hands like brother 
and sister.'

He added that spending more time with the girl as a sibling led to something more sinister.

He said: 'Our relationship turned into a really close friendship and 
we would spend time together, going out to the park, watching movies - 
it was good until our close friendship turned into a sexual 
relationship.'

Louis was 14 at the time and the girl was younger than him. He said he didn't realise then that what he was doing was wrong and that she wasn't old enough to consent to his advances.

'I thought she was enjoying what we were doing and this led me in the wrong direction,' he now admits.

The abuse was eventually discovered by their parents but Louis said at this stage he still didn't fully comprehend the gravity of the situation or that what he was doing was wrong. His father trying to prevent him from being with the girl only made him want her more.

He said: 'Neither of us told anyone what was 
happening but then I was caught performing indecent behaviour with her. 
Dad and his girlfriend went mad when they caught us and they tried to 
stop me being with her.

'Dad's telling off made me feel like no one cared
 about me other than the girl so things did not change, instead they got
 worse.'

He added: 'When my dad and his partner realised they
 could not stop me getting close to her they called Children's Services 
and the police became involved. Boundaries were put in place to make 
sure the girl and I did not spend time together. But the boundaries 
didn't stop me. I managed to get away with most of what I had done by 
looking for the "golden opportunity" when we were not supervised 
properly, until I was caught again.'

Louis has shared his story as new figures released by the NSPCC have revealed that more than 8,000 under-18s in Britain were
 accused of sexual offences against other children in the last two years.

According to NSPCC figures, most under age victims of sexual abuse knew their alleged abuser and some of the most common crimes were teenage boys attacking female acquaintances

Like Louis's victim, most knew their alleged abuser and some of the most common crimes were teenage boys attacking female acquaintances.

The charity state that whilst these crimes are shocking, this 
behaviour can be turned around if caught early. They offer a 'Turn the Page' programme to help young offenders change their behaviour and stop 
them committing more sexual crimes as they get older.

It was thanks to this intervention from the NSPCC that Louis was able to turn his life around and his victim was also given the full support she needed.

Louis was moved into a foster home to keep him away from the victim and had counselling to help him understand why his behaviour was wrong.

'The NSPCC helped me to see that I was not taking responsibility for what was happening,' he explained. 'I had tricked myself into thinking it was a relationship. NSPCC taught me things like consent and the legal age you can agree to have a sexual relationship and this helped me to realise it was my fault.'

He added that the children's charity helped him get to the root of his own problems and that turning to the girl was not the answer.

Now three years on, he feels full of remorse for what happened and is determined to put the experience behind him and never commit such a crime again.

He said: 'The support I received from the NSPCC has
 helped me recognise that people around me, even people I did not know, 
do care about me. This has made me feel happy and determined to change 
my life.

'I now feel I have the confidence, knowledge and skills to take full responsibility of my life. I only want to move in one direction toward a successful career, a respectful relationship and happy life.'

Louis is an example of how the NSPCC can offer support in horrific circumstances and prevent further abuse.Â 

Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, said: 'It's deeply concerning that thousands of children are committing sexual offences including serious assaults and rape. For young children in particular we have to question the environment in which they are growing up that has led to them behaving in this way.

'Prevention has to be the key and that is recognising warning signs early and taking swift action. It could be that they have seen sexual activity that they are just too young to understand and are copying what they've seen.

'We also know that pornography for many older children is now part of life. Easy access to hard core, degrading and often violent videos on the internet is warping views of what is normal or acceptable behaviour. It is also feeding into "sexting" where teenagers are creating and distributing their own videos and images that are illegal and have led to prison sentences.

'But these children are not beyond help. If we act quickly and children receive therapy such as that provided by the NSPCC's "Turn the Page" service we can stop them becoming adult sex offenders.

'And, most importantly, their victims need support to overcome what has happened to them. Sexual offences, whether committed by another child or an adult, can have lifelong consequences.'

The charity advise parents to help keep their children safe by teaching them the 'Underwear Rule' which is a simple, effective and age appropriate way of telling children what is and isn't acceptable behaviour.

Parents simply tell their children that the area covered by their underwear should never be touched by anyone else.

Any adult worried about a child or in need of help and advice can contact the NSPCC's helpline on 0808 800 5000. Children and young people can contact ChildLine on 0800 1111.
