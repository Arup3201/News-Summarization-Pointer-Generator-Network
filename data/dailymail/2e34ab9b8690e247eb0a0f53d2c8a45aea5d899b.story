Plans to build floating hotels on the Persian Gulf have been put forward to help provide accommodation for the influx of visitors expected in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup.

Qatari authorities have been in talks with a Finnish architecture firm over plans to develop the space-saving floating hotels before the tournament in nine years' time.

Organisers are already planning to spend Â£65billion on air-conditioned stadiums to counter the soaring summer heat, while there have also been plans to blot out the sun with artificial clouds.

Qatar is in talks with a Finnish architecture firm over plans to develop space-saving floating hotels as it prepares for an influx of visitors for the World Cup 2022

The hotels are planned to be built off the coast of Doha, on the Persian Gulf

They will form part of the Oryx Island, which will also feature luxury villas and a water park

And they are now considering developing Oryx Island, which will consist of the floating hotels alongside luxury villas and a water park, off the coast of Doha, in the Persian Gulf, according to ArchDaily.

Sigge Architects have said the Qatari authorities were interested in the concept because of its sustainability and green credentials.

The firm developed the floating hotel with the Almaco Group of Finland, ConstructionWeekOnline has reported.

The Almaco website states that a floating hotel is 'a great alternative for areas where all land is fully developed and/or difficult to develop'.

Water taxis, ferries and private boats will be used to transport the development's 25,000 visitors to the mainland.

The hotel, which could be completed in seven or eight years, will also have its own sewage treatment plant, recycling facilities and will be able to generate its own power.

UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino last week added his voice to growing calls for the tournament to be played in winter, saying it should be held when the weather is most suitable.

Despite plans to build air-conditions stadiums to counter the heat, which can reach 50C, there has still been pressure from some within the football world to play the tournament at a different time of year.

Europe's major leagues, with the Premier League leading, are opposed to the idea as it would mean substantial changes to the schedule but Infantino has followed in the footsteps of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and UEFA chief Michel Platini backing the proposal.

Meanwhile, there have also been plans to blot out the sun with artificial clouds in a bid to provide shade for stadiums and training grounds during the sweltering summer.

The clouds will be made from a 'light weight carbon structure' carrying a giant envelope filled with helium.
