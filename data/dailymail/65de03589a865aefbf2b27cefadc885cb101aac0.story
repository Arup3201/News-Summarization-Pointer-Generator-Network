A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when his bicycle was hit by van has stood up for the first time since the accident.

Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma and fighting for his life after he decided not to wear a helmet for fear it would ruin his hairstyle.

The teenager has remained in hospital since the accident on July 22 last year near the village of Chapel St Leonards, Lincolnshire.

Ryan Smith has stood up for the first time since being knocked off his bike by a van nine months ago

Ryan's parents are now campaigning for a change in the law so cyclists are forced to wear helmets

At the time, his family released a heart-breaking image showing Ryan’s father, Mark, cradling his son’s head as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets.

Then, in November, the family were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time after he came out of his four-month coma.

And yesterday, the family reached another milestone when Ryan defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust’s Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey.

His sister, Rachael, 22, immediately sent the picture of her brother standing to their paramedic father, Mark, 44.

When Ryan was in a coma, his family released this picture to try and encourage cyclists to wear helmets

It was initially feared that Ryan would never wake up. He is pictured with his father when he was in a coma

He said: ‘It was an extremely emotional moment when I saw the picture of Ryan standing unaided - it was a special moment.

‘I was in tears, he is such a fighter, I would not have dreamed he would have come this far in such a small amount of time.

‘He has had quite a remarkable progression, although there is obviously a very long way to go and the movement on his left side is limited, but he isn’t giving up and we are all behind him supporting him.

‘I don’t use the term miracle a lot in my profession but he is becoming somewhat of a miracle.

‘We are still going round to schools and teaching people about how safe it is to wear a cycle helmet and the affects it can have on people who don’t and their families.

A coma is a state of unconsciousness where a person is unresponsive and cannot be woken.

People who are in a coma are alive but have very little brain activity.

Every case is different - some are unable to hear voices while others have some awareness of their environment.

Comas are most often causes by events such as a severe head injury or a stroke.

They can last for hours, days or months.

Some people remain in a coma for years, but this is unusual.

The chances of recovery depend upon how much of the brain has been damaged.

Generally, the longer a person has been in a coma, the poorer the outlook.

People don't usually suddenly wake up from a coma - they come round gradually.

Some will make a full recovery while others will have severe long-term health problems.

‘It is hard to get it debated in parliament, but we will not stop trying to get people to wear them.

‘Right now, we are preparing everything at home, we have a lot of work to do there as Ryan will be leaving Tadworth in two months to come home.

‘We are literally counting down the 
days till we can see him back at home, but we are under no illusions 
that it will be hard work for us and for Ryan.’

The
 Smith family are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear 
helmets after Ryan chose not to wear one due to his fashionable hair style.

Cycle helmets are not compulsory in Britain.

Olympic
 champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed 
calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads.

Former Welsh international footballer John Hartson, 38, who beat testicular cancer in 2009, visited Ryan on his birthday on March 31.

Since seeing Ryan’s story, Hartson 
has taken Ryan on as his ‘adopted son’ according to Mr Smith, and even 
changed his Twitter picture to the pair of them together and asked his 
205,000 followers to support the teen.

Mr Smith added: ‘John Hartson has been magnificent with Ryan and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him.

Ryan was in a coma for four months before he finally woke up in November. He is now going through intensive rehabilitation before he goes home in two months

Ryan is being supported by former footballer John Hartson who has taken him on as an 'adopted son'

‘He has been tweeting and supporting online, he has literally taken on Ryan as his “adopted son” it has been great.

‘When someone that famous helps you out it really gets people behind the cause and makes more people aware.

‘By him doing all of this for us, which he didn’t have to, he wanted to, it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant.’
