Nico Rosberg claims louder Formula One engines, incorporating a 'megaphone' design, have been tested, and will be seen on track for the first time at next week's Barcelona test.

The noise produced by the new 1.6-litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution.

Mercedes, who supply engines to four teams, have led the development process in cooperation with the FIA.

Changes to the exhaust system have since been made and it is understood that the revamped technology, which has involved widening the tail pipe, will be introduced in Barcelona next week.

'Mercedes have done lots of work on trying to make the cars louder and have a greater engine noise,' said Rosberg, who heads into this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix leading the world championship.

'They have come up with good solutions, we have tested them in the factory and they work, so now we will test them on the track next week.

'Then it is a matter for the FIA to get all the teams to agree and try and get the things on the cars.'

Rosberg was hesitant to put a 
timescale on when the louder engines would be introduced, and warned 
that all of the teams would have to reach an agreement before they were 
ratified.

'I 
understand the cars are not loud enough for the fans and that's part of 
the sport's attraction,' added Rosberg. 'It depends on the teams 
agreeing so it is going to take a bit of time.'
