A rock 'n' roll reverend has smashed the record for the world's biggest drum kit - with a staggering 813 individual pieces weighing more than a whopping 5,000 lbs.

Mark Temperato, who goes by the stage name RevM, destroyed the previous record by over 450 extra parts which he has painstakingly assembled over the past 20 years.

To prove the kit is fully-functional and claim the record, drum-crazy Mark had to be able to hit all 800-plus pieces from either a sitting or standing position without taking a step to either side.

Some of the parts are as far as seven or eight feet away from each other and it takes an entire hour for Mark to strike each piece but he insists he knows every sound on the set.

The drum kit, which is made up of mixture of drums, cymbals, cow bells and other bashable pieces is stored in the church where Mark, 56, works and requires up to 17 hours of maintenance a week.

The reverend broke his previous record of 340 pieces with his new 813-piece design - stopping at that number because his birthday falls on August 13.

A Guinness World Record representative confirmed the new record just a few days ago leaving Mark, from Lakeville, New York, already planning spectacular ways to make his kit BIGGER.

Early days: Reverend Temperato is already planning spectacular ways to make his kit BIGGER

He said: "I'm really excited about breaking the record - it's taken a lot of work and many hours finding the right pieces to put together but it's paid off and it looks great.

"Not many people have been on it - it really does has to be seen to be believed quite how big it is.

"If I hit everything at least once it would take an hour so it's quite an effort.

"I need to keep limber to hit things which may be seven or eight feet away but I have memorised everything in my kit.

"There is something in my brain like a pianist has - but they only have to remember 88 keys.

"I have dedicated a lot of hours towards building the kit but my aim is to break the 1,000 part mark.

"It's an honour to be part of Guinness World Records and to inspire youngsters."
