The North Dakota State University student found slain in Moorhead was laid to rest Monday as authorities search for his killer.

About 1,250 mourners attended a funeral Mass for 18-year-old Thomas Bearson at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in his hometown of Sartell.

Family and friends remembered Bearson's humor, caring personality and love for athletics, the St. Cloud Times reported.

'We've tried desperately to make sense of this tragedy,' Bearson's father, Greg Bearson, told mourners. 'The only thing we can come up with is the basketball team in heaven needed a point guard.'

Thomas Bearson's body was found Tuesday outside a recreational vehicle store in Moorhead.

The Ramsey County medical examiner's office says Bearson died as the 'result of homicidal violence.'

Police say Bearson had last been seen at a party early on Sept. 20 in Fargo, North Dakota, about six blocks from his dorm.

NDSU officials are encouraging students to walk with others on and off campus at night.

Police have made no arrests and have no suspects or motive, Moorhead Police Lt. Tory Jacobson said Monday.

Police described the missing items as a white Nike Air Jordan left-foot tennis shoe, size 9 1/2, and a silver iPhone 5.

At Monday's service, family and friends recalled how a toy basketball hoop given to Thomas on his first Christmas - followed with a Little Tikes version after his third birthday - started a lifelong love of basketball.

He worshiped former Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan and played for the Sartell High School basketball team.

'He played basketball for hours,' Greg Bearson said. 'He played in the rain and in the cold. He played in the morning and at night. I'm sure he even played in his dreams.'

His cousin and pallbearer Ryan Walsh also said he had fond memories of playing with Bearson.

'Even last Christmas when it was 20 below, he was still out there playing,' he said. 'Being his older cousin, I always wanted to show Tom that he wasn't as good as he thought he was. Now that he is gone, I have to admit, he was much better than I or my brother.'

His former basketball coach Dave Angell remembered how Thomas missed a game-wining shot only to come back a year later and score the game-winning basket against Albany.

'I told him in the locker room, 'You have to fail in that situation to eventually be successful,' he said.

Sister Maddie Bearson said she trusted her brother to proofread when writing sports stories as a journalism student.

'Being the older sibling, I should have been the role model, but he was a role model to me,' she said. 'Tom didn't have to try hard to be good at something. I admired him growing up. I still do.

'I'm proud to be Tom Bearson's sister.'
