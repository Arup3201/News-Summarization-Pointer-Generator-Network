Mitt Romney's biggest supporter Donald Trump has now turned his attentions to his wife - by creating a one-off birthday cake of her riding a horse.Â 

The billionaire real estate tycoon and his wife Melania did the busy Republican presidential candidate's job for him this year by throwing Ann Romney a huge bash at the Trump Tower in New York yesterday.

And the centrepiece of her 63rd birthday party was a large cake handmade by celebrity chef Buddy Valastro, topped with a sweet-tasting Romney atop a sugary horse in a field of green icing, according to ABC News.

Tasty: The cake with a lifelike Ann Romney on a horse was the centrepiece of a birthday party for her and a $600,000 fundraiser for husband Mitt, thrown by the Trumps

Horse-riding Ann love equestrianism because it helps lessen the impact of her multiple sclerosis.

But it was not all about her, as the glamorous bash attended by at least 400 people was expected to raise around $600,000 for her husband's campaign.

'This birthday party and fundraiser will be the highest-grossing and fastest-selling event to date for the Romney campaign,' executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Michael Cohen said.

'Melania looks forward to spending more time with Ann and hosting this special occasion in two weeks,' he added.

In February Mr Trump threw his considerable influence behind the Romney campaign after months of speculation.

'Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp,' Mr Trump said. 'He's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen in this country we all love. So, Governor Romney, go out and get 'em. You can do it.'

Since then he has done dozens of interviews and appearances in many states backing him.

Accepting his backing Mitt Romney said: 'I've had some success in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy, but successful nonetheless.

'There are some things you just can't imagine happening in your life. This is one of them.'

And this latest event is the icing on the cake for the Romneys.
