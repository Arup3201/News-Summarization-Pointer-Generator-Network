Changes: Education Secretary Michael Gove said the Church of England will help raise educational standards in Britain's schools

The Church of England could be given the power to run thousands of secular state schools after agreeing a landmark deal with the Department of Education.

The Church will be forced to preserve the character of non-faith schools and community schools joining a Church of England academy chain would not have to change its admissions policy, religious education lessons or employment terms for teachers, according to The Times newspaper.

Bishops will also have the power to appoint governors at the schools.

But the move has been criticised by secular groups, who said the decision would irreversibly increase religious influence over state schools.

Keith Porteous Wood, of the National 
Secular Society, told The Times: 'This will surreptitiously bring the 
education system under religious control.

'It will lead to the further 
alienation of school children who are from non-religious or religiously 
unconcerned families.

'Despite now being the majority, they 
are becoming increasingly disadvantaged in admissions and by the growing
 religionisation of publicly-funded schools.

'Once schools have been taken over by 
religious interests, it will be almost impossible to ever bring them 
back under community control.'

Education Secretary Michael Gove praised the standards and popularity of church schools during a seminar at Lambeth Palace yesterday and urged a continuing partnership with the Church.

In a statement Mr Gove said: 'We would not have so many great state schools in this country without the Church of England.

'I know the Church does a wonderful job helping to raise educational standards and in providing a safe and loving environment for hundreds of thousands of children.

'However, there is much more we can do together. I want the Church to recover the spirit which infused its educational mission in Victorian times and support more new schools - especially academies and free schools - to bring educational excellence to the nation's poorest children.'

Approximately one million children currently attend Church of England schools.

Mission: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the move would help the church 'transform every part of our society'

There are 4,484 Church of England primary and middle schools, a quarter of the total, and 193 secondary schools.

The
 Bishop of Oxford, the Right Rev John Pritchard, who leads education 
policy within the Church, believes small village primary schools will 
want to join academy trusts led by its schools to secure their future, 
and promised they would be 'safe with us', The Times said.

Bishop
 Pritchard said: 'This will be a way for them to have the security of a 
larger body with mutual support, with resources that are much more 
extensive.'

He added: 
'Dioceses have the privilege and opportunity to put local church and 
local school into the same box, as it were, and say that's where the 
mission of the Church lies.'

The
 bishop said Mr Gove had set the Church a challenge to 'raise our game',
 which 'echoes our own determination to make a real step change in the 
way we serve our communities, working to the highest standards'.

Bishop
 Pritchard said: 'I think people may not realise the significance of 
what looks like a small technical change but actually allows the mutual 
support, the drawing together of resources, experiments in 
collaboration.

'It allows a whole lot more and it will enhance the educational experience of millions of children.'

The
 Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said the vision 
for church schools would 'continue our mission of transforming every 
part of our society'.

'It is obviously true that good schools help produce an educated workforce,' the Archbishop said.

'But
 the Christian vision is a far greater one. It is about setting a 
framework for children as they learn, which enables them to be confident
 when faced with the vast challenges that our rapidly changing culture 
brings to us.'

Secular groups have expressed concern about the extent of religious influence the move would allow.

Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, chairman of the Accord Coalition, which campaigns for admissions and recruitment in state schools to be free from religious discrimination, said: 'Despite the positive aspects of church schools, those that select pupils on the basis of their faith are not only guilty of discrimination, but also help to fragment society.

'A tolerant pluralist society can only be created by having tolerant pluralist schools where children of all backgrounds grow up and interact together.

'If Michael Gove really wants church schools to recover the spirit which infused the Church's educational mission in Victorian times then he must make sure that church schools are not permitted to segregate and divide, but are made open and suitable for all in their respective local communities.'
