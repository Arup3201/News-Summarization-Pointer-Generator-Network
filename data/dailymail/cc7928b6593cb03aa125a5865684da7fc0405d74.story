Losses: La Bardemcilla, owned by Javier Bardem (pictured with wife Penelope Cruz), his mother Pilar and siblings Monica and Carlos, is closing after 'two years of prolonged losses'

Not even Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem can escape Spain’s economic crisis - which has seen his family forced to close one of its restaurants in Madrid.

La Bardemcilla is shutting up shop 'after two years of prolonged losses', according to a statement put out by the 44-year-old Hollywood star, his siblings Monica and Carlos and mother Pilar.

Eleven workers will lose their jobs when the eatery, situated in the capital’s fashionable Chueca district, closes its doors.

The family’s other restaurant, in the Santa Ana area, will remain open.

EFE news agency reported that the four family business partners had injected cash on several occasions into the ailing business.

But
they have now decided to cut their losses as the model is 
'unsustainable'. It is currently not clear if the staff will receive a 
redundancy pay-out.

The
statement added: 'Like many small businesses, including many small 
firms in this country that no-one rescues, La Bardemcilla is closing its
doors.'

It comes four 
months after Bardem was branded an 'enemy of the state' for suggesting 
to newspaper El Pais that the country’s high jobless total actually 
'suited the government'.

The
actor, who played Daniel Craig’s nemesis Raoul Silva in the latest 
James Bond film Skyfall, was labelled ‘a great villain’ by ruling 
Partido Popular’s Rafael Hernando in Congress.

Bardem, married to 38-year-old 
Penelope Cruz, with whom he has son Leo, won a Best Supporting Actor 
Oscar in 2007 as assassin Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men.

The actor was born in Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands.

The
restaurant’s closure comes three weeks after Spain’s army of unemployed
soared past the five million mark for the first time.

More
than one in four adults, and 56 per cent of 18 to 25-year-olds, are now
out of work - and the country remains in recession for a fifth straight
year.
