A 35-year-old Florida man found not guilty by reason of insanity in the death of a homeless man has been committed to up to 60 years in a Connecticut psychiatric hospital.

In July a
 three-judge panel in Bridgeport agreed that Tyree Lincoln Smith had killed - and partially eaten - homeless man Angel 'Tun Tun' Gonzales, but that he hadn't committed murder per se because he was mentally ill.

The panel met again on Monday to determine what to do with Smith. They could have ordered his release, but Superior Court Judge John Kavanewsky said he believed Smith would be a danger to himself and others if discharged.

Smith stunned the courtroom on Monday when he got up and apologized prior to the panel making their decision.

'I'm really sorry for what I did, that I couldn't be myself,' he said. 'It really had nothing to do with the other person.' 

In the back of the courtroom a relative of Gonzalez, Talitha Frazier, burst into tears.

'We waited two years to hear Tyree say he was sorry,' she told the Connecticut Post. 'What he said today caught me off-guard, but I feel he meant what he said.'

In January 2012 Gonzalez's mutilated body was found on the 
third floor of an abandoned home in Bridgeport, where Smith had lived as
 a child.

Smith came to the attention of authorities when his cousin, Nicole Rabb, contacted Bridgeport police.

She
 told detectives that Smith had arrived at her house on December 15, 
2011, talking about Greek gods and how he wanted to 'get blood on his hands.' Then he said he was going to the
 abandoned home where he used to live, according to an arrest warrant 
affidavit.

The next day, Smith returned to the cousin's house with blood on his pants and he was carrying chopsticks and a bloody axe. Police say he told his cousin he
 had 'gotten his blood'.

Smith
 told his cousin, Nicole Rabb, that he killed Gonzalez with the axe and 
beat the man's face and head.

He said he then collected one
 of his victim's eyes, 'which tasted like an oyster', and some of his 
brain matter and consumed them in a nearby cemetery, washing it down 
with sake, according to court documents.

Smith, at his arraignment in February 2012, had told his cousin that one of his victim's eyes 'tasted like an oyster'

When Smith returned to his cousin's house after killing Gonzalez he had blood on his pants and he was carrying chopsticks and a bloody axe

'Tyree
 told his cousin the blows to Gonzalez's head were so severe that he was
 able to remove an eye from the man's head along with pieces of brain 
matter and a piece of his skull,' the arrest warrant says.

Police later recovered the bloody axe and an empty bottle of sake in a stream bed nearby.

Less than a month 
after the killing, Smith was treated and released from St. Vincent's 
Medical Center's Behavioral Health Services in Westport, Connecticut after being 
discovered in a pharmacy bleeding from his wrist, which police said he 
had slashed with a box cutter.

He was eventually discharged and returned to Florida, where he was arrested on Jan. 23, 2012, and charged with murder.

The defense's case rested mainly on the testimony of Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Reena Kapoor.

She testified that Smith retained his lust for human flesh after his arrest - even offering to eat her.

Kapoor claimed that Smith suffered from psychotic incidents since childhood and heard voices that told him to kill people.

She
 said the voices ordered Smith to eat the victim's brain so they would 
get a better understanding of human behavior and the eyes so that they 
could see into the 'spirit realm.'

After Smith ate the body parts he went to Subway, she said.
