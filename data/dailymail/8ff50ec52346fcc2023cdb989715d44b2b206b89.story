Guardian deputy sports editor Barry Glendenning has been forced to apologise after calling the late Sir Jack Hayward 'a big, massive racist'

The deputy sports editor of the Guardian has apologised after branding late philanthropist and ex-football club owner Sir Jack Hayward a 'racist' and comparing him to Hitler.

Barry Glendenning was attacked on social media after using an appearance on podcast Football Weekly to criticise Sir Jack, who passed away on January 13.

Mr Glendenning described the former chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers as 'a big, massive racist' before commenting 'but in a kind of endearing way.'

He went on to say that Sir Jack had once described himself as a 'xenophobe', adding: 'At least he was open about it, but then so was Adolf Hitler and that doesn’t make him a nice guy does it?'

Furious Wolves supporters called on fans to boycott the Guardian in the wake of the remarks, with one user branding them 'out of order' and 'akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper'.

Mr Glendenning was forced into an apology today, saying he was 'very sorry' he had used the word racist, and refuting allegations that he had compared Sir Jack to the Nazi leader.

The controversial comments came less than a week after 91-year-old Sir Jack, who ploughed millions of pounds in Wolverhampton Wanderers FC, died in Florida.

Appearing on a light-hearted sports talk show, Mr Glendenning was speaking about Sir Jack when an email from a listener called Greenmile was read out by presenter James Richardson.

It said: 'I was a bit disappointed that your tribute to Sir Jack Hayward focused almost exclusively on him giving money to Wolves and kind of glossed over him being an appalling old racist bigot.'

In response Glendenning said: 'It’s a fair point, he was a big massive racist, but in a kind of endearing way.

'On his estate in the Bahamas, no-one was allowed to drive a foreign car, only English models. He was quite openly xenophobic and racist, but yet he was also very generous.

'To think someone’s not even cold on the slab, maybe we should’ve touched on it at least. 

Mr Glendenning made the comments during a podcast on Sir Jack. He was attacked by Wolves supporters, who branded him 'scum' and said the remarks were 'akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper'

'As my mam says, "if you don’t have anything nice to say about a dead person, then just don’t say anything". At least he was open about his views, but so was Adolf Hitler and that does not make him a nice guy.'

But the Guardian website was quickly flooded with comments criticising the remarks.

Chris Harper wrote: 'The racism/hitler comments were out of order. Akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper.'

Sir Jack Hayward was known as a big-hearted philanthropist and staunch patriot.

He bought his boyhood football club Wolverhampton Wanderers for £2million in 1990, spent £50million taking them to the premier league, then sold the club for a token £10 in 2007.

He also paid the equivalent of £2million in today's money to have the SS Great Britain brought back to this country after the Falklands War and restored.

He also gave £1million to help rebuild a Falklands hospital, and another £1million to support widows and orphans.

Another project of his was wildlife sanctuary Lundy Island, situated off the North Devon coast, which he bought for £150,000 in 1969 to 'stop it falling into foreign hands.'

Instead of keeping it for himself, he turned it over to the National Trust, saving it for generations to come. 

He was knighted by Margaret Thatcher in 1986, and once hosted the Queen at his home in the Bahamas.

While there, he served Her Majesty her favourite Malvern water, because he didn't want her drinking 'any of that foreign Perrier stuff'. 

He passed away in Florida on January 13. 

Dan Baillie added: 'Disgraceful stuff from you about £SirJack in your podcast. He gave so much to several causes, and all you do is cry "racist"'

Tom Hever tweeted: 'Just listened to a podcast on your website where Sir Jack Hayward was compared to Adolf Hitler. You horrible bunch of scum bags.'

Neil Weav added: 'You should hand in your resignation immediately. Disgusting and disrespectful.'

Earlier today Glendenning apologised for his comments, saying he 'used the wrong words'.

He said: “I’m very sorry I said racist. He was by all accounts a very nice man. He had some old fashioned views. He was happy to declare himself a xenophobe.

“Sir Jack was a great and generous man and a brilliant owner. I’m annoyed some Wolves fans now think that’s not my view.

'I certainly wasn’t comparing him to Hitler. I do not think in any way Sir Jack was like Hitler.'

He later posted another apology on twitter, saying: 'I have no problem with him - he was a good and generous man. Just a bit old school in some of his views.

'It was misplaced yes, he had rather eccentric views but was by all accounts a top bloke. Will clarify on Thursday’s podcast.'

Former World War II pilot Sir Jack, who became a millionaire after expanding his father’s agriculture business, bought his boyhood club in 1990.

He went on to spend £70million of his personal fortune renovating their dilapidated Molineux stadium and propelling the club into the Premier League.

He sold the club in 2007 for just £10 and retired to his home in the Bahamas before dying on January 13 following a long battle with ill health.
