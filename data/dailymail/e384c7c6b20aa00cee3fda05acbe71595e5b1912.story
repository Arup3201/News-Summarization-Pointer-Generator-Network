Mystery: Sara Al Amoudi has won her battle after being sued for £14million by two London property developers

A mysterious ‘vamp in a veil’ who allegedly duped a couple out of flats worth £14million has been told she can keep the properties.

The identity of the woman is still unclear and even the judge that ruled in her favour remains in the dark.

Named as Sara Al-Amoudi in court, she was accused of being a penniless Ethiopian prostitute posing as an Arabian princess with limitless wealth.

It was even suggested to the court that the woman, said to be between 30 and 43, was the secret fifth wife of 89-year-old King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, one of the richest men on earth.

London property developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton claimed they temporarily signed six flats in Knightsbridge over to Miss Al-Amoudi, but that no payment was forthcoming. In court they demanded the value of the apartments back.

Their barrister Stuart Cakebread had described Miss Al-Amoudi’s case as ‘a farrago of lies’ and ‘the most preposterous nonsense’ and ridiculed her ‘absurd performance where she pretends to be a Saudi princess’.

But a judge at London’s High Court has ruled that the couple were not tricked – and that mother-of-one Miss Al-Amoudi is the flats’ rightful owner.

Mrs Justice Asplin accepted Miss Al-Amoudi’s claim that she was having a secret affair with Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his long-term girlfriend, 56-year-old Miss Clutterbuck, and that the flats were repayment for millions she lent him.

While Miss Al-Amoudi denied presenting herself as a princess as part of the scam, the judge noted that she has bodyguards and ‘travels in a black Range Rover, part of the registration number of which is “HRH”’.

‘Her evidence in relation to the registration number was that it was coincidence and then sought to deny knowledge of it,’ the judge said. ‘I found her evidence in this regard to be highly implausible and I reject it.’

But she added that it was ‘unnecessary to determine’ whether or not Miss Al-Amoudi was an imposter.

Ms Al Amoudi maintained throughout a month-long High Court hearing that she was the runaway daughter of a billionaire Saudi sheik

In court the mysterious woman made much play of her adherence to the 
rules of Islam – even having to be persuaded to remove her veil.

But the Daily Mail uncovered photographs of her in a London nightclub wearing a silky bodice and displaying her cleavage.

A
 previous criminal trial also heard claims that her un-Islamic 
activities included swilling champagne and snorting cocaine and the 
horse tranquilliser ketamine.

The dispute over flats began during 
the property boom at the start of the Millennium, when Mr Clutterbuck 
and Mr Paton sought properties in Knightsbridge close to Harrods to 
develop.

They said Miss Al-Amoudi was introduced as a Saudi princess 
whose family had ‘limitless wealth’, and they worked with her for years 
towards a huge development.

When they needed investment, they 
said, she claimed to have access to £46million through an Islamic 
‘sharia loan’, but needed the six flats as securities to get the cash.

She
 then kept the apartments, they alleged, but no loan or development ever
 materialised. Miss Al-Amoudi argued that she was ‘naïve and vulnerable’
 and had a long affair with Mr Paton, but that it fell apart when his 
debts to her reached £5million and she discovered he was a drug user.

She claimed she never entered into business schemes with the two developers and vehemently denied being a prostitute.

Despite
 finding for Miss Al-Amoudi, the judge said of her: ‘The majority of her
 evidence was given in a highly emotional manner which verged on the 
hysterical and barely made any sense. In cross-examination she was 
reluctant to confirm whether she had been married to a member of the 
Saudi royal family.’

Mrs Justice Asplin dismissed claims from 
witness Negat Ali, an Ethiopian living in south London, that she knew 
Miss Al-Amoudi as a prostitute in Dubai 25 years ago. Her evidence was 
not accepted among claims she was paid to lie.

The judge also 
appeared to accept Miss Al-Amoudi’s assertion that her extravagant 
lifestyle in London had been funded through suitcases of cash flown into
 London by relatives, £1million at a time. She told the court she spent 
£1million on perfume in two months.

Last night Miss Al-Amoudi, who
 lives in London, said in a statement: ‘I am very pleased the judge has 
found there never have been business dealings between me and the 
claimants and that they have no interest whatsoever in any of my 
properties.

‘The claimants have tried to put pressure on me and 
those supporting me by making very nasty personal allegations, even 
though they are untrue and unsupported by evidence.’

Miss 
Clutterbuck and Mr Paton said they planned to appeal, maintaining that 
unveiling Miss Al-Amoudi’s true identity was crucial to the case.
