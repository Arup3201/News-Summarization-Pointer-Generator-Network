Five adults have been arrested on horrific cruelty charges after allegedly performing a sex act on a toddler, forcing five young children to watch them have sex and shooting them with BB guns.

William Wade, 23, Danielle Hammond, 22, Shakia Jackson, 31, Daryl Carter, 24, and 22-year-old Mark Isom reportedly  abused the youngsters at a house in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

They punched and slapped the children - aged one to 10 - threw them over a stair banister and forced them to witness them having sex as they watched movies, it is said.

'Two of the adult [had] sexual acts in front of the children in front of a TV. They would perform sex on each other, right in front of the children,' the county's district attorney, Jack Whelan, said.

The adults also allegedly shot the youngsters  with three BB guns  as a form of 'discipline' - sometimes hitting them in the head. One boy told detectives it 'really hurt', ABC 6 reported.

And most disturbingly, on one occasion, the three men even held down one of the women - which of the two remains unclear - and forced her to perform a sex act on a two-year-old boy, it is alleged.

'While he was in the process of having his diaper being changed, they grabbed the child, the child is naked, and they forced the child on top of the female,' Mr Whelan told CBS Philadelphia.

'[They[ forced his private part into the face of the female.'

He added: 'It's almost unbelievable, I mean you can't even imagine the horror that these children had to live under. What the [adults'] acts have caused these children to endure is outrageous.'

Now, the group has been arrested on a number of charges following the months of alleged physical and sexual abuse at the house on 7th Street near Cedar Avenue in Darby, according to KTLA 5.

These include endangering the welfare of children, the corruption of minors, simple assault, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. 

Although Wade, Jackson, Carter and Isom remained in custody at Delaware County Prison on Monday, Hammond was released on bail on Friday night.

When Action News asked her father about the charges filed against her, he angrily replied: 'How can I know? I'm not a magician.' 

According to court documents, Jackson admitted in a police interview to shooting the children with BB guns, but claimed: 'She and the others were only playing and the children wanted to be shot.'

Jackson and Carter are listed as residents of the home, while the other three suspects gave police addresses in Philadelphia. The children are now reportedly in the care of a relative.
