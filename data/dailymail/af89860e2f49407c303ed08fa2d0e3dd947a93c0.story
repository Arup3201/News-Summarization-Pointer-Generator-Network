Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp picked Diego Costa as one of his 10 players to watch at the beginning of the season, writing: 'Watch him wrestling with defenders, pulling and scratching and diving to win penalties. Jose will love him, defenders will hate him! He is a finisher - and I fancy him to settle quickly and score plenty.'

After watching Diego Costa closely at Atletico Madrid last season, I picked him as one of my 10 to watch this time around. So far, so good.

The Spaniard is an absolute animal and has made a sensational start to his Chelsea career. He charges around like the Tasmanian devil and the Everton defence looked petrified of him at Goodison Park.

Every game he looks like scoring. That’s because he is so hungry and you don’t always see that same drive in every striker. 

Jose Mourinho accused some of the Everton players of picking on Costa, but he doesn’t look like the kind of person you can bully! He can be wound up but his spat with Seamus Coleman didn’t bother me in the slightest. He’s a winner and can be a revelation in this league.

How's he missed that? Mario Balotelli might've had a hat-trick on his Liverpool debut away at Tottenham

In and out debut: Angel di Maria wasn't able to make a significant impact on the game at Burnley

The best thing that happened to Liverpool on Sunday was Mario Balotelli not scoring. If he had, the game and the headlines would all be about him. Instead it was another team display that showed the gulf in class between Spurs and Liverpool. Balotelli bought into the work ethic and Brendan Rodgers will hope he keeps it up.

As for his team-mate, Raheem Sterling is now England’s best player. He is lightning fast, beats defenders for fun and has all the ability to become our talisman.

What a start to the season for Nathan Dyer and Swansea. The winger has three goals in three games and Swansea are joint top of the league with nine out of nine points.

Garry Monk is doing a fine job, bringing in good players like Bafetimbi Gomis but also clearing out others like Chico Flores, who I always felt was a bit of a David Luiz defender — something of a liability.

A lot of people tipped Swansea to go down this season. On this form? Not a chance.

All smiles: Morgan Schneiderlin is mobbed by his Southampton team-mates as they beat West Ham

After getting sacked by Man City in 2009, Saturday’s win will have felt very good for Stoke boss Mark Hughes.

He and his players will have watched City tear apart Liverpool last week and probably thought to themselves: ‘My god, this could be a nightmare for us.’ A lot of teams will go to the Etihad with damage limitation in mind, but not Stoke.

They arrived with a game plan and were well organised. City only lost once at home last season — to Chelsea in February — so full credit to Stoke.

You will have to go a long way to find a better result in the league this season.

No matter how much he cost, Angel di Maria was never going to arrive at Old Trafford, wave a magic wand and turn them into the United of old.

He showed glimpses of quality at Burnley but the team are playing with fear, probably for the first time in their lives. Louis van Gaal will hate not being able to work with several players over the international break, because there is a lot to be done.

But after planes over the stadium and being made a scapegoat last season, David Moyes must be relieved to know it was not just down to him.

Too much too soon? Youngster Yaya Sanogo struggles when he leads the line for Arsenal 

Only a few days ago Arsene Wenger said Yaya Sanogo could be the man to lead the line for Arsenal in their title challenge this season. No goals in 16 games shows he is not the answer.

Arsenal have a team of playmakers but imagine if they had a world-class striker to finish off those chances? Even with Olivier Giroud fit they lack firepower. Wenger now says he will be active in the transfer market to solve the problem, but to leave it this late is ridiculous.

After his year at Man United did not go to plan, Wilfried Zaha has, to an extent, come home to Palace.

The key for him is having a boss who believes in him. The fans already love him at Palace and will even more after his late equaliser at Newcastle. He has talent and this is a good chance for him to remind us all what he’s capable of.

Five years ago Charlie Austin was playing for Poole Town. Now he’s scoring goals in the Premier League.

As a player you always have some doubts and missing that penalty on the opening day won’t have helped, but there’s no doubt he can cut it. I saw him the evening after the game and congratulated him, but when I asked my dad if I should buy him a bottle of champagne, it was a definite no! That’s the dedication needed at the top level these days.

Storming run: Mame Biram Diouf travelled 70 yards to score Stoke's winner against Manchester City

Tottenham v Liverpool is now the joint highest scoring Premier League fixture in history, with Liverpool v Newcastle. Both fixtures have had a total of 129 goals.

I had an element of sympathy for Morgan Schneiderlin this summer. He wanted out but had to watch as his friends were all sold off around him. But results like Saturday’s will make it much easier for him to stay a little while longer at Southampton.

Players have been known to go on strike to force a move but it looks like the Frenchman is happy to knuckle down. He is a box-to-box midfielder who can do it all and, with Ronald Koeman giving him licence to play further forward, he’s adding goals to his game, too.

But if he does keep his shooting boots on, he needs to remember to celebrate a bit more. His body language was slightly odd at West Ham — goals don’t come along that often from midfield so you have to enjoy them!

Where's this come from? Swansea's Nathan Dyer already has three Premier League goals this season
