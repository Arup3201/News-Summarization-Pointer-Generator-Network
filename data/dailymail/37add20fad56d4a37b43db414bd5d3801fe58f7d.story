His home is a graveyard, his job, shoplifting and his skin, cracked and pitted with psoriasis - the result of sleeping rough and a raging addiction to heroin and crack.

Shanki, a 30-something from India's Punjab region, is just one of the estimated 600,000 illegal immigrants currently thought to live in Britain.

But as new Fergal Keane documentary, The Hidden World of Britain's Immigrants, reveals, the British dream all too often proves a nightmare.

Along with Shanki, others to appear in the film, which focuses on the London borough of Ilford, include Harish, another Punjabi rough sleeper who has resorted to industrial quantities of alcohol to get through the day, and Lucky, a persistent thief.

Yet despite their appalling living conditions and inability to get a job, the men say they would prefer stay in the UK rather than lose face by returning home to their families empty handed.

'I am crazy for drugs. I do not look after myself or my body,' Shanki reveals. 'But I don't have the willpower [to stop].

He adds: 'I
 am ashamed to go home and you know why? I have been here nine years and I
 have f***ing zero.

'I don't want to go to India like this, never, ever. 
Really, I need to stop the drugs. I'm finished man, I'm finished. 
Finished, finished, finished.'

Problem: A quarter of London's homeless are from Eastern Europe, including the Romanians of Marble Arch

But it isn't just migrants from India and Pakistan who arrive to discover that the UK is a far less welcoming place than they anticipated.

Eastern Europeans now make up a quarter of London's rough sleepers, and Lithuanian Oksana is one of them.

She came to the UK with the help of a fixer who had promised her a job but he soon disappeared, leaving her to struggle alone.

As an EU citizen, Oksana is entitled to benefits but is filmed sleeping rough while she and her husband wait for the payments to begin.

'I was thinking England might be easier, you [can] find work easier,' she explains, but as a former heroin addict with a conviction for shoplifting, getting a job has proved difficult.

She adds: 'Of course we are sad about the situation.'

Difficult: Many who overstay are not picked up because the Border Agency doesn't monitor exit records

When Keane returns three months later, the pair are still unemployed but have moved into a house paid for by their benefits.

'Every week we get £72 [each]. So £100 for Steve [their landlord] and £44 for us. In Lithuania we don't have anything like this.'

Although the pair say they are searching for work, Oksana admits she turned down a cleaning job in a hotel because of an old injury picked up while addicted to drugs.

By contrast, Shanki and his friends are desperate for work but find it even more of a struggle thanks to their lack of work visas.

'Nowadays everybody is scared,' explains Shanki. 'If they 
find [an] illegal immigrant in any job, [the employer is given a] £10,000 fine. That's why they don't 
give job to anyone without passport or visa.'

For some, the answer is to throw in the towel and go home. Among those to choose voluntary repatriation is Setal, a former Indian Army soldier.

'I have never stolen anything, I have 
never gone to jail,' he tells Keane. 'I do not have any such record - I have a clean 
record here.

Complaints: Shopkeepers in Ilford have complained about the antisocial behaviour of Shanki and his friends

'There is a rule in the [Indian] army that if you come home in nine 
years, your pension continues. That's why I want to get home.'

Parminder Singh, an elder and magistrate at Ilford's Sikh temple, which provides food for unlucky migrants such as Setal, thinks he's making the right decision.

A third generation Briton, Mr Singh is proud of his father and grandfather's contribution to the UK, including stints fighting for the Allies in the World Wars, but says he feels threatened by the antisocial behaviour of Shanki and his friends.

'This
 is my country. I need a visa to go somewhere else but I don't need a 
visa to be here,' he explains.

'I'm not saying they're bad people. 
It's the system that has allowed them to be trafficked and brought over 
here.

Moving on: Keane with Setal who has now returned home to India after volunteering for repatriation

'I feel they have a lot of contributions to make to
 their own countries and they should get back there and do it.'

For Setal, a plane ticket home really is the end of the nightmare but for others, Shanki among them, things just get worse.

Several months after Keane first meets him, he's been sent to prison after being caught red-handed stealing £1,500 of clothes from a local Marks & Spencer.

It's his fourth prison term and the Home Office have asked to see his files - the start of the deportation process.

Despite his hopes of a better life, it seems that for Shanki, his British nightmare could be coming to an end.
