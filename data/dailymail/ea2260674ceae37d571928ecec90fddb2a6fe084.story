At first glance, it is all the fun of the circus as performing monkeys dressed as children ride on a scooter, jump through a hoop and stand on their hands in front of a cheering crowd.

But the gaiety of the show on a brightly-lit stage in South Korea belies the barbaric treatment the animals have endured behind the scenes to ensure their tricks are faultless.

Their 'training' has been cruelty in the extreme - seeing the monkeys chained in tiny cages, dragged around on leashes and yanked up in ‘hanging style’ by their necks, with their arms forced above their heads and behind their backs.

A secret video shot at ‘Monkey School’ in South Korea by British-based Animal Defenders International (ADI) reveals a horrifying attitude to animals - a callousness that the organisation sadly admits is universal to the performing animals industry.

‘It is hard to imagine a worse life for these poor animals,’ said Fleur Dawes, spokesman for ADI.

‘The only time these intelligent and sensitive animals were let out of their cages was to be abused during training or to perform tricks in front of the crowd.’ 

The footage shows monkeys living in squalid conditions in cramped cages, pushing their hands out as if begging for release - and one even attempts to work the padlock free on its cage. 

Shocking: Footage shows a monkey being dragged away by its neck - with its hands tied tightly behind its back

Barbaric: The animal falls over during the harsh treatment, before it is dragged upward again by the trainer

Dangerous: The treatment appears to come dangerously close to the animals being choked to death or having their spinal cords severed. ‘It is hard to imagine a worse life for these poor animals,’ said an ADI spokesman

A trainer can be seen hauling a monkey, with a leash around its neck, up on its hind legs and forcing its arms above its head.

Its hands are then tied behind its back and, as it begins to run away in sheer terror, it falls heavily on its face - its screeches and screams mingled with the laughter of the trainers.

Once caught, it is hauled up with its feet above the ground and dragged away by its neck, treatment that appeared to come dangerously close to the animal being choked to death or having its spinal cord severed.

Caged: The footage shows monkeys living in cramped cages, pushing their hands out as if begging for release

Attempting to flee: One primate even attempts to undo the padlock on its cage in a bid for freedom (pictured)

Desperate: The monkeys lie alone in tiny cages or in other enclosures that are dirty and heavily overcrowded

Dead: One monkey is pictured lying dead in its cage, blood pooling around its head, froth foaming at its mouth

And one monkey was pictured lying 
dead in its cage, blood pooling around its head, froth foaming at its 
mouth. How it died is not known.

They lie, these sad primates, alone in tiny cages or in other enclosures that are heavily overcrowded.

One animal is seen sadly sucking its thumb as it peers out through the wire of its cage.

None
 are allowed happiness in Monkey School - not even a mother and her baby
 - as they all await the next beating to ensure they learn their roles 
for the crowds who will pay later to watch their stage performance.

Hiding in fear: ADI says world-wide protests and pleas to the people of South Korea to boycott cruel monkey shows could help shut down such heartless 'training' schools. Above, a scared monkey hides from its trainers

Recaptured: The people behind the performances, says ADI CEO Jan Cramer, 'show no understanding or sympathy for the terror they produce'. Above, the animal is dragged out from its hiding place by trainers

Escape: The monkeys are only 'freed' when they are brought from their cages, dressed as children and led to the show in which they are the cowed stars. Above, the monkey frantically runs away from its trainers

They push their hands out through the wire as if begging for freedom but a tragic representation of that will only come when they are brought from their cages, dressed in children’s clothes and led to the show in which they are the cowed stars.

They sit upright on stools, like children in kindergarten, before standing unnaturally, bolt upright on their hind legs.

One rides around on a three-wheeled bike, another leaps through a hoop and then as a grand finale, they stand on their hands as their stick-wielding trainer keeps them in line.

Unnatural: The monkeys (pictured sitting on yellow seats) are under the command of a stick-wielding trainer

Animal Defenders International says world-wide protests and pleas to the people of South Korea to boycott cruel monkey shows could go a long way to closing down such heartless events.

The people behind the performances, says ADI chief executive Jan Creamer, ‘show no understanding or sympathy for the terror they produce. They laugh as these tragic animals cry.

‘We believe that when the people of Korea are made aware of what is going on they will be as disgusted by this cruelty as much as we are.’
