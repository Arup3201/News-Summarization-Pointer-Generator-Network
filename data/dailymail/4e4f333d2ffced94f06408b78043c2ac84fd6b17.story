Thank goodness it’s Friday? Not if your name is Rory McIlroy. It all went wrong for the Northern Irishman at the Masters in the second round and here was another Friday horror show over the front nine at the Players Championship.

After 12 holes on Thursday the 25-year-old was five under par and lying joint second. After seven holes of his second round he was four over and tied 119th.

You’d write it off as one of those things except it happens all too often with McIlroy when the shoulders slump and one calamity is duly followed by another. It’s certainly something he needs to start addressing.  

Rough: It all went wrong for Rory McIlroy during the second round at Sawgrass

At least the real McIlroy showed up 
over the back nine. He gave himself a good talking-to during the long 
walk from the ninth green to the 10th tee. Three birdies meant he came 
to the 18th needing one more to make the halfway cut on the limit. 
Typical Rory. When he really needs to make a putt he does so, and he did
 so again here, with a 20-footer.

But
 it still means he will start on Saturday morning 12 shots off the lead 
held by German Martin Kaymer, who added a 69 to his stunning opening 
score of 63.

’I don’t know 
what’s happening on Fridays,’ said McIlroy. ‘It’s like I don’t want to 
play on that day. But I’m proud of the way I battled back. It’s not 
where I want to be but at least I am around for the weekend.’

A
 good analogy would be with the football team who are 4-0 down at 
half-time and ‘win’ the second half 2-0. McIlroy knows better than 
anyone you simply can’t play zombie golf for five holes at this level 
and hope to win trophies.

When
 Kaymer finished his work at lunchtime it appeared for all the world he 
would lead by a street. Step forward young American Jordan Spieth, who 
hunted him down so artfully in the more difficult afternoon conditions 
he will start the third round just one shot adrift. Spieth, who went so 
close to winning the Masters on his debut, is also playing in this 
tournament for the first time and is the only player in the field who 
has not had a bogey. The 20-year-old is an amazing talent, isn’t he?

Lee
 Westwood shot 71 that was the least he deserved for some quality play 
and will start the weekend six behind in tied fourth place, as will US 
Open Champion Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia, who also broke par by a 
stroke. Graeme McDowell is one shot further back.

Kaymer
 has fallen to 61st in the world and hasn’t won a full field event since
 holing the winning putt at the 2012 Ryder Cup at Medinah. Here he has 
returned to form in spectacular style, with 14 birdies in 36 holes. A 
true measure of his performance is the next best total from his half of 
the draw was posted by American veteran Jim Furyk, who is six behind, 
with US-based Londoner Brian Davis a further shot adrift.

It’s
 not as if Kaymer’s half was full of journeymen either. All four of the 
players in with the chance to become world No 1 were in action alongside
 Kaymer and all four looked pedestrian by comparison. Best placed is 
Henrik Stenson, who needs to finish in the top six and is presently tied
 24th.

Australian Adam Scott
 did at least show the pride of a world No 1 hopeful to bounce back from
 his calamitous opening round of 77 with a score of 67 that left him on 
the same mark as McIlroy. He then revealed his status as one of the 
sporting world’s most eligible bachelors was at an end, since he got 
married in secret in the week after the Masters.

England’s
 Luke Donald shot 69 and Welshman Jamie Donaldson a 67 to stand on three
 under, while the most high profile player to miss the halfway cut was 
Open Champion Phil Mickelson, who missed out by one.
