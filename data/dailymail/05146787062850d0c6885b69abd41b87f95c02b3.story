Two days after wearing the yellow jersey, France's Tony Gallopin claimed the 11th stage of the Tour de France thanks to late attacks in a nervous finale on Wednesday.

German John Degenkolb was second and Italian Matteo Trentin took third place at the end of a 187.5km ride from Besancon.

Italian Vincenzo Nibali retained the overall leader's yellow jersey after staying safe by the front of the bunch in the final descent.

Gallopin,
 who gave France its second stage win this year after Blel Kadri 
prevailed last week, powered away in the last climb and after being 
rejoined by Michal Kwiatkowski, Peter Sagan and Michael Rogers, he 
counter-attacked 2.5km from the line.

The
 Lotto-Belisol rider looked back several times but held off the peloton 
to cross the line with the bunch breathing down his neck.

'It's
 incredible, I want to thank my family because my father had told me 
that we should check up this stage, and it clearly helped,' said 
Gallopin, who wore the yellow jersey during Monday's 10th stage.

'I would not have imagined that but I had marked that stage after coming close in Sheffield and Nancy.'

Nibali's
 Astana team suffered a minor wobble when the Italian's lieutenant, 
Michele Scarponi, fell off his bike in a climb, but he finished the 
stage.

Ireland's Nicolas 
Roche was voted the most aggressive rider in the stage after trying his 
luck several times in the finale as the Tinkoff-Saxo team turned its 
focus to stage wins following Alberto Contador's exit from the race.

Roche
 was reined in when Sagan, who has yet to win a stage this year despite 
coming very close several times, led the peloton at breakneck speed in 
the descent towards Oyonnax.
