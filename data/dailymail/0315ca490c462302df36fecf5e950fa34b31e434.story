Get the sunglasses on and start marinating the meat because it is due to be a barbecue bank holiday weekend â€“ as long as you live in the West, that is.

Those on the other side of the country might be advised to run for cover and put the oven on instead. Forecasters are predicting an east-west split for much of the weekend.

While those in London, the South-East and East Anglia are due to be battered by rain over Saturday and Sunday, causing flooding, the sun is expected to shine across Devon and Cornwall, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Wales, Cumbria and even western Scotland.
