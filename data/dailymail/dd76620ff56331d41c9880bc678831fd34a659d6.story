More than 100,000 Romanians have applied for the right to work in Britain since the autumn of 2013.

The count of Romanians who asked for National Insurance numbers – necessary for anyone who wants to work legally in Britain – has risen nearly fivefold in a year.

The explosion in numbers of Romanians came alongside a sharp rise in applications from Bulgarians for National Insurance documents.

There were 31,500 Bulgarians who applied for and received their numbers in the year up to September – more than double the total in the previous 12 months.

Yesterday’s official figures point to a large-scale movement into Britain of citizens of the two Eastern European countries which joined the EU in 2007 and whose citizens were given the right to work freely in Britain from January.

They tally with predictions from the Migration Watch think tank which projected that the economic draw of jobs and benefits in Britain would bring in 50,000 people a year from two of the poorest countries in the EU.

They suggest that some analysts, including those from the BBC, who declared earlier this year that there had been no new influx from the two countries, were badly off target.

National Insurance applications, counted by the Department for Work and Pensions, show the number of people who applied for the documents they need to work rather than numbers newly arriving in the country.

They appear to include a large number of people who were already in Britain before Romanians and Bulgarians were given the right to work in January.

Sarah Crofts, of the Office for National Statistics, said that half of those applying for National Insurance numbers were ‘people who had been in the UK for a year or longer’.

The ONS analysis raises the possibility that many of the Romanians and Bulgarians may have been working illegally in Britain in the black economy.

ONS immigration figures said immigrants in the year to June 2012 included 32,000 people from Romania and Bulgaria. Of these arrivals, 24,000 are estimated to have come to Britain to work.

The 103,900 National Insurance numbers issued to Romanian citizens in the year to September represented a 468 per cent rise on the 18,300 applications recorded in the previous 12 months.

The 31,500 National Insurance numbers issued to Bulgarians was a rise of 205 per cent on the 10,300 in the previous 12 months.

In the run-up to the European elections in May, the BBC claimed that there were 4,000 fewer Romanian and Bulgarian workers in Britain in March than in January.

Its political editor scoffed: ‘So much for those predictions of a flood of immigrants coming from Romania and Bulgaria once the door to the UK was opened.’

However the BBC and other analysts who came to the same conclusion were using figures from the Labour Force Survey, an ONS research survey that has too small a sample to provide an accurate count of small groups within the population.

National Insurance number applications, on the other hand, provide a fully accurate count of actual people who want to work legally in this country.
