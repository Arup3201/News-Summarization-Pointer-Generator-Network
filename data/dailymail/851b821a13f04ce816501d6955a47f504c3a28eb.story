Penn State is paying $59.7 million to 26 young men who endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, they announced today.

The university said it had concluded negotiations that have lasted about a year.

The school said 23 deals are fully signed and three are agreements in principle. The school faces six other claims, and the university says it believes some do not have merit while others may produce settlements.

Penn State said the day Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 of 45 criminal counts that it was determined to compensate his victims.

The settlements have been unfolding since mid-August, when attorneys for the accusers began to disclose them.

Penn State followed a policy in which it has not been confirming them, waiting instead to announce deals at once.

Penn State has spent more than $50 million on other costs related to the Sandusky scandal, including lawyers' fees, public relations expenses, and adoption of new policies and procedures related to children and sexual abuse complaints.

Sandusky, 69, has been pursuing appeals while he serves a 30-to-60-year prison sentence.

Three former Penn State administrators await trial in Harrisburg on charges they engaged in a criminal cover-up of the Sandusky scandal.

Former president Graham Spanier, retired vice president Gary Schultz and retired athletic director Tim Curley deny the allegations, and a trial date has not been scheduled.

Eight young men testified against Sandusky, describing a range of abuse they said went from grooming and manipulation to fondling, oral sex and anal rape when they were boys.

Sandusky did not testify at his trial but has long asserted his innocence. He has acknowledged he showered with boys but insisted he never molested them.

The abuse scandal rocked Penn State, bringing down football coach Joe Paterno and leading college sports' governing body, the NCAA, to levy unprecedented sanctions against the university's football program.

Victims who had not come forward with their 
allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 have been granted 
settlements by the Pennsylvania university

Among those who reached settlements were some who testified at Sandusky's trial last year.

Harrisburg attorney Chuck Schmidt confirmed his client has settled, as did Williamsport attorney Clifford Rieders.

'He is a very responsible, 
thoughtful, intelligent man,' Rieders said of his client. 
'His reaction is that this was a terrible tragedy and he'd like to move 
on with his life and get the help he needs for a meaningful life.'

Rieders said his client was paid Sept. 30. Schmidt said his received a check about two weeks ago.

Philadelphia attorney Tom Kline 
previously announced his client had settled, as did the Philadelphia 
firm Ross Feller, which represents seven.

Three former Penn State 
administrators are awaiting trial in Harrisburg for what prosecutors say
was a criminal cover-up of complaints about Sandusky.

Former president Graham Spanier, 
former vice president Gary Schultz and former athletic director Tim 
Curley have all denied the allegations.

Last month, the convicted pedophile was denied a new trial.

The unanimous decision by a 
three-judge Superior Court panel on Wednesday came barely two weeks 
after they heard oral arguments by Sandusky's lawyer and a state 
prosecutor.

Defense lawyer Norris Gelman said he planned to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case.

Sandusky had argued his trial lawyers 
did not have sufficient time to prepare, a prosecutor made improper 
references to him not testifying on his own behalf and the judge 
mishandled two jury instructions.

The opinion by Judge Jack Panella 
said trial judges have discretion about whether to allow pretrial 
delays, and that in Sandusky's case the judge carefully considered the 
continuance requests.

'The 
decision does not reflect a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in 
the face of Sandusky's request; it was not an arbitrary denial,' Panella
wrote.

Sandusky had wanted
the trial judge, John Cleland, to give jurors an instruction about the 
amount of time it took for nearly all of the victims to report their 
allegations.

A sad ending: Legendary Penn State football 
coach Joe Paterno was fired before the end of the 2011 season amid the 
scandal and died only months later

Panella 
wrote that Cleland should have evaluated the need for such a jury 
instruction based on each victim's age and maturity, but Cleland's 
failure to do so did not harm Sandusky.

'The trial court specifically instructed
the jury that they were to consider any possible motives of the victims
in coming forward,' Panella wrote.

'The vigorous cross-examination of 
the victims and arguments by defense counsel, when combined with the 
trial court's instructions on credibility, clearly defined the issues 
for the jury.'

The issue related to Sandusky not testifying was not properly preserved for appeals court review, Panella wrote.

The appeals court also turned down 
another jury instruction claim, related to weighing a defendant's good 
character against the allegations.

Messages left for a spokesman for the attorney general's office were not immediately returned.
