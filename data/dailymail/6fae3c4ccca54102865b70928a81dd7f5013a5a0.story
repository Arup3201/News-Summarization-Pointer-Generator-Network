Accused: Daniel St. Hubert allegedly stabbed 2 children and could be charged in further attacks

A convict accused of stabbing a six-year-old boy to death and leaving his seven-year-old friend fighting for her life was stopped by police for public urination earlier this week - but then let go.

Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was caught urinating on Wednesday just blocks from the Boulevard Houses in East New York, where he allegedly murdered P.J. Avitto and attacked Mikayla Capers in an elevator.

He claimed that he didn't know it was illegal and, after showing proper ID, he was released with a summons, the New York Daily News reported.

But just hours later he was arrested for the stabbings after police patrolled the area around his mother's home in Queens - and now he is being eyed in yet another grisly crime, police said.

St. Hubert appears on surveillance video near the subway stop where a homeless man was stabbed on a platform early on Wednesday morning, said police spokesman Stephen Davis.

Witnesses to the seemingly random attack also described the suspect using an 8-to-10-inch knife with a brown handle similar to one recovered on St. Hubert when he was arrested, Davis said.

The 52-year-old homeless man is recovering in a hospital and is likely to survive his injuries.

Victims: Six-year-old P.J. Avitto, left, was stabbed to death in an elevator in his housing block on Sunday, while seven-year-old Mikayla Capers was left in critical condition. St. Hubert has been arrested in the attack

Killed: 18-year-old Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was stabbed on Friday four blocks from where the children were attacked but police are still investigating whether St Hubert could be responsible

St. Hubert is also suspected of stabbing to death 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland on Friday four blocks from where the attack of the young children happened, police said.

Yet more forensic testing at that scene needs to be conducted, Davis said. A similar knife was recovered at the scene of Copeland's slaying.

Investigators are now reviewing all city stabbings that occurred since St. Hubert was released from prison on May 23, after he finished a five-year sentence for attempted murder and assault.

St. Hubert was being held in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn precinct on Thursday and unavailable for comment. It wasn't immediately clear if he had made any statements or had asked for an attorney.

Plea: Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce appealed for help tracking down the stabbing suspect hours before he was arrested on Wednesday

Meanwhile, the father of Prince Joshua Avitto, the six-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed, said on Thursday that if he saw the suspect, he'd ask him, 'What made you do this to a little baby?'

'I'm at a loss for words,' Prince's father, Nicholas Avitto, told Fox 5 News. 'The bottom line is he got out and this tragedy took place after he was released from jail.'

St. Hubert was picked up just after 8pm on Wednesday by detectives who had been tracking him, police said. He was identified by forensic evidence recovered on the knife at the scene of Sunday's elevator stabbing, police said.

At a Wednesday evening press conference attended by the mayor, officials said investigators believed St. Hubert had no car and may have been riding the subways.

Davis said St. Hubert, who has an extensive criminal history, had previously been arrested on disorderly conduct charges for taking up two seats on the subway and other infractions.

St. Hubert hasn't yet been officially charged but murder and assault charges are likely coming, said Davis.

St. Hubert didn't put up any resistance during his arrest, though he has a record of assaulting both a police and correction officer, and was angrily ranting to himself in a holding cell late on Wednesday night, Davis said.

It wasn't immediately clear what he was ranting about or if he has a history of mental illness, Davis said.
