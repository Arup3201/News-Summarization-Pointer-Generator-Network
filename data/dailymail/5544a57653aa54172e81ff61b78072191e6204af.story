Hannah Barnes asked hospital staff to call her an ambulance when she was suffering a heart attack - but they told her to call her own

A grandmother who had a heart attack outside a hospital walk-in centre was forced to call her own ambulance - because staff were not allowed to, it has been claimed.

Hannah Barnes, 58, from Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, went to the town's Palmer Community Hospital to get help after she began to feel unwell and matched the symptoms to a previous heart attack.

But despite begging receptionists to call someone she was refused help and instead told to ring the emergency services herself.

The grandmother-of-three was then forced to frantically search her bag for her mobile phone before calling ambulance crews for help.

She was admitted to hospital where she has stayed for the past week in a critical condition after suffering her second heart attack in just six months.

Yesterday Ms Barnes' furious family hit out at the medical centre, claiming she could have died if she had not had her phone with her.

Tina Barnes, her sister, said: 'The whole family is devastated. I could have lost my sister. Would making a free phone call really have harmed them?

'A medical centre is meant to be the place you can turn to. But she had to get help on her own. She is full of life and would do anything for anyone. She didn't deserve this.

'She also suffered a serious heart attack in January. She was outside the walk-in centre and went to get help. She asked a receptionist if they could ring an ambulance as she was having a heart attack.

'But she said she couldn't do that and she would have to ring herself. She doesn't always have her mobile phone with her. If she hadn't had it, she would have died.'

Hannah had been visiting her sister for coffee at around 8.30am when she began to feel hot.

She decided to head to the bank before going home when all of a sudden she felt a problem 'building up and up'.

Ms Barnes immediately recognised the symptoms as the same as those she experienced in January and rushed to Jarrow's Palmer Community Hospital for help.

Tina Barnes, her sister, said: 'The whole family is devastated. I could have lost my sister. Would making a free phone call really have harmed them?' The walk-in centre is run by Northern Doctors Urgent Care Ltd and based at Palmer Community Hospital

When ambulance crews finally arrived she was taken to the Freeman Hospital, in Newcastle, where she remains.

Tina added: 'She says she will never forget the face of the woman who said she couldn't call her an ambulance. I want those responsible to be named and shamed.

'Her grandchildren are all devastated as well.'

A spokesman for Northern Doctors Urgent Care Ltd, which runs the walk-in centre, said: 'Our organisational procedures dictate that when any patient presents to the reception, the receptionist will undertake a brief visual assessment of the patient's presenting condition.

'They will refer to our organisational urgency criteria which clearly identifies the symptoms associated with patients presenting with emergency, urgent or non-urgent conditions, and the actions to be taken accordingly.

'Therefore, when a patient presents to a receptionist requesting an ambulance, the receptionist will briefly identify the physical presenting condition of the patient and seek immediate clinical advice from one of our GPs; while, if necessary, calling 999.'

Christine Briggs, director of operations at NHS South Tyneside Clinical Commissioning Group, said: 'We commission urgent care services in South Tyneside.

'While we cannot comment on individual cases, all our providers are expected to deliver good services and where appropriate, services should signpost and direct patients onwards to other relevant services, and seek appropriate assistance where necessary.'
