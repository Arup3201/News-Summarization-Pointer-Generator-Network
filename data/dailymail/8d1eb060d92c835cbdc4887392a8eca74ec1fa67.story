Chelsea starlet Cristian Cuevas will be back at Stamford Bridge in no time if he continues to grab the attention of Jose Mourinho.

The 19-year-old Chile Under 20 left winger would have done just that by scoring an outstanding free-kick while representing his country.

Cuevas, who joined Chelsea from Chilean outfit O'Higgins for £3million in 2013, smashed the ball past Brazil's helpless goalkeeper Marcos from just under 35 yards.

Chile's Under 20 side went on to lose 2-1 against Brazil but Cuevas will have been delighted with his strike, despite the final scoreline.

Cuevas has been sent out on loan to Vitesse, PSV Eindhoven and current side Universidad de Chile since joining Chelsea.

The left-sided player, who is capable of playing in defence and midfield, returned to his homeland on a temporary loan deal in the summer.
