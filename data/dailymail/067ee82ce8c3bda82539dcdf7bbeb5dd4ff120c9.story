A new bill recently introduced to Congress would exercise some control over the use of Photoshop in advertising.

Two Congresswomen, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R) and Representative Lois Capps (D), of Florida and California, respectively, have introduced a bill titled H.R. 4341: Truth in Advertising Act of 2014.

If passed, the bill would provide corporations with strategies for reducing their use of altered images, as well as guidelines for the appropriate uses of Photoshop.

Cracking down: Two Congresswomen have introduced a bill that would monitor the use of Photoshop in advertising, much like the UK's Advertising Standards Authority which banned the use of this Natalie Portman ad

According to Time, the legislation has
 already received support from lobbyists, including those affiliated 
with the Eating Disorders Coalition.

E.D.C.
 members reportedly met with lawmakers late last month to voice their 
concerns about how Photoshopping can negatively impact the mental state 
of those prone to, or suffering from eating disorders.

Representative
 Capps said of the bill earlier this month: ‘Just as with cigarette ads 
in the past, fashion ads portray a twisted, ideal image for young women,
 and they’re vulnerable. As sales go up, body image and confidence 
drops.’

The program would be monitored by the Federal Trade Commission.

The
 organization would be responsible for presenting a comprehensive report
 to Congress 18 months after the bill passes that includes sociological 
findings and recommended regulations relating to Photoshop.

There is no framework right now for the repercussions companies would experience for defying the bill.

At present, advertising officials appear skeptical of how much impact the legislation could actually have.

Dan Jaffe of the Association of National Advertisers feels that the legislation will fail without added specificity.

Regulating: If passed, the bill would outline strategies for corporations to reduce their use of Photoshop, as well as limitations (pictured, a Julia Roberts Lancome ad that was banned by the UK's ASA for its unrealistic portrayal of Ms Robert's appearance)

He
 said: ‘It can’t just be the Photoshopping that they go after, it would 
have to be tied to something specific. Are you just going to say that 
whenever someone Photoshops it’s a per se violation? I think that would 
be going too far.’

A voting date for the bill has not yet been set.

If
 passed, H.R. 4341 would be the closest thing that the U.S. has to the 
UK’s Advertising Standards Authority – an NGO watchdog group that 
determines which ads are allowed to run across the country.

The
 ASA is known for taking a stand against ads that portray unrealistic 
beauty ideals (such as a Julia Roberts Lancome ad that was banned for 
Photoshopping) or false claims.
