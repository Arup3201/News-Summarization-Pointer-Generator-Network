He may be the one of the most famous businessmen on the planet with a Hollywood film based on his life, but a family of foxes have overtaken Mark Zuckerberg as the biggest celebrities at Facebook's headquarters.

The cute quintet have taken up residence at Menlo Park, near San Jose, California, and they have now become the unofficial mascots of the site.

The so-called FB foxes have been given their own tribute page on the social network website and so far have almost 80,000 'likes'.

Celebrities: The fox family are regularly seen roaming Menlo Park in California

Loved: Employees regularly post pictures of sightings of the foxes but are not allowed to feed them

Some of the thousands of employees that work at the site regularly post pictures of the foxes whenever they are sighted.

The family are seemingly tame, and unusually for the primarily nocturnal animals, the foxes are often seen wandering around the 57-acre campus.  

They are so comfortable with the employees that they have also been pictured sleeping on car hoods.

Even Facebook billionaire has joined in on the action and was pictured last month looking at a cub out his office window.

It was uploaded to the site with the caption 'FB Fox crashes Zuck's meeting'.

The cubs are now moving on but Facebook hopes the adults will have more cubs on site next year.

Although, employees get very excited 
when they see these little celebrities, they have all been urged to 
remember they are wildlife.

A note on the Facebook page asks: 'A page to appreciate the fantastic FB Fox at MPK.

'Share your celebrity sightings here! Please honor the MPK Fox - no chasing or feeding - just mutual respect.'

That has advice has worked so well that the company has been presented with a Certified Wildlife Habitat plaque by the National Wildlife Federation, reports GrindTV.

The certificate is now displayed in Menlo Park's Zen garden.

NWF naturalist David Mizews wrote in his blog on the foundation's website: 'The Facebook foxes are a perfect symbol of the fact that the natural world isn’t just in faraway, exotic places.

'It’s all around us, sometimes literally right outside our doors. Good stewardship of wildlife habitat in our cities and towns means that all it takes to have amazing animal encounters is to simply get outdoors.'
