Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Raheem Sterling after the Liverpool youngster only started on the bench for England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia - by revealing Sir Alex Ferguson used to give Cristiano Ronaldo time off during mid-season to rest.

Sterling complained of feeling tired ahead of the clash and did not complete training on Saturday before asking manager Roy Hodgson to be rested.

But former Three Lions defender Ferdinand has backed the 19-year-old's decision on Twitter, claiming English players are often 'too proud' to take time out to rest and believes it could benefit the youngster in the long run. And he also revealed Ferguson used to give Ronaldo 'a few weeks off' during mid-season to recuperate.

In a series of tweets, Ferdinand said of the 19-year-old: 'Sterling - tired, fair play to him. English players are normally too proud to do that unlike our foreign friends. #FreshWhenItMattersMost.

'For instance, (Carlos) Tevez would come in some days (at Manchester United) and sit on the massage bed while the team trained... "I'm tired... match day - firing & energised.

'Either some real dumb heads on here or they just missed the point totally. Doing what's better for the team & yourself long term...

'With more rest at the right times throughout seasons (Wayne) Rooney would have gone into tournaments for England fresher 100%... Too proud again.

'Same could be said of (Steven) Gerrard, (Frank) Lampard, JT (John Terry), A. (Ashley) Cole, myself, etc. - all too proud to set out of training or a match with the bigger picture in mind.'

Also, in reply to a tweet which read 'didn't fergie used to give Ronaldo a few weeks off mid season early in his career', Ferdinand replied: 'yes... defo helped him develop'.

Sterling only played 45 minutes in Thursday’s 5-0 win over San Marino and was replaced by Adam Lallana at half-time but he came on for Jordan Henderson after 64 minutes in Tallinn on Sunday.

Adam Lallana replaced Sterling against San Marino on Thursday and starts in his place in Estonia 

Lallana started in place of Sterling in Tallinn but, after coming, on the livewire forward won the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored.

'Yesterday we trained  but Raheem was complaining a little about being tired and was not at his best. So we won't risk him and Lallana is in fine form,' Hodgson told ITV before the game.

'We can use him as a sub. Adam was very good against San Marino and interpreted the role behind the two attackers very well.

'They are different types of players and both feature strongly.' 

Given Hodgson’s comments on Thursday, it was perhaps no surprise that Lallana started.

He said: ‘Lallana, when he came on for Raheem, was every bit as dangerous and inventive and creative as Raheem could be. That's nice to know.’

Sterling trained with the England substitutes before the game and took part in a game of keep ball. He then took part in shooting practice - blasting his first effort well wide, and his second over the bar.

He was more effective when he came on, however. 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will hope Sterling will be fit during a busy spell of upcoming fixtures, with their next three games played within six days: Oct 19 – QPR (a), Oct 22 – Real Madrid (h), Oct 25 – Hull (h).
