A former Utah beauty queen and three other teens took a plea deal on Thursday after being accused of tossing homemade bottle bombs in a Salt Lake suburb.

Kendra McKenzie Gill and the other 18-year-olds pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a chemical device, a misdemeanor.

The charges will be dismissed after they complete 200 hours of community service. In addition, each was fined $500.

Felony charges were dropped as part of the plea agreement.

Plea deal: Kendra McKenzie Gill and the other 18-year-olds pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a chemical device, a misdemeanor

In court: Gill topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in June in the Salt Lake City suburb, showing off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and taking home a $2,000 scholarship

The defendants were initially accused of driving around last month to toss plastic bottles filled with a toilet bowl cleaner that reacted with aluminum foil to explode.

They said it was a harmless prank. No one was injured.

The other teens who settled the case 
were John Patrick Reagh, Shanna Marie Smith and Bryce Christopher Stone.
 None of the defendants commented after the hearing.

Gill was Miss Riverton until she relinquished her crown after her arrest.

Family members and friends of the teens packed the courtroom on Thursday and traded hugs after the proceeding.

'We're just happy it didn't come to a felony charge,' said Steve Reber, a friend of the Gill family.

The case was fast-tracked because none of the defendants has a criminal history, court officials said.

Gill topped a slate of nine beauty contestants in June in the Salt Lake City suburb, showing off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and taking home a $2,000 scholarship.

Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes

Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs

Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision

Contestants in the pageant — a 
preliminary competition for the Miss Utah and Miss America competitions —
 were required to sign a contract certifying they have not been 
convicted of a crime and don't have criminal charges pending against 
them.

Pageant officials can revoke a title if a contestant is criminally charged during her reign.

All four teenagers have previously acknowledged they were throwing the homemade bombs 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit.

'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said earlier this month.

'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.'

Scene: The teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences, including that pictured, in Riverton

Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone.

'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.'

'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.'

'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Captain Mecham told the television station. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.'
