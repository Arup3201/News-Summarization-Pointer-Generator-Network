A 15-year-old schoolboy has created one of the world's top apps in just a couple of hours - while he was bored in a class.

Ben Pasternak, from Sydney’s east, created the app 'Impossible Rush' while he was bored in a Year 9 science class, with the help of an American teenager he met through Facebook.

The app is quickly climbing the charts in the US, Sweden and Australia, and has been downloaded more than 300,000 in the six weeks since it launched.

‘Oh my god, we’re number three!’ Ben said during his interview with Daily Mail Australia.

‘Sorry, I just refreshed and we’ve climbed up third on the App Store. We were number five.

‘We’re ahead of Instagram, Pinterest ,Spotify, Shazam: all the big players!

‘The only apps ahead of us are Facebook and Facebook messenger - they’re next!’ quips the ambitious teen.

Ben Pasternak, from Sydney’s east, created the app ‘Impossible Rush’ while he was bored in a Year 9 Science class, with the help of an American teenager whom he met through Facebook.

The app was created by the two teenagers in August, and in six weeks has climbed to number three on the Aussie App Store

Ben is an incredibly bright student at Reddam House School in Woollahra, but confesses: ‘I’m currently not going too good at school, but I believe my app development career is more important right now.’

In August, Ben was distracted during class when he contacted a friend, 15-year old Chicago schoolboy Austin Valleskey, who he met through Facebook group ‘High School Hackers.’

‘I was a little bored so I opened by laptop and I messaged Austin in America.

‘I asked him, “Do you want to quickly just make a little game or something?”

‘He said “yeah of course’ and the game came out of nowhere, I just designed it in Photoshop.”’

Ben sent his version to Austin and an hour later, Austin sent him the prototype, which had been designed using xcode, a program used to design iPhone apps.

‘It was really fun so we decided to launch it.’

Ben is excited about his new project, app 'One' which allows users to use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on the one sleek app 

‘I realised I was onto something after seeing people playing our trial app and the fact that we have the best marketing an app could have.’

The marketing came when they contacted New York-based social media marketer Carlos Fajardo, who they sold the app to for $200.

‘I had no problem giving Carlos the app due to the fact I made it for fun and had no intentions to launch it,' said Ben.

‘Marketing is everything, most developers don’t even consider the concept of marketing their work.’

The entrepreneur is now on the brink of launching his new app, ‘One’ which will allow users to combine Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It has taken months of work.

‘Impossible Rush was the first game I have made. It doesn’t represent my work - just a bit of fun.

'‘One’ is my primary focus. I am extremely passionate about the concept and the problem I am solving.'

Ben tells Daily Mail Australia: '‘I love what I do so it isn’t stressful. What is stressful is juggling it with school.'

Although Ben is entertaining designing his own platforms and hardware, he is 100 per cent committed to his new business model. 

‘I will not stop app development til ‘One’ is number one on the App Store.

’Apps are awesome. They might not last in 10 years but the concept of downloading a developer’s project without having to buy it physically will remain for a while.’ 

It all started for Ben when he was eight, he started to play the Disney online children’s game, Club Penguin.

‘With Club Penguin, I tried to push boundaries. I’d find hacks to get more coins for the game,’ Ben tells Daily Mail Australia.

As ‘Impossible Rush’ has gained popularity, Ben has been inundated with exciting new offers.

‘I’ve had multiple job offers and been asked to motivate students studying i0S development at universities,' said Ben.

‘‘I was offered a few part time and a few full-time jobs but I’m currently not really planning on getting a job, I’m focussing on my own project.

Ben has quickly gained international attention for his incredible innovations at such a young age

‘If I spoke at the universities I’d tell them: “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that do.”

‘The success has been extremely encouraging. People once doubted me based purely on statistics.’

Ben is also committed to finishing school and going to university. 

The app is taking up a lot of Ben’s time – but his passion for the project means he has been more than willing to devote months of his life to it.

‘I love what I do so it isn’t stressful. What is stressful is juggling it with school.

‘In my free time I work on my apps, nothing else.

'Even when I’m walking and talking with friends, I’m always thinking about the app in the back of the head.

Ben says that although he spends every possible moment on his app, he makes time to have fun like any other Aussie boy. 

‘Most people in this field are considered nerds but for me, I’m still like a normal teenager - I go see a movie, go to the beach, food, those kinds of things

According to Ben, he is in quite a bit of trouble with his school for putting his app first and schoolwork second!

‘I ignore projects and work on my app. A lot of the time I don’t finish it off until 2 in the morning

‘So I get in trouble at school a lot but I have good intentions! But they're nice about it.’

Ben first found notoriety with his YouTube channel, uploading videos of Apple product reviews – including a montage of when Ben was the first person in Sydney to get his hands on the new iPad Air.  

‘I’d love to work for myself in the future but if I had to work for any company, it’d definitely be Apple.’

Ben believes being a teenager gives him an edge as an entrepreneur.

‘Me being the young, the main target of apps, gives me an idea of what people want. This has been a great advantage.

‘No one in my team (developing ‘One’) is over the age of 22. I think younger people get the concept better.’

Ben turns to the Facebook group where it all began, High School Hackers, for support.

Of his super successful app, Ben says, 'Impossible Rush was the first game I have made. It doesn’t represent my work - just a bit of fun'

‘I didn’t learn this at school, I have purely encouraged myself, I found an interest in this and pursued it.

‘Communities like HS Hackers are really encouraging. It’s nice to see people with similar interest to me.’

‘The Facebook group is really cool. If I ever have a problem, I can post in one group and then instantly 2000 people who do the same thing as I do see it and can make suggestions.

A priority for Ben is focussing on what will be liked by the masses, which means a sleek look and universal appeal.

When it comes to One, he is a perfectionist. 

‘When I look at technology I think how can I make it cool. We need to make it pretty, beautiful – that’s the marketing side I guess.’ 

Ben says seeing the app being played by strangers is the most exciting aspect of the experience.

‘It’s so cool. On any bus, any bus station… I can see people playing everywhere I go

'It’s exciting, like my visions have happened.' 

The new app will be launched in the next one to two months.
