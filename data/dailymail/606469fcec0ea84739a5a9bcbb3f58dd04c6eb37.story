Thiago Silva leapt high, and powered a fantastic header looping over the head of Thibaut Courtois into the far corner of Chelsea's net, dumping Jose Mourinho's team out of the Champions League.

It was, undoubtedly, a brilliant piece of play from the Brazilian, but immediately the inquest began as to how Chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space.

The answer, it seems, is that captain John Terry, rather than marking his opponent, was tussling with his central defensive partner as the corner came in.

Terry did eventually find a way past his colleague, but arrived too late and couldn't get off the ground, leaving Silva free to head home.

The goal drew PSG level on the night, and in the tie, but the vital second away goal sent the visitors through to the quarter-finals.

It was also the second goal Chelsea had conceded from a corner to a PSG centre half, after David Luiz had sent the game to extra time.

The PSG captain still had plenty to do, but his looping header gave Thibaut Courtois no chance at all
