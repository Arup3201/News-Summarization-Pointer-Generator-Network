David Cameron today admitted he made a mistake by taking Andy Coulson into Downing Street as his chief spin doctor.

The Prime Minister issued a 'full and frank' apology for his decision to hire the former editor of the News of the World, adding: 'I am extremely sorry I employed him. It was the wrong decision.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband said that Mr Cameron had 'brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street' and his Government was 'tainted' as a result.

Prime Minister David Cameron promised to make a 'profound apology' if his former director of communications Andy Coulson was found guilty of wrongdoing

Coulson worked as director of communications for the Tory party and later the government from 2007 to 2011

After resigning from the newspaper in 2007, Coulson became director of communications for the Tory party before taking on the same role when the coalition was formed in 2010.

Coulson has been found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper. 

The jury is still considering further charges against Coulson and former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office by paying police officers for two royal directories.

In a recorded statement in the Cabinet Room today, Mr Cameron said: 'I always said that if they turned out to be wrong I would make a full and frank apology and I do that today.

'I'm extremely sorry that I employed him, it was the wrong decision and I'm very clear about that.'

Pressed on the assurances he sought before hiring Coulson, the PM added: 'I asked him questions, if he knew about phone hacking and he said that he didn't and I accepted those assurances and I gave him the job.

'I would say that no-one has made any complaints about the work that he did for me either as leader of the opposition or indeed here in Number 10 Downing Street.

'But knowing what I now know and knowing that those assurances weren't right, it was obviously wrong to employ him.

'I gave someone a second chance and it turned out to be a bad decision.'

Mr Cameron walked off camera and left the room without answering the final question from his interviewer, ITV political editor Tom Bradby, who asked: 'On a human level do you feel sorry for him?'

Within minutes of the guilty verdict against Coulson being announced, the issue was raised in the House of Commons.

Chancellor George Osborne, a cheerleader for hiring Coulson on the Conservative staff, was accused of bringing the government into disrepute.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'I think David Cameron has very, very serious questions to answer, because we now know that he brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street.

'David Cameron was warned about Andy Coulson, the evidence mounted up against Andy Coulson. David Cameron must have had his suspicions about Andy Coulson, and yet he refused to act.

'Now, I believe this isn't just a serious error of judgment. This taints David Cameron's Government, because we now know that he put his relationship with Rupert Murdoch ahead of doing the right thing when it came to Andy Coulson.

'This was not some small or accidental mistake. He stuck with Andy Coulson over a long period of time, and it wasn't like there wasn't information out there to arouse his suspicions. He was warned by the Deputy Prime Minister. He saw front page stories in newspapers. He was warned by newspaper editors. And yet still he refused to act and even today defended some of the conduct of Andy Coulson when he worked for him.

'I think David Cameron must do much more than an apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on these allegations against Andy Coulson, why as the evidence piled up he didn't do anything about it, and he's got to explain.'

The Tories' decision to take on Coulson was always controversial, coming after his resignation from the News of the World.

He publicly denied any knowledge of phone-hacking at the newspaper, but quit taking responsibility for the single case of Royal Editor Clive Goodman who was jailed for phone hacking. 

Chancellor George Osborne was among the key figures who pushed for Coulson to be hired by the Tories

When the Tories formed a coalition with the Lib Dems, Coulson moved from Tory HQ to Downing Street as the government's Director of Communications.

But renewed questions about phone-hacking emerged in 2009, leading to calls for Mr Cameron to sack his close aide. Amid mounting pressure, he stayed in post until January 2011, when he quit.

In July that year, Mr Cameron promised to apologise if Coulson was found guilty of wrongdoing. 

He told MPs: 'I have said very clearly that if it turns out Andy Coulson knew about the hacking at the News of the World he will not only have lied to me but he will have lied to the police, to a select committee, to the Press Complaints Commission and, of course, perjured himself in a court of law.

'More to the point, if that comes to pass, he could also expect to face severe criminal charges.

'I have an old fashioned view about 'innocent until proven guilty'. But if it turns out I have been lied to, that would be a moment for a profound apology.

'And, in that event, I can tell you I will not fall short.' 

Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls accused George Osborne of bringing the Treasury into disrepute by pushing for the Tories to hire Coulson in 2007

In the Commons, Labour's Ed Balls challenged Mr Osborne about his role in pushing for the Tories to hire Coulson as the party's communications director.

Mr Balls said: 'Does the Chancellor now accept that it was a terrible error of judgement...'

But he was cut off by Commons Speaker John Bercow, who warned the question was not relevant to Treasury questions.

Allowed another attempt at raising the issue, Mr Balls went on: 'Does the Chancellor accept that he has brought into disrepute the office of Chancellor and of the Treasury by urging the Prime Minister for his own reasons to bring Mr Coulson into government and has he not done damage to his own reputation and the government's?'

Mr Osborne brushed the comments aside, taking a swipe at Mr Balls own background in the Labour spin operation.

'The person who worked alongside Damian McBride is not a person to give lectures on this,' he said, in reference to Mr McBride having to resign from Gordon Brown's government for plotting smears.

In a statement later Mr Osborne said: 'I too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ Andy Coulson.

'He gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case. We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it's clear that we made the wrong decision.

'It's important for the victims of phone hacking that this has now been properly dealt with by the courts; and it matters for us all that we have a free and vibrant press which operates within the law.' 

During his trial, Coulson admitted that he never told the Tories he knew of the hacking of Labour home secretary David Blunkett's voicemail in 2004 because, if he had come clean, he probably would not have got the job. 

The 46-year-old maintained that he thought chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck was responsible and not Mulcaire.

In his earlier evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in 2012, Coulson said Mr Cameron asked him about the Goodman case. He told the inquiry: 'I said to him what I said publicly - I knew nothing in terms of what they did.'

Mr Cameron did not seek any more assurances over Coulson's links to phone hacking, despite allegations about legal pay-offs for victims being published in the Guardian in July 2009, the inquiry heard.

Instead, the Prime Minister stood by his spokesman long after the first rumblings in the media that all the hacking at the NotW had not been exposed.

When Coulson resigned as Mr Cameron's media adviser in January 2011, he said: 'Unfortunately, continued coverage of events connected to my old job at the News of the World has made it difficult for me to give the 110 per cent needed in this role.'

The Prime Minister reacted by saying he was 'very sorry' that Coulson was 'compelled' to resign because of the continuing pressure over phone hacking.

After that, Coulson said he met up with Mr Cameron one more time in the spring of that year at a pre-arranged social event and had not spoken to him since.

Mr Cameron told the Commons in an emergency statement in 2011 that he took 'responsibility' for Coulson's recruitment.

'With 20:20 hindsight - and all that has followed - I would not have offered him the job and I expect that he wouldn't have taken it,' he said. 

'On the work he did, I will repeat, perhaps not for the last time, that his work at Downing Street has not been the subject of any serious complaint.'
