A close friend of L'Wren Scott has revealed that the 49-year-old fashion designer was planning to announce the closure
 of her business today.

According to fashion writer Cathy Horyn, Ms Scott committed suicide just two days before she was set to go public with the news that her 
fashion label would be discontinued.

Scott, who was also famous for being the girlfriend of Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, was found dead in her Manhattan apartment shortly after 10am on Monday.

Friends: Fashion critic Cathy Horyn (right, with L'Wren Scott at an event in October) has written a moving tribute to her deceased friend, saying how there were warning signs that she was stressed about her business

Ms Horyn, the New York Times former fashion critic, writes that she did not find out about the designer's plans to close her business until after Ms Scott's death.

In an article for the paper titled  'Memories of a Friend, a Teacher and a Fighter', Ms Horyn tells of how their friendship was tested when she adviced Ms Scott to give herself a deadline to sort her financial problems, or close the business for the sake of her health.

Tribute: Fashion critic Cathy Horyn revealed Ms Scott's plans in a moving tribute to her friend

'Two years ago, our friendship was tested when, after hearing her troubles, I told her she should give herself a time limit to resolve matters or get out. Putting her health in jeopardy because of stress was not worth it, I told her,' Ms Horyn wrote.

Ms Scott did not like the advice and instead worked even harder on turning her business into a success, which saw her collaborate with Banana Republic.

Ms Horyn explained that they communicated on close to a monthly basis since the fall, once with Ms Scott texting her about how a fitting in London was going very well- months before she cancelled her line's fashion show in the city.

Accounts
 for her business, filed in the UK in October 2013, show her company, LS
 Fashion LTD, had a deficit of £3,546,000 with the designer owing 
creditors £4,592,000.

She told an interviewer around that time she felt the 
financial pressure. ‘Every cheque, every penny, I have to be responsible
 for because it’s my own money.’

Ms Horyn said that the subject of Ms Scott's health came up again in February when, after sending condolences following the death of Ms Horyn's partner, a conversation made it clear that Scott was stressed.

She told Ms Scott that if she put the fashion line on hold, it would not be the end of her career,

'You’re entrepreneurial — that’s your strength. You’ll have new ideas. Just give yourself a break now,' Ms Horyn recalled telling her.

Former home base: Scott used to live in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles before selling the three-bedroom home (pictured) for $860,000 in 2009

Memorable: Horyn wrote how she had Thanksgiving dinner in 2006 in Scott's walled-in backyard with Jagger and a group of The Rolling Stones

Their last communication- a text sent from Ms Horyn- went unexpectedly unanswered just three days before the suicide.

'Her death is inexplicable to me, and it makes me angry, too. Angry
 because it’s the loss of a vital, intelligent woman, and angry because,
 this once, I don’t want her to be a mystery to me,' Ms Horyn wrote.

The tales of financial woe at the end
 of a long friendship between the two women. Ms Horyn said that they met
 in the 1990s but became close around 2000.

She praised Mormon-raised 
Scott for being warm, protective of young designers and caring when it 
came to her friends, citing a moment last fall when she offered advice 
in a time of need by texting Ms Horyn 'Dr Scott is on the line'.

Ms
 Horyn wrote of how Scott would host dinners in her Hollywood Hills 
home, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of
 Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled 
garden.

According to property records and real estate reports, Scott sold the three bedroom home in July 2009 for $860,000.

'I
 can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what 
gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West. And without it, maybe
 she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Ms 
Horyn wrote.

Close: Ms Horyn wrote how Scott was very encouraging of young designers, protective of her friends, and private about her personal history, joking that Ms Horyn didn't know if she had been married once or twice before

GFlossy front: Despite a long line of famous fans, including Michelle Obama, L'Wren Scott's fashion line was a financial failure and she owed creditors nearly $6million

Although it was initially reported that she refused any financial help from Mick Jagger, her partner of 13 years, it appears the did help fill the gaps.

Another source today told The Mirror that Jagger, who is worth around £200m, has 'always supported L'Wren financially up to the hilt'.

The
 friend added: ‘He knew she wasn’t a great businesswoman, but he had no 
idea about the extent of the debts. But he always supported her, 
financially and in other ways.’

Since he received the news of her 
suicide, the 70-year-old Rolling Stone has not slept and is allegedly so
 grief-stricken that he can barely speak.

Jagger's
 fellow Rolling Stones have today paid their tribute to L'Wren Scott as 
they join his family in supporting him through his grief.

Yesterday Jagger offered a touching 
tribute to his longtime love, as 
the Rolling Stones announced their Australia and New Zealand tour has 
been cancelled.

In shock: Mick Jagger,seen leaving Coco's Restaurant in Perth, Western Australia, just moments after hearing the news of girlfriend L'Wren Scott's death, has reportedly not slept since

Family support: Georgia May, left, who cancelled an appearance at a Melbourne fashion event,  and her sister Elizabeth Jagger, right, have allegedly both flown to Perth to support their father at this difficult time

'I am 
still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end 
her life in this tragic way,' the Rolling Stones frontman wrote on his website in a heartbreaking post titled 'L'Wren'.

'We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves.

'She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.

'I
 have been touched by the tributes that people have paid to her, and 
also the personal messages of support that I have received.

'I will never forget her,' he wrote before signing off, 'Mick.'
