Cradling his baby in one arm and brandishing an assault rifle in the other, this is the British jihadist who skipped bail to fight for Islamic State.

Siddhartha Dhar posted the photograph online to taunt the police and security services whose blunders allowed him to flee the UK.

The 31-year-old – one of hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s top henchmen – is apparently living in Syria almost a month after he went on the run with his pregnant wife and family while under investigation by Scotland Yard.

The fugitive, also known as Abu Rumaysah, posted the image on his Twitter social media account which bears his Muslim name with the hashtag Generation Khilafah – a reference to the so-called caliphate.

Sickening: This morning Siddhartha Dhar uploaded this image of him posing with a gun and his newborn baby boy in Islamic State-held area of Syria

Siddhartha  Dhar, circled, disappeared only 24 hours after being released on police bail, the follower of Anjem Choudary, centre, took a coach to Paris with his family before travelling on to Syria

Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists.

He wrote: ‘Alhamdulillah [all praise be to Allah], Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he’s definitely not British. Will try to post a pic of him soon.’

In a picture posted yesterday, Dhar was standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots.

He cradles the baby against his chest with his left arm, his son’s face peeking out of a tightly-knitted babygrow. Dhar holds an AK47-style assault rifle in his other hand, with the barrel pointing toward the sky and away from his child.

The black IS flag is the Twitter account’s profile image.

Dhar, a father of four from Walthamstow, was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting radical cleric Anjem Choudary and the banned militant group al-Muhajiroun.

He is believed to have met, and possibly mentored, Michael Adebolajo, one of the murderers of Fusilier Lee Rigby.

Taunt: Dhar - who goes by the name of Abu Rumaysah - apparently tweeted these messages on Monday

Dhar was released on bail and ordered to hand in his passport. But less than 24 hours after walking free, he took a coach from London to Paris and headed to the Islamic State war zone with his young family.

Prior to posting the photo, Dhar taunted the police on Twitter for clumsily allowing him to slip through their fingers: ‘What a shoddy security system Britain must have to allow me to breeze through Europe to the Islamic State.’

He also boasted how he had fooled MI5, the British intelligence service: ‘My Lord (Allah) made a mockery of British intelligence and surveillance.

‘Make hijrah (flight) Muslims. Place your trust in Allah.’ Proclaiming his love for Islamic State and the importance of the fight against the West, Dhar wrote: ‘The Islamic State will punish the tyrants in the West. The army of Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is coming. Rejoice O Muslims.’

Dhar, who has been courted by broadcast media and repeatedly given a platform on the BBC and Channel 4 to promote his radical views, had publicly stated that he wanted to live under the Islamic State in Syria.

A few weeks before his arrest, he told one interviewer that he was willing to renounce his British citizenship if it meant he was allowed to travel.

Dhar was also interviewed by CBS News’s 60 Minutes programme about radicalisation in the UK earlier this month, telling presenter Clarissa Ward that he was unable to love his mother because she was not a Muslim.

Titled ‘Campaigning for ISIS in the West’, the episode focused on Choudary’s band of London-based radicals.

It is understood that Dhar is of Indian origin and was brought up a Hindu before converting to Islam. He was a key member of al-Muhajiroun and offshoot groups such as the Shariah Project, masterminding ‘roadshows’ in London that aimed to recruit troubled youngsters to Islam.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said last night: ‘Dhar was bailed to a date in January next year with bail conditions. Police are now working to establish his whereabouts.’

Dhar was among  nine men including Choudary, right, held and questioned by police in September 

Yesterday a woman in her twenties who is believed to be Dhar’s sister spoke of how her family had been trying unsuccessfully to contact him since he left the country.

Speaking on the doorstep of her terraced home on the busy North Circular road at Edmonton, north London, she said: ‘We ourselves are trying to reach out to him and haven’t found a route.’

As she spoke, a second woman, thought to be Dhar’s mother, appeared cradling a baby.

More than 500 Britons are feared to have travelled to Syria, with many joining Islamic State.

Around half are suspected to have returned already.
