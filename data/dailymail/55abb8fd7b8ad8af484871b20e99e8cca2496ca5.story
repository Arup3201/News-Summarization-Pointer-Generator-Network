An Arctic blast is due to batter Britain over the next few days with temperatures expected to plunge to -7C by next week.

Forecasters have also warned that strong winds and heavy rain could bring a weekend of wet weather misery to most parts of the country, triggered by the massive snowstorms in the US.

The cold and wet weather has been sparked by a 'meandering' jet stream with winds of 200mph, which will allow freezing air from the Arctic to sweep across the UK.

It was a foggy morning along the River Nene embankment in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire yesterday. More fog is expected as temperatures could drop to below -7C by next week

The Met Office said the distinct downward trend began last night, as recent mild temperatures were replaced with a cold snap which hit the north of England.

The lowest recorded temperature was in Glascarnoch, Scotland, where temperatures dipped to a chilly -2C. 

Southern England managed to escape the bitter weather, with minimum temperatures in the south west remaining at around 10C.

But, by Sunday night, most parts of the country will be in for a shock as temperatures again dip to around -3C, causing heavy frost on Monday morning.

That cold spell will stick around for the beginning of next week, as forecasters warn temperatures in the Scottish Highlands could plummet to -7C.

Simon Partridge from the Met Office said: 'There will be a far chance of frost around on Monday morning, mainly in central areas.

'It will come after a cold night on Sunday, when temperatures will be around -3C.

'But it will be nice and dry and still not far off average temperatures for this time of year. But, because of the mild weather we have been having, it will feel a lot colder.' 

Forecasters have warned that the snowstorms in the US, pictured is West Seneca in New York, could trigger strong winds and heavy rain across much of the country

Forecasters say the higher temperatures seen in the south last night will stick around today, with the mercury expected to reach a a balmy 15C in some parts.

But a band of heavy rain will bring misery to Britain for the next 24 hours, leaving almost no part of the country dry.

Downpours and strong winds will slowly sweep across the country today and tomorrow, causing an onslaught of grey and unpredictable weather.

The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' wet weather warning for Grampian and Central, Tayside and Fife for today and tomorrow, where up to 40mm of rain is expected to fall.  

There will also be a high chance of thunder in the south west tomorrow, while particularly heavy rain is expected in Wales. The only expected glimpses of sunshine will be in the north.

Forecasters say that unsettled weather will continue through to Sunday, particularly in southern England. 

Thick fog descended on the roads in Peterborough at rush hour yesterday evening. Forecasters have warned it will be colder on Sunday night, with some frost and fog developing

It will then clear to make way for the colder weather, which could also bring a heavy dose of mist and fog. 

The coldest areas will be around the Wales, the West Midlands, eastern Scotland and central southern areas.

But forecasters ruled out the US freeze moving to the UK, saying the cold, snowy weather will stay on the western side of the Atlantic.

Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: 'The jet stream will weaken as it moves into the Atlantic.

'When systems reach our shores, they will start to weaken due to high pressure over Russia. 

This three-day forecast shows how most parts of the country will be wet over the weekend, with the best chance of sunshine in the north of England and Scotland 

'Cold air in the US was one of the factors in stronger jet last winter, but there were others. There's no sign of what happened last winter being repeated this winter.'  

Alexi Venerus from Meteogroup said the weather looked 'unsettled' with showery outbreaks expected.  

Leon Brown, from The Weather Channel UK, said the whole of Britain will  start to feel much colder by the beginning of next week.

He said: 'It is feeling quite cold on Sunday. It still looks like a frosty and icy start to Monday still across Wales and southern Britain with temperatures as low as -2C or -3C.

'A colder feel to the weather next week, and there will be more frosts, especially over the north.

'On Wednesday morning Scotland may see dawn temperatures as low as -7C.'
