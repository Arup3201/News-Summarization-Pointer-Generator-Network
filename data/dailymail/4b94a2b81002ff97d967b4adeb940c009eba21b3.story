They clutter up pockets  and fill up purses, yet can never be found when you need to get a refund.

Now experts predict the paper receipt has almost reached the end of the roll – and will soon be replaced by emails.

Major retailers including Tesco are looking into setting up a paperless receipts system, similar to one already used by technology giant Apple in its stores.

The end? Experts predict the paper receipt will soon be replaced by emails

Under the proposals, shoppers would have their purchase confirmations emailed to them instead of printed.

Former Tesco chief executive Lord MacLaurin, who has invested in a firm called Paperless Receipts, said: ‘Why, when most transactions are recorded digitally, are retailers still printing on paper?

‘They are environmentally damaging and onerous for the consumer to store safely.’

The company has raised £500,000 from private investors, is backed by computing firm IBM and is in talks with major retailers including Tesco.

Managing director Andrew Carroll said: ‘Within five years, 60 to 70 per cent of retailers will offer e-receipts in the UK.’

He added: 'Our solution is OPTIONAL and retailers will still print paper receipts for those that prefer.  We also do not email receipts - we use identifiers as chosen by you to attribute digital receipts to your personal web account. 

'You can give as much or as little information as you like and can remain anonymous if so desired. Equally promotions will only be offered to those that want them, they are again optional, and these will NOT be emailed to your email inboxes. They will be viewable on your eReceipts web account or smart phone. 

'eReceipts are automatically viewable on your smart phone to be able to check them in store and our system helps reduce fraud by creating an anonymous transaction trail between the retailer and the consumer. This is a consumer focused solution that solves a real problem and means that all your transactions can be viewed using one log in in one central area.'

The system designed by Paperless Receipts differs from  the one used by Apple in that the electronic receipt is emailed to a dedicated web address – which the customer can access – rather than the shopper’s general email inbox.

Mr Carroll said: ‘When receipts are emailed to you, your email inbox gets cluttered up with receipts instead of your pockets. What we offer is a centralised repository for all receipts.’

He added that he believed younger consumers, who are already comfortable with making payments using electronic devices such as mobile phones, will be first to adopt the trend.
