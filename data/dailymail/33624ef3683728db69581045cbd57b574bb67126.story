Detectives in New York are holding a 'person of interest' in the brutal murder of a British football coach who was stabbed to death and had his ear sliced off.

Michael Jones, 25, was left in a pool of blood yesterday after the 'frenzied' assault near Union Square, a popular destination for tourists in Lower Manhattan.

Police are currently interviewing a man who they believe was captured by security cameras calmly walking away from the spot.

Officers said the knifeman slashed his victim’s neck before stabbing him multiple times in his stomach and chest.

Victim: Football coach Michael Jones, 25, was stabbed numerous times in the savage attack

Mr Jones was from Tarleton, Lancashire. He moved to the US five years ago to pursue his dream of becoming a football coach

A piece of his ear was found on the pavement, and his wounds were so severe police believed they were dealing with a Halloween prank.

For the past five years, Mr Jones, of Tarleton, Preston, had been coaching children aged three to 13 with the New York Red Bulls, whose senior team includes former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and ex-Everton star Tim Cahill.

The Liverpool fan had been drinking with his girlfriend on Saturday evening when he left her to meet another friend.

He was returning to meet her when at 4.17am he got into an argument with his attacker, who has been described as a Hispanic man aged between 25 and 30, with a dark ponytail.

The incident is not thought to have been a robbery as Mr Jones’s iPhone was found at the scene. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.

Chilling CCTV footage shows the pair walking together as they rowed before the brutal assault begins. After the attack, the man is seen calmly walking away.

A police source said: 'It was a 
frenzy. The guy was chopped multiple times. He cut the guy’s ear off. It
 doesn’t get any more personal than that.'

Last night, Mr Jones’s 
parents Perry and Carole said their son ‘loved America’ and was 
‘ecstatic’ when he was offered a contract as youth team coach at the 
Major League Soccer team, working there for most of the year and 
returning to Lancashire in the off-seasons.

The family called the police after Michael’s brother Phillip, 23, received an alarming message from his friends in America.

'I contacted the police and I was totally shocked, I was expecting to hear he had been injured in an accident.

‘[The police] told us Mike had been 
murdered,’ said Mr Jones’s father, a 50-year-old IT manager. ‘We just cannot believe it. How was I 
to tell my wife and son?

'We’re all just devastated. All we know is that 
Mike was walking along a street when it happened.’

His son loved New York and was hoping to get a visa so he could stay there full time, he added.

The coach, who lived 
outside New York in the city of White Plains, spent much of his spare 
time visiting tourist attractions.

‘He said it was amazing to go out on a
 Saturday night,’ his parents recalled. ‘He would put our mind at ease 
by going on about how safe it was, that you could flag down taxis at any
 time and the tubes were so easy to use.’

Jessica Roth, whose son was coached by
 Mr Jones, said: ‘He had the patience of a saint with these kids. We’re 
devastated. How do you explain to children eight years old what 
happened? You can’t, because it’s a senseless crime.’

Before travelling to the US, Mr Jones had completed a sport science and technology degree at Lancashire’s Edge Hill University.

His parents said he had recently become ‘serious’ about a girl called Bryeanna.

Mr Jones’s father added: ‘He was 
always a very happy lad. He was doing a job that he wanted to do and we 
were very proud of him.’

The last time the family saw Mr Jones was three weeks ago, when he returned home to be best man at his best friend’s wedding.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance to Mr Jones’s family.

New York Red Bulls said: 'We are aware of this tragedy and on behalf of the entire organization, want to send our most heartfelt condolences to Michael's family, friends and loved ones.

'He was a tremendous individual, a fantastic coach who loved soccer and a terrific friend for many of us. This is truly a sad day for our soccer community and we will do our utmost to help authorities in their investigation of this case.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Michael's family at this time.'

Michael was a former player with Tarleton Corinthians and his former manager Dave Nelson said: 'I feel anger, upset and absolute devastation. You wouldn't want that to happen to anyone.

'Mike was such a nice guy - down to earth, outgoing, funny, always up for some banter but he knew when to be serious, loving and caring.'
