A super-rare prototype stormtrooper helmet from the original Star Wars film has emerged for sale for $5,000.

The iconic helmet is one of just six that were made during filming for 1977 hit Star Wars: A New Hope, the first of the six Star Wars films.

The 12-inch plastic prop was made by prop designer Andrew Ainsworth at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, where parts of Star Wars were filmed.

In an auction house far, far away... This super-rare stormtrooper helmet is being put up for sale

After filming was complete Ainsworth gifted the helmet to a friend who has had it ever since.

The helmet differs slightly to the ones that were used in the film - it has a ribbed back section that was dropped from the final design because it would make the helmets too hard to make.

The minimum bid for the prop, which is being sold at Californian auction house Nate D. Sanders, is $5,000 - but experts say it could fetch upwards of $20,000.

Sam Heller, from Nate D. Sanders, said: 'The origins of this stormtrooper helmet are in Britain.

'It was one of six prototype helmets made by prop designer Andrew Ainsworth at Shepperton Studies where the first Star Wars movie was being filmed.

'The prototypes were a work in progress and show the evolution of the stormtrooper helmet.

'This one is slightly different from the final helmet design because it features ribbing at the back which was deemed too difficult to make.

'The vendor is a private collector from the US who was gifted the helmet by Andrew Ainsworth after filming was complete.

'Our estimate is very conservative - it could easily go for $20,000 or more.

'Star Wars collectors are a very passionate bunch and they are often willing to pay big bucks for original items of memorabilia, especially something as rare as this.'

Star Wars was an instant hit on its release in May 1977 and remains one of the most financially successful films ever made.

It is credited with launching the careers of its stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher.

The film series has an enormous cult following worldwide and memorabilia from them are highly sought after.

The auction will take place in Los Angeles on July 31.
