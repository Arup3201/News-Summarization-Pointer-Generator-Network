A desperate graduate whose video interview as comedy legend David Brent went viral has bagged a chance at his dream job.

Will Bower, 21, finished his Business and Management Studies degree at the University of Sussex this summer and graduated with a 2:1.

But Will, from Crawley, West Sussex, struggled to secure work after graduating, despite applying for numerous jobs.

In a bid to stand out from the crowd, he uploaded a video interview to his website recruitwill.com turning to The Office character, played by comedian Ricky Gervais, for inspiration. 

The video caught the comedian's attention and several companies, including VCCP - one of London's top advertising agencies.

The CEO of the firm offered Will the chance to come into the office to have a tour before giving him a month's trial at his company - which he started today.

Will's video, which sees him answer a number of questions from a pretend interviewer, went viral and was even retweeted by Ricky Gervais.

Will said: 'I posted the video online and the video immediately went viral, the coverage just snowballed from there.

'After the video was posted online I was contacted by more than 20 companies and was offered a month's trial because of the video.

'Even Ricky Gervais retweeted a link to the story and it was then seen by his 2.3 million followers.

The 21-year-old, who finished his Business and Management Studies degree at the University of Sussex, has been unable to secure work, despite graduating with a 2:1

'I contacted the CEO at VCCP and he was very impressed with what I had done and invited me to have a tour of the office - he then offered me a trial.

'I was delighted but I am now feeling a mixture of nerves and excitement.

'Finding a job is very tough at the moment, there are thousands of graduates with similar degrees, so I had to do something different to get noticed.

'Thankfully my idea has paid off and I would encourage others to think outside the box to get noticed by employers.'

Will was contacted by more than 20 companies but chose to take the opportunity at VCCP.

Michael Sugden, the company's CEO, told MailOnline: 'Here's a guy who has no job offers and instead of moping around, he created his own marketing campaign.

'I think that should be commended. I think it's great. I liked his initiative and creativity. People like that deserve a chance.'

He added: 'So we've given him a month's trial and we'll take it from there.' 

In his video, Will talks about his time on BBC radio, meeting with the speaker of the House of Commons and passing his driving theory test first time - all in the style of David Brent.

In the video, speaking using his hand to portray other people asking him questions, he said: 'Why am I not employed? Good question.

Looking for a job: Will Bower made the hilarious video as a way to stand out from the crowd 

The video features him answering a number of questions in which he explains his qualities and experiences

'People say 'Oh, Will. Will, you're so successful already, aren't you?'

'Well yeah, cheers.

'(They say) 'Will, you passed your driving theory test first time, right?' Yeah.'

'Why are you not employed then?' The truth is, I've been waiting. Playing it hard to get, as they say.

'Tip - let the companies come to you. Don't go to the job, don't go to the job. Naturally, gravitate, synergy.'

Mr Bower added he has been 'loving life' and 'chillaxing' while he has been unemployed.

He goes on to say: 'I've made this video for the people and the places that I want to work for.

'So if you're a marketing or a HR manager and you work at a marketing firm, then I'm interested.

'Send me over the thing, I'll sign it and I'll see you Monday.

'Work is a way of life for me - it's a religion. Christians, they pilgrimage to Lourdes, Muslims to Mecca, but me? To your desk. To my desk, in your building.

'I want to work for you. See you Monday, cheers.' 

Will's first video proved so popular, he was asked to create another to promote the QA Gateway Programme, a campaign to help graduates into tech roles.
