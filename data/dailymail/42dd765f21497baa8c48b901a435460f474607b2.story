If Arsenal need a boost after their pre-season defeat against New York Red Bulls, they'll get it in the shape of Alexis Sanchez this week.

In the grand scheme of things their 1-0 loss to Thierry Henry's side in New Jersey doesn't mean an awful lot.

But if there were any glum faces on the six hour flight back to London on Sunday morning, the sight of their new £30million man should turn those frowns upside down.

Sanchez is due to report to London 
Colney to start pre-season this week, with French duo Mathieu Debuchy 
and Olivier Giroud due to follow soon after.

Arsene Wenger takes his side to their annual Austrian training camp tomorrow afternoon knowing his squad is slowly taking shape.

Defeat,
 albeit in a friendly is never ideal, but their whistlestop tour of the 
Big Apple was always more about commercial gain than football.  

Wenger
 started with a strong starting XI, Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, 
Wojciech Szczesny, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey all selected.

With Giroud still on his summer holidays, Wenger's lack of options at centre-forward saw Tomas Rosicky start as a lone striker.

But it was the hosts who carved out the first chance, with no prizes for guessing who was at the forefront of the move.

Henry's
 perfectly timed run was spotted by former Leeds winger Lloyd Sam, but 
for once the Frenchman's finishing was wasteful as he fired wide.

Cazorla
 stroked a curling effort from the edge of the area just wide before 
Henry turned provider for Bradley Wright-Phillips - Gunners legend Ian 
Wright's adopted son - in the ninth minute but the former Manchester 
City missed the target.

You 
couldn't help but smile when Tim Cahill clattered into close friend and 
ex-Everton team-mate Arteta in midfield, before Ramsey's strike from 
Rosicky's pass rolled just wide of Luis Roble's far post.

After
 an action packed opening, the encounter started to settle down, though 
flashes of Henry magic was enough to keep the crowd interested.

And the the MLS side took a deserved lead in the 33rd minute through Wright-Phillips.

Predictably,
 Henry had a hand in the goal, his corner causing havoc in the Gunners 
defence before Wright-Phillips nipped in front of Szczesny to toe-poke 
home with a finish his dad would have been proud of.

Wilshere,
 making his first pre-season appearance of the summer, went close to 
levelling five minutes later after a brilliant one-two with Gedion 
Zelalem, but his effort from eight yards was brilliantly saved by 
Robles.

The England 
midfielder, intent on getting back into Wenger's good books after his 
infamous trip to Las Vegas, went close again four minutes before the 
break - but his goalbound strike from the edge of the box was blocked by
 Cahill.

Wenger made a host of substitutions at half-time, among them French duo Abou Diaby and Mathieu Flamini.

And the changes nearly paid instant dividend, when Chuba Akpom set up Cazorla only for the Spaniard to fire straight at Robles.

Henry, as you would expect, was given a standing ovation as he was substituted in the 54th minute.

And
 Arsenal nearly took full advantage of the Red Bulls talisman's exit 
when Diaby, put through by Francis Coquelin, stroked the pall past 
Robles - but the effort was ruled out for offside.

But
 the visitors' bright second half opening gradually waned, despite the 
efforts of the impressive Coquelin in central midfield.

Akpom
 raced through with 12 minutes left on the clock, but with just Robles 
to beat the Gunners choked in front of goal leaving the goalkeeper to 
make a comfortable save.

But
 the hosts should have sealed victory just a minute later when 
substitute Peguy Luyindula sent his free header over the bar after Ruben
 Bover's cross.
