The family of the NHS boss  stabbed to death by her husband before he hanged himself have paid tribute to the 'devoted mother' who had a 'successful career'.

Yvonne Davies' body and that of her husband Andrew, 45, were found on Friday in a suspected murder-suicide after they failed to collect their seven-year-old daughter Emma from school.

The mother introduced celebrities such as  David Hasselhoff to sick children as part of her work as  the head of PR  at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Her family said: 'Our family are devastated by the sudden and terrible way Yvonne has been taken from us and we will all miss her terribly.

'Yvonne was a wonderful wife, mother, sister, daughter and friend. She had a successful career, but still managed to be a devoted mother who raised an amazing, beautiful daughter who is an absolute credit to both her parents. 

'As a family we now have to concentrate on looking after her daughter and helping her to come to terms with what has happened.' 

Neighbours said a man concerned for their welfare smashed open the front door of their semi-detached home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, with a hammer and made the discovery.

The body of Mrs Davies, who had sat as a magistrate since 1999, was uncovered in the kitchen and a post-mortem found that she died from multiple stab wounds with the likely weapon a kitchen knife.

Her 45-year-old husband was found upstairs at their £300,000 home and his post-mortem revealed that he died of asphyxiation due to hanging.

It is believed Mr Davies had been a stay-at-home father for the past five years and had recently returned back to work as a postman for Royal Mail.

Neighbours described him as a 'placid, doting father' who was regularly seen out and about with the couple's daughter.

Her family said: 'Our family are devastated by the sudden and terrible way Yvonne has been taken from us'

'He used to play with his daughter up and down the road on her scooter. He was a really good dad. He was always very friendly and came across as such a nice man,' a neighbour said.

'It is impossible to believe he could have done such a thing. Everyone is totally in shock.'

Mr and Mrs Davies married in January 2010 and their daughter, orphaned by the double tragedy, is being cared for by relatives.

Neighbours said the couple appeared to be fine in the days leading up to the incident and there were no outward signs of any marital trouble.

The family of Mr Davies have paid tribute to the 'intelligent' man and said his behaviour was 'totally out of character'. 

They said: 'Andrew was a kind, sensitive and intelligent man. He was an incredibly loving father who took five years out of work to spend time caring for his daughter. He was devoted to Emma.

'Andrew was much loved by his family and will be missed so much by us and his friends.

'What happened that day was totally out of character for Andrew and none of us, family or friends can believe what has happened.

'Our hearts go out to Yvonne's family, we are devastated for them. We are also heartbroken for our niece Emma, who has lost two loving parents.' 

Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths and are treating it as a 'murder-suicide'.

Mrs Davies was the head of communications and public relations at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs a number of hospitals.

As part of her role at the hospital, Mrs Davies met a host of celebrities who visited it including Manchester City midfielder David Silva and presenter Gethin Jones. 

One neighbour said: 'They were just perfectly normal people and there had been no rows or disturbances at their house. I don't think they had split up or anything.

She also met Manchester City midfielder David Silva (right) and was said to be a 'lovely' woman

'They just appeared to be carrying on with their lives. They were always friendly and pleasant.' 

Another said: 'My husband went to walk the dog and he said, 'There's something going on over the road.' There was a commotion and people standing outside the house. 

'Then a man, we're not sure who he was, smashed the front door with a hammer and got in. It was him who found them.'

Detective Superintendent Emily Higham said: 'We are still making enquiries into the deaths of these two people, to try and ascertain the exact circumstances leading up to this tragic incident.

'However we do not believe there is any third party involvement and we are not currently looking for anyone in connection with their deaths.'

Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to Mrs Davies and expressed sympathy for the couple's orphaned child.

Police officers are pictured working at the home of Mrs Davies and her husband Andrew in Stockport

Police forensic specialists carry out their investigation at the home. Neighbours said news of their death was a 'massive shock'

Chris Lomas said: 'This is tragic news. Yvonne was a genuinely lovely woman who always had time for you no matter how busy she was. RIP Yvonne. Sincere condolences to her family and friends. But most of all to her little girl - God bless.'

Matthew Porteus wrote: 'Absolutely tragic, no amount of stress should cause such an horrific outcome, sadly our society has become such a pressure for so many, money worries, depression, no way out, cost of living etc etc, RIP their tortured souls and God bless the poor little girl x.'

Emma Houldsworth: 'This is so terrible, the poor little girl left with no parents. I feel dreadful stepping out of my house to see all the forensic staff and police vans. Just wouldn't believe anything like this could happen on your street.'
