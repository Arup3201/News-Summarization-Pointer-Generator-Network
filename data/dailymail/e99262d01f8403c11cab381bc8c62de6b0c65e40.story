A multi-millionaire aristocrat whose £4million eco-home burnt to cinders on a castaway island has won a seven-figure damages claim against a building firm.

The Honourable Edward Iliffe, 45, bought Green Island, in Poole Harbour off the Dorset coast, for £2.5million in 2005 - and planned to develop a luxury holiday retreat for his family.

But the dream went up in flames - literally - in April 2012, when fire ravaged their cedar chalet as it approached completion, across the water from the millionaires’ playground of Sandbanks.

Disaster: A dream home off the Dorset coast went up in flames - literally - in April 2012, when fire ravaged the cedar chalet as it approached completion

Aristocrat:
 The Honourable Edward Iliffe, 45, bought Green Island for £2.5million in 2005 - and planned to develop a
 luxury holiday retreat for his family. He is pictured with the property as it was being constructed

Legal dispute: Feltham Construction, which oversaw much of the green building's development, denied that the chimney was 'assembled and installed in a non-standard and defective manner'

Mr Iliffe, and his wife Teleri, 49, of
 Newbury, Berkshire, launched legal action against Feltham Construction,
 a firm involved in building the home, demanding £3.5million in damages.

Yesterday, a top judge has
 ruled Feltham was indirectly responsible for the defective installation
 of a logburner or flue that caused the blaze - and ordered the firm to 
pay compensation.

Mr 
Justice Stuart-Smith, sitting at London’s High Court, said the 
six-bedroom solar-panelled home was in the final phase of construction, 
which included the fitting of a two-way log-burning stove with heat 
exchanger and stainless steel flue, when the fire ignited.

The
 logburner had been used for just two weeks, including by the Iliffe 
family who stayed at the chalet over Easter 2012, when an electrical 
contractor reported hearing ‘funny cracking noises’.

The
 blaze was discovered in the roof space at about 7am on April 20, 2011 
and, although 45 firefighters were ferried to the island, pumping 
seawater in a bid to douse the flames, the house was ‘largely 
destroyed’, the judge said.

The
 Iliffes and their three children, Alys, 17, Henry, 14, and Victoria, 
12, were heartbroken by the destruction of what they had hoped would be a
 Swallows and Amazons-style retreat.

Investigation: A forensic fire expert appointed by the family who examined the debris said the fire probably started 'within the roof construction and specifically in that part of the roof close to the chimney'

Smoking: The Iliffe family launched legal action against Feltham Construction, a firm involved in building the home, demanding £3.5million in damages

Blaze: Although 45 firefighters were ferried to the island, pumping seawater in a bid to douse the flames, the house was 'largely destroyed', the judge said

A forensic fire expert appointed by 
the family who examined the debris said the fire probably started 
‘within the roof construction and specifically in that part of the roof 
close to the chimney’.

His 
‘stong view’ was that combustible materials were closer to the chimney 
than the 1.97in (50mm) distance required, adding: ‘On the balance of 
probability, the cause of the fire was the failure to comply with 
building regulations when installing the flue’.

But
 Feltham, which oversaw much of the green building’s development, denied
 that the chimney was ‘assembled and installed in a non-standard and 
defective manner’.

It also disputed claims that the fire originated in the roof space and the value of the family’s £3.5million damages claim.

Feltham
 claimed it was not responsible as the flue and logburner were installed
 by a sub-contractor with whom it only placed an order on behalf of Mr 
Iliffe, who is the great grandson of newspaper magnate, Lord Iliffe.

Green Island: The Iliffes and their three children were heartbroken by the destruction of what they had hoped would be a Swallows and Amazons-style retreat

Plans: The six-bedroom solar-panelled home was in the final phase of construction, which included the fitting of a two-way log-burning stove with heat exchanger and stainless steel flue, when the fire ignited

Location: The island is just off the Dorset coast, near Poole and the exclusive Sandbanks peninsula

The firm also argued it oversaw the last phase of the works without a proper contract.

On the cause of the fire, Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said that, as it had never been suggested the logburner or chimney were inadequately designed, the Iliffes’ case that installation flaws caused the fire was ‘overwhelming’.

‘I therefore conclude with the certainty necessary to justify summary judgment that the fire was caused in the roof space as a result of defective installation of the logburner or flue... there is no realistic prospect of any other explanation or cause being established.’

The judge also found that an email from Mr and Mrs Iliffe’s architect ‘gave sufficient certainty for the conclusion of a contract’ with Feltham and that the instruction given for the firm to arrange the works were ‘clear’.

He ruled: ‘Feltham was responsible in contract for the acts and omissions of its sub-contractors’.

Mr Justice Stuart-Smith entered summary judgment for Mr and Mrs Iliffe against Feltham. The exact value of their damages award has yet to be assessed.
