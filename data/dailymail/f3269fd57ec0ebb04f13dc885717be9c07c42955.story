His representative confirmed the news to E! on Tuesday evening in a statement.

‘Chris Brown has elected to enter a rehab facility,’ the statement read. ‘His goal is to gain focus and insight into his past and recent behaviour, enabling him to continue the pursuit of his life and his career from a healthier vantage point.’

Rehab: Just two days after he was arrested for allegedly punching a man and breaking his nose, Chris Brown entered rehab on Tuesday evening

This comes the very day after Chris had his
assault charge reduced from a felony to a misdemeanour following his 
arrest on Sunday in Washington, D.C.

According
to TMZ, Brown pleaded not guilty and was released from custody without 
bail, and he was pictured smiling as he left court on Monday.

Brown was expected to co-headline a concert with girl band Danity Kane at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on Tuesday night, but he cancelled the gig ahead of checking into rehab.

Earlier on Tuesday, the star posted a cryptic tweet which read: 'In order to go where u have never gone u have to be willing to go where u never been!!!! #OHB! CBE!'

TMZ reports that Chris' attorney Mark Geragos brought him to the treatment centre, along with his mother and girlfriend Karrueche Tran,  where he will allegedly undergo treatment for 'anger management issues'.

On Wednesday it was reported that Chris was being being urged to stay in rehab for 'three months' and that he is residing in a facility in Malibu, California.

A source told TMZ: 'The rehab facility has been told to take him [Brown] apart and put him back together.'

The star, who is still on probation for beating his ex-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009, is reportedly open to remaining in care so he can learn how to cope with his anger management issues and prove he is serious about overcoming them, as he has been warned by his lawyer that he could be sentenced to up to four years behind bars if the judge decides he has violated his probation.

Karrueche has not spoken out about her boyfriend's decision to enter rehab, but she did post a picture of pair kissing on her Instagram account on Tuesday night with the caption, 'Always & Forever'.

Good news: The singer's assault charge has been reduced from a felony to a misdemeanour

Meanwhile, Chris’s rehab stint is causing problems for two nightclubs who were expecting him to host lavish Halloween parties.

On Thursday Chris was due to be the guest of honour at the Conga Room in Los Angles, but this has now been cancelled according to TMZ.

A second party, which was to have been co-hosted by Chris and Karrueche, will go ahead at Haze nightclub in Las Vegas on Friday even though the singer and his model girlfriend will not attend.

According to TMZ, following Chris's alleged assault on the man over the weekend, he was ordered to stay 100 yards away from the victim.

While it is not yet clear why Brown’s charge was reduced on Monday, it may be because the injuries were minor.

The
victim apparently claims Brown broke his nose but according to TMZ, the police have stated that the man was treated for a 
fractured nasal bone.

The
original police report allegedly states that it was Brown’s bodyguard 
who threw the punch, but the bodyguard's charge has also been reduced to
a misdemeanour.

The R&B singer along with 
Christopher Hollosy allegedly punched a man outside the upscale W Hotel 
in Washington at 4:25 a.m. Sunday, law enforcement sources said.

However, there were conflicting witness accounts, and Brown apparently denied punching the alleged victim, claiming the man tried to board his tour bus and his bodyguard 'handled it'.

Brown, who is due to appear in court again on November 25, was also accused of making a homophobic slur during the altercation that led to his arrest.

The alleged victim, Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland, told police Brown commented: 'I’m not down with that gay s**t,' when he attempted to get into a picture that the singer was taking with a female fan.

Conflicting accounts: Chris pleaded not guilty. It is unclear whether it was him or his bodyguard who threw a punch at the alleged victim, which the victim claimed broke his nose

Minor injuries?: It has been claimed that Brown and his bodyguard's charges may have been reduced because the victim was allegedly treated for a fractured nasal bone rather than a broken nose

Parker claims he replied: 'What are you doing?' and Brown answered: 'I feel like boxing.'

Parker alleges he was punched by 
Brown and then his bodyguard, and that the singer then went and stood 
behind the bodyguard and told Parker to 'walk away'.

TMZ further reports that the Los 
Angeles County Probation Department are now launching an investigation 
to determine whether the charges violate the terms of his probation relating to his 2009 assault on Rihanna.

The website claims the Probation 
Department was informed of the arrest by Brown's lawyer  Geragos, 
and he allegedly could face up to four years in prison if it is decided 
that his probation should be revoked.

His probation was briefly revoked in 
July after he was involved in a hit-and-run incident in Los Angeles, but
it was later reinstated in August.

The star was charged on May 21 with a
misdemeanour hit-and-run and driving without a valid licence following 
the accident in the San Fernando Valley.

Though he refuted claims by the other
driver involved, insisting he 'followed the proper procedures' and 
exchanged information with the owner despite there being no damage to 
his car.

After being 
arrested for assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in February 2009, the 
Turn Up The Music singer pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea 
deal.

On August 25 he 
was sentenced to five years' probation, one year of domestic violence 
counselling and six months' community service, while his five-year 
restraining order remained.
