A new woman has come forward with claims that Bill Cosby drugged and raped her - supermodel Janice Dickinson.

In a haunting new interview, Dickinson reveals that Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show, offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps.

That is one of the last things she remembers of the evening.

Shocking claim: Supermodel Janice Dickinson (above) has come forward to say she was drugged and rapped by Bill Cosby in 1982

Bad guy: Dickinson says after Cosby allegedly gave her the pill, the next thing she remembers is 'waking up with her pajamas off and semen between her legs'

'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' she told Entertainment Tonight.

'I remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs.'

Dickinson says her last memory of the night was of Cosby taking off his robe and climbing on top of her, and that the next morning she remembers 'a lot of pain.'

The supermodel claims the incident occurred in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982.

However, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, branded the allegation a 'complete lie.' 

She also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel, but that Cosby and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details. 

But Singer also flatly rejected this claim, saying: 'You can confirm with Harper Collins that she never claimed that Mr Cosby raped her, that no attorney representing Bill Cosby tried to kill the story... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about Bill Cosby in her book.'

In a statement, reported by NBC News, he added: 'There is documentary proof that Janice Dickinson is fabricating and lying about Bill Cosby.'  

Cosby answered the door in nothing but a white towel. He was fresh from the shower, too; his black skin was glistening. He hugged me, a little too enthusiastically; told me how much he'd missed me, and how nice it was to see me. I believed him. Liquor does that to a girl.

'God, you're beautiful.'

He kissed me, full on the lips, then went off to dress and we went downstairs, to dinner, where Cosby spent the next two hours talking about himself. It was An Evening with Bill Cosby. A Tribute to Bill Cosby.

And suddenly I remembered something Andy Warhol once told me. It was his definition of an actor. He said, 'An actor is a person whose eyes glaze over when the conversation is no longer about them.'

And I thought, Well, then, Bill Cosby is an actor's actor.

After dinner he asked me back to his room, and I went. But I stopped myself at the door. 'I'm exhausted,' I said, begging off. His eyebrows went a little funny.

'Exhausted?' he asked, and it was clear he was trying hard to keep his temper in check. 'After all I've done for you, that's what I get? I'm exhausted.'

'Well, gee, Bill,' I stammered. 'If I had known it was going to be like this—' He waved both hands in front of my face, silencing me. Then he gave me the dirtiest, meanest look in the world, stepped into his suite, and slammed the door in my face.

Janice detailed the events again of that evening in Lake Tahoe back in 1982

Janice says she is coming forward now because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do'

Dickinson did, however, detail some of her evening in Lake Tahoe with Cosby in the book, though telling a very different story.

She said she was drinking with Cosby at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired, at which point he slammed his door in her face.

The aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story.  

She says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do.'

As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words.

'How dare you,' she says.

'Go f*ck yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.'

Bombshell: At the time of the alleged rape, Dickinson (pictured in the 1980s) was one of the biggest models in the world

This comes as a third women, Joan Tarshis, came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by Cosby in Los Angeles back in 1969.

She called him a 'very, very sick man who needs help.'

Another of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, told MailOnline she was just 17 when he 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.'

Cosby, who refuses to comment on the allegations, did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior.

His lawyer John P. Schmitt has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.'
