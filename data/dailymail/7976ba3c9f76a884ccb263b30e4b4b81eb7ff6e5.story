A five-year-old boy has been killed in central India after being dragged from his home by a leopard.

The leopard attacked the boy on Monday evening as he was visiting the outdoor bathroom in the courtyard of his home in a village in Chhattisgarh state.

This is thought to have been the second deadly attack by the same leopard, local police said today.

The five-year-old was taken by the leopard from his home in Mendrapara village in Chhattisgarh, senior district police officer Vijay Pandey said.

A member of his family saw the boy being dragged away by the animal, and raised the alarm in the village.

A search party later found the boy’s body in the nearby jungle, which is close to an animal reserve.

According to officer Pandev, the same leopard killed a ten-year-old boy last December in a village nearby, and is also believed to have attacked livestock.

The Achanakmar Tiger Reserve is close to both sites, an animal reserve home to a dozen tigers as well as leopards.

‘The forest department has already launched a massive haunt to capture the leopard,’ he told AFP.

The leopard population of India is believe to be just over 1,100, as conservationists have warned it might become extinct as a result of bounty hunting for the animal’s skin.

About a third of the state of Chhattisgarh is forested, but as infrastructure increases, humans have moved into animal territory, making interaction with wild animals more common.
