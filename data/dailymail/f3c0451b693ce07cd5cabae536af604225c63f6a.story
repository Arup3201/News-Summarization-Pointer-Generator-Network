1996; the year Graeme Souness famously planted a Galatasaray flag into the Fenerbahce pitch after a Turkish Cup victory.

18 years on, the Scottish manager is still being idolised by the fans, so much so that they recreated the moment with choreography ahead of this season's derby.

An image of Souness planting the flag was projected in a Turk Telekom Arena stand using 'tifo'.

The former Liverpool player nearly sparked a riot after placing a large Galatasaray flag into the centre circle of the pitch of arch rivals Fenerbahce after his side had beaten them.

Explaining the incident, Souness explained in The Independent: 'The Fenerbahce vice-president had made some smart-arse comments about me being a cripple earlier in the season, and it was just a spontaneous action,'

'I got the biggest kiss of my life from the president.'

Galatasaray won the game 2-1, with Wesley Sneijder impressing.
