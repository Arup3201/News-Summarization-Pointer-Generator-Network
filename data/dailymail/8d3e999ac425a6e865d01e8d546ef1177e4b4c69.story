Police have been told to remove their names from the electoral register, it was claimed today.

The alleged guidance from the Metropolitan Police in London comes as security was dramatically stepped up for officers and the Jewish community in Britain amid fears of a terror attack.

Intelligence chiefs are worried that Islamist fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in France earlier this month that cost 17 lives. Four Jewish people and three police officers were among the dead.

Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge.

The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.

The guidance to Met officers was reported by The Sunday Times, which also claimed that an additional 800 counter-terrorism police could be deployed on Britain's streets.

In addition, the newspaper said Scotland Yard was in talks with the Home Office about extra funding to fight the increased threat to Britain.

The Met would not comment on whether police had been told to remove their names from the electoral register when contacted by MailOnline tonight. 

However, a spokesman said earlier today: ‘We do not discuss the details of our security response.

'But actions taken already include security advice to officers and staff; measures around police buildings; changing risk assessments that affect how we deploy to certain incidents; (and) bolstering levels of specialist support, including firearms officers.

‘The MPS has not decided to implement a blanket response regarding levels of crewing and patrolling in response to concerns about the risk of an attack on officers.’

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, who says there is a heightened concern about the safety of the Jewish community in the UK 

He added: ‘Senior officers across London have reviewed and will continue to review procedures as part of our established risk assessment process.

‘This will also take into account the risks to public safety, to ensure that any changes to our approach to patrolling, or responding to calls, recognises the potential risks to all communities.’

Last week, in other developments:

Mark Rowley, the UK’s senior counter-terrorism officer, said: ‘The global picture of terrorist activity does give us heightened concern about the risk to the Jewish community.’

The Met assistant commissioner said the murders at a kosher supermarket in Paris, coupled with a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric from extremists, justified more patrols in areas with large Jewish populations, including London, Leeds and Manchester.

There was a visible increase in security for the Duchess of Cambridge while on a visit to an event in north London last week, with bodyguards standing close to her at all times 

Some 263,000 people in Britain describe themselves as Jewish. The country’s 70 Jewish schools have been put on high alert.

The Community Security Trust, which advises Jewish institutions and groups on safety, said: ‘We spend an inordinate amount of money on security, particularly on our schools – as we should. 

'Obviously there’s a change in the threat level because there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen [in Paris].’

Mr Rowley added: ‘We are also considering what further measures we might put in place to enhance the security of police officers, given some of the deliberate targeting of the police we have seen in a number of countries across Europe and the world.’

He said the authorities were also looking at the safety of other minority communities.

Speaking after talks with President Obama at the White House, Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s very important to learn the lessons from anything happening elsewhere in Europe.

‘Could that happen here? What steps should be taken? So the police have announced today that they’ll be stepping up patrols, particularly to protect the Jewish community.

‘We have to be incredibly vigilant and look at all of these risks, particularly risks to police officers themselves and take every action that we can.’

The Prime Minister used the talks to press for tougher action to require internet firms to join the fight against terror by alerting authorities to suspicious exchanges online.

An official report last year concluded that Facebook failed to pass on information that could have prevented the murder of Fusilier Rigby and the site was a ‘safe haven for terrorists’.

The increased security in Britain comes after the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last week, after gunman Amedy Coulibaly took more than a dozen people hostage

Investigators across Europe are working around the clock to target returning Islamic State fighters.

The UK security services believe around 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the so-called jihad, with around half now back home. Counter-terror chiefs fear they may carry out ‘lone wolf’ attacks.

Professor Michael Clarke, director-general of the Royal United Services Institute, a defence think-tank, said the chance of marauding attacks by armed gunmen was ‘likely to increase’.

Last year 3,934 potential extremists were referred to a Government deradicalisation programme and 777 were assessed as such a danger that they needed to take part.
