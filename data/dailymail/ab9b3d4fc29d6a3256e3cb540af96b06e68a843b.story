Jailed: Builder Harry Rowbottom

A TAX-dodging builder who took 
cash-in-hand for his entire career told HMRC inspectors when they 
knocked on his door, ‘I’ve been waiting for you for 27 years.’

Harry Rowbottom, 58, worked as a 
self-employed builder, plumber and gas installer after setting up his 
own business in the early 1980s.

No job was too small... but he was always paid in cash, which he failed to declare to the taxman for a staggering 27 years.

Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs 
estimated he owed £117,602, made up of £64,674 in unpaid income tax and 
national insurance, plus interest.

However, the complete lack of 
paperwork and proof of the number of jobs he was paid for means the true
extent of his tax evasion may have been significantly higher.

When investigators knocked on his door
during routine inquiries to catch tax-dodging tradesmen, he immediately
admitted responsibility, and said: ‘I’ve been waiting for you for 27 
years.’

His lawyer said he was relieved finally to be caught.

Rowbottom was jailed for 14 months at 
Grimsby Crown Court this week after pleading guilty to fraud, and was 
ordered to pay his dues in full or face a longer term behind bars.

He 
was also ordered to pay £1,500 costs.

Gordon Stables, prosecuting, told the court he was caught by an HMRC campaign centred on self-assessment by plumbers.

The drive has already led to £4million in outstanding tax being paid back.

The court heard there was evidence of 
Rowbottom working around Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, where he 
lived with his partner, but bank accounts revealed that he apparently 
had no regular source of income.

He was arrested in November last year 
and admitted working for cash that was never paid into a bank account.

He also admitted not keeping proper records for a property he had owned 
since 2001. He also owned plots of land.

Judge Robert Moore told him: ‘For 27 years you paid no tax and national insurance.

‘You know the matter is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified.

‘Fortunately, the Revenue will get back the capital and interest.’

Richard Hackfath, defending, said Rowbottom had sufficient assets to pay in full and would do so as soon as possible.

Caught out: Gordon Stables, prosecuting, told Grimsby Crown Court that Rowbottom was caught as part of a campaign by Revenue and Customs targeting self-assessment by plumbers

Explaining the long-running fraud, he 
said: ‘He let matters ride. He was relieved to be caught and to be no 
longer listening for a knock on the door from Revenue and Customs.’

An HMRC spokesman said there was no 
evidence Rowbottom was living a lavish lifestyle and his was a classic 
case of ‘bury your head in the sand syndrome’.

She added: ‘A lot of people are paid 
in cash but it’s how they declare it that counts. As long as they put it
on their tax return they can get paid how they want.’
