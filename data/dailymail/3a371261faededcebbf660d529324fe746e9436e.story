A pair of Air Jordan 1s that were autographed by the basketball great himself once sold at auction for $60,000 - so Kanye West is a long way off entering the 'most expensive sneaker hall of fame'.

However, it took just 11 minutes for the hip hop mogul's special edition Nike sneakers to sell out on Sunday after a surprise release was announced by the shoe giant - and about the same time for them to start and be hawked on eBay.

The shoes, called the Air Yeezy II Red Octobers, retailed for $245.

They are now being offered online for as much as $7,500.

Special edition sneakers created for Nike by Kanye West - the Nike Air Yeezy 2 - sold out in 11 minutes on Sunday and quickly started being hawked on ebay for thousands of dollars

West has discussed and worn the kicks for the past year but they were hit with heavy delays.

However at exactly 1pm ET on Sunday, Nike Tweeted they had been made available online in a shock announcement.

By 1.11pm ET they were all gone.

It is unclear how many pairs of the shoes were actually sold.

But almost immediately they began popping on eBay - likely before anyone had physically received them, with the shoe only available online.

Sizes 8.5 and 13 were put up at $5,000.

A size 10.5 was advertised on the site for $3,750.

However a size 12 had the biggest asking price, with $7,500, making it a profit of $7,255.

In November 2013, Kanye West spoke about frustrations with Nike regarding the shoe's availability.

'They try to act like people ain't line up for the Yeezys,' Kanye West said, speaking about the sneaker's first installment.

'[Nike CEO] Mark Parker tried to son me. Yes. Son me because I am the sun and I will shine bright.

'And when I don't have as much money as a billionaire and when I don't have the factories that, that dude has over there, what I do have is my voice.

'Ain't no corporation that can take me away from my voice and I'm going to scream at the top of my motherfucking mountain as loud as I want.

The amount of time Kanye West has been wearing the shoes - since last May - has made the demand for them even greater

'Anything I want. Whenever I want.

'Is that crazy? So I'm going to make the announcement on Monday with the corporation that finally let me get an opportunity to create.'

The 'Red Octobers' first appeared on Kim Kardashian's Instagram last May.

West first wore them on Saturday Night Live not longer after, and continued to wear them throughout the year.
