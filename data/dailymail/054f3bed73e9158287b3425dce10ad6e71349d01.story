Torquay United players earn £375 per week on average, according to manager  Chris Hargreaves, meaning it would take them almost 16 years to match what Wayne Rooney makes in seven days.

The Conference club's average figure is £104 below the UK's average weekly earnings of £479 and is in stark contrast to the Manchester United captain, who is among the best paid in the Barclays Premier League on a reported £300,000 per week.

'I'm giving a reason why sometimes we might not be up there with the big boys,' Hargreaves told BBC Radio Devon. 'The average wage on Saturday was £375.

Working 40 hours a week on minimum wage (£6.50 an hour) gets you £260 

'You are not going to win a league on that unless you over-achieve miraculously.'

The comments came after Torquay reserve goalkeeper Jordan Seabright quit football to become a car salesman.

The club sit 15th in the Conference, but were expected to make a push for a return to the Football League this year. 

But Barnet currently top the table and sit 28 points ahead of Torquay.

'The average age is very young, the average wage is very low, and those two things combined make it a challenge,' Hargreaves continued.

'We took criticism and it was in most quarters right, and we had to put it right. I'm pleased for those that have stuck with us, and with me, and we want to give them exciting performances.'
