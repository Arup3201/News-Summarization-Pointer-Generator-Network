A legendary 83-year-old jewelry thief has been sent back to prison after her latest heist.

Doris Payne has gained a reputation for her knack of walking out of jewelry stores across the globe with million-dollar baubles and her latest theft shows that the octogenarian is still able to pull off a steal.

Unfortunately for Payne, authorities are so familiar with her history at this point that they were quick to catch her.

Paying for her crimes: Doris Payne has been caught a number of times (pictured here in 2005) for her jewelry thefts but it hasn't stopped her from continuing to walk out of stores with millions in diamonds

Last fall, she had just been released from prison three months earlier when she stole a $22,500 diamond and white gold ring from a Riverside, California jewelry store.

She got away with the theft by doing her typical move- trying on jewelry and chatting with the shop owner until they forget she is wearing it as she walks out.

Icon of sorts: Payne, now 83, has been the subject of a documentary and a movie about her life- rumored to be starring Halle Berry- is reportedly in the works

In this case, the Los Angeles Times reports that the manager of El Paseo Jewelers only realized that the ring was missing hours after she had gone.

She sold the ring to a nearby pawnshop for $800, and as part of the sale, she had to give her thumbprint, which eventually tipped off authorities.

Payne was sentenced today to spend two years in jail and two years under mandatory supervision.

'The judge tempered punishment with compassion about her age,' Payne's attorney Gretchen von Helms told the newspaper.

'He took into account the taxpayers' pocketbook. And do we really need to incarcerate a nonviolent offender- yes, a repeat offender, that's true- who's ill, who has emphysema, who's elderly?'

Payne has been working her cons for more than five decades and has been the subject of a documentary, titled 'The Life And Crimes Of Doris Payne'.

There is speculation that a biopic is in the works with Academy Award winner Halle Berry set to star as Payne.

In the documentary, Payne revealed how she first learned the distraction trick as a teenager when a store clerk eagerly ditched her when a white customer came into the store.

From there, she worked her way up from bargain jewelry to some expensive stores across the globe, with a heist in Monaco listed as one of her most storied accomplishments.

Over time, she has been connected to 20 aliases, nine dates of birth, and five Social Security numbers.

'There’s never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do,' she said in the documentary.

'I don’t have any regrets about stealing jewelry. I regret getting caught.'

That sentiment proves problematic for judges who she is put in front of.

In 2010, she asked the judge to be lenient because she was 'truly sorry that this went on as long as it did,' but that wasn't enough.

'You won't stop,' Judge Frank Brown said at the time, explaining his decision to sentence her to five years which was at the high end of the possible verdicts.

'That’s the problem here... She’s a thief. She’s charming. Santa Claus’s wife, that’s who she is.'
