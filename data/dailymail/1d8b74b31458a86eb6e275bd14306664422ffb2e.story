Charged: 17-year-old Tyler Hadley of Port St Lucie, Florida has been charged with first degree double homicide

A 17-year-old boy 'brutally and mercilessly' killed his parents before having a house party while their bodies were still inside a bedroom, police said.

Tyler Hadley, of Port St Lucie, Florida, allegedly beat his school teacher mother Mary-Jo and father Blake to death with a hammer, which was found lying between their bodies.

The teen is thought to have killed his parents before hosting a party for 40 to 60 people on Saturday night after posting invitations on Facebook.

The party started at around 9pm and went on until around 3am.

Police arrived at the ranch-style home the next day after an anonymous tip.

Hadley had been 'nervous and panicky,' they said and there were beer cans strewn all over the garden.

He initially told police his parents were out of town.

Police then found the bodies of Mr and Mrs Hadley in the master bedroom where the door had been locked.

They are believed to have died after the Facebook invitation went out, which happened at about 1:30 pm on Saturday, although the exact time of the brutal killing is unclear.

Their bodies were partially buried under various items including linen, books, picture frames and towels.

Mrs Hadley, 47, is believed to have been killed first and then Mr Hadley, 54, afterwards.

They were not, authorities believe, killed in the bedroom where their bodies were found.

While is not clear what the motive for 
the alleged killing was, a resident told WSVN News he had heard Hadley's
parents had refused to let the teen have a party.

Similarly one of the teens attending the party said to WOKV that the 17-year-old killed his parents because they 'wouldn't let him throw a party.'

The teen had dropped out of his high 
school and the family was being sued for $15,000 after Hadley hit and 
injured a child while driving a car registered to his father in June 
2010, according to court documents.

Hadley has been arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

He is being held without bond and will be charged as an adult, police said.

'I've known Mary-Jo since she was in high school in Fort Lauderdale,' family friend Charlene Moses told WPTV.

'They are a nice family. The kids are always nice.'

Tyler reportedly has an older brother who recently moved out the house.

Blake Hadley was an employee of Florida Power & Light Co. and wife Mary Jo worked for 24 years as an elementary school teacher with the St. Lucie County School District.
