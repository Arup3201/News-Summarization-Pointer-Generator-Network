Eight-year-old Dylan Williams, pictured, died of blunt force trauma after being hit on the head with a baseball

An eight-year-old schoolboy has died after being hit on the head by a baseball in front of his devastated father.

Dylan Williams, eight, was playing at a youth all-star game practice in Union City, Indianapolis, when he was knocked out by the nine-inch ball.

Dylan went into cardiac arrest and was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children where doctors battled to save his life on Tuesday.

He was pronounced brain dead at the hospital after brain was deprived of oxygen for 40 minutes and his parents decided to switch off his life support on Wednesday.

Dylan's father, Erick Williams, was coaching at the game and witnessed the moment his son was hit with a ball.

He told television station WHIO-TV: 'He was playing first base and they went to throw a ball to him and he wasn't really looking, and to me it looked like it hit him in the side of the neck and he just dropped to the ground.

'He was a great kid. Loved baseball, loved his teammates.'

Dylanâ€™s mother Georgiana Williams said other parents should 'hug and kiss your kids as much as possible' because you never know what might happen.

The coordinator of the all-star baseball team Michael Fulk said no decisions had been made about play for the rest of the season following Dylan's death.

An autopsy by the Marion County 
Coroner's office showed Dylan died from 'complications of blunt force 
trauma to the right side of his head and neck.

Union City Mayor Bryan Conklin told digtriad.com that Dylan's death has affected the whole Union City community which has a population of around 5,000.

The father-of-two said: 'It's probably one of the saddest things I've ever heard. For a kid to be playing something he likes to do, and then...it's just heart-breaking.'

Union City Police Chief Colbie Wells said they are still investigating the incident.

Youth baseball is considered a safe sport but a USA Baseball baseball study of players from children to young adults found 39 deaths among 82.6 million participants between 1989 and 2006, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.
