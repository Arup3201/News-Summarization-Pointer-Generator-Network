Disgraced former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers launched an attack on the media as he was charged with three drugs offences today.

Arriving at a police station to answer bail, he told the assembled reporters and photographers that they were ‘vultures’.

However, the man dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist’ said he would make an exception for the BBC – which had always been ‘really nice’ to him.

Anger: Flowers called waiting journalists 'vultures' but said the BBC had been 'very nice' since the scandal broke last year

Flowers was charged with three counts of possessing illegal drugs and will appear before magistrates next month.

He was arrested in November following newspaper allegations that he was involved in a drug deal.

But while criticising reporters in a bizarre outburst yesterday, he said: ‘There is a phrase for some people, they call them vultures, and I really do hope that somebody quotes me on that, especially the BBC.

‘The BBC have been really nice to me but the rest of you are vultures.’

Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, has been charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine.

He made no comment after leaving the police station at Stainbeck in Leeds.

Flowers, who has been attending an addiction treatment programme, turned up accompanied by two minders and carrying the book, Dazzling Darkness –– Gender, Sexuality, Illness and God.

Written by Rachel Mann, an Anglican parish priest, it is described as a ‘passionate and nuanced book’ bringing together ‘poetry, feminist theology, and  philosophy and exploring  them through one person’s hunger for wholeness, self-knowledge and God’.

Flowers’s solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a ‘full statement’ following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7.

Mr Hollas also took the opportunity to criticise the media.

He said his client had been ‘hounded for six months by certain elements of the Press’ and many allegations were ‘completely without foundation’.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had ‘carefully considered’ a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges.

Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs.

He had stepped down from his position at the Co-op last June, but publicity about his alleged drug habit prompted questions about how he was deemed suitable to run a bank.

It also emerged that he quit as a Labour councillor in Bradford after porn was found on his computer, although at the time he claimed he was leaving because of the pressure of work.

The Co-operative Bank confirmed last year it was seeking  to recover payments totalling £31,000 made to Flowers amid reports that he was also the subject of an inquiry into ‘lavish’ expenses claims when he resigned.

While on bail last month, Flowers gave an interview to the BBC about the furore and admitted he had ‘sinned’.

He said: ‘I am in company with every other human being for having my frailties and some fragility exposed. Most people get through life without that ever coming into the public domain.’

He described the months since his arrest as ‘hellish’ at times.

A second man, Gavin Woroniuk, has been charged with four offences of offering to supply a controlled drug and possession of criminal property.
