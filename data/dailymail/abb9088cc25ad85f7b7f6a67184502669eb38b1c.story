Strictly Come Dancing champion Natasha Kaplinsky is branching out – by building a giant tree house in her back garden.

The veteran newsreader, 41, is seeking planning permission to build a play area complete with a slide, monkey bars and swings that will transform part of her property into an adventure land.

It’s something her children are bound to take delight in.

Ms Kaplinsky is proposing the build the giant wooden play house in a tree at the edge of the 15-century farmhouse she shares with husband Justin Bower and children in East Sussex.

It’s not known which company will be 
building the treehouse, but it might look something like the one in the 
picture below if she opts for the services of bespoke East Sussex 
treehouse maker Blue Forest.

Kaplinsky, who won the first ever series of the popular dancing show in 2004, is thought to have bought the million-pound property with her husband last year.

The split-level tree house, which also contains a covered 'play room', is estimated as being 17ft wide and 38ft long.

As with all planning applications, neighbours can object. Luckily, Ms Kaplinsky lives in such a rural area that the structure will simply blend in.

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I'm stunned, the plans look massive.

‘It's very rural here so I don't think anybody would have any objections if she wanted to turn her back garden into an adventure land. I certainly don't mind.’

According to plans lodged with her local council the structure is an ‘elevated playhouse in garden, to be built around existing tree with wooden decking and rope bridge’.

Residents have three weeks to attempt to block the construction, if they feel their privacy or lives will be adversely affected.
