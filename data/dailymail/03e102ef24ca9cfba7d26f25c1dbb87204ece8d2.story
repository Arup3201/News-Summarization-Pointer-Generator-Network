Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel reignited their feud during Chelsea’s lunchtime showdown at Liverpool.

The  pair first clashed during Slovakia’s surprise victory against Spain in their Euro 2016 qualifier in October; the Liverpool defender later revealing that former team-mate Luis Suarez taught him expletive words to taunt Costa.

And the duo had to be separated as the teams came off at half-time on Saturday with Liverpool and Chelsea drawing 1-1. Players from both sides got involved with Costa seemingly unhappy with his opponent.

Costa appeared to be unhappy with Liverpool defender Skrtel as the teams left the field of play at Anfield 

The pair had collided on two occasions in the first half of the Premier League showdown at Anfield with Costa fortunate not to find his name in the referee’s notebook after forcibly barging into the back of the Slovakian.

Later, Costa appeared to haul Skrtel to the floor after the Liverpool defender won an aerial battle.

But the Spain striker then had the last laugh when he scored the game's decisive goal, moments after he was forced to replace a ripped shirt.

Costa and Skrtel came to blows throughout Spain and Slovakia's Group C fixture in October and could be seen barging into each other as well as sharing an exchange in the penalty area.

Earlier, Costa had to change his top after he obtained a rip in the back of his shirt during the second half

However, on that occasion Skrtel was on the winning side as former Chelsea youngster Miroslav Stoch scored an 87th minute winner to give Slovakia the victory.

Skrtel revealed afterwards that he received a congratulatory message from Suarez. 

Speaking to The Express, Skrtel said: 'I wrote back thanking him for the rude words he'd taught me which I could use against Diego Costa.'

Suarez spent two-and-a-half seasons at Anfield with Skrtel before moving to Barcelona in a £75million deal in July.
