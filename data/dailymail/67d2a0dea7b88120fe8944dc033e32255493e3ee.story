A toddler is presumed to have died after he was swept into an underground sewage system when a road collapsed due to a ruptured water pipe yesterday.

The 18-month-old child's mother was pushing him in his buggy through the Russian city of Bryansck when the ground at a crossroads opened up beneath them.

The boy and his mother, a 26-year-old policeman's wife, plunged into the sewer.

Tragedy: A toddler died yesterday after a road in the Russian city of Bryansck collapsed, throwing him into an underground collecting tank for a sewage system

The woman was rescued, but the child was thrown from his pushchair and swept away by the current into a collecting tank for the sewage system.

He is today presumed dead.

While the woman did not sustain any serious injuries, she was rushed to intensive care in a state of severe shock.

Investigators say they are working to determine the cause of the accident, but suspect faulty construction of the system may be to blame.

Underground pipes carrying hot water occasionally burst in Russia, causing the ground above them to suddenly collapse to the peril of those walking above.

A criminal case has been opened into the death of the child.
