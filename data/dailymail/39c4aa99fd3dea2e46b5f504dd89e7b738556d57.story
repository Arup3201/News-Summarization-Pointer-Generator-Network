When filmmaker Heidi Lee Douglas travelled to Tasmania in 2001 to document the struggle between the controversial logging industry and the local community, she never expected that her footage would be used to take her, and 19 others, to court.

Heidi was asked to come on board as the in-house filmmaker for advocacy group The Wilderness Society, and continued her own independent filming, capturing the broader environmental issues facing Tasmania at the time.

Faced with backlash from the local community, logging corporation Gunns Limited sued Heidi and 19 other activists known as 'the Gunns 20', including lawyers, campaigners, elected politicians, students, doctors, a writer, and a dentist, on charges of conspiracy to undermine their company's image.

Heidi spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the documentary, Defendant 5, which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life

While the charges were thrown out of court two times before a third and final attempt by woodchipping industry giant Gunns failed, which contributed to the collapse of their company, Heidi described the whole experience as intense and quite traumatic.

Having become involved in telling the story of the logging industry's impact on the state as an individual, she found herself swept up in a much larger issue between Gunns and the local community.

In Heidi's documentary about the experience, she said, 'My life was changing and I had no control over it anymore… I was a player in this massive chess game between this almighty powerful corporation and really, a bunch of community members who’d been standing up for their backyards.'

Heidi spoke to Daily Mail Australia about the documentary, Defendant 5, which details her involvement in the legal process and the impact it had on her life.

'The whole process of filming and editing was intense. It made me relive what had happened, and lots of moments I wondered why I was doing it, there was some awful memories dredged up,' Heidi said.

Heidi released footage of the company dropping a napalm-like substance on the remainder of a wood-felling site and burning the area 

'The uprising was coming from middle class, mainstream communities. It wasn’t extremists as other people might say, it was a widespread community conflict,' said Heidi

Being both a filmmaker and a defendant, Heidi was in a unique position to explain the ordeal, and felt that the issues that had plagued Tasmania and the wider Australian public remained relevant today.

'When I went to university I was exposed to documentary film making, and I felt like it was what I wanted to do. I became very passionate about telling underdog stories, human rights stories, ones that you don’t see a lot of in the mainstream media,' she said. 

'I already had an interest in this and had covered issues in East Timor and South Australia and had visited other forest campaigners to learn what they were doing, and in Tasmania in particular I heard about a real uprising.'

'It was coming from middle class, mainstream communities. It wasn’t extremists as other people might say, it was a widespread community conflict.' 

During legal proceedings, Heidi realised that her documentary footage was one of the ties between the defendants, who were an otherwise disparate group.

'I never expected for the prosecution to use my footage as evidence to prove a conspiracy. I was devastated because I thought I’d been doing something to help wider community,' Heidi said.

'I realised during the legal process that there was no constitutional protection of free speech. I thought we had free speech protection, like in the US, but after doing some more research I discovered that we didn't, which still concerns me,' she said. 

'There was no legal precedent for a case like this, where Gunns were re-framing a campaign to raise public awareness as a conspiracy. There's no real protection for whistleblowers, whether that be journalists or filmmakers.'

Heidi felt incredibly isolated throughout the trial, and began a series of confessional video diaries as a form of releasing the pent up anguish and anxiety she was feeling.

'It's really hard when you're the one being persecuted because as an individual you don't have the resources and protection that the corporate giants do, and while you're being sued you can't speak out.'

'I was all alone, and it stopped me from doing what I'd been doing for five years. Even now my life is still absorbed by the impact of it.' 

Heidi felt as though she had been gagged, silenced, and without a voice, unable to interact with the world through film as she had for so long.

It was because of this sense of disempowerment  that made the creation of Defendant 5 very healing, because even though it was painful at times to make, it gave her back her agency.

'What people will see when they watch the documentary is a deeply personal story of how it feels to be targeted by a giant corporation and to be denied freedom of speech,' she said.

Heidi released a film showing images of the company dropping a napalm-like substance on the remainder of a wood-felling site and burning the area.

As major Australian banks withdrew support from the company's industrial plans, Gunns Limited was unable to source financial backing from overseas after pressure from environmental agencies, and folded as a company.

The documentary will air next week, coinciding with the ten-year anniversary of the defendant's receiving the first legal document regarding the case

During legal proceedings, Heidi realised that her documentary footage was what tied all the defendants, who were an otherwise disparate group, together

They really shot themselves in the foot with their behaviour, because it was not just an environmental issue, it was now a human rights issue. They drew more attention to themselves through their bullish behaviour and ended up in collapse,' said Heidi. 

Heidi said that she hopes people will understand that activism isn't the dirty word many think it is, and she wants her film to be part of breaking down misconceptions about what it means to have a sense of social responsibility. 

'We all should have social responsibility, to each other and the world we live in. Being an activist doesn't make you an extremist, it just means you're someone who cares,' Heidi said. 

The documentary will air next week, coinciding with the ten-year anniversary of the defendant's receiving the first legal document regarding the case.

'Our democratic rights are very tenuous and we can't take them for granted. If we value having a fair and just Australian society then we need to partake and protect our democratic rights,' she said. 

'20 people were sued and the other defendants were able to walk away, and I totally understand why, but I can't just walk away. I need to tell this story.'

Defendant 5 is screening as part of the Opening Shot series of documentaries by up and coming Australian filmmakers.

It will air on Monday, December 8 at 9.30pm on ABC2 and will then be available to view on ABC iview.
