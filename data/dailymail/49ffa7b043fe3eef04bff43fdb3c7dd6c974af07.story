An engaged, pregnant mother has claimed she was fired by her Baptist Church employer because she was not married.

Apryl Kellam, 21, had been employed at the daycare center at Staples Mill Road Baptist Church in Henrico County, Virginia since September.

However Miss Kellam, who lives with her fiancé, James, her five-year-old stepdaughter and two-year-old daughter, lost her job on Monday for 'violating policies'. 

Mother Apryl Kellam, pictured with her fiancé James, claims she was fired from her job at a Baptist church daycare center because she was living out of wedlock 

Miss Kellam, pictured with her daughter  alleged that the employee handbook tells workers they need to be married in order to work in the daycare center but that she did not sign the document.

Details of why she was fired were not explained to Miss Kellam but she told Daily Mail Online today that she believed it was because of her living situation about which she had been repeatedly questioned by her daycare boss. 

She said: 'I was told, ''you are not Christian if you decide to keep taking your life this way.''' 

The 21-year-old was employed as a 'floater teacher' at the daycare in September. She said that on her resume it stated that most of her experience for the job came because she had her own children. 

When asked to fill out a form of employee details, she then ticked the 'single' box, stating she lived with the girls and her fiancé. 

After she got the job, Miss Kellam said she was shown an employee handbook by co-workers which said she needed to be married in order to work in the daycare center. However she did not receive the handbook on getting the job, nor had she signed it. 

Miss Kellam found out in November that she was expecting another baby and told her boss who   realized she was not married.

'She wanted us to go to the court so we could have the marriage certificate on file,' Miss Kellam said. 

At her review last Thursday, her employer praised her work but once again raised the problem of Miss Kellam not being married. The boss said that if she didn't set a date to get married by Monday. she would be out of a job.

The Staples Mill Road Baptist Church in Virginia fired an employee for 'violating policies' on Monday - but she suspects it is because she is pregnant and living with her partner out of wedlock

Pastor Jim Booth would not comment on specific employee matters on Monday but added that the church 'do not have any policies against single mothers'

The pregnant mother was fired today for as yet undisclosed reasons. 

The mom, who is 25 weeks pregnant, admitted that having to live off only her fiancé's pay check would be 'stressful', but she was hoping to get another job soon.

The church's pastor, Jim Booth, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that he could respond to a specific personnel matter.

However he said that the church 'certainly do not have any policies against single mothers. We have a number of single women and single mothers employed and faithfully serving in our ministry'.

He added: 'Due to personnel confidentiality I am not able to share the specific cause for the termination of an employee.'  

Although the federal Family and Medical Leave Act prevents pregnant women being discriminated against, the Supreme Court has ruled that religious organizations can enforce a religious contract on its employees.
