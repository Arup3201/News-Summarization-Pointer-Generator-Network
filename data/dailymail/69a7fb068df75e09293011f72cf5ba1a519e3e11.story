A Marine from New York narrowly escaped with his life after bitten by a rattlesnake while on a hike with two friends in Oklahoma.

Anthony Kemp, 23, ended up losing half of his leg as a result of the incident that happened during the first week of February.

2nd Lt. Kemp was bitten on his left calf during his hike in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge near Fort Sill.

Close call: A large rattlesnake bit 2nd Lt. Anthony Kemp, 23, almost killing him. His leg was later amputated

Manic: Once back down the hill, they were met with a wildlife officer and AMT who quickly transported Kemp to an open field to be flown to OU Medical. His leg was later amputated

No laughing matter: After being bitten Kemp said he became nauseated, his leg swelled and his heart began to pound. He thought he might not survive

The three men had just completed a tough week of testing and wanted to get out and enjoy the terrain in the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, a 59,000-acre expanse adjacent to Fort Sill and maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Kemp, who was training to be an artillery officer heard a noise in the brush, and then within an instant, searing pain as the snake pushed its fangs into his leg.

His fellow Marines rushed to his aid, one helping him to stand while the other dialed 911.

Their only way out was on foot, walking across the top of a nearby dam to avoid another descent into the steep valley.

Kemp credits his two friends, also second lieutenants, for saving his life as they helped get him to a hospital.

'One of the last things I remember is as soon as the sheriff laid me down, I looked at my buddy and told him to text my mom and tell her I love her,' Kemp said to NewsOk. 

'My friends were very comforting the entire time,' Kemp said. 'If it wasn't for them, I definitely would have been dead.'

'I'm good. A little lighter, but I'm good,' he said in a phonecall to NBC News from OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City. 'I'm trying my best to stay positive about the entire thing.' 

The snake bike went deep beneath skin filling Kemp's lower leg with venom.

2nd Lt. Taylor Quackenbush and 2nd Lt. Matthew Holliday helped on the day of the accident and have continued to visit him during his recovery. 

Training day: The day started out as a day of celebration for Kemp and his buddies, Matthew Holliday and Taylor Quackenbush, part of a small class of Marines training at Fort Sill to become artillery officers

The rescuers: 2nd Lieutenant Taylor Quackenbush (right) and 2nd Lieutenant Matthew Holliday (left) said they were just hiking up a hill at the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge when their friend was bitten

Attacker: They estimated the snake to be between six and eight feet long. 2nd Lieutenant Quackenbush called 911 while 2nd Lieutenant Holliday tried to help Kemp walk nearly 25 minutes back down the hill

Looking out: His buddies have visited him since the incident and in between his surgeries. They say his is still his normal self

Close call: Venomous snakebites are deadly because the poison eats up blood platelets; clots will not form. A snakebite victim risks internal bleeding that can lead to death

The poison damaged the flesh so much that doctors had to amputate his leg above the knee. 

He also received 32 doses of antivenin, an antidote to the snake venom.

Venomous snakebites are deadly because the poison eats up blood platelets; clots will not form. A snakebite victim risks internal bleeding that can lead to death.

Swelling also can interfere with blood supply to a limb, sometimes necessitating amputations, Schaeffer said.

Several weeks on from the traumatic incident, Kemp, who is from Glen Cove on Long Island, is now in stable condition and only recently emerged from a days-long haze. 

It's a long road to recovery however. After leaving hospital he will begin rehabilitation at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. 

He is hoping that the loss of his leg does not mean the loss of his career.

'I'm not getting out just yet,' Kemp said. 'We'll see about career options and stuff. I'll take it one day at a time.' 

'I was, again, very fortunate my friends were there and were able to not only keep me moving, kind of keep my head in the game,' Kemp said. 'They very much saved my life.'

Well liked: Kemp is still due for a few more surgeries. One of the Facebook pages 'Cards for Kemp' is asking people to send cards to him as he goes through this journey

Saved: The Marines say their training of thinking fast and staying calm kicked in
