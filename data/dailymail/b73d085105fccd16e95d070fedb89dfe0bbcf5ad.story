They are rather new to the game, but the parenting styles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are already attracting attention.

William and Kate first broke with royal tradition by not hiring a full time nanny to help with child care, then William chose to drive his son home from the hospital rather than rely on a family chauffeur, and now in his first interview since the birth of George Prince William has admitted he wants to be a hands on father.

William's admission indicates that he may already be favouring 'terrier' tactics, one of three behavioural types identified by new reseach.

Will William be a 'terrier' dad- closely involved with his son and joining in his games and activities?

Childcare expert, Denise Robertson, reveals there are three main types of parent, which can each be represented by an animal; terrier, lion and penguin.

‘Terrier’ parents, which Wills and Kate seem to be lining up to be, want to be highly involved in their child’s life.

A quarter of parents polled in the research (24 per cent) want to squeeze in as much time with their children as they can and try to get involved as much as possible.

Terrier fathers  are seen as big kids with 30 per cent of terriers getting involved with everything their child does and 26 per cent take up a hobby just because their child likes it.

William may try and recreate his happy early childhood within the walls of  the royal palaces with his son, as almost a third of fathers (30 per cent) report playing the same games as they did as a child because they want their child to have the same upbringing.

For some mothers and fathers getting involved in their child’s life is as much because they want to keep them entertained as for the benefits of hands on parenting – almost half of parents (45 per cent) worry their child will be bored during the holidays.

‘Lion’ parents however, take a very different approach to raising their children.

Much like the lion, these parents believe independence is key and that sometimes kids just need time with their own imagination.

One in ten parents polled agree and take a hands off approach to childcare, leaving the kids to their own devices with 41 per cent admitting that looking after the children can be tiring so by giving them some time to play on their own not only gives busy parents time to rest, but also helps them improve their creativity.

The third parenting type identified by the research by Capri Sun and Denise is 'Penguin' parenting, where parents share responsibilities to look after the children.

Childcare can often be a bit of a balancing act for busy working parents and 34 per cent say they struggle to get time off work, while over a fifth (21 per cent) say finding childcare is difficult.

Spending time with your kids is 
important for all parents so when it comes to looking after their 
children, Penguin parents want someone close to home to look after the 
little ones.

A quarter rely on family and friends and topping the list is grandparents (57 per cent) and neighbours (11 per cent).

While it may be tempting to try and fit yourself into the mould of one these three animal definitions of parenting, founder of mumsnet Justine Roberts warns that it isn’t necessarily helpful.

‘Mothers are, sadly, used to being criticised for their parenting techniques whatever they do, whether it's being a stay-at-home-mum, working mum, getting involved or being hands-off.

‘It seems that Terrier, Lion and Penguin parenting are new labels to replace Tiger Mums, helicopter parents and the rest. 

‘Parents broadly share only a couple of common characteristics - that they're doing their best and are knackered most of the time,’ Jane says.
