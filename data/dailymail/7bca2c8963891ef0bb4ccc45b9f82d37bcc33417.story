New recipe: Sprite is to be reformulated with a 'natural' sweetener so it contains 30 per cent fewer calories

The fizzy drink Sprite is to be scrapped as we know it in favour of a lower-calorie version that uses a 'natural' sweetener.

The new formulation of the popular beverage will contain 30 per cent fewer calories - but fans fear it will have an unusual aftertaste.

The drink is being altered as part of the parent company Coca-Cola's anti-obesity drive and follows a call by the government to address the issue.

The company is airing its first anti-obesity TV ad in the UK tonight.

In a statement today, Coca-Cola confirmed the launch of 'a new, reduced-calorie Sprite in the UK from March 2013'.

'We are introducing
Sprite with Stevia in the UK. This will contain 30 per cent fewer 
calories and, instead of being added as a mid-calorie addition to the 
Sprite range, it will completely replace the current Sprite,' it read.

'Stevia, a sweetener from natural 
origins, is sweeter than sugar but without the calories.

'It is an 
extract from the leaf of the stevia plant which is native to Paraguay. 
Stevia has been used for centuries as a source of intense, natural 
sweetness.'

The herbal sweetener, Stevia, is already available in the French version of Sprite.

A plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large 
companies such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years.

First introduced in 1961, Sprite is now sold in 190 countries. The lemon and lime drink contains 65 calories and 15.9g of sugar in each 150ml can.

The name came from the ‘Sprite Boy’ character that had been used to advertise Coca-Cola in the 1940s and 1950s.

It was launched to compete against 7UP that had first been formulated in 1929 by Charles Leiper Grigg.

The Sprite slogan 'Obey Your Thirst' was launched in 1994.

Sprite is the UK's seventh-biggest-selling carbonated soft drink. In 2009, its UK sales were £63.1m - almost double that of 7UP.

Encouraged by a growing distrust of artificial sweeteners and an increased demand for natural products, they have turned to the plant extract that is up to 300 times sweeter than traditional beet or cane sugar.

However, critics say it has a very strong aftertaste - it is often compared to liquorice - and it is far more expensive  than other widely-used artificial sweeteners including aspartame, saccharin and sucralose.

Coca-Cola's anti-obesity TV ads have been airing in the U.S since January (see video below) and a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the ad will roll out to other countries throughout the year.

The two-minute clip, titled 'Coming Together', 'reminds' viewers that all calories count in
managing weight, including those in Coca-Cola's products.

It
will be followed by a second ad later in the evening which will tell 
viewers how much physical activity they would have to do to burn those 
calories up.

The ad touts Coca-Cola's record of selling drinks with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind and not just fizzy drinks.

Coca-Cola says its latest marketing campaign will kick off a variety of moves that help address obesity in the upcoming year, such as providing more diet options.

Diet drinks already make up nearly half of Coca-Cola's UK sales, with Diet Coke and Coke Zero accounting for 45 per cent of sales.

The company also says that since 2007, it has reduced the calorie content of Fanta Orange by 30 per cent, Oasis by 35 per cent and Lilt by 56 per cent.

It also plans to 'reduce the average calories per litre of our range of sparkling soft drinks by five per cent by the end of 2014'.

The company is still exploring whether to bring the Sprite with stevia to the U.S.

James Quincey, President of The Coca-Cola Company's Europe group, said: 'Obesity is a serious problem and I am 
determined we will take more actions in Europe to help address it. The 
actions announced today build on our earlier efforts and are part of a 
long-term commitment.'
