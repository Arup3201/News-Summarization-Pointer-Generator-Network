Six weeks after New Zealand and Australia kicked off the 2015 Cricket World Cup on Valentine's Day with explosive wins, the two co-hosts will go head to head in what promises to be a spectacular finale at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The two sides met during the group stage, and it was New Zealand who prevailed that day with a thrilling one-wicket victory in Auckland when Kane Williamson swatted Pat Cummins for a six to the delight of the Eden Park crowd.

Ahead of Sunday's trans-Tasman final in Melbourne, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about both teams.

AUSTRALIA 

Captain – Michael Clarke

The 33-year-old has not hit top form with the bat during the tournament but showed his versatility against India, shuffling with the batting line-up to bring in the big hitters with his side in a commanding position.

Clarke missed the opening match of the tournament against England as he recovered from a hamstring injury, but is hungry to add World Cup glory to his CV as Australian captain.

Star man – Steve Smith

Having become just the second Australian batsman to make four consecutive World Cup half-centuries after David Boon, Smith finally went on to make a century against India in the semi-final and heads to Melbourne in sparkling form.

Smith has spent pretty much all summer raising his bat to the crowd, scoring centuries in all four Test matches against India as well as ODI tons against South Africa in November and England in January.

Group A - beat England by 111 runs

Group A - no result vs Bangladesh

Group A - lost to New Zealand by one wicket

Group A - beat Afghanistan by 275 runs

Group A - beat Sri Lanka by 64 runs

Group A - beat Scotland by seven wickets

QF- beat Pakistan by six wickets

SF - beat India by 95 runs

Biggest disappointment  – David Warner

Aside from hitting a remarkable 178 against Afghanistan, Australia’s ‘bad boy’ has failed to fire at the top of the order with his next highest score during the World Cup a paltry 34 (v New Zealand). Fortunately for Warner, Australia's formidable middle and lower order have been imperious, in particular Smith.

Reason to be cheerful

Australia are the most successful side in World Cup history having been crowned champions in 1987, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Victory on Sunday would be a fifth title and a third in the last four editions of the tournament.

Reason to be fearful

Australia have looked mighty impressive on their route to the final, but there was one blemish on their record - a defeat by Sunday's opponents New Zealand in the group stages. Though the four-time world champions boast a fearsome batting line-up they are susceptible to the swinging ball, as Tim Southee and Trent Boult proved on that day in Auckland.

Omens

Australia have won eight of their last nine matches at the MCG since January 2011 with at least one of their top-five have scored a century in the winning causes, apart from when Aaron Finch fell for 96 against India this January.  

NEW ZEALAND

Captain – Brendon McCullum

McCullum’s attacking brand of captaincy on the field and aggressive batting when opening the innings have led many to label the 33-year-old as the best one-day captain currently playing.

Group A - beat Australia by one wicket

Group A - beat Afghanistan by six wickets

Group A - beat Bangladesh by three wickets

QF - beat West Indies by 143 runs

SF - beat South Africa by four wickets 

Star man – Daniel Vettori

While  Boult has swung himself to the leading wicket-taker of the tournament thus far, 36-year-old Vettori has taken 15 vital scalps and is set to play his final one-day international on Sunday in Melbourne.

Biggest disappointment – Ross Taylor

The right-handed batsman came into the tournament under pressure and, apart from a half-century against Bangladesh, Taylor has failed to make any substantial impact on the World Cup.

Reason to be cheerful

New Zealand have advanced to the final with a perfect record having already beaten Australia in the group stages. Sunday's match marks their first World Cup final having previously reached the semis on six separate occasions and will collect the ICC's £2.68million winning prize if they win in Melbourne.

Reason to be fearful

The co-hosts have yet to play a match outside of their country in this World Cup and haven’t beaten their opponents in Australia since February 2009 – when they claimed a six-wicket victory at the MCG. 

Will Boult and Southee be able to swing the ball in Melbourne as they have done in home conditions? And how will McCullum fare with the considerably larger boundaries at the MCG than the ones in New Zealand?

Omens

The MCG is not a happy hunting ground for the Black Caps. They have lost 11 of the 16 matches at 100,000-capacity stadium, with one no-result.

MELBOURNE CRICKET GROUND

The MCG is one of the finest sporting venues in the world and boasts a capacity of almost 100,000 spectators. The iconic ground was opened in 1854 and is located in Yarra Park, just a short walk from Melbourne's vibrant city centre.

Often affectionately referred to by locals simply as 'The G', the stadium hosted the 1992 World Cup final when Pakistan beat England and also hosts the annual Boxing Day Test match, which can attract huge crowds in excess of 90,000.

Away from cricket, the MCG was the lynchpin of the 1956 Olympic Games and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Nowadays, the venue is home to a number of Aussie Rules teams in the city with multiple matches being played at the stadium every match weekend and also hosts the annual AFL Grand Final.

With the annual Australian Grand Prix and the Australian Open tennis in town as well, it's no wonder that Melbourne is the sporting capital of down under.
