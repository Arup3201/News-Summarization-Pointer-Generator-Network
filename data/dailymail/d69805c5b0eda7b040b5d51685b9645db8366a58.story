Up to 100 people, including civilians and pro-Russian fighters, have been killed during a 24-hour bloodbath in the eastern Ukraine city of Donetsk.

Dozens of militants were reported dead in a furious battle for control of the airport in the key city of Donetsk where bodies were lying in the streets.

Pro-Moscow rebels said they may have up to 100 dead as morgues in the city struggled to cope with the shocking death toll. Other estimates put the death toll at closer to 50.

Violence erupted on Monday when rebels moved to seize the city airport and were repelled by Ukraine forces which used combat jets and helicopter gunships.

It came as the Kiev government sought to wipe out pro-Russian insurgents amid claims of Stalinist-style executions of rebel deserters.

In chilling scenes, there were claims several rebel commanders had been 'sentenced to death by shooting' with notices saying the 'executions' were conducted under a law enacted by Stalin's Supreme Soviet during the Second World War.

An order from the separatist militia in Donetsk claimed that 'commanders' Dmitry Slavov and Nikolay Lukyanov had been executed by a shot to the head.

Two other officers of Gorkovka police were also 'shot dead in front of all other policemen for betraying Donetsk Republic', it was reported.

The orders to execute were signed by Igor Strelkov, real surname Girkin, who is claimed by the Ukrainians to be a Russian career intelligence officer.

The rebel commanders were accused of "abandonment of combat positions" under a Stalin law dated 22 June 1941.

Journalists witnessed sustained intensive gun fire throughout the day and into the night. Plumes of black smoke rose in the air.

Officials closed the airport, and police shut nearby streets for traffic.

'From
 our side, there are more than 50 (dead),' the prime minister of the 
rebels' self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, told 
reporters from hospital.'

Another official Denis Pushilin said the figure was likely to reach 100, half of them civilians, with dozens more wounded.

Deputy
 premier Vitaly Yarema said the 'anti-terrorist operation' in eastern 
Ukraine will go on 'until all the militants are annihilated.'

Ukraine used air strikes and a 
paratrooper assault on Monday to clear rebels from Donetsk's 
international airport and had pushed the separatists out of the complex 
by the end of the day.

'The
 (separatist) fighters who had been in the terminal have been 
eliminated,' a spokesman for the government's 'anti-terrorist operation'
 said, indicating the airport was now under control of government 
forces.

But shooting continued through the night and by mid-morning machine gun fire could be heard on one of the main roads leading to the airport.

On Tuesday, Arsen Avakov, the interior minsiter, said the airport was 'completely under control', adding 'The adversary suffered heavy losses. We have no losses.'

But it was plain that Kiev was struggling for control despite a heavy use of force.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said it had lost contact with a four-member team in Donetsk after they were held at a checkpoint.

Miners went on strike against the military operation by the Kiev authorities, while in the war zone of Slavyansk there were calls to evacuate children from the carnage.

But Vitaly Yarema, the first deputy 
prime minister, added: 'We'll continue the anti-terrorist operation 
until not a single terrorist remains on the territory of Ukraine.'

In the city itself, a four-storey hockey stadium was set ablaze, though firefighters now have the blaze under control.

A Kamaz truck of the type rebels use to ferry their fighters was wrecked on the airport road, covered in blood and completely riddled with bullet holes.

Blood had spattered across the entire roadway and even reached a billboard seven metres above.

Outside the city centre, another Kamaz was flipped over, its deck covered in blood.

The Kremlin said today that President
 Vladimir Putin called for an end to the military campaign and for 
dialogue between Kiev and the separatists. Mr Putin was speaking in a 
telephone call with Italy's prime minister, his first reported comments 
on Ukraine since Sunday's election.

The battle came just as billionaire candy magnate Petro Poroshenko claimed victory in Sunday's presidential vote.

Poroshenko
 has vowed to negotiate a peaceful end to an insurgency in the east, 
where rebels have seized government offices and fought Ukrainian troops 
for more than a month.

Yet 
Poroshenko described the separatists as 'Somali pirates,' saying that 
arms should be used against 'killers and terrorists,' but he also 
indicated that he wants a quick end to the military operation in the 
east.

'The anti-terrorist operation cannot and should not last two or three months,' he said.

'It should and will last hours.'

Poroshenko, known for his pragmatism, supports building strong ties with Europe but also has stressed the importance of mending relations with Moscow.

Upon claiming victory, he said his first step as president would be to visit the east.

He said he hoped Russia would support his efforts to bring stability and that he wanted to hold talks with Moscow.

Russia welcomed his intention to engage in talks with people in the east and said it would be ready to work with Poroshenko.

Russia has denied accusations by the Ukrainian interim government and the West that it has fomented the insurgency in the east.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has stonewalled the insurgents' appeal to join Russia and welcomed the Ukrainian presidential election in an apparent bid to de-escalate tensions with the West, which has plunged to a post-Cold War low after Russia's annexation of Crimea.

But Russia has kept pushing for Ukraine to decentralize its government, which would give more power to regions, including those in the east, and wants Kiev to withdraw its troops from the area.
