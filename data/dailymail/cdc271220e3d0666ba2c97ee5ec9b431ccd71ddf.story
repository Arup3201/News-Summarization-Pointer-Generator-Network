A Swedish man was left with part of a glass bottle inside his cheek for over two weeks after several doctors failed to spot it.

Patrik Moberg, 23, was glassed in the face during a brawl on a one-day cruise to Finland, and was sewed up on the boat.

Back in Sweden, his wound kept bleeding, and it took five hospital visits before a doctor found that the entire bottom of the glass bottle was still embedded inside his cheek.

Medical malpractice: Patrik Moberg had this piece of glass in his face for 17 days after four doctors missed it

Mr Moberg was celebrating a friend’s birthday with a cruise to Åbo in Finland when a man pushed him outside the club.

‘I was in the corridor when he walked into my shoulder. When I told him “that was unnecessary” he came at me again and smashed me in the face with a bottle,’ he told Aftonbladet.

The onboard medic stiched up the wound, but somehow missed the large piece of class in his cheek.

When the boat returned to shore, Mr Moberg wanted to report the assault, and visited Linköping University Hospital.

He says he told staff he felt something hard in his cheek, but doctors did not x-ray his face, and instead settled with taking pictures for a potential trial.

He was told to let the wound heal, but several days later the stitches did not stop bleeding and Mr Moberg had to change his bandaging throughout the day.

He visited doctor number three, at a local care centre, but still no x-ray was carried out. Instead they examined the wound and determined that the ‘hard part’ underneath Mr Moberg’s skin was coagulated blood, and gave him penicillin for the healing process.

‘I started wondering if maybe they had forgotten a part of the bottle, but also thought it would have been unlikely that they could have missed such a big thing inside my cheek,’ Mr Moberg says.

Almost two-and-a-half weeks later, he returned to the local care centre to have his stitches removed, and finally did medical staff got suspicious.

He was sent to A&E where doctor number five was shocked to discover the large piece of glass.

Despite 17 days in pain with a bleeding wound and the glass in his cheek, Mr Moberg remains surprisingly calm about his ordeal.

‘What’s done is done, and it is most likely people who have had it worse than me’
