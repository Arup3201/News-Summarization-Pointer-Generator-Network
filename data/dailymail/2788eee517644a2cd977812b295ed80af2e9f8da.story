When you want to buy something - a lunch, a shirt or a plane ticket - you can usually find the price of the item on a menu, tag or online listing. It's not as easy when it comes to health care.

The truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $4,000 to as much as $14,000, depending on the city, according to new data compiled by Gawker. 

Using data from HealthSparq, the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in Washington, DC; New York City; Miami; Houston; Los Angeles and San Francisco. 

Random: New data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the U.S. Above, the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $10,000 

Common procedure: The cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $14,000 in most cities, but is a steal in Washington DC at $9,000 

The results will certainly have Houston residents driving to Los Angeles if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure. 

A carpal tunnel release procedure at a surgical center in Houston costs upwards of $20,000 - while the price of the same procedure in the other cities hover between $5,000 and $8,000. 

Herniated disc decompression surgery costs $15,000 in Washington and more than three and a half times more in Houston and Los Angeles - more than $48,000.

A simply tonsillectomy will run $3,500 in Washington - but costs $14,000 in San Francisco. 

The reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers don't like revealing the negotiated final amount.

However, there has been a recent push towards price transparency.

Some states have  started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data.

You can also research the costs of health care further on websites like HealthcareBlueBook.com.

Ouch: Decompressing a herniated disc at a surgical center in Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York costs around the same as four years of college 

Astronomical: Houston has an exceptionally high cost for a carpal tunnel release at a surgical center compared to the rest of the cities 

Simple: It costs about twice the amount to undergo a outpatient carpal tunnel procedure in Miami than it does in New York City
