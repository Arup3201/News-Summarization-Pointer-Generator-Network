Police are hoping that the final words said by a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive may lead them to her killer.

Jessica Chambers was covered in flames when she was found on a road near to her home in the tiny community of Courtland, Mississippi on Saturday after leaving to get a bite to eat.

A passerby called 911 after seeing her car alight and when first responders arrived at the scene and found her covered in flames, she whispered a few words that detectives believe could lead them to her killer, WMC reported.

Police have not disclosed what Chambers said or tried to say, but her father, Ben Chambers, told the channel she told them who was responsible for the horrifying crime.

Tragic: Jessica Chambers, 19, was doused with a flammable liquid and burned alive on Saturday night

Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight

'She told them, she told them, told him who done it,' he said.

She was walking along Herron Road, near Highway 51, and covered in flames when she was found, and was flown to Region One Health in Memphis but later died.

Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body.

Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said she had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Her father also said she had 'a big gash on her head'.

'They squirted lighter fluid down her throat and in her nose, and apparently they knocked her out,' added Mr Chambers, a maintenance worker for the sheriff's department.

'When the fire department got there, she was walking down the road on fire ... only part of her body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.' 

Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information

Scene: Her car was found along this dirt bank and she was found walking along the road in flames

Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. 

'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox affiliate WDBD-TV. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' 

Detectives have been examining the girl's cellphone, which was found at the scene. 

Her car was also at the scene but was left completely charred by the inferno. 

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting Panola authorities because of her father's connection to the police department. No arrests have yet been made.

Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.
