The ideals of female beauty and desirability, for both men and women across the UK, don’t fall far from the images portrayed in glossy magazines and celebrity pin-up calendars, if the latest research is anything to go by.

A new study has looked into what makes a member of the opposite sex 'desirable' and despite the average women weighing around 11st 2lbs and wearing a size 16, 94 per cent of all respondents - both male and female - said that weighing 10 stone or more and wearing above a size 14 was  'undesirable' and 'unattractive'.

And it seems that women are taking note; the study also found that 10 stone is the tipping point for most to try various diet and exercise regimes.

Most desired: The nation has voted and Davina McCall and the Duchess of Cambridge have been voted as having the most desired celebrity bodies

The survey discovered that the celebrities with the most desirable bodies were Davina McCall, the Duchess of Cambridge and Holly Willoughby.

When it came to their own physiques, the majority of men (75 per cent), said that a waist measurement of 36inch or more was the sign it time to go on a diet.

With the average man's waist measuring 35.8in, the research suggests that those polled believe it is more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women.

The survey found that when it comes to our men, the top five most desirable features are toned arms, broad shoulders, masculine features, a pert bottom and non-receding hairline.

Buff bods: Hugh Jackman (L) and David Beckham were voted as having the most desirable male bodies

The least desirable features were, surprisingly, a six-pack, as well as skinny legs and a small frame.

The nation voted Hugh Jackman, David Beckham and Gerard Butler as having the most desirable male bodies.

The survey also uncovered, that while many of those surveyed (46 per cent) will be dieting as part of their New Year’s resolutions, the majority of people will not be partaking in ‘Dry January’ and giving up alcohol.

Weighing in: The study also found that weighing over 10 stone is perceived as undesirable and the tipping point for most females to try various diet and exercise regimes

Chocolate was another item which just under a quarter of those surveyed admitted to not being able to give up.  

A spokesperson for Diet Chef, who commisioned the survey, said: This survey has produced quite interesting results; it’s disturbing to see that the ideal body weight and size for women is so small, especially given our average dress size (size 16), and that it's more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women.

'Rather than concentrating on an ideal size, people, and women in particular, need to be thinking "what’s healthy for me, and how do I achieve a healthy BMI and weight". Not, "how do I look like an airbrushed model". The images of girls in magazines are not realistic; everybody has been airbrushed to look like perfection.'

Speaking about the survey results, Body Image and Wellbeing Expert Katie Lowe of fatgirlphd.com said: 'I'm not in the least bit surprised by the results - it shows once again that when it comes to our ideas around women's health, the emphasis seems to be firmly on the scales, rather than more accurate measurements of physical wellbeing.

'It's interesting that men measure themselves by inches, whereas women use the scales - because measurements are a much more accurate gauge of progress and health on any given weight loss programme, and tend to vary considerably less.

'The reason we place such an emphasis on the scales is due to an overreliance on BMI as a gauge of health - when in reality, it should form only one dimension of an assessment of the physical wellbeing of an individual.

Measuring up: For the majority of men (75 per cent), being a 36inch waist or more was their diet trigger, suggesting that it is far more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women

'It's entirely possible to be unhealthy at 10 stone as it is to be at peak fitness when considerably heavier - it all depends on ratios of muscle, fat and bone, as well as cardiovascular health, and so on.

'From a body image perspective, the number on the scales needs to be just one measurement of our health, and certainly not one of our self-worth - and our ideas of what constitutes a healthy weight need to be more realistic, especially given the average size of women in the UK.

'We can do this in two ways - first, by challenging ideas of what constitutes a healthy weight; and secondly, by moving our body image and self-worth away from that number between our toes.'
