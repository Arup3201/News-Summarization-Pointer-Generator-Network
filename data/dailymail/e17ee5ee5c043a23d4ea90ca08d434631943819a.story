With the Premier League campaign so nearly upon us but many issues still lingering and parts untested, it's time to take an MOT check.

Here, Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai assesses the positives, negatives and what the omen could be for the main contenders this season.

Chelsea

Reasons to be cheerful: After the moans of last season about not having a striker, Jose Mourinho has landed Diego Costa, one of the most effective frontmen in Europe over the past couple of seasons.

Main man: Diego Costa could the answer to Chelsea's attacking problems of the last few seasons

In form: Costa has hit the ground running during pre-season and will be expected to continue in the league 

Reasons to be fearful: A season without a trophy means Mourinho is already under increased pressure. He has been backed with funds and needs to deliver. It is also worth keeping an eye on John Terry. He was brilliant last season, but at some point age will win.

What's happened over the summer: Chelsea have seemingly plugged the biggest gap in their armour by signing Costa, but more to the point they also landed Cesc Fabregas, Didier Drogba and Filipe Luis, without any last-minute rushing around. They look to be in extremely good shape.

What the manager says: ‘We have the squad that we want to have. It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So I like my squad very much.’

One to watch: Costa. He was the missing link last season. If he does what he’s been brought in to do then Chelsea will be the only club that can match Manchester City.

Omen: Last time Fabregas made his debut in England, his club won the league title (even if he didn’t play a league game).

Look who's back: Former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas is back in London after a spell with Barcelona

Manchester City

Reason to be cheerful: The champions look to be in excellent shape. They have the best starting XI and probably the best squad, as well. The signing of Eliaquim Mangala for £32m from FC Porto means they also achieved their No 1 summer objective of landing a world-class centre-back.

Reason to be fearful: Their Financial Fair Play penalty limits their Champions League squad to only 21 players. Manuel Pellegrini’s side also have a tough early schedule against Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal in their opening six games.

What's happened over the summer: Yaya Toure had the mother of all tantrums because he didn’t get a birthday cake, some unwanted players were offloaded and City managed to spend about £50m. Frank Lampard’s arrival will have also riled plenty down south.

Controversial: Frank Lampard made the shock decision to join Manchester City after leaving Chelsea

What the manager says: ‘We've had a lot of problems with Financial Fair Play but we bought some very important players. I don't know what the difference is between Hart and Caballero and Bacary Sagna and Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis, or Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov.’

One to watch: Joe Hart. With Willy Caballero’s arrival, can he hold on to his place? Caballero didn’t look particularly impressive in the Community Shield, but there has always been the feeling that Pellegrini has his doubts about the England No 1.

Omen: All bar one of Manchester City’s Premier League games fall before Toure’s birthday. They have ample time to plan.

Manchester United

Reasons to be cheerful: They have a manager who, unlike David Moyes, has the confidence to know he belongs at the club. To judge from pre-season, that confidence seems to have spread through the squad. In Ander Herrera, they have also signed a quality midfielder.

One to watch: Ander Herrera (right) has impressed for Manchester United during pre-season

Reasons to be fearful: This squad needed major surgery and so far they have only signed three players, with the £30m spent on Luke Shaw held up as an example of the club badly overspending. The defence needs significant reinforcements.

What’s happened over the summer: Regime change and the spread of hope among fans and staff that last season’s debacle was a one-off.

What the manager says: ‘Every club where I have been, I have struggled for the first three months. After that, they know what I want: How I am as a human being and also a manager, because I am very direct. I say things as they are, so you have to adapt to that way of coaching. It's not so easy.’

One to watch: Juan Mata. In Van Gaal’s new formation he is likely to get to play behind the strikers rather than out wide. That should better utilise the talents of one of Europe’s best players.

Omen: Van Gaal has won the league title with all four of the club sides he has managed.

Reputation: Louis van Gaal has won the league title with all four club sides he has managed

Arsenal

Reasons to be cheerful: Arsene Wenger has started spending money and it looks as though he has done it well and early. Alexis Sanchez is a genuinely world-class player, adding to an already impressive attack, and they have also built on their defence.

Reasons to be fearful: Olivier Giroud is not a world-class striker, merely a good one, and they haven’t many alternatives for the centre-forward role should he suffer an injury or loss of form. Sanchez or Theo Walcott might have to be reallocated to cover.

What’s happened this summer: The squad has got stronger all round. Callum Chambers is an excellent defender with the apparent maturity for Wenger to convert him to centre-half. They still lack the depth of Manchester City or Chelsea.

Shining light: Arsenal have splashed the cash again this summer, signing Alexis Sanchez for £30m

What the manager says: ‘There are six or seven teams who are genuine contenders for the Premier League. You only assess the contenders once the window closes. I'm happy with the players we've signed. They have integrated well. I could still do something, I won't rule it out. Numbers wise we are maybe a bit short in certain areas, but the depth of the squad is very good. I'm very excited by this group.’

One to watch: Aaron Ramsey. Sanchez is the star of the team, but Ramsey was consistently brilliant last season. Who knows what might have happened in the title race had he avoided injury.

Omen: Arsenal were the first FA Cup winners to lift the Community Shield since 2009. A special vintage, perhaps?

Back on the right path: Arsene Wenger has lifted the last two trophies on offer in England

Liverpool

Reason to be cheerful: The club is spending money – roughly £100m, in fact - and really backing Brendan Rodgers. Raheem Sterling is arguably the country’s most exciting talent and Rodgers has Liverpool playing beautiful football.

Reason to be fearful: It’s impossible to know how the new signings will bed in, which in turn will dictate how heavily the club miss Luis Suarez. Plus, it’s hugely unfortunate that Adam Lallana got injured just four days after arriving.

What's happened over the summer: They sold Elvis and bought The *** fill in with name of good or terrible music group depending on success of multiple new signings ***

What the manager says: ‘Last season was a great step forward and now we must believe that we can go one better. There is only an excitement and a belief inside the club that we can challenge again for the title.’

One to watch: Raheem Sterling. A wonderful talent who could flourish into a world-class player.

Omen: Tottenham signed half a planet’s worth of player after selling Gareth Bale and it cost them two managers in one season.

Young star: Raheem Sterling has been a real positive for Liverpool in pre-season 

Tottenham

Reason to be cheerful: They have an exciting new manager and none of their key players have been taken away.

Reason to be fearful: They still lack a proper goal-scoring threat and, Ben Davies aside, there have not been many signings that would genuinely excite.

What's happened over the summer: Not a huge amount, besides the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino. Signing Hugo Lloris to a new contract was a significant coup for the club, but beyond Pochettino’s ideology they have not added a huge amount.

What the manager says: ‘I know the business in football. I know that you live by the result, you need to get results. If not, you put yourself in difficulties.’

One to watch: Erik Lamela. He did next to nothing after arriving for £30m but there is an excitement at the club that his injuries are resolved and he might be about to come good.

Omen: Pochettino is Tottenham’s ninth manager since 2001. He starts his era at the club knowing that Tottenham demand good results.

Leading the way: Mauricio Pochettino is looking to help improve Tottenham's fortunes this season

Everton

Reason to be cheerful: Roberto Martinez got the one player he really wanted this summer – Romelu Lukaku.

Reason to be fearful: Pre-season results have been less than spectacular and they have a tough start to the season with their opening seven fixtures including games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool. They also have the challenge of Europa League fixtures and travel.

What's happened over the summer: They signed Roberto Martinez to a long-term contract, likewise Ross Barkley, and avoided losing any of their leading lights. A good effort.

Breaking the bank: Everton signed Belgium star Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea for a club-record fee of £28m

What the manager says: ‘Progress would be to maintain the level we showed last season while coping with the demands of European football. It is about making sure we embrace the Europa league and use that to develop our potential, but not finding it as an obstacle to our domestic duties.’

One to watch: Lukaku. He was superb last season. Now he needs to do it again with the pressure of a £28m price tag.

Omen: The last time Everton splashed big money on a big Belgian (Marouane Fellaini) he did very well at the club. Lukaku has done enough to be considered a success, but what happens subsequent to the big fee will be as important as what went before.
