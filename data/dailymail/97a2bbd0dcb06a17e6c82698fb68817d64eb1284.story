Put down that moisturiser  and remove that man bag from your person boys because metrosexuality is well and truly over. Nowadays it's all about the 'lumbersexuals'.

Not literally men who are lumberjacks (because really, where are you going to find one of those?) but men who look like they could be.  

Unlike their metrosexual brothers these men look rugged, unkempt and like they'd be a dab hand at using an axe... even if they've never picked one up in their lives. 

Kanye West and Ben Affleck both enjoy the lumbersexual look in relaxed shirts, however, there is still a sense that these are men who take pride in their looks

David Beckham used to be the king of the metrosexual men but now he prefers a more relaxed 'lumbersexual' look with his scruffy beard and checked shirt 

They have beards, checked shirts and are decidedly more hipster than the dapper fellows we've been hanging around with for the last ten years.

But unlike real life lumberjacks, where the inspiration for the name of the trend is derived from, their look is still calculated, their beards often groomed to within an inch of their lives, no hair out of place.

As online site GearJunkie says, 'He looks like a hardened outdoorsman but his flannel feels soft to the touch.

'He will open your beer with an omni-present Buck knife. He is a master of the retro Instagram filter. His flannel is coated with a waterproof DWR coating. 

'His laid back style has been honed with more effort than he would like you to know.' 

'Whether the roots of the Lumbersexual are a cultural shift toward environmentalism, rebellion against the grind of 9-5 office jobs, or simply recognition that outdoor gear is just more comfortable, functional and durable, the Lumbersexual is on the rise. 

'Lumbersexuals' should not be confused with real life lumberjacks who actually do frequent forrests and enjoy chopping trees

Model Ricki Hall has previously revealed that he does not identify with the 'hipster' label some people have bestowed upon him. But how would he feel about being a lumbersexual?

Many celebrities have already been giving the look a go. From Kanye West who has long been a fan of the plaid flannel shirts favoured by real life lumberjacks, to Ben Affleck whose off-screen look is relaxed, almost scruffy at times.

David Beckham, Professor Green and Sienna Miller's partner Tom Sturridge are all also in on the lumbersexual trend, often shying away from being overly preened whether they're heading out for a walk, or heading to the red carpet.

Some websites though have joked that these men are just metrosexuals in disguise with Urban Dictionary describing them as, 'A Metro-sexual who has the need to hold on to some outdoor based rugged-ness, thus opting to keep a finely trimmed beard.' 

Professor Green heads to a party rocking a checked shirt and cap, perhaps he hurt is leg going for a ramble in the woods 

Sienna Miller's partner actor Tom Sturridge enjoys a relaxed look coupling his checked shirt with a pair of boots that would be suitable for wearing on a hike

Indeed, it does seem that whilst these men look like they could have just stepped out of the woods there is a conscious decision - and a considerable amount of effort - behind their styling. 

And even though it is likely that we will be seeing lumbersexuals around more and more, writer Peter Lawrence Kane thinks that men probably won't want to take ownership of the label themselves.

'It goes without saying that virtually no man ever called himself a metrosexual, which really just referred to men who shopped for their own pants, went to the gym, and used moisturizer,' he said. 

'So don’t expect the term Lumbersexual to blow up, no matter how ubiquitous Lumbersexuals become.'
