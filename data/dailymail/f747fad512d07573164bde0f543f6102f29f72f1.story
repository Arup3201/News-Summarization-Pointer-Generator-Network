Jack Hyer of Whitefish, Montana, went on his first date with fellow University of Montana student Rebecca Strellnauer on September 30 2010 and afterwards vowed that one day he would marry her.

As part of his studies, Jack, 22, knew he would be embarking on a lot of traveling over the next four years and so he vowed to record something special in each country in preparation for the big day when he would propose to his beloved.

The love struck student, who studied Management Information Systems and International Business, hit upon the ingenious idea of lip-syncing to I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) by Scottish band The Proclaimers.

The 1980s song tells a story of romantic devotion despite being separated by great distance, something Jack felt reflected his feelings for Rebecca.

Over the next four years Jack's travels took him all over the world, but in each country he made sure to have a friend record him lip-syncing along to at least part of the song so he could eventually edit it all together.

The amazing video features Jack displaying his shaky lip-syncing skills in an eclectic number of locations including Cambodia, Israel, China, Greece, France, London and Turkey.

I do! Rebecca is overcome with emotion after Jack shows her the completed video and she says 'yes' to his epic proposal

'I've been on many adventures. I've traveled on elephant, on camel-back, hiked to the lowest point on the earth and I've gotten to see some of the highest,' he said.

'But the best adventure I've had is loving Becca.' 

Their families cheer, of course Rebecca accepts and Jack gets that reaction he had waited four long years for.
