A former Navy SEAL and Survivor finalist has been involved in a car crash in Virginia Beach today.

Rudy Boesch, 85, reportedly walked away from the crash at the intersection of King Richard Drive and Virginia Beach Boulevard without serious injury.

Another car rolled and trapped its occupants, and the eastbound lanes of Virginia Beach Boulevard were blocked for about an hour in the early afternoon.

According to PilotOnline.com, Boesch was on his way to get gas at Sam’s Club in his 2009 Toyota Camry when the two-car accident happened.

A police department spokeswomen said no charges are being filed because police could not determine who was at fault in the accident.

The entrance and exit to the Sam’s Club was blocked due to the accident, but all lanes were reopened later.

Boesch told PilotOnline he was unhurt in the prang.

'I feel good,' he said. 'Nothing is wrong.'

Boesch is best known as the oldest-ever competitor on the television show Survivor, starring first in Survivor: Borneo at 73 and then Survivor Allstars two years later at 75.

Decade: It's been 10 years since Boesch's last appearance on 'Survivor'; he's now 85 years old

He joined the Navy in 1945. According to 
NavySeals.com, he immediately volunteered for 'secret and hazardous 
duty' with the Amphibious Scouts and Raiders, which are highly 
classified naval commando units.

In 1962, Boesch was one of the 50 hand-selected officers of the original SEAL Team TWO, becoming one of its most distinguished members.

After completing 45 years of active service, Boesch was honorably discharged in 1990.

Boesch was one of the final three players in Survivor: Borneo, but was eliminated from the final immunity challenge of the season and subsequently voted out of the game. This was followed by a second shot in 2004 on Survivor Allstars, when he was the second person voted off the show.

After his first Survivor season, Boesch appeared in an episode of JAG and in 2001, he hosted the History channel's Modern Marvels Survivor Guide week. He then hosted Combat Missions on the USA Network and wrote a book, The Book of Rudy.
