A Wild Boar's head stuffed with fruit was usually the main dish at any feast when King Henry VIII entertained guests, especially during the festive period.

And now centuries later it looks like the dish could make a Christmas comeback as a challenger to the traditional turkey as the price of the meat continues to soar.

One of the champion's of the dish is Daniel Doherty, the head chef of the Duck & Waffle in London.

Revival: Could pig's head take the place of turkey at this year's Christmas table? The economic delicacy costs £5 against £60 for a free-range turkey

His delicacy costs £5 against roughly £60 for a free-range turkey - the face provides the meat and the pork-infused wine can be served as savoury pre-dinner cocktail.

'Turkey can be a pain to cook,' Mr Doherty told the Guardian.

'You need two packs of butter and a litre of gravy to make sure it's not too dry. Plus you lose your morning to cooking when you could be getting tipsy on mulled swine.'

Blast from the past: King Henry VIII often hosted elaorate dinner parties which would have featured a pig's head

'People have realised that turkey isn't necessarily the most delicious thing to have at Christmas,' said Fearnley-Whittingstall, in a break from being mobbed for autographs and photos.

'Even if you are a tradition addict, if you are a keen cook you will want to surround the festivities with more up-to-the-minute and exciting food.'

He is planning roast beef sirloin and oysters for his extended family.

Although a pig's head with a glistening snout sitting in the middle of a family table is not for the sensitive, it may be welcomed by some watching their purse strings as a typical large frozen turkey, enough to feed more than ten people and 
leave some over for sandwiches, will be around £3 more expensive at £20.

However,
people buying fresh from a butcher will probably be paying at least £60
– and potentially much more -  for a bird of that size.

At
the same time other key essentials for the feast, such as potatoes, 
carrots, peas and, of course, sprouts, are also more expensive.

The
latest official figures from Smithfield market suggest the price of 
turkey is up by some eight per cent in the past year.

At the same time, 
the British Turkey Federation claims a smaller increase of six per cent.

However,
a snapshot survey conducted this weekend found a the price of a large 
frozen turkey in supermarkets was up by some 17 per cent in a year.

Research
by The Grocer magazine last year put the price of a frozen turkey 
weighing 5-6kg at £17, however this year it is around £20,

Tesco is currently charging £20 and Sainsbury’s £22 for a bird weighing 5.3-6.9kg, while Asda is charging £20 for a 5.8kg bird.

Changing times: Turkey has been the main dish of Christmas meals for decades, but could it now be replaced with turkey?

The
other Christmas dinner essential, Brussel sprouts, are up by some 19per
cent this year -  a rise from £2.10 a kilo to some £2.50

At
the same time a 2.5kg pack of white roasting potatoes is up by some 
15per cent to £2. The increases for carrots and peas are smaller.

Smoked salmon and stilton are now as much
a part of Christmas as the turkey. The survey found that Blue Stilton 
is up by around 5 per cent to £2.32 for just 100g, while smoked salmon 
is up by some 28 per cent to £4 for a 100g pack.

Paul Kelly, chairman of the British 
Turkey Federation, said: ‘Massive fluctuations in the price of feed 
affects the price of a turkey but people will still 'trade up' at 
Christmas by getting the best they can afford. This year you'll be 
paying around £53 for a 4kg turkey.’

1 Pig's head, cleaned and-tongue removed

1 ts 5-spice powder

2 tb Sal

1/2 c Mien see (ground brown bean -sauce) Or 1/2 c Oyster sauce

1/4 c Bourbon

1 c Honey, combined with

1 c Boiling water

Remove any hair on head by singeing over and open flame or plucking. Scrub well (using a vegetable brush, if desired) and then sprinkle with salt, rubbing it into the skin. Rinse well with cool water; pat dry. Remove any excess fat.

Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettleful of boiling water over. Let cool.

Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon. Slash the meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin. Place head upright on a rack in a large baking pan

Bake at 375 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Lower heat to 325 degrees and continue cooking for an additional 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the skin well every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture. (Cooking time will depend on the size of the head.)

If ears begin to brown too quickly during cooking period, wrap them with foil.

When head is done, remove to platter and garnish with water- cress or coriander. Chop head into pieces and serve with sweet vegetable relish or plum sauce.
