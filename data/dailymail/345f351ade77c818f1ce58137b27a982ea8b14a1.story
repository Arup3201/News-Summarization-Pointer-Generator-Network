An oil tycoon who was recently ordered to pay nearly $1billion in a divorce settlement to his wife, has seen his fortune cut in half due to a plunge in oil prices. 

Harold Hamm, 68, was, until recently, a man worth more than $20billion, but a drop in price of crude oil has seen has seen the value of his shares in his company fall by more than $12 billion since August. 

This comes after the Continental Resources CEO was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm last month. 

Harold Hamm was ordered by an Oklahoma County judge to hand over close to $1 billion to his ex-wife Sue Ann Hamm (pictured), according to court filings released on Monday

Special Judge Howard Haralson found that Hamm, 68, should pay Mrs Hamm a total of $995.5million, with about a third of the funds, or $322.7million, to be paid by the end of the year, the filing revealed.

Hamm will then be required to pay the rest of the judgment, some $650million, in installments worth at least $7million per month.

Sue Ann Hamm has already been awarded around $25million since the case was filed in 2012.

To secure the judgment, Judge Haralson has placed a lien on 20 million shares of Continental stock.

The ruling, which is subject to appeal, comes after a ten-week divorce trial which ended last month.

Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 per cent of the firm's shares are in his name. 

Forbes named the oil tycoon the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world. His fortune is estimated at $14billion today

Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a small-time driller worth less than $50million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies.

Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. 

But under Oklahoma law, their 'active' appreciation since 1988 is subject to 'equitable distribution' with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012.

Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. 

In a court filing from 2013, Mrs Hamm alleged that her husband was having an affair, which prompted her to file for divorce. 

Mrs Hamm, 56, has held key posts at Continental, but she no longer works for the company. 

Court filings showed that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement.

Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case.

In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control - that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth.

The trial ended on October 9. 

This is the second divorce for Hamm after he divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They have three children together.

In 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann, an economist and lawyer. The couple had two daughters, Jane and Hillary. 

The oil magnate lives in Oklahoma City and owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma. 

The vast Nichols Hills property is believed to be worth in the region of $3million.

Forbes named him the 30th richest person in the U.S. in 2012 and 76th richest person in the world.

He had humble beginnings, growing up in rural Oklahoma where he was the 13th child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers. 

Mr Hamm spent his youth picking cotton, before starting his career at 20 by scrubbing the scum out of oil barrels. He worked his way up and was eventually able to drill his own wells. 

Fond of eating at burger bars, Mr Hamm has a reputation for being down-to-earth and drives his own truck. 

His big breakthrough came in the Nineties, when he helped discover the Bakken field of North Dakota, the largest new US oil prospect since the Sixties.

Mr Hamm is a staunch Republican and donated close to a million dollars to Mitt Romney's presidential bid in 2012.
