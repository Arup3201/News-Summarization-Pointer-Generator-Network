Barcelona spent an unexpected extra night in Amsterdam following their Champions League win over Ajax after their plane broke down.

Luis Enrique's squad had been due to return to Barcelona from the Dutch city straight after their match at the Amsterdam ArenA on Wednesday night, but their aircraft had engine trouble and was taken out of service.

After a replacement plane could not be found, the team spent the night in Amsterdam and are due to fly back at midday on Thursday.

While the team found a hotel, fans and journalists were not so lucky, with some spending the night at Schiphol Airport.

At least they had Barcelona's 2-0 victory to cheer them up as a double from Lionel Messi helped them through into the knockout phase.

Messi's two goals brought him level with former Spain striker Raul at the top of the all-time Champions League goalscoring charts.

Barcelona, who are currently fourth in La Liga, play Almeria on Saturday afternoon.
