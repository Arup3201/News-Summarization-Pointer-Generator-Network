Sunderland boss Gus Poyet is determined to give his star men the freedom to fashion another famous victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday.

Poyet limps into the game on the back of a dismal goalless draw with West Brom last week and an FA Cup defeat at Bradford which raised some speculation over his future at the Stadium of Light.

But the Uruguayan has been buoyed by the memory of Sebastian Larsson's winner in last season's corresponding fixture as part of a four-game winning streak which sealed their unlikely survival bid.

Poyet said: 'You cannot make (Jermain) Defoe, (Ricky) Alvarez or (Adam) Johnson become robots and do what you want all the time. They have to have the freedom to go forward and express themselves.

'I think the mix has to be right - it is not perfect at the moment but we are still working on it.'

Sunderland's win at Old Trafford last year was their first since 1968 and Poyet believes that factor could work to the Black Cats' advantage as they seek to find the momentum to escape their latest relegation battle.

Poyet added: 'It is true that there is something different when you don't win for years and years in a place and you go there and it looks like it is going to be more difficult than ever, and we did change that.

'I think that is going to bring something different to the players - at least those who have been here a while.'

But Poyet warned the extent of United's current travails have been greatly exaggerated and believes Louis Van Gaal's men are still on course for a top-four finish.

United's surprise defeat at Swansea last weekend heaped more pressure on the Dutchman in light of recent questions over his style of play since arriving to replace David Moyes last summer.

Poyet said: 'I think it is going to be a totally different game - nothing compared to last year when Ryan Giggs was their caretaker and we were playing for our lives.

'Now they are in the process of changing their style of play - for a team that has been playing for 20-plus years in the same way it is going to be a difficult process.

'I think people are being a little bit harsh on Manchester United at the moment. They are not as bad as people think because they are in a good position, and if they get in the top four a few people are going to have to recognise they have done better than people expected.'

Poyet suffered a blow this week with the news that Italian striker Emanuele Giaccherini is almost certain to miss the remainder of the season after undergoing ankle surgery.

But his squad is otherwise nearing full fitness with only Billy Jones and Jack Rodwell struggling for the Old Trafford trip, and more likely to be rested with a view to returning for Tuesday night's crucial trip to Hull. 

Despite their shock 2-1 loss to Swansea, Poyet insists that Manchester United should not be underestimated
