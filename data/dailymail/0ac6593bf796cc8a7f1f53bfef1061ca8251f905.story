Supermarket chain Coles has been banned for three years from advertising that its bread is made or baked on the day it is sold.

Coles was also ordered to display a Federal Court notice in its stores and on its website informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law by falsely advertising bread products as 'Baked Today, Sold Today' and 'Freshly Baked In-Store'.

The ban only applies to products that are partially baked off-site and then finished in-store.

The Federal Court has banned Coles from advertising its par-baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years

It does not apply to those that are made from scratch inside Coles bakeries.

Federal Court Judge James Allsop made the ruling on Monday after Coles was found guilty in June for making false, misleading and deceptive representations in relation to the freshness of its Cuisine Royale and Coles Bakery products.

Coles has been banned from promoting its bread as baked on the day it is being sold or made from fresh dough for three years.

It must tell consumers of the ban and that it had been found to have made the false, misleading and deceptive representations by advertising bread as fresh when it had been made and partially baked and then frozen, sometimes months earlier overseas.

In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a Coles spokesman said the supermarket giant would obey the Federal Court ruling, 'including the publication and in-store display of corrective notices'.

'Packaging and marketing materials for the affected bakery products were changed some time ago, and a final check of stores will be complete within 7 days to ensure any affected signage has been removed,' he said. 

Coles said it would obey the court ruling which includes informing shoppers that it had broken Australian consumer law

The spokesman also added it was never Coles' intention to mislead its customers.

'But we accept that we could have done a better job in explaining how these products are made, and we have already made changes to ensure customers are properly informed,' he said.

'Whether baked from scratch in-store or "par baked" by our suppliers and finished in our ovens, our bread and baked goods are excellent quality products which taste great and remain popular with customers.'

Consumer advocacy group CHOICE has welcomed news the Federal Court decision.

'Credence claims such as "freshly baked" or "baked today" can lead consumers to pay a premium in the mistaken belief they are purchasing a superior product,' CHOICE Head of Media Tom Godfrey said.

'Consumers should have confidence that there is truth in product labels. 

'The court decision over Coles' conduct is a step forward for consumers and sets a very strong standard that misleading and deceptive representation will not be taken lightly.'

'The average consumer would have found Coles' "Baked Today, Sold Today" and "Freshly Baked In-Store" claims hard to swallow when it was revealed that breads were actually partially baked and frozen as far away as Ireland, then shipped to Australia and finished off in-store months later.'

The court is yet to make a decision on whether to fine Coles, which faces penalties of more than $3 million.
