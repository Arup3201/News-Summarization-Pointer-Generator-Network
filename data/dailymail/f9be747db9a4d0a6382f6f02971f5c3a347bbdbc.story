A Gold Coast man who filmed himself doing a handstand on top of a moving car earlier this year has been found guilty of dangerous driving.

Ryuichi Hozaki and his lawyers challenged the dangerous driving charge at Southport Magistrates Court on Monday, where he is currently on trial over the incident.

But Gold Coast Bulletin report that Magistrate Paul Johnstone said 'the manner of driving cannot be described as anything else but dangerous.'

Ryuichi Hozaki filmed himself handstanding on the roof of his car in February of this year

Footage from February showed the 30-year-old exit the window of his small Toyota as it coasted down a deserted street at 15 kilometres per hour.

He the lifted himself into a handstand and held the upright position for a few seconds before re-entering his vehicle. The video revealed he repeated this movement a number of times.

The Southport man was travelling down a secluded road in an industrial park in Burleigh Heads, at twilight when he shot the film.

However Hozaki, an agile acrobat and stuntman told the court he believed the activity was safe, and said 'It depends on what you think dangerous means'.

It is understood he recorded the footage to post to Facebook page 'Handstand February', a group which encourages amateur and professional acrobats and atheletes alike to work on their handstands every day for the month.

The aim of the page is for the community to coach each other on techniques, and members are encouraged to document their progress through a daily picture posted online.

In February, officers were alerted to the stunt when onlookers contacted police who then seized Hozaki's smartphone and found the footage.

The Japanese national was then charged with dangerous driving, which can carry a penalty of up to three years in jail.

However Hozaki's solicitor Colin Greatorix challenged this charge, and said it should instead be replaced with a count of driving without due care and attention.

The 30-year-old said he had chosen to execute the stunt at night in a secluded area to risk the chance of any accident occurring.

He has been found guilty and sentenced to one year probation and community service.
