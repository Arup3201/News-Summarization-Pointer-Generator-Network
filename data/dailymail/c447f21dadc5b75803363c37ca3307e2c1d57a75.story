Britain’s top female police officer has quit Scotland Yard to take up a secretive job in the Foreign Office.

Assistant Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, who headed the bungled operation that led to the death of innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes, announced she was stepping down after 31 years in the force.

The Government today refused to reveal the role Miss Dick will take up – but confirmed she had joined the Foreign Office.

Her departure comes just months after she was moved from a key counter-terror role at the Metropolitan Police.

The controversial 54-year-old was assistant commissioner in charge of specialist operations, including counter-terrorism, between July 2011 and summer this year.

But the new Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan-Howe moved her to specialist crime and operations for the last few months of her career – stripping her of counter-terror responsibilities.

Miss Dick was appointed assistant commissioner at the force in 2009 - 26 years after joining the Metropolitan Police in 1983.

She was in charge of the operation which led to Mr de Menezes being shot seven times in the head in 2005 after being mistaken for a suicide bomber.

She gave evidence at an Old Bailey trial and the inquest last year, coming close to tears as she described the ‘horrible'' and ‘terrible' tragedy.

She denied that she gave an order that Mr de Menezes must be stopped from getting on to a train at Stockwell ‘at all costs’ and also denied instructing the firearms teams to use lethal force to stop him.

Miss Dick said: ‘I first joined the Met in 1983 and have loved my time as a police officer in London.

‘It has been a wonderful privilege to work in such an extraordinary organisation and with such fabulous people. I feel very lucky to have done so. I will miss you all.’

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ‘Cressida Dick has been a fantastic leader in the Metropolitan Police and takes on some of the most difficult roles in policing.

‘She is a role model for women across the service. We wish her well for the future.’

Miss Dick will leave Scotland Yard on January 19 to take up a new role in the Foreign Office.
