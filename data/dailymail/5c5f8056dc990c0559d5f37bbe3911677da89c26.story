He's the footballer who hit headlines last year after  reportedly flying a Serbian model out to visit him on a private jet - and has even been hailed the new Ronaldo.

And it seems that Neymar Jr really is set to steal Cristiano's heartthrob crown, if his latest fashion campaign is anything to go by.

International fashion and lifestyle brand, Police, has signed the 23-year-old to be the face of its new Optical range - and he looks seriously dapper in the campaign imagery.

The brand ambassador, who also fronted the spring/summer 2015 sunglasses campaign, models the 'sleek, key, urban eyewear' and the brand says the style of their new glasses is synonymous with their global brand ambassador. 

It seems no expense was spared for the FC Barcelona star; industry heavyweight Rankin was called in to shoot the campaign.

Starring alongside the heartthrob is Mexican model Daniela de Jesus, who has worked with GUESS?, Vivienne Westwood and Abercrombie.  

Neymar follows in the footsteps of past Police ambassadors who include Bruce Willis, George Clooney, David Beckham and Antonio Banderas.

It was revealed last year that Neymar reportedly sent a private plane for Serbian model Soraja Vucelic to bring her to visit him in the Spanish city of Barcelona.

Tabloid Kurir reported that Soraja, 28, and the footballer met last summer in Ibiza and since then she and the Brazilian national football team star have reportedly been chatting frequently via Skype. 

And it seems things are hotting up after Neymar, whose full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, sent an aeroplane to pick her and her female friend up.

According to the newspaper, Soraja allegedly flew to Neymar in Barcelona and stayed there for several days.

The paper claims that the couple first agreed she would visit him at the end of October, but then decided they couldn't wait that long and instead he cancelled the tickets and sent a private plane to collect her instead.

The model later published a photo in Neymar's Barcelona FC jersey in the aeroplane on her Instagram account.

Soraja Vucelic became popular in Balkans after participating in their Big Brother show. Since then she has become a pin-up girl for many local men and has huge local fan club. 

There's no wonder the busty model is a fan of Neymar. The young star has scored 40 goals in 58 matches for Brazil, making him the fifth highest goalscorer for his national team.

He's won accolades such as most marketable athlete in the world and last year, The Guardian hailed him as the sixth best player in the world.
