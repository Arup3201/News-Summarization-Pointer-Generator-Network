Scientists have developed a crude form of telepathy in animals by enabling a pair of rats to pass instructions using only their mind.

Using microchips implanted in their brains to communicate, the rats were able to collaborate and solve simple puzzles, even though in one experiment they were thousands of miles apart.

Researchers claim this is the first example of a 'brain-to-brain interface', raising the prospect that one day animals - and humans - could be able to read each other's minds.

The rats were connected to each other via a special interface which plugged directly into their brain

The team from Duke University in 
North Carolina said: 'As far as we can tell, these findings demonstrate 
for the first time that a direct channel for behavioural information 
exchange can be established between two animals' brains without the use 
of the animal's regular forms of communication.'

Lead researcher, Miguel
 Nicolelis, a pioneer of research into brain-computer interfaces, said 
the study was the first step towards the linking of multiple minds to 
form an 'organic computer' or 'brain-net' that would allow sharing of 
information among groups of animals.

'We cannot even predict what kinds of
 emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part
 of a brain-net,' he said.

'In theory, you could imagine that a 
combination of brains could provide solutions that individual brains 
cannot achieve by themselves.'

He said it could even lead to one animal 
incorporating another's sense of 'self', although there are fears it 
could result in the development of mind control.

In the experiments, published in the 
journal Scientific Reports, microscopic electrodes implanted into the 
rats' brains enabled one animal to pass on instructions to the other, 
even though it was in a separate cage.

The first rat, known as the 
'encoder', was taught to find water in its cage by responding to a light
 and pressing a particular lever.

Its brain was connected to a second 
animal, known as the 'decoder', which was not given the light signals.

Instead, the second animal relied 
solely on the brain instructions, but when stimulated still pressed the 
right lever to receive a reward 70 per cent of the time - far more often
 than it would have by chance, demonstrating they had been guided by the
 other rat's mind.

Remarkably, the communication between
 the rats seemed to be two-way.

The encoder rat did not receive a full 
reward if the decoder made a wrong choice, and as a result, became more 
decisive and generated clearer brain signals.

'We saw that when the decoder rat 
committed an error, the encoder basically changed both its brain 
function and behaviour to make it easier for its partner to get it 
right,' said Dr Nicolelis, who claimed this suggested a 'behavioral 
collaboration' between the pair of rats.

A second test involved pairs of rats 
distinguishing between narrow and wide openings using their whiskers.

Again, signals transmitted from one rat helped the other take the 
right action to obtain a reward.

Evidence from this study suggested 
that the decoder rat began to develop a double identity, by picking up 
sensations from two sets of whiskers - its own and those of its partner.

'Our studies of the sensory cortex of
 the decoder rats in these experiments showed that the decoder's brain 
began to represent in its tactile cortex not only its own whiskers, but 
the encoder rat's whiskers, too,' said Dr Nicolelis.

Microscopic electrodes implanted into the 
rats' brains enabled one animal to pass on instructions to the other, 
even though it was in a separate cage.

The first rat, known as the 
'encoder', was taught to find water in its cage by responding to a light
 and pressing a particular lever.

Its brain was connected to a second 
animal, known as the 'decoder', which was not given the light signals.

Instead, the second animal relied 
solely on the brain instructions, but when stimulated still pressed the 
right lever to receive a reward 70 per cent of the time - far more often
 than it would have by chance, demonstrating they had been guided by the
 other rat's mind.

'We detected 
cortical neurons that responded to both sets of whiskers.'

This 
experiment was repeated with another pair of rats, one in the US city of
 Durham, North Carolina, the other in Natal, Brazil.

By recording brain signals from one 
rat and transmitting them over the internet to the other, scientists 
were able to alter the second rodent's behaviour despite the vast 
distance.

British expert Professor Christopher 
James, from the University of Warwick, who has conducted similar 
research, said: 'We are far from a scenario of well-networked rats 
around the world uniting to take us over, the stimulation is crude and 
specific.

'As for the ethics, I struggle to think of any applications 
that would not have ethical issues.'
