Staff at the BBC were last night urged to come forward with information as a nationwide police inquiry was launched into Sir Jimmy Savile’s alleged reign of child abuse.

It came as more women said they were raped or molested as girls by the ‘predatory’ BBC presenter.

At least six police forces have now received allegations of abuse, and the Metropolitan Police has been chosen to co-ordinate inquiries.

Nationwide inquiry: Staff at the BBC have been urged to come forward with information about Jimmy Savile's alleged reign of abuse as at least six police forces revealed they had received allegations

A Scotland Yard spokeman said: ‘The assessment will be undertaken by the Serious Case Team of the Met’s Child Abuse Investigation Command.

‘Our priority will be to ensure a proportionate and consistent policing response putting the victims at the heart of our enquiries.’

The Met urged potential victims to contact their local police stations.

The BBC’s director of editorial policy, David Jordan, told ITV News that the corporation’s employees should tell police what they know.

‘It is very important that anybody who knows anything, who has evidence, or saw anything, gets in touch with their local police force.

‘The BBC is appalled that these acts could have happened on BBC premises and been conducted by one of the BBC’s great stars of the past.’

He also said the broadcaster may now air footage gathered for the abandoned Newsnight investigation into Savile’s alleged abuse.

The decision to axe the BBC2 film, not long after the presenter’s death, sparked anger among the corporation’s journalists and led to speculation it was to protect the BBC’s reputation.

Appearing on the BBC News channel, Mr Jordan said: ‘I can’t see why [the footage] couldn’t be broadcast in some way or another. If the women concerned who have given the evidence want that to happen, I’m sure it can happen.’

During a tumultuous week for the BBC, at least ten women have alleged Savile sexually abused them as youngsters.

On Monday, six women were revealed to have made chilling accusations about Savile in an explosive ITV documentary.

It prompted a seventh woman to walk into a Surrey police station and allege Savile raped her at 15 in 1986 when she was on work experience at the BBC.

On Tuesday, two more women, Katrina Rose and Bebe Roberts, were the first to bravely waive their anonymity and claim they too were victims of the Jim’ll Fix It star.

The next day, another woman told the Mail she had been raped and made pregnant by Savile when she was a 16-year-old virgin.

The woman, now 65, was forced to have an illegal abortion without painkillers, and spent two years paying back her grandmother for the cost of the procedure.

Since then, several more women have contacted the Mail, ITV News and the police with further allegations.

Among them, Karin Ward claimed she was abused in Savile’s dressing room aged 14 at the same time as paedophile Gary Glitter was raping a 13-year-old girl.

Glitter, jailed twice over child abuse, has rejected the allegation.

The BBC has been accused of turning a blind eye to the abuse and allowing one of its biggest stars to boast that he was ‘untouchable’.

It emerged the presenter – who died last year aged 84 – was interviewed under caution by Surrey Police in 2007, but no charges were brought. He had allegedly preyed on vulnerable under-age girls at now-defunct Duncroft School in Surrey, bursting into their bedrooms when they were undressing.

At the BBC, girls who appeared on Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It said they were groomed by Savile who forced himself on them in his dressing room, his Rolls-Royce and in his caravan.

Several women have alleged BBC staff including producers were told of the abuse and ignored it.

In Jersey, up to five girls abused at the Haut de le Garenne children’s home named Savile, their solicitor Alan Collins said yesterday.

Girls as young as nine were allegedly molested by the Radio One DJ at the Jersey ‘house of horrors’.

Mr Collins said: ‘Jimmy Savile’s name came up several times. I interviewed people who claimed to have suffered abuse at the home, and several told me they had been abused there by Savile.’

Ex-BBC press officer Rodney Collins, who reported newspaper rumours against Savile to his superiors in 1973, said last night: ‘There should be a full inquiry, they should co-operate with the police. If anyone working there at the time had some knowledge of this they should speak up.’

A BBC spokesman added: ‘We have asked the BBC investigations unit to make direct contact with all the police forces in receipt of allegations and offer to help them investigate these matters and provide full support to any lines of inquiry they wish to pursue.’

The Met said: ‘We will be making contact with all those concerned in due course. We will be working closely with the BBC investigations unit.’
