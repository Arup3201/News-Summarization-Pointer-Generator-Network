Ed Miliband was branded out of touch last night after Labour unveiled its latest crusade over the ‘cost of living’ crisis – the price of a gym membership.

Shadow Public Health Minister Luciana Berger complained that two-thirds of local authority gyms and leisure centres have increased the cost of an annual membership in the last three years – by up to £100.

Labour blamed the Prime Minister, declaring: ‘Since 2010, David Cameron has made severe cuts to local government, leaving council services struggling for money.’

But Tories hit back, saying that gym membership is hardly the most pressing issue for those in economic hardship and suggested that anyone can exercise for free by going jogging.

Labour claimed that the rocketing membership costs at local authority-owned leisure centres meant that New Year's resolutions would be harder to keep.

A survey of 95 English councils found a yearly pass now costs £368 on average, an increase of £15 since 2010 - but 48 councils introduced above-average hikes.

Single classes after work on weekday evenings have risen in price at almost every local authority centre and now average £5.95 per visit, Labour found.

The highest increase in annual membership costs - £98 - was introduced by Southampton City Council, followed by a £91.50 hike by Wealden District Council and £80.50 by Hastings Borough Council.

Miss Berger said: 'Millions of people across the country will want to kick-start 2014 by getting fitter and more active.

'There is a real risk, however, that many people will be put off from keeping to their new year's resolutions by soaring gym charges and David Cameron's failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.

'With worrying obesity levels and stagnating physical activity levels, we desperately need ministers to make gym and leisure facilities accessible and affordable for all.'

But Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, suggested the issue is more likely to concern people in the leafy corners of North London where Mr Miliband lives and Miss Berger grew up.

He said it was ‘not the number one concern of my constituents in Essex’, adding: ‘What are Labour going to be fretting about next? The cost of quinoa, polenta and sundried tomatoes?’

‘It’s the costs of refuelling cars and heating homes that they should be focused on not how much it costs the metropolitan elite to keep fit.

Another Tory source said: ‘This is a bit desperate even by Labour’s standards. To suggest that you have to join a gym to get into shape is ridiculous. Anyone can go running for free.’
