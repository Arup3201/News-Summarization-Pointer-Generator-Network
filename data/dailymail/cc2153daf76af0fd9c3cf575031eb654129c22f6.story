A woman who spent $15,000 on black-market butt injections that nearly killed her, is dedicating her life to saving others from the same fate.

Vanity Wonder, 30, says she is lucky to be alive after becoming addicted to using illegal silicone shots to increase her hips and behind.

Appearing on the latest episode of TLC’s My Strange Addiction, she gives advice to fellow addict Karmello who has filled her buttocks with two litres of liquid from illegal injections, taking it from a size four to a size ten.

Example: Vanity Wonder's addiction nearly killed her and she pleads with Karmello to stop the injections

Bad surgery: Vanity had her last injection two years ago, after she nearly died from an infection as a result of a jab

Obsessed: Karmello, 23, is addicted to getting the injections which have helped her increase her behind with three dress sizes

Karmello, 23, from Detroit, Michigan, admits to 
having had 54 injections to her buttocks and plans another 36 to get her behind to the 
perfect size.

The mother-of-one was unhappy with her figure and started with the injections three years ago.

Despite her 
determination to increase her behind the medical way, not one of the 
injections have been performed by a plastic surgeon.

Instead
she gets them on the black market from a woman she often meets in a 
hotel, spending thousands of dollars on filling her body with unknown 
liquids.

Dangerous addiction: Karmello inspects her behind in the mirror, a result of three years of illegal injections

Black market: In her bid to have the perfect behind she has filled her buttocks with more than two liters of unknown liquids through illegal shots

Unnatural: Karmello's surgically enhanced behind is the result of high-risk illegal implants and fellow addict Vanity tries to stop her before it is too late

Illegal butt injections have increased in the past years with many black market operators using anything from glue to soy bean oil and industry grade silicone.

The cheap alternative to plastic surgery has become popular among transsexuals and in the African American community.

Those carrying out the procedures, known as ‘shot girls’ take around $300 per injection compared to professional plastic surgery which can cost around $12,000.

In the disturbing episode of the TLC show Karmello’s friend Vanity Wonder, 
author of book Shots Girls who herself spent over $15,000 on illegal 
butt and hip injections, tries to warn Karmello of the risks.

Vanity, who nearly died after 
contracting an infection from a shot, tells her she needs to stop the dangerous practice.

But it is not until Karmello's sister Jennifer also
pleads with her to stop for the sake of her four-year-old son, that she 
visits plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn.

Dr
Youn shows her an x-ray of her buttocks and hips and points out that the fat is 
'sponge-like' and warns her the next injection could kill her.

After she has seen the images of her behind, Karmello decides to fight her addiction and stop the injections.

Not done yet: Karmello estimates that it will take her another 36 injections to get her to the perfect size

Word of warning: Karmello meets up with her friend Vanity Wonder who nearly died from a botched black market infection

Reality check: Karmello is told by plastic surgeon Dr Anthony Youn that the next injection could kill her
