A Columbia University football player has been charged with a hate crime for allegedly assaulting another student and using racial slurs.

Chad Washington was charged with misdemeanor aggravated harassment as a hate crime.

Police say the 19-year-old defensive lineman followed the victim from his dorm room, grabbed him by the collar, yelled racial slurs and threatened to beat him up.

Washington was arraigned on Wednesday and released without bail. His attorney, Daniel Fetterman, said that the allegations did not accurately reflect the events.

The victim is of Asian descent. Washington is black.

The 6ft 4in athlete allegedly heckled two women his victim was with. When the 19-year-old victim came to their defence, Washington grabbed him, law enforcement officials said.

Washington also reportedly sent racist tweets from his account which has now been deleted, according to his college newspaper, Columbia Spectator.

The message, which was sent on March 7, last year, was revealed amid a host of racist and homophobic slurs allegedly sent by the college football team.

The Columbia Spectator also reported that Washington recently wrote an op-ed piece for the newspaper in which he said student athletes deserved more respect than they're given on campus.

School officials said that they were not able to comment on the case.

Washington is due back in court on July 8.

His attorney, Daniel Fetterman, said: 'The allegations do not accurately portray the events that occurred.'

He added: 'When all the facts come out, it will be clear that Mr. Washington did not commit a hate crime, and he will be vindicated.'

The alleged attack and accusations 
of the football team sending racist and homophobic tweets has led 
student leaders at Columbia to draft a statement, Columbia Spectator 
said.

The university's 
Student Wellness Project founder Wilfred Chan said on Facebook that it 
will condemn 'racism, sexism, and associated acts of violence'.
