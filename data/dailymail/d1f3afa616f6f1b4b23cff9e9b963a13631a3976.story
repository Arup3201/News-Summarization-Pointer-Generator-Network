Thursday night: Kaleigh Lambert (right) with boyfriend Colton Mullholland (center) and a friend at the Sugar Bowl last night in New Orleans

It was the six second clip that sent the Internet into a frenzy of speculation - what caused one Ohio State fan to suddenly stop stroking the hair of one blond man and then turn ashen faced as she realized she was on camera during the Sugar Bowl?

Had she been caught with another man? Had she been busted at the big game after calling in sick? And who was the stony faced blond man who appeared unmoved by her affections?

The answer is far less scandalous than some online rumors suggested and far more innocent than others would want.

The somewhat sheepish looking fan is Kaleigh Lambert, 23, an Ohio substitute teacher who was simply consoling her long term boyfriend, Colton Mullholland, after a decisive play did not go their way.

Unfortunately for the gossip mongers online, she had not been caught with her hand in the metaphorical cookie jar.

Indeed, another video recorded just seconds before the viral clip of Kaleigh, shows the truth and reveals how out of context the mysterious footage is.

In it, Kaleigh holds her head in her hands and then turns her attention to Colton, who begins to shake his head with disappointment after a Buckeyes failure.

Her hand rubs the top of his head and then makes its way down to the back of his neck, which is the point where the much discussed six second Vine video begins.

When viewed together, the full story of what really happened becomes clearer.

It becomes obvious that Kaleigh was not caught red-handed by the cameras up to no good, despite what people may want.

She simply did not know what to do with her hand and just left her boyfriend to his own devices after trying to make him feel better.

When the Daily Mail spoke to Kaleigh's mother Suzanne, she said that her daughter had been seeing Colton, 'for quite some time' and said that the Lamberts and the Mullhollands were family friends.

Friends: Kaleigh and Colton (right and second right) with friends back home in Ohio have been revealed as the couple at the center of a viral video sensation 

Innocent: Kaleigh Lambert graduated from the University of Miami and works as a substitute teacher

National attention: Kaleigh is no doubt aware that she has become a viral sensation overnight and the video clip that she features in has been viewed more than 13 million times

Having posted the video - which has been viewed more than 13 million times - onto her own Facebook page, Suzanne laughed at the attention her daughter had received.

'She wasn't guilty of anything,' said Suzanne, amused at how out of context the clip had been taken.

It all began last night when DJ Sourmilk posted the clip online and titled it, 'When you're at the game with your side dude and realize you're on TV'.

Others joined in the speculation.

Act natural: Kaleigh Lambert appeared to be stroking the back of the blond man's head - but when she realized the camera's were on her she suddenly flinched and pulled back her hand

One imaginative viewer posited that Kaleigh and Colton had taken mind altering drugs and the sudden attention of the camea sent her into a deep and sudden crisis.

Apaprently this theory was supported by the guy behind them, presumably their friend, shouting a comforting 'We're OKAY!'.

Other commentators even suggested that Kaleigh had too much to drink and her real boyfriend was the guy on the other side of her, to her left.

Others even questioned whether Kaleigh's boyfriend had made a bad smell and some just thought she had the look of a woman who left the gas on.

Horrified, but why? Kaleigh looks positively mortified to have been caught on camera and appears to try and style it out

What have I done? The Kaleigh suddenly seems extremely preoccupied, unlike the man behind her who is loving being on television
