Ronny Deila warned Celtic’s SPFL Premiership rivals his side will now take some stopping.

The champions returned to the top of the Premiership following a 4-0 rout of shot-shy Motherwell.

A point clear of Aberdeen with a game in hand, Deila believes his team have responded to the Dons’ challenge by stepping up a gear. And he reckons a domestic clean sweep is now a realistic goal ahead of next week’s League Cup semi-final clash with Rangers.

Virgil van Dijk scores the opening goal of the game in the clash between Celtic and Motherwell

Speaking after goals from Virgil van Dijk, Leigh Griffiths and a double from fit-again Mikael Lustig blew Motherwell away, Deila said: ‘Celtic can win every game when they play in Scotland. Every game. We are favourites whoever we meet, wherever we meet them, that’s how it’s going to be.’

Of the view his side have found a new gear since a winter break in Gran Canaria, the Norwegian is gunning for a treble.

‘It’s the second part of the season. If you are Celtic player you see the games ahead and what we can achieve and of course you step up a bit.

‘We can win everything and that’s a good feeling and very, very exciting. We are very determined and looking forward to every game now. On Saturday it’s Ross County.’

Key men Anthony Stokes, James Forrest and Lustig came back from injury, with the Swedish defender claiming two late goals and almost marking his return with a hat-trick.

‘Mikael has good experience now of coming back from injury. I’m very impressed at how quickly he has adapted and come back,’ said Deila. ‘He is an important player for the team.

‘We haven’t pushed him - he needs to be 100 per cent before he plays. We want to have him over a long period of time because we know how good he is. We still have to be careful and not play him for 90 minutes yet.

Lustig then added a third goal to seal the win with 15 minutes remaining

‘I’m very happy for him and hopefully we can get more consistency of selection with him and other players who have been injured.

‘We want to be No 1 and now everything is in our hands. If we win the rest of the games we are champions and that’s the best position we can have. We just have to keep performing like today and winning games then we will see at the end of the season whether it’s a race or not.

‘I feel more comfortable now before games, more safe, and trust the team more than I did before. We are more together and understand what we expect of each other. The training is also good quality now so if we keep what we’ve got it’s going to be hard to beat us.’

Motherwell rarely threatened, with the loss of skipper Keith Lasley with a broken toe a further blow as boss Ian Baraclough seeks to avoid a slide into the bottom two after a fourth straight defeat.

‘It was always going to be difficult coming here,’ he said. ‘They were full of confidence and quality players.

‘We helped our own downfall because we gave away the ball too cheaply. You talk about winning your one v one battles but we lost cheap goals.

‘We put in a lot of hard work in the opening exchanges but that was undone. You’ve got to start picking up points

‘You’d like to think there will be scope to strengthen. We’re in a scrap and we’ll need that kind of player because we’re in that group of three.’
