The University of Texas will pay its student football and basketball players $10,000 a year to fund expenses not covered by a full scholarship and to compensate for the University's use of students' images.

The school has not yet set a date for when they'll be cutting their students paychecks. 

University of Texas Athletic director Steve Patterson said on Tuesday that the $6 million annual budget for student compensation isn't going to burn a hole in their pocket but that even rich programs like UT's will need to set aside funds for the future if they continue to treat their athletes like employees or semi-pros, reports the Dallas News.

Payday: Scholarship athletes on the Texas Longhorns team will be $10,000 richer sometime in the near future after a federal ruling ordered colleges to be more generous towards their athletes 

Outspoken: University of Texas Athletic director Steve Patterson said on Tuesday that the school will need to set aside funds for the future if they continue to treat their athletes like employees or semi-pros

Patterson addressed an audience of athletic professionals in a forum on the ever-changing business of college sports.

Football Scoop reports that the $10,000 per student will be split evenly between the cost-of-attendance and payment for use of the athletes name and image.

The $10,000 figure is the one U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken set in her Ed O'Bannon trial ruling in August.

UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon and 19 others successfully sued the NCAA for violating antitrust laws by blocking athletes from getting a share of the revenues generated from the use of their images in broadcast and video games, reports ESPN.

'The Court finds that the challenged NCAA rules unreasonably restrain trade in the market for certain educational and athletic opportunities offered by NCAA Division I schools,' Wilken wrote.

Football Scoop reports that the $10,000 figure is bound to fluctuate.

'If we begin to [further] remunerate the participants (over and above this figure), that’s going to break that model,' Texas women’s athletics director Chris Plonsky said.

Athletic forum: Steve Patterson and other school athletic professionals convened on Tuesday to talk about the future of college sports and how they will need to adjust their budget to account for the future 

Chis Plonksy explained that the school already employs 350 workers to coach and care for the students who play in Austin.

She added that the money for all of that jobs come from just two sports, football and men's basketball.

Participants of the athletic forum concluded that colleges will be asked to do even more and that they will need yon adjust their business models to make way for the change.

Other panellists expressed their desire for a stronger governing rule in college sports.

'We’re in for a period of dynamic change, ‘said McMillen, a basketball player for the University of Maryland who also played for the United States in the 1972 Olympics in Munich.

'The system has to change. The money needs to be handled differently.'

'Everybody is in charge and nobody is,' said former Athletic Director at Arizona State, Lisa Love.

'What I’m looking for is a benevolent dictator for college sports,' said McMillen. 

USA Today Sports writer Steve Berkowitz said that he worries that schools will spend too much money in order to keep their teams in the running for the championship.

Chris Del Conte who serves as Athletic Director at Christian University (TCU) said that schools who choose to spend money in top athletics should be rewarded for their investments.

TCU said they made the investments neccesary to compete at a national level and were able to joing a major athletics conference.

'We invested, even back when we didn’t know the future of that investment,' he said.

'We decided, and our alumni had decided, that we were going to compete.'

TCU was able to raise $15 million to rebovate a 45,000 seat stadium.

After renovations the applicant pool grew much, much larger. They saw 20,000 applications a year for 1,600 spots.
