Manchester United have made an enquiry for Feyenoord right back Daryl Janmaat.

The Holland defender has been attracting interest from Napoli, Spurs, Arsenal and Leicester.

The 24-year-old has one year left on his contract but has already told the club he is leaving this summer, with team-mates Stefan de Vrij and Bruno Martins Indi also expected to depart.

All have been followed by United scouts prior to Louis van Gaal’s arrival as manager and have been regulars in his World Cup starting line-up.

United have an interest in Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen but are reluctant to match the valuation of £12m.

They remain keen on Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal, but Juve’s £45m asking price and Real Madrid’s interest mean they are evaluating alternatives, such as Madrid’s Sami Khedira and Nigel de Jong of AC Milan.

Needed at the back: United have a massive gap in defence and the 24-year-old has inside running for a spot as he performs for the incoming boss in Brazil
