Parents and three of their young children have died after their 16-year-old son crashed their SUV on the way to Disney World. 

Michael and Trudi Hardman of Terrell, Texas and three of their children aged four, seven, and 15, all died in the accident on the interstate in northeast Louisiana. 

Three other children who were also in the car - including the 16-year-old driver - were taken to a hospital and are expected to survive.

The teenage driver, who was their son, likely fell asleep at the wheel Wednesday on Interstate 20 near Calhoun, police said.

Troopers said he drove left into the median just before 11 p.m. and then tried to get back onto the highway but overcorrected, causing the 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe to roll over.

They said six of the eight people in the SUV were thrown from the vehicle.

Heartbreaking: A message a Facebook user, thought to be Mrs Hardman's cousin,  posted on Thursday

Mrs Hardman, was a kindergarten teacher at Wills Point ISD, and her husband was a second-grade teacher at Terrell ISD.

In a Facebook post Thursday, Wills Point ISD wrote: 'Words cannot express the sadness in our hearts today. … The impact of the tragedy is far reaching and has effected each campus,' the post read.

Hardman also was a little league baseball coach who coached his sons, one of whom, 12-year-old Aaron Hardman, was in critical condition at a Shreveport hospital, Timothy Hardman said. 

He said the two other injured children were treated at the hospital and released Thursday morning.

'He never turned a kid away,' Timothy Hardman said of his brother. 'Michael probably had the biggest heart of anybody you ever knew. He just loved kids.'

French said a counselor contacted the parents of students in Michael Hardman's class to let them know about his death, and counselors also are available to support both staff and students.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family members, colleagues, students and friends,' he said. 'We must lift each other up during this difficult time,' French said.

Trudi Hardman was a kindergarten teacher at Wills Point Primary school, and had worked for the Wills Point Independent School District for about 10 years, Superintendent Suzanne Blasingame said in an email.

Blasingame said Michael Hardman also had formerly taught at Wills Point Primary.

'Our school and community is grieving for this family,' said Blasingame, who had traveled to Louisiana to be with the family. 'We will continue to lift this family up in our prayers.'

Timothy Hardman, 38, of Crandall, Texas, said his brother and Trudi Hardman were married about five years ago and had six children between them. Michael Hardman had three boys from a previous marriage, while Trudi Hardman had two boys from a previous marriage, Timothy Hardman said. The couple had a daughter, Kaci, together, he said.

Timothy Hardman, who traveled to Terrell after he was notified of the accident, said his brother's family had scheduled the trip about nine months ago, and had planned to stay at Disney World for a week.

'They've always talked about it,' he said. 'It was their dream trip. It was an opportunity for them to take all of their kids.'
