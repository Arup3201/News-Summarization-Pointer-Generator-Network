A heavily pregnant young woman was killed and had her baby cut from her womb by a jealous teenager who was angry at having aborted her own child.

Nathaly Cartas Leon, 20, was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her child  when she met 17-year-old Guadalupe Salinas Hernandez on Facebook.

She made contact with Hernandez while looking for items for the baby's nursery and went to the teenagers home. But Nathaly was attacked as soon as she walked through the door.

Hernandez hit the pregnant woman over the head with a blunt instrument, and then stabbed her several times, before cutting her unborn baby from the womb. 

The horrific killing, which happened in the city of Reynosa in the north-eastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, has shocked the entire country 

Although Nathaly had been reported missing, it was only when Hernandez turned up at hospital claiming that the baby had been stillborn that the crime was discovered.

Doctors quickly realized that the teenager was not the mother of the baby as she claimed.

They also concluded that the baby had not died during a natural birth but that it had suffocated in the womb after the death of its mother.

Hernandez later confessed that the baby belonged to a woman she had killed days earlier, and police discovered Nathaly's mutilated body at the teen's home.

It was later discovered that Hernandez had been pregnant and had had an abortion, but later regretted the decision and had planned to claim another baby as hers instead.
