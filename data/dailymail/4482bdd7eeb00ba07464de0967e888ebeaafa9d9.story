Police have seized dangerous fake Christmas toys worth £500,000 bound for stockings across the country. 

This festive season's must have gifts, including Peppa Pig, Disney's Frozen, Angry Birds, and Super Mario toys were among the huge haul discovered in Salford and Manchester.

The pieces are almost exact copies of the real products and are extremely hard to distinguish. 

But they have not been subjected to the rigorous safety tests required by law and have no warnings or advice on the packaging. 

Police have seized dangerous fake Christmas toys worth £500,000 bound for stockings across the country

In one business unit, council trading standards officers and police recovered over 7,000 counterfeit Super Mario toys, over 350 fake Samsung and Galaxy mobile phones and 2,000 knock-off Disney Frozen loom band sets.

In another, they seized 3,700 counterfeit toys, including 21 boxes of Frozen items, 20 boxes of Disney toys, 12 boxes of Spiderman toys and 10 of Toy Story.

Salford's deputy mayor, Coun David Lancaster, said: 'It took officers eight transit van journeys, two combi van journeys and two trips in a people carrier just to remove all the items.

'Those not needed for court evidence will be crushed and recycled.

'These counterfeit goods were targeted at children as young as four but contained sharp points, small parts which a child could choke on and lead in the paint used.

'They were unsafe as well as ripping off legitimate brands. I am delighted we have been able to take them out of circulation.' 

The goods came from two wholesalers in the Broughton area. Samples will now undergo safety testing.

It comes after fake Frozen goods were seized by Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards team  - including children's pyjamas, dolls, fancy-dress costumes, umbrellas,  watches, backpacks and blankets

It is suspected that a number of the items do not conform to EU safety regulations, including pyjamas and fancy-dress costumes that are unlikely to meet flammability guidelines 

Due to the size of the seizure, trading standards officers say that prosecution of the companies is likely.

It comes after a similar hundreds of 'lethal' fake Frozen toys and clothes were seized and destroyed in Nottinghamshire after concerns they could burst into flames and strangle children.

The dodgy Disney items, including counterfeit dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets, were seized at a toy shop last week.

Fancy dress costumes and pyjamas did not conform to 'flammability' standards and are likely to catch fire. 

Trading Standards officers from Nottinghamshire County Council seized the fake merchandise from a toy shop in Newark, Nottinghamshire, during a raid last Tuesday.
