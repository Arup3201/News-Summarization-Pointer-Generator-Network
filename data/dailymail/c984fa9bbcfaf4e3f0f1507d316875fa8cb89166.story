Big Fat Gypsy Wedding stars Swanley and Josie Smith are getting divorced after fighting and blazing rows followed their high-profile TV union.

Josie, 18, has moved out of the couple's caravan and is living in a house in Middlesex with their one-year-old daughter and her mother.

She married Swanley, then 20, when she was just 16, and 6.5million viewers watched her walk up the aisle in a bouffant white dress, followed by bridesmaids dressed in hot pink.

The two fast became one of the Channel 4 series' most popular couples following their extravagant July 2010 wedding.

Their daughter, also named Josie, was born last May. Two months later, Swanley was arrested over a fight at a friend's wedding, when a police officer was reportedly forced to defend himself with CS spray.

Josie was electronically tagged for three months for her part in a bust-up at a gypsy wedding.

But after less than two years as husband and wife, Josie and Swanley have separated and she has gone back to using her maiden name, McFadyen, according to The Sun.

A friend of the couple said: 'There have been some awful rows. The fairytale is over.

'It’s very sad. Things haven’t been going well for a while and Josie thinks that it would be better if they were no longer married. She will be filing for divorce.

'She wants to move on with her life and being with Swanley just isn’t making her happy. She has little Josie to think of too, she’s her number one priority.'

Agent Terry Mills said: 'I can confirm my client has split from her husband. Josie is concentrating on being a good mother.'

The couple featured again in this year’s series and were last seen in public on the red carpet at January’s National TV Awards, where the show was nominated for an award.
