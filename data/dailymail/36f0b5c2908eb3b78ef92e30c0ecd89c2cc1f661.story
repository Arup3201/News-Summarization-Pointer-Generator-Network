Britain has been struck by its second earthquake in just two days - this time beneath a sleepy East Midlands village.

The 3.8 magnitude earthquake hit the village of Cottesmore, near the market town of Oakham in Rutland, at 10.25pm last night and was felt by residents up to 60 miles away.

It came barely 24 hours after a 2.9 magnitude quake shook beds and rattled glasses in dining room cabinets in Hampshire's cathedral city of Winchester.

It is also the third earthquake to hit the area in less than 12 months, after two were recorded near Oakham in April last year.

The latest earthquake, which hit five miles underground, prompted more than 1,500 people to contact the British Geological Survey to say they had felt the tremor. 

'People have sent us pictures of things like chairs that fell over', said British Geological Survey spokesman Sarah Nice.

'It's not unusual to get one of this size in the UK - we have had them bigger. In fact, in the same area we had a 4.2 not too many years ago.

'When you get an earthquake you get quite a loud rumble and there might be a few chimney pots askew but it wouldn't be big enough to cause much damage.'

Residents took to Twitter to tell of their shock after realising an earthquake had struck. 

Sally Smart wrote: 'Earthquake wow that was a biggen!! Thought a truck was coming through the house #adrenalinepumping.'

Stuart Thomas added: 'Well that explains things falling off the wall'. 

A man called Ben wrote: 'How was there an earthquake in England? It's the end of the world.'

Another called Dirk wrote: 'Meanwhile on Facebook, people from my village, where the earthquake barely hit, are making sure they're all okay and prepared for the worst.'

Cottesmore is near to the market town of Oakham, which had two earthquakes in April last year 

Others posted photographs of framed pictures hanging on the walls slightly askew to show the aftermath of the earthquake. 

It comes after an earthquake hit Winchester yesterday with police receiving reports of something which 'felt like an explosion which shook their houses'.  

The quake is believed to have hit the Hampshire town at about 6.30pm at a depth of just over a mile, according to the BGS website.

A police spokesman said that no explanation or cause for the shaking could be found and no injuries had been reported. 

Several residents living within 60miles of the epicentre tweeted their surprise after feeling the tremor 

The BGS said it had received a report from a residents who said 'the whole bed was visibly shaking' as well as one who said the earthquake sounded 'like a bus' crashing 'into the neighbours house at speed'.

Another told the BGS: 'At least five other households ran outside to make sense of what had shook the houses.' 

Two earthquakes were also recorded near Oakham in April last year.

The first, on 17 April, 2014, measured 3.2 in magnitude, followed by a second tremor the following day, which measured 3.5 in magnitude.  

A spokesman for the British Army, which has a base near the latest quake's epicentre, said: 'The earthquake was felt at Kendrew Barracks, Cottesmore.

'There have been no reports of damage.' 

The tremor in Oakham came barely 24 hours after a 2.9 magnitude quake shook beds and rattled glasses in dining room cabinets in Hampshire's cathedral city of Winchester
