A study looking at hotel reviews by travellers has created a list of the best cities in the world for accommodation.

And some of the most-visited cities in the world, including Paris, New York and London, don't even feature in the top 25.

Lesser-known destinations such as Gdansk in Poland, Sofia in Bulgaria make it to the top of the list, with Cape Town, in South Africa, named the best city in the world for hotels.
