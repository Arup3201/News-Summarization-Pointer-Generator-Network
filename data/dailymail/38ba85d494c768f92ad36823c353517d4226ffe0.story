Alan Pardew believes Gabriel Obertan could emerge as a ‘bonus’ player for Newcastle this season despite being told he can leave the club.

The former Manchester United winger has endured a difficult three years on Tyneside, plagued by injury and poor form.

United had looked to offload the Frenchman this summer but, with no takers, he remains part of the first-team set-up.

Wing wizard: Gabriel Obertan will be hoping he can worm his way back into Alan Pardew's plans

Decision time: Pardew must decide whether to include Obertan in his first-team plans next season

And, speaking after Sunday’s 3-1 win over Schalke in which the Toon Army sang the winger's name, Pardew said: ‘I was really pleased with our fans. It was nice to hear them singing Obertan’s name.

‘He is another player that has worked hard this summer and you can see that.

‘If he can take that into the season that will be a bonus for us because he’s been troubled with injuries. He was very good (against Schalke).’

Meanwhile, Siem de Jong’s calf injury is not serious and he could return for next Sunday’s friendly with Real Sociedad.

Flop: Obertan failed to make an impact at Manchester United during his time at Old Trafford
