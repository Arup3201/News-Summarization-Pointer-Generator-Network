Kedra, who had been a member of the force since June 2012, was flown from the firing range by a medical helicopter, where a bullet was found to have pierced his chest, according to NBC 10.

His relatives were later seen crying as his body was placed into a hearse and escorted by a police motorcade to a nearby coroner's office.

'He died serving the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the men and women of the Pennsylvania State Police mourn his loss and extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends,' he said.
