Serge Gnabry says he is feeling 'better and better' all the time as the Arsenal teenager prepares to return after more than a year out.

The 19-year-old midfielder impressed for the Gunners last season, but his progress has been stunted by a serious knee injury.

Gnabry, as a result, has not featured since the Champions League last-16 second leg against Bayern Munich in March 2014, although he is at last closing in on a return.

The Germany Under-21 international played for Arsenal's development squad as they lost 1-0 to Reading on Monday and is now over his injury worries.

'I am feeling good, I'm feeling better and better,' Gnabry told Arsenal Media.

'It is my second 90 minutes [in the space of a week], I am playing and over my injury so it is all good and I am looking forward to the next game.'
