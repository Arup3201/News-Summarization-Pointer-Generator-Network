Aspiring actress: Emily Singleton, pictured, was found dead on the tracks at a Manhattan Subway station on Sunday afternoon

A woman who was found dead on the tracks at a Manhattan subway station on Sunday has been named as a 22-year-old theatre student who moved to New York in a bid to make her name on the stage.

Emily Singleton's body was found dead in a trough between the tracks at Canal Street station hours after she had been out drinking with friends.

Miss Singleton, a graduate from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, was in New York 'doing what she really wanted to do in life', according to her grandmother.

Janet Singleton, 85, told the New York Post that living in New York was a 'dream' of the aspiring actress originally from Downington, Pennsylvania.

She added: 'She just thought it was the more wonderful place to live.

'I talk to her every Thursday, and 
she was telling me . . . she was enjoying herself going to plays and 
different activities in the city.

'She realized the beginning of her dream, now, she’ll do it in heaven, I guess.'

Miss Singleton had been working in a clothes shop in the city to pay for acting classes.

She was last seen leaving a bar in 
Greenwich Village at around 1.30am on Sunday and boarding a train at a 
station in West 14th Street.

Her body was found around 12 hours later after being spotted by a passenger.

Although no formal cause of her death
has yet been confirmed, investigators believe that Miss Singleton may 
have stumbled onto the tracks and fatally hit her head.

Police sources said she was wearing leather trousers and high heels when she was found.

A passenger dialled 911 after seeing her on the southbound 1 line tracks. She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services. 

Liam Armstrong was killed on his 18th birthday as he crossed the tracks at 79th and Broadway

Miss Singleton's death comes less than two weeks after Liam Armstrong was killed by a No.2 express train on his 18th birthday.

Liam was hit by the train after he and two friends dared each other to cross the tracks at 79th and Broadway on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

His leg was severed and he died of severe head injuries, authorities said.

The three friends had mistakenly boarded a northbound No.1 train as they tried to make their way to Greenwich Village.

Instead of crossing the tracks above ground at 79th they dared each other to run across the tracks.

One friend had successfully reached the other side and another had yet to cross when Liam was hit.

On Saturday, a 50-year-old man also died after being hit by a train as he climbed down the tracks to pick something up.

He was hit by the southbound D train at the 72nd Street and Central Park West subway station.

Warning signs posted around the station warn people not to climb onto the tracks if they lose something.
