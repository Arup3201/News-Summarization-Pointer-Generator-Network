Hit movies and TV shows from the creators of Mickey Mouse, including box office hit Frozen, Cars, Monsters Inc. and UP, will be available to watch via the streaming service at a cost of $9.99 per month.

However, Netflix, would not be drawn on whether the new season (third) of drama Orange is The New Black, featuring Australian model Ruby Rose, will be part of the package when it launches in Australia and New Zealand on March 31.

'We have not made any announcements regarding Orange is the New Black for Australia and New Zealand at this time,' a Netflix spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.

Long running American series Lost will be part of the Disney deal with Netflix Australia

Animated and live-action films and shows from The Walt Disney Company’s extensive back catalogue will make up part of the subscription deal.

Long-running American series Lost, created by JJ Abrams, will be available as well as Marvel’s Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Saving Mr. Banks and Muppets Most Wanted.

In the months following launch, Netflix also will have streaming rights to Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent and Big Hero 6. 

‘As part of our long-standing global relationship with Disney, we're thrilled to bring fan favourites like Tangled and Star Wars: The Clone Wars to Netflix members in Australia and New Zealand,’ said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer of Netflix.

Muppets fans will be able to watch the antics of Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear, Animal and Walter in Muppets Most Wanted

The critically acclaimed tear-jerker UP from Disney will be available on Netflix Australia

The first hint that House of Cards was headed to Netflix Australia came when the new trailer was released advertising that season three will air via Netflix in the United States from February 27.

But when the Australian branch Netflix launches on its rumoured March 31 date, the show will be about a month behind.

Aside from Disney productions, other shows Netflix will have on offer when it launches in Australia include Marco Polo, Bojack Horseman and a Chelsea Handler comedy.

Rival streaming services Presto TV – from Foxtel and the Seven Network – and Stan – from Fairfax and Nine Entertainment – have already launched Down Under. 

Netflix's popular Orange Is The New Black is also in murky waters due to licensing agreements already in place with pay TV operator Foxtel

Netflix Australia describes another of its hits, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (which is written by Tina Fey) with the following: 'After living in a cult for fifteen years, Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) decides to reclaim her life and start over in New York City. Armed with just a backpack, light-up sneakers, and a couple of way-past-due library books, she’s ready to take on a world she didn’t even think existed anymore. Wide-eyed but resilient, nothing is going to stand in her way. She quickly finds a new job (working for 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski), a new roommate (Tituss Burgess, 30 Rock), and a new beginning.'

Marvel's Daredevil will debut on April 10. Blinded as a young boy but imbued with extraordinary senses, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) fights against injustice by day as a lawyer, and by night as the Super Hero “Daredevil” in modern day Hell's Kitchen, New York City.

Grace & Frankie features from May 08.

'In this irreverent series, Grace and Frankie are a pair of frenemies whose lives are turned upside down - and permanently intertwined - when their husbands leave them for each other. Together, they must face starting over in their 70s in a 21st Century world,' Netflix said in an official statement to Daily Mail Australia.

'And Sense8 is about 8 people connected all around the world who, after experiencing a violent vision, are able to see, feel, hear and talk to each other as if they are in the same place. Not only must these eight adapt to this new ability and to each other, they must figure out what happened and why and what it means for the future of humanity, while being hunted by an organisation out to capture, kill or vivisect them.'

Marvel film Captain America: The winter Soldier will be offered up by Netflix

Chris Hemsworth can be watched in Thor: The Dark World

In the months following launch, Netflix also will have streaming rights to Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy

Marco Polo is another series which the on demand service is confident of succeeding with.

'In a world replete with greed, betrayal, sexual intrigue and rivalry, Marco Polo, starring newcomer Lorenzo Richelmy, is based on the famed explorer’s adventures in Kublai Khan’s court in 13th century China.'

And there will be Bojack Horseman.

'Will Arnett voices BoJack, the failed legendary 90s sitcom star from the favourite family sitcom “Horsin’ Around,” who has been trying to find his way through a muddle of self-loathing, whisky and failed relationships. Now, in the presence of his human sidekick Todd (Aaron Paul) and his feline agent and ex-paramour Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris), BoJack is primed for his comeback.'

Hit movies like Cars and TV shows from the creators of Mickey Mouse will be available to watch via the streaming service at a cost of $9.99 per month

Monsters Inc. is one of Disney Pixar's hit animation movies 

Other confirmed shows on Netflix include Marco Polo, BoJack Horseman, Uganda Be Kidding Me, Live from Chelsea Handler, Bloodline, Daredevil, Sense8 and Grace and Frankie

The surprising backstory behind the making of Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks, will be on Netflix Australia

One its expected hits is likely to be Bloodline.

They say: 'When the eldest brother and black sheep (Ben Mendelsohn) of the Rayburn family returns home, he exposes the emotional demons that lie at the core of the family, threatening to tear them apart.'

Globally, Netflix has almost 60 million subscribers after launching back in 1997 as little more than a DVD mail order company.

There is also industry conjecture that Amazon is watching Netflix expansion into Australian and New Zealand and could soon make a decision on launching a rival service.
