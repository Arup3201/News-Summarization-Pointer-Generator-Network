At least one of the 'Tips For Jesus' do-gooders who have been leaving generous gratuities for restaurant staff across the country is former PayPal vice president Jack Selby, a waiter has claimed.

Aruj Dhuwan, a waiter at Bo's Kitchen, New York, said he was left a staggering tip of $1,000 dollars from a table he served late on Saturday night that included Mr Selby.

It was the third time the Tips For Jesus lightning had struck in the city in a single weekend.

God bless! The credit card slip including the massive $1,000 tip left for Bo's Kitchen water Aruj Dhuwan on Saturday night. He says it came from a group of diners including former PayPal executive Jack Selby

A worker at The Smith near Lincoln Center was left $3,500, while another at NoMad in the Flatiron District got $7,000.

It 
has previously been speculated that Mr Selby, who became a 
multimillionaire when PayPal was sold to eBay, was the person behind 
Tips For Jesus.

The 
39-year-old businessman is believed to have handed out tens of thousands
of dollars in tips in the past three months at cafes and clubs from 
Michigan to California.

Each kind gesture has been documented on the Instagram feed Tipsforjesus, which has the tagline, 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.'

But
there is now some speculation that there could be more than one big 
tipper involved, after pictures were posted to the Instagram account from 
New York and Mexico less than one day apart.

Posts on the Tips For Jesus Instagram feed show how a gratuity of 13,100 pesos was left for a waiter called Carlos at the restaurant at the Imanta resort near Puerto Vallarta on Friday.

Less than 24 hours later, Tips For Jesus had made another restaurant worker's night, this time at The Smith in New York City, with a tip of $3,500.

Mr Dhuwan said eccentric former PayPal
executive Mr Selby was part of a 'very well-dressed' party of three 
that had spent just $111.05 at Bo's Kitchen at about 11pm on Saturday 
night.

The 25-year-old told
the New York Post: 'As I was about to drop the check off, one of the 
men said they would "make my night." They called me over, gave me the 
check - I was amazed.

'They took a picture and literally, just like that, they walked out.'

The
bill had twice been stamped with the Instagram account name 
'@tipsforjesus' and a scrawled message said 'god bless', both trademarks
of the anonymous Tips For Jesus do-gooders.

Bo's manager, Benjamin Cramer, said 
that when he asked the 'gentleman' tipper why he had left such an 
extravagant bonus for staff, the man told him: 'Just because. We tip a 
hundred times the bill.'

Mr
Selby was among a small group of alumni who made a fortune at PayPal, 
and since leaving the firm has dabbled in film production, venture 
capitalism and now, according to his Facebook, he's opened a dry 
cleaning business.

While he hasn't officially revealed himself anywhere since the story went viral, he posted a link to an article about one generous gratuity on his page.

And his Facebook friends appear to be in on the charitable scheme.

One, Anne Woolway, commented: 'Do we win if we know whom is behind tipsforjesus?'

Another, Rob Hughes, added: 'and the mystery tipper strikes again...'

He also owns homes in all the states where tips were received, including multiple residences in Arizona and California. 

Last year, Mr Selby started a company Incognito Pictures with the aim to make movies for a budget of $10 million or less.

He secured $50million in financing for the project and entered into a long-term distribution deal with The Weinstein Company.

Tipsforjesus has left a trail of extremely happy servers across the country after dropping the ridiculously generous tips.

Selby earned a reputation for leaving extremely generous tips and Instagram-ing photos to prove it such as this one with a waitress who has just received $5,000

Little was known about Tipsforjesus bar an Instagram page until his identity was revealed Wednesday

Until now, little was known about the
mystery money man bar the Instagram page where a series of photographs 
have been posted since September of happy servers and receipts bearing 
gratuities with up to five figures.

Adding
up all the tips posted so far, Tips4jesus has handed out over $54,000 
to servers across the country in establishments including Tio's Mexican 
Cafe in Ann Arbor, the Paris Club in Chicago and the Hungry Cat in Los 
Angeles.

To begin with many people – especially waiters and waitresses - questioned the authenticity of the mega-tips which have so far ranged in size from $500 to $10,000.

But one lucky recipient came come forward to confirm that Tips4jesus is the real deal.

Robbie Schulz, co-owner of the Alley Bar in Ann Arbor, who was lucky enough to pick up a $7,000 tip for a $215 bar tab. 

Selby was also generous in Phoenix at the restaurant Crudo

Schulz recently confirmed to local blog 
Damn Arbor that the tip was real and that he served the mysterious 
Tip4jesus in September when he and his entourage were in town for the 
Notre Dame versus Michigan game.

According to Schulz, the Tips4jesus crew found themselves at his bar at 1:45am after a couple of other places had turned them away.

He described Tips4jesus as friendly, polite, nice and a pleasure to serve and that he was told he would be taken care of the staff at the end of the night.

Schultz had expectations that perhaps a $50 tip might be in the offing, but was flabbergasted when Tips4jesus reached for his black American Express card and tipped an amazing $7,000.

A black AMEX card was a sure sign that the customer was going to be good for massive tip as the exclusive card is by invitation only and
the average cardholder has $16.3 million in assets and a household 
income of $1.3 million.

It's every server's dream to have some super generous customer leave an enormous tip for a job well done and one bartender came forward to confirm that Tipsforjesus was the real deal

At Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tipsforjesus, or Selby, left a $10,000 tip - over two receipts - which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud

According to Schultz, Tips4jesus promised him that the amount was 100 per cent legit and he was good for the amount. He even returned the next day to buy some T-shirts and take the picture that appears on the Instagram account.

After the tip cleared Schultz very generously distributed the money amongst the staff who worked that night, in addition to at least one employee who had the night off. 

But not everyone has been so fortunate with getting their windfall.

At a bar called Legends Of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, Tips4jesus left a $10,000 which wasn't cleared because of concerns about fraud, reports the South Bend Tribune.

When the server noted that the tip didn't go through, Tips4jesus replied with a vow to ensure that the charge had been approved and followed that up with a photo of the Amex statement to prove it.

Tips4jesus' further offered to help the server, posting, 'Nobody is going to ruin the good were trying to do.'
