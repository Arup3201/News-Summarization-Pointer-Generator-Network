Offensive: ITV reporter Richard Pallot twice referred to black footballers as 'coloured'

ITV news producers have been given a reprimand after they allowed a reporter to use the word 'coloured' to describe soccer players and coaches.

The word was used during a lunchtime news bulletin on February 26 about Prime Minister David Cameron hosting a summit on tackling racism in sport.

Twenty viewers complained to ITV and four to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom after the gaffe on the ITV1 programme.

ITV executives quickly apologised on Twitter, edited the word from the news report and removed the word from the report that appeared on the ITV News website.

They gave warnings about use of the word to the producer, programme editor and reporter.

Now, as a result of this, Ofcom has decided to take no action.

It said: 'We noted that ITV recognised the editorial mistake almost immediately after broadcast, and took swift and appropriate action to mitigate the potential for further offence.'

The industry watchdog said executives edited the report before it was repeated on the ITV1 Plus One service and apologised in the press, on Twitter and to the viewers that complained to them.

It added: 'On balance, and in light of the steps taken by ITV to mitigate this offence, Ofcom therefore considered the matter resolved.'

Richard Pallot, who reportedly earns £40,000 a show, said 'coloured' twice during the ITV programme as he talked about racism in the game.

'Football has certainly come a long way since bananas were routinely thrown at coloured players,' Pallot reported.

'But one shameful statistic remains - only three of the 92 League clubs employ a black manager, and one of those Keith Curl, was only appointed at Notts County a few days ago.

'The Government are funding a scheme to promote more coloured coaches and are also tackling the issue of homophobia in the sport.'

Using the term 'coloured' to refer to black people is considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same.

The term was in widespread use in Britain in the 1960s but is now considered racist.

The problem is it suggests white people are white and everyone else is 'coloured'. There is no recognition that everyone has their own ethnic origin.

Alan Hansen sparked a row by using the term last year on the day that John Terry was charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. He denies the offence

After Mr Pallot used the same term, one Twitter user wrote to ITV: 'When was it okay to use the word coloured? And to make it worse is that you were talking about racism!'

An ITV spokesman said: 'The reporter’s use of the term ‘coloured’ was inappropriate and we do not defend its use.

'It was an editorial misjudgement and we apologise to those who were understandably offended by the use of this term.'

He said that, although the report had been produced against a tight deadline 'we ccept that this does not excuse the mistake being made ... and understand the careful selection of appropriate language around the issues of race.'

It said the report was reviewed before it was transmitted, but the word coloured was not spotted because of 'human error and editorial misjudgement'.

The spokesman added: 'The reporter, producer and programme editor have all been made aware of the gravity of the error and the incident will feature in future newsroom compliance training.'

Following the blunder David Cameron said in Parliament that there were 'worrying' signs that racism is creeping back into football.
