Rude, unapologetic and very funny, Mark Wright's female co-host of Take Me Out: The Gossip steps in to help Emily Hartridge present this week's 10 Reasons Why video.

Viewers might also recognise presenter Zoe Hardman, 30, from shows like Nuts TV and This Morning's Hub.

But this week she takes a break to present a light-hearted take on why women are weird along with YouTube blogger Emily Hartridge, 29.

Why Women Are Weird: 'Two kisses yesterday, one kiss today - he is definitely seeing someone else!'

Zoe requested the opportunity to work with Emily after seeing her fellow Hub presenter Matt Johnson on last week's episode, all about the perks of the spring season.

The double act used to present together and now execute a hilarious rendition of 10 Reasons Why ... Women Are Weird.

Emily and Zoe act out what women say to their boyfriends and how that differs from what they are really thinking. For instance, if she says she 'doesn't mind 
at all' if you go out somewhere she disapproves of, she's probably 
thinking: 'If you go I'll break your legs.'

Zoe acts out a comic scene where she says: 'I love being tied up! It was totally fine.' when she's really thinking: 'Oh my god I thought I was going to die.'

Here, Emily goes mad at Zoe for wearing the same shirt as her - something, they say, that wouldn't happen if two male friends were wearing the same top.

If men go out with their male friends, Emily says, and don't text their girlfriend every five minutes, they're obviously having a lap dance.

Zoe Hardman then paces up and down the living room as Emily reads a magazine, frantically cursing that her man must be interfering with a stripper if he hasn't texted her in four minutes.

Emily observes her almost wrinkle-free face in a compact declaring her interest in using hemorrhoid cream to get rid of her eye bags.

Zoe looks disgusted at the prospect.

Women, Emily says, will do anything to make themselves look younger. Which is 'pretty weird'

While Emily says she doesn't find going to the toilet a particularly scary thing, for some reason she likes to go with a friend.

Assuming this is in order not to eat the stuff, Emily confesses she is a fan of sniffing chocolate.

With this she suggests all women are fans of the practice. 'I've already sniffed chocolate this morning,' she says.

Zoe doesn't find it so normal that Emily is a fan of sniffing chocolate. Another weird habit

'Honey I've got a really bad headache,' says Emily, head perched on a pillow in bed.

Her excuse for avoiding sex, when flipped on its head, is greeted with a hostile response. 'Why don't you just tell me you're cheating on me,' she shouts.

Before laying into Reason Eight, Emily stresses that she holds no responsibility for the sexist undertone, a male friend had shared with her his squabbles with the female sex: 'Why can't women learn to use their new iPhone, TV or laptop rather than trying for one minute and passing it over for me to fix.'

Zoe presents this one with conviction.

'I don't know what you're talking about. I have never farted in my life, that's disgusting,' she confesses to the camera.

Then
we are taken to a bathroom scene where she seems to be in the middle of
demonstrating that she does, in fact, suffer from wind. Despite her 
denial.

'I don't know what you're talking about. I have never farted in my life, that's disgusting,' she insists

The video montage shows Emily and Zoe crying at inanimate objects such as a sea shell and an iron. Zoe laughs uncontrollably for no specific reason while doing the washing up, demonstrating how women are mysterious, confusing, weird creatures.
