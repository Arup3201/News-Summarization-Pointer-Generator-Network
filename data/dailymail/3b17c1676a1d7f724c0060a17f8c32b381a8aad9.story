Tens of thousands of people could be helped to buy newly-built homes worth up to £500,000 after the Government said it would use £1billion of taxpayers’ money to ensure they get mortgages with just a 5 per cent deposit.

Prime Minister David Cameron today launched a scheme that is designed to guarantee risky mortgages for all home buyers in a bid to kickstart the flagging property market.

The move heralds the return of 5 per cent deposits rather than the 20 per cent typically demanded by lenders since the credit crunch. It could save buyers £34,000 on the average house.

But MPs were warned that the NewBuy scheme, which could allow people to put as little equity as £11,000 into a £228,000 house, could spark another credit crisis.

Help: David Cameron, seen meeting aspiring home owners today, launched the NewBuy Scheme to enable such couples to buy homes with a deposit of 5 per cent, rather than the 20% figure most have to find

Labour MP David Crausby said that by 
allowing  may reinflate the housing bubble which burst at the start of 
the financial crisis.

Once again this could lead to banks 
repossessing homes and families being forced from their houses as they 
failed to make repayments, the member for Bolton North East said.

During a Commons debate, he said: 
'While we all want house building to get moving again and get first-time
 buyers on the housing ladder, is it not true that 95% mortgages and 
even higher were what went wrong with the housing market in the first 
place?

'Won't any attempt to artificially prop up house building with Government subsidy just come back and bite us?'

Laura and John Concanon are typical of thousands of homeowners who find themselves unable to move up the housing ladder.

The
 couple, pictured below, bought their two-bedroom terrace home in Epping, Essex, in 
August 2007, and while they have been happy there, Laura, 33, a vet, and
 John, 34, a civil servant, would like more room for a growing family.

They have a son, 22-month-old Finn, as well as a dog and a cat. 

Laura
 says: ‘We paid just under £250,000 for this house, but similar 
properties are on the market for about £230,000 to £235,000.

‘When
 you factor in moving costs and how much we’d have to pay to move up to a
 three-bedroom home, even in a cheaper area, we’d need to have a deposit
 and moving fund of about £50,000. And at the moment, saving that sort 
of sum is completely out of our reach.’

Hollingworth
 says: ‘If you are stuck in this position, your first step should be to 
talk to your present lender and see what it might be prepared to do.’

Some
 lenders might relax their borrowing limits slightly if they are dealing
 with a customer who has a good record of repayments. Others have a 
range of incentives aimed at trapped homeowners.

Lloyds
 runs an equity support scheme for existing borrowers, including those 
with Halifax and Cheltenham & Gloucester mortgages.

Under the NewBuy scheme, which is 
open to aspiring as well as actual home owners, the Government will 
stump up 5.5 per cent of the value of a mortgage on a home worth up to 
£500,000.

And the housebuilder will put up 3.5 
per cent to help guarantee mortgage lenders against any losses and 
stimulate a wave of fresh lending.

Buyers would still be required to 
come up with the 5 per cent deposit and pay off the full loan in time - 
worth up to 95 per cent of the value of their home.

But if they defaulted, the house builders' and Government's money would be kept by the lender.

Barclays,
 Nationwide Building Society and NatWest Home Loans said they are ready 
to start lending under the scheme, while Santander aims to make products
 available by the middle of the year and Halifax is expected to follow 
suit.

Barratt Developments 
said the scheme is already proving popular and nearly 20,000 people have
 registered interest on its website.

Currently, most prospective buyers 
are expected to have saved twice their annual income to have enough cash
 to put down a 20 per cent deposit -worth £45,665 on an average £228,385
 house.

But, if lenders will provide a mortgage with a 5 per cent deposit, they would only need to have saved £11,419.

However, the project, which could help up to 100,000 people, has been derided by 
critics as a gimmick that will help the construction industry rather 
than struggling home buyers.

They say such deals are pointless 
unless they are cheaper than other 95 per cent mortgage offers that are -
 despite most deals vanishing after the  credit crunch - open to some 
bank customers.

Dominik Lipnicki, of Your Mortgage Decisions, said: 'You can already 
  obtain 95 per cent mortgages with comparable interest rates of 5 per cent plus.

'It's more of a gimmick. It's a great headline and it will help some but 
  mainly the construction industry.

'All this will do is encourage people to 
  buy new properties but old property won't be sold and the chain will stop.'

Also, there are fears that a 
widespread return to home buyers requiring only 5 per cent deposits 
could trigger another crash if currently low interest rates were to rise
 significantly.

Before the credit crunch, loans of up to 125 per cent of home value were possible.

Jonathan Samuels, 
CEO of Dragonfly Property Finance, said: ‘The Government's NewBuy 
guarantee scheme, like many such schemes over the years, smacks of 
desperation.

‘The property market will come back when it is ready to come back and schemes like this are mere tinkering around the edges.

‘If the Government thinks this scheme will kickstart the property market then it is in Cloud Cuckoo Land.

‘The concern is that NewBuy is intrinsically leveraged, and we know where leveraging got us in the past.

‘People should buy when they are genuinely in a robust position to do so, not because a bank says they can buy.’

Housing minister Grant Shapps said criteria for lending were much stricter since the credit crisis.
He added: 'The problem was sub-prime lending, not 95 per cent mortgages, which operated perfectly well in this country for many decades.
'The problem was lending to people who simply couldn't afford to pay back the mortgages.'

Separately,
 two million occupants of social housing will be offered subsidies of up
 to £75,000 in the biggest extension of Margaret Thatcher’s flagship 
right-to-buy policy for decades.

Ministers say that for every home 
sold, the Government will provide a new ‘affordable’ home, the majority 
of which are expected to be newly built.

As well as helping buyers to get into 
the market, the scheme is intended to support 50,000 jobs in 
construction and related industries.

The Prime Minister said: ‘Strong 
families and stable communities are built from good homes. That’s why I 
want us to build more homes and I want more people to have the chance to
 own their own home.

‘We are acting today across the board to make this happen.

‘We’re re-booting the right to buy scheme to increase discounts for two million tenants in social housing in England.

‘And we’re delivering on our promise 
to offer affordable mortgages to buyers who might otherwise not be able 
to raise the money to buy a newly-built home. It’s no good hoping people
 will climb the property ladder if the bottom rung is missing. 
Affordable properties and available mortgages are vital.’

Chancellor George Osborne will use his
 Budget later this month to signal a major housebuilding programme, with
 plans for around 500,000 new homes and a relaxation of planning laws.

The right-to-buy scheme was 
introduced by Baroness Thatcher in 1980, but Labour put the brakes on 
the programme when it came to power.

Currently right-to-buy 
discounts are capped at £16,000 in most of London, and £38,000 in other 
parts of the country. Under the Government’s plans, they are expected to
 be doubled.

Currently, banks are reluctant to lend more than 75 per cent of a property’s value,
 so the Government has had to underwrite the risk to persuade them to 
take part.

Following in her footsteps:  David Cameron has pledged to 'reboot' Margaret Thatcher's right-to-buy scheme by offering council tenants discounts of up to £75,000

But under the NewBuy scheme, the deals mean that rather than typical buyers saving a £40,000 deposit, they will now only need £10,000.

Jack
 Dromey, Labour’s shadow housing minister, said: ‘Today’s announcement 
is too little too late, but at least it’s something from a Government 
that has done virtually nothing to tackle the worst housing crisis in a 
generation.’
