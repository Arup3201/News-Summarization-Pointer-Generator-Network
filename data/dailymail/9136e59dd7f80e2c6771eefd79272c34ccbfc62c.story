Pierre Barnes, 12, pictured here with his parents, was on holiday and went missing after going for a bike ride around the island on his own yesterday afternoon.

Pierre Barnes, 12, set off for the ride on Saturday afternoon, the first day of a half-term holiday.

His bike was later discovered near a coastal path with its chain off.

Close by lay a single shoe believed to have belonged to him, according to reports.

Yesterday search and rescue teams on Porquerolles, near the port city of Toulon on France’s south coast, had to contend with 80mph winds and 20ft waves battering the Mediterranean island.

Pierre’s father, Stephen, is English and his mother Florence, 43, is a teacher who grew up near Paris.

In an interview with  French TV Mr Barnes, a property developer from Grantham in  Lincolnshire, spoke of his hopes that his son was still alive.

He said: ‘I am certain he went off on an adventure on his bicycle. but in the forest all the little tracks look the same.

‘He
is lost but he is a strong boy and I hope he found a place to sleep 
where there was not too much wind. It’s difficult to say what you can do
when you are cold and frightened.’

Mr
Barnes, 57, thanked islanders for turning out to search for Pierre as 
well as more than 100 firemen and gendarmes, many from the mainland.

The island, which is four-miles long and two-miles wide, is a  popular holiday destination.

Pierre
has two sisters – Zoe, 17, and Clemence, 13, and a brother Desmond, 15.
The family were due to stay on the island for a week.

They had just begun a week’s holiday on the island.

Emergency services were alerted and 
began a search of the island and the sea at 9pm, continuing until 5am 
when extreme weather conditions forced them to call a temporary halt.

Their efforts were hampered by poor visibility, rough sea conditions and winds gusting up to 80 miles per hour.
