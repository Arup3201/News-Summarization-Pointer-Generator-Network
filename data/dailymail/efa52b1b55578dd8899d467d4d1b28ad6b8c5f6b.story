A teenage German foreign exchange student who was shot dead by a Montana homeowner when he wandered into his garage was apparently looking for alcohol, authorities have said.

According to court records made public on Monday, Diren Dede, 17, and Ecuadorian foreign exchange student Robby Pazmino were out walking in the Missoula neighborhood when Dede entered Markus Kaarma's garage on April 27.

Pazmino told police he thought Dede was looking for alcohol.

Mr Kaarma and his girlfriend said they had 
been burgled twice in the three weeks before the shooting. Kaarma 
allegedly told a hairdresser several days prior that he was waiting up 
to kill the intruders, whom he referred to as 'kids,' according to court
 documents.

He faces one count of deliberate homicide.

Pazmino
 also informed police that they had learned about 'garage hopping' or 
'garage shopping' from local friends and had participated with other 
friends three or four times in the past. But he denied taking any items 
from Mr Kaarma's garage, the affidavit stated.

Normally, he said, he 
and Dede opted to stay in the car while other local teenagers searched 
for alcohol inside people's garages.

Markus Kaarma and his partner Janelle Pflager allegedly set a trap in their garage for Dede, leaving the door open with a purse in plain view and trip wires to alert them to his presence

Mr Kaarma told authorities he 
heard a metallic noise the night of the shooting, panicked and opened 
fire into the darkened garage. Authorities say he fired blindly, 
'sweeping the interior of the garage to the left with a total of four 
rounds.'

Dede was hit twice, once in the arm and once in the head.

A
 court document last week disclosed that Missoula police received a 
judge's permission to test whether Mr Kaarma was drunk or high when he 
shot and killed Dede. Officers reportedly found a jar of marijuana in Mr
 Kaarma's home the day he shot Dede, a police statement accompanying an 
April 28 request for a search warrant said.

Police believe Kaarma 
'may have been impaired by alcohol, dangerous drugs, other drugs, 
intoxicating substances or a combination of the above, at the time of 
the incident,' the statement from Detective Dean Chrestenson said.

District Judge Karen Townsend granted the warrant to draw Mr Kaarma's blood to test whether any traces of intoxicants remained.

Prosecutors
 allege Mr Kaarma and his common-law wife set up sensors and a video 
monitor, then left their garage door open the night of the shooting in 
Missoula.

Earlier 
this month, more than 500 people attended a memorial service at a mosque
 in Hamburg to bid him farewell. Dede, the son of Turkish immigrants, 
was a junior at Big Sky High School.

The coffin of Diren Dede is carried during his funeral in Hamburg on May 4. More than 500 people came to pay their respects
