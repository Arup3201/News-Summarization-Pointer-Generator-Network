Scotland coach Grant Bradburn has confirmed Preston Mommsen will captain the side at next year's ICC Cricket World Cup.

The Saltires chief has also announced Kyle Coetzer will be vice-captain for the tournament, which gets underway on February 14 in Australia and New Zealand.

Mommsen played a pivotal role as Scotland clinched their place in competition. The 27-year-old put in an impressive display during the World Cup qualification tournament, staged in New Zealand last January, as he scored 520 runs in eight innings on his way to being named Player of the Tournament.

Preston Mommsen has been in impressive form for Scotland and was named associate player of the year

He has compiled 684 runs after 26 one-day internationals with an average of 31.09. His highest score of 139 came against the UAE in the final of the qualifying tournament.

His leadership skills also played a part as Mommsen was named as the 2014 ICC Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year.

He takes over the captaincy duties on a permanent basis from Northamptonshire's Coetzer, who skippered the side for most of the last two years.

Mommsen said: 'It's a huge honour to be leading the Scotland team into the 2015 Cricket World Cup. This group of players have been together for a couple of years now, and this has always been the dream.

'It's an exciting time for everyone involved in Scottish cricket and hopefully our performances in Australia and New Zealand will help promote the game, and inspire the next generation in Scotland.'

Mommsen will lead Scotland at the World Cup where they will play six times, including against England

Bradburn added: 'We have a strong squad line-up and excellent leaders in Preston and Kyle, as we prepare to play some international cricketing giants on the world stage next February in New Zealand.

'We don't underestimate the challenge but we have been training hard and will be bringing our absolute best to this hugely important global event.'

Scotland will play at least six matches during the tournament, opening their Pool A campaign with a sold-out clash against co-hosts New Zealand in Dunedin on February 17. England are next up in Christchurch on February 23 before the Scots return to Dunedin three days later to face Afghanistan.

Bangladesh will provide the opposition in Nelson on March 5, with Sri Lanka next on the schedule on March 11 in Hobart, the same venue for their final group game against Australia on March 14.
