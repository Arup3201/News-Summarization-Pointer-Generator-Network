A man shot himself dead outside a police station in North Yorkshire yesterday.

The man, believed to be in his 60s, drove into the car park and shot himself in the head in front of shocked staff at Harrogate police station.

Officers ran out from behind the front desk but could do nothing to help the victim, whose identity has yet to be confirmed.

Shot: The man drove into the visitor's car park outside Harrogate police station in North Yorkshire and shot himself in front of helpless staff yesterday afternoon

The man drove a Renault into the visitors car park at 4.20pm Saturday and committed suicide without warning.

A
North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘Officers are currently 
investigating the circumstances surrounding the man’s death, however 
they do not believe that is was suspicious.

Police confirmed that a firearm was recovered from the scene, but that nobody else is being sought in connection with the incident.

After
the shooting the police station was closed to the public as a forensic 
team investigated the victim's car and the surrounding area.

Incident: One firearm was recovered from the scene and police in Harrogate are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

The incident happened just yards from the main entrance of the state-of-the-art £18million police station which opened last May.

The police station is located outside the town centre, close to the Harlow Carr Gardens where hundreds of visitors had spent the day.

Last night, both public entrances to the station in east Harrogate were sealed off by a police car and van.

The man’s body was removed from the car park around 7pm last night.
