Jenny Winder, head teacher at Elstow School near Bedford, who is under fire for booking a Caribbean holiday during term time 

An under fire headmistress has refused to apologise for arranging a Caribbean holiday during term time saying her 'private life is private'.

Last week it emerged that Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow School, a primary school near Bedford, is taking a week off after the Christmas holidays for the break even though it will be the start of the school term.

This is despite parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences, with Mrs Winder being described as a 'hypocrite' for booking the holiday.

But now the head, who has been in charge of the school for 14 years, has refused to give an explanation or apologise for taking time off. 

She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.'

The website for the school, which caters for four to 11-year-olds reminds parents  to book breaks ‘only in holiday time’ and encourages pupils to achieve ‘highest possible levels of attendance’.

It adds that the school 'will not authorise' such absences and parents are fined £60 per parent per child per period of absence, which rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

However, chair of governors Kevin Hunter defended Mrs Winder's holiday and said: 'She made what we have judged to be a request for a week off during term time for personal reasons which we have judged appropriate.'

He added that Mrs Winder was 'devoted, well-liked, extremely hardworking and effective' but would not say why she was granted the leave. 

Bedford Borough Council said term-time leave for teachers was 'at the discretion' of governors.

A spokesman said the head told the council she had never previously taken holiday during term time during her 14 years at the school.

However, an insider told a local newspaper: 'Mr Hunter told the governors he … had agreed it and that they had to pass it … Three governors have since resigned, stating other reasons … the chairman now needs to take responsibility and resign himself.' 

In its last Ofsted inspection in 2009, Elstow School was rated as outstanding and Mrs Winder  is thought to be paid around £45,000 a year.

On her Friends Reunited page, she describes herself as a former PE teacher now ‘too old, fat and unfit’ to teach the subject so has become a head instead. 

The mother-of-one, who is separated from her son’s father, is understood to be travelling to the Caribbean, where average daytime temperatures in January are around 28C, with her partner. 

However, one parent of children at the school said: 'Mrs Winder is taking a week off in the New Year after the children have gone back. 

'This is so unfair as teachers already get so many holidays and yet we wouldn't be allowed to take our children out of school for even a day.' 

Some parents, whose children attend the school, pictured, have branded Mrs Winder 'a hypocrite' for booking the holiday 

Another branded the decision as 'disgusting' and added: 'I've been fined twice for taking my children out of school and I put in a request to take them out next year and it's been refused.

'I think she should either give us an explanation why she is taking time off or at least grant people holiday to do it themselves.'

Another mother, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is disgraceful. [Mrs Winder] is a hypocrite. We can’t take holidays in term-time so why should she? The school is fast enough threatening parents with fines if they take their children out.’ 

It comes after families were told they were only allowed to take children out of school in ‘exceptional circumstances’ under measures brought in by the last Education Secretary, Michael Gove.

Previously, heads had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days’ leave each year.

Parents wanted the flexibility of term-time holidays to avoid the punishing premiums holiday firms add in peak periods.

Parents who have branded Mrs Winder a 'hypocrite' for taking a holiday during school time have pointed to new measures, which mean they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday.

Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year.

However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail.

Now they face a £60 fine each for every child who fails to attend school without permission – meaning a two-parent two-child family would be charged £240.

Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, jailed for up to three months and fined £2,500.

In the Bedford Borough Council area, where Elstow School is located, 432 parents were issued with a fixed penalty notice for taking their children out of school, when their absence was not authorised between September 2013 and July 2014.

This compares to just 39 fixed penalty notices, which were issued between September 2012 and July 2013.  

Earlier this year, one of the first couples to be prosecuted for taking their family on holiday during term time were Stewart and Natasha Sutherland from Shropshire.

The couple took their three children Keane, six, Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, to the Greek island of Rhodes last September.

Mr Sutherland, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service said at the time that it was the first family holiday in five years as the couple had struggled to get time off work together. 

After refusing to pay the fines, they were prosecuted at Telford Magistrates Court and fined £630.

Speaking at the time Mr Sutherland said: 'I know education is important but there's a bigger picture. Family time is important too.'

It has been estimated that more than 24,000 children skip school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price hikes.
