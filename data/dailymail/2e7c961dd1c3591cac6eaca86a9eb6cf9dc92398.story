Arjen Robben has been the outstanding player of the tournament for me so far, and not for the first time I’ve being thinking ‘If only...’ about the missed opportunity Manchester United had to sign him when he was young.

I was at the Dutch team’s hotel the other day after they’d beaten Australia 3-2, to have a coffee with Robben, Robin Van Persie and Nigel De Jong and it was so refreshing to see the enthusiasm — pure delight — flowing through that group.

Robben has scored three goals in two games and RVP and De Jong were waxing lyrical about his stats, not least the fact that he’s hitting more than 30kph with the ball still under control — then smashing it home after running half the pitch.

I know there are fans out there who assume that top players take things for granted, including their wages, their status, their place at these big occasions, even success. In most cases I can tell you: rubbish.

Footballers are just the same as any fan. We grow up daydreaming of one day playing, perhaps scoring, at a World Cup. I’m sure you’ve imagined it. And when it happens? ‘It’s still that dream come true,’ Robben told me the other day. Believe me, he’s living the dream.

He should have been a United player. He would have fitted in. He had a brilliant breakthrough season with PSV in 2002-03, a campaign in which he turned 19, and Sir Alex Ferguson wanted to sign him.

United made a bid of something around £5million, and Sir Alex was always determined he wouldn’t over-pay for any player. When that was rejected, Chelsea paid something like £12m.

The whole Dutch squad seem extraordinarily positive. The difference in RVP, who often wasn’t happy last season, is amazing. They believe in their manager, Louis Van Gaal. If he tells them the sun is black and the grass is blue, they believe it!

Ruud Gullit was telling me how much fun they’re having too — and it’s down to their manager. I’ve often felt Robben was one who got away from United, and never more than now.

To celebrate the World Cup, I've added a special Unity Cap to my fashion range, incorporating all the flags of the participating nations and and with a share of the proceeds going to charity.
