A top National Rifle Association official in New York has been banned from carrying a gun after harassing his ex-wife.

Richard D'Alauro, a representative of the pro-firearm NRA for the city, can no longer own or buy guns because of an order of protection made after a domestic incident with his wife at their Long Island home.

Suffolk County authorities filed a noncriminal charge of harassment as a result of the confrontation, which took place in September 2010.

Richard D'Alauro, a representative of the NRA, was forced to hand over his 39-gun arsenal to police after admitting to harassing his ex-wife. File picture

Police were forced to make two trips to confiscate the 62-year-old's arsenal of 39 pistols, shotguns and rifles, Maribeth D’Alauro, who has since divorced her husband, told the New York Daily News.

A transcript of the proceedings, which took place in October at Suffolk County Court, show the NRA official admitted to the harassment charge and admitted that he intended to 'harass, annoy or alarm' his wife'by subjecting her to physical contact'.

Under federal and state law, convicted domestic abusers are forbidden from purchasing firearms and he can no longer buy or own firearms until October this year, when his guns will be returned.

His ex-wife, who walks with a cane 
and has multiple sclerosis says she finds the prospect of him being 
allowed to re-arm is frightening.

D'Alauro's ex-wife's lawyer said: 'A man who has an order of protection against him ... is a poor spokesman for the NRA'

Her attorney Sari Friedman said, 'A man who has an order of protection against him ... is a poor spokesman for the NRA.'

She added that he uses the NRA's confrontational tactics when dealing with her at home.

'They are cut from the same cloth,' she said.

D’Alauro declined to comment, but his lawyer, John Ray, said the initial charges against the NRA official were 'absurd' and that's the reason D'Alauro was given a noncriminal violation.

He added that it is of 'no significance whatsoever' that D’Alauro can’t own or possess a gun and work for the NRA

'The NRA does not require its employees to own guns,' he said.

The lawyer added that the NRA official had a vast arsenal of guns because he is a collector. The NRA did not comment.
