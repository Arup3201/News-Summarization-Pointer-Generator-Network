President Barack Obama has revealed the US has seen evidence of chemical weapons being used in Syria.

His announcement comes as Russia sends in advanced missiles to Syria in a move that highlights the depth of its support for President Bashar al-Assad.

Following a meeting with Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Obama insisted it 
was important to get more specific details about alleged chemical 
attacks.

Declaration: President Barack Obama has said the US has seen evidence of chemical weapons being used in Syria. Following a meeting with Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Mr Obama insisted it was important to get more specific details

Last year Obama and Western leaders warned Syria that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line.'

If the latest claims are correct it could lead to greater Western military involvement in the two-year war, and Mr Obama emphasized yesterday that a whole range of diplomatic and military options were available.

'Our militaries are constantly sharing information. We have seen evidence of the use of chemical weapons inside Syria,' he said.

Tension: Russian Navy's anti-aircraft ship Admiral Panteleyev is moored during a port call today in Limassol, Cyprus

Conflict: A group of warships from Russia's Pacific Fleet entered the Mediterranean waters for the first time in decades, in a period of high tension over the Syrian conflict

Support: Russia is a main supporter of the Syrian President's regime

'Those chemical weapons inside of Syria also threaten our security over the long term as well as [that of] our allies and friends and neighbours.'

However, he added that 'more specific information' was needed.

Obama emphasized U.S. involvement in delivering 'food, shelter and medicine that is needed to save lives' as Turkey shields Syrian refugees.

He also stressed the need for a Syrian future without its current dictator.

'We both agree that Bashar as-Assad needs to go,' Obama said, referring to Erdogan standing beside him.

Meanwhile Russia has sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syria, American officials said yesterday.

Russian
President Vladimr Putin remains opposed to the overthrow of Assad 
despite talks with Prime Minster David Cameron last week.

Although Russia has previously provided missiles, these ones are thought to be more effective.

'It
enables the regime to deter foreign forces looking to supply the 
opposition from the sea, or from undertaking a more active role if a 
no-fly zone or shipping embargo were to be declared at some point,' said
Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane’s International Defense Review 
told the New York Times.

Delivery: In 2007 Russia signed the deal to send a Yakhont missile to Syria

Opposed: Russian President Vladimr Putin remains opposed to the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad

Russia has previously blocked international moves through the UN security council to impose sanctions on Syria.

Yesterday news emerged that eyewitnesses and victims are claiming that government helicopters 
have dropped at least two devices containing poisonous gas on the town of 
Syrian town of Saraqeb.

Doctors say one woman died and seven others suffered side 
effects, according to the BBC. 

Intelligence gleaned by both the UK 
and US indicated there is evidence that the increasingly beleaguered 
regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad had used the weapons and in 
particular the devastating nerve agent sarin, officials said

Last
month two Syrian officials denied the government has used chemical
weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them.

Injured:
A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a 
Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use 
of sarin gas last month 

Syrian official Sharif Shehadeh 
called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them to false accusations that
Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the U.S. invasion 
of that country.

The CIA 
believes Syria has had a chemical weapons programme for years. There is 
grave concern in the UK and US that its stockpile of chemical weapons – 
approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into the hands
of Al Qaeda to be turned on Western targets.

Last
month a video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor 
appeared to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at
the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons 
attack.

Witnesses said that containers were dropped from an aircraft and scattered their contents across the area.

The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims.

He
said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including 
foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing.

They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims.

Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo.

UK
Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last month that a soil sample 
taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

A U.N. plan for a chemical weapons 
investigation has been blocked because Assad's government has refused to
grant an international inspection team unfettered access in the 
country.

The government wants the team to inspect only Aleppo and not 
Homs, both sites of alleged chemical weapons attacks that the rebels and
government accuse each other of perpetrating.

The Syrian conflict started with 
peaceful protests in March 2011, but when these were suppressed it 
gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which, 
according to one opposition monitoring group, has cost more than 80,000 
lives.
