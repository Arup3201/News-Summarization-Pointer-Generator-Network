Hundreds of companies are being helped to avoid tax ‘on an industrial scale’ by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, a report by MPs will warn today.

Executives at PwC will also be accused of misleading Parliament about their activities when they insisted two years ago they did not sell tax avoidance products.

MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said leaked internal letters exposing PwC’s dealings with 343 firms show the firm clearly did ‘mass market’ schemes for companies to divert profits to Luxembourg.

Committee chairman Margaret Hodge, who worked at PwC from 1992-94, said that the firm's clients do not have to demonstrate that they run any operations in the tax haven to use this tactic.

One firm advised by PwC, Shire Pharmaceuticals, used such a scheme to pay just 0.016 per cent tax on its profits in Luxembourg.

Shire, which is incorporated in Jersey and has most of its 5,600 staff in the US and Britain, based just two employees there – one of whom was also a registered director of 41 companies.

It set up a subsidiary in the country which lent its main operation £10billion. Interest payments on this loan reduced the tax burden in Britain significantly and PwC negotiated with authorities in Luxembourg to pay almost no tax there.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘It is only right that companies pay their fair share of tax according to the profits they make from their economic activity in the countries in which they do business.

MP Margaret Hodge said PwC's activities represented 'the promotion of tax avoidance on an industrial scale'

‘We believe that PwC’s activities represent nothing short of the promotion of tax avoidance on an industrial scale.

‘Contrary to its denials, the tax arrangements PwC promotes, based on artificially diverting profits to Luxembourg through intra-company loans, bear all the characteristics of a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme.’ The MPs said evidence which PwC executive provided to them two years ago, that they did not market or produce tax products, was ‘misleading’. 

Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, told the committee in 2013: ‘We are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have. I don’t see anything wrong with that.’

PwC and other accounting firms tried to claim that they made arrangements tailored to the needs of individual clients.

But PwC’s activities were revisited by the committee after the leak, three months ago, of 28,000 pages of documents by a former junior accountant at the firm. It exposed hundreds of deals PwC brokered – all ‘effectively variations on a scheme’, MPs said.

The whistleblower, Frenchman Antoine Deltour, 28, has been charged with theft and exposing trade secrets over the so-called ‘LuxLeaks’ scandal, which unveiled deals with some of the world’s largest firms, such as Apple, Ikea and Pepsi, to avoid billions in taxes.

Mrs Hodge said HM Revenue and Customs was also at fault, warning that without urgent action public finances will be harmed. The committee wants a code of conduct for all tax advisers to be enforced.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Since 2010 we have brought in £31billion additional tax from intervening with large businesses and tackling non-compliance ... We have an outstanding record for challenging multinationals and their tax advisers who try to get around UK tax law.’

This week it emerged that leather goods firm Smythson, which employs David Cameron’s wife Samantha, is based in Luxembourg for tax reasons.
