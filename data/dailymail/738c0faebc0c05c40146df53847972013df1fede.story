Almost 60 per cent of parents do not have any internet security in place on their children's computers, despite a report released yesterday that claims young children have never been more at risk online.

Ofcom has revealed that just 43 per cent of parents with children between the ages of five and 15 have filters in place on their family computer.

A total of 13 per cent of parents polled said they do not know how to install controls to stop their children stumbling across unsuitable material online, or even that such filters exist.

Around half of the parents with children aged below 15 admitted to Ofcom that they think their children are more web savvy than they are. A total of 14 per cent of parents believe their three to four-year-old has a better knowledge of how to use the internet than they do

Around half of the parents with children aged below 15 also admitted to the regulator that they think their children are more web savvy than they are.

Furthermore, 14 per cent of parents believe their three to four-year-old has a better grasp of how to use the internet than they do.

But still Ofcom's report, CHILDREN AND PARENTS: MEDIA USE AND ATTITUDES, which surveyed 2,374 parents, found 64 per cent believed their online safety measures were effective.

The report also found that only a small minority of parents have installed online filters on their children's internet-enabled smartphone and games consoles.

Almost ten per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds admitted they know someone who has accessed sexual content on their smartphones.

The report also found the use of tablets has tripled among five to 15-year-olds, up from 14 per cent to 42 per cent since 2012.

More than a quarter of three and four-year-olds now use a tablet computer at home.

Tablet usage is also rising rapidly among five to seven-year-olds, up from 11 per cent last year to 39 per cent, and eight to 11-year-olds, up from 13 per cent last year to 44 per cent.

The age groups are five times more likely than last year to use mostly a tablet when accessing the internet at home.

The proportion of children mainly using a laptop, netbook or desktop computer to use the internet has fallen from 85 per cent last year to 68 per cent.

The statistics support the Daily 
Mail’s campaign for internet service providers to be forced to block 
unsafe material, with over-18s able to access adult material only 
following a strict age check.

The
 Government has agreed a compromise solution, under which all new 
broadband contracts will have filters turned on and existing customers 
will be prompted to make a decision about their service.

Miranda
 Suit, co-chairman of Safermedia, said: ‘Ofcom’s figures show 
the problem of dealing with the internet is still growing.

‘Parents have still not been able to catch up with their children’s technology skills and protect them adequately.

‘Children
 who use tablets are more easily able to use public wi-fi. Instead of 
sitting at the family PC they can just go to the local park or café. And
 lots of public wi-fi is unfiltered, meaning they can access whatever 
they want.’

The report also found that only a small minority of parents have installed online filters on their children's internet-enabled smartphone and games consoles

She said she
 recognised the problems faced by parents. ‘The way children access the 
internet is getting more complex, and more difficult to monitor,’ said 
Miss Suit.

Siobhan Freegard, founder of the Netmums website, told The Daily Telegraph: 'You wouldn't leave your house front door 
open to strangers, but not setting parental controls means the door is 
wide open for strangers to contact your kids online.

'It's staggering to think over half of 
families don't have safety software in place, it means the message isn't
 getting out there about how to counteract the dangers.'

One of the key findings of the report, was that 30 per cent of 12 to 15-year-olds are 'friends' on a social network with a person they have never met in real life and have sent pictures and videos to them.

On
 average, teenagers said they had 272 online friends, but had never met 
78 of them. A third allowed their pages to be viewed by strangers, up 
from 22 per cent last year.

The
 Ofcom report warned: ‘Children with a social networking site profile 
that may be visible to people not known to them are more likely to have 
undertaken some kind of potentially risky online behaviour, such as 
adding people to their contacts they don’t know in person, or sending 
them photos or personal details.’
