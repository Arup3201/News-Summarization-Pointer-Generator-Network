Joseph Harwood as Miley Cyrus: The model transforms himself into well-known celebrities on YouTube

Joseph said: 'I was always an artistic child, drawing costumes and faces, but then I thought 'Why don't I just do this on myself?

'I create looks to tie in with current trends, like Miley, or classic looks like Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.

'I've also been in the industry - whether it's in front of or behind the camera.

'My YouTube channel is a great way to communicate with people and offer them help and tips, as well as showing off what make up can do.'

Joseph started modelling seven years ago aged just 15, but soon turned his hand to make up.After becoming obsessed with 90s supermodels, he took a college course and learned to make his own cosmetic products.

Now, he designs and makes everything himself.

Joseph said: 'My hair extensions, make up, clothing - I do it all myself.

'I
 loved 90s supermodels, and then I discovered glam rock. That opened so 
many doors for me and I realised what I could do with my make up and 
clothes.

'I don't just barge straight into the looks I create, I research everything.

'Especially
 with the classic looks I really want to get them right. There's so many
 people that would go mad if I got Marilyn Monroe wrong.'

As
 well as the celebrity creations, Joseph has also experimented with more
 themed looks, including drag queens, mermaids and supermodels.

He said: 'I love the mermaid vibe. I got really into this and it got a lot of attention.

'I try to balance doing people and looks that I know will attract people to my channel, and doing the ones I enjoy.

'I timed the Miley look to go with her new video and I got 60,000 views on it.'
