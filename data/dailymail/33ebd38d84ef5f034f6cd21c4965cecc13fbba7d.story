As far as the men of RAF 617 squadron were aware, the piece of paper pinned to the noticeboard in May 1943 was simply a list of those required for a night training run.

But the 133 names on 'Night Flying Programme. 16.5.43.' were destined to play a crucial role in the war, as they had actually been assigned to fly in the Dambusters raid.

The battle order document - which lists the names of all the crew in 19 Lancaster bombers who were to take part in the pivotal operation to flood the industrial heartland of Germany - is one of only two known to exist, and is set for auction tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the legendary attack.

It belonged to Air Commodore John Whitworth who, after the successful mission, put a poignant pencilled line through eight of the bombers that were lost.

Although they would not know until the last minute, the 133 names of RAF crewmen on 'Night Flying Programme. 16.5.43.' had been assigned to fly in the Dambusters raid. Of the 19 bombers, eight were downed, indicated by a pencil line just through the captain's name, as was common practice. The three waves of attack were marked as Red I, Grey II and White III. The numbers to the right of each row show the time the planes returned to base

It was common practice to only pencil out the name of the captain to signify a downed bomber - each containing a crew of seven.

For security reasons, only a handful of senior officers knew the details and objective of the mission until the last moment.

So secret were the plans that the battle order pinned up on the RAF noticeboard that day was entitled 'Night Flying Programme' to make it appear to the men it was a normal training run.

It was only four hours before the 19 planes took off for Germany's Ruhr valley that the crews were informed of their mission, codenamed Operation Chastise.

The first name on the sheet of paper was legendary Wing Commander Guy Gibson, who led the squadron and was told about the raid three days before.

Using the bouncing bomb invented by engineer Dr Barnes Wallis, seven Lancasters struck the Mohne and Eder dams, causing catastrophic flooding and wiping out scores of armament factories.

On his copy of the flying programme, Air Cdre Whitworth noted the times eight of the 11 bombers returned to RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, with Gibson's plane being the penultimate one at 4.15am.

Only one other copy of the battle order document is known to exist today and that is held at the RAF museum in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and does not include any personal annotations on it.

Although the mission was hailed a success, 53 crew members were lost and three were taken prisoner of war.

The document is being sold tomorrow on the 70th anniversary of the Dambusters' raid after being put up for auction by the son of a late RAF flyer.

Wing Commander John Bell, 90, flew with 617 Squadron after Operation Chastise.

He said: 'There weren't many copies of these night flying programmes printed.

'One would have been on the officers' ops board and another on the NCOs' board.

'The
men had been practising low-level night flying for several weeks before
the dams raid but had no idea what or when the mission was.

'The programme document would have been pinned up during the day but Bomber Command only gave the clearance for Operation Chastise at 4.45pm.

'The first Lancaster took off at 9.30pm. In between the two times, the men would have had briefings. The routes were already planned and the navigators had to plot them on their maps.

'Guy Gibson led the way. He bombed the Mohne dam first and then directed other aircraft circling to go in and drop their bombs. He then ordered the aircraft to go to the Eder dam and attack that.

'The times back and the losses would have been officially recorded but clearly this was Whitworth's own personal record.'

The 13in by 8in sheet of paper was later mounted in the the frame.

At some point, it was donated to a museum, possible at RAF Marham, Cambridgeshire, as wording on the frame states the item had been kindly loaned by the executors of the late Air Cdre Whitworth.

Chris Albury, of Dominic Winter auctioneers of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, said: 'It is being sold by the son whose father served in the RAF. Sadly, he doesn't know where or how his father acquired it.

'There is one copy of this document at the Grantham museum and this one was clearly made at the same time as it is in the same print and had identical folds, which would suggest the two documents were folded together.'

The document has a pre-sale estimate of £1,500.

The RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, a Lancaster bomber, will perform a fly-past of a Derbyshire reservoir at around 12.50pm on Thursday.

The plane, Britain's last operational Lancaster, will be joined by two Spitfires and two 
Tornados from today’s 617 Squadron for three spectacular runs down the Derwent Valley and strafe the 
Derwent Dam - just as Gibson and his men did so many times in those 
‘bloody dangerous’ training runs.

Earlier on, the devoted locals who run the little dam 
museum will also be holding their annual memorial service.

More than 400 veterans are also expected to gather at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, where the Dambusters squadron was based.

Among them will be members of Gibson’s family along with two veterans of the raid, and the daughter of bouncing bomb inventor Barnes Wallis.

On Friday, there will be an international service at Lincoln Cathedral.

But thanks to the health-and-safety brigade, few members of the public will be able to be there, too.

Severn Trent Water, which owns the dam, and other public sector ‘stakeholders’ have decreed heavy traffic on country lanes would pose an unacceptable threat to the emergency services.
