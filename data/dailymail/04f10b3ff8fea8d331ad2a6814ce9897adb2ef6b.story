Coalition relations are at breaking point as a furious row saw Nick Clegg branded a ‘w*****’ by Conservative colleagues.

The row followed Home Secretary Theresa May’s bitter attack on the Lib Dem leader’s refusal to give police and intelligence services powers to monitor internet, email and phone use of terror suspects.

Mrs May, increasingly tipped as a future Tory leader, accused the Lib Dems of being ‘outrageously irresponsible’ in blocking legislation to address a ‘crisis in national security’, claiming they had put children’s lives at risk.

The row between Theresa May and Nick Clegg came after the Lib Dem leader's refusal to give police services to monitor phone calls of terror suspects 

Yesterday, Mr Clegg demanded an apology over what he called ‘a new low point in Coalition relations’, accusing Mrs May of ‘false and outrageous slurs’. He said: ‘I have made it very, very clear to her that I expect an apology from her.’

But the Prime Minister backed Mrs May last night and Mr Clegg’s complaint was ridiculed by senior Tories. One told the Daily Mail that Mr Clegg was a ‘w*****’, and claimed his request to see the Home Secretary’s conference speech in advance this week had been rejected.

Another source close to Mrs May repeated the accusation that the Lib Dems were putting children at risk.

‘It’s interesting to see how the Lib Dems react to the logic of their position being aired in public but the truth is that they are putting lives at risk right now,’ the source said. ‘If they want to do something about that, they can start talking to us about returning to the Comms Data Bill that Nick Clegg first torpedoed on his radio show two years ago.’

Last night Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames called for an official investigation into the use of derogatory language to describe Mr Clegg.

He said the aide had breached the special adviser code of conduct.

David Cameron backed the Home Secretary, saying: ‘I thought Theresa May made a very strong speech about how important it is that we protect people from the dangers of terrorism on our streets and she set out a series of measures we have taken. 

'She set out some measures that a Conservative-only government would take to make us even more safe.’

Mr Clegg has now demanded an apology over what he called ‘a new low point in Coalition relations’

Government sources suggested the Coalition had entered a ‘new phase’ with just over 200 days to go before the General Election. ‘The two parties are going to make it clearer than ever where they disagree,’ said one Tory minister.

Yesterday’s row focused on plans for a Communications Data Bill, which would have meant telecommunications firms storing details of the time, duration, location and recipients of messages sent on social media, emails and mobile phones for up to 12 months. Mrs May said it was vital to allow the authorities to gain more insight into terrorist plots and other crimes. But last year, Mr Clegg announced he was blocking the plans.

The Home Office claims that as a result, over the past six months the National Crime Agency dropped 20 cases because of missing communications data, 13 of which involved a threat to the lives of children.

Mr Clegg, speaking on LBC Radio, said: ‘To say I’ve put children at risk is a level of misinformation I’ve not witnessed in four and a half years of this government.’

Mrs May, increasingly tipped as a future Tory leader, accused the Lib Dems of being ‘outrageously irresponsible’ in blocking legislation

‘The reason the National Crime Agency had to drop some of these cases was because IP addresses were not properly matched to individual mobile devices.

‘I have been saying for months that that is a problem we should deal with, and guess who has been dragging their feet to do something about it – the Home Office. 

'I think I am entitled to be a little bit aggrieved to hear a Conservative Home Secretary somehow claiming that my party is putting children at risk when it is their inactivity that is doing just that.’

Meanwhile Tory MPs are pressing Mr Cameron to move more quickly on his pledge to raise the 40p tax threshold to £50,000.

The Prime Minister has pledged to raise the starting threshold from its current level of £41,865 by 2020. But MP Kwasi Kwarteng suggested the tax cut could be implemented in three years. He said: ‘We have always got to take care of the deficit and for that reason it can’t be done in one go immediately. 

'But we need to do it as quickly as possible, and there is no reason why we couldn’t do it in three years.’
