A man has been charged with the manslaughter of a worker 11 years after his body was found trapped under the drum of a cement mixer. 

The body of Lee Balkwell was found crushed in the machinery in July 2002 at Baldwin's Farm in South Ockendon, Essex. 

Simon Bromley, who was his boss at the time, has been charged with unlawfully killing the 33-year-old and breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.

The incident is thought to have taken place while the deceased was drilling cement out of the mixer at around 1am on July 18, 2002.

Bromley, 44, is charged with failing to ensure the worker's safety while he operated the Hymix vehicle between July 16 and 19, and with his manslaughter.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'The offences are alleged to have occurred while Mr Balkwell was working at Baldwin's Farm.

The special casework lawyer added: 'I am satisfied there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for this case to be brought to court.'

The serious crime directorate re-investigated the case after the Independent Police Complaints Commission was critical of Essex Police’s original investigation and subsequent reviews.

Mr Balkwell's father, Lee Balkwell, lodged 92 complaints against the commission in three years following his son's death.

A 2008 inquest found the man had been unlawfully killed.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
