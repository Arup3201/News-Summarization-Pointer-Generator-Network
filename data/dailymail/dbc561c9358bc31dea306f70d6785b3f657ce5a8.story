Police have questioned a British expat over his movements on the night Madeleine McCann vanished seven years ago, it has been reported.

The self-employed gardener still lives in the Algarve region of Portugal and had worked near the resort where Madeleine's parents were staying in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. 

He said he was re-interviewed by British and Portuguese officers in Faro, Portugal, on Wednesday after originally giving a statement and a mouth swab in 2007.

Development: Police have reportedly interviewed an expat gardener over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (above). It comes 16 months after Scotland Yard opened a fresh investigation over the 2007 mystery

Claim: According to the report, the man visited a bar in the Ocean Club resort on the same night (pictured)

Speaking to the Sunday People, he strongly denied any involvement in the three-year-old's disappearance.

The questioning is said to have focused around his movements between the crucial hours of 7pm and 9.30pm on the night Madeleine vanished.

Her parents had left her sleeping while they had dinner a short distance away and raised the alarm at 10pm when they realised she was missing.

According to the People, he told the original Portuguese probe he had been at a bar in the McCanns' resort and left at 7pm to have a shower, before returning at 9.30pm and staying for two hours.

Last week it was reported that a British man and woman are among seven people due to be questioned over the girl's disappearance. 

Scotland Yard declined to comment on the latest claim.

The development comes 16 months after Scotland Yard opened a fresh investigation into the three-year-old's disappearance from her parents' holiday apartment in the Ocean Club resort.

Despite dozens of leads and suspects, which saw both British and Portuguese police reopen their investigations last year, detectives have still not found Madeleine's captor.

In July Scotland Yard officers searched land around the tourist resort using ground-penetrating radar and sniffer dogs to search for signs of disturbed earth. 

At one stage they pinpointed an overgrown hole in the ground, which had been covered with wood, an iron sheet and mounds of earth, and hacked away at it with chainsaws and spades.

Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry, both 46, were kept informed throughout the excavation work and were said to be bracing themselves for ‘significant news’.

Last year Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he wanted to 'try and end the torture that they are going through'.

He told the LBC radio station: 'We’ve got some definite lines of inquiry, we hope we can make some good progress, and we’ve got our best chance by working together with the Portuguese.' 

The McCanns' spokesman was unavailable for comment today.
