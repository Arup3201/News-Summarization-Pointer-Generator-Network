Up to half of California's big trees have disappeared in the past 90 years, according to a new study, which claims that decreases in water brought about by climate change may be to blame.

Scientists from the University of California and others compared forest surveys from the 1920s and 30s with recent U.S Forest Service data and found that there had been a huge decrease in the density of large trees in the state.

California is famous for its giant redwoods, pine and oak trees but smaller trees are becoming increasingly common in the state.

'Older, larger trees are declining because of disease, drought, logging and other factors, but what stands out is that this decline is statewide,' said study leader Patrick McIntyre. 

'Forests are becoming dominated by smaller, more densely packed trees, and oaks are becoming more dominant as pines decline.'

The authors, which include scientists from UC Davis and the U.S. Geological Survey, found that the density of large trees declined in all regions of California, with declines of up to 50 per cent in the Sierra Nevada highlands, the south and central coast ranges and northern California.

They believe that water deficit, which is linked to climate change, may be a factor in the demise of the state's imposing trees.

'Based on our data, water stress helps to explain the decline of large trees,' McIntyre said. 'Areas experiencing declines in large-tree density also experienced increased water stress since the 1930s.'

Co-author David Ackerly, a professor of integrative biology, said that stressed forests and the loss of large trees could exacerbate the global carbon situation, especially since many are hoping that forests will soak up more and more fossil fuel emissions.

'There's no question that if you are losing large trees, you are losing the standing carbon in the forest,' he said. 'Loss of these big trees and the impact of drought stress become a big concern going forward in terms of its impact on the carbon cycle; they can turn a carbon sink into a source of carbon released to the atmosphere.'

The results, the authors say, may help forecast future forest responses to climate change, and in particular suggest that increased temperatures and changing water availability may lead to large-scale changes in forest composition throughout western North America.

Redwood trees, which are native to California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, are the world's largest by volume reaching heights of 274.9 feet (84.2 metres) and a ground level girth of 109 feet (33 metres). 

The oldest known Giant Sequoia based on its ring count is 3,500 years old. 

The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

At an exhibtion in San Diego, a trunk slice of a huge Sequoia tree was exhibited, measuring 4 meters in diameter. It stems from a tree  1,510 years old
