Three fraudsters who deliberately caused a crash in which a woman died were jailed for a total of more than 30 years yesterday.

The trio had planned to make bogus claims for personal injury and damage to their vehicle in the attempted £20,000 scam.

But motorist Baljinder Gill, 34, was left stranded in the fast lane of a dual carriageway on the A40 near Denham, Buckinghamshire, after she was caught up in the planned collision.

She received fatal injuries and became the first person to have been killed in Britain in a deliberate ‘cash for crash’ collision.

A jury at Reading Crown Court found 
Radoslaw Bielawski, Andrzez Skowron and Jacek Kowalczyk guilty of 
causing Miss Gill’s death by dangerous driving and conspiracy to commit 
fraud.

Miss Gill was not the intended victim 
of the fraud. The business van in front of her had been targeted because
the gang knew it would have valid insurance.

The experienced driver of the van 
managed to stop safely despite the gang’s attempt. However, Miss Gill’s 
Ford Fiesta rammed into the back  of the van. She left her car with its 
hazard lights flashing but when she went back to retrieve possessions 
it was hit by another van and she was left fatally injured.

During the trial the jury heard how an
Audi A3 driven by Skowron swerved in front of a Volkswagen Passat 
containing ‘co-conspirators’.

The Passat, driven by Kowalczyk, braked sharply, causing the shunt.

Bielawski later admitted to police that the collision had been staged.

High Court Judge Mr Justice Sweeney 
said the death of Miss Gill had an ‘absolutely devastating’ effect on 
her family who shortly afterwards lost one of her brothers to cancer.

Relatives of Miss Gill, who lived in 
Stanwell, near Staines in Surrey – little more than a dozen miles from 
the crash site – were in court to see the men, all from London, jailed.

The family said Miss Gill was ‘the innocent victim of a cold-blooded and calculated incident’.

‘Our family will never recover from 
this tragic event which took the life of our beautiful daughter, sister 
and truly loved member of our family from us,’ they said.

Kowalczyk, 32, Bielawski, 24, and 
Skowron, 26, were each jailed for ten years for causing death by 
dangerous driving in the pile-up.

Each was banned from driving for five 
years and will have to retake a test before they drive again. Kowalczyk 
and Bielawski were also ordered to serve a further three months in jail 
for perverting the course of justice.

Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, said 
figures from the Insurance Fraud Bureau revealed that cash for crash 
fraud costs the industry £1.7million a day. Mr Justice Sweeney told the 
three men that this type of fraud was affecting everyday policy holders 
through increased premiums to pay for an annual £392million.

He said the sentence was given to 
deter others planning the fraud. Van driver Colin Lee, 34, who was not 
part of the fraud, was jailed for 12 months after being convicted of 
causing death by careless driving.

Mr Justice Sweeney said that he had 
been inadvertently caught up in the fraud but he should have been able 
to prevent a collision with Miss Gill’s stricken car.

Arthur Okrutny, 23, was not involved 
in the incident but was at a party at home in Norbury, London, when he 
said he received phone calls from Bielawski, a childhood friend, 
offering him £300 to tell police it was him who had been in the car.

He was jailed for 12 months after a 
jury found him guilty of perverting the course of justice but was 
cleared of any involvement in the fraud.
