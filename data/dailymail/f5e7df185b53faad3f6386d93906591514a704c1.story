The captain of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is nothing more than a geek who took his work home with him, investigators have today revealed.

Police officers probing the disappearance of flight MH370 said they do not believe the captain had practised sabotaging his own aircraft on his own flight simulator.

Speculation had been rife that Captain Zahaire Ahmad Shah had spent time on his flight simulator at home in Kuala Lumpur, working out how to make the Boeing 777 'invisible' after it took off bound for Beijing on March 8.

Investigators probing the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are understood to have found nothing suspicious on the flight simulator and computer seized at Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's (pictured) Kuala Lumpur home

CNN today reported police sources had revealed after reassembling the simulator at police headquarters, experts believe it showed nothing suspicious.

The same applied to the captain's computer, it was claimed.

With nothing lurking on either device that raised alarm bells, the discovery appears to corroborate the protests by 53-year-old Zaharie's family and friends that he was noting more than a 'tech geek' who loved flying so much, that he took his work home with him.

The claims only serve to deepen the mystery of what happened to the aircraft as the search enters its twelfth day, spanning an area the size of Australia.

If, as sources claim, the flight simulator and the captain's computer are free of any suspicious material, it diverts suspicion from him, but does nothing to solve the mystery of what else could have caused the plane to suddenly turn in a westwards direction, towards the Strait of Malacca.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today said someone with a high degree of flying skills had deliberately disabled the communication system.

As suspicion shifts away from Captain Zaharie (right), police officers are said to be refocusing on co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid (left) whose last words before communication with the aircraft was lost were 'all right, good night'

But with the evidence appearing to 
point the finger away from the captain, suspicion is set to fall back on
 to co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid.

The
 27-year-old's last words before all communication with the aircraft 
ceased, were 'All right, good night' - which is not a normal sign off.

Some
 experts have suggested that late at night, flying over a ‘quiet 
region’, like the South China Sea, pilots do sometimes chatter idly over
 their radios.

he revelation comes as a satellite image appeared to show the missing plane in the skies above an expanse of jungle.

The image is taken from Tomnod, the map search website currently being used by hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to search for missing passenger plane, was posted on Reddit on Sunday.

The authenticity of the photo has not yet been verified and the region depicted in the photo is as yet unknown. Intriguingly, the plane appears to have been painted white.

Spotted: Thai military say they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path, heading left over Malaysia and towards the Strait of Malacca

The image was found by an university student in Taiwan, according to Taiwan's China Times.

The
 image has surfaced at the same time as the news that Malaysian 
villagers claim to have seen the missing Malaysian Airlines jet flying 
over the north east of the country at around the time the aircraft is 
thought to have made a 'U-turn'.

At least nine people - tuna 
fishermen, farmers and villagers - in the Malaysian state of Kelantan 
have made reports to police about seeing lights in the sky and some said
 they heard the loud noise of an engine.

These
 accounts appear to match the conclusions of investigators who say the 
jet flew low to avoid radar after making a sharp turn and heading west 
from its course over the South China Sea.

Investigators
 told the New Straits Times that they were now convinced the aircraft 
flow low over the village, which is in the north east - exactly the same
 area where the villagers and fishermen who saw bright lights in the sky
 and heard noises on the night the jet vanished are living.

The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board

'Terrain masking', as illustrated here, is a technique used by pilots to avoid radar detection

Investigators told a Malaysian 
newspaper that the Boeing 777 had dropped to a lower altitude - under 
5,000ft - to avoid ground radar, using the surrounding terrain as a 
sonar barrier.

Mr Alif 
Fathi Abdul Hadi, 29 who said he saw the light heading towards the South
 China Sea at 1.45am on the night the aircraft disappeared.

Lending
 credibility to the account by Mr Alif is the claim by fisherman Azid 
Ibrahim, 55, who saw a bright light streaking overhead at 1.30am on 
Saturday, about 100 miles south of where Mr Alif had seen the light.

Mr Alif told said the bright light 
was the type that aircraft use when taking off and landing at night - 
like a car uses its headlights.

'I was walking towards the rear of my house when I saw the light, and wondered where it was heading to,' he said.

'The airspace here is like a highway for aircraft and they usually travel in routine patterns.

'However,
 the light I saw was moving towards a completely different direction. It
 was going towards the sea, near Bachok (which lies to the south of Mr 
Alif's home).'

Another theory today examined the possibility that a fire on board, caused by a bomb hidden in the cargo hold among four tonnes of mangosteens - an exotic fruit about the size of an orange - could have downed the flight.

An explosion could cause the cabin to lose all compressions and render the pilots unconscious before they were able to apply their oxygen masks.

The theory is supported by one witness, who claims to have spotted an aircraft on fire over the South China Sea.

New Zealander Mike McKay, working on an oil rig off the southern coast of Vietnam, claims to have seen what he believed was an aircraft on fire at about the time all communication with MH370 was lost.
