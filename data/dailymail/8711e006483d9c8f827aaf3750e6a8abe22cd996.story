Port Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, should be renamed Port Margaret as a tribute to Baroness Thatcher, senior figures in the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence are suggesting.

The idea is being backed by MPs and is also attracting considerable support on the islands, which Lady Thatcher was responsible for liberating in 1982.

The proposal is likely to trigger fury in Argentina, which has been ratcheting up the rhetoric over the sovereignty of the Falklands around the 30th anniversary of the conflict.

Port Stanley is named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby, who was British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never set foot in the Falklands.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, a Parliamentary aide at the Foreign Office, said: ‘I would warmly encourage the Falklanders to consider this as a fitting way to remember her legacy.

‘She has been an inspirational 20th century political hero. One way to mark this extraordinary life and contribution would be for the Port to be renamed from one prime minister who never set foot there to another who liberated it.’

Mr Ellwood, who headed a successful campaign to have the tower which houses Big Ben renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee last year, added: ‘Port Margaret has a fine ring to it.’

Devizes MP Claire Perry, who is Parliamentary private secretary to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, said: ‘I think it is a fantastic idea, as long as the people of the Falklands agree.’

Andrew Rosindell, secretary of the all-party Parliamentary group on the Falklands, said the islanders would want to mark Lady Thatcher’s passing.

‘It is up to them exactly how they do it,’ he said.

‘It could be a renaming or it could be a statue in Stanley. Whatever they do I am sure they will commemorate her in an appropriate way.’ #

Zoran Zuvic, a Falkland Islands Defence Force member who met Lady Thatcher four times, said: ‘Anything that remembers Maggie and what she did for us is a good idea, and I imagine many other Falklanders would support it too.

'She’s our hero, a great person, and she will forever be part of the history of our islands.

‘We recently renamed an island here after Craig Jones, a Para who was the last soldier to die in the war. If we’ve named an island after one soldier, there’s every chance we can rename our capital after the person we owe everything to.’

Former Falklands policeman Graham Didlick, now a battlefield tour guide, said: ‘I would be open to the idea of changing Stanley’s name in honour of Margaret Thatcher. She was a great woman. It is highly likely that if she wasn’t in power when Argentina invaded the Falklands I wouldn’t be here today.’

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said: ‘It is clearly a matter for the islanders but it would be a very nice tribute, and wholly appropriate.

‘It would also annoy [Argentina’s] President Kirchner, which on its own is a good reason for doing it.’

There have been calls for a statue to be erected to Lady Thatcher in Parliament Square, where Sir Winston Churchill is commemorated.

Mr Rosindell said: ‘There is an empty space in one corner of Parliament Square and it would be entirely appropriate for a statue to be erected to Lady Thatcher.’

Another suggestion was for Lady Thatcher to occupy the vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square.

John Muxworthy, Lieutenant Commander on the Canberra during the Falklands conflict, said: ‘Let’s have a full-scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation.’

Lord Tebbit said: ‘I think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured in the centre of London. She could be in Trafalgar Square, where Nelson could keep an eye on her.’

Lady Thatcher is one of only four former prime ministers to be recognised with a statue in the members’ lobby of the House of Commons.

The statue, which joined Churchill, Attlee and Lloyd George, was approved only after a change in the rules which previously barred depictions of living figures in the small lobby.

Yesterday a single daffodil had been placed at the foot of the statue with a small card bearing the hand-written message: ‘You were an inspiration to women.’

Caricature: A star of television satire Spitting Image says he was inspired by Mrs Thatcher as Prime Minister

Spitting Image impressionist Steve Nallon yesterday paid tribute to Lady Thatcher, saying the hit show would never have existed without her.

Nallon, 52, impersonated the handbag-wielding Prime Minister on the satirical ITV show from 1984 to 1990.

He found fame with his cross-dressing caricature of Mrs Thatcher, and portrayed her as a tyrant who used urinals and loathed the French.

But he said his upbringing in a working-class Tory family meant his grandmother never watched the programme.

Nallon said: ‘My grandmother got very cross. I came from a working-class Tory background and my grandmother refused to watch Spitting Image and only watched That’s Life. But I understood strong independent women because I had been brought up by them, and I tried to do her as real as possible.

‘If it was not for Margaret Thatcher, Spitting Image would not have existed.’

Nallon added: ‘The conviction of the woman – I had genuinely forgotten, because I have not done her for a long time, how she had the attitude coming straight through. She didn’t hide.

‘She was not known for having a sense of humour. Even her friends admitted that side to her character. I don’t think she would have got it.

‘She never understood anyone who didn’t agree with her, and that included comedians.’
