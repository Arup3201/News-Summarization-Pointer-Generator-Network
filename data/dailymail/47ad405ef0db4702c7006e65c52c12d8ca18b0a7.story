As firefighters across the western United States responded to blazes, efforts in Washington were made especially difficult as winds pushed fast-moving flames east of a small town, destroying dozens of houses.

Eight residents were spotted cutting a swathe of fire breaks into the ground using hand tools, but gusty winds and high temperatures have fanned the flames dangerously close to the small town of Cle Elum in central Washington, which is about 75 miles east of Seattle.

And in California, up to 1,800 acres of the San Jacinto Mountains were burnt to a crisp  leading to mandatory evacuations in the area as up to 500 firefighters using air tankers and helicopters battled to control the blaze.

Other efforts to deal with the fire 
burning on grassland, timber and sagebrush have been hampered by the 
weather conditions and the blaze has so far burned at least 28,000 acres or 44 square miles on the east slope of the Cascades mountain range.

No injuries have been reported, but at least 900 people have been forced to leave their homes because of the blaze.Several hundred outbuildings have also been destroyed.

It is believed the fire started on Monday at a bridge construction site located on Highway 10, between Ellensburg and Cle Elum.

Incident commander Rex Reed said that by last night the blaze around Taylor Bridge was ten per cent contained, thanks to a containment line built around the southeast corner of the fire.

But the blaze continues to spread and more than 400 firefighters from across the state were now trying to keep the flames away from heavy timber to the north.

If the flames reach that abundant source of dry fuel, 'that adds a whole new equation,' said Reed.

Joe Seemiller, a captain in Kittitas 
County Fire and Rescue, said he and his crews monitored the edge of the fire 
near the Yakima River yesterday.

They have been trying to keep it from crossing to the other side and placing more homes under threat.

'Unless Mother Nature helps us out here, we're going to be fighting this awhile,' said Seemiller.

Governor Chris Gregoire has declared a state of emergency for Kittitas and Yakima counties in response to the blaze.

Air support from the Washington National Guard has also been called in and the State Transportation Department said a 14-mile section of US Highway 97 was closed because of the fire.

Meanwhile, people have been making efforts to stop the flames coming towards their properties.

Chane Roghair, 39, has been trying to dampen hot spots around his 1,300-acre ranch of beef cattle and quarter horses.

Mr Roghair placed tanker trucks around his two hay barns to keep them from catching fire when the blaze passed through on Monday, and he said he spent the night keeping watch and dousing spot fires.

No buildings or livestock were lost — his 30 goats hustled down the hill toward the house when the ridge caught fire — but the fire destroyed the original homestead that had been empty for years.

Lands Commissioner Peter Goldmark briefly traveled into the burned area where the fire started. In the distance, black smoke rose from a burning home in a subdivision across the river.

He said the unusual amount of light fuels created by the cool, damp spring, coupled with high temperatures and windy conditions has created fires so destructive that they are impossible to hold or suppress.

Holidaymakers Brad Rorem and his two sons spotted the blaze while at their family cabin, one of many holiday homes scattered in forests around Cle Elum.

They were preparing to float the Yakima River when they noticed the fire under the bridge from their deck.

'It sort of erupted, and the wind was blowing hard in our faces,' he said. 'It just shot up so fast.'

The homes of at least three neighbors were gone, said Mr Rorem, 50, of North Bend.

Neighbors
John Thometz and Miriam Greenman watched from a side road as another 
neighbor's home went up in flames. They couldn't tell which home burned.

Mr Thometz had a close call with an arson fire in 2004, but this is the closest flames have come to his property.

'This one here is the tinder box,' he said. 'This is the bad one.'

Ms
Greenman left with her six-year-old son, Nathaniel, a handful of 
clothes and some of his favorite toys to comfort him. Their fish stayed 
behind.

She said: 'I feel bad about the fish, but I figured he was in water and he'd have to tough it out.'

The fire has also threatened a chimpanzee
sanctuary. 'They definitely know there's weirdness happening,' said 
Outreach Director Diana Goodrich.

Efforts
to bring the blaze under control may receive a small boost today, with 
weather reports suggesting the gusty winds on the east side of the 
mountains will finally die down.

In Idaho, authorities said a 
firefighter was killed by a falling tree Sunday. Anne Veseth, a 
20-year-old who was in her second season as a firefighter, died as she 
worked a fire near Orofino, the U.S. Forest Service said.

In
Utah, a lightning-sparked fire consumed about 34 square miles, 
threatened a herd of wild horses and shut down the historic Pony Express
Road in the state's western desert.

Along
the Nevada-Oregon state line, a vast wildfire grew to about 675 square 
miles. Over the weekend, the blaze prompted evacuations and forced one 
firefighter to crawl into an emergency fire shelter. She suffered minor 
burns and smoke inhalation, officials said.

Across
California, thousands of firefighters also were contending with dry 
conditions, strong winds and triple-digit temperatures. The blazes left 
some areas with smoke lingering in the air.

In
Northern California, hundreds of evacuees were allowed to return home 
as crews made progress against a wildfire that threatened 500 homes in 
the Spring Valley and Long Valley communities.

In Southern California, a cluster of four lightning-sparked wildfires in northeastern San Diego County stretched to nearly 4 square miles, state fire officials said.

Officials added the fires threatened electrical distribution lines that serve the communities of Borrego Springs, Warner Springs and Ranchita, some 50 miles northeast of downtown San Diego.

'Of course we’re concerned,' said John Miller, spokesman for the San Bernardino National Forest to the Morris Daily Herald.

'This year our big concern is the fact that rainfall — and that includes snow — for our forest was somewhere between 50 percent to 70 percent of normal.'

Evacuations were ordered for the sparsely populated area near Aguanga as well as Racnchita and San Felipe and up to 500 firefighters are involved in battling the blaze.

'We have very dry vegetation, brush and grass and things like that. Now we have multiple days of very high temperatures,' said Chief Julie Hutchinson, spokeswoman for the state fire agency.

'It’s like lighting your fireplace with a blowtorch.'

'That’s one thing that’s unique about California. We have a state fire agency, and we’re able to move resources up and down the state.'

Fires across California have also affected some national parks with road and camp closures, including Lassen Volcanic National Park and Joshua Tree National Park.
