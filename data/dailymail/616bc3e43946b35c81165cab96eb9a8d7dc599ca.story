Several members of the Tottenham squad took some well-deserved time off as they watched the semi-finals of the World Darts Championship on Saturday night.

Andros Townsend, whose girlfriend Hazel O'Sullivan is a walk-on girl, has been a regular at the darts but while the winger watched on the TV, team-mates Kyle Walker, Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose and Kyle Naughton were all in attendance at Alexandra Palace.

Vertonghen, Rose and Walker all started the incredible 5-3 win against Chelsea at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day and they celebrated the victory by attending the darts on semi-final night.

Townsend and Rose both scored in Thursday's unlikely win, while a Harry Kane brace and a Nacer Chadli strike earned Spurs three points against their London rivals as Mauricio Pochettino's side moved up to fifth in the Premier League.

But they were fully focused on the action on Saturday night as Gary Anderson beat Michael van Gerwen 6-3 to book his place in Sunday's final.

That match was followed by Phil Taylor's semi-final victory against Raymond van Barneveld as The Power goes in search of his 17th world championship win.

After their evening out the Tottenham players' attention will turn to Monday night when they travel to Turf Moor for their FA Cup third round clash with Burnley.
