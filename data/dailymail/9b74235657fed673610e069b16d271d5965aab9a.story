A young British volunteer has died in South East Asia – just days after revealing he had caught a life-threatening tropical disease.

Richard Cann, 24, had been working with the Orangutan Health Project on the western Indonesian island of Sumatra.

Ten days ago he wrote on Facebook that he had caught dengue fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes.

Richard Cann, 24, was working at the Orangutan Health Project on Sumatra, Indonesia, when he fell ill

He posted a message saying: ‘Had dengue fever last week. Slept solidly for four to five days, now feeling on the mend.’

He also revealed he had been ‘sitting in 45C heat with no doctors and no air con, hot water for the joints and a cat for cuddles’. 

He added: ‘Should be fine next week. I’m made of tougher stuff.’

However the university graduate, from Winchester, collapsed and died following a seizure on Monday. 

It is still unclear whether his death was linked to his fever.

His parents, Kate and Chris, have flown out to the island.

Dengue is a common viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It is common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, with Brazil having the highest number of cases.

Symptoms include:

- A high temperature that can reach up to 41ºC

- Headache

- Pain behind the eyes

- Bone, muscle and joint pain

An infected human is bitten by the mosquito, the infected mosquito then bites another human and the cycle continues.

The condition is widespread in areas with a high mosquito populations. Dengue usually clears up by itself within two to three weeks.

There are no specific medications to treat the disease but symptoms can be managed using paracetamol.

A number of people will go on to suffer a more serious form of the illness, known as 'severe dengue'. It is a potentially fatal complication which can lead to shock, bleeding and organ damage.
