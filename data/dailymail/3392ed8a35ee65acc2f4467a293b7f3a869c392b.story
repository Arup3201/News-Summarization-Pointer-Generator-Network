While Cara Delevingne maintains she does 'nothing' to prepare for her runway appearances and constantly tweets photos of herself munching on burgers and McDonalds, it seems that not all models are as genetically blessed as the 21-year-old.

And now, thanks to a new cookbook, we have been granted an insight into what the world's top clothes-horses really eat to stay in shape (and Cara's fast food favourites are nowhere in sight).

Karlie Kloss, Lily Donaldson, Lindsey Wixson and Milla Jovovich have all contributed recipes to a new cookbook, appropriately titled Model Kitchen.

Get the model look: Karlie Kloss, Lily Donaldson and Milla Jovovich have all contributed recipes to a new cookbook, appropriately titled Model Kitchen

The book has been written by 24-year-old Armani model Cesar Casier and
according to his blog 'aims to give a good example of what people 
should eat'.

Lily Donaldson's reveals her favourite recipe as kale salad, Karlie Kloss offers a fresh mango salsa, and Milla Jovovich opts for baked salmon and green asparagus.

Belgian Cesar started modelling four years ago and has walked the runway for the likes of Dolce and Gabanna and YSL.

Speaking about the inspiration behind
his book, he said: I always had a big love for food. My dad is a great 
chef, that's where I probably got my passion from.

Model of the moment Cara Delevingne, who is known for her healthy appetite and love of burgers, is not contributing

'I wrote Model Kitchen for fun. I also have a bucket list in my head and writing a book was on the list.

'With the book I want to prove that models DO eat, but when we eat, we eat healthy, fresh and low in calories.'

He added: 'When I started modeling I realised I needed to change my eating habits and that I needed to do much more exercise.

Tricks of the trade: Ceaser believes that a model's body is their instrument so a health diet is essential

'I try to go to do more sports (swim, running, gym) at least 4 times a week.

'As a model our body is our work instrument, so it's very important to take good care of that.

'Only one girl gave me a pasta dish, Suvi Koponen, so I guess that carbs are not a models favorite!'

The book has been published and nearly sold out in Dutch and an English version will be available online at www.net-a-porter.com next week.
