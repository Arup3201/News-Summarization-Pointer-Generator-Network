Jon Daly insists Rangers' players have to step up to the plate to keep Ally McCoist in his job.

The Rangers manager is under growing pressure after an indisciplined 2-0 loss to Hearts on Saturday left the Ibrox club nine points adrift in the SPFL Championship.

Crippled by the loss of midfielder Steven Smith to a needless red card after 21 minutes at Tynecastle, a 1,000-strong travelling support turned on their manager vocally even before Jamie Walker’s decisive strike from the penalty spot.

Handed a start in place of the misfiring Kris Boyd, Daly admitted the players let their manager down and now have to answer key questions.

‘Once we go out on the park we need to provide performances and wins,’ said the Irishman.

‘The last couple of weeks we’ve not done that. We need to start doing that for the manager to start helping him out.

‘All the boys really like the manager and the coaching staff. You have to look close to home as players and ask ourselves are we doing enough to help him out when we go out there?’

A defiant McCoist says he has given no thought to his own position and insists Rangers can still reel in Hearts to win automatic promotion.

Beaten in all three meetings with the Tynecastle side and Edinburgh rivals Hibernian, however, Saturday’s loss was a bitter blow which raised fresh questions over the managerial future of the club’s all time top scorer.

Unhappy with Smith for a reckless, dangerous sliding challenge on Callum Paterson, McCoist said the converted full-back had let his side down.

‘Obviously a decision, a red card, hasn’t helped him,’ added Daly. ‘That’s not me saying I think Smudger (Smith) has let us down, I don’t think he has, I think he’s unfortunate.

‘He’s gone to win the ball and he’s slightly late. In this day and age, you seem to get red cards for tackles like that.’

Referee Craig Thomson showed leniency towards Rangers in the second half when Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd were spared red cards for further late challenges.

Miller appeared to be unhappy with Paterson for his reaction to the Smith red card and a subsequent later challenge.

Suggesting Hearts — who could be missing Kevin McHattie for up to three months after he was injured following a Miller challenge — contributed to the nine yellow and one red card shown by referee Thomson, Daly added: ‘For me, I don’t think their reaction helps the situation, but that seems to be the way football is. It’s changed an awful lot since I started playing.

‘That seems to be coming in a lot more into the game, players trying to get people booked and sent off.

‘I don’t think it’s the right thing to be doing but that is obviously the way football seems to be changing.

‘I think it’s a man’s game and when a player gets hit and he goes down screaming like he’s been shot by a sniper I don’t think it really helps the case.

‘Obviously, the referee hears a scream and sees the reaction of a player rolling on the floor and he thinks he has been seriously hurt. You have to cut the referee a bit of slack because if he sees that he thinks it’s a serious injury.

‘But you have to ask questions of the players if they are trying to con the ref or not.’
