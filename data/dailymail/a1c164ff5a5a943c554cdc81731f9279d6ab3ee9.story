A Pittsburgh family is devastated after their two-year-old son drowned in a swimming pool just moments after his uncle suffered a seizure and relatives rushed to help.

Little Blake Metzger was at his grandmother's house on Monday afternoon while his parents were at work. When his uncle, who was in the backyard of the home, became ill, the child was left alone and climbed into the pool by himself.

His grandmother went to look for him minutes later and found the child unresponsive at the bottom of the above-ground pool.

She tried to resuscitate him but failed and the boy was rushed to Canonsburg General Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. It is presumed the uncle recovered from the seizure.

'Just that quick he climbed up the ladder while they were trying to help my brother out of the seizure,' his devastated dad, Erik Metzger, told Channel 11. 'They looked up and he was already in the pool and that's how fast it happened.'

Washington County coroner Tim Warco said the county received two 911 calls within five minutes from the residence - one for the uncle and one moments later for the boy.

Mr Metzger received the devastating news at work.

'If I have a message for anyone, it's that it only takes one second. Now the rest of my life I have to think about him not being here,' Mr Metzger said.

The boy's mother April Sharratt thanked paramedics who she said tried hard to save her son's life.

'They tried hard for about an hour, but (he) didn't have no pulse, so they can only do so much. They did their best,' she told WTAE.

Mr Metzger said that his son's organs will be donated in the hope that he can help another family avoid the pain he's feeling.

'My kid is gone. I can't bring him back. But if I can help some other mom not feel my pain, then that's what I'm going to do,' Metzger said.

Quick: The child slipped into the pool while his family was distracted helping his uncle

Organs: Blake's father said he would donate his son's organs to prevent other families feeling his pain

The Metzger family said they ripped the swimming pool out of the backyard as soon as they got home from the hospital because they didn't want to look at it.

'We are really struggling right now. I never thought I'd have to bury my two-year-old son,' Metzger told the station.

A teddy bear, large toy truck and a balloon were seen in the yard of the Richland Avenue home where the boy lived on Tuesday.

The family has set up a fund with PNC Brank branch to help pay for their son's funeral costs. Anyone can donate to the fund called the Blake Metzger Fund at any branch.
