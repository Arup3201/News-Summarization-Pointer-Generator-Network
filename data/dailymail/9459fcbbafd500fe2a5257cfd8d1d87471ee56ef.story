A man has been charged with posting an offensive tweet about two Newcastle United fans who died in the MH17 plane disaster.

Mitchell Tace Chapman, 18, of Sunderland, has been charged with making a malicious communication, which Northumbria Police said was in connection to ‘remarks posted on Twitter relating to two of the men who died’ on flight MH17.

It is understood the two men were Newcastle United football fans John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, who were flying to New Zealand to watch their team play pre-season friendlies.
