Blackburn Rovers manager Gary Bowyer has travelled to India for a crunch meeting with owners Venky's after they rejected Hull City's bid of £10million plus Alex Bruce for Jordan Rhodes.

Blackburn issued a statement on Saturday confirming that they had rejected two offers from Hull and that Rhodes was not for sale but Bowyer needs funds to strengthen his squad and may yet be forced to sacrifice the prolific striker.

Hull have £12m to spend following the sale of Shane Long and may be prepared to throw all of that at Blackburn to get Rhodes who scored in yesterday's 3-2 win over Bournemouth, his 54th in 100 appearances for the club. 

Transfer: Jordan Rhodes has been the subject of two separate bids from Premier League side Hull City

Manager Steve Bruce is desperate to bring in a striker. He has been rebuffed in attempts to bring in Danny Welbeck from Manchester United so far and believes Troy Deeney of Watford to be too expensive at £10m.

He is also closing on a deal for Tottenham defender Michael Dawson and will increase his offer for the 30-year-old this week to around £5m but his main objective is to sign a goalscorer and Bowyer's meeting in India could prove pivotal. 

FFP: Blackburn were worried they would have to sell Rhodes to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations

Blackburn's director of communications Alan Myers said: 'We have recently received two official bids for the services of Jordan Rhodes from Hull City FC, both have been respectfully and categorically rejected.

'The owners of Blackburn Rovers wish to reassure fans that their intention is not to sell Jordan Rhodes as they, along with the manager and board of directors, feel that he is integral to our bid to gain promotion back to the Premier League.

'Despite the necessity to comply with and address the pending restrictions of FFP regulations, the owners feel it would be a detrimental step to lose our top goalscorer and such an icon of this football club. 

Tally: The Scotland international has scored 53 goals in 99 appearances for Championship side Blackburn

'We made our intentions clear this summer when we rewarded Jordan with a new and improved contract and we stand by that.

'We want to give Gary Bowyer and the team the best possible opportunity to get back to the top flight and Jordan has been and remains a significant part of that aim.

'It is also important to acknowledge that Jordan has acted, unsurprisingly, in a totally professional manner during this period of speculation.'
