The ceremonial first pitch at a new baseball park is often a star-studded event aimed at opening a new arena in style.

And when the Miami Marlins managed to secure Muhammad Ali as the surprise guest at their newly-opened stadium, MLB bosses thought they were on to a crowd-pleasing winner.

But sadly when the 70-year-old boxing legend was wheeled out for the ceremony last night, the rousing reception quickly turned to hushed silence when the great man's ailing health became all too apparent.

Uncomfortable: The 70-year-old boxing legend appeared visibly frail as he appeared in front of shocked baseball fans

Ali, who has suffered from Parkinson's Disease since 1984, appeared visibly frail as he was presented in front of the Miami crowd during the 'uncomfortable' and 'unnecessary' appearance.

The boxing legend was transported on to the pitch very slowly in a cart, his arms shaking heavily as Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria clutched his hand and held his shoulder.

The Miami Marlins stadium announcer attempted to generate a crowd response during Ali's appearance, but bewildered baseball fans instead looked in with sadness and apparent discomfort at the great man's clearly deteriorating health.

The distressing scenes eventually came to
an end when shortstop Hanley Ramirez took the ball from Ali's shaking 
right hand and the game was allowed to begin.

Ali, who wore sunglasses during last night's appearance, does not speak in public anymore and rarely makes appearances.

U.S. sports website Deadspin described the ceremony as opening Marlins Park in 'the saddest, most awkward way possible'.

Deadspin writer Erik Malinowski wrote: 'Loria slung his arm around Ali's shoulders, while Ali's hands shook profusely the entire time.

'The crowd initially cheered, but stopped after 30 seconds.

'The opening of Marlins Park started off with a parade of showgirls and Jose Feliciano singing the National Anthem.

'It ended with the sad, shameless sight of Loria trotting out Ali's disease-ravaged body for a forced on-field ceremony.'

Other baseball experts described the brief appearance of Ali on the mound at Marlins Park as 'uncomfortable' and 'unnecessary'.

Those watching the ceremony on television took to Twitter to express their concern for Ali's health during the uncomfortable Miami appearance.

One user posted: 'I was excited to see Muhammad Ali's ceremonial first pitch at Marlins Park... but that was just tragic seeing him in his current condition.'

Another Twitter user, David Lennon, posted: 'Watching Ali on the cart during this Marlins Park ceremony was heartbreaking.'
