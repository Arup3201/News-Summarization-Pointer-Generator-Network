Guilty: Nurse Roger Dean, 37, admitted killing 11 elderly residents of the nursing home where he worked, and is serving a life sentence, but it has now been revealed that Dean had covered up the fact that he had been sacked for turning up at a previous job with slurred speech and frothing at the mouth from drug use

The nurse convicted of murdering 11 elderly people after starting a fire inside a nursing home had been suspending from his previous job because he was frothing at the mouth on drugs.

An inquest into the deaths of 14 people after a 2011 fire at the Quakers Hill Nursing Home in 2011 also heard Roger Dean had previously vandalised a former boss's car.

Dean has been jailed for life for 11 counts of murder and eight counts of causing reckless bodily harm after he started the fire in the early hours of November 18 after being caught stealing drugs.

Police had questioned Dean, then agedÂ  35, about stealing prescription drugs just hours before he lit the blaze which gutted the nursing home in the far western Sydney suburb of Quakers Hill in the early hours of November 18, 2011.

The inquest heard that the nursing home had failed to check Dean's work references and did not make him undergo a mental health check.

Eleven residents aged between 73 and 90 died immediately and there were three further deaths due to injuries.

A coronial inqiury into the tragedy, which has opened in a Sydney court on Monday, has heard that the nursing home had employed Dean on the basis of out-of-date resume. He was also the head nurse on the night of the blaze.

Dean had made no mention of the fact that he had been suspended from a previous job because of his drug use.

Dean was drug affected while working at the St John of God Hospital, a private psychiatric care facility in the inner-western Sydney suburb of Burwood, in 2011.

A patient complained Dean couldn't administer her medication properly, had white froth around his mouth and struggled to speak.

Terrible memories: Ella Vikay (pictured, leaving Glebe Coroners Court on Monday) was among the relatives of the 14 victims who died as a result of the Quakers Hill Nursing Home fire who packed the public gallery for the first day of the coronial inquiry into the tragedy. Ms Vikay lost her mother in the fire which tore through the home in November, 2011, after it was deliberately lit by nurse Roger Dean, killing men and women aged between 73 and 96 years old

Sick history: Roger Dean is questioned by police about the fire he lit at Quakers Hill Nursing Home. An inquest has now revealed that Dean, who lit the fire hours after he was caught stealing drugs, had previously been suspended for arriving at work 'frothing at the mouth' from drugs, and had vandalised the car of another previous boss with nails and paint

No way out: An inquest into the November 2011 fire at Quakers Hill Nursing Home (pictured) in western Sydney which resulted in 14 deaths, has heard that the beds of residents couldn't be evacuated because of a narrow and illegally built ramp

A staff member later noticed he looked sedated, the inquest heard, and that Dean blamed the medication he was taking for a bipolar disorder.

For his Quakers Hill interview, Dean only listed recent employment was at a cheesecake shop where his flatmate had worked.

The inquest was told Dean had also poured paint over a previous employer's car and put nails in the tyres.

The five-day inquiry opened with relatives of the victims packing the public gallery of Glebe Coroner's Court.

Deputy state coroner Hugh Dillon described the fire as a 'rare and devastating' event.

The inquest heard the ramp which led from the Quakers Hill Nursing Home was too narrow to take beds, hampering evacuation of patients.

Among the patients residing in the home at the time of the fire were blind people, others confined to their beds and some with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, the inquest was told.

Evacuation hampered: a ramp which was too narrow for bedridden patients to be wheeled out hampered the rescue operation by firefighters after 80 people were trapped in the nursing home following the fire

Sentencing: Roger Dean is serving life in prison after admitting to the murders which happened after he deliberately lit the nursing home fire to cover up his drug theft

One woman resident had an amputated leg and was confined to a wheelchair, ABC News reported.

Mr Dillon said the inquest was not investigating Dean's criminal actions. He said the inquest would try to determine what lessons could be learned from the fire.

'The community is behind you,' he told the victims' families in the gallery. 'Our concerns are your concerns.'

Counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern, said a ramp at the home made it difficult for staff to manoeuvre beds when they were trying to evacuate more than 80 residents.

The ramp's problems may not have been properly addressed during fire safety training for staff, and the ramp was constructed without council planning permission.

Roger Dean was on night duty on November 16, 2011 when he set the fire.

CCTV captured Dean entering the treatment room, where medication is kept, 36 times. A later audit of the room found 237 tablets of Endone, a strong opiate-based pain medication, missing.

Police questioned him at the home hours before the blaze over allegations of stealing the drugs, to which he later pleaded guilty.

A nursing home staff member remarked she was scared to leave her staff alone with Dean, the inquest heard.

Ms Stern said Dean used a staff member's cigarette lighter to set a sheet on a bed on fire in two rooms in the nursing home.

He later appeared on television describing his efforts to rescue trapped people in the nursing home.

After the fire, Dean told journalists he had braved the smoke to rescue those trapped inside as the home's 88 residents were evacuated.

He said: 'I just quickly did what I could to get everyone out.'

Following the tragedy, NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins described the blaze as 'a firefighter's worst nightmare'.

He said: 'Turning up to a nursing home with elderly people who can't get themselves out of harm's way...

'Firefighters could not see their hands in front of their faces in the 
thick smoke so you can imagine what it was like for the elderly trying 
to escape.'

He said that firefighters had crawled 
into the building through the thick smoke, reaching up to feel into beds
 to establish if there was anyone there who they could rescue.

The fire was Sydney's worst nursing home disaster since 16 elderly residents died in a blaze in suburban Sylvania Heights in 1981.
