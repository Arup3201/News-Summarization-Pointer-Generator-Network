The head coach of Florida State University has told of the heartbreaking battle for his young son who suffers from a rare blood disorder.

Jimbo Fisher’s eight-year-old boy Ethan has Fanconi Anemia, a genetic illness which may not see him live beyond the age of 20.

As Fisher prepares to take his team to the BCS National Championship Game next week, he also campaigns to raise awareness of Ethan’s illness to improve his chances of making it to adulthood.

Although his team is undefeated this season - the FSU Seminoles have won all 13 games this year – Mr Fisher’s greatest success is that it has raising the profile of Fanconi Anemia.

The family discovered that Ethan was ill in 2010 when Jimbo's wife Candi took their youngest son to an urgent care clinic with flu. A blood test revealed a low platelet count and after follow up tests Ethan was diagnosed.

‘All we knew about the disease was what we looked up online,’ Mr Fisher told CNN.

‘It was all the worst-case scenarios. We thought it was a complete death sentence. That day was... devastation.’

Nearly all Fanconi Anemia sufferers require a bone marrow transplant, but although it buys time, it does not cure the illness and the recovery time can be up to a year. The average lifespan for a Fanconi Anemia patient is 20 to 30 years.

‘Time isn't really on our side, or anybody's side, with this disease,’ Mrs Fisher says.

Since the Fishers went public with Ethan's diagnosis in 2011, all Florida State Union players have signed up to become bone marrow donors, and several have already helped children in need by donating.

Blood disorder Fanconi Anemia affects 1 in 350,000 births.

Sufferers have a genetic defect in their DNA repairm resulting in production of faulty cells, which can lead to birth defects, cancer and bone marrow failure.

They also run a 15,000 higher risk of developing blood cell cancer acute myeloid leukemia and 90 per cent need bone marrow transplants before the age of 30.

They have also set up a charity foundation, Kidz1stFund, which has given more than $1.5 million to a program at University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital helping sufferers from Fanconi Anemia.

In September this year, Flordia State University and University of Pittsburgh played a televised Labor Day game wearing ‘I fight Fanconi’ decals on their helmets.

‘We thought, we can go private with this and keep it within, or we can go out publicly and not only help Ethan, but help all those kids who don't have a voice, whose dads aren't the head football coach,’ Mr Fisher told CNN.

To date, Kidz1stFund has given more than $1.5 million to a program at University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital helping sufferers from Fanconi Anemia.
