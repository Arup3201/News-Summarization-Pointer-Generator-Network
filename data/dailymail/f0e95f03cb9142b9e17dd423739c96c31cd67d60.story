Do you know your ‘if’ statements from your ‘for’ loops?

If so, you might have a shot at the world’s first job advert written entirely in code.

Created by London-based Woto, the advert is looking for a creative designer to join the company - but they’ll need to be adept at coding to apply.

A new London-based website called Woto has a job listing written in code (shown). It claims to be the first ever advert for employment of this sort. Applicants will need to crack the programming language in order to apply. The move is designed to highlight the growing important of coding in the UK

According to the IB Times, the co-founder and CEO of Woto Ian Collins said a standard job advert would not have been good enough to ‘separate the wheat from the chaff’.

Co-founder Ekin Caglar added: ‘As a company embracing the future, we want to employ young people who can “talk our talk” but also learn and develop at the same rate as the technology around us.’

Under the new curriculum, children aged five will have to recite poetry by heart, 11-year-olds will sit maths exams without calculators and teenagers will study at least two Shakespeare plays.

Computer programming will be taught from five to 14, and foreign languages will be made compulsory at primary school.

There will be a new emphasis on spelling and grammar, and history will focus on the story of Britain.

The more traditional curriculum is the culmination of a four-year campaign started by Michael Gove. His successor Mrs Morgan has pledged to continue the drive. 

Part of the coded message reads: ‘Woto’s creators are after a savvy tech/digital intern, to help them make Woto whirl over the next few months.

‘The role would be a varied one and enable you to hone your skills in a number of areas, from copywriting to coding.’

And they add: 'We are expecting a Woto page from you with your application to this email.' 

Speaking to MailOnline, Sophie Kurta from Sense Communications, who is handling the launch of the site, said there was a possibility more such job listings may go live in future as it is a ‘fun way of doing job adverts.’

She explained that as coding in schools in the UK is becoming a bigger issue, with it now on the curriculum for primary and secondary school pupils, the advert was seen as a good way to keep up with the times.

Woto, which launched earlier this month, is a platform for people to share content such as recipes and flat listings.

It currently has a user base of 10,000, with the site set to ramp up its activity in the coming months.

 Mr Collins added to MailOnline that Woto was a website builder of sorts but with the ease and simplicity of social media.

Anyone can sign up and create their own space by logging onto the site.

'You can use it when you want to produce a page but don't want the commitment of a blog,' he explains. 

'If you wanted to complain about Ryanair, for example, where would you go to do that?

'You could use a website but would you want to do that?'
