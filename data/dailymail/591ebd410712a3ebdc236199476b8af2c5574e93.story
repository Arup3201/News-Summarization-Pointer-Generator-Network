More than 70,000 people enthusiastically cheered for Pope Benedict XVI last night, as he drove through Berlin’s Olympic Stadium in his popemobile, greeting the faithful and kissing several babies.

'Looking into the wide expanse of the Olympic Stadium, which you are crowding in such a great number, fills me with great joy and confidence,' he told the crowd in Germany.

Built by the Nazis for the 1936 games, the Pope held an open-air service at the stadium, on his first state visit to his homeland, which saw him being greeted by dozens of Roman Catholics earlier in the day.

Benedict urged the crowd not to view the church merely 'as one of many organisations within a democratic society', but as the source of their salvation.

The faithful appeared moved as they left after the service held in German and Latin.

'It was beautiful. The service surpassed all my expectations,' said Heidi Frank, 49, who had travelled 310 miles from the southern German city of Regensburg to see the pope.

'The atmosphere was impressive - the entire community praying, you don’t get that every day,' said Jaqueline Hoehns, 21, from Berlin.

After the Bavarian-born pontiff, 83, was met at at Berlin’s Tegel airport by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Christian Wulff earlier in the day, the pope also addressed Germany’s parliament in the historic Reichstag building.

He warned that politicians must not

as a lesson in history.

Amid scattered protests outside and a boycott by some lawmakers, Benedict began his first state visit to Germany on Thursday in a bid to stem the tide of Catholics leaving the church while acknowledging the damage caused by the clerical sex abuse scandal.

The Pope spoke for 20 minutes in the Reichstag, which was torched in 1933 in an incident used by Hitler to strengthen his grip on power.

'We Germans know from our own experience' what happens when power is corrupted, Benedict said, describing Nazis as a 'highly organised band of robbers, capable of threatening the whole world and driving it to the edge of the abyss'.

But he said even under the Nazi dictatorship resistance movements stuck to their beliefs at a great risk, 'thereby doing a great service to justice and to humanity as a whole'.

He also urged all Germans not to ignore religion.

'Even today, there is ultimately nothing else we could wish for but a listening heart - the capacity to discern between good and evil, and thus to establish true law, to serve justice and peace,' he said.

Benedict also voiced strong support for Germany’s ecological movement, calling it 'a cry for fresh air which must not be ignored or pushed aside'.

After the speech, he met with a 15-member Jewish delegation, noting that it was in Berlin that the annihilation of European Jews was organised.

'The supposedly "almighty" Adolf Hitler was a pagan idol, who wanted to take the place of the biblical God,' Benedict said. according to a prepared text.

In parliament, Speaker Norbert Lammert welcomed the Pope, noting that the last time there was a pontiff of German origin Germany didn’t yet even exist as a state.

'Germany is a country that over centuries was strongly marked by religion and religious wars,' Lammert said.

'A country whose Christian traditions of belief also influence the constitution we have today.'

But flagging Christian influence in Europe was one of Benedict’s key themes.

'We are witnessing a growing indifference to religion in society,' he said at a formal welcoming ceremony at the German president’s Bellevue palace.

He called religion a foundation for a successful society and said its values were essential for freedom.

Benedict said the presidential palace, which was destroyed in World War II, was a reminder of German history.

'A clear look at the past, even at its dark pages, enables us to learn from it and to receive an impetus for the present,' the Pope said.

When the Pope was met on a red carpet at the start of his four-day, Howitzers fired a ceremonial salute as the pope stepped off his plane, and Eurofighter jet escorts flew overhead.

Merkel introduced the pope to members of her Cabinet. He then greeted members of the German Catholic Church and children who stood waiting for him with small yellow-and-white Vatican flags and presented him with a bouquet of flowers.

Benedict, who was born Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger in Marktl and was appointed the head of the Roman Catholic Church in April 2005, blessed the children before moving on, accompanied by Merkel and President Wulff to his car.

A tiny group of about 20 protesters stood outside the airport, holding banners with slogans saying 'against anti-Semitism, sexism and homophobia' and 'my body, my choice'.

The Pope is scheduled to speak later today in parliament, which many lawmakers have vowed to boycott in protest over what they consider a violation of Germany's separation of church and state.

Another 10,000 people are expected to demonstrate outside.

The Vatican's views on contraception, the role of women, homosexuality and its handling of the sexual abuse scandal that rocked Germany last year are seen by many in Germany as outdated and out-of-touch.

On the plane, the pope told reporters that he found demonstrations were acceptable as long as they remained civil.

'(They are) normal in a free society and in the secularised world,' he said.

Meanwhile, in a telegram to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano ahead of a visit to his native Germany he also called for an 'ethical renewal' in Italy, where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is battling a scandal over his notorious Bunga Bunga parties, alleged to be awash with prostitutes and showgirls.   

The pope expressed his 'hope of an ever-more intense ethical renewal for the good of beloved Italy'.

The pontiff made no direct reference to the sex scandal which has engulfed the 74 year-old premier in recent days just as financial troubles have raised fears of a Greek-style debt crisis, but his comments carried a clear resonance amid a barrage of newspaper coverage of the goings-on.

In Germany the pope has planned meetings with leaders of Germany's Jewish and Muslim communities, three Masses, an ecumenical service with Lutheran church members and possibly meetings with victims abused by priests.

He told journalists on his journey from Italy that there needs to be an examination of why people have been leaving the church recently, and the part that the abuse scandals played in the phenomenon.

'I can understand that some people have been scandalised by the crimes that have been revealed in recent times,' he said.

More than 250,000 people are registered to attend his Masses during his visit.
