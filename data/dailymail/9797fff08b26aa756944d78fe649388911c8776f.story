A drinker from Idaho could be slapped with a $1,000 fine and a year in jail after allegedly calling 911 a dozen times about an overcharged bar tab that was actually correct.

According to authorities, Phillip Poissonnier of Post Falls was given a ride home by police around 1am on Monday after being thrown out of Club Tequila when he was ten beers in.

But instead of going to bed after getting dropped off, he reportedly made 12 emergency calls, the first wanting officers to come back to discuss his $30 bar tab.

In the second call, at 1:47am, he asked when the officers would be at his home.

And when he dialed 911 for a third and fourth time he merely let the phone ring before putting it down.

Along with hanging up, Poissonnier put the phone  to the radio, with dispatchers listening to a total of three songs.

The final time Poissonnier called police he apparently told responders that they were just like his ex-wife. 

The alleged prank-caller now faces fines that are likely to be much more.than the $30 check he was originally disputing.

And in fact, it appears he was kicking up a fuss for no reason.

A Club Tequila bartender showed Possonnier's receipts to KXLY TV, which show he was correctly charged around $30 for the ten beers that he ordered.

Commenting on the incident, Post Falls Police Captain, Pat Knight, said: '[He] really started to take away from other citizens in the city who really have an emergency.

'The consequences can be a $1,000 fine and year in jail, or both.' 

Police say Poissonnier faces a misdemeanor citation over misusing 911.

The culprit couldn't be reached by The Associated Press on Tuesday.
