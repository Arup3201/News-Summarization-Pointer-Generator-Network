Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, pictured in 2009, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

Five years after he became an object of national scorn, former policeman Drew Peterson is about to go on trial on charges that he murdered Kathleen Savio in 2004.

He has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for her death, and is the chief suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife Stacy, who has never been found.

The case, which begins Monday with jury selection, is sure to rekindle memories of the media frenzy that engulfed Peterson before his arrest, when he often joked with an army of news crews camped outside his house and even invited Geraldo Rivera into his kitchen.

Reporters from around the country and maybe from as far away as Japan will descend on a courthouse in Joliet to watch the latest chapter of a story that has already spawned a couple of books and a cable TV movie starring Rob Lowe as Peterson.

The frenetic coverage 'absolutely has the possibility of reigniting,' said Mark Geragos, a prominent California defence attorney who has been at the centre of comparable firestorms, including when he represented Scott Peterson (no relation), a California man convicted of murdering his young wife and unborn child.

Prosecutors expect to tell a relatively simple story: Drew Peterson killed his ex-wife to keep her from making off with much of his money in a contentious divorce. Sometime around February 29, 2004, according to the indictment, Peterson went to Savio's house and in the bathroom caused her 'to inhale fluid,' killing her.

Observers say Peterson may benefit from the three years he's been behind bars and out of the public eye, if only because he spent much of the past three years in solitary confinement, with his only human contact being from guards bringing him meals.

'He really was becoming one of the more hated individuals in America,' Joe Tacopina, a prominent defence attorney in New York, told the AP. 'Because he was in jail, he took himself off the front page, and that can only help him with a jury pool.'

Peterson's attorney agreed. 'Nobody's going to deny that Drew's relatively goofy behaviour rubbed people the wrong way,' said Joel Brodsky, who explained Peterson's actions as both the by-product of a sometimes grim job and his way of moving on after his wife left him.

'The fact that he hasn't been at that for a period of years certainly helps some of his past antics fade from memory.'

But that simple story is complicated by what happened after Savio's body was discovered by a friend of Peterson's. Peterson had called the friend to the house to look for Savio, saying he was worried.

The investigation unfolded nothing like the ones jurors may have seen on television programs such as 'CSI' and 'Law & Order.'

Detectives are expected to testify, 
as they did at a hearing in 2010, that nobody collected a single 
fingerprint or hair fibre at the house. They will likely acknowledge 
that Savio's relatives, who could have told investigators about the 
couple's on-going battles, were never interviewed.

Jurors
may also hear, as a judge did at the 2010 hearing, that Peterson was 
allowed to sit in on a police interview with Stacy Peterson as a 
'professional courtesy.' This happened while officers were trying to 
confirm Peterson's whereabouts the weekend Savio died.

The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.'

Instead
he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with 
women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed 
after getting married.'

Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right

Authorities then reopened the 
investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen 
Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her 
bathtub.

But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle.

Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail.

During the 30 minute interview in the jail's visitor centre, Peterson 
spoke about his children claiming to be a good father.

He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had
killed their mother because they knew he had not.

He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation.

They
are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first 
marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages.

When asked if he missed Stacy he said
he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would
do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers.'

He
said his last girlfriend Christina Raines has asked him to marry her 
three years ago, but he had not seen her since she had become 
intimidated by the press.

Last year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14.

Diana Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed.

He also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases.

In
letters, obtained by the National Enquirer, he wrote to her: 'I just 
think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body 
against mine...I want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours.

'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.'

Peterson
spoke to Miss Grandel about the disappearance of his fourth wife, 
sticking to his story that she walked out on him, saying she could have 
all her clothes.
