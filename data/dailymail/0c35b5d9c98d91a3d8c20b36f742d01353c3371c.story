A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria.

The unnamed 32-year-old  Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa.

The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group.

The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning.

It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS.

According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria.

Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. 

Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued.

Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. 

After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since.

Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa.

The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.

West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit.

It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation.

A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group.

They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned  on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.
