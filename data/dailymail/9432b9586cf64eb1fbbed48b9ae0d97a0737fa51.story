Floyd Mayweather put all the fighting talk to the back of his mind as he relaxed on courtside at Staples Center in Los Angeles to witness some NBA action with his daughter. 

Home side LA Lakers were on the losing end in front of boxing great Mayweather, who briefly took some time out to catch up on business on his mobile phone.

Goran Dragic scored 24 points and Eric Bledsoe added 22 as the Phoenix Suns beat the Lakers 116-107 despite Kobe Bryant's return after a three-game absence.

The Suns (18-14) pulled away in the third quarter where they outscored Los Angeles 33-25 for their sixth straight victory.

Bryant had 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers (9-22), who lost their third straight.

Floyd Mayweather is set for an eventful 2015, with potential fights against Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan both possibilities.

The Pretty Boy is yet to accept the challenge of British boxer and former light welterweight champion Khan, who proved his worth after beating Devon Alexander earlier this month.
