Universities Minister David Willetts has admitted that they government 'got the maths wrong' on tuition fees

The controversial £9,000-a-year tuition fees policy risks costing taxpayers more than the old system, new figures reveal.

Writing off unpaid student loans is becoming more expensive than under the £3,000-a-year fees regime.

The prospect is highly embarrassing for the Coalition, which claimed the higher fees would save at least £1billion a year.

It would be particularly devastating for the Lib Dems if it emerged their U-turn on tuition fees was in vain. They reneged on an election pledge to resist higher fees to get the reforms through Parliament.

Opposition politicians yesterday said the policy was fast becoming a ‘money pit’ and descending into ‘chaos’.

Since autumn 2012, universities have been able to charge fees of up to £9,000 a year – up from £3,375.

Students can take out Government-backed loans to cover the fees but must start repaying once they are earning £21,000 a year.

Ministers initially estimated loan write-off costs would be  28 per cent of the £10billion lent to students each year.

But with earnings forecasts now bleaker due to the economic climate, Universities Minister David Willetts has revealed the figure is 45 per cent.

The figure ‘reflects our current estimate of the costs of Government of the higher education subsidy to students’, he added in response to a Parliamentary written question.

When write-off costs reach 48.6 per cent the new system will become dearer than the old one, say experts at the consultancy London Economics.

Last night a former political adviser to Mr Willetts told the Guardian there should be a rethink of the system and admitted the Government ‘got its maths wrong’ by overestimating the amount of student debt that will be repaid.

The spiralling cost of writing off unpaid student debt is becoming worse than under the old £3,000-a-year system

Nick Hillman, who worked for Mr Willetts during the introduction of the policy, called for action to address the ‘big funding gap’.

The former adviser, now director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: ‘The thing that hasn’t really entered the debate yet … is now we know how big the shortfall is, what do you do about it?

'How much would you need to change the loan system to actually solve the problem?

‘I’m not defending the Government. The Government has got the maths wrong, plus the economy has changed. The £21,000 repayment threshold is in real terms much higher than the Government expected.’

Shadow Education Minister Liam Byrne said: ‘This is fresh evidence that our university system is turning into a money pit.

'The system is haemorrhaging cash that will never be repaid and reinvested in the next generation. It’s time to call a halt to this descent into chaos.’

The figures raise the spectre of measures to recoup cash, such as higher interest rates for graduates paying back loans or further cuts to university budgets.
