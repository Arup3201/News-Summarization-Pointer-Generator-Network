Victim: Kevin Ssali was stabbed to death as he got off a bus in South London

A 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death as he got off a bus has been named by police.

Kevin Ssali was attacked as he stepped off the vehicle in Lee, South London, at about 9.45pm on Saturday.

The teenager, from South Norwood, was taken to hospital but died from his wounds.

A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place at Greenwich mortuary on Monday afternoon.

Kevin is believed to have been travelling on a route 202 bus through Lee Green towards Charlton.

The attack happened about 500 yards from the spot where another teenager, 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen, was murdered in 2008.

Jimmy's father Barry Mizen, who has campaigned against teen crime, appealed for witnesses to the killing to come forward.

He said: 'This killing came as a great shock to myself and my wife Margaret and our hearts go out to the family of this young man.

'We actually do understand where they are going to be.

'We are always looking for answers but we would say let’s have a calm response to this.

'I would ask for witnesses to come forward because in Jimmy’s death the witnesses made the difference.

'The first instance is for witnesses to come forward and the judicial process to take its course, to identify the perpertrators and prosecute them. That has to happen.'

Asked whether the problem of teen violence had changed since Jimmy's death, Mr Mizen replied: 'Has it changed? The actual figures reflect that there are less deaths.

'But what hasn’t changed is the attitude which is still prevalent, where you get to a stage where it’s quite okay to actually kill somebody.

'It’s about changing people’s attitudes. We need to stand together and say "this isn’t good enough, we don’t want to live in a society where people kill each other - we don’t want to live in communities which are blighted by violence".

'This latest death make me even more determined. We have achieved great things and the actual figures have gone down, for whatever reason.

'But there are still some people who are prepared to go to these lengths to actually take a life, which is outrageous when you think about it.

'Things like this make myself and my wife more determined to work for peace in our communities.'

Grief: Floral tributes are laid at the scene where Kevin Ssali was stabbed at about 9.45pm on Saturday

Detectives investigating Kevin's death have arrested three teenagers on suspicion of murder.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'As the victim alighted the bus in Burnt Ash Road, he was attacked and stabbed.

'Officers are trying to establish if there was some sort of altercation on board the bus which led to the incident.'

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, from the Met's homicide and serious crime command, said: 'I am appealing for anyone who travelled on the route 202 bus on its way through the Lee area just before 9.45pm on Saturday night to speak to my officers.

'Did you witness an altercation or argument involving a group of male youths?

'I would also like to speak to anyone who was in Burnt Ash Road, where the victim got off the bus.

'I need to know what the series of events were which culminated in a 14-year-old boy losing his life.'
