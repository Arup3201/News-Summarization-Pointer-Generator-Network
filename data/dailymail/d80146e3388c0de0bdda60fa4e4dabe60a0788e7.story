Transformer can be used by people of any gender or sexual persuasion. The Swedish inventors hope it will change how people use sex toys forever

The inventors are hoping the product, which is waterproof, USB-rechargeable and available for £79, will change how people use sex toys forever. 

Mauricio Garcia, PicoBong Head of Marketing, said: 'There are toys for singles, for couples, for men and for women, but never before has anyone created a toy for everyone. 

The Transformer aims to awaken sexual exploration and make people realise they don't need to be confined by the labels placed on them.'

The website claims: 'The Transformer doesn't care if people are gay, straight, bi, monogamous, polyamorous, trans or cisgender.

'It only cares that people embrace their sexuality and explore it, perfect for her, him, her & him, him & him, her & her, them & them.' 

The team of young Swedish tech-inventors claim they started to build the prototype after becoming frustrated with the products on offer in traditional sex shops. 

The website says: 'When you go shopping for a sex toy, you’re faced with a lot of very linear, very clearly defined choices. “This is for the G-spot”. “This is for couples”. “This is for him”. “This is for her”. And so on.

'But the truth is, that kind of approach doesn’t suit everybody, and there are a lot of us who want a sex toy that transcends the same boundaries that we do during sex. 

'We want a single brilliant sex toy to do a thousand different things, rather than a thousand different sex toys, each brilliant for a single thing.'

'That’s why we’ve made the Transformer.'

Opinions were mixed about the new product on Twitter though. 

One user was more concerned with its appearance, writing: 'Transformer makes me think of those really long bendy pencils. 

Another wrote: 'That looks... Interesting! Nice to see more gender-neutral toys on the market!'

And one person was convinced their claims to be the first gender-neutral toy was a stretch of the truth, saying: 'Just saw something advertising the worlds first gender neutral sex toy. All sex toys are gender neutral!'
