A sixth-generation Pennsylvania undertaker is stirring up controversy among conservatives on social media, using jokes and crude humor to discuss death and the preciousness of life.

Caleb White, a married father-of-one who runs a funeral home in Parkesburg, Chester County, first hit headlines in November by saying on Twitter that he always ties the shoelaces of the dead together because if there's ever a zombie apocalypse it would be 'hilariious'.

The post went viral, retweeted more than 6,000 times, and even prompted a call to the police.

'He (the caller) actually thought we were doing that,' Wilde told Philly.com.

Creating dialogue: Sixth-generation funeral director Caleb Wilde uses occasionally-inappropriate social media posts to 'shed light on an industry that for the most part is cast in shadows'

Wilde's commentary as won him an avid following and national acclaim for shining light on a dark subject in a away that is both hilarious and heartfelt.

His blog, Confessions of a Funeral Director, gets 600,000 to 1 million hits a week, and he has more than 17,000 followers on Twitter.

Wilde refuses to take money for discussing death and offering his opinion, despite appearing on 20/20 and NBC News, as well as in TIME magazine and the Huffington Post.

'Funeral directors are too often seen as opportunists who are looking to take advantage of people in their weakest moments,' Wilde wrote on his site.

'I am not one of those funeral directors . . . this website exists (so that) people can share freely and honestly without fear of ulterior motives or profiteering.

'I want to start a conversation about death.

'A main part of our humanity is our mortality.

'Death makes us realize how precious and fleeting life is and how much each day is a gift.'

Wilde grew up playing hide and seek in the casket room of his family's funeral home in Parkesburg, the only mortuary in this rural town of about 3,600.

By 16, he was mowing its lawn, parking cars during services and accompanying relatives on calls to pick up bodies.

Death has always been at the core of the family, with the first Wilde's making their first caskets in 1850.

Wilde's grandfather Thaddeus, who was born in the funeral home, was embalming bodies by age 12.

Wilde's mother and father were each from families that ran competing funeral homes.

But Wilde didn't want to follow his ancestors into the family business and became a minister.

'The act of rebellion for a funeral director is to seek something that's surrounded by life,' he said.

However he eventually returned to the mortician business and said his commitment grew with each drive to pick up a body and each conversation he had a grieivng family.

He realized the need and importance of funeral directors in the grand scheme of things, especially in a rural setting.

'It's who I am,' he said.

Wilde says he uses the humor his posts online and writing on his blog as therapy for the grimness of his work, and openly discusses taking antidepressants.

He says that the format of Twitter is perfect because too much talk of death is too heavy for people to take.

'We want to take death in pieces, small pieces, anything bigger is too big to handle,' he said.

Besides zombie jokes and photos of pimped-out hearses, Wilde also aims to 'shed light on an industry that for the most part is cast in shadows'.

That means essays on topics like funeral director 'burnout and compassion fatigue', funeral etiquette (including a post defending funeral 'selfies'), consumer rights (like Do Funeral Homes Charge Too Much for their Services?) and a 'You Want to Be a Mortician? 21 Tips' post.
