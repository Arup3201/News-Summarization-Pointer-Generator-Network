Wayne Rooney was among those wishing fans merry Christmas on Twitter after Louis van Gaal went against the norm and gave his squad of stars  the day off.

Rooney was joined by team-mates Radamel Falcao, David De Gea and Juan Mata as they gave  their best wishes 24 hours before their match against Newcastle United on a mouth-watering Boxing Day fixture list.

Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko joined in but, with both injured for their match against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns, what they'll want most is three points.

The AON Training Complex in Carrington  will remain a ghost town on Thursday after Van Gaal did what predecessors David Moyes and Sir Alex Ferguson didn't, and told his players to stay at home.

With Christmas Day training cancelled and the stars not having to report for duty until Friday morning, they took the chance to celebrate the festive season in style.

Among those was Mata, who took selfies to another level by snapping a photo of himself in a bauble and writing: 'Merry Christmas to everyone!!' 

Elsewhere, Southampton's James Ward-Prowse didn't beat around the bush in admitting what present he is after most, as he wrote: 'Let's all get three points on Boxing Day.' 

Andrea Pirlo and his Juventus team-mates took a selfie with Santa Claus, too, during training, with their next Serie A match coming on January 6 against Inter Milan.
