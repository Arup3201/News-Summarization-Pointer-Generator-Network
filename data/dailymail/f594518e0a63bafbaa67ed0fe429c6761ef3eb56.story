Ritual: Chun Michael Deng died after being knocked unconscious during a fraternity hazing during a retreat

The hazing death of a college freshman during a fraternity retreat has been officially ruled a homicide.

Now the frat brothers who made him to carry sandbags and get tackled while blindfolded may face murder charges.

The
 move comes more than two months after Chun 'Michael' Deng was found 
dead in a rented home in the Poconos where members of Baruch College's 
Pi Delta Psi fraternity went on a retreat in early December.

'A lot has been done to this point,' Pocono Mountain Regional Police Chief Harry Lewis told NBC.

'In
 a case like this where so many people were involved, we want to make 
sure every possible witness is located and interviewed.'

None
 of the 'brothers' in question have been identified publicly and charges
 have yet to be filed but the classification as a homicide indicates 
that there is more to come.

Deng,
 19, was injured during a hazing ritual called the 'Glass Ceiling,' 
where people are blindfolded and made to carry 20 pounds of sand in a 
back while the other fraternity brothers tackled him.Â 

Mr Deng was tackled one too many times, he lied in the snow unresponsive after being knocked unconscious after hitting his head.

Fraternity
 brothers are believed to have carried him inside where they set him 
down and changed his clothes as others looked up his symptoms on the 
internet, police said.

Deng 
was reported to be unconscious and unresponsive immediately after he 
fell... Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued 
to be unresponsive,' said the affidavit.

'Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive.'

They
 did not take Mr Deng to a hospital for more than an hour, and when the 
group finally arrived at the hospital he was declared brain dead.

Quick
 to realize they had a problem on their hands, brothers from Baruch 
frantically removed fraternity-related items from the Pennsylvania home,
 police said.

Members of the
 fraternity had initially said Mr Deng had hurt himself while wrestling 
in snow outside the rented property, about 100 miles from the Manhattan 
campus.

The national 
fraternity administrators ended their association with Baruch, cutting 
off the chapter as a result of the fatal hazing incident.
