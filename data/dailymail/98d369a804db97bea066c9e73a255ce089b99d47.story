An Indonesian housemaid who murdered a four-month-old baby by bashing its head on a wooden table has had her death penalty upheld and her final appeal rejected.

The defendant, named only as S.T., was accused of killing the child, Malak, out of jealousy of her Filipino nanny last year.

Home security cameras captured the chilling moment the maid took the child out of its crib before returning its battered body four minutes later.

An Indonesian housemaid who murdered a four-month-old baby by bashing its head on a wooden table has had her death penalty reinstated by a court in Abu Dhabi

It is believed that the baby's head was bashed against a table at the family home in Abu Dhabi, reports Gulf News.

It was said she carried out the extraordinary attack on Malak - whose name means 'angel' - to get at her colleague, according to The National.

The child's nanny, a Filipino woman, was in the shower at the time and came back to the sight of the injured baby struggling to breathe. 

She was rushed to the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in the city, where doctors diagnosed her with a fractured skull and severe brain damage. 

She died on April 28 2013 - two weeks after the attack.

In an attempt to frame her, the maid initially blamed Malak's nanny for the death - but admitted her guilt when she was presented with video footage of her actions.

Prosecutors said that she resented her colleague because it was her job to care for Malak and her brother, while the convicted woman had to care for a sick grandmother. 

The defendant had already been sentenced to death after being found guilty at the Criminal Court of First Instance.

But The Appeals Court then announced that it was cancelling the Criminal Court's verdict of the death sentence because it was invalid as S.T.'s defence was not serious enough.

Defendants facing life in jail or the death penalty are entitled to a lawyer appointed by the court. The court is then responsible for monitoring the appointed lawyer's performance to see if they attend hearings, follow the case and present a 'serious defence'.

The Appeals Court said that the defence attorney representing S.T. in the Criminal Court of first instance was not serious in presenting the defence and therefore the verdict that sentenced her to death was invalid.

However, that verdict was upheld by the first Appeals Court to look at S.T.'s case, before being cessated, bounced back to the Appeals Court, and upheld for a second time.

Since the baby's family has insisted on the death penalty, the court sentenced her to death again.

The verdict is to be carried out in the presence of the child's family and in a method chosen by the President of the UAE.

All death sentences in the UAE are subject to two rounds of appeals, and if these both  fail the common method of execution is firing squad.
