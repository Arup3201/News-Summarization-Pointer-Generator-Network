Top lawyers last night greeted demands to explain their links to controversial private detectives with a wall of silence.

Dozens of Britain’s biggest law firms refused to say if they employ snoopers or what steps they take to ensure that the private eyes obey the law.

Industry insiders claim the use of detective agencies is commonplace in complex fraud, insurance and divorce cases. But the Daily Mail found a reluctance by more than 30 legal firms to discuss the issue or account for their actions.

Private eyes: Mystery surrounds the use of snoopers by legal firms, and few are answering questions

Among those who failed to comment were some of the most profitable  companies, including Clifford Chance, Linklaters and Freshfields. Other high-profile international firms such as Schillings, Carter-Ruck and Irwin Mitchell also failed to respond.

Of the handful of firms that did reply, most confirmed that they used private investigators when ‘it is in our clients’ interests to do so’.

One insisted ‘we expect that they operate fully within the parameters of the law’, with no evidence of how this would work in practice.

The wall of silence came as police were urged to name those on a secret list of 102 firms and individuals who employed rogue detective agencies that broke the law by hacking, blagging and stealing sensitive personal information to order, in what has become known as the ‘blue chip’ hacking scandal.

Nothing but weasel words

The largest group of clients is made up of law firms, and MPs are angry that they and others have escaped scrutiny.

Critics called for an end to ‘double standards’ and for ‘arms-length involvement’ in criminal acts to be investigated rigorously.

They pointed out that law firms and others escaped police investigation while those accused of phone hacking were the subject of an open-ended multi-million pound inquiry.

As the Government finally announced that it will regulate private investigators, the Home Affairs Committee said it would haul back officials to explain the continued secrecy.

Keith Vaz: Wants to name names

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he remained determined to publish the names of those involved and will confront the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) again in September.

The agency, which will be replaced by the National Crime Agency in October, has been accused of protecting those named in its intelligence report on private eyes.

Mr Vaz said he could name names using Parliamentary privilege, but did not want to prejudice potential criminal inquiries.

He said MPs should not be part of a ‘secret squirrel club’ in which information in the public interest cannot be published.

Asked if Soca could keep ‘stringing along’ the committee, he added: ‘That is the balance. This list has been around for a number of years and nobody has done anything about it.

This can be cleared up quite quickly. You should ask the firms involved – did they know that the rogue investigators were getting illegal information, were they acting illegally?’

‘If yes, then you have to consider criminal liability. If no, then you cross them off. These companies, individuals and firms don’t even know they are on this list.’

The committee is writing to the top 100 legal firms and every FTSE 100 company to ask if they used private investigators.

Private investigators will need a licence to operate or face jail, Home Secretary Theresa May announced yesterday.

Before receiving a licence, they will have to pass a qualification and undergo background checks under rules being brought in from September 2014.

Operating without a licence will be a criminal offence carrying a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine.

Crucially, legitimate journalist investigations will not be covered.

Tory MP James Clappison, a senior member of the committee, said: ‘Now we’ve been told that the Government is going to regulate, it looks as if this will require an Act of Parliament.

‘If Parliament is going to debate this issue we need the maximum possible information.’ The Daily Mail contacted the top 20 UK law firms by gross earnings, as well as more than a dozen other high-profile companies to ask if they used private investigators.

The vast majority did not respond at all to inquiries by telephone and email, despite being given more than 48 hours to do so.

Linklaters, a sprawling global firm, said it was ‘not able to say anything’, while Freshfields said it did not want to prejudice any response to MPs.

A spokesman for major firm Allen & Overy defended its use of private investigators.

DLA Piper, which employs more than 4,000 lawyers in 30 countries, said it employed private eyes ‘when it is in our clients’ interests’.

Other firms said they could not reply because they employed so many staff in different offices that it was impossible to know what they are all doing.

Crackdown: Home Secretary Theresa May unveiled plans to force private investigators to obtain licences to operate, or face fines or even jail

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had a ‘lot of sympathy’ with MPs who believed those who used snoopers should be named.

He added that if ‘big companies and organisations’ were using investigators they ‘should be open about it’.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘These rogue investigators should be investigated fully – and arms-length involvement by companies in their crimes should be uncovered.’
