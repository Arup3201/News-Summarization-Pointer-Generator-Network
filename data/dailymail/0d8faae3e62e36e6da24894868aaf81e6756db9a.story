A heartbreaking photo of a dog standing guard over his dying companion has gone viral.

Passerby Michael Mason photographed Herman the Staffordshire Bull Terrier protectively watching over a female dog who'd been hit by a car on Sylvan Road in Atlanta.

'The look on his face. ‘Can someone help me?’ He was watching over him (sic) like a guard dog,' Mason told WSBTV.

Mason shared the image online calling on his friends for help.

The touching snap went viral after The Walking Dead actress Kylie Szymanski shared it on her Facebook fan page on July 18.

'Is there ANYONE in the Atlanta area who can use a new best friend?,' the 11-year-old star wrote. 

'This poor guy lost his best friend today and stood over her until they took him away. He is alone and scared and sad in a local shelter. Please let me know if you can help or know someone who can.'

While the female pooch died from her injuries, Herman is being cared for at Fulton County Animal Services.

He needs a new home, with animal officers describing him as friendly and loving.

'They do feel that companionship and 
when somebody is gone they miss them,' animal officer Kerry Moyers-Horton told WSBTV.

LifeLine Animal Project's Cicley Gay added: 'We are grateful someone stopped and 
cared enough to take a picture and share it to demonstrate the power of a
 dog's love. And this sweet animal didn’t leave his friend when she was 
injured.'

LifeLine is a shelter that works with Fulton County Animal Services.

Meanwhile Mason, from Georgia, said he would love to adopt Herman if his wife let him.
