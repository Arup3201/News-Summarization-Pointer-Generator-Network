This is the shocking moment a knife-wielding robber jacked a woman's car in a Spanish parking lot before making off with her baby sat on the back seat.

Terrifying CCTV footage shows the 34-year-old, named by his initials JAL, jumping into the passenger side as the woman clips herself into her seat belt outside the Parquesur shopping mall in Leganes, south of Madrid.

Police said he then ordered her to 'give him the car or else.'

A woman was threatened by a knife-wielding carjacker who stole her car with her baby on the back seat. Pictured is the mother loading her 16-month-old's pram into the car boot

Reasoning he could take the car after she'd removed her 16-month-old son from the rear, the woman reportedly tried to calm her attacker down.

When her request fell on death ears, however, she started screaming for help.

A fight broke out between the two and the man eventually succeeded in ejecting the woman from the vehicle, reports ABC.

With passersby coming to her rescue, the mother desperately clung to the door to try and stop the man from driving away. 

The mother and the man, 34, fight until the woman leaves the vehicle, desperately holding on to the door as passers-by come to her rescue

Hearing the woman's screams, more strangers run to the woman's assistance as the man reverses

One man is seen kicking the vehicle, while another thrusts his hand through the window to try and wrestle control of the steering wheel.

The thief, however, managed to drive off and pick up his girlfriend - a 29-year-old woman named only as TRL - outside the car park.

The pair then drove off, with the baby still inside, but abandoned the vehicle just a mile away.

Three men look on helplessly as the man drives away with the baby in the back. The thief and his girlfriend were arrested following the incident in December

National Police officers found the car, with the unharmed baby still inside, some minutes later.

Agents arrested the duo the following day after the incident in December - after identifying the man from fingerprints left inside the car.

The video was released by police at the weekend.
