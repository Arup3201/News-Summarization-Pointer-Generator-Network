A businessman was told yesterday he will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of the murder of his expectant wife in 2006.

Jason Young, 37, was retried for the crime after his first trial ended in a hung jury last June.

Young was found guilty of the first-degree murder of wife Michelle Young. The
29-year-old was five months pregnant with their second child, 
when she was found face-down in a pool of blood at their North Carolina 
home.

Quick decision: Jason Young was sentenced to life in prison without parole by a jury in North Carolina today at the retrial for the murder of his pregnant wife in 2006

The couple's two-year-old daughter, Cassidy, now 
seven, was in the house and found hiding in her parents' bed the 
next day, her bloody footprints surrounding the body. Michelle Young's 
sister, Meredith Fischer, found them.

Young had claimed that the 
night his wife was murdered he was 160 miles from home staying at a 
hotel in Hillsville, Virginia, while on a business trip.

The jury in Wake County, North Carolina deliberated for only six hours today before returning a guilty verdict at 3.48pm. Young will serve a life sentence without parole.

According to ABC, during final deliberations this morning, the jury 
requested a list of items entered into evidence to examine, including clothes worn by the family,
crime scene photos and Young's luggage from his business trip.

The salesman was jailed in 2009, but released on bond of $900,000 in July last year, after a jury failed to reach a verdict in his first trial.

In a civil lawsuit in 2009 a judge 
declared that Jason killed his wife Michelle, awarding her mother $15.6 million 
in compensation and punitive damages. Young was barred from receiving any 
life insurance payout or assets as a result of his wife's death.

Prosecutors described the attack, in 
which they say Michelle Young was hit at least thirty times on the head with blunt 
force, as 'brutal and personal'.

During the retrial, Chief Assistant District Attorney Howard Cummings said Jason Young was inconsistent when he recounted the night of his wife's death.

The jury also heard dramatic testimony from Michelle's sister Meredith who revealed that the couple's toddler spoke of her father 
during the 911 call.

Prosecutors pointed out that in the tape of the call, Cassidy could be heard in the background. During the call, Meredith Fisher asked the toddler what happened to her mother and if anyone had been in the house.

On the original call, Ms Fisher can be heard telling the dispatcher she didn't think the child understood what was happening.

'There on that day, when we were in 
the fire truck, she continued to talk about her father,' Ms Fischer said. 'And 
later when we got back to my house, a child psychologist was there, but 
she had just shut down.'

In happier times: Jason Young, shown with wife Michelle, said in his first trial that although he was not a exemplary husband he loved his wife and had nothing to do with her death

In his first criminal trial, in 2011,
prosecutors said that the businessman killed his wife because they were having 
marital problems, ABC News reported.

Two women took the stand to say 
they'd had extra-marital sex with Young in the months leading up to his 
wife's murder.

In his original trial Young made the unusual move of 
testifying in his own defence. Speaking though tears, he said that, 
although he was not a exemplary husband, he loved his wife and had no 
hand in her death.

But
in his first trial the prosecution argued that Young drove through 
the night to kill his wife Michelle, and then interfered with the hotel 
security devices to conceal his actions.

Jason
Young allegedly left the hotel through an emergency exit, wedging the 
door open so as to avoid using his key card to get back inside, 
prosecutors say.

'The defendant had a plan. His plan 
was to murder his wife, and his plan was to get away with it,' Holt told
jurors in the first trial.

This time around, the prosecution’s opening 
statement portrayed Young as an juvenile man who didn't want another 
baby, ABC News reported.

But the defence’s
opening statement argued that the state’s case was mainly circumstantial, and 
without direct evidence linking Young to the crime scene.

Attorney Mike Klinkosum conceded that the Youngs were having problems in their marriage, but argued that 
did not make Jason Young a killer.

Klinkosum said. 'I am not here to tell you that he was a good husband. He was far from it. He's acted like an 
obnoxious, juvenile jerk. But what you've got to remember ladies and 
gentlemen, is that we don't convict people of murder, just because they 
act like jerks.'

Meredith Fisher discovered her sister's lifeless body after getting a voicemail from Jason 
Young asking her to go to the house to look for some papers about an anniversary present for Michelle.

She told the court last month of the heartbreaking moment of finding her dead 
sister, with her small child nearby. She told the court: 'That's the 
small of her back, that I touched her and felt that she was cold.'

When
Fisher arrived at the Young house 'the dog was freaking out,' she said 
in the 911 call played back in court. Lights were on in the 
porch and the gate was open. When she got upstairs there was blood 
everywhere.  

Holt described the horrific scene that greeted Meredith: 'She
found little footprints in blood. She found them around Michelle’s 
head. She saw them as she was coming up the stairs in Cassidy’s 
bathroom. She found baby dolls. A baby doll by Michelle’s head.

And she heard Cassidy say, ‘Mommy’s got boo boos.'

Shelly Schaad, a former 
sorority sister of Michelle Young and the last person to see Michelle 
alive, also took the stand last month and painted an unflattering picture of the software salesman.

The couple's marriage was troubled and they fought openly, Ms Schaad told the court.

Following Schaad's testimony Elmer Goad,
the maintenance man from the Hampton Inn in Hillsville, where Young 
said he was staying, gave evidence about the night of the murder.

The hotel worker said he noticed a camera was unplugged at an emergency exit.

He
and Keith Hicks, the night clerk, got a ladder and reconnected it, the 
court heard. 'I’d say within an hour after that, we looked and it was 
pointing up at the ceiling and the wall,' he said. 'So I went back and 
checked it and somebody had hit it hard enough to knock it up toward the
ceiling.'

Goad said, in the nine years he had worked there, he'd 'never seen a camera messed with.'

Following
Goad's testimony, the court heard from a convenience store worker who 
said she saw Young at her gas station on the night of the murder.

Gracie
Dahms Calhoun gave crucial evidence that placed Jason
Young, not at his hotel, but between Hillsville and his home in 
Raleigh, on the night of the murder.

The store clerk remembered Young because he was angry that he had to come in to pay for his gas, the court heard.

'He kept hitting the buzzer,' she said. 'He kept trying and trying and I kept hitting ''ignore''.

'When
he came in to pay he started cussing and raising Cain and threw a 20 at
me and told me he would get 20 and walked out,' she said.

After
pumping in just $15 in gas he left. The store clerk identified Young and his car- a white SUV. Jason Young was driving a
white Ford Explorer on the night of the murder.

In
the initial trial the jury deliberated for three days before reaching 
deadlock. Eight jurors voted in favor of acquittal and four for 
conviction.
