Drivers are being driven around the bend by wonky white lines painted along the centre of a busy road.

But astonishingly bosses at Dorset County Council insist the road markings in Wimborne, Dorset. were painted deliberately wonky - as a safety measure to slow down traffic.

Jennifer Carpenter, a community 
carer, was perplexed when she spotted the wobbly lines while driving 
through the East Borough area of the town.

Adrian Norcombe, construction manager for Dorset County Council's highways department, insisted the wobbly lines were quite deliberate

Council road chiefs insist the lines are deliberate, forming part of a bizarre measure aimed at slowing down traffic in a notorious rat run

She said: 'It just struck me as really funny when I saw the lines.

'It's
 ludicrous. The road is a bit of a rat run anyway, particularly in the 
mornings, and there is always people driving along it, so I think 
there's going to be quite a lot of confusion.

'I can't logically explain how this has happened. It just makes the road narrower on the other side. It's crazy.'

Rather than the normal straight white lines running down the centre of the road, drivers are facing weird winding markings that wiggle down the carriageway

Driver Andy White, 28, said: 'I thought the person who painted them must have been drunk.

'If you stand at one end of the road and look down it the straight line in the middle goes off all over the place.

'If it is part of a traffic calming scheme then it has left me baffled.'

But Adrian Norcombe, construction manager for Dorset County Council's highways department, insisted the wobbly lines were quite deliberate.

He said: 'This road has recently been resurfaced as part of the defects programme.

'These markings were installed as part of a traffic engineering scheme.

'Our team have had a number of residents thank them as it helps to slow down traffic in a road that was previously considered a rat run.'

Mail Online asked Dorset County Council to provide figures to support the scheme's safety credentials but had not received any at the time of publication.
