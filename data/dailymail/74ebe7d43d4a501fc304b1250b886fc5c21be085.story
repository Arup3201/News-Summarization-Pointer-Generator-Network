He may have thought the worst of the Vegas ordeal was behind him as he tries to distance himself back in the UK from his partying antics.

But one lone source has claimed the nude strip billiards picture of the Prince is nothing compared with the rest of the story.

A single quote from an anonymous source, used by celebrity blogger Norm Clark on his Las Vegas gossip page, says: 'Something pretty gigantic' is involved; something more 
serious than 'strip billiards'.

Before the party: Prince Harry was snapped in Las Vegas admiring a tall blonde, who has been named as 27-year-old Danielle Davidson, before hosting a private party in his hotel room

The claim is the latest in a string of revelations to potentially tarnish the third-in-line-to-the-Throne's Royal image.

Last night, The Palace had no comment on the vague accusation.

After a nude photo of the Prince emerged last week from a private party in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Prince Harry has removed himself from Facebook, where he operated under the pseudonym Spike Wells.

Following advice from his private secretary,
 Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is heading an inquiry into the Prince’s 
trip to Las Vegas, Harry deleted his account.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that 
the Prince’s two best friends, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, 25, who joined him 
in Vegas, and Arthur Landon, 30, have also closed their Facebook 
accounts, as has one of his key Scotland Yard minders.

The latest comment to surface surrounding the 27-year-old's antics has no implicit context, but could be linked to concerns raised by the Prince following the US publication of the derobed heir. 

The Prince was said to be ‘terrified’ 
further damaging images might emerge and his concerns intensified after 
photos of an ‘even wilder’ week in the British Virgin Islands on Sir 
Richard Branson’s private island of Necker, shortly before the Vegas 
weekend, were leaked to a newspaper.

Pictures from the trip were originally posted on Facebook by one of Harry's friends.

Further pictures have emerged from Prince Harry's Las Vegas trip which followed immediately after the Necker sojourn.

The Prince is seen partying in swimming shorts, a hat and sunglasses, surrounded by bikini-clad women.

Harry, Inskip and rugby player Adam Bidwell, 36, were among his entourage who checked into a £5,100-a-night suite on the 63rd floor of one of the city’s most elite resorts.

'The
suite is in a tower that has its own private casino,' said a maid. 'It 
has mohair walls to absorb the sound, a pool and a wet bar.'

They ate and drank at the hotel's most exclusive bars and restaurants, including the most expensive restaurant, the SW Steakhouse, 
named after the complex’s owner Steve Wynn, who reportedly picked up the
£50,000 bill for their visit.

The rowdy group then moved on to one of 
the hotel’s nightclubs, Surrender, where they were ushered into the 
red-curtained VIP area.

They
are understood to have picked up two girls at the club for the party where the naked Prince was captured on fuzzy mobile phone shots and sold for £10,000
to the TMZ website.

At 1.30pm the next day, just seven-and-a-half hours after the now infamous 'strip billiard' game, Harry is believed to have hosted a second vodka-fuelled  pool party with a dozen ‘randomly recruited’ girls.

‘Girls were 
invited to come over and meet Harry,’ according to a source.

Scotland Yard minders looked on as the girls were ushered inside the private villa – or cabana – at the MGM Grand 
Hotel’s Wet Republic club, according to the source. The party went on for five-and-half-hours.

‘What
is incredible is that his detectives didn’t request any special 
security at Wet Republic,’ said the source. ‘They had no requirements 
whatsoever.

His handlers just sat around while friends went to 
neighbouring private areas that had been rented by rich guests, inviting
their girls to come over and meet Harry.
