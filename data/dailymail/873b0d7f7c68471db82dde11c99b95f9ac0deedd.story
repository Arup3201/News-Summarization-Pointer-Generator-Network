The cousin of a four-year-old girl who was kidnapped and murdered 16 years ago has launched a Facebook page in the hope of finally solving the grisly crime.

Angie Spade, 35, believes that reminding people on social media about Jessica Phelps and her 1997 death could jog the memory of someone who may know anything about the killing.

'It only takes one small, or seemingly small, detail to blow this cold case wide open,' Spade told Mlive. 'I don't want people to forget her.'

The four-year-old girl vanished from her home in Flint, Michigan on July 1, 1997 as she played outside while her mother was in the shower.

Mystery: Jessica Phelps, 4, was kidnapped and murdered in 1997 - and her killer has never been found

When her mother realized the little girl was gone, she frantically searched the neighborhood with friends and residents before alerting the police.

Friends handed out hundreds of flyers, restaurant employees wore 
t-shirts printed with her image and delivery vehicles pasted her 
photograph in their windows - but there was no sign of her.

Nine months later, on April 2, 1998, her
skeletal remains were found by a highways worker cleaning out a ditch 
in Atlas Township. Clothes resembling what she had been wearing were 
found nearby.

But her body was so badly decomposed and exposed to the elements that DNA evidence was unable to pinpoint her killer. No one has ever been charged with her death.

Her face appeared on Crime Stoppers and America's Most Wanted, and sparked tips from as far away as Hawaii.

Former Flint police Sgt. Gary Elford, 
who has since retired, previously told Mlive that 
authorities received a tip that she was possibly taken by a man in 
Tawas.

An investigator looked into the tip, and found a girl that looked just like 
Jessica - but she was missing the young girl's gap between her teeth.

As the years passed, tips became less frequent and other homicide cases meant that Flint investigators were unable to devote time to Jessica's case.

Adorable: The little girl was snatched from outside her home and her remains were found nine months later

Missed: Police have received tips from all over the country but 16 years on, her killer has still not been found

In November 2012, Spade launched the Facebook page, Justice for Jessica, and it has received more than 2,000 likes.

She
is hoping that the Facebook page will remind people of the case and be 
able to gather any information people have about the case.

Sgt.
Greg Hosmer with the Flint police said the investigation is still open 
and that tips continue to trickle in - even as recently as the end of 
last year.

Authorities still
have not determined how Jessica died due to the decomposition of her 
body, but Hosmer said he believes she was asphyxiated.

Hope: Angie hopes the Facebook page will encourage people to come forward with information

Solving these types of cases relies heavily upon people coming forward, he said.

'Relationships change,' he told Mlive. 'Someone could come forward and spill their guts.'

Anyone with information on Jessica's disappearance or death is asked to contact Flint police at 810-237-6800. Visit the Facebook page, Justice for Jessica.
