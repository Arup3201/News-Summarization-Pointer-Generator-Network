Gibbons, who filmed pupils as they changed for swimming, has been jailed for a year

A primary school teacher who filmed pupils as they changed for swimming was caught after a nine-year-old girl spotted his iPhone being held under the door, a court heard.

Christopher Gibbons, 26, used the handset to record the youngsters until he was seen by a student who told her mother.

Police later found images of two women he knew that he had also filmed without their knowledge as they showered separately in a private house.

The infant class teacher at a York primary school was jailed for 12 months at York Crown Court.

He was told he had abused the trust placed in him by the children he taught and supervised.

Gibbons, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to one charge of taking an indecent picture of a child and three of voyeurism.

He was jailed for 12 months and was put on the sex offenders' register for ten years.

Gibbons was also made subject to a sexual offences prevention order indefinitely controlling his use of the internet and electronic items that can take pictures and banned from ever working with children again.

Speaking after the hearing Detective 
Sergeant Jackie Smart said: 'Christopher Gibbons has completely abused 
an important position of trust and thankfully he will no longer be able 
to work with children again.

'Parents must be able to rely on adults whose children are put in their care.

Gibbons has proved that he cannot be relied on or indeed trusted with such responsibilities and his career is in ruins.

'Hopefully Gibbons' sentence will reassure parents that the local authorities will take appropriate action in cases such as these and offenders will be prosecuted.'

Defending, Andrew Stranex, said Gibbons had destroyed his career and his job but had helped the police to uncover all his crimes.

Joe Cocker, manager of City of York Safeguarding Children's Board, said: 'Christopher Gibbons betrayed the trust of the children in his care, their parents and his profession.

'The City of York Safeguarding Children's Board and City of York Council take any safeguarding allegations extremely seriously and work closely with North Yorkshire Police to ensure that the perpetrators are prosecuted.'

He said Gibbon was arrested and suspended as soon as concerns about his behaviour came to light and he thanked all involved in bringing the case to court.

He added: 'The result of this, and other high profile local and national cases, is that people feel more confident in coming forward with their concerns.'
