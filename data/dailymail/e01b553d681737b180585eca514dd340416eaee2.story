Free: Kristle Vandever, 44, has escaped criminal charges despite admitting to having sexual relations with students

An elementary school teacher who admitted having sexual relations with students has escaped prison after prosecutors declined to bring charges against her.

Kristle Vandever, 44, resigned two years ago after the allegations first emerged - but she has only just had her teaching licence revoked.

Shortly after quitting, the 21-year veteran wrote an email admitting: 'I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me.'

She also appeared to imply that she could have faced legal action if her victims had spoken up as she wrote, 'no witnesses coming forward'.

Vandever taught English as a second language at McNary Heights Elementary School in Umatilla, Oregon, having qualified as a teacher in 1989, according to the Hermiston Herald.

After an investigation into allegations she had had sex with students was launched in early 2010, she resigned from the school in May 2010.

Just weeks after her resignation, she sent an email from her work account saying: 'No jail for me and that is only because of luck... no witnesses coming forward.

'He said he was of legal age, but he lied. I just can't help wanting these hot young boys... and they want me.

'Who am I to spoil a young man's fantasy. Damn.'

However, after a lengthy police investigation, the local District Attorney declined to file criminal charges against Vandever.

The state's Teacher Standards and Practices Commission launched its own inquiry into the teacher's behaviour, and found a number of serious offences.

A report concluded that she had performed oral sex on 'one or more' students in her car, as well as giving students alcohol.

It also found that video of Vandever engaged in sexual activity with a boy was filmed on a cell phone and passed round other students.

Last month, the teacher had her licence withdrawn as a result of the findings.

She did not appeal against the revocation or the conclusions of the report.
