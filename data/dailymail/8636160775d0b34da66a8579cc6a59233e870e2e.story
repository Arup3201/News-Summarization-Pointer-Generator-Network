American protestors will join in protests in Pakistan against drone attacks to ‘apologise on behalf of those with a conscience’.

Campaigners from the anti-war group Code Pink, are visiting Pakistan to make contact with people affected by the drone strikes and draw the attention of the American public to the impact of attacks.

Organised in conjunction with a British advocacy group, the rally is to take place today in one of the Pakistani capital's busiest market places. The protesters will recite anti-drone chants, wear bright pink clothes and carry banners.

Medea Benjamin, one of the group’s founders said yesterday: ‘We are here to say, on behalf of those Americans with a conscience, that we apologize to the people of Pakistan for the killing and suffering (caused by the drones).’

The drone strike program in Pakistan has a controversial history, with conflicting reports on its impact from the U.S. government, Pakistani officials and independent organisations.

American officials insist that the choice and execution of the strikes, which begun under former President George W. Bush and ramped up under President Barack Obama, meet strict standards and that civilian deaths or injuries are extremely rare.

Drone attacks are said to have killed 
far more people than the United States acknowledges, traumatised 
innocent residents and been largely ineffective according to a study 
released last month by Stanford Law School and New York University's 
School of Law. Civilians account for a significant portion of those 
killed, the study said.

The drone program is deeply unpopular in Pakistan, where the national parliament voted in April to end any authorisation for it.

Code Pink's demonstration on Friday is the precursor to a bigger, more ambitious protest over drone strikes in which the group plans to participate over the weekend.

Pakistani politician Imran Khan insisted the march to the country’s restive tribal areas, where Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militants have strongholds, will happen as planned despite security fears and doubts over whether authorities would allow it.

Western journalists and anti-drone 
campaigners will join political party Pakistan Tekreek-e-Insaaf or 
Pakistan Movement for Justice (PIT), headed by Mr Khan, in a convoy from
Islamabad to South Waziristan at the weekend to protest against U.S. 
drone strikes.

The march, 
which includes the British head of charity Reprieve Clive Stafford Smith
and 30 American anti-drone campaigners, plan to visited areas where 
access is strictly controlled by Pakistan and independent access for 
foreigners is banned.

March will go on: Cricket legend turned politician Imran Khan insists the peach march against the use of U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan will go on despite conflicting reports of whether protesters will have access to restricted areas they plan to visit

There have been conflicting reports this week about whether protesters have permission to enter South Waziristan and if so, by whom but cricketing legend turned politician, Mr Khan, insists it will go on.

A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban told AFP that the umbrella militia, which is fighting an insurgency against the government and whose members are killed by U.S. missiles, had not yet formulated its position on the march but Mr Khan said the Taliban had given their agreement through intermediaries in the tribal areas.

He said: ‘The tribes have got in touch with the militants and the tribes have told us that it's fine, they have no objections to it

‘I still don't understand, why is the government going to stop us when they know neither the militants are objecting to this, neither the tribal areas are objecting to this and certainly the army's not objecting to this?’

According to The Daily Times, Mr Khan said: ‘Of drones I think two words – it’s immoral and it’s insane.

‘Immoral because you cannot justify eliminating suspects and insane because it’s counterproductive. ‘All it does is it turns more people against the US, hatred grows and the beneficiaries of this insanity are the militants.’

Mr Khan said the protesters, which plan 
to march to the village of Kotkai and rally there, will not be stopped 
if authorities intervene. They will just hold the rally wherever they 
are stopped.

Code Pink activists say that if the 
march is stopped, they will invite people from the area affected by the 
drone strikes to join them in a large gathering in Islamabad.

They say they are also considering the possibility of a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in the capital.

The women-led organisation became known for anti-war demonstrations in Washington during the U.S. build up in Iraq. The group has held protests over a range of different international issues.

They have regularly disrupted high-profile congressional hearings relating to war and national defence issues, as well as interrupting speeches by foreign officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.

Among the activists with the Code Pink delegation in Pakistan at the moment is Ann Wright, a former U.S. Army colonel and State Department official who quit her post to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

In an appearance this week on the Pakistani television station Geo TV, Wright said that U.S. drone strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and are fuelling anti-American sentiment in the region.

When the Pakistani television host asked Wright to respond to accusations that she was a radical activist, she said: ‘I'm a radical peace activist.’
