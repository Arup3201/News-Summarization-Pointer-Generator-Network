Bernie Ecclestone has led the tributes to John Button, the father of the 2009 Formula One world champion Jenson and one of motor racing’s most popular figures, who has been found dead at his home on the French Riviera. He was 70.

It was only six months ago that champagne glasses clinked in celebration of the man Jenson called ‘Papa Smurf’ reaching his landmark birthday, and he had seemed in good health at the annual Autosport Awards gala dinner in December.

But in a statement Jenson Button’s agent said: ‘It is with great sadness and regret that I can confirm John Button passed away at his home in the South of France on Sunday.

‘Whilst we await confirmation, 
initial signs would indicate a suspected heart attack. A close friend 
who was visiting John on Sunday was the first to discover the tragic 
news.

‘John's children 
Jenson, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya and the rest of the family are 
clearly devastated and ask for their privacy to be respected during this
 extremely difficult time.’

Ecclestone,
 Formula One’s supremo, spoke for the paddock family after the news 
broke on Monday afternoon, saying: ‘As with most people, I suspect, I 
was surprised to see that we lost John Button. He is someone that I have
 known for over 40 years and is one of those people that you always 
expect to see at a Formula One race. I will certainly miss him.’

John Button was a near ever-present attendee at F1 races, wearing 
headphones to follow the radio exchanges during practice, qualifying and
 grands prix. He was addicted to motorsport, and was himself runner-up 
in the RAC British Rallycross Championship in 1976.

He
 wanted more for his son. So much so that he was occasionally left with 
empty pockets. While traipsing back from Scotland with Jenson's kart 
tied on the back of his old Transit van, John had to borrow money for 
the petrol to get them home to Frome, Somerset.

The
 ultimate reward came for John, who was wearing a pink shirt as he did 
superstitiously every Sunday for a race, when Jenson won the world title
 in Brazil five years ago.

Their
 mission was complete and that night John danced away in his son's 
private celebration party at a Sao Paulo nightclub. It is a comfort to 
think that he probably considered everything that came after that as a 
bonus.

Some fathers can be pushy but John learned to place himself 
unobtrusively in the background. He was always there with Jenson but not in the way. Jenson
 was appreciative of the hardships his father had endured as he rose 
through the karting ranks, and, when he was rich enough to provide for 
him, made sure his old man lived and travelled in comfort.

John's
 place on the Riviera was close to Jenson's own. Where he once drove a 
petrol-deficient Transit, John relished the Ferrari he always took to 
the Italian Grand Prix, its great engine shaking the Hotel della Regione
 in Monza when he struck it up.

He
 often had a glass of something red – or, alternatively, something white
 – in his hand. His ready smile and leathery face conveyed conviviality 
to all.

He loved journeying around the world and was particularly 
excited to see Formula One return to America in 2012. He
 got to the States especially early to reconnoitre the best restaurants 
and bars in Austin, and delightedly passed on the tips to the rest of 
us.

The affection in 
which he was held was summed up by Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team 
principal, who said: 'I want to say how very sad I was to hear the news 
of John's passing.

'In
 my long Formula One career, I've encountered many drivers' fathers, but
 I think it's safe to say that John was perhaps more devoted to his son 
than any of them. Ever since Jenson was a boy, racing go-karts, his dad 
has been at his side, helping him, supporting him, finding the money for
 the next race.

'As Jenson grew older, and continued to win in cars, still John was always there, his most steadfast helper and supporter.

'And,
 even now, in recent years, during which Jenson has become the 
consummate Formula One world champion that he is, the most experienced 
driver on the grid in fact, still John has been ever-present, as loyal 
and as loving as ever, a benign and popular member of Jenson's small and
 intimate entourage.

'This
 coming season will be Jenson's fifth as a McLaren driver. I believe 
John has attended every grand prix over the past four seasons, and over 
that period he's become a unique and, I think it's fair to say, 
irreplaceable part of the McLaren "family".

'He
 was a great dad, but also a lovely man, and he'll be enormously missed 
by Jenson, of course, by all at McLaren, and indeed by the Formula One 
community at large.'

Typically,
 John was looking forward to the coming season. The last time I saw him –
 at the Autosport Awards – he upbraided me for criticising McLaren's 
failings next season. Loyal to Whitmarsh and hoping for the best for his
 son, he said: 'Don't you worry, next season we'll be fine.'

Everyone in the paddock, starting with poor Jenson, of course, is simply sorry he won't be around to see it unfold.
