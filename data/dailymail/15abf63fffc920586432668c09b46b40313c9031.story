Fraudster: Johnstone ordered pizza and paid for it using somebody else's credit card on four occasions

A morbidly obese man who gorged his way through £120-worth of stolen pizza failed to attend court because he was 'too fat' to leave his house.

Liam Johstone, 21, pleaded guilty through his lawyer to ordering takeaway from fast-food chain Domino's Pizza on four separate occasions, which cost £30 a time and was paid for using somebody else's credit card.

The cheesy feasts were delivered to his home in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland.

At a hearing at Livingston Sheriff Court, Johnstone's lawyer, Alan Jackson, claimed his client had been unable to attend in person because he had 'extreme difficulty getting out of the house'.

He added: 'The last information I have is that he can’t physically get out of the house even with assistance.

'I’ve tried to contact him but his phone is switched off so I’m quite happy to undertake to make a home visit.'

Mr Jackson admitted that a warrant had been granted on June 20 for police to arrest 21-year-old Johnstone, who weighs 40-stone.

The accused failed to appear at two earlier hearings after being ordered to pay compensation to Domino’s Pizza in Bathgate, West Lothian.

It was claimed at the time that he was 'too fat' to come to court.

Johnston earlier pleaded guilty to obtaining almost £120 worth of goods by fraud by pretending to Zaffer Ahmed, who worked at the fast food outlet, that he was the holder of the card he used to pay for the meals.

Because Johnstone has not yet appeared at court, it has not yet been made clear who exactly the card belonged to.

He was caught after scoffing four takeaway feasts costing around £30 each which he had delivered to his home.

Mr Jackson said Johnstone had a 'reasonable income' from benefit payments and could afford to make restitution.

But he added: 'He’s not been in touch. I know he’s still engaging with certain social services.'

Sheriff John Rafferty criticised Johnstone for not contacting Mr Jackson.

He said: 'It seems to me he’s not beyond communicating with if he wants to get in touch with you.

'A soul and conscience certificate should have been available for today because this has not come as any great surprise to him.

'It’s only because I can see huge practical difficulties with him being apprehended by the police that I’ll not grant a warrant in this case.'

Sentencing was deferred for a further two weeks.
