He may be just 3ft 1ins tall but height has never been a barrier for this 16-year-old who has become a top performer at the extreme sport of free-running.

Kain Francis - who has a rare form of dwarfism - risks life and limb, scaling high buildings, leaping off objects and standing on his head, to indulge his passion for the craze.

And at 96 centimetres, or 3ft 1ins, the teenager has learned to cope with the rough and tumble, having spent years battling against bullies who targeted him over his condition.

Talented: Sports mad Kain Francis, 16, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, has been picked for the basketball and football in the Dwarf Games in America

Kain’s proud family said he had 
overcome cruel barbs from people who called him Mini-Me, after the 
diminutive character in the Austin Powers movies.

Now the aspiring TV producer is off to the World Dwarf Games in America, competing in football and basketball.

Former
Perry Beeches Academy pupil Kain, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, said 
he had learned to overcome the attention his height attracted.

Rough and tumble: The teenager risks life and limb, scaling high buildings, leaping off objects and standing on his head, to indulge his passion for free-running

'It got to me when I started secondary school,' he said.

'I didn’t realise it would be as bad as it was. The kids would pick me up without asking me and joke about me getting into my bag.

'They’d call me Mini-Me and midget.

'In the end, it was sorted out when I flagged it up to the teacher.

'Now if someone asks what is wrong with me, I just tell them. I even went to a college to talk about my condition and everyone understood it a lot more.

'I haven’t really seen anyone else in the city with my type of dwarfism.'

Head over heels: 3ft 1ins tall Kain Francis took up the extreme sport of free-running in order to keep fit

Ambition: Kain Francis has never let his height prevent him from fulfilling his love of playing sport and keeping active

Kain now works part-time as a junior administrator at Acer Equipment, in Solihull, West Midlands, and is to start at Walsall College in September.

He said his love of free running stemmed from a desire to keep fit.

'A friend started doing it and I wasn’t very fit so I thought I’d do it to improve myself.

'It is really difficult and it involves climbing really tall objects.

'The tallest is probably around 20ft high.'

Kain’s condition was diagnosed after he was born nine weeks early at Birmingham’s City Hospital.

His
5ft 2ins mum, administrator Luan, 42, said: 'Around two days later, a 
doctor noticed there was something wrong with his bone structures.

'He said it seemed to a be a genetic mutation and asked if there was dwarfism in the family.'

His parents were told he had skeletal dysplasia and more tests were carried out to find out what type of dwarfism he had.

But doctors were baffled as he had the chromosome normally missing in those with the condition.

Diagnosis: Kain Francis, pictured aged three, with his one-year-old sister, was diagnosed with a rare form of dwarfism shortly after he was born

Luan added: 'At the time it was devastating. This wasn’t picked up during the 20-week scan when I was pregnant.

'We did our own research to find out about how it would affect him.

'There were lots of support groups for people with dwarfism, including the Restricted Growth Foundation.

'But we are quite independent. Eron and I wanted to give him the best upbringing possible and didn’t want him to feel any different.'

But the differences in Kain became more noticeable as he got older, especially why he stands next to dad Eron, 47, who is a strapping six-footer.

'He started walking at about 13 months like others, but he looked like a baby chicken,' Luan said.

'His gait was different, too. But cognitively he was fine and was a typical baby in many other ways.

'He is stared at every day. People point and stare. I can take it from children, but I find it difficult from adults.

'Sometimes people will stop their car just to look at him. People think he’s just like Verne Troyer.'

Luan
said of one incident: 'About ten years ago, a man on his scooter saw 
Kain and put his little finger to his mouth as the character does in the
movies.

'I said to him: "How dare you? You wouldn’t take the mickey out of someone with a different disability like that".

'I still feel that way. No other disabled person would be treated that way, but people think they can poke fun at those with dwarfism.

'I have even come across people who are scared of those with the condition. The word midget is highly offensive too and has no place in today’s society.'

Kain, who was a 13-year-old sister called Ella, faces at least two years of surgery to straighten his legs after he returns from the week-long games, to be held in Michigan, USA, from Saturday.

Surgery: Kain Francis will undergo operations on his legs when he returns from representing his country at basketball and football in the Dwarf Games in Michigan

'I can’t wait to go to the games as I’ve never been before,' he said.

'I won’t be able to compete in the National Dwarf Games at the Alexander Stadium, Birmingham, next year as I’m having an operation on my legs so I’ll be recovering for quite a while.'

Kain was first introduced to the national games aged four and won a young achievers’ award the following year.

He took part until he was six, when he first underwent leg surgery, and returned at nine.

Over the years, he picked up medals in football, javelin, the discus and the relay race.

'He is amazing at football,' Luan said. 'He has very good eye-hand co-ordination.

'I really encouraged him to go for the world games, and we had to raise £1,700. Hopefully he’ll do really well.

'He is very independent and doesn’t dwell on being a dwarf. He is just a boy who is slightly different.'

More information about the games and the Dwarf Athletics Association is available at www.dsauk.org. Kain’s trip to Michigan is being subsidised by the Dream it, Believe it Achieve it Foundation.
