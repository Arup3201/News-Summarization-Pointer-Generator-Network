Sportsmail's columnists Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp tackle the key questions ahead of England's World Cup opener against Italy.

Jamie Redknapp: I hope the players have watched the DVD of the match against Italy in the European Championship in 2012. England’s retention of the ball was appalling. It’s OK having quick players but we must keep the ball and we don’t do it well in our country. This is a game to change that.

Martin Keown: It’s easy to stereotype the Italian team as one full of great defenders but I don’t think this lot are up to it. We need to ask them serious questions from the off. Wayne Rooney must get in the pocket to pester Andrea Pirlo and it is becoming increasingly hard to leave out Raheem Sterling.

Answer all our prayers: Captain Steven Gerrard will be vital if England are to start with a win

Keown: Steven Gerrard. To play good football you need your best player in the middle and he’s ours. His passing range, defensive responsibility and leadership are invaluable.

Redknapp: I am pretty comfortable with the strikers and the midfield options, but our defence worries me. So I am going for Gary Cahill. He needs to play the way that he plays for Chelsea.

Redknapp: Mario Balotelli. Everyone says Pirlo but he won’t surprise us. We know what he can do (and he does it brilliantly). Balotelli will look at this England central defensive pairing and think: ‘there is joy in this for me’. He is their box-office player, if he turns up in the right frame of mind. If.

Keown: Balotelli. If he’s focused and switched on, we’ve got a problem. He will fancy his chances against us but the centre backs have to match his aggression and make sure they are first to every ball. He is a different animal playing for Italy but he’s mentally unreliable and can be wound up.

Key man: Gary Cahill (centre) will be vital if England are to keep Italy out

Keown: England’s philosophy: Play without fear.  

Redknapp: Possession, pace, penetration. The three Ps.

Redknapp: The food. If you’re in the area, get down to Luigi’s in London’s Kings Road for a takeaway for the match.

Keown: The Amalfi Coast. A sensational drive, despite my taxi driver’s suicidal driving.

Keown: Watching Pirlo humiliate us in 2012 with his passing before capping it with that chipped penalty.

Redknapp: England playing them in the Euros and lumping the ball from Joe Hart to Andy Carroll.

Humiliation: Andrea Pirlo's Panenka penalty emphasised Italy's dominance of the ball in the Euro 2012 clash

Redknapp: At home, with my family, writing notes for my Sportsmail column. I hope I can write ‘Gerrard is England’s Pirlo’ on Monday morning.

Keown: After a long day of travelling, most likely in a hotel bar in Porto Alegre with my BBC commentary team.

Redknapp: ‘Keep the ball.’

Keown: ‘Don’t forget to enjoy it.’

Favourites: Martin Keown admired Franco Baresi (left), while Jamie Redknapp liked Giuseppe Giannini (right)

Keown: They have had such an outstanding collection of defenders but Franco Baresi was a one-off. His ability on the ball and the way he  marshalled that defence was an inspiration.

Redknapp: Giuseppe Giannini, who played 47 times for Italy and 318 times for Roma. I wanted to be him when I was a kid. The Italian press called him ‘The Prince’.

Redknapp: 1-1. Cagey and tight and Ross Barkley making a difference, even if he has to wait to come on from the bench. I hope Roy Hodgson will trust him and give him the opportunity. He can be England’s game changer.

Keown: 1-1. Italy will score first but we can finish the game strongly. Hopefully our youngsters coming off the bench can give Roy plenty of selection dilemmas for the Uruguay game.
