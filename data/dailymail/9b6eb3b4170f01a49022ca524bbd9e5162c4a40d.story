Sydney and Melbourne have been named in the Top 10 safest cities in the world.

The Economist’s Intelligence Unit has released a ranking of the safest major cities in the world, with Sydney finishing in sixth place and Melbourne in ninth.

Japan’s capital city Tokyo topped the list followed by Singapore and Osaka in Japan. Business Insider Australia reported that the Economist’s Safe Index 2015 doesn’t simply measure crime, but rather has a wide-ranging view of safety.

Sydney ranked in the top 10 for infrastructure. Hardly surprising when you've got the Sydney Opera House  

The Economist’s ranking looked at 50 cities and chose them based on regional representation and availability of data. The cities were ranked on digital security, health security, infrastructure, and personal safety.

With 4.5 million people, Sydney ranked in the top 10 for infrastructure, security and personal safety. However, it lagged behind in digital security and health security, in which it ranks 14th and 17th, respectively.

However, Australia has some of the highest incidences of cybercrime in the world with Australians in the likes of Sydney now prime targets for internet fraud and identity thieves.

Melbourne, with a population of 4 million has the second-safest infrastructure of the 50 cities ranked and ranks eighth in the category of personal safety.

It also has one of the highest life expectancies of any city in the world at 86 years. As the report notes: ‘Living in a safe and healthy urban environment can make a real and measurable difference to city inhabitants.’

The report also found that it is the sixth-best city in the world to live in, when factors like safety and cost of living are taken into account.

New York and Los Angeles lead in digital security, while Zurich takes the top spot for both health security and infrastructure safety.

Each security section studied had its own requirements. Digital security measured the quality of a city’s cybersecurity, the frequency of identity theft, and other factors related to digital security.

Places like Federation Square made Melbourne the second-safest infrastructure of the 50 cities ranked

Health security was a metric look at average life expectancy of a city’s citizens as well as the ratio of hospital beds to the size of the population.

The Infrastructure section looked at factors like the quality of roads and the number of people who die from natural disasters.

While personal safety was a category looking at more traditional safety measures like crime, the level of police engagement, and the number of violent crimes.

The beauty of the likes of Southgate Complex on the Yarra River in Melbourne can make a 'real and measurable difference to city inhabitants', the report stated
