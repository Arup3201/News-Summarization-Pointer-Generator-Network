A Catholic nun is alleged to have sent six envelopes containing white powder to parliamentary figures including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a court heard today.

The defendant, who is known as Sister Ruth Augustus, is accused of scrawling 'devil worshipping' on envelopes filled with white powder that she posted to Nick Clegg and Baroness Scotland, Harrow Crown Court was told.

The letters were intercepted, three at a time on two separate occasions, at a mail screening centre and the powder was found to be non hazardous, the court heard.

Baroness of Scotland and Nick Clegg were both sent envelopes with a white substance inside

The defendant, 71, of Leyton, east London, denies six counts of hoaxes involving noxious substances or things.

Mark Kimsey, prosecuting, said Augustus accepts that she sent envelopes with letters in them but says police put the white powder in them.

Mr Kimsey said three envelopes were intercepted at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17, 2011.

A worker was checking mail at 5.30am when three envelopes raised concerns.

One was addressed to Mr Clegg and on 
the envelope was written 'devil worshipping', 'freemason', 'sex with 
thirty plus women' and 'your poor Catholic wife and children'.

The second was to Baroness Scotland, and had a swastika on it, and two crosses, and 'stop this evil devil worshipping'.

The third was to Baroness Kennedy, and was endorsed with a swastika, and 'stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons'.

Sister Ruth Augustus is accused of sending envelopes to Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP

The envelopes contained a gritty 
substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for 
anthrax, and specialist police who were called in found them to be non 
hazardous.

On October 1, at the same mail centre, three more envelopes were found, addressed to Mr Clegg, Baroness Kennedy and Edward Leigh MP.

The envelopes carried similar endorsements and slogans and contained white powder which was found to be non hazardous.

Mr Kimsey told the jury: 'The issue is 
whether she herself put the white powder within the envelopes, and, if 
so, was it with the intention to induce the recipient to fear they were 
hazardous.

'Albeit this is a hoax, it's a serious
matter, when what was sent was white powder, with the intention to make
the person believe they were receiving a noxious substance.'

On December 7, Augustus was arrested at a hotel in north west London where she was staying and told police 'It's a load of lies', Mr Kimsey said.

The court heard that Augustus told police during interview: 'I'm Sister Ruth, a 71-year-old disabled nun.'

She also said: 'I look like a terrorist, don't I, working for a charity all over the world, with orphans?'

The jury heard that she told interviewing officer Detective Constable Anne Adams: 'The police are run by freemasons. All the top women are in it.'

Harrow Crown Court heard that the nun had told police she had more brains than they did

Asked why she had sent a letter to Mr Leigh, she said: 'He's a Catholic, and goes to Westminster Cathedral.'

As for Mr Clegg, she said he 'lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government'.

She added: 'He boasted about all the women he's had sex with. He's an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.'

At one point she said: 'I'm not a Muslim terrorist, I'm a Catholic nun.'

And she said of the police: 'They opened the envelopes, and put white powder in, to frame me. I know they monitor it all.

'I'm a Catholic nun, with more brains and intelligence than the police.'

Asked if she was sending the letters for 'attention', she said: 'Of course I am. I'm deliberately writing on the envelope as well so all the postmen will know all about it.'

The trial was adjourned until 10.30am tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
