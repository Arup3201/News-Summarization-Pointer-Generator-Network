A juvenile humpback whale was seen frolicking just kilometres from the Sydney Harbour entrance, to the awe of lucky onlookers on Thursday.

About 70 whale watchers mostly on board boats were lucky enough to see the animal breaching in spectacular style as it launched itself out of the ocean before crashing on its back and sending water flying.

A nearby boat was almost within touching distance of the animal as it put on a cresting display.

Throughout the afternoon, the young whale set its course straight for Sydney Harbour, before heading to the Manly Wharf area.

Jonas Liebschner from Whale Watching Sydney it was not unusual to the inquisitive creatures to investigate the area.

'Whales do sometimes come into Sydney Harbour and have a little bit of a look around,' he said.

Thursday's whale sighting is the third in the Sydney area in less than a week.

On Saturday, up to 10 humpback whales were spotted off Bondi Beach and near Botany Bay, marking the start of the harbour city's whale-watching season.

Two humpbacks were seen playing with a pod of dolphins off Bondi Beach on Saturday morning, followed by another five seen around the same area later that afternoon.

More than 20,000 humpbacks are expected to pass Sydney as they head north to warmer waters off the Queensland coast

Another four were spotted near Botany Bay, in Sydney's south east.

Mr Liebschner previously said the large number of animals sighted was extraordinary, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'(It) is a phenomenal number for this early in the season,' he said.

More of the creatures are expected to pass the city throughout the season and Mr Liebschner said whale numbers had steadily increased by about 10 per cent in the last five to six years.

As part of their migration, about 20,000 whales will travel north past Sydney as they make their way to sub-tropical breeding grounds off the Queensland coast.

On their way back, this number is expect to be about 22,000 whales, with the addition of 2,000 newborn calves, Mr Liebschner said.

The sightings have coincided with the above average warm weather.

For those hoping to catch a glimpse of a humpback or many of the other species of whale, the mammals will complete the 5,000km trip along Australia's east coast from Antarctic waters - one of the longest in the animal kingdom - in the coming months.
