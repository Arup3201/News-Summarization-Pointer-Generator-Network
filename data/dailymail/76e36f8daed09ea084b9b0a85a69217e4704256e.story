The two families in Alaska who died in a fiery plane crash Sunday were on vacation and just hoping to spot a bear.

But the the Antonakos and McManus families, both of South Carolina, won’t be returning home to share their tales.

Nine parents and children died after a failed take-off 75 miles outside Anchorage, plus the pilot, after the families decided to do something new and exciting this summer.

'An absolutely fabulous family': Melet Antonakos (left) died tragically with his wife Kim (right) and three children along with a fellow South Carolina family Sunday when their plane went down in the Alaska outback

‘They
were very excited,’ the father of Kimberly Antonakos, H. Wayne Clayton,
said Monday. ‘They never had been there before and wanted to see what 
it was like.’

Kimberly
Antonakos, her husband Melet Antonakos and their three children were 
among those killed the crash that left all 10 on board dead.

Tragic end: The Antonakos family usually went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in the summer, but decided to do something adventurous this year. At left is Mills, 14, and 16-year-old Olivia is at right. Their 11-year-old sister Anastacia also perished

The Antonakos family of 
Greenville, South Carolina, usually went to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
each summer, but Clayton said Monday his daughter and her family 
decided to travel to Alaska for 10 days this year instead.

Clayton said his son-in-law 
sold computer software to hospitals and doctors' offices, while Kimberly
shuffled the three children to their many activities. The children were
16-year-old Olivia, 14-year-old Mills and 11-year-old Anastacia.

‘It's rough, to lose five (family) members at one time,’ Clayton said.

'They were beautiful': The McManus family, (pictured are Stacey, top, Connor, left, Dr. Chris McManus, right, and Meghan) died alongside the Antonakos family according to their church pastor

Investigators
have begun their probe of the de Havilland DHC3 Otter that crashed and 
burned Sunday at the airport in Soldotna, about 75 miles southwest of 
Anchorage on the Kenai Peninsula. The plane had just taken off and 
apparently was en route to a fishing lodge, according to National 
Transportation Safety Board investigator Clint Johnson.

South
Carolina House Majority Leader Bruce Bannister said four of the other 
victims were also a family from Greenville, South Carolina - Chris 
McManus and Stacey McManus and their two children.

A neighbor said the McManus Family made him feel immediately welcome when he moved to their Greenville neighborhood.

'They were very easy going,' Marshall Johnson told the Charlotte Observer. 'They were beautiful.'

With the help of his radiologist father, Connor McManus was working towards becoming an Eagle Scout, Johnson said.

Happy times: The Antonakos family (their youngest, Anastacia, 11, is at bottom right) decided do something adventurous for vacation this year and booked a 10 day trip to Alaska that ended in tragedy when their plane crashed on takeoff Sunday

Meghan McManus would have started her senior year in high school in the fall and had already begun looking at colleges.

Stacey
McManus on the board member their Episcopal church's women's group and 
taught Sunday school, said Reverend Harrison McLeod, rector at Christ 
Church Episcopal. She also helped run the auction at the school's annual
gala this spring.

McLeod said he wasn't at all surprised the family took such an adventurous trip.

'This
vacation was indicative of who they were,' McLeod old the Observer. 
'They enjoyed each other's company. They were a wonderful example of how
a family can play together and get the most from each other.'

Just starting out: Meghan McManus, the oldest child killed in Sunday's tragedy, was about to start her senior year in high school and was already looking at colleges with her mom and dad, Dr. Chris McManus, a radiologist

Bannister
said the Antonakos family lived on his street in Greenville. Olivia was
going to be in 11th grade, Mills was going to be in ninth grade and 
Anna was going to be in sixth grade next year, he said.

‘They were great kids - just a fantastic family,’ Bannister said.

‘Anna
is in my son's class and got basically every award you can get at the 
fifth-grade awards day,’ Bannister told the Charlotte Observer. ‘They 
were just an absolutely fabulous family.’

The victims also included the plane's pilot.

'I
just can't believe it,' Bannister said of the Antonakos family. 'They 
were on the plane, on a family vacation, and they are not coming back.'

Tragic end: The de Havilland DHC3 Otter was engulfed in flames Sunday July 7 at the Soldotna Airport in Soldotna, Alaska. Two families perished along with the pilot

Pilot: Walter "Willie" Rediske, right, was also killed in the crash Sunday at the airport in Soldotna

The
Federal Aviation Administration said the Otter was operated by Rediske 
Air, based in Nikiski, another Kenai Peninsula community. The pilot of 
the downed plane was Nikiski-based Walter ‘Willie’

Rediske, company 
spokesman Andy Harcombe said.The
remains of the victims were sent to the State Medical Examiner's Office
in Anchorage for autopsies and positive identifications.

The
majority of Alaska communities aren't connected to the road system, 
with small planes providing a vital link to the outside world. They 
bring in food, medicine, mail and other supplies, and provide for air 
travel - with scheduled and on-demand flights. Air taxis, which provide 
nonscheduled commercial flights, provide access to wilderness areas and 
link small, remote villages, according to a National Transportation 
Safety Board report.

During 
the summer tourist season, helicopters and seaplanes - small aircraft 
outfitted with floats that take off from and land on water - are 
commonly seen in places like Juneau, Alaska's capital city, taking 
visitors to see glaciers, bears or other attractions.

Far from home: The tragedy occurred 75 miles outside Anchorage Alaska as the families were en route to a bear viewing lodge at Lake Clark Sunday

Under investigation: Nikiski, Alaska-based Walter 'Willie' Rediske was the pilot, who also died in the crash. The company was involved in an accident last year. The federal investigation into the crash is expected to take 5 to 8 days

‘Aviation is a basic mode of 
transportation and the small general aviation aircraft is the equivalent
of the minivan for a family in Bush Alaska,’ C. Joy Journeay, executive
director of the Alaska Air Carriers Association, said in an email.

‘Over
10,000 piston engine aircraft are registered in the State of Alaska and
provide the primary means of transportation,’ she said. ‘They are the 
backbone of transportation for the state.’

The NTSB sent an investigative team 
from Washington, D.C., that arrived in Anchorage on Monday afternoon 
before heading to Soldotna. NTSB member Earl Weener said the on-scene 
investigation is expected to last between five and eight days, with a 
probable cause determination expected in about a year.

At the time of the crash, there were light winds and high clouds, Johnson said.

Rediske Air was involved in an accident last year in Nikiski, according to an NTSB database report.

In
the non-injury mishap, the pilot of a Cessna 207A plane misidentified 
the runway surface at night and landed the aircraft in a snow bank. The 
pilot said most of the runway lights had been covered by heavy snow and 
were not clearly visible.

Explosive: The flames of the crash took ten minutes to extinguish and kept firefighters from responding right away

The plane's wings and horizontal stabilizer sustained substantial damage.

In the Soldotna crash, the flames took 10 minutes to extinguish and initially kept firefighters from reaching the wreckage, according to authorities.

The de Havilland is similar to an Otter that crashed in Alaska in 2010, killing former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and four others, Johnson said. The plane in the Stevens crash was equipped with floats, while the plane in Sunday's crash had wheels.

It's possible to drive from Anchorage to Soldotna, but it's about a four-hour trip as the highway hugs Turnagain Arm, then cuts through a mountain pass.

Soldotna, with a population of about 4,300, is on the banks of the Kenai River, and the area is busy this time of the year with people fishing for salmon. The airport is located about a mile from a commercial area and has a paved runway that is 5,000 feet long.

What happened? NTSB representative Earl Weener speaks to the media in Anchorage, Alaska on Monday about the crash in Soldotna. Authorities say the investigation will take another five to eight days
