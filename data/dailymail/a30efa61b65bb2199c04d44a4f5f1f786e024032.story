His Argentina side may have lost to Portugal due to a last-minute winner from Raphael Gurreiro, but Tottenham's Eirk Lamela appeared in good spirits on his journey back from Manchester.

Lamela, a second-half substitute in the 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford, uploaded a picture via Instagram with the caption 'coming back to London'.

He was also enjoying some mate tea, a herbal drink which is extremely popular from South America.

Lamela has been part of a Tottenham side that has struggled so far under new manager Mauricio Pochettino in the Premier League this season, and is 12th after 10 games.

Argentine Pochettino will need his compatriot to recover in time for Tottenham's trip to Hull on Sunday, as they look to revive their season.

But while Tottenham's campaign has been one to forget so far, Lamela produced a moment to remember with a superb rabona goal in the Europa League against Astera Tripoli in October.
