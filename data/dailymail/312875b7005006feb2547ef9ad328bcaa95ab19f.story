A married police officer has been arrested after allegedly having sex with three prostitutes while on duty.

PC Darren Bromley has quit Greater Manchester Police after being held on suspicion of misconduct in public office after being accused of sleeping with sex workers he first met on patrol.

Mr Bromley, 38, is said to have got to know a number of prostitutes while working in the red light district in Manchester city centre and allegedly slept with them on separate occasions.

His force became involved when he was reportedly seen at a sex worker's home and is now being investigated by Greater Manchester Police's standards unit and has been arrested.

Since then he had been on restricted duties due to the allegations but quit two weeks ago. He has been bailed until February.

Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley said: 'Prostitutes are vulnerable people and we will go to any lengths it takes to unearth any individuals guilty of this sort of thing and get them out of this organisation.

'Where possible we will push hard for a conviction against any police officer we find to be engaged in this type of activity.'

A police spokesman said: 'GMP's Professional Standards Branch are investigating three separate allegations that a police officer had a sexual relationship with three women whilst on duty. The offences took place on different occasions.

'A 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. He remains on police bail until February 4, 2015.

'He was placed on restricted duties but has subsequently resigned.'

The case was passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission twice at the start of the year, it is understood.

A spokesman confirmed it had looked into the matter and passed it back to GMP to investigate under its supervision.

Mr Bromley is the second officer in his division to be suspended amid allegations of inappropriate sexual activity.

In August, Pc Kevin Dwyer, 39, was charged with two counts of voyeurism and ten counts of outraging public decency.
