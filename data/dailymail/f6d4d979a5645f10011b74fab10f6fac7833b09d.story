A British expat was killed by a suspected terrorist car bomb in Yemen yesterday.

David Mockett, from Plymouth, Devon, was killed instantly when a bomb planted under the driver’s seat of his sports utility vehicle blew up as he drove through the southern port city of Aden.

Mr Mockett, who was aged in his 60s, worked as surveyor for Arabian Marine Surveyors Ltd.

Last night his wife, Cynthia, revealed 
her fears the blast was so powerful she will not have a body to bury. 
She said: ‘My husband went up in flames. I just wish I had something to 
bury - but I don’t think I will.’

He 
had recently returned from the city of Hodeida on Yemen’s west coast and
his car exploded after he left the hotel where he was staying.

'We tend to think that it was some kind of terrorist attack because he was well known,' a security source said.

Officials blame a rise in violence in
southern Yemen on Al Qaeda-linked militants they say are taking 
advantage of the country’s political turmoil.

In April 2010 the British ambassador to Yemen narrowly escaped being killed when a car bomb hit his convoy in Sana’a.

And last October a rocket-propelled grenade hit an embassy car in Sana’a, wounding three people, including a diplomat.

Aden has been relatively quiet in 
recent months, even as mass protests demanding the removal of President 
Ali Abdullah Saleh drag into their sixth month, erupting into sporadic 
bursts of violence.  

The neighbouring Abyan province has 
been plunged into daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the 
city of Jaar in March and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in May.    

The army, which says the militants 
are part of al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing, launched an offensive to retake
Zinjibar five days ago but has yet to regain the city.    

A security belt was placed around 
Aden in the hope of preventing more militants from 
slipping in. Some 54,000 Abyan residents 
have sought refuge in Aden.    

The United States and neighbouring 
oil giant Saudi Arabia have grown increasingly worried about the turmoil
in the Arabian Peninsula state - the Arab world's poorest country.

However, attacks on foreigners are 
rare in Aden, which lies east of a strategic shipping lane that channels
some three million barrels of oil daily.    

The explosion of the surveyor's car shattered windows in nearby buildings on Aden's Mualla Plaza.    

'He started the car and it immediately exploded and he was engulfed in flames,' a witness said.

One passer-by was critically injured in the blast which also damaged nearby buildings, a municipal official said.

'It's clear that there was some kind of explosive device placed in his car,' she said.   

Riyadh and Washington, both targets 
of foiled al Qaeda attacks from Yemen, fear rising instability provides 
militants with room to operate.    

In a separate incident yesterday, an 
opposition official from the leading Islamist party Islah survived an 
attack by gunmen in the capital of Sana'a.

The northern capital has witnessed 
rising violence in recent days following weeks of relative calm after 
Saleh left the country for treatment on injuries he surviving as 
assassination attempt in his compound.    

Islah leader Mohammed al-Yadumi's car
had been fired on by gunmen on Monday but he fled the attack, Yemen's 
opposition coalition said. The group blamed forces loyal to Saleh.    

'We hold the heads of national 
security, the Republican Guard, Special Forces and central security 
responsible for this criminal incident,' the coalition said in a 
statement.
