New fathers will be made to take a month off work under a ‘use it or lose it’ paternity leave policy adopted by the Liberal Democrats.

Nick Clegg’s party wants the UK to follow Scandinavia, where fathers are made to play a bigger role in childcare.

Under the plans, to be published today, fathers would be made to take a four-week block of paid leave in the first year of a baby’s life, or lose their entitlement altogether.

A Lib Dem policy paper on ‘work/life balance’ says: ‘Government should improve the affordability, quality, convenience and provision of childcare by introducing a use-it-or-lose it “Daddy Month” based on the Swedish model, to encourage uptake of parental leave among fathers.’

New fathers, like Prince William, could soon be made to take a four-week block of paid leave in the first year of a baby¿s life, or lose their entitlement altogether, under new Lib Dem plans

In Sweden, fathers must take two months of paternity leave, paid at 80 per cent of their usual salary.

At present in the UK, new fathers can take one or two weeks of paternity leave when their child is born, paid at just £136.78 a week. Prince William has taken his two weeks of leave following the birth of Prince George.

Ministers have already announced that from 2015, both parents will be able to share 18 months of parental leave.

But the Lib Dem plan would double the fixed amount available specifically for men when their children are born to a full month, but insist that they take it all in one go or lose their entitlements altogether.

A party spokesman said: ‘The Liberal Democrats are making life easier and fairer for parents by allowing them to share 18 months of parental leave when they have a baby.

‘We believe men and women have equal rights when it comes to working and raising children. As it stands, a father gets two weeks of parental leave on a “use it or lose it” basis.

This policy paper proposes double that.’ A working group led by Baroness Tyler of Enfield, the vice-president of counselling service Relate, came up with the policy motion as part of a larger work-life balance policy.

The policy paper will be debated at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow next month and is expected to form a key plank of the party’s election manifesto in 2015.

Business groups will react with alarm at the proposals, which many believe are unaffordable. And Laura Perrins of the group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘This sounds like another example of liberal dictatorship. Politicians should leave it for families to decide who cares for their children.

‘The majority of mothers want to stay at home themselves. Mums and dads are not just interchangeable car engines for their kids.

'Mums give very special care, particularly to young children.’

But equality campaigners say the move will stop women of child-bearing age being seen as a ‘liability’ to employers by transferring some of the burden of childcare to men.

Campaigners believe nudging fathers to take more time off is good for families as it makes them become more involved in their children’s lives.
