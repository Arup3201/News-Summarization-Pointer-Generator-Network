Authorities say that 27-year-old Adam Morton was taking care of the boy in August while his 24-year-old partner was at work

A New Hampshire man who put his girlfriend's two-year-old son in a running clothes dryer leaving him seriously burned has pleaded guilty to assault.

Authorities say that 27-year-old Adam Morton was taking care of the boy in August while his 24-year-old partner was at work.

According to court documents, the youngster suffered second-degree burns on his arms and back and burns and blisters on his feet after being put inside the laundry drum.

He was rushed to the emergency room at Eastern Maine Medical Center after his mother returned home around 4pm at found him injured.

She reportedly told police that she had only been dating Morton for a short time after splitting from the father of her four children but did not believe he was a violent man.

Morton claimed he put his girlfriend's toddler in the dryer for just one revolution.

However, investigators determined that the boy was in the dryer for a prolonged period.

Dr Lawrence Ricci, who conducted his own forensic examination of the boy concluded 'there were lesions on the lower back that looked like they could have been healing burns and incidentally, the two circular lesions correspond to bolts on the inside of the dryer.'

Dr Ricci also said that 'the distribution of the burns indicates either that the child was moving fairly dramatically and or the dryer was moving.'

In conclusion, Dr Ricci said that the boy was inside the dryer for a 'fairly prolonged period of time. And the dryer, indeed, may have actually been turning.'

As part of their ongoing investigation, police took the dryer from the mother's Maine home and tested to see how hot the drum got when it was on.

They put the machine on for five minutes at the 'low' setting and the dryer hit 125 degrees. 

However, when it was put on 'normal' for three minutes the temperature hit 180 degrees.

Morton was staying with his girlfriend and her three other children when the incident occurred.

According to court documents, the youngster (pictured here with scarring) suffered second-degree burns on his arms and back and burns and blisters on his feet after being put inside the laundry drum

According to WSCH6, when representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services arrived to interview the other children, the were told by them that Morton 'does mean things' to the boy.

Morton was charged with aggravated assault in September and entered his plea in a Bangor courtroom this Tuesday.

He is scheduled to be sentenced on February 2. 

Prosecutors are recommending a two-year sentence.
