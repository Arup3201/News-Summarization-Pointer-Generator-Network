It looks more like something from a high-tech electronics factory than a hospital - but this £2million 'robot surgeon' is now saving the lives of cancer patients in Britain.

The so-called Da Vinci robot is an extremely precise surgical tool which is being used to perform operations in a hospital in Newcastle.

The four-armed machine is operated by a surgeon in a special booth in the Freeman hospital's operating theatre and allows them to work with greater precision.

The £2million Da Vinci robot allows surgeons to carry out precise operations on patients with lung, throat, bladder and other cancers

The four-armed machine is operated by a specialist in a 'booth', who is given a 3D view of the patient's internal organs

It has so far been used to remove cancerous tissue from patients' lungs, throats, prostates and spleens and has assisted medical teams performing heart bypass operations.

The robot's arms go inside the patient during operations, while a surgeon uses a 3D viewfinder, which magnifies the patient's internal organs.

Naeem Soomro, consultant urologist and associate medical director at the Freeman Hospital, told Newcastle's Evening Chronicle: 'We can now get into areas which were previously inaccessible to the human hand.'

He added: 'It gets into the mouth, the tongue, the rib cage, where previously a surgeon simply could not move to work.'

Paul Renforth, Da Vinci co-ordinator at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, says the machine is allowing surgeons to go 'to places we couldn't get to before'

Unlike human surgeons, the robot doesn't get tired and so can perform up to 400 operations a year

The robot's tools are used for up to 10 operations before they are replaced and the robot can carry out up to 400 procedures every year.

Experts say the machines reduce the risk of complications during and after surgery.

Paul Renforth, Da Vinci co-ordinator at the Freeman, told the Guardian: 'You can rotate the instruments 360 degress, so they are more dextrous than the human hand.'

The robots in Newcastle are among 42 around the UK and it is thought the machines' use could spread in the future.
