Vienna's State Opera Ball is noted in high society for its host's exquisite taste that captivates his guests.

But it wasn't a dazzling gown, a spellbinding symphony, or even a tasty hors d'oeuvre that captivated attendees of the extravaganza last night ... but a full-blown punch up between two tie-and-tailed classical music enthusiasts.

The brawl's most talked about moment came when one of the pugilists managed to swing a punishing hook with his right hand without spilling a drop of champagne from the glass in his left.

His older opponent countered with a right but was unable to prevent the blow from landing squarely on his jaw, leaving a nasty gash on his chin.

The altercation rather took the gloss off what was meant to be Kim Kardashian's night, who was allegedly paid $500,000 by an 83-year-old billionaire to be his date for the evening.

Fortunately, though, the reality TV star was out of the room when the rough and tumble commenced, but she stormed out of the party anyway after an usher reportedly insulted her fiance, Kanye West.

Take that, sir! The altercation's most talked about moment came when one of the brawlers managed to throw a swinging hook with his right hand without spilling a drop of champagne from the glass in his left

Fists and cuffs: His older opponent countered with a right fist but was unable to prevent the blow from landing squarely on his jaw

Are you talking to me, sir? The civilised hum of high-society hobnobbing was shattered when the two men - one in his 60s and the other in his 40s - began shouting at each other and waving their fists

The fight broke out at the Austrian 
capital's State Opera House as the event's well-heeled guests mingled in
 the reception area over canapes and champagne.

The civilised hum of high-society hobnobbing was shattered when the two men - one in his mid-60s and another in his 40s - began shouting at each other and waving their fists.

In an instant the row turned ugly as the younger man swung for his enemy, catching him stoutly on the chin with his ring.

When the fight ended, the older assailant was eager to show off the cut on his face from which blood had poured over his pristine-white dress shirt and tie.

Kim it for the money: The altercation rather took the gloss off what was meant to be Kim Kardashian's night, who Viennese millionaire Richard Lugner (right) allegedly paid $500,000 to attend the extravaganza

Causing a stir: Fortunately, though, the reality TV star, 33, was out of the room when punches started flying, but she stormed out of the party anyway after an usher reportedly insulted her fiance, Kanye West

It is yet unclear who the men were, but by the end of the night they were the talk of the party.

Almost every social group and profession in Austria, from confectioners to firefighters and pharmacists to refugees, holds its own ball, but the Opera Ball is the most elite, with a presidential opening and top-class music and ballet.

'It's an event where the opera can present itself. It's an important platform,' opera director Dominique Meyer told Reuters.

But each year, the fine classical performances of the Vienna Philharmonic and State Ballet are overshadowed in the Austrian media by the paid celebrity guests invited by Viennese billionaire mall developer and regular guest Richard Lugner.

Lugner's past guests have included 
singer Geri Halliwell and actors Larry Hagman and Pamela Anderson. This 
year, reality-TV star Kardashian is his main guest.

Fortunately, Miss Kardashian was nowhere near the fight when it broke out, choosing instead to watch the dancing from a VIP box.

The
 33-year-old did, however, cause a stir of her own when she allegedly 
refused to dance with her sponsor - despite her reported $500,000 
attendance fee.

According to RadarOnline,
the 81-year-old told reporters during a photo 
call at his Lugner City mall that the reality star was not doing what he
wanted.

'Kim is 
annoying me because she's not sticking to the program,' he said.

She later ditched her date and left the party early after she was approached by a white male who was working at the event with a 'black face' and began to mimic her fiance Kanye West.
