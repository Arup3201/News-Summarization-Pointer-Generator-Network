Southampton star Graziano Pelle could be the latest Italian striker to get the nod over the misfiring Mario Balotelli.

Azzurri boss Antonio Conte called the St Mary's hitman into the squad as part of the continued snub of Liverpool's Balotelli.

And Pelle - who has netted four Premier League goals for Ronald Koeman's side so far - is in line to make his international debut against Malta on Monday.

Graziano Pelle could make his Italy debut against Malta on Monday after an excellent start to life at St Mary's

The Southampton hitman has four league goals already, including a spectacular strike against QPR

Conte said: 'Pelle? He is an option, as I never call someone up just as a reward for doing well at club level.

'He is an option, just like (Ciro) Immobile, (Sebastian) Giovinco and (Mattia) Destro.'

Conte insisted there would be changes to the side that beat Azerbaijan 2-1 on Friday, with the trip to Malta  a chance for Italy to top Group H.

Mario Balotelli has endured a frustrating start to his Liverpool career and did not make the Italy squad

Azzurri boss Antonio Conte said Balotelli, like all Italians playing abroad, is being monitored closely 

The former Juventus manager also defended his decision to drop Balotelli at the start of the international break.

He said: 'Mario has started a new path. It's not an easy one and I believe he must be given the necessary time to adapt at Liverpool.

'We are following him just as we monitor all Italians that play abroad.

'I make selections not exclusions, which is something completely different.'
