Coma: Alan Harbidge had liver and kidney failure and his fingers swelled up from the mystery infection

A Tesco worker was left in a coma for a month after suffering a suspected spider bite while handling imported food.

Alan Harbidge, of Llanedeyrn, Cardiff, had liver and kidney failure and his fingers swelled up ‘like sausages’ from the mystery infection.

The 57-year-old  worked at a Tesco distribution centre in Magor, South Wales, where a probe has been launched into his sudden illness.

He is expected to make a full recovery, but his sister, Lynda Conniff, 56, said: ‘He lost a month of his life – we were told to expect the worst.

‘He came home from work complaining of groin pains - his job involves lifting so we thought it was a hernia but it was followed by a rash.

‘The rash got worse until it was bright red and then his fingers swelled up until they looked like fat sausages.’

Tests are being carried out to identify the cause of his illness but Mr Harbidge’s family believe he was bitten by a tropical spider at work.

Supermarket customers have previously been bitten by spiders nesting in imported bananas.

But Tesco said its Magor centre does not handle fresh food.

Six years ago father-of-one Mr Harbidge donated bone marrow to save the life of his sister Ms Conniff, who was suffering from cancer.

The mother of four, who kept a bedside vigil with Mr Harbidge’s partner Vicky, said: ‘He was there for me when I was told I needed a bone marrow donor to survive.

‘His cells have been used five times in my fight against illness so it was my turn to do what I could for him.’

Mr Harbidge lost two stone in weight as he battled the mystery illness but doctors said he will make a full recovery in time.

A Tesco spokesman confirmed the chain is aware of his illness but declined to comment until the results of medical tests are known.
