Three men posed as police officers to force their way into a house and drag a father-to-be from his bed before they stabbed him to death in front of his pregnant fiancee, the Old Bailey heard.

Danny Gough, 24, was dragged to the floor and stabbed so many times by Sam Monteith, Stephen Dougherty and Paul West, 30, it was impossible for him to survive.

The court heard the three men had surveyed Mr Gough's fiancee's house for days and equipped themselves with an axe, machete and possibly a sword for the attack. 

Danny Gough, 24, was hacked to death in front of his pregnant fiancee after being dragged to the floor 

They were the kind of weapons that could be used 'silently but lethally', said Mark Heywood, prosecuting.

The trio were caught after they left a Jiff lemon bottle, containing ammonia, behind which they used to spray in the eyes of Mr Gough so he could not protect himself. 

His pregnant fiancee Kareena Modashia was also sprayed so that she could not identify them.

Mr Heywood said: ‘This case concerns a truly vicious killing, one motivated by vengeance and the need to remain in criminal control.' 

Mr Gough, 24, was stabbed with an axe, machete and possibly a sword until he was dead lying on the floor 

The court heard Mr Gough had been involved in an ongoing feud with Stephen Dougherty, 36.

Mr Gough's friend Leanne Meredith was involved in a fight with Dougherty and Monteith, 33, in a pub.

Mr Gough took revenge by breaking into Monteith’s home in Wallington, Surrey, with two others.

Monteith was attacked with ammonia and knives, leaving a 10cm cut across his face - a scar clearly visible at court today during his trial.

During the attack Mr Gough and the two others took Monteith’s phone, the court heard.

In revenge Dougherty then called Mr Gough to make a series of threats in the weeks leading up to the killing. 

Paul West, 30, is accused of murdering Mr Gough 

Dougherty told Gough he was going to have him raped ‘in front of your ugly mum,’ it is claimed.

The men then carried out surveillance of Miss Modashia's house, watching neighbours and monitoring Mr Gough's condition so they could ensure the attack would occur when people were less alert.

Mr Heywood said: ‘They had the information from someone close by, they dressed for the business and armed themselves with the kind of weapons which could be used silently but lethally, weapons with only one purpose - an axe, a machete and a long-bladed instrument, possibly a sword.’

The court heard the men then put their plan into action in the early hours of December 14 2010.

Mr Heywood told the jury: ‘They went to his door, shouted police as a distraction, as a cover, they forced their way through the door and using information they went up the stairs and into the bedroom that he occupied with his girlfriend Kareena Modashia. 

‘They dragged him from his bed, pulled him to the floor and hacked and stabbed at his body causing so many serious wounds that he had no hope of survival.

‘They left only when one of them said ‘he’s dead.'

Mr Heywood said the trio then left quickly and quietly, disposing of anything that may link them to the killing. 

He added: ‘They left only one thing behind by mistake, it was dropped in the final moments when other members of the house heard and were awoken - it was a Jiff lemon bottle filled with ammonia.

‘It was used to spray into the eyes of the deceased so that, although he was sleeping and naked, he was unable to defend himself.

‘They also sprayed the others, his girlfriend and her mother so that it disabled them from identifying the attackers.' 

Dougherty, of no fixed address but formerly of Mijas, Spain; West, of Eaton Avenue, Slough, Berks, and Monteith, of Brighton Road, Sutton all deny murder. The trial continues.
