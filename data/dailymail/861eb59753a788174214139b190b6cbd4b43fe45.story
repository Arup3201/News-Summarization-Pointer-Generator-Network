Jackie Siegel, billionaire star of the infamous Queen of Versailles documentary, has shared a horrifying photo of her face following a laser skin treatment.

Mrs Siegel, a 48-year-old mother-of-eight based in Orlando, Florida, arranged the procedure as a special treat for herself, to 'celebrate' the end of a long-running lawsuit her husband David Siegel has been embroiled in, but had a severe allergic reaction to the laser.

'Siegel freaked when she saw her face, and went back to the doc, who assured her everything was okay,' reports TMZ. 'She says it took a long, painful week for the swelling to go down, but her face did return to normal.'

Ouch! Jackie Siegel, 48, has shared a selfie showing the severe allergic reaction she suffered from a recent skin laser procedure, after which her doctor assured her that everything would 'be okay'

The photo shows Mrs Siegel's aggressively red face covered in blotches and peeling skin reaching from her décolletage to her forehead, and upon closer inspection, her 79-year-old husband pottering around half-nude in the background.

The former Miss Florida beauty queen also released a selfie of her face after the reaction had calmed down, in which her skin is pink, plump and almost entirely wrinkle free.

It's been a challenging few years for the Siegel family. They achieved widespread fame in 2012 following the critical acclaim of Queen of Versailles; a documentary that followed them as they embarked on building the largest house in America.

Things took a turn, however, when the economy crashed and Mr Siegel, billionaire founder of timeshare company Westgate Resorts, had something of a financial nightmare on his hands. He was then forced to list the 13-bedroom, 11-kitchen, 30-bathroom, 90,000-square-foot mansion for sale; all of which appeared in the documentary.

The Siegel couple, whose eight children range in age from seven to 20, did not end up with the sort of fame they had been hoping for, and subsequently launched a lawsuit against the documentary's filmmakers for 'defamation' over their 'riches-to-rags' portrayal.

Ultimately, the Siegel camp lost, and two years on, their $100million mega mansion is still unfinished and unsold.

Mrs Siegel, perhaps on a mission to throw the family into a more positive light next time around, signed a development deal in March with NBC for a new reality TV show.

'I hope they will just let me be me and let me do my own thing,' she told the Orlando Sentinel earlier this month. 'I think that’s what people that saw the movie really liked, because it was real, whereas reality can be somewhat scripted.'
