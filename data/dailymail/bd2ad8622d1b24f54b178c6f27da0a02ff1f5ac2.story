Nelson Mandela will return home today to the mist-shrouded hills he roamed as a boy.

Here in Transkei, the sun seldom pierces the leaden clouds, but by midday tomorrow when it reaches its zenith, he should have been buried.

In keeping with the traditions of his Xhosa tribe, his funeral ought to be a great family gathering when the entire Mandela clan, numbering more than 70, come together.

The giant marquee for the funeral and burial of 
former South African President Nelson Mandela in Qunu. But many members 
of the Mandela clan have not been invited to attend in favour of 
international VIPs

Mr Mandela, who died aged 95, was described as one of the most iconic world leaders in history

It is what he would have wished. But, sadly, it isn’t going to happen.

For
 though the huge ‘marquee’ constructed in the grounds of Mandela’s 
mansion will accommodate 4,500 VIP guests, among them Prince Charles, 
there is apparently insufficient room for many relatives.

His
 great-nephew Mzwandile Mandela – grandson of the former president’s 
brother Maurice, who died last year – lives just across the road from 
the ‘big house’. Yet even this 13-year-old cannot get a pass.

Guests: Prince Charles and Barack Obama are among the thousands of VIPs who will attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela at the expense of members of the former South African leader's clan

Instead, Mzwandile will have to watch the ceremony on a grainy TV.

‘I’m
 sad because I would have liked so much to be there,’ he told me 
forlornly. ‘But they say there are not enough passes for young ones in 
the family.’

Also excluded are Mandela’s niece, Gloria Mkwedini, 38, the daughter of his last-surviving sister and her family of 16.

They live a few miles from the mansion, in one of the many round-shaped, mud-built hovels.

As it has no electricity, they won’t even see the broadcast but will join the throngs jostling for some sort of view.

Sidelined: Nelson Mandela's niece Nokhaya Mkwedini is among the family members who had not been invited to attend the service

Mzwandile Mandela, 13, a grand nephew of the late Mr Mandela who lives right oppisite Mandela's house in Qunu was not allowed to attend the funeral

‘It makes us feel like outcasts,’ 
Gloria told me tearfully, blaming the eldest of Mandela’s three 
daughters, Makaziwe, 59, who, she says, is deciding who should be 
invited.

‘When my husband asked for 
accreditation, she refused. I think it’s because we are so poor and she 
thinks we might embarrass the family.’ The guest-list has also upset the
 broader community, incensed so few of them will be allowed in.

‘If
 Mandela could wake tomorrow, he would be very upset because he would 
have wanted the families of the people he grew up with to be there,’ 
said local ANC councillor Kwanele Mdikani. ‘After all, this is supposed 
to be his homecoming.’

Snub: Xhosa youths are pictures in Qunu ahead of the funeral of Nelson Mandela

Tradition: Locals in Qunu slaughter six sheep in preparation for a memorial service for  Nelson Mandela in his birth village

Tens of thousands of South Africans queued for hours to see the body of Mandela lying in state

The body of Nelson Mandela lies in state in Pretoria, South Africa, earlier this week

Love: Many of the mourners held banners and placards showing their love for the former leader

Long journey: The funeral cortege of Mandela makes its way along Madiba St towards Union Buildings

Last chance: Mourners line along the street as the funeral cortege carrying the coffin of former South African President Nelson Mandela drives through, on its way to lie in state for the final day at the Union Buildings in Pretoria

Immediately after Mr Mandela’s body arrives at the mansion  this morning, an ox will be slaughtered and other tribal rituals followed.

The Transkei people are clearly determined to play their part.As a woman reminded me, less than 20 years ago this was still a sham republic to which black people were consigned under apartheid.

Now, of course, she can come and go as she pleases. She owes her freedom to one man, whose values were forged in these hills, and tomorrow, however long she must stand by the roadside, she is determined to be there and show her gratitude.

Guess who: A giant statue of Nelson Mandela is prepared before its official unveiling in front of Union Buildings where Mandela is lying in state

A celebration: Others were more cheerful as they celebrated the freedom fighter's life

Dedication: The government said some 50,000 people had gathered by 7.30am, and witnesses said the lines in Pretoria, South Africa's capital, were already several miles long
