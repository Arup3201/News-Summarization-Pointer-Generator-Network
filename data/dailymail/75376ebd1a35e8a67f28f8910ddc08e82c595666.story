English athletes have been briefed on how to react if they are booed at the Commonwealth Games by Scottish fans next week.

Several athletes have approached Team England for guidance amid fears that Scottish nationalists could heckle them when they compete.

The Games, which start on Wednesday, take place less than two months before the referendum on Scottish independence.

There are concerns that anti-English sentiment may be running high among some Scottish sports fans and athletes are aware that some may direct abuse towards the Auld Enemy.

Organisers have insisted that English athletes have nothing to worry about and will be given a warm reception, second only to members of Team Scotland.

But a Games insider said that a ‘small number’ of English athletes had already raised the subject of booing and had been told not to react to it.

Other athletes will be given the same advice if they ask Team England about it, and general guidance may be issued as part of a team briefing before the Games.

A spokesman for Team England said: ‘If it happens I’m sure the athletes will all just carry on. Some sports are more adversarial than others.

‘We were all at Hampden Park for the Glasgow Grand Prix athletics meeting at the weekend and the welcome could not have been better.

‘Going on the evidence of the Hampden Park meeting, the Scottish athletes will get the biggest cheer, followed by the other home nations athletes and then the athletes from other countries.’

Reaction: Team England said those who competed at Hampden Park during the Glasgow Grand Prix on Saturday (pictured) were given a warm welcome and have advised English competitors not to ignore the boos 

Members of Team England will take part in the athletes’ parade at the opening ceremony in Celtic Park next Wednesday.

Those from the delegation who have been in Glasgow this week in preparation have been given a warm welcome by their Scottish hosts and are not expecting any problems.

Activists protested outside 10 Downing Street last night calling for David Cameron to speak out against homophobia ahead of the Games. 

Of the 53 countries in the Commonwealth, 42 criminalise homosexuality and campaigners are demanding that the Government uses the Games to tackle the issue.
