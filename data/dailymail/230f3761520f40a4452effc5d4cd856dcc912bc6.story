Eintracht Frankfurt have signed midfielder Lucas Piazon on a season-long loan from Chelsea.

The Brazilian has found it difficult to break into the first team at Stamford Bridge since his arrival in 2012 and spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem where he scored 11 goals in 29 appearances.

The 20-year-old previously spent time on loan at Malaga, where he made his Champions League debut, and Frankfurt sporting director Bruno Hubner is delighted to have secured his services.

On the move again: Lucas Piazon will spend next season at Eintracht Frankfurt

'We are glad that we were able to reach an agreement after lengthy but very fair negotiations with Chelsea and Piazon will strengthen us in the coming season,' he told the club's official website.

'He has played on the left wing, he can play on the right and be used as an attacking midfielder.'

Versatile Piazon has represented Brazil at Under-15, Under-17 and Under-20 level and was part of the Selecao team that won the Toulon Tournament this summer.
