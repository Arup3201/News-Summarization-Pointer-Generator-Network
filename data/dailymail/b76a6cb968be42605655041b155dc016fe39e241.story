Wedding day: Peter and Vivien Beckwith married at The Queen's Chapel of the Savoy, London

He spent years – not to mention a small fortune – helping his late wife turn the Victorian mansion into a much-loved family home.

But now property tycoon Peter Beckwith is selling the Grade II listed property... because his new wife does not want to live there.

Mr Beckwith has put Prospect House on the market for £16.5million, but it appears that both the 69-year-old and his socialite daughter Tamara are somewhat reluctant to see it sold.

For it is filled with memories of Miss Beckwith’s mother Paula, who died of cancer in December 2011 and who played a major role in renovating, decorating and furnishing the once-derelict mansion.

Miss Beckwith said of the sale that she is ‘not going to think about it yet’.

However Mr Beckwith, who married society hostess Vivien McLean last month, has accepted that his new wife wants them to create a home together.

In an interview with a property supplement he said: ‘I built the house with my late wife, and you’ll see there’s a definite woman’s touch to the whole thing.

'The new Mrs Beckwith obviously wants to create her own space, wherever we end up.’

The interviewer described Mr Beckwith, who is worth an estimated £350million, as appearing ‘miffed’ about the sale and the tycoon admitted: ‘I will be sad to leave. It will be impossible to replace and I shall find it difficult to acclimatise anywhere else.’

Sighing, he concluded: ‘Well, variety is the spice of life.’

It is only five weeks ago that the house, in Wimbledon, south-west London, hosted the reception following his marriage to Miss McLean, 67, in the Queen’s Chapel at the Savoy hotel.

Tamara, 44, and her sister Clare Van Dam, 41, were among the guests.

Prospect House, which dates from 1866, had been empty for 36 years before Mr Beckwith purchased it with his brother John in 1995. He and Paula spent four years restoring the sprawling property, once part of the Atkinson Morley Hospital site.

English Heritage agreed to the extensive refurbishments, carried out largely to suit the late Mrs Beckwith’s tastes.

Original mouldings, cornice work and windows were sympathetically restored.

The character of the building was respected by taking a traditional approach to the interiors. The main hall was given an oak staircase and fitted with a distressed Portland stone floor, while four rooms were renovated to create one huge kitchen.

The master bedroom was given a purpose-made hardwood dressing room with hand-carved doors and pilasters.

The grounds were extensively landscaped with several bronzes of a deceased family dog and a giant mermaid made of flowers – and £36,000 was spent on relocating several badger setts to make way for a massive lawn.

Tamara, then in her 20s, moved in so that she could maintain a relationship with her daughter Anouska, now 27. Anouska, born when Miss Beckwith was 17, was raised by her grandparents.

Miss Beckwith, a former Nineties It Girl turned gallery owner who is married to construction heir Giorgio Veroni, told how she helped her mother decorate Prospect House. ‘Me and mummy did this bedroom together,’ she said.

‘All my bedrooms are purple. She loved to find little treasures. Our family revolved around the parents. We come for Sunday lunch, we come to walk the dogs.’
