Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column, Martin talks about Yohan Cabaye, FA Cup tickets and why Nicola Cortese is not a Saint...

CABAYE'S DIFFERENT GRAVY

On Saturday I was at West Ham where watched a player called Yohan Cabaye.

This man is simply a brilliant football player; finding space, drifting away from defenders and like an NFL quarterback he's always looking for an incisive match-winning pass or shot.

I remember Glenn Hoddle saying it's easy to destroy a painting, and anybody can do that, but to be an artist and create beautiful things takes you to another level.

Proper player: Martin Allen was very impressed with Yohan Cabaye performance against West Ham

Now Cheick Tiote in central midfield for Newcastle does a great job blocking and spoiling. But Cabaye is an artist.

In the first 20 minutes he scored a beauty and then made two exquisite passes to open up the West Ham defence. The passes were perfectly weighted and through the eye of a needle.

Breaking up play: Newcastle's Cheick Tiote did a good job at breaking up play

This man most definitely has the ability to play at the very top of the Premier League and I'm sure Newcastle United, all their players, supporters and staff and, most importantly, Alan Pardew will do everything they can to keep him at the club because with him they will win games.

YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE LEGS

You must have legs in your team if you want to win anything these days.

We hear people say his legs have gone. We hear people say he's got no legs.When I watched Newcastle play on Saturday they were full of athletes who are quick and, most importantly, full of legs.

Speed kills: Yoan Gouffran and Newcastle are able to attack with pace

They have pace, and power, they are fast, they are strong, and they are quick.When teams have players that cannot and do not have pace they struggle to get behind the opposition where it hurts and everything is played in front, with plenty of foreplay but very rare full penetration.

Attacking with pace: Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid are known for their speedy play

I've been out to watch Real Madrid and Barcelona and, similar to Newcastle on Saturday, they can keep possession, they can move the ball around but at the key moments the players have the speed to go through get past and get in behind defences.

Without legs, you cannot win games.

NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL...

Not even Kidderminster getting held to ransom by Sunderland over the distribution of FA Cup tickets.

It brings back good memories to read the story that Kidderminster Harriers have got to pay Premier League Sunderland up front for any extra tickets they want for their FA Cup fourth-round tie at the weekend.

Kidderminster have to be very cautious that they will sell out all the tickets that they buy from Sunderland and even though they just sold their main forward, Joe Lolley, to Huddersfield, for a handy sum they don't want to be caught short.

Cup heroes: The Kidderminster players celebrate after knocking out League One Peterborough in the third round replay

When I was at Brentford a few years ago we drew Southampton for the fifth-round FA Cup tie and they made us pay for 5,000 tickets when it was obvious Brentford could take probably 8,000 or 10,000 for the relatively short trip down the M3 to The Saints.

The club dug in and wouldn't gamble for ticket sales and several thousand Brentford fans missed out on what was a tremendous 2-2 draw, played out at St Mary's.

My two cousins rang a couple of days before the game requesting a couple of tickets but they had all sold out. I knew a Southampton supporter who had two spare and promptly organised my two cousins, who were in their 30s, to get their tickets.

Earning a replay: Sam Sodje heads home an equaliser for Brentford in the 2005 cup tie with Southampton

After being 2-0 down we drew 2-2 and I rang my cousins from the team bus after the game. Both their phones were switched off.

I finally got a call at 9.30pm and they informed me they had been thrown out of the ground and kept in Southampton Police Station for having tickets in the wrong area. Safe to say they had a memorable afternoon

THIS IS THE MAGIC OF THE FA CUP

That reminds me of the real magic of the FA Cup, the real stories that go on.

Five days before that special game at St Mary's I had a letter passed to me in my office at Brentford's training ground that had been sent to the football club. It was a request for one of my players to go to a police station as he had not paid his council tax, had avoided all correspondence and was no longer at the property he was supposed to be living in.

In other words, it was a warrant for his arrest.

Tricky matter: Before the FA Cup tie with Southampton, Allen had to speak to one his players about an unpaid tax bill

I'd been on all the courses, gained my UEFA Pro licence and attended the LMA's business management course at the University of Warwick. But this was obviously a tricky, testing matter.

So I called the player in before training and he said to me: 'I will pay it when we get paid at the end of the month.'

I said I don't think that'll be good enough they want to speak to you now.

But he said to me: 'Don't worry gaffer, they won't find me as I'm living at a mate's house.'

I said to him: 'On Saturday afternoon you'll be playing in front of 27,000 people with probably about 500 police there, so let's hope they don't arrest you in the warm up!'

CORTESE IS NO SAINT

Talking of Southampton, they've been making all the headlines recently.

I most definitely do not agree that the club will now go into meltdown and that the players will leave because the chairman, Nicola Cortese, has quit.

It's important to recognise he has done a good job, guiding the club forward and improving and helping the manager maximise the talented players currently there.

Moving on: Nicola Cortese quit his role as executive chairman of Southampton this week

They have nursed the emerging young talent and done well with player recruitment.

The young players that Southampton have – Luke Shaw, James Ward-Prowse, Calum Chambers – all these lads have been at Southampton a long time.

Their academy has been helped with analysts, sports scientists, top schoolboy and youth coaches brought in, to help develop these players, which has made a significant improvement to their first-team squad.

Cortese has overseen this, put everything in place, made big decisions and set up a crucial department to go into full detail on every player that has been signed. There's no disputing that.

Staying put: Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino said he will not quit the club - for now

However, the players are all under contract and they clearly enjoy playing for Mauricio Pochettino. The players will probably be disappointed but footballers very, very quickly move on.

Just as they would've done had Pochettino quit upon hearing the news that Mr Cortese was leaving.

The bottom line is, it's the players going on the pitch to play. Not the chairman that sits in the boardroom eating prawn sandwiches.

It's the manager who should get the credit just as it is the manager who gets the bullet.

On Tuesday night, I watched the FA Cup game between Charlton and Oxford at the Valley.

It was lovely to see both the managers after the game.

Chris
 Powell has done a wonderful job getting Charlton promoted and with no 
investment managed to keep them hanging on in the Championship, which is
 a fine achievement.

Chris Wilder has done a great job at Oxford, 
getting them promoted to League Two from the Conference. His team put in
 a great performance to draw 2-2.

Doing a good job: Both Oxford boss Chris Wilder and Charlton manager Chris Powell will be pleased

I think both managers were happy
 with that result: one was probably very relieved to come back and the 
other tinged with acute disappointment after being 2-0 up.

The 
public do not know how difficult it is for managers; the stress, 
frustration and build-up of anxiety, and when I met Chris and Chris 
after the game you can see it had been a difficult evening for both of 
them.

It's draining, it's tiring, and when I drove away from the 
Valley, I was full of energy and enthusiasm ready for a return to the 
Mad world of the technical area.
