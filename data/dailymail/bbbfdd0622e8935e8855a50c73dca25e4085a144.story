Perth science teacher Geoffrey Vargas has been terminated after an experiment left two students badly injured with burns and lacerations

A science teacher has been fired after an experiment he conducted in class caused a glass jar to explode leaving two students badly injured with burns and lacerations.

Perth Waldorf School administrator Bruce Uchiyama-Lee said teacher Geoffrey Vargas, 49, had been terminated following the March incident which injured two boys aged between 16 and 17.

Mr Vargas said he made a 'mistake' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was 'very dangerous'.

The experiment carried out during a Class 11 and 12 Chemistry lesson involved pupils lighting oxygen in a glass jar on fire.

The glass has previously contained liquefied natural gas and this created a 'very powerful explosion' which severed the tendons in one student's hand.

'They've been treated and they're coping well but obviously [one student] needs some support in terms of school work because he can't use his hand,' Mr Uchiyama-Lee said.

Mr Uchiyama-Lee said experts independent from the school in Bibra Lake, Perth concluded that the experiment should not have been conducted.

'The experiment wasn't curriculum based, it wasn't from a text book,' he said.

'It shouldn't have been conducted in any shape or form.'

The students were practicing writing lab reports and there were a range of curriculum-based experiments that could have been carried out instead of the oxygen experiment, Mr Uchiyama-Lee said.

'Gases shouldn't be lit in glass jars full stop unless it's a beaker,' he said.

The incident occurred at Perth Waldorf School (pictured) in March during a Class 11 and 12 Chemistry lesson

'The whole experiment was wrong it shouldn't have been done full stop.

'It was believed the LNG had been burned out. That wasn't confirmed so when oxygen was added it combusted.

'If it had been confirmed LNG wasn't in there it wouldn't have been a problem.'[

In a school newsletter issued to parents on May 1 Mr Uchiyama-Lee said the boys' recovery will be long term.

'Their recovery… will involve permanent scars and for one student it may involve further operations to ensure he has full movement of his hand,' he wrote.

'As these two boys are in Class 12 and going through the intensity of that year – Class 12 project deadlines as well as normal class work and exams are looming - being injured in this way has created much stress for them and their families.'

Mr Vargas told MailOnline he made a mistake in conducting the experiment.

'I'm not denying I did a mistake by over-challenging the students, I should have just worked with limited equipment I had,' he said.

'The sequence of burning a gas and burning another gas should not have happened in that way.'

But he said the lab was disorganised and 'something would have happened eventually anyways'.

'The whole environment in that school, in the lab was very dangerous,' he said.

Mr Vargas said strong acids and bases were left in places where they were accessible by students.

'I made management aware of the fact that that needs to be locked away,' he said.

'That was just in cabinets in the classroom so any student could have opened it.'

Mr Vargas also said the lab technician was overworked and did not organise experiments, there was no curriculum and no text books.

Perth Waldorf School administrator Bruce Uchiyama-Lee said the experiment was not curriculum-based and should not have been conducted

'I have to say about Waldorf school there is no set curriculum per se,' he said.

'The advice I was given, I had to follow a German chemist [Manfred] Von Mackensen, he is very popular with the Waldorf Schools.'

Perth Waldorf School is a Rudolf Steiner School, which places emphasis on the whole development of the child — spiritual, physical, moral and academic.

Mr Vargas said it was 'absolutely not fair' that the blame for the incident was placed solely on him.

'Of course I let down the team in a certain way but the team let me down at the same time,' he said.

'I've done a mistake in a team where there were a lot of mistakes being done, just one of many mistakes being done at that school, at the particular department and my one blew up.'

Mr Vargas added that he had been in contact with the boy with severed tendons.

'There is no hard feelings whatsoever, not of the parents, not of that boy,' he said.

Mr Vargas said he made a 'mistake' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was 'very dangerous'

'He is of the opinion that accidents happen. 

'Of course I feel for the boys, I feel greatly for those boys, I'm really, really sorry they got injured.'

Mr Uchiyama-Lee rejected Mr Vargas's claim the lab was unsafe.

'That had nothing to do with running an inappropriate experiment,' he said.

'The school hadn't been told by the teacher there were any issues from the lab.'

Mr Uchiyama-Lee said  the school 'did not accept the claims being made by Mr Vargas', based on the extensive investigation conducted by the school into the incident.

'The investigation saw no link between the resources provided at the school and the experiment conducted by the teacher,' he said.

'The school sees these alleged claims as spurious.

'The school has sucessfully conducted a well run chemistry and science program for many years without incident and the resources, where requested, have always been provided in a timely manner.

'The school's primary concern has and always will be the safety and wellbeing of the students.'
