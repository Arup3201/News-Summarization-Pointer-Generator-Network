Ed Miliband has been thrown an election lifeline as a new opinion poll reveals that Labour could avoid a total wipeout in Scotland.

The TNS survey, published today, reveals a ten-point gap between Labour and the Nationalists, while around a quarter of voters remain undecided ahead of May’s contest.

If replicated in the General Election, the SNP would still seize a huge number of seats from its old rival, sending a record number of MPs to Westminster.

But some of Labour’s biggest names would cling on with reduced majorities, including Douglas Alexander, Margaret Curran and Anas Sarwar.

The picture remains incredibly bleak for the Lib Dems, however, with only 4 per cent of Scots set to vote for the party.

That could leave it with only two seats, terminating the political careers of Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, Women’s Minister Jo Swinson and former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore.

The Tories would enjoy a mini-revival, adding an extra seat to their current tally of one.

Britain’s leading elections expert Professor John Curtice said: ‘Today’s poll gives Scottish Labour some hope of minimising the damage that the SNP threatens to inflict on its representation at Westminster.

‘If the SNP lead is kept down to ten points, as this poll suggests could happen, the party might still hang on to half its seats at Westminster. Even so, such an outcome could still scupper Ed Miliband’s hopes of winning a Commons majority.’

TNS surveyed 1,006 adults aged 18 and over between January 14 and February 2. Unusually for a pollster, voters were interviewed face-to-face, rather than over the phone or online.

Among those who stated a preference and said they were certain to vote, the SNP is on 41 per cent – double its share of the vote in 2010. Labour trails on 31 per cent, with the Tories on 16 per cent, the Greens on 6 per cent, the Lib Dems on 4 per cent and UKIP on 2 per cent.

With a uniform swing across the country, that would hand the Nationalists 35 seats and reduce Labour’s total from 41 to 20.

The findings differ from most other recent polls, which gave the SNP a much bigger lead. A YouGov survey published last week put the SNP on 48 per cent, with Labour on 27 per cent.

Tom Costley, head of TNS Scotland said: ‘Twenty-six per cent of all adults aged 18-plus in Scotland, and 24 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote on the day, are currently undecided, suggesting there is still considerable scope for all parties to influence the final results.’

A spokesman for Scottish Labour said: ‘This poll shows yet again that only Scottish Labour is big enough to defeat the SNP in Scotland.’

SNP General Election campaign director Angus Robertson MP said: ‘This poll shows a strong lead for the SNP – but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted and will work hard for every vote and seat in May.

‘It will come as a major blow to Jim Murphy and the Labour leadership in Scotland that since taking over as Labour leader last year, people are no more likely to vote for Labour than they were under Johann Lamont. People can only make Scotland’s priorities Westminster’s priorities by voting SNP in May.’
