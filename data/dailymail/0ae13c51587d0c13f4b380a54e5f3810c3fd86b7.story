'It was very frightening': Hannah White (pictured) nearly died from a flesh-eating bug after being bitten by a spider in her local park

A jogger almost died after being bitten by a spider and infected with a deadly bug.

Hannah White, 29, was doing press-ups in her local park when the spider bit her right thigh. Within days, her leg had swollen to twice its normal size.

The condition was caused by a rare flesh-eating bug, which entered her body via the spider bite wound.

Doctors told Miss White she would die unless they removed part of her thigh, which could have left her disabled for life. But, miraculously, she managed to fight off the infection naturally.

Her case follows that of Natalie Hemme, who almost lost an arm when she was bitten by a household spider.

Recovering in hospital yesterday, Miss White, a broadcaster who worked on the sailing events at this summer’s Olympics, said she was lucky to be alive. She assumed the bite was from a mosquito when it appeared after she exercised in Regent’s Park, London, eight days ago.

But by the following day, it began to swell, with the redness spreading down her leg. She went to her local NHS drop-in centre, which prescribed antibiotics, but when the swelling became unbearable her parents took her to A&E.

Doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital in London were baffled, originally diagnosing an abscess. They monitored the swelling every two hours and gave antibiotics intravenously. But by Monday morning, they realised she had all the symptoms of necrotising fasciitis, an infection that eats away at human flesh.

‘It was very frightening,’ said Miss White, who spent seven years competing as a professional sailor.

‘One minute it was just a bite and then the next minute I’m in A&E. It looked as if it would have been surgery or death.

‘They told me, “You can’t kill it with drugs, the only way to get rid of it is to cut it out”.’

But before doctors could operate, the swelling began to subside. By yesterday, the infection was all but cleared up and Miss White was preparing to go home.

‘I’m a medical marvel. The doctors couldn’t believe it,’ she said. Doctors said she must have an extremely strong immune system, as the bug kills up to a quarter of those infected.

‘They said that because I’m fit and strong my body must have stopped the bacteria getting absolute hold of me,’ Miss White said. ‘My body has been fighting it all week – I’m exhausted.

‘It’s absolutely amazing that all this happened just because of a spider bite. I’ve travelled the world doing potentially dangerous things and I’ve been fine. I can’t believe that this has happened to me here at home in London.’

On Thursday, civil servant Mrs Hemme, 31, from South-West London, told the Daily Mail how she developed compartment syndrome, causing the flesh on her arm to die, after she was bitten as she slept.
