Target: Joss Stone leaves Exeter Crown Court after giving evidence against the pair who plotted to kill her

Two men were convicted yesterday of plotting to decapitate Joss Stone with a samurai sword.

The singer was the target of a shockingly violent scheme by Kevin Liverpool and Junior Bradshaw, who labelled her a ‘she-devil’ and wanted to kill her because of her links to the Royal Family.

The pair, described as ‘cannabis-smoking layabouts’, were stopped as they drove to the pop star’s home in Devon with a car full of weapons.

Miss Stone, 25, who had given evidence at their trial, said she was glad they would now be prevented from ‘causing harm to anyone’.

Liverpool and Bradshaw’s plan was described in court as a ‘crazy scheme’ hatched by ‘deluded incompetents’ who crashed their car, lost their way, and asked for directions while waving a picture of the singer.

A judge jailed 35-year-old Liverpool for life yesterday, with a minimum term of ten years and eight months.

Bradshaw, 32, diagnosed as suffering from ‘disorganised schizophrenia’, will be sentenced following psychiatric reports.

Judge Francis Gilbert QC said that despite their failings, the pair had set out in June 2011 with the clear intention of killing Miss Stone.

He told Liverpool: ‘It may have been a crazy scheme from a crazy person and likely to fail but when you decided to travel to Devon you intended to carry it out.’

Referring to Miss Stone, who is worth an estimated £10million, he continued: ‘You intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river, according to your words, and then leave the country with your accomplice Junior Bradshaw.’

Guilty: Kevin Liverpool, 35, left, and Junior Bradshaw, 32, right, who 
travelled to Joss Stone's home with a cache of weapons in their battered Fiat Punto

He added: ‘It is clear from your text
messages on your phone that from as early as November 2010 you had been
planning to rob someone for what you hoped would be in excess of 
£1million.

‘By January 2011 you wanted a semi-automatic handgun and you had identified Joss Stone as the target.

‘You had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer. 
‘You assumed as she was a friend of the Royal Family she would be able to give you money of that sort of amount.’

The jury at Exeter Crown Court took four hours to find the pair guilty of conspiracy to rob and kill Miss Stone.

Relief: Joss Stone's mother Wendy Joseph, who has attended the trial every day, said she was pleased the defendants were 'no longer in a position to cause harm to anyone' after the verdicts

The pop star, who was at home at the 
time – with the doors of her £500,000 property unlocked – told the court
that she had been enjoying ‘a really nice day’ until officers told her 
about the plot.

Joss Stone's mother Wendy Joseph, who has attended the trial every day, said she was pleased the defendants were 'no longer in a position to cause harm to anyone' after the verdicts.

The soul singer said: ‘I am relieved 
the trial is now over and that these men are no longer in a position to 
cause harm to anyone.

‘I’d like to thank everyone for all their support and kind wishes.’

Liverpool and Bradshaw had driven down to Devon from the bed-sit they shared in Manchester in a battered Fiat Punto.

They were equipped with a samurai sword, knives, hammers, a large metal spike, balaclavas, a hosepipe and plastic bags.

When officers searched the men’s flat
they found a self-cocking crossbow and a BB gun. Police also discovered
‘garbled’ notes about Miss Stone which referred to decapitating her and
questioned her links to the royals.

Cache of weapons: The hapless defendants were also found with a hammer when they were arrested by police

The defendants were also found with this lock knife when their plot to kill came unravelled

Tools: A garden hose and black binbags which were also recovered from Bradshaw and Liverpool's Fiat Punto

Plan: A roll of black tape and a black sock which were also recovered from the vehicle

Evidence: Joss Stone addresses the court during the trial in front of Judge Francis Gilbert QC

She had performed at a concert organised by Princes William and Harry, and attended William’s wedding in April 2011.

The prosecution said the pair hated the Royal Family and targeted Miss Stone because of her connections to them.

But despite their preparation, the 
men’s defence lawyers told the jury that the pair were simply incapable 
of carrying out the plot.

It began to unravel towards the end 
of their journey to Devon, when they left a motorway services forecourt 
without paying for fuel, before crashing into railings.

Police attended but did not search 
the badly damaged vehicle and were unaware of the petrol theft, allowing
the pair to continue their journey. They then got lost in the country 
lanes surrounding Miss Stone’s home.

Stash: A samurai sword found in the boot of the Fiat Punto that Kevin Liverpool and Junior Bradshaw had driven to Cullohampton, Devon, from their home in Manchester

Chilling: A pistol was recovered when police carried out raids on the defendants' home in Manchester

Weaponry: This crossbow was recovered during raids on the property Bradshaw and Liverpool shared in Manchester

Caught: The two men's arrest, just a few miles from Miss Stone's home was captured on CCTV

At one point they showed a postman a 
picture of the singer and asked if he knew where she lived. Their odd 
behaviour alerted the suspicions of local residents, several of whom 
called the police. 

As she gave evidence last month Miss Stone admitted security at her home was lax.

She claimed: ‘I’ve lived in Devon for
a long time and nobody really shuts their door.’ During the trial, 
psychiatrist Dr Michael Alcock said Bradshaw suffered from disorganised 
schizophrenia and had an extremely poor concept of time.

He explained: ‘Each day is the same 
to him. He is like a goldfish in a bowl.’ And Liverpool’s own lawyer 
described his client as a ‘fantasist’. 

A relative of Bradshaw told the Mail:
‘In criminal history there has always been one who was the brawn and 
one who was the brains – but these two were neither.

Bungled: The Fiat Punto the pair were travelling in crashed on the way south from Manchester and they were spoken to by police

Balaclavas: These were found in the back of the Fiat Punto when Liverpool and Bradshaw were held by police

Two sets of black gloves were also recovered from the vehicle which it is thought the defendants were going to use to cover their tracks
