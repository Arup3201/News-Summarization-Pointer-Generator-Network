Some may deem them as vain whereas others may argue they are simply catching the moment in the best way possible.

But whatever reason people feel the need to hold a camera at an unnatural angle and pose, there is no denying that 2013 was the year of the selfie.

Oxford Dictionaries even named the phrase as the word of the year, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming.

One of the most famous selfies of the past 12 months was the Pope posing with teenagers at the Vatican.

The picture went viral on social media and was widely speculated as being the first ever 'Papal selfie'.

Among the most controversial of the year was earlier this
 month when U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David
 Cameron posed for a selfie at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in 
Johannesburg.

Not that 
it will ever be seen - when the Danish prime minister was asked if she'd
 reveal the photo she said, resoundingly, no and admitted 'it isn't a 
particularly good picture.'

The Kardashian family are now synonymous with selfies - one of the most famous selfies of the year was Kim Kardashian's post-pregnancy bum shot in a white swimsuit, which garnered nearly a million likes on Instagram.

An
 eye-brow raising selfie was taken by Samantha Cameron’s sister on the 
morning of her wedding day, revealing David Cameron napping on a 
four-poster bed in the background.

Not to be outdone Labour leader Ed Miliband later posed for a selfie with popstar Lily Allen which she posted on her Twitter page.

An example of a tasteless selfie was when a news photographer captured a shot of a
 tourist snapping a selfie in front of a Brooklyn Bridge jumper, while one of the luckiest was when reporter Kelly Nash captured the moment a baseball flew narrowly past her head at Fenway Park stadium in Boston.

One
 of the strangest was when Florida student Malik Whiter saw that his 
teacher went into labor during class and pulled out his phone, 
positioned himself just so in front of the pain-stricken woman and 
smiled for the camera.

'Selfie with my teacher while she having contractions,' Whiter tweeted in October.

She caused outrage at this year’s MTV VMAs so it’s not surprising that Miley Cyrus chose a memorable outfit from the same event for Halloween. The controversial star tweeted a picture of herself dressed up in Lil' Kim’s daring outfit from the 1999 awards show, with just a nipple pastie protecting her modesty

Pop singer by day, unintentional animal activist by night: Thai police arrested two men for selling photo ops with protected-species the slow loris after Rihanna posted a picture of herself with one on Instagram

The
 photo featuring Whiter's grinning mug with mirrored sunglasses and a 
beanie on his head in the foreground, and his terrified-looking teacher 
in the background, became an instant viral hit.

But
 one would-be Romeo's unusual attempt to woo a woman he met in Starbucks
 spectacularly backfired after his selfie video went viral.

In
 an apparent attempt to secure a date, the man  - dubbed 
'StarbucksDrakeHands guy' online - sent the 'seductive' video to the 
woman.

But the 16-second
 clip, in which he gazes into the camera, did not have the effect he 
intended set to the song Hold On, We're Going Home, by Drake, the man 
stares intently at the camera pulling his best model pose - it  sparked 
dozens of ruthless imitations after being posted online.

And
 singer Justin Bieber was caught out yet again, this time on a grainy 
video 'selfie' that has been posted online by a girl who had partied 
with the star - the video shows Bieber sleeping peacefully, wrapped in a
 brown blanket on a large striped day bed.

Social networking website Facebook is the place where the most selfies are uploaded.

Half
 of us (48 per cent) post pictures of ourselves that we’ve taken on 
Facebook, 9 per cent post to Twitter and 5 per cent use the app Snapchat
 - although most celebrities opt for Instagram.

Selfie was added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in August, but is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary, although it is being considered for future use - maybe 2014 will be the year it arrives in the print version of most esteemed guardian of the English language.
