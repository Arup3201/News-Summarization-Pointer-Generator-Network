Big-ticket item: Sales of iconic Aga cookers are in decline

At the height of Britain's property boom, no eye-wateringly expensive farmhouse conversion was complete without a gleaming Aga in the high-spec kitchen.

But in 2012, with the country still firmly in the grip of recession, sales of the pricey cast iron cookers are in decline - prompting the manufacturer to target China as a new market for growth.

Announcing a sharp drop in half-year profits, Aga Rangemaster blamed the lack of activity in the property market as customers delayed buying big ticket items.

Some Aga models can cost over £5,000.

The firm, which also produces 
fridges, sinks and stoves, said it expected markets in the UK and in 
Ireland to remain tough 'for some time'.

Half-year pre-tax profits at the Leamington Spa-based company were £1.6 million - compared with £4.2 million a year earlier.

Revenues in the first half were 1.8 per cent lower at £119.2 million.

Aga Rangemaster is planning to concentrate on boosting sales in North America as well as China in a bid to rejuvenate profits.

Chief executive William McGrath said: 'With the established UK and Irish markets likely to remain weak for some time in the current economic environment, the onus is on new markets such as China and on raising market penetration in markets like North America, where our market position is not yet fully developed.'

He said the firm was busy developing new products, including a five-oven electric Aga due to be launched next month, and had driven sale volumes of its classic Aga four per cent higher with the help of promotions and stock clearances over the half year.

The Aga cooker was invented in Sweden in 1922.
