Canned: The BBC faces further questions over why a 10-minute Newsnight film looking into allegations of child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile (above) was dropped last December

A leaked email has cast doubt on the BBC's reason for cancelling a Newsnight investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile.

The corporation has previously insisted that it decided not to proceed with the Newsnight film for 'editorial reasons' because the abuse story 'could not be substantiated'.

But an internal email discussing the investigation into the late DJ suggests that the show was scrapped because of concerns it would clash with the TV channel's planned Christmas tributes to the star.

The email dated on December 7, published by The Times today, reveals the investigation into abuse by Savile was so well advanced by then that the 
press office was preparing 'lines to take' to respond to questions after
its planned broadcast.

The email, sent from a press officer to Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and other staff, shows that the BBC was aware of 
the risk that the report would raise questions about why it had failed 
to expose Savile as a paedophile while he was alive.

The press officer wrote that 'we may 
well need to do a bit of managing around this' and that 'we should bear 
in mind how BBC complaints team respond'.

It also contradicts claims by the BBC that the film focused on  an alleged failure by police to investigate Savile properly and that Newsnight journalists were in fact 'focusing on allegations of abuse'.

Rippon has previously claimed that the 
story his journalists had been pursuing had been 'weakened from a 
Newsnight perspective' because they had been unable to establish any 'institutional failure' by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service.

Investigation: Scotland Yard is now investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse case involving dozens of potential victims

Rob Wilson, the Conservative MP for Reading East, who obtained the email, said: 'Newsnight editor Peter Rippon and the BBC have sought to portray that the axed Newsnight report was not an expose of Savile, but was focused on the reasons the police and the CPS dropped their investigation.

'This leaked email and the evidence from internal BBC sources casts doubt on the carefully crafted version of events posted in Peter Rippon's blog on October 2.

'We need a full explanation of why the focus of the Newsnight expose of Jimmy Savile was abruptly changed at the last minute.'

Responding to the leaked email, the BBC spokesman said: 'This ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the BBC has previously said on this.

'It is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the Newsnight producer asking for further information about the Jimmy Savile investigation.'

Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle has previously issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims

She added that the email would be passed to the inquiry into whether there were any failings in the way the Newsnight report was handled.

Ex-Sky News executive Nick Pollard is to lead the BBC's independent review into the matter while former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith will lead a second examination into the 'culture and practices of the BBC' during the years Savile worked there.

On the defence: Newsnight editor Peter Rippon (above) said the current affairs show dropped the story because it 'had not established any institutional failure' on behalf of the police or Crown Prosecution Service

The disclosures about Savile's private life were made in an ITV documentary a fortnight ago.

Around 60 people have now come forward to say they were a victim of the veteran DJ, TV presenter and charity campaigner.

Police believe the disgraced star, who died a year ago, may have been abusing victims for decades.

The BBC and other bodies could be sued by victims if it can be shown they were negligent in allowing Savile to prey on his young victims.

A Department of Health investigation will also be conducted into Savile's conduct during his charity work at three hospitals - Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary.Labour has called for an independent inquiry as the fall-out from the revelations continues.

BBC director general George Entwistle and former corporation stalwart Esther Rantzen have become involved as questions are asked about who knew of the rumours about Savile, what and when they heard about them, and whether enough was done to stop him.

But a spokeswoman for the BBC dismissed 
the email as 'simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the 
Newsnight producer asking for further information about the Jimmy Savile
investigation'.
