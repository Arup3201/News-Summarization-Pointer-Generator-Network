Liverpool duo Mario Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge are among a host of footballers to pay their tributes on social media to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York.

On the 13th anniversary of the tragedy, memorial services have been on across the United States as the country pays tribute to the nearly 3,000 victims who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.

Tweeting pictures and tribute messages several Premier League stars including Mesut Ozil, have taken to their social media accounts to pay their respects. 

Most of the pictures feature two blue columns of light put up in New York which represent the towers. 

The vivid tribute illuminated the skies over Lower Manhattan  on Wednesday night and will shine until early Friday.
