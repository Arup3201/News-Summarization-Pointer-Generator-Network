Another night in Europe, another disappointment for Manchester City.

Roberto Mancini, Manuel Pellegrini... the name on the manager’s door does not seem to matter when it comes to the holy grail of the Champions League.

So why is it that the champions of England struggle when they head into Europe? Sportsmail takes a look at five reasons.

Playing in a library 

Whisper this in the blue corner of Manchester, but Old Trafford came alive on European nights. Manchester United fans were often criticised for their decibel levels in the Premier League but the prawn sandwich brigade were drowned out in the Champions League.

Yes, group matches against lesser rivals can be a tedious, pointless and heavy drain on the wallet but not when Serie A giants Roma are in town, surely.

Six wins out of six, joint top of the table, and Ashley Cole’s first return to England as a tasty side dish. Not enough for the home supporters, apparently.

Manchester City failed to sell out their crucial Champions League game against Roma on Tuesday night 

By contrast Roma were handed a huge lift by their packed away end rammed with passionate supporters 

A half-empty Etihad Stadium certainly did not impress Paul Scholes, United legend turned TV pundit.

‘They've got the team, they've definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don't think they do,’ was the damning verdict from Scholes. Busy tweeter Rio Ferdinand posed the question: ‘Would fans rather watch Ramsay’s Kitchen?’

Ouch. Double ouch given the United leanings.

Not even the Manchester return of Ashley Cole could rouse the fans to turn up in their droves

Misfiring strikers 

Four goals in the two games leading up to this one meant that expectations were high for Edin Dzeko but he found the Roma defence a step up from Hull and, er, Sheffield Wednesday. Strange, that.

The Bosnian can be infuriatingly inconsistent, which is why his City career includes so many substitute appearances. He was clearly disappointed when he was taken off for James Milner but with Stevan Jovetic coming back from injury, this was Dzeko’s chance to show why he should be first choice when all the forwards are up and running.

Credit should go to Roma’s defenders, too. They have only conceded three goals all season and Tuesday night’s was from the penalty spot.

Sergio Aguero was the scorer but that was the high point. The Argentine has five goals in eight games this season but did not look anything like the deadly menace he was for most of the last campaign until his thigh and hamstring problems started. He is a player of sublime quality but needed to show it against Roma.

Edin Dzeko is sometimes infuriating to watch when he leads the line for Manuel Pellegrini's side 

No-no for Yaya 

Last season’s player of the year is another who appears to have taken several steps backwards since the summer.

Rather like Steven Gerrard at Liverpool, Toure is the go-to player when things are going wrong on the pitch. He can break up play, he can pick a forward pass and he can gallop forwards and score blinders. But that’s when he is on form.

Whether it is the speculation of his departure after the ‘birthday cake affair’, or whether it is an emotional hangover from the death of his brother – which would be quite understandable – Toure is not making his usual impact.

Roma were ripped apart by injuries on Tuesday night so it could have been Toure’s stage. He did not take the opportunity.

Yaya Toure has struggled with his performances since a summer of discontent at the Etihad Stadium

Spanish sighs 

Boss Pellegrini had this game down as a must-win, which meant he had to look for creators who could unpick the Italian lock. Full backs Maicon – a flop at the Etihad and made to look a dummy by Gareth Bale four years ago – and veteran Ashley Cole would have been targeted, pre-match as possible weak links. Oh dear. 

Yes Maicon conceded the penalty, for which he was booked, but that apart the Brazilian looked a player transformed from his City experience. Equally Cole was comfortable in his role.

Jesus Navas was so bad that he only lasted 45 minutes while fellow Spaniard David Silva gave his all but could not find the creative spark which was required.

Jesus Navas was hooked at half-time after struggling to exert himself on the game from the start 

Maicon was seen as a weak link before the fixture but had a superb game rampaging forward from the back

Leaving Les Rosbifs on the bench 

A galaxy of talented foreigners on the pitch, two dyed-in-the-wool, no-nonsense English players sitting on the bench. Yet when James Milner and Frank Lampard were finally let loose, City started to re-discover their drive.

Milner is one of those players who gets an unfair press – just look at the managers who have selected him for club and country. In ice-cream terms, he is vanilla. No frills, no chocolate topping, but utterly reliable as he showed that again on Tuesday night.

As for Lampard, Frankie boy is enjoying his own Indian summer since his departure from Chelsea and was the manager’s pick to replace Dzeko.

Had those two been on from the start, dictating the tempo and added some English grit, who knows what might have happened against a Roma side who had key players out, including Kevin Strootman. And before anyone brings up thirty-something Lampard’s age, think Francesco Totti, 38.
