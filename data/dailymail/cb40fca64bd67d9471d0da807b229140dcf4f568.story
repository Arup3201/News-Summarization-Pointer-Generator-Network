Harold Morgan, 85, was given a send off to remember today after a social media appeal for mourners to attend his funeral went viral

Hundreds of mourners turned out to pay their respects at the funeral of a former soldier following a Facebook appeal after he died alone.

Former Welsh Guardsman Harold Morgan, 85, was given a send off to remember with long lost friends, relatives and total strangers packing out St. Tathan Church in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales.

The church had feared they would struggle to fill a single row of pews for the funeral of Mr Morgan - who had lived in a care home in Barry for the past 14 years.

The former railwayman died with little known about his family and officials said it would be 'horrible' if no-one attended his send-off. 

So the Reverend Rachel Simpson, the curate who led the service, posted a message on the church's Facebook page on Monday which was quickly shared by others.

Also at today's service were representatives from the fire service, police and Royal British Legion as well as youngsters from a military college.

The funeral was so well attended that there were no spare seats inside the 14th century church - and speakers had to be set up so mourners standing outside in the rain could hear the service.

Reverend Rachel Simpson said she had been worried she would be addressing a virtually empty church for the service.

She said: 'Two days ago, Harold was known and loved by only a small few and by god.

'But there was an amazing response - bringing people here to pay their last respects even though they didn't know him.'

Mourners filled every row at today's service at St. Tathan Church in the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales

Mr Morgan, the eldest of five children, was born in Barnsley in 1929.

At the age of 17, he left school and joined the Welsh Guards for five years and was posted to Palestine during a 'time of deep turmoil' in the region.

Reverend Simpson added: 'It wasn't a happy time for him, but like the reserved gentleman he was, he kept his views to himself.'

But one memorable moment from his time there was when the Yorkshireman - whose family were originally from Wales - played a game of rugby in the sand while wearing military boots.

After returning home, he was discharged from the Army on medical grounds and moved to Reading, where he became a signalman in 1955.

When his year long-marriage ended, he moved to Carmarthen, where he later worked as a carpenter and then a book-keeper.

While in Wales, the massive train enthusiast co-founded the Welsh Railyway Research Circle and in 1984 saw his book, South Wales Branch Lines, published.

Reverend Simspon added: 'The circle now has more than 500 members - which is testament to his dedication.

Although described as a 'very private person', Mr Morgan was renowned for having a wicked sense of humour and always finding the lighter side of life in every situation

'He was very well respected among his peers.'

Although described as a 'very private person', Mr Morgan was renowned for having a wicked sense of humour and always finding the lighter side of life in every situation.

He later lived in St Athan, but moved to College Fields Nursing Home in Barry after suffering a stroke.

Reverend Simpson told the congregation: 'On November 2, his health problems got the better of him and, in his own words, 'the chief foreman above signalled the closing of his regulator'.

'He departed to that great marshalling yard in the sky.' 

The service featured a battalion bugler playing the Last Post with two standard bearers in uniform displaying regimental flags

Forces veteran Tony Evans, 67, decided to attend the service after hearing about the story on the news.

He said: 'We are a family regiment so once you're a member, you're always a member.'

Charlotte Jenkins, of St Athan, said she felt it was important to be there too.

The 29-year-old, who stood outside with her ten-month-old daughter, said: 'I work with the elderly so I thought it was important for people in the community to give thanks for this man because he was in the forces.'

The small church in south Wales was so busy today that some mourners had to stand outside in the rain

Also in attendance were 30 students from the Military Preparation College in Cardiff

Senior director Brian Edwards said: 'This week has all been about remembering those who gave their lives for their country.

'So we were determined to support the church's appeal.'

Mr Morgan will be buried tomorrow at a cemetery in Abermule, Wales.
