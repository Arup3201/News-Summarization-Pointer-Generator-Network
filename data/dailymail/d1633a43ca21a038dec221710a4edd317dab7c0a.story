A middle schooler from Wisconsin got a heartwarming surprise on Friday when her father came home early from a tour of duty in Afghanistan just a few days before Veterans Day.

Sgt. Scott Anderson showed up at South Park Middle School in Oshkosh to embrace his daughter Isabella whom he hadn't seen in nearly half a year.

'I thought I was in trouble when Ms. McLaughlin came to get me. I was kinda shocked! I wasn’t expecting it,' Isabella told FOX 11 as she held back tears of joy.

Shocked: Isabella cried tears of joy after her soldier father surprised her while she was at school 

Reunited: Isabella and Scott hadn't seen each other since June and Isabella didn't expect her father to come home until sometime in the middle of next summer 

'Is this, like for real, or am I dreaming?' she asked her father after seeing him for the first time since June.

Sgt. Scott Anderson was given the option of cutting his latest tour in Afghanistan short and his daughter didn't think he'd be home until next summer.

'I thought he was coming home in the middle of next summer and I was not expecting this at all,' she explained.

Anderson was one of the troops who was drawn from Afghanistan early and he wanted to share his moment with the media to distract away from all the negative events that get reported

'There’s a lot of negative stuff that gets reported in the news and I thought, "well, if I get a chance to put something positive out there, that happens to be very personal to me, why not?"' said Anderson.

The Andersons said that being apart isn't easy but that it's for a brave cause.

Tears of Joy: Isabella was overwhelmed with emotion on Friday after receiving a surprise visit from her father who came early from a tour of duty in Afghanistan 

 Scott Anderson said he feels blessed to be able to spend time with his daughter.

'It is difficult, but at the same time, I realize I’m doing something that not a whole lot of people can do and providing freedoms for everybody,' explained Anderson.

Isabella seconded her father's sentiment.  

'Yeah, but, you know, he’s doing a good thing. It takes a lot of hard work to have to stay away from your family and protect a lot of people,' said Isabella.

Good news: Scott Anderson wanted to share the touching moment of reuniting with his daughter on the news to deflect away from all the negative media attention surrounding troops 

Blessed: Isabella says she is blessed to be able to spend time with her father and that while its difficult to be apart, she knows he is fighting for a good cause
