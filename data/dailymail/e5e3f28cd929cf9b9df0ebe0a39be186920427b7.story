A 13-year-old girl miraculously survived a chain-reaction crash in Indiana that killed both her grandparents and severely mangled the white Toyota SUV in which she was riding.

Katrina Tucker of Minneapolis waited trapped inside the car for almost an hour before emergency personnel managed to pull her from the wreckage and airlift her to a hospital in Indianapolis, where she was in critical but stable condition with a broken hip, arm and leg. 

'You could 
see just a little spot of bluejeans; that’s how I knew someone was in 
the back,' said  
Sheriff’s Deputy Landon Dean, who was the first responder to approach the vehicle. 'I could hear her crying.'

Dean told the Star Tribune that  the back seat was 'folded on top' of the 
girl, pushing her 'down on the floorboard. I’m sure she never saw her 
grandparents' during the entire time she awaited being freed.

'You just 
wouldn’t believe that she was able to survive that accident,' said Dean, who called 
it 'a miracle [that] she is going to be OK.'

The teenager was recovering at the intensive care unit at Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Her parents arrived on Sunday morning, according to the AP.

The crash occurred during stop-and-go traffic at around noon on Saturday 35 miles east of Indianapolis.

Sylvia K. Shaw, 66, and John L. Shaw, 66, 
both of New Brighton, Minnesota, were returning from a trip to Washington, DC, with their granddaughter Katrina, and on their way to Indianapolis to visit relatives. 

A semitrailer truck struck the Shaws' SUV from behind, pushing the smaller vehicle into the back of another big rig and then into another car, authorities said. Traffic had been slowing ahead of construction that limited that section of Interstate 70 to one lane, according to the Courier Times.

The Shaws were deemed dead at the scene of the accident near New Castle, Indiana. Their vehicle was 'absolutely unrecognizable', the deputy said.

Everyone in the SUV had on 
seat belts, he added.

All 
passengers in the other vehicles escaped without injury in the crash, 
which blocked westbound traffic for three hours.

The driver 
of the semi that hit the SUV, Richard Engstrom, 59, of Indianapolis, 'didn’t know traffic was stopped for some reason', Dean said. 'There’s a
 question about how long he had been driving [without a break].'

He said the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.

Time on the road is suspected of playing a role in another crash that occurred recently in New Jersey that injured actor and comedian Tracy Morgan. A National 
Transportation Safety Board report said the driver of the semi that hit a van carrying Morgan was speeding and that its
 driver had been working more than 13 consecutive hours.
