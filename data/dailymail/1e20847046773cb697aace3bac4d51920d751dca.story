Joe Hart has faced little competition for his England place since he took over the No 1 jersey in 2010. But that might be about to change.

Saturday afternoon saw two England goalkeepers go head-to-head and both kept clean sheets. Fraser Forster for Southampton and Ben Foster for West Brom in a 0-0 draw on the south coast.

In fact this also happened as recently as February when Manchester City were held goalless at Norwich with Hart in one goal and John Ruddy in the other. After being cruelly left at home in the summer, Ruddy is now in the Championship and seemingly out of the England picture for the moment.

Lion-Hart: Joe Hart has been unchallenged as England's No 1 goalkeeper for some time

Contender: Ben Foster kept a clean sheet on Saturday as West Brom earned a point at Southampton 

In the running: Fraser Forster has the chance to stake his claim by playing for Southampton in the top flight

So what of the other two? Foster is a Roy Hodgson favourite from their time together at The Hawthorns – why else would a player who deserted England, and before that failed to grasp a fantastic opportunity at Manchester United when Fergie gave him a chance, jump instantly to the No 2 spot with his country?

Foster regularly makes some good saves for Albion, to be fair, but as we saw when he had a rush of blood and wrongly chose to race out to the edge of his box in the first-half on Saturday, he’s capable of a cock-up. 

Age isn’t on Foster’s side compared with Hart and Forster – even if he takes his game up a level it’s unlikely he will get a move to a top club in the Champions League at this stage of his career.

Plenty to ponder: Roy Hodgson will soon select his squad for the first Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland

Goalkeepers' union: Foster and Forster embrace after Saturday's match ends in a goalless stalemate 

Forster is a different case, and in many ways an unknown quantity. If Hodgson can ignore his bias towards Foster then the Southampton keeper has a chance of staking a claim of being the main challenger to Hart.

Forster had largely been untested in the Scottish Premiership during his time with Celtic, but certain Champions League performances have made people pay attention, and persuaded Southampton to pay £10m for the big man from Hexham.

I expect Forster to be given a busy time at Saints this season, and if he comes up with some stand-out, points-saving performances, he will be hard to ignore. 

Commanding: Hart comes out to punch the ball clear under pressure in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Liverpool on Monday night

Competition: Hart knows he needs to be on top form to keep Willy Caballero out of the City side

Hart needs to stay focused – something he didn’t do at the start of last season. He has Willy Caballero – a Pellegrini favourite – breathing down his neck at club level so he can’t afford to make mistakes.

If his form slips, he’ll be left out at City in a heartbeat (excuse the pun). When he was dropped by Pellegrini last season, Hart kept his place in the England team. But only because there were no alternatives Hodgson could justifiably turn to.

Forster is a serious alternative. He needs to have a big first season in the Premier League with Southampton.
