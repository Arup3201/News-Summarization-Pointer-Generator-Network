Warning: Rising stars in the party will warn the chancellor to look out for those on middle incomes

An influential group of  Conservative MPs will today call for stamp duty to be scrapped on all homes worth less than £500,000.

The change would be included as part of a package of tax cuts to help Britain’s middle classes.

The Free Enterprise Group will warn George Osborne that he needs to do much more to help those on middle incomes who have faced a severe financial squeeze during the recession.

Proposals are expected to include the scrapping of stamp duty on most homes and a big rise in the threshold at which people start to pay income tax at the higher rate of 40 per cent.

The group – which contains a number of the party’s rising stars – will also call for business rates to be cut to help save the embattled high street and provide a boost to small businesses.

It will argue that the UK has the highest property taxes in the world, and that scrapping stamp duty on properties worth less than £500,000 would help first-time buyers much more than any other measure.

Some 94 per cent of the homes sold in England now attract stamp duty.

Buyers of properties worth more than £250,000 pay three per cent duty on the total price.

But if the threshold had been increased in line with inflation it would now stand at more than £1.2million.

Today’s report is also expected to call for the 40 per cent income tax threshold to be raised from £41,450 to £50,000 to ease pressure on buyers, particularly those in London and the South East where property prices are higher.

Proposals: The influential group will propose a number of measures that will ease the strain on first-time buyers

The group’s recommendations will be passed to the Chancellor ahead of his autumn statement on the economy next month.

Mr
Osborne is also reported to be mulling calls from within the party to 
go beyond his fuel duty freeze and cut taxes at the petrol pumps.

Many Tories are concerned that the recent revival in Britain’s economic fortunes is not yet being felt by traditional Tory voters.

The intervention from the Free Enterprise Group comes as the Liberal Democrats pile pressure on the Chancellor to set aside £1billion a year to help the low paid by raising the personal tax allowance.

The basic rate threshold is already due to rise to £10,000 next year – up from £6,475 at the last election.

And Nick Clegg yesterday said he wanted to see the Government go further by raising the threshold to £10,500 before the election.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that  raising the personal allowance would be worth £100 a year to 24million ordinary taxpayers and take about half a million people out of income tax altogether.

‘As the recovery is finally taking hold I think it is very important that as many people as possible feel that they are benefiting from it,’ he said.

‘That’s why I call it a workers’ bonus.’

And he said the increase could be funded by a levy – such as a ‘mansion tax’ – on the ‘super wealthy’.

But the Conservatives are opposed to the plans for a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2 million, and Mr Clegg acknowledged he had not yet got agreement within the Coalition for his tax plan.

In a further move to distance himself from the Tories, Mr Clegg rejected David Cameron’s call in his Guildhall speech last week for a ‘permanently’ smaller state sector.

He said: ‘You appear to have this view from the right now that taxes should never go up and that in a sense you should be shrinking the state to ever smaller size in a slightly ideological way.

'I don’t think we should be ideological about this.’
