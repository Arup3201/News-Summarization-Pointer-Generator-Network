Nick Clegg’S £600 million free school meals plan has suffered a blow after a Government pilot scheme showed that children who switch from ‘unhealthy’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier.

Supporters of the initiative to give free school meals to all pupils in the first three years of primary school say fattening food in packed lunches is fuelling rising levels of obesity among children. 

But a two-year scheme to test the school meals initiative, in which tens of thousands of children had cooked meals instead of packed lunches, has found there was no change in their health or body mass index, a measure of a person’s healthy weight based on height and gender.

Nick Clegg's proposed school meal plan suffered a blow after Government pilot scheme showed children who switch from packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier

A report for the Department for Education found that although children ate fewer of the fatty and sugary items often found in lunch boxes, such as crisps, sandwiches, sweets and fizzy drinks, they made up for it by eating more roast potatoes and chips in the cooked school meals.

Moreover, children who previously had a packed lunch and a hot meal  at home in the evening were eating extra because they had two cooked meals a day.

The findings were seized on by critics of the Liberal Democrat leader’s initiative unveiled at the party’s conference in Glasgow.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘This is an expensive political gimmick and it is very doubtful that it will contribute much either to the health of the children or their education.

‘The reason why it won’t have much of an 
impact on obesity is that children spend a relatively small part of 
their lives at school, so any obesity will be down to their whole way of
 life with their families, not just those few hours in school.’

The Department of Education study into the two-year scheme, published last year, said that although nearly all primary  children in the two pilot areas – Durham and Newham in London – were eating cooked meals rather than packed lunches, there was no weight loss.

The report said that though children were eating fewer packets of crisps and more vegetables at lunch they could be eating more fatty food outside school hours to compensate.   

The study by NatCen, a social research charity, said there was ‘no evidence that the free school meal pilot led to significant health benefits during the two-year pilot period. For example, there was no evidence of any change in children’s body mass index.’

The researchers cautioned, however, that two years could have been too short a period to see health improvements, and pointed out there were other benefits such as a boost in the pupils’ academic achievements.itch from ‘unhealthy’ packed lunches to cooked meals are no healthier.
