John Hennigan, pictured, who already has an Asbo from making racist gestures, was allegedly caught making Nazi salutes in a pub

A tattooed drinker was caught doing Nazi salutes in a pub, despite already being banned from making racist gestures under an Asbo, a jury heard today.

John Hennigan, 46, was allegedly spotted making the fascist salute by a landlord at the bar of the Magpie pub in Bishopsgate, London.

When he was challenged and thrown out of the bar, Hennigan complained it would not happen if he was black or Jewish, a court heard.

Despite being barred from the premises twice before for making Nazi salutes, Hennigan, from Harlow, Essex, came into the pub around 5pm as workers flocked there to have a post-work tipple.

Pub landlord, Paul MacCallion, was upstairs in his office doing paperwork when he noticed Hennigan on the CCTV screen, the Old Bailey heard.

He said: 'I saw the defendant who I previously barred from the pub on two previous occasions. He was making the Nazi salute to the bar.

'I was trying to make sure it was the same guy as before and was staring at the CCTV and three times I saw him.'

He told the jury he immediately confronted Hennigan who had a pint in his hand 'because I barred him previously because he was making Nazi salutes.

'At that stage I think he said something like "if I was a Jew or c*** you would not be doing this".'

Mr MacCallion added: 'When I got him to the door, he said "so if my mum and dad came down, would they also be barred too? Or do you just let in blacks and Jews?"

'He said something like "you love the N-word... n******".'

He told the jury 'that kind of thing 
disgusts me and makes me angry', saying Hennigan had been aggressive but
spoke in his face as if trying to wind him up.

When he pointed Hennigan out to two police officers it is alleged Hennigan retorted 'Itâ€™s not illegal in this country to do a salute.'

Hennigan, who had an Asbo placed on him at Harlow County Court in April 2005 for seven years, denies breaching it on February 2 of this year.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
