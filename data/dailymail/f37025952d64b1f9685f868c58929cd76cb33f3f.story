Tokyo firm Softbank has unveiled a robot called Pepper, which it says can read human emotions

In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots.

Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. 

Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). 

The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. 

It touched hands with Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, described by the firm as a Genesis or 'E.T.' moment.

Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones.

'Our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile,' Son said. 

Robotic companions are hugely popular in Japan, but no companion robot has emerged as a major market success yet. 

Japanese electronics and entertainment company Sony discontinued the Aibo pet-dog robot in 2006, despite an outcry from its fans.

At that time, Sony had developed a child-shaped entertainment robot similar to Pepper but much smaller, capable of dances and other charming moves. However, it never became a commercial product.

Honda has developed the walking, talking Asimo robot, but that is too sophisticated and expensive for home use, and appears in Honda showrooms and at gala events only.  

Even then, it is prone to glitches because of its complexity.

Many other Japanese companies, including Hitachi and Toyota, not to mention universities and startups, have developed various robots, that entertain and serve as companions.

There is little emphasis on delivering on practical work, in contrast to industrial robots at factories and military robots for war.

But the potential is great for intelligent machines as the number of elderly requiring care is expected to soar in rapidly-aging Japan in coming years.

The 48 inch (121 cm) (48 inch) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) Pepper has no hair. but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. 'Our aim is to develop affectionate robots that can make people smile,' Masayoshi Son said (left)

Robotics are already used to check on the elderly and monitor their health and safety, but they might also play a role in reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation. 

The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years.

But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist.

This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims.

A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly.

This means. if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans.

The 48 inch (121 cm) (48 inch) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest.

It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.

Besides featuring the latest voice recognition, Pepper is loaded with more than a dozen sensors, including two touch sensors in its hands, three touch sensors on its head, and six laser sensors and three bumper sensors in its base.

It also has two cameras and four microphones on its head and has Wi-Fi and ethernet networking capabilities.

In Thursday's demonstration, Pepper sang, 'I want to be loved.' Softbank said Pepper can dance and tell jokes. 

'I've believed that the most important role of robots will be as kind and emotional companions to enhance our daily lives, to bring happiness, constantly surprise us and make people grow,' said Bruno Maisonnier, founder and chief executive of Aldebaran, who appeared on the stage with Son.

Aldebaran has produced more than 5,000 of its Nao humanoid, its first product, which is used for research and educational purposes.
