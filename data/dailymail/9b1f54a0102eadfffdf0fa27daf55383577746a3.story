Gap-toothed Dutch model Lara Stone - who is married to comedian David Walliams - is taking over as the new face of beauty brand L'Oréal Paris.

The new global spokesperson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy, Alfred, in May. The campaign marks a return to work for the supermodel.

She follows in the footsteps of beauty icons Julianne Moore, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, Claudia Schiffer, Doutzen Kroes, Laetitia Casta and Jane Fonda.

Lara's Bardot-esque beauty and sexy gap-toothed grin have made her the darling of the fashion world - she ranked seventh on the Forbes list of top-earning models in 2012

'Lara is a real modern icon,' says Cyril Chapuy, L'Oréal Paris Global Brand President.

'Her rebellious, edgy, sensual beauty has made her so strong and successful. Yet, she remains incredibly genuine, true, sensitive and super fun.

'I love her iconoclastic style and the way she distinguished herself on every single fashion show she walked for. We are thrilled to welcome this exceptional woman and young mother to our brand.'

Lara will be the spokesperson for future great product innovations in several categories, including makeup, hair care and hair colour.

'I am so flattered to join L'Oréal Paris,' says Lara.

'Getting the chance to say "You're worth it" to women around the world is a great honour.

'L'Oréal Paris is a brand that has always understood that beauty and personality go hand in hand. I totally identify myself to the brand values considering my own history and career. Beauty is something you invent for yourself.

'It's a powerful way of claiming who you really are.'

And she tweeted today: 'So happy I finally get to share this exciting bit of news, couldn't be happier!'

'I can now officially say "because we're worth it" how cool is that?!'

With an English father and Dutch mother, Lara Stone was discovered at the age of 12 on a trip to Paris while on a family holiday and started working as a teenager.

It wasn't until 2006, when she was chosen by Givenchy to walk for the label's couture show in Paris, that her career really kicked off.

Lara has since walked for numerous major houses including Chanel, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Lanvin and Fendi.
