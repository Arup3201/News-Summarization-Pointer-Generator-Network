Fears are growing for a young mum who has gone missing with her one-year-old daughter.

Samantha Westwood, 24, disappeared from Darlaston, near Walsall, in the West Midlands, with Tulissia Gelder two days ago and has not been seen since.

Police believe the mum and daughter could be staying with someone she knows but have urged her to make contact as soon as possible.

Missing: Samantha Westwood has disappeared with her one-year-old daughter Tulissia Gelder

Samantha is described as white, 5ft 2ins tall and of small, slim build with green eyes and straight bleached blonde shoulder-length hair.

She has pierced ears and often wears hooped earrings as well as a gold ring on one of her middle fingers.

The young mum also has the word 'Ash' tattooed on the lower part of her left forearm.

Samantha was last seen wearing blue jeggings, a light green fluorescent strap top and a black short leather jacket. 

Police believe she could be carrying a Peppa Pig rucksack and pushing a black buggy.

Her daughter Tulissia is white with short curly blonde hair and green eyes.

The tot has studs in both ears and could be wearing pink and white striped jeans, a pink t-shirt and pink shoes.

Inspector Kelly Monaghan, from Walsall Police, said: 'It’s important we find Samantha and Tulissia to ensure they’re both safe.

'They could be anywhere in the Black Country or perhaps further afield and I would ask members of the public to look out for them.

'If anyone has any information about their whereabouts I would ask them to call us straight away.'
