Migrants who hope to become British citizens will have to learn about 1066, Rudyard Kipling and Olympic hero Jessica Ennis under new citizenship tests, ministers said yesterday.

They will be examined on their knowledge of William the Conqueror, the Reformation and Oliver Cromwell in a reformed version of the tests that must be passed before qualifying for a passport.

But some names familiar to schoolchildren will be missed out of the tests developed by the Home Office.

Question: Those taking the test will be expected to be familiar with details of sporting events including the Olympic Games and to know about sporting icons such as heptathlete Jessica Ennis (pictured)

While the Life in the UK handbooks 
praise Florence Nightingale as ‘the founder of modern nursing’, there is
 no mention of Mary Seacole, her Jamaican-born contemporary promoted 
over the past two decades as of equal importance.

The decision to omit Miss Seacole is 
the second indignity her reputation has suffered in a month. At the end 
of last year Education Secretary Michael Gove instructed she should no 
longer be part of the National Curriculum.

The handbook, to teach newly-arrived 
migrants ‘the values and principles at the heart of being British’, also
 contains no use of the word ‘multicultural’.

History exams will be introduced for 
those wanting to take out British citizenship in March, and the handbook
 they must study is available today.

The citizenship tests first brought in
 by Labour seven years ago contained no questions on history or the 
development of British culture, and instead concentrated on ensuring 
migrants had grasped practicalities like how to make a GP appointment or
 claim benefits.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said:
 ‘We have stripped out mundane information about water meters, how to 
find train timetables, and using the internet.’

People living in Britain should 
already be capable of using public transport, credit cards and coping 
with job interviews, the Home Office said. The history chapter demands 
knowledge of the Stone Age, the Wars of the Roses and the Glorious 
Revolution.

Politicians including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher are featured, alongside literary heroes and heroines.

Industrial pioneers are praised, 
although, oddly, the handbook has a section on Isambard Kingdom Brunel 
but does not mention he was the son of an immigrant.

Musical figures run from Henry 
Purcell to The Beatles and migrants are required to learn about literary
 figures from Geoffrey Chaucer, through Jane Austen to Wilfred Owen.

Those taking the test will also be 
expected to be familiar with details of sporting events including the 
Olympic Games and to know about sporting icons such as heptathlete 
Jessica Ennis.

Existing Life in the UK tests were 
taken by 150,000 people last year. At present it contains 24 multiple 
choice questions and candidates have 45 minutes to answer them. The pass
 mark is 75 per cent.
