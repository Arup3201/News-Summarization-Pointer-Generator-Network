Its leaves might not be green, but its potential for energy efficiency most certainly is.

This little mock bonsai tree might look like the kind of thing that just sits prettily on top of a coffee table - but it is actually a rather ornate phone charger.

Ornate: This mock Bonsai tree is in fact a solar-powered charger for everyday electrical devices called the Electree+

The device has 27 miniature silicon solar panels - or 'leaves', as they are called - that can be arranged in any way the owner wants to create their own bespoke tree.

The base of the gadget conceals a battery that stores the solar energy.

At full capacity it can hold enough power to charge an iPad twice and can charge a phone in just four hours.

But while the gadget may cut down on your energy bills, it might take you a while to recoup the savings, as it will costs Â£283.
