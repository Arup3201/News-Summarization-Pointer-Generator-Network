Calm, relaxed and assured, it is hard to believe that less than three years ago Danny Care was in danger of squandering his career. A string of alcohol-related offences culminated in the gifted young Harlequin being banished from England’s squad by Stuart Lancaster, fined £10,000 by his club and banned from driving for 16 months.

It was a grim time as English rugby’s World Cup hangover showed no sign of clearing.

In many ways, Care’s actions made the situation worse and Lancaster’s no-nonsense decision to remove his former charge from the squad proved the first decisive step in instilling discipline and core values in a team who had lost their way.

This week, Care could barely contain his joy as he spoke about his son, Blake, at England’s Pennyhill Park base. Reintegrated, refreshed and bursting with paternal pride, Care epitomises the journey that has seen the England squad reinvent themselves under Lancaster.

Next Saturday the 27-year-old will take on the world champion All Blacks at Twickenham — almost certainly as England’s starting No 9 — knowing just how close he came to blowing it.

‘Everyone’s got their own story and everyone goes through good and bad times,’ he said. ‘It’s part of life. It’s part of growing up. I wouldn’t change what happened to me now. I think it made me the player and person I am today. I’ve learnt from those experiences. I went back and worked on my game and took it a lot more seriously.

Care was frustrated when he was dropped from the England squad - he clearly loves being a part of the team

‘Any player who doesn’t get picked for a squad, through his own wrong-doing or others playing well, you always question “how am I going to get back in?” But the coaches, especially Stuart, made it very clear that if I got my rugby talking again and did my stuff on the pitch then the door wasn’t shut at all.

‘He just got frustrated saying “I know your potential and you’re not fulfilling it at the moment”. It was a bit of an eye-opener not getting picked. To not be picked for your country for your own wrong-doing is a horrible feeling. I’ll never let it happen again.’

Everything about his response to being dropped indicated the Leeds Academy graduate was ready to get serious.

Lancaster’s decision to discipline Care, who he had coached since he was a schoolboy while becoming friends with his parents, sent a long overdue shot across the player’s bows. It marked the start of the rebuilding process. Slowly, England started to re-engage with a public who had utterly lost trust following the dwarf-tossing hedonism of New Zealand 2011.

‘I’ve known Stuart since I was 14 or 15 and I’m still as scared of him now as I was back then,’ Care said. ‘He still gives you that look when he’s not happy. He’s a coach who you want to play for. I learnt pretty quickly what was unacceptable and what was not.

‘Stuart believes in all these values, about what being an England rugby player means, the number of people we’re representing — people who have worn the shirt before, the people who will wear it in the future. We owe it to them to do it justice.

‘He strips you right back to the people we’re playing for. He mentioned a 17-year-old lad who came to see us last year and unfortunately lost his life through cancer. He came to train, met all the players, we sent him off a shirt. And apparently to his last couple of days, it was one of the best experiences he’d ever had.

‘If we can try and help people like that and inspire people like that, we’re doing all right. We want to play for the whole country, we want to give them a smile, and give them a team to really follow and feel a part of.’

Next week Care and his team-mates face the ultimate challenge. Beaten three times by Steve Hansen’s men last summer — at the end of another abysmally scheduled season which saw the Aviva Premiership final played three weeks before the first Test in Auckland — Lancaster’s men have much to do to convince the public they are serious World Cup contenders. But convince them they can, and a performance anywhere near the one which saw them dispatch the same opposition 38-21 at Twickenham two years ago will send expectation levels soaring ahead of next year’s tournament.

Care has become a pivotal part of Stuart Lancaster's England set-up

‘When you look at international sport in general, whether it is football, cricket, rugby or whatever, the All Blacks are right up there as one of the best,’ Lancaster said.

‘I was looking at the German football team since the World Cup. What has been most impressive about the All Blacks is that, after winning the World Cup, sometimes you can subconsciously get a little bit, not complacent, but take your eye off the ball — the Germans have lost a couple of games recently — but the All Blacks kept on winning.’

He added: ‘It is a phenomenal record and it is not like the competition they are playing against is all Tier One nations and they win home and away. Having said that, while we respect them, we have to make sure we create our own belief that we can do that and we know we can do it. We have beaten them and pushed them close as well.’

Lancaster will name his team on Tuesday (TBC), with Care expected to partner Owen Farrell at half-back with Brad Barritt and Kyle Eastmond in the midfield. With Mike Brown set to start at full-back and the pack almost picking itself, the wing positions are hardest to call.

Marland Yarde has been in poor form for his new club, Harlequins, in recent weeks, while Jack Nowell is short of match fitness, Jonny May is yet to convince on the highest stage, and Semesa Rokoduguni is uncapped and untested. Selecting Bath’s Fijian-born winger would be the bravest pick of all.

But whatever the outcome next week, Care will go home as a happy man to his partner Josie and month-old son. After plumbing the depths of despair when a toe injury kept him out of the 2011 World Cup —which proved a blessing in disguise in retrospect — the reformed lad from Leeds has learned the meaning of perspective.

‘Missing the last World Cup was brutal,’ he said. ‘Picking up an innocuous injury a couple of weeks before was incredibly hard to take.

‘All you dream about as a kid is to represent your country in the World Cup and to miss it that close was hard to swallow, but it made me even more hungry to try to play in a home World Cup.

‘But being a dad puts a lot of things into perspective and makes you suddenly grow up. For the first in my life I’ve properly got responsibility. I’ve got someone else to look after rather than myself. It’s an unbelievable. I’ve learnt not to worry about the little things in life.’
