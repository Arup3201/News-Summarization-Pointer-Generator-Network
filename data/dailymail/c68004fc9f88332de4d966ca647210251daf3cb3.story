The Jets fan who was caught on camera punching a woman in the face after Sunday's game against the Patriots has been revealed as an ex-con who served three years in prison for the stabbing death of a 17-year-old boy.

Kurt Paschke, 38, a lifelong New York Jets fan, punched a small blond woman, square in the face during a post-match brawl.

Following a furor after it was posted on social media, investigations have revealed that Paschke, then 17, was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to three years in jail for the stabbing death of Henri Ferrer during a fight outside a pizzeria in Sayville, New York in 1992.

Violent past: Paschke (right) seems to have channeled his energies into a love of all things New York Jets, but his passions overwhelmed him Sunday when he was involved in a brawl

According to the New York Post, Paschke was originally charged with murder but was convicted of the lesser crime.

'I am deeply sorry,' Paschke said at 
the time of his sentencing in 1995. 'I can honestly say I never sought 
the confrontation, but when it came, I did what I had to do.'

The father of the deceased told the New York Post that Paschke 'got off 
lightly' for the stabbing of his son because Paschke's father was a 
Suffolk County police officer.

'I wrote the judge a letter, that this guy is going to kill again,' Robert Ferrer, 80, told the New York Post.

'He killed for no reason. He went out
 of his way to get a knife to stab my son. My son was involved in a fist
 fight and he went out to get a knife and stabbed my son. They were the 
same age. They were the same size. He had no business killing my son.'

Angry: This blonde woman seen in the red and white jersey advances towards the Jets fan

Hit: The blonde woman reels back as she is punched in the face by the large man

Friends of Paschke are quick to defend the bartender's actions on Sunday.

'He would never go after anybody if there wasn’t a reason,' said Ward Roser, 52.

'It looks like the girl went after him, not the other way around. He would never hit a lady.'

The video shows a large man wearing camouflage shorts and a Wayne Chrebet jersey being hauled away from the crowd by another man.

A blond woman, who has been identified as Patriots fan Jaclyn Nugent by the New York Post, advances towards him then reels back as she is punched squarely in the nose.

The woman seems relatively unperturbed for someone who has just been punched by a man twice her size.

She nonchalantly wipes her nose with her arm as the man who punched her is pulled away.

Two law enforcement sources told NBC 4 New York that they expect charges against Paschke to be announced Tuesday.

It's
 unclear what started the brawl, but a new rule that helped the Jets 
clinch the victory may have had something to do with it.

According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation.

The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick. 

After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick

A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We
 are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior. 
Parties involved were detained, and this matter is now in the hands of 
the New Jersey State Police.'

Hard hit: The force of the punch sends her staggering several feet backward

The New York Daily News spoke to Paschke's mother, who says her son punched Nugent to protect her.

Colleen Paschke was at the game with her son and daughter on Sunday, in which the Jets bested the Patriots 30-27.

'He’s the victim, really,' she told the New York Daily News from her home.

'He was just concerned for his mother and himself.'

Colleen Paschke says that from the beginning of the game she and her children were heckled by a group of Patriots fans.

Those same fans, of whom Nugent was one, allegedly set upon the Paschkes as they were leaving the stadium.

'He was just hitting back to defend himself,' she said. 'It wasn't done deliberately. If you see the video, they just went wild.'

Colleen Paschke told the Daily News that when Nugent left, she flicked blood - blood drawn by Kurt Paschke - at her.

Paschke's Facebook page features pictures of his beloved Jets-themed van, named the Jets Mobile, and and, interestingly, an anti-bullying slogan.

The court of public opinion, however, seems to be weighed heavily against Paschke.

'Leave it to a Jets fan to punch a chick in the face after a game,' wrote one. 'You guys can’t handle a win?'

'The Jets exemplify dignity and class #saidNoOne,' tweeted another.

As of Monday evening, Paschke has not been charged with a crime. The New Jersey Police Department is investigating the incident.
