James Bond actor Daniel Craig has brought Manhattan to a standstill as he launched the brand new Range Rover Sport by driving it to a star-studded reception through the streets of New York.

The 007 star took a spectacular spin in the new British-built luxury 4X4 as number of roads in the Big Apple - Land Rover’s biggest market - were specially sealed off.

Cameras broadcast live coverage of the action-packed event online and on giant screens at the Skylight at Moynihan Station on 8th Avenue where the vehicle was officially revealed to the world.

Scroll down to watch Craig driving through NYC...

Star power: Daniel Craig personally drove the all-new Range Rover Sport to its unveiling in New York City

Shaken, not stirred: The British car-maker exports many of its vehicles to the U.S. and can now count on a home-grown Hollywood A-lister like Daniel Craig to sell even more

Sleek: New York is already land Rover's biggest metropolitan market and the U.S. its best-selling country

Good company: Daniel Craig poses with S.A.F.E. founder, Nick Reding, in front of the all-new Range Rover Sport

The real-life driving stunt formed the climax of a pre-shot Hollywood mini-movie which charted the new car's journey from the factory where it was built in Solihull in the West Midlands to the docks of New York where Craig is seen picking it up and driving to the launch party.

The dynamic drama in the sporty off-roader took place on the eve of the New York Motor Show.

It was reminiscent of the clip in which Craig - as 007 - and Queen Elizabeth kick-started the London 2012 Olympics this summer.

‘I’ve done plenty of it in movies and we’ve closed stretches off.  But a live event? You suddenly think: do I know how to drive? Can I do this?’

He said of Land Rover : ‘We’ve had a connection with them at Bond for a number of years. And they have been very generous with their cars.

If you look at the Bonds I’ve been involved in, you will notice there are a lot of Range Rovers and Land Rovers.’

Bonding: Daniel Craig drives the new Range Rover Sport up Eighth Avenue in Manhattan 

State of the art: The all-new Range Rover Sport, revealed to the world today on the streets of New York, is the ultimate premium sports SUV - the fastest, most agile and responsive Land Rover ever

Driving: After his adventure on the streets on New York, Craig delivered the luxury 4X4 to a packed crowd of guests including Zara Phillips, and models Jade Jagger and Yasmin Le Bon

Sports stars: Former NFL player Michael Strahan and New York Red Bulls star Thierry Henry were also on hand at the unveiling of the new car

Of his spin around the city he said 
for safety he could not exploit  the car’s performance  to the limit 
during the event: ’I’d like  to push it a little. I had fun. I’d like to
have a bit more fun in it.
‘It doesn’t feel aggressive but  you feel it wants to go. I’d like to throw it around a bit and see what it will do.’

He was also please that Land Rover 
had donated two of its vehicles Kenyan charity  S.A.F.E. set up and  run
by his friend Nick Reding.

It is a major coup for the British 
car-maker which exports many of its vehicles to the USA and can now 
count on a home-grown Hollywood A-lister to sell even more.

The
Skylight event took place in part of the historic James A. Farley Post 
Office, whose Beaux-Arts exterior contrasts sharply with the venue's 
stark industrial interior.

The new Range Rover Sport – the sportier 'baby brother' of the bigger Range Rover - goes on sale in September priced from $83,358. It will  ultimately be introduced in 169 markets worldwide. 

New York is already land Rover’s biggest metropolitan market and the U.S. its best-selling country.

Last year nearly 50,000 Land Rovers out of the 304,000 sold worldwide were bought in North America.

And Craig is no stranger to the vehicles.

Ahead of his appearance in Skyfall, he already had experience in Land Rovers and Jaguars at the company’s secret proving ground at Gaydon in Warwickshire at the heart of Shakespeare country.

The car firm say the all-new Range Rover Sport is 'the fastest, most agile and technology-packed Land Rover ever.'

After his driving adventure on the streets on New York, Craig delivered the luxury 4X4 to a packed crowd of guests including Zara Phillips, rapper Waka Flocka Jade Jagger and Simon and Yasmin Le Bon.

The was filmed as part of a short mini-movie entitled 'The Delivery' which was broadcast live by Land Rover at NewRangeRoverSport.com.

The movie was directed by acclaimed Hollywood director Jonathan PB Taylor who has worked on The Fast & the Furious, the Spider-Man films, Captain America: The First Avenger and most recently, Die Hard.

A Land Rover spokesman said: 'The film tells the story of a driver tasked with delivering a top secret package.

'Starting at the Land Rover manufacturing plant in Solihull, UK, the car is shipped under the cover of darkness in a large container over to Manhattan.

'It is then unveiled and driven expertly through the streets of the city, over Manhattan Bridge and through a closed off tunnel, in a bid by its driver, Daniel Craig, to get it to the launch venue on time.'

Craig said he was attracted to working with Land Rover because of his love for the British brand and its work with the UK-Kenya-based charity S.A.F.E, which uses the performing arts and community programs to better people's lives.

Land Rover's global brand director John Edwards said: 'The all-new Range Rover Sport is an extraordinary car and we have revealed it in an extraordinary way - live on the streets of its biggest selling market. 

'It turned heads and it stopped traffic in one of the world’s most dynamic cities in the world.'

He added: ‘It  represents a step change in engineering and technology. It is almost half a ton lighter resulting in significant CO2 savings and its faster, more agile and more dynamic than ever.'

Craig is already familiar with the bigger Range Rover after arriving in one at the Skyfall premiere at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

In October, MailOnline revealed exclusively how by stealth and low-key guile expected of a super-spy, he effectively launched in Britain the brand new fourth generation Range Rover when he was chauffeured in it to the red carpet Skyfall premiere.

A Land Rover Defender also has a starring role in the film.

The car-maker said: ‘Those tuning into the live broadcast will be treated to 'the best seats in the house' and be able to select a range of camera angles and viewing points from which to watch the reveal.'

Meanwhile, Jaguar is launching two new leaping 'cats' in New York.

It is unveiling its new flagship XJR whose 550 horse-power 5.0litre V8 engine propels it from rest to 60mph in just 4.4 seconds with its top speed limited electronically to 174mph.

The covers are also coming off the super-hot 'track-ready' XKR-S GT  which will hit 60mph in just 3.9 seconds and reach a top speed electronically limited to 186mph.
