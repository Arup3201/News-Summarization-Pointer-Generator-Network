Campaign leader: Army officer Jessica Scott, 35, is responsible for starting the 'I am not a slut' hashtag on Twitter following Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments about contraception

When Rush Limbaugh called a college student a 'slut' over a heated debate on contraception it sparked a national outcry.

The controversial radio host found himself abandoned by advertisers and was even criticised by Barack Obama.

But it was an online campaign through Twitter which really helped to galvanize women's outrage over his comments.

The hashtag 'I am not a slut' went viral and resulted in hundreds of tweets in an enormous national reaction against Mr Limbaugh.

And it has now emerged that the woman responsible for starting the online campaign is a 35-year-old Army officer from Fort Hood, Texas.

Jessica Scott, who is a company commander and romance novelist, told BuzzFeed that she had been following the heated debates on contraception and religious liberty for a month.

But when Mr Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers' contraception, she decided it was time to act.

The second lieutenant, who has served in Iraq, wrote on Twitter that she 'used birth control while deployed with my husband so I *wouldn't* get pregnant & sent home.'

She then finished the tweet with the hashtag #iamnotaslut which proved hugely popular and sparked a flurry of tweets expressing anger at Mr Limbaugh's comments.

Speaking to BuzzFeed, Mrs Scott, who has two children, said: 'The entire thing is absolutely appalling because her testimony wasn't even about sex.

'It was about a woman who'd lost an ovary because her insurance would not cover birth control pills she needed to control the ovarian cysts.'

Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their employees.

But instead he dialed up the rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke, from Catholic College Georgetown University in Washington D.C, should film herself having sex and then claiming that she 'had boyfriends lined up around the block'.

However, after a number of firms pulled their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday afternoon, three days after his initial remarks. 

Today, AOL became the eighth advertiser to drop their adverts from Mr Limbaugh's show.

The company posted on Twitter today: 'At AOL one of our core values is that we act with integrity. We have monitored the unfolding events and have determined that Mr. Limbaugh’s comments are not in line with our values. As a result we have made the decision to suspend advertising on The Rush Limbaugh Radio show'.

His apology read: 'For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.'

Mrs Scott, who has served in the army for 17 years, was left stunned by the reaction her hashtag created

When she is not working as a soldier, she writes romance novels with covers featuring near-naked male soldiers.

Her books - part of a series called Coming Home - focus on soldiers returning from war.

But despite not seeking a role as an activist, she has not backed down either.

She says birth control allows her to live the life she wants because she has control over when she can have children.

Mrs Scott, whose husband has been deployed to Iraq four times, also said: 'It's incredibly frustrating to know that in 2012, we are still fighting over the basic right of women to be full members of society and not be valued solely for the fruit of their womb.'

Mr Obama said he considered Mr Limbaugh's remarks 'reprehensible' and called Ms Fluke to express his disappointment that she was the subject of 'inappropriate personal attacks'.

Ms Fluke said on Friday that she has been left 'very upset' by the comments made by Mr Limbaugh.

'My
reaction was the reaction a lot of women have had historically when 
they’ve been called these types of names,' she told MSNBC. 'Initially to
be stunned by it, and then to quickly feel outraged and very upset.'

Following his apology, Mr Limbaugh went on to argue that 'personal sexual recreational activities' should not enter the public sphere, as this undermines notions of 'personal responsibility and accountability'.

Mr Limbaugh concluded: 'In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

'My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologise to Ms Fluke for the insulting word choices.'

Shock: Ms Fluke told MSNBC's Today show on Friday that she 
was 'stunned and outraged' by the comments

Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on 
Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers 
provide contraception.

But committee chairman Darrell Issa of 
California said she could not testify at the hearing as it was focused on 
threats to religious freedom.

Ms Fluke later put her testimony on YouTube 
and spoke about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a disorder that 
caused ovarian cysts.

The friend subsequently lost her ovary. She 
also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception.

Female rights activists were left seething and 
two Democrats walked out of the Capitol Hill hearing last month after it was led 
by an all-male panel.

Ms Fluke did eventually speak about birth 
control at a Democratic hearing led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, reported ABC News.
