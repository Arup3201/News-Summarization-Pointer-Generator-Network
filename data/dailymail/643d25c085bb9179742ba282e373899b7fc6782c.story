Lib Dem minister Lynne Featherstone said women taking a break to have children allow men to climb the ladder faster

The fact women ‘still have babies’ is to blame for the lack of gender equality in Britain today, according to a Lib Dem minister.

Lynne Featherstone, an international development minister who was in charge of equalities until September’s reshuffle, said childbirth was a ‘barrier’ to women’s career success.

She said women who devoted time to bringing up children suffer a ‘setback’ because it gives ‘mediocre’ men an opportunity to leapfrog them on the corporate ladder.

Her forthright remarks come as her party leader Nick Clegg announced plans to allow men and women to share their parental leave.

But he was forced to drop more radical plans to extend paternity leave to six weeks after opposition from the Tories and business.

Maria Miller, the new equalities minister, will today announce plans for start-up grants to help people launch childcare businesses – part of a drive by the Coalition to appeal to women voters.

Miss Featherstone, 60, a single mother of two grown-up children, believes women are yet to achieve the same status as men. She said: ‘One of the main barriers to full equality in the UK is the fact women still have babies.

‘[Having a baby] is a bit of a setback to women because it gives an opportunity – whether it’s in commerce, politics or wherever you work – to men to climb the ladder faster.

‘I have seen many mediocre men on boards of directors. They get there because they had no break on the way.’

Nick Clegg, who announced major changes to parental leave, paid a visit to the 'Third Door' nursery in Putney where he played with a dinosaur

She added: ‘Women have had to fight 
every inch of the way because there aren’t the same kind of networking 
opportunities and then there is the career break if you have children – 
so women have not been present when others took their opportunities.

‘I was a single mother with two 
children. It’s really tough to manage it all. And if you are managing it
 all you feel guilty – we women still haven’t got over our own issues.’

Miss Featherstone said better and 
cheaper childcare would help resolve the issue, and that there was more 
work to do on the issue of equal pay.

The proportion of all FTSE 100 directors who are female is now 16 per cent, up 2.5 per cent in the last three years.

A group of Tory MPs is launching an 
investigation into why so few executive directors in the country’s 
biggest companies are women.

The Executive Women in the Workplace 
inquiry, co-chaired by Therese Coffey and Mary Macleod, will take 
evidence from companies, investors and recruitment firms.
