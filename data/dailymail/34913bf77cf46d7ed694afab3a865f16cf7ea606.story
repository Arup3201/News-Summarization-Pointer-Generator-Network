Six water companies are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans

Some of Britain's biggest water companies are controversially using tax havens to avoid paying millions in UK tax, a new investigation claims today.

Six of them, including Northumbrian, Yorkshire and Thames, are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans.

The arrangements have emerged as water regulator OFWAT announced last week that water bills would rise by 3.5pc to an average of £388-a-year per household.

Controversial schemes taken by big firms to slash their tax bills are the centre of attention at the moment after MPs slammed US giants like Google and Starbucks as 'immoral'.

The government has announced new plans to clamp down on firms who push their revenues abroad out of the grasp of the taxman. They will be prevented from winning lucrative Whitehall contracts.

Companies bidding for government contracts will have to provide details of their tax compliance history, including tax returns that have been judged incorrect, under the draft new rules announced yesterday.

Proposals to change the law come as water firms Northumbria, Yorkshire, Anglian, Thames, South Staffordshire and Sutton and East Surrey were thrust into the spotlight over their tax affairs.

An investigation by lobby group Corporate Watch shows all have taken big loans from investors which they are allowed to offset against their profits – the figure over which corporation tax is calculated.

While we already knew firms reduced their tax bill by doing this we did not know that they had also found a way to avoid paying tax on the interest payments made on these loans.

Normally when a UK company pays interest to a non-UK company it has to withhold 20pc of the payments and give it to the taxman.

But investors in the water companies have found a way round this by using a complex tax scheme.

They issued their loans through the Channel Islands stock exchange as something called 'quoted Eurobonds' which means they do not have to pay the tax on the interest due to a loophole.

Thames Water, which is based in Reading, Berkshire, confirmed the interest payments on its £310million of quoted Eurobonds from its owners are tax-deductible

Corporate Watch has found some of the £1billion in loans made to Northumbrian Water, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, were listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange.

It paid £50million in interest on this for six month in 2011/12 and is due to pay £100million for the following year, Corporate Watch says. This means it has saved paying the UK Government £30million in tax on the interest.

It declined to comment.

Yorkshire Water, which is owned by investment funds based in the US, UK and Singapore and HSBC, accrued £66million in interest payments on £844million of quoted Eurobonds in 2012, Corporate Watch says.

This, together with the interest payments on its other debt, helped it pay just £100,000 in corporation tax on an operating profit of £335million in 2012. It declined to comment.

Thames Water, which is part owned by Australia's Macquarie group, nicknamed the 'Millionaire Factory' for its huge payouts to shareholders, confirmed the interest payments on its £310million of quoted Eurobonds from its owners are tax-deductible.

Combined with its other debt, these helped the company wipe out an operating profit of £577million, meaning it received a tax credit in 2012.

It said: 'Our operational performance. . . is better than ever. This is the result of higher-than-ever levels of investment. Meanwhile our customers' bills remain the second-lowest in the country.'

It was a similar story at Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey and South Staffordshire Water who all declined to comment.
