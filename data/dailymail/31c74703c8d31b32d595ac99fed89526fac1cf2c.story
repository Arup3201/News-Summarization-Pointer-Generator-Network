Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed his support for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) once again by displaying the words '805 million names' on his boots during Paris Saint-Germain's 1-1 draw against Chelsea.

The Sweden international took to Twitter shortly before his side's Champions League encounter against the Blues to reveal what he had penned on to his footwear.

His gesture comes just days after he announced why he had 50 names tattooed on to his upper body.

The 33-year-old had the names temporarily inked on to his body to pay tribute to the WFP, who aim to help the 805 million people who are suffering from hunger.

Ibrahimovic said of his gesture: 'Wherever I go people recognise me, call my name, cheer for me.

'But there are names no one cares to remember. That no one cheers for: the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world today.

'I have the supporters all over the world. From now on I want this support to go to the people who suffer from hunger, they are the real champions.

'So whenever you hear my name, you will think of their names.'

Ibrahimovic had the temporary tattoos - of names such as Carmen, Mariko, Antoine, Lida, Rahma and Yaae - applied to his torso ahead of the Caen match.

The PSG ace revealed the 50 names when he stripped off during his side's 2-2 draw with Caen on Saturday.

Ibrahimovic, who was warned by Laurent Blanc about taking his shirt off against Chelsea, celebrated by showing his support to the WFP after scoring in the second minute.

Blanc said: 'Imagine if he'd got another yellow card after 20 minutes? We may as well have abandoned the game in the 70th minute because we would have been down to seven men.

'It was a good initiative, but I don't know whether him taking his shirt off was good for us. I hope that, on Tuesday, if he scores he doesn't take the shirt off because he will be booked again.' 

Ibrahimovic removed his shirt to reveal the 50 names after scoring after just 72 seconds of the match

Ibrahimovic wore most of the tattoos on his arm, chest and midriff 

The striker was booked for removing his shirt in celebration, as the laws of the game dictate
