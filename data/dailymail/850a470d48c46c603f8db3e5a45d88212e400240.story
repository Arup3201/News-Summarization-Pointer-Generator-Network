Determined: Keira Knightley won the battle against dyslexia with hard work

Actress Keira Knightley has revealed that she tried a popular technique to help her overcome dyslexia as a child – but found the old-fashioned method of perseverance worked far better.

‘I had tutors for years and I used coloured plastic sheets to put over the text which helps some people but didn’t really help me,’ says the star.

For Keira, 29, overcoming the obstacles of dyslexia – a learning disability that affects mainly reading and writing – came down to simple hard graft.

‘A lot of it is down to perseverance and hopefully you’ll have parents who will work hard with you, because that’s what mine did. I still have days where reading just won’t work but most days it will.

‘I don’t think it’s something that ever fully goes away. Sight-reading is a problem – I can read text on the page but if I have to read it aloud, it might be a problem. That doesn’t come easily.’

Keira, has said her mother helped her by making her recite Emma Thompson’s Oscar-winning screenplay for Sense And Sensibility aloud.

A new machine that enables doctors to tell within hours whether cancer drugs are working is being trialled in Britain.

It could save the lives of those who are not responding to drugs by switching them to more effective treatment.

‘The standard method for assessing if a treatment has worked is for a patient to take a course and then determine whether or not the tumour has shrunk,’ says Professor Kevin Brindle at Cambridge University. ‘This could allow doctors to tell much more quickly whether a treatment is working.’

GE Healthcare’s SpinLab machine works by making visible glucose molecules – that MRI scanners have not been able  to detect – which show the molecular changes of cells, indicating whether a drug is working on a tumour. Those with lymphoma, breast cancer and glioma – a type of brain tumour – are most suitable for the trial.

Putting on weight may increase the 
risk of dementia – and the damage may be done early in life. Increasing 
levels of fat can lead to a shrinking of grey matter, according to 
researchers from the US National Institute of Ageing.

As the amounts of 
fatty tissue increase, grey matter is lost in the front lobe, an area of
 the brain involved in decision-making, problem-solving and planning.

Just how fat could have such an effect is not clear, but it is 
recognised that fat tissue produces compounds involved in inflammation. 
Dr James Pickett, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Maintaining a 
healthy weight can play a role in reducing the risk of developing 
dementia.’

High life: The View From The Shard are about to offer weekly yoga programme set to run for eight weeks

If A double espresso won’t wake you up first thing in the morning, then yoga, 800ft above London, will.

Now you can do a downward dog and a bit of sightseeing  at the same time thanks to a new programme of weekly yoga sessions at The View From The The Shard, in Britain’s tallest skyscraper.

The classes will run for eight weeks. In fine weather, it will take place in the open air just beneath the shards of glass that top the building, for the ultimate zen thrill.

A new migraine device that reduces symptoms in 50 per cent of sufferers is being launched in the UK. Cefaly, already available in the US and Europe, reduced medication intake by almost 75 per cent in clinical trials. The £295 device comes as an electrode worn on a headband across the forehead. This delivers a micro-current to the trigeminal nerve, which is involved in most migraines and whose main branch ends at the top of the eye socket. Stimulating the nerve has a relaxing effect. Used for 20 minutes a day, it takes up to six weeks to start kicking in.

Grumpy old men (and women) take note: complaining can have a negative impact on your partner’s health. A new study has shown that the spouses of optimists are likely to live longer than those hitched to pessimists.

Not only did optimists have fewer chronic diseases, so too did their partners. In stressful situations, optimists cope by using planning strategies, which may explain why they are more likely to fight off disease.

Optimism has also been linked with  healthier levels of immune system cells and antioxidants. The researchers tracked 2,000 couples aged 50 and over, measuring health.
