Spot the dog is the challenge being laid down by the pet owner behind these Where's Wally-style photographs.

Andrew Knapp is hoping eagle-eyed viewers will have lots of fun finding Momo - his black and white border collie concealed within the images.

The graphic designer originally produced the series of pictures as a gift for  his nieces and nephews.

Finding Momo: Andrew Knapp created a series of photographs with his dog Momo concealed within the scenes

Challenge: Eagle-eyed viewers have to look hard at each image to pick out the camouflaged border collie

Spot the dog: Momo's black and white fur coat helps him blend into Ontario's snowy scenery

Hidden: Momo posed for his owner, who has made him blend seamlessly into the background

But the 30-year-old believes they have mass appeal and is now turning the collection into a book.

The photographs are of various locations around Mr Knapp's snow-covered hometown of Sudbury in Ontario Canada.

The dog lover managed to get Momo to pose in each scene, using the colour of his fur and natural light to help him blend into the scenery.

The canine showed great patience and obedience to sit still long enough for his owner to capture the perfect shot.

Gift: Graphic designer Andrew Kanpp originally created the photographs as a present for relatives

Hometown: Mr Knapp took the photographs at various locations around Sudbury in Ontario, Canada

Pin point: The images are reminiscent of the popular chidlren's books Where's Wally?

Mass appeal: Mr Knapp is hoping the images will be a big hit as he turns his collection into a book

In one of the pictures, Momo is hidden 
somewhere around a pile of black bin bags dumped on a mound of snow, and
in another he is concealed near a snow-covered hockey pitch.

Other locations include the beach, a snowy clearing among woodland and a three-storey detached house.

The lack of snow in some of the photographs does not make it any easier to spot the adorable dog.

The images are reminiscent of Where's Wally?, a popular series of books in which readers have to pin point the title character who is among a busy crowd.

Where's Momo? Can you spot the border collie hiding among these filing cabinets?

Heel: Less snow and more colours does not make the black and white pooch any easier to spot

Here boy: The canine has shown great patience and obedience to pose for his owner's picture project

Life's a beach: A trip to the seaside also provided a location to baffle viewers searching for Momo

Wally may be recognisable in his red-and-white jumper, glasses and bobble hat but he can take some finding within the bustling illustration.

The series was created by Martin Handford for Walker Books in the 1980s and has been translated into around 30 different languages.

It has also spawned a television show and video game, while a film based on the character is being developed.

Crafty canine: A dog using a sofa as camouflage rather than chewing it to pieces makes a refreshing change

Home sweet home: A three-storey detached house provided plenty of hiding spaces for Momo

Winter woodland: A clearing in the woods does not necessarily mean a clear sighting of the border collie

Hard to find: Wally may be very recognisable, but not when he is concealed among a busy crowd
