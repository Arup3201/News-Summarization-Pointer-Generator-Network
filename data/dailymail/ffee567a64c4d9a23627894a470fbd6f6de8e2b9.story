Portraits of famous Confederate generals Robert Lee and Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson could soon be removed from the walls of the U.S. Army War College in Pennsylvania, where senior military leaders go to study.

An inventory of the paintings and photographs at the college has prompted a debate about how appropriate it is for the college to honor men who fought against the United States and in favor of slavery. 

‘I do know at least one person has questioned why we would honor individuals who were enemies of the United States Army,’ college spokeswoman Carol Kerr said.

She confirmed to the Washington Post that one faculty member had taken down the portraits of Lee and Jackson as part of the inventory process and placed them on the ground.

This had given rise to rumors that the paintings were being removed, although they have in fact been rehung in a third-floor hallway. 

‘[Lee] was certainly not good for the nation. This is the guy we faced on the battlefield whose entire purpose in life was to destroy the nation as it was then conceived. … This is all part of an informed discussion,’ she said.

The outcome of that debate could spark change for portraits in other military installations and government buildings.

Opened in 1901, the United States Army War College is a United States Army institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on the 500 acre (2 km²) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks.

It provides graduate level instruction to senior military officers and civilians to prepare them for senior leadership assignments and responsibilities. Each year, a number of Army colonels and lieutenant colonels are considered by a board for admission.

Approximately 800 students attend at any one time, half in a two-year-long distance learning program, and the other half in an on-campus full-time resident program lasting ten months. Upon completion, the college grants its graduates a master's degree in Strategic Studies.

General Jackson's death in 1863 was seen as a major blow for 
the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the
 morale of its army and of the general public.

In death he became 
an icon of Southern heroism and commitment, joining Lee in the pantheon 
of the 'Lost Cause'.

Still
 regarded as one of U.S. history's greatest tacticians, historians still
 debate whether the outcome of the whole Civil War might have been 
altered if he had survived.

His Valley Campaign and his 
envelopment of the Union Army right wing at Chancellorsville are studied
 worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership.

He excelled as well in other battles;
 the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) where he received his 
famous nickname 'Stonewall', Second Bull Run (Second Manassas), 
Antietam, and Fredericksburg.

Jackson was not universally successful
 as a commander, however, as displayed by his weak and confused efforts 
during the Seven Days Battles around Richmond in 1862.

He
 was greatly admired and respected throughout the South, and his death 
had a profound effect there on civilians and soldiers alike.

A poem penned by one of his soldiers soon became a very popular song, 'Stonewall Jackson's Way'.

On learning of his injuries, General Lee wrote to Jackson stating: 'Could I have directed events, I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead.'
