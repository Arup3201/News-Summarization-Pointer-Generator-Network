The aunt of a 13-year-old girl critically injured in the Roswell middle school shooting has hit out at members of the community for basking in the media attention the gun attack has brought to their city.

Police yesterday identified 13-year-old Kendal Sanders as one of two victims of the attack on Berrendo Middle School.

The innocent teen was blasted in the shoulder when the shooter, named in local reports as 12-year-old Mason Campbell, opened fire on the school gymnasium at 7.30am on Tuesday.

Victim: Kendal Sanders, 13, was one of two students shot at Berrendo Middle School

Happy teen: Kendal looks like an happy 13-year-old teenager on Facebook. She was shot in the shoulder and has had to undergo emergency surgery

Close family: Kendal regularly post pictures with her father Bert and mother Betty online. Her aunt Lisa described how her father broke down on hearing the news and remains at his daughter's bedside

Kendal's devastated family have since taken to social media to ask for prayers and to detail what happened.

One aunt, Lisa Sanders, also took the opportunity to hit out at members of the community boasting about the fact they've appeared in one of the many broadcasts from the school beamed around the country - and the world.

In an angry post on Facebook on Tuesday night, she called on people to remember the families of the two victims in the shooting.

'I hope everyone who is "happy" to be on TV understands exactly what is going on!' she wrote just hours after joining Kendal's parents Bert and Betty at the Lubbock hospital where Kendal is being treated.

'As the little girl's aunt who was shot today and to watch her mother and father go through every parents nightmare! I also want you to know when you see a grown man cry for his son and daughter, keep that on you mind when you are all happy about talking to reporters! From the aunt of our baby girl!'

Shooter: Local reports identified the shooter as 12-year-old Mason Campbell

Saving lives: Hero social studies teacher John Masterson talked the Roswell school shooter down after he left a 13-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy in critical condition

Community in mourning: Heartbreaking images emerged from a prayer vigil in Roswell last night as the young students of Berrendo Middle School gathered with their families

Devastated: Troy Tucker held his two daughters Emily, 10, and Hannah, 12, close at the vigil. Police say more students could have been shot if a hero teacher hadn't stepped in

Shocked: Kimberly Macias cries alongside her school friends, pictured, the teens were trying to come to terms with the devastating shooting today

She also detailed the horror injuries suffered by Kendal in the attack. Responding to well-wishers she said the teen would be in hospital for at least a week and had to undergo emergency surgery following the shooting 'cutting her from chest to waist'.

The 13-year-old's condition has improved overnight from critical to serious though.

On her own Facebook profile Kendal looks like any other 13-year-old girl posting about One Direction and popular TV shows.

She is also clearly close to her parents posting pictures with both her mom and dad happily posing for the camera.

Police are still seeking a motive for the shooting.

Campbell's other victim, an unnamed 11-year-old boy, is in critical condition. He reportedly told nurses he believed he was the intended target of the attack.

It has also emerged that the preteen shooter warned his friends to stay away from school.

Police revealed in a press conference on Tuesday night that some were told to stay away, it is not clear if any of these students raised the alarm.

'We have preliminary information that possibly some of the students were warned by the individual prior to the shooting not to go to school,' said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas.

Many more children could have been hurt in the shooting if it wasn't for the actions of a selfless social studies teacher who threw himself in front of the gunman and convinced him to put down his 20-gauge, sawed-off shotgun.

'Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ...who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,'Â New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez said at a vigil Tuesday evening, according to CNN, 'and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt.'

Mr Masterson has been a teacher for ten years and also coaches soccer at the school.

He told the Albuquerque Journal he has been warned not to speak at length about the shooting.

'It was a harrowing experience. All I can say was the staff there did a great job,' he said.

Another teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene.

Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody.

At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30am.

'(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said.

Witnesses said the 11-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this.

Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground.

He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials.

'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said.

Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone.

Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all.

'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.'

Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area.

Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot.

'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said.

Relief: Kathy Sigala cries as she hugs 11-year-old Zippy and 12-year-old Jade. 'I just want to take them home and love the,' she said

Shooter: No information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been released

She said the security guard ran to help the injured student, and school officials ordered all the students to their classrooms.

It was earlier reported that there were 
at least four victims, but the injured kids appeared to have been counted twice.

lot, waiting to be united with their kids.

One parent is seen falling to
 his knees as the situation 
clearly becomes too much while others embraced their children, overcome with relief.

A prayer vigil was held on Tuesday evening. Emotional images emerged of parents trying to console their young children devastated by what they witnessed and the injuries suffered by their school friends.
