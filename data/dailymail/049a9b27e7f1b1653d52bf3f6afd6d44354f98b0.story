It was her first UK festival of the year, and  Beyoncé made sure she hit the headlines for more than one reason.

The global icon, whose new blonde bob made its debut at V Festival, definitely entertained the crowds but unfortunately not Channel 4 viewers.

The 31-year-old singer sparked controversy by reportedly refusing to allow the broadcast company the rights to film her performance.

Presenters of this year's two-day event, Edith Bowman and Steve Jones referred to the news on air that Beyonce had declined them clearance to show her headline set.

She also appeared on stage 30 minutes late, prompting boos from the crowd who were sick of waiting for the headliners.

However, once she appeared on stage, they quickly forgave the superstar as she put on a stellar performance.

But it wasn't the only news people were talking about as she stormed the headline stage with a blonde blob after a surprise pixie cut, which the superstar informed the world about on her Instagram page.

It made headlines and according to reports, even surprised her hairstylist.

'Changing
hair is like changing lipstick or eye shadow for her,' a Beyonce pal 
told the Daily Beast. 'I think she gets a kick out of how much the press
talks about it.’'

Despite a dramatic hair makeover, Beyoncé's on stage style certainly hasn't changed.

The Queen of Pop stole the show as she headlined V Festival on Saturday, dazzling the crowd in a number of racy ensembles.

She wore her new bob sleek and straight as she bounded around the stage in a white leotard, before changing into a black one, while the excited crowd screamed her name.

The mother-of-one gave her usual high energy performance as she treated the sea of fans to her best known hits during her headline set.

And the star, who unveiled her newly chopped locks last week, proved that no one does on-stage style like she does in a number of show-stopping ensembles.

With her troupe of dancers behind her the star looked in high spirits as she strutted around in the revealing black outfit.

The revealing outfit had large,

of material attached to the waistband.

Clearly
pleased with her new haircut, Beyoncé wore it loose and perfectly 
styled, keeping her make-up light and bright to match her white outfit.

And
the star certainly didn't disappoint when it came to her performance at
Hylands Park in Essex as thousands of festival-goers turned out just to
get a glimpse of her.

Meanwhile, before her Chelmsford gig, Beyonce ordered £1,400 of Nando's chicken from the local branch.

After posting an Instagram picture of her new blonde pixie crop last week, the singer had changed it again just a week later, showing off a longer style as she stepped out in Miami on Thursday.

And while Beyoncé was on stage in the UK, her husband Jay Z was still in Miami, spotted partying with Justin Bieber at a nightclub.

She and Jay will be also hitting the stage for his Made In America festival in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania over the Labor Day holiday along with Phoenix, Nine Inch Nails and Solange Knowles.

The concert will wrap up a hectic summer for the Grammy Award-winning pair, that has seen Jay Z touring from coast to coast with JT, and Beyoncé on her Mrs. Carter Show global extravaganza.

4Music is showing Sunday's V Festival highlights on Monday night
