The body of a woman found in a San Diego park is believed to be Megadeth singer Dave Mustaine's missing mother-in-law, sheriff's deputies have said.

Deputies in Julian, San Diego County, California, responded on Wednesday to reports of a body found in heavy shrubbery on Highway 79 near Pinezanita RV Park & Campgrounds, where Sally Estabrook disappeared almost two months ago.

Mrs Estabrook, a 75-year-old with Alzheimer's disease was last seen in the park at around 4pm on October 4 wearing a teal top and white Capri pants.

Her husband told deputies at the time that he returned from a shower and found she had disappeared.

Since then, search and rescue teams from three counties and a federal agency have been searching for the missing woman. 

They were told her Alzheimer’s means she isn't very communicative, but she might respond to her name.

Deputies revealed the clothing worn by the woman whose body was found closely resembled those worn by Mrs Estabrook when she disappeared, reported NBC San Diego. 

No foul play is believed to be involved, but the cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner’s office. 

Mustaine, who formed the thrash metal band in 1983, wrote on Facebook yesterday: 'Yesterday evening I received a call that a person had located a body and the investigators from SDSD Homicide Division described our beloved mother, Sally Estabrook. 

'Thank you all for your prayers, your good thoughts, and positive vibes.'  

Mustaine posted a message on Facebook yesterday to say: 'Thank you all for your prayers, your good thoughts, and positive vibes'

When Megadeth released their most recent album, Super Collider last year, Mustaine revealed the songwriting process had been influenced by his mother-in-law's battle with Alzheimer's

He tweeted his fans in October asking them to 'please send good thoughts' to his wife Pam, 'and prayers from those of you who pray, as we search for her mom.' 

Thirty San Diego sheriff's search and rescue volunteers, including members of the Border Patrol Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit and search and rescue members from San Bernardino and Riverside searched a six mile area around the campground.

Friends and family members also assisted along with two bloodhounds and a sheriff's helicopter. 

‘It's hilly, rocky, and there are a lot of ravines,’ said sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell at the time.

‘Our fear is that she feel down a hill and maybe injured herself.’

Mustaine's daughter Electra also tweeted: 'Help find my beloved nana. She wandered off into the woods [on Saturday] @ 4pm. Has Alzheimer's-will not remember a thing!'

When Megadeth released their most recent album, Super Collider, in 2013, Mustaine revealed that the songwriting process had been influenced by his mother-in-law's battle with Alzheimer's.

According to Mustaine, the track Forget To Remember was written specifically about some experiences with memory and forgetting.

'The song touches on the no. 6 cause of death in America, Alzheimer's Disease, which my mother-in-law has been diagnosed with,' he said, 'and our world is now upside down. 

'I did what I do best when I have something to say; I sing about it.'
