Gorging on delicious treats to your heart's content for five days a week may sounds like a recipe for diet disaster.

But according to the science behind the trendy Intermittent Fasting (IF) diet as long as you starve yourself for the other two days you will actually lose weight.

Not only this but the diet craze that sounds too good to be true and is adored by super slim celebrities like Miranda Kerr claims to aid longer life and reduce risk of cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and heart disease.

Fasting two days a week and eating what you like for five is the slimline  secret favoured by Miranda Kerr

The IF eating regime  - also known as the 2:5 plan - first hailed as a wonder diet by a doctor on BBC2's Horizon is spreading like wildfire, and supermarkets are feeling the effects.

Health journalist Dr Michael Mosley followed the intermittent fasting diet in the documentary Eat, Fast And Live Longer, which was watched by more than 2.5  million people.

It's startlingly uncomplicated: there are no calculations, shakes, soups, pills or recipes to 
follow.

Simply, on two non-consecutive days in any week you consume just
 500 calories (600 for men) and on the other days eat whatever you like.

After a month on the regime Mosley lost nearly a stone, reduced his body fat by about 25 per 
cent and improved his blood sugar and cholesterol levels.

He has now released a book on the eating regime with writer Mimi Spencer, titled The Fast Diet.

Researchers have made hard-to-ignore claims about the health benefits of intermittent calorie restriction beyond weight loss, saying trials suggest it could protect against cancer, diabetes and heart disease, and neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s. In other words, it could significantly slow the ageing process.

Successful TV chef Hugh 
Fearnley-Whittingstall, presenter of Channel 4’s River Cottage series, 
has turned to the 2:5 diet to offset his Christmas ‘gluttony’ and lost 
an impressive amount of weight.

And now retailer M&S has issued impressive sales figures for its lowest calorie foods.

Selected meals in the company's calorie-controlled 'Count On Us' range are up 65%.

The 380 calorie Green Thai Curry is proving the most popular followed by the Chilli Bowl up 58 per cent (340 calories) and Meatballs up 49 per cent (340 calories.

Healthy Meals Product Developer, Elaine Kessler commented: 'We are 
continually evolving and developing our healthy meals for customers, so 
even when following a calorie controlled diet, they needn't miss out on 
flavour or taste.

'Count on Us is the perfect 
range to help people on the 5:2 diet, as it's easy to eat tasty, low 
calorie meals. We're delighted with the impact on sales, and are 
stocking up to make sure there's plenty of choice available.'

The 2:5 diet says you have to restrict to 500 calories for two days a week but you can eat what you like for five

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall feels 'lean and sharp' since embarking on the intermittent fasting diet

Type 1 diabetics, pregnant women, children and anyone suffering from an eating disorder should not fast. If you have an underlying medical condition, seek advice from a doctor before embarking on any weight-loss plan.
