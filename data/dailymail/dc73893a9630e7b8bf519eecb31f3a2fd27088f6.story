Everton are exploring the possibility of signing free agent Samuel Eto'o, meaning they could face direct competition from rivals Liverpool for the Cameroonian forward.

The 33-year-old's wage demands are an obvious stumbling block but as he is a free agent, Everton have shown an interest.

Liverpool are also considering Eto'o as they ponder short and long-term replacements fro Luis Suarez.
