Julian Ovenden, who plays Charles Blake on Downton Abbey, said his Eton education leaves him being saddled with 'posh boy' parts

His cut-glass accent may be the key to winning the heart of heiress Lady Mary.

But in real life, Downton Abbey’s latest heart-throb says being an upper-class actor is a hindrance.

Julian Ovenden, who plays Charles Blake in the ITV drama said he was always saddled with ‘posh boy’ roles because of his elite Eton education.

He added that he had to travel to the US to win roles that were not variations of Jane Austen’s romantic lead Mr Darcy.

Ovenden, 36, was three years above Prince William and actor Eddie Redmayne, both 31, at £11,090 a term Eton College. 

Other leading actors to emerge from the school include Dominic West, 44, and Homeland star Damian Lewis, 42.

Speaking at the London Festival of Cabaret, Ovenden said: ‘I don’t know if Eton has been a leap pad.

'I think you have to be aware of the situation we live in a class-conscious country.

‘I don’t assume that I am going to be cast as a Glaswegian landlord.

‘My powers of transformation don’t stretch that far so I am much more likely to be asked to play a “posh boy”.

‘But the school has produced some 
fabulous actors. And we are all very conscious of it because none of us 
want to play posh boys all the time, the reason I work in America is 
because I want to do something different, I don’t always want to play Mr
Darcy or versions of.’ 

But the actor insisted having an Eton 
schooling did not ensure success in the profession, and said he 
encountered prejudice from those who assume he is a snob because of his 
background.

The actor, who plays the part of Lady Mary Crawley's most recent love interest in the ITV drama, admitted travelling to the US in pursuit of more diverse roles

He said: ‘If you go to a school like that, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have money or certain views.

Homeland actor Damian Lewis also attended the £11,020 a term Eton College

‘It’s
very short-sighted to judge people like that, and if it was the other 
way round and we were judging people who’d gone to comprehensive school,
you wouldn’t get away with being so generalised.

'I can vouch for 
the fact that, if you go to a school like that, there’s no room for 
snobbishness though there might have been once upon a time.

‘It 
doesn’t really exist anymore - the nepotism school tie - I’m sure it 
does exist in places but in acting you do have to earn your stripes.’

In last Sunday’s episode of Downton Abbey, Mr Ovenden and widow Lady Mary - played by Michelle Dockery - appeared to be on the cusp of a new romance. In one scene, they splashed though mud together while feeding pigs at night.

In a separate interview with the Mail, the father-of-two revealed he is equally romantic in his personal life: ‘I’d say I am a very passionate person.

'When I passed my motorcycle test about six or seven years ago, my wife Kate was working in Provence doing an opera.

‘I said “I’m going to come and see you”.

‘I
did the 800 mile trip in about 12 hours - all in one go. I surprised 
her in my leathers - I was her knight in shining leathers.’

Last year, Dominic West complained his Eton education was a ‘stigma that is slightly above paedophile’.

Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch - who attended Harrow school - said he had considered moving to America permanently to avoid ‘posh bashing’.
