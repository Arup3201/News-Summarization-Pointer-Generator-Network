Changes: Planes like these landing at Gatwick Airport will be banned from landing or taking off after 11pm from 2017

The noisiest planes at Britain’s biggest airports will have to take off and land half an hour earlier under an extended night-time flying ban, the Government has revealed.

In future they will be stopped from flying in and out of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports after 11pm, 30 minutes before the current deadline.

The noisiest planes are already banned between 11.30pm and 7am at large airports and these current night flying rules will remain in place until October 2017.

Ministers say it is ‘sensible’ not to make major changes before the Government-appointed Airports Commission to report in Summer 2015 with its plans for future expansion.

‘As noise impacts are a key consideration for the commission, we agree that it would not be sensible to make any significant changes to the current regime before the commission has completed its work and the government has had time to consider its recommendations,' Aviation minister Robert Goodwill said.

‘We therefore propose to set a three year regime to last until October 2017 which will retain the main features of the current regime, in particular the numbers of movements and noise quota permitted.’

The details were published in a second consultation into night-flying, which revealed 'some minor changes will be made to restrict the noisiest aircraft.

Dangerous: Certain studies have revealed the negative impact plane noise can have on the health of households under flight paths

Named and shamed: Last week Heathrow revealed their first ever league table of airline noise based on summer readings, with Poland's LOT and Israel's El Al the worst offenders

'We are proposing to extend the 
operational ban on the noisiest types of aircraft to include the 11pm to
11.30pm  period. Such aircraft are already banned in the rest of the 
night period (11.30pm to 7am),' it says.

’Whilst there are few such movements, this change would prevent sleep disturbance caused by movements of these noisier aircraft types at this time.

‘These proposals will maintain the current level of protection for local communities, provide stability until decisions have been made about any new airport capacity.’

Ministers have also encouraged trials of planes making steeper descents into airports to reduce the noise ‘footprint’ and therefore the number of households affected.

But the report stresses: ’The Government has been restricting night flights for many years at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in order to limit the impact of night noise on local residents.’

Labour’s Shadow Aviation Minister Gordon Marsden MP said: ’I welcome the Government’s proposals not to increase the number of night time flights at these airports.

‘We believe this issue is one that the Airport Commission will want to take proper account of in both its interim and final reports. But Government must not become complacent about this issue. Instead they must carefully monitor the situation and respond to the concerns coming out of local communities while prioritising future strategies to control noise.’
