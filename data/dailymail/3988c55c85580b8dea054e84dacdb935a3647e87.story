Crystal Palace have signed former Tottenham defender Zeki Fryers for a £3million fee.

The 21-year-old has signed a three-year deal with Neil Warnock's side after passing his medical on Monday.  

Former Manchester United left-back Fryers was way down the pecking order at White Hart Lane following the arrival of Ben Davies from Swansea.

Warnock had put a new left-back at the top of his priority, with QPR's Armand Traore another contender to fill that slot.

Fryers made 16 appearances for Spurs last season after signing from Belgian club Standard Liege.  

The young defender made his debut against Dinamo Tblisi in the Europa League last August.

Sir Alex Ferguson was fuming when Fryers refused Manchester United’s contract offer and left in the summer of 2012. 

He trained with Spurs but they were unable to agree a compensation fee with United and he moved instead to Standard Liege, where he signed a two-year contract. He eventually moved to White Hart Lane in 2012.
