A Michelin-award winning chef posted an image of himself with the 'severed' head of a well-known food critic after she wrote a slightly critical review of his restaurant.

Chef Oliver Dunne posted the picture on Twitter after restaurant critic Lucinda O'Sullivan wrote the piece for the Irish Independent. 

The original picture was a promotional image released earlier this year for Dunne's restaurant Cleaver East, in Dublin, which showed the chef holding a knife and a colleague holding the head of a pig.

Controversial: Chef Oliver Dunne posted the Photoshopped image on Twitter which showed the 'severed' head of restaurant critic Lucinda O'Sullivan

But in the altered version, the pig's head was replaced with the head of Ms O'Sullivan with the caption 'Lol, look what I got in the post!'

However, the chef has since been criticised by some of his followers who described the tweet as 'tasteless' and 'unnecessary'.

'I have never met that guy Oliver Dunne, but I don’t think there is any need to post that pic [sic],' wrote one Twitter user.

The photo has since been deleted but Dunne did write a blog following the review by Ms O'Sullivan.

He wrote: 'I currently employ over 50 people between my various restaurants and I will always fight to protect mine and their livelihoods at all costs!'

According to the Irish Independent, he said: 'I've no problem with people coming through my door and critiquing the restaurant, that's the nature of the best, I've been at this 20 years, I know that.'

Dunne has since told the Independent that he is sorry for posting the photograph and for causing offense.

'If Lucinda wants an apology,' Dunne said. 'I would be happy to.'
