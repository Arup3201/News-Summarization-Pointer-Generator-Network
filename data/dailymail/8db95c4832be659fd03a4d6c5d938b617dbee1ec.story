Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney and wife Ann have given their first post-election interview to Fox News.

The couple’s chat with host Chris 
Wallace airs on Sunday, but in a clip released on Thursday they talked 
about their disappointment at losing last November’s election and about adjusting once the intensity of the campaign trail was over.

Mitt Romney compared the 
experience to riding a roller coaster. He told Wallace, ‘We were on a 
roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride 
ends, and then you get off. And it’s not like, “Oh, can’t we be on a 
roller coaster the rest of our life?” It’s like, no, that ride’s over.’

Ann Romney has said that running for president was like their experience of serving in the Mormon church

Wife Ann compared the experience to the service that the Romneys have carried out within the Mormon church.

‘In our church, we’re used to serving
and you know, you can be in a very high position, but you recognize 
you’re serving. And now all of a sudden, you’re released and you’re 
nobody. And we’re used to that. It’s like we came and stepped forward to
serve.

'And you know, the other part of it 
was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot 
of passion and a lot of - a lot of people around us and all of a sudden,
it was nothing,’ she said.

‘But the good news is we like each other,’ she joked.

Sharing the next phase of their lives, the couple additionally took a moment to present their family's latest additions after becoming grandparents to 20 children on Valentine's Day.

The couple cradled their son Craig's newborn twins before the cameras, one seen in a pink blanket and the other in blue.

The Romney have kept a low profile since Mitt conceding defeat to President Barack Obama at the election in November.

Gracious in defeat: Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, seen with wife Ann after conceding defeat to Barack Obama in November, has given his first interview since the election

Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, lost to President Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes.

He spent the month after the failed White House bid in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla, near San Diego, reflecting upon the campaign.

But almost four months on it is thought Romney is ready to return to public life and political debate.

The former Republican nominee is also due to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington next month.

He
is expected to receive a warm reception at the upcoming conference in 
Prince George's County, Maryland, where he is due to deliver a speech on
the economy.

A senior 
Romney aide has said the former Republican nominee would be taking the 
opportunity to 'thank all his supporters and friends' following the 2012
campaign.

American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas has said of Romney's slot at the conference: 'We look forward to hearing Governor Romney's comments on the current state of affairs in America and the world, and his perspective on the future of the conservative movement.'

Romney - who unlike other failed presidential candidates such as John McCain did not have a job in the Senate to go back to after the election - has taken up a seat on the board of Marriott hotels on a salary of $170,000.

The former boss of hedge fund Bain Capital is also believed to be considering setting up an organization similar to the Clinton Global Initiative, established by former President Bill Clinton in 2005.

Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is also set to speak at the event next month, as is Romney's former running mate Paul Ryan.
