Jeb Bush, former Florida governor for eight years, is facing questions after it was revealed that he was stood to profit from fracking if plans he was pushing were accepted

A former governor who pushed states to approve plans for fracking was stood to personally benefit from profits reaped from the controversial drilling.

Jeb Bush, Florida's governor for eight years until 2007, said that neglecting to approve fracking plans would lead to areas in America languishing.

But one of the 62-year-old's private equity enterprises was simultaneously raising $40 million to back a company acquiring fracking wells, the Tampa Bay Times reported on Friday.

Inflection Energy, based in Denver, already had active leases in Pennsylvania and hoped that New York would lift its ban. 

The hotly-tipped 2016 presidential candidate also co-owns a company called Proforce Energy Services, which provides sand for fracking.

The release of this information has renewed fresh fears about the relationship between politicians and business. 

Bush told conservatives in a speech in 2013 that New York was choosing not to grow because of its reluctance to approve drilling plans.

'Some states, like yours here in New York, are choosing not to grow. They won't approve fracking,' he said, according to the New York Post.

'Meanwhile, in parts of New York where huge opportunities exist for the restoration of economic activity, people languish.' 

He renewed his calls to government to ease regulations on fracking at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in San Francisco on January 23. 

Although he accepted fracking wasn't 'cool on the coasts' he told an audience that federal lands and waters should be open to energy exploration.

Last year Bush decided to resign from all of his corporate and nonprofit board memberships.

Kristy Campbell, his spokesman, said that Bush's review of his business interests were 'a natural next step as he turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy'.

The controversial process is used to extract gas and oils from rocks. One of the 62-year-old's private equity enterprises was raising $40million to back a company acquiring fracking wells

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process where water, chemicals and sand are drilled into the earth to break up rocks.

Doing this frees oils and natural gas.

Environmentalists object to the process because the drilling could also release chemicals into the water supply.
