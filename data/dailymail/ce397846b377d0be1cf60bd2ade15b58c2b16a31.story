Tamera Foster has narrowly missed out on a place in The X Factor semi-final.

The talented teen lost a sing-off to Luke Friend after the pair pulled in the lowest number of votes from the public after their performances on Saturday night's show.

While the 16-year-old starlet was saved by her mentor Nicole Scherzinger, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh voted to keep Luke in the competition, and head judge Gary Barlow decided it was only right to put the decision back in the hands of the viewers by sending the vote to deadlock.Â

Louis disagreed: 'Luke, you absolutely won the sing-off. You were easily the best person on that stage. You should not be in the bottom two and it's wrong! I'm sending home Tamera.'

After saying she could imagine Luke performing at Glastonbury the previous evening, Sharon added: 'As Louis said, that sing-off was such an organic, natural performance from a singer-songwriter musician. There was no competition, I have to send Tamera home.'
