Sir Bruce Keogh's Government report has called for tighter laws surrounding cosmetic surgery including the introduction of insurance

The British Association of Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) is to start offering insurance to patients who undergo plastic surgery with accredited surgeons.

Until now, no insurance policy for cosmetic surgery and the associated complications existed in the UK.

The move comes after a Government enquiry into cosmetic surgery were published last month. 

Medical director Sir Bruce Keogh called for new laws to overhaul the £2.3billion sector.

Two of the key demands cited in the report was for insurance to be provided by clinics and information for patients about the success rates of their surgeons.

BAAPS represents the vast majority of NHS practitioners and is the only plastic surgery society to conduct a yearly audit of the procedures performed by its members.

It worked with specialist insurers Lloyd’s of London to create a policy that would safeguard all patients of surgeons who are part of the association.

Because all BAAPS surgeons are covered by the insurance, patients do not need to take the insurance out themselves. The price of cover will be included in their quote for the surgery.

The new ‘Aesthetic Surgery Commitment’ or ‘ASC’ policy covers corrective treatment of all the most common complications of surgery, such as infection or bleeding, but also – a world first – capsular contracture, an abnormal reaction of the body to breast implants.

Up to one in ten women who undergo breast enhancement may develop this condition, but historically would have had to pay for corrective surgery themselves.

BAAPS President Rajiv Grover said: ‘In line with Sir Bruce Keogh’s recommendations for more safeguards in the aesthetic surgery sector, we are [launching] a truly innovative insurance package that will further protect our patients.

‘No procedure is risk-free and ASC covers all common complications, so people undergoing surgery with BAAPS members can enjoy peace of mind that they will be looked after, in the unlikely event of any problems.’

The most popular surgical procedures are included in the policy including tummy tucks, eyelid surgery, arm lifts, breast augmentation, ‘moob’ reduction (gynaecomastia), liposuction, facelifts, pinning back ears and fat grafting.

Common complications such as infection, haematoma (bleeding), seroma (build-up of fluid), nerve injury and others are also covered.

Many conditions can develop a month or longer after the procedure is undertaken – and in the case of capsular contracture, it could be several months - so the policy automatically activates on the twenty-ninth day after the op and remains live for two years, as during that initial period hospitals would cover any complications.
