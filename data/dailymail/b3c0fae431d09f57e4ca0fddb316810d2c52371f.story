The ice cream truck jingle is the sound of innocent childhood summers and also the melody to the most racist song in the history of the United States.

Still to this day the familiar tune is responsible for setting off frenzied excitement among children across the country.

Popularly known as the 19th century standard 'Turkey in the Straw', the song in fact owes its roots to minstrel song's including the offensively titled, 'N***** Love a Watermelon Ha! Ha! Ha!'

Racist history: The jingle played by most ice cream trucks is historically based on one of the most racist songs in the history on the United States

That song was directly spawned from another composition often performed in blackface called 'Zip C***' - which in turn lent its lyrics, but not the tune to the Oscar winning popular song, 'Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.'

The reason why a racist song has come to be so closely, albeit surreptitiously linked with ice cream trucks dates back to 19th century ice cream parlors.

Minstrel songs were the most popular form of entertainment at the time and therefore were played in these parlors, so when ice cream trucks appeared after World War Two, the same songs people associated were played.

An investigation by NPR discovered that the ice cream truck jingle, played by most, is directly linked to a song that was released in March 1916 by Columbia Records, it was written by actor Harry C. Browne and deeply rooted in racial ignorance.

Using a music hall call-and-response technique, Browne's lyrics were set to the melody of Turkey in the Straw, which is turn dates back to an even older British song, 'The Old Rose Tree.'

Browne: 'You n*****s quit throwin' them bones and come down and get your ice cream!"

Black men: (incredulously): 'Ice Cream?!?'

Browne: 'Yes, ice cream! Colored man's ice cream: Watermelon!'

The original song was brought to American shores by Scottish and Irish immigrants who settled along the Appalachian Trail.

Offensive: The Zip C*** was a blackface character who parodied a free black man attempting to conform to white high society

In the 1802s, the tune had its lyrics changed again for the 'Zip C***' song that was to be performed by a blackface character bearing the same name.

He was meant to parody a black man attempting to conform to white society and became the counterpart to the dimwitted character living in the south known as Jim Crow.

The two characters would interact in varying degrees of ignorant stereotypical styles of speech and song.

Indeed, for Theodore R. Johnson, III, the author of NPR's report, his new found knowledge troubles him.

'I can live with this, but what's to be done on the summer day when my children's eyes light up at the far-off sound of the familiar melody, and they dash in a frenzy toward me for change?' said Johnson.

'Do I empower them with the history of our country, or encourage the youthful exuberance induced by the ice cream truck? Is it my responsibility to foul the sweet taste of ice cream with their first taste of racism?'Â
