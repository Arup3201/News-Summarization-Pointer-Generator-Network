A Maine lobsterman reeled in a one in a million catch when when he trapped an extremely rare blue lobster.

Jay LaPlante of the Miss Meghan's Lobster Catch company told reporters he caught the unique crustacean about 10:45 a.m. Saturday roughly 10 miles from Portland.

It was his daughter Meghan, 14, who discovered the lobster while hauling in traps.

Its estimated that maybe 1 or 2 lobsters in a million are colored blue, according to figures from the University of Maine's Lobster Institute, USA Today reports.

The color is the product of a genetic defect causing the lobster to produce too much of a protein.

Meghan immediately named the two-pound lobster Skyler, and having bonded with it said it would not be cooked.

The two pound lobster, named Skyler, will be donated to the Maine State Aquarium

Instead, she'll make sure Skyler gets a good home at the Maine State Aquarium.

There he'll join three of his extraordinarily uncommon blue brothers and a solitary orange lobster.

WCSH6 notes the aquarium is open every day of the week from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. if you're in the area.
