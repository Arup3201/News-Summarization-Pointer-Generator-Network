This is the moment a 14-year-old boy was battered outside the school gates by a teenager who later emailed him a video of the attack as he lay in hospital getting treatment.

Akil Johnson-Richards was repeatedly punched and kicked by a fellow pupil while other students chanted 'kill him'.

Friends of the attacker filmed the assault on mobile phones outside the Emmanuel School in West Bridgford, Nottingham, and then sent it to the victim.

Assault: The unnamed attacker floored Akil with a single punch then continued to beat him as he lay stricken on the ground outside his Nottingham school

The fight happened as Akil walked out of school last Thursday.

The bigger pupil squared up to the teenager before he knocked the teenager to the ground with a punch to the head.

Parents collecting their children from school can be seen just yards away but no one steps into the stop the violence.

After the attack, Akil spent five hours in hospital where he needed X-rays to his ribs and treatment for a chipped tooth.

His distraught mother, Natasha Johnson-Richards, 40, has now withdrawn her son from the school, which caters for 900 pupils aged between 11 and 18.

Shocking: A crowd gathered chanting 'kill him', witnesses said, while parents also saw the attack at the end of the school day last week

The mother-of-three, who runs her own IT tutoring company, said: 'When I first saw Akil I felt shock and disbelief this had happened.

'I want people to be aware of what is going on - it's not right.

'He came home after the attack covered in blood and his uniform was torn. It looked like he'd been in a car crash.

'He just said he'd been attacked outside the school gates because of a row about a girl on Facebook.

'I rushed Akil to hospital where they initially thought he may have broken ribs and it about this time that Akil got the video of the attack emailed to him.

'I was sickened. It was a horrific attack outside the school gates just a few feet from parents.

'When I heard the pupils chanting 'kill him' I just knew there was no way my son was going back to that place.

'We have an appointment to get him into another school.

'Having spoken to other parents at Nottingham Emmanuel, bullying is a real problem which is not treated seriously by the staff.'

Akil, who has been too scared to walk outside since the attack, added: 'I was walking to the bus stop when some people crowded around me.

'One started pushing me, then he started hitting me.

'It lasted about a minute and I could see people videoing it.

'It makes me sad and angry, now I want to go to a new school.'

Incident: The fight happened at the gates of the Emmanuel School in Nottingham, says that it has spoken to the parents of both boys

Mrs Johnson-Richards, who also has a five-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter, claims Akil has also been shot in the chest with a plastic pellet gun and been thrown in a pond in the school grounds over the last 18 months.

She added: 'I'm not prepared to send him back. I don't believe he is safe there.'

Natasha has passed the footage of the video onto Nottinghamshire Police who are investigating.

A spokeswoman confirmed the latest incident had been reported as an assault.

Emmanuel School principal Carol Fearria said: 'We have spoken with the parents of both students and are taking swift and direct action in line with our behaviour policy. Such behaviour will not, under any circumstances, be tolerated.

'The school is not aware of any previous issues between the two students and neither student has suggested this to be the case.

'We have been working to support the student involved.

'Previous incidents involving the student have been fully investigated but we did not find that he had been specifically targeted in any way.'
