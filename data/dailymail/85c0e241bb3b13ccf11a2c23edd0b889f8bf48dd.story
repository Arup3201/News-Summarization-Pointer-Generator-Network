'Dream come true': Kevin Gardner, right, said catching the majestic 1,320lb Blue Marlin is one of his longstanding ambitions

A pub landlord claims to have caught one of the biggest fish ever by reeling in a 1,320lb blue marlin using just a rod and line.

Kevin Gardner said the catch was a 'dream' and now promises to go after a great white shark.

Mr Gardner, who set himself the challenge of catching a 'monster' fish 25 years ago, flew its spear-like snout 4,000 miles home to the UK from Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean to keep as a trophy.

The six metre-long fish is the fourth biggest caught anywhere in the world and believed to be the biggest ever caught by a Brit using a rod and line.

He landed the majestic fish after a three hour battle during a ten-day fishing trip.

Mr Gardner, who runs the King's Head pub in Coltishall, Norfolk, said: 'Within the first 15 seconds it had stripped off 700m of line, it hit it that fast.

'From where we hooked it to where we got it on the boat was approximately five miles.

'After about two hours I wished I had never hooked it.

'I
 was completely burned by the sun, I was suffering dehydration, I had 
blisters on my hands from all the reeling, my back ached and my feet 
were burned to a crisp.'

Although not yet on the endangered list, conservationists are concerned that blue marlin in the Atlantic are being over-fished.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified blue and white marlin as 'vulnerable'.

Mr Gardner is already planning his next challenge and wants to try and land a great white shark.

He said: 'We can't decide if we should go to South Africa to catch a great white shark or Nicaragua for a 250lb tarpon.

'One thing is for sure, I won't be chasing a blue marlin any more - that hurt too much.'

Mr Gardner was on the trip with friend Phil Riley, from Liverpool, and Olaf Grimkowksi, a German skipper on the 30ft Rampage boat Hamattan.

After
 battling with the fish under the 30 degrees South Atlantic heat he 
did not realise the size of his feat until he was safely back on shore.

He said: 'When we landed it no-one really knew how big it was. It was the end of a dream really. It was really hard work but it's going down really well with customers now.'

Kevin Gardner said he battled the giant blue marlin for three hours before finally landing it

He made the nine-and-a-half hour flight to and from Ascension Island on a military plane from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.

He spent 25 years trying to achieve his dream and even sold his house in 1988 to fund a trip to Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

He caught a 750lb black marlin on that occasion and vowed after that to snare a massive blue marlin.

The IGFA world record for Atlantic blue marlin is 1,402, which was caught near Brazil in 1992.

After his most recent trip, Mr Gardner brought home fillets of other fish, including tuna, he caught to serve to customers at his King's Head pub.

He said he also served 18 inch fillets from the marlin to 2,000 islanders as thanks for their hospitality.

Mr Gardner said: 'The fish definitely didn't get wasted that is for sure. I gave some of it to the dockworkers, local hotels and to the people who live on the island.

The 1,320lb marlin is the fourth biggest caught anywhere in the world and the biggest ever caught by a Brit

'I brought the bill back as a memento that I will put on my wall or something because it had never even come into my head that I would catch a fish that big.

'We caught the marlin on day eight of the trip and it was the only bite that we really had on our whole trip.

'I had a fairly substantial bar tab that night and we definitely celebrated in style.'

Kevin has been an angler since he was just three-years-old and has now filled a life-long ambition by catching the marlin.

He said: 'I'm a very keen angler and I sold my house when I went to Australia to catch a 750lb marlin 25 years ago.

'I wanted to catch a bigger one ever since and I haven't been able to match that until that trip. We have been fishing in New Zealand, Fiji, Panama, Costa Rica, all around the world.

'It has cost us a lot of money but I was going to carry on until I had caught one.

'If you take sharks out of it then it is probably the biggest fish ever caught by a Briton.

'But now I want to go to South Africa and try and catch a great white shark because they are really massive.'
