It's the dream of every internet startup founder to sell their company for millions of dollars.

But not everyone can make a quick buck like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg or the investors of Instagram who recouped enormous  amounts of money on their original investments.

In the case of one startup, Bloodhound 
Technologies, the five founders were left with comparatively little even
 though their company sold for tens of millions of dollars, according to the New York Times.

Disappointment: Bloodhound Technologies founder Joseph A. Carsanaro (left) and four co-founders including Aaron Seib (right) were left to split $36,000 after their company sold $82 million

Bloodhound was formed in the mid-1990s to create software for health care providers to monitor claims for fraud.

Mr Carsanaro began the company with four colleagues -Â  Samir Abed, Aaron Seib, Aldo Kiamtia, and Barry
 Taylor - and raised $1.9 million from venture capitalists in 
1999. The following year he raised another $3.1 million.

When Bloodhound Technologies was sold for $82.5 million in 2011, the five founders were paid a collective $36,000. Here's what each founder received:

The timing was not in Mr Carsanaro's favor, however. Within just a few years the internet bubble burst and the company began to struggle.

That's when investors took over the company and pushed out Carsonaro as CEO.

According to court proceedings, the investors convinced Bloodhound's board that replacing Carsonaro with a new CEO would make the company more marketable to potential buyers.

Carsonaro was asked to resign in December 2000. The move upset co-founder Abed, who was then also asked to resign, along with the three other founding employees of the company.

A new CEO was hired and over the next ten years and several more rounds of financing, the company recovered and began to expand.

Then
 in April 2011 the company sold for $82.5 million to Verisk Health Inc. Mr Carsanaro thought 
his payday had arrived and that he would become an instant millionaire.

Instant millionaire: Instagram co-founder and CEO Kevin Systrom sold his firm to Facebook for $300m and 23 million shares

Cheated: Despite the company selling for $84m, the five founders of Bloodhound Technologies split $36,000 between them. One founder of the company received just $99

But investors were paid first - before any of the founders and employees.

Eventually there was just $36,000 left in the pot to split between the five founders. One received just $99.

The founders filed suit, claiming that during several rounds of financing following their departure from the company, investors had schemed to dilute their collective holdings to less than 1 percent - without their knowledge - before selling the company.

In the end, Carsonaro received $29,266, Kiamtia received $4,967, Taylor received $993, Abed got $397 and Seib was left with $99.

The story is typical of the world of venture capital which can be a difficult and murky one to grasp.

Founders
 and employees can be hit in a brutal manner with majority of the cash 
from any sale going to venture capitalists and holders of preferred 
shares.

A recent study, by
 Profs. Brian J. Broughman and Jesse M. Fried, concluded in almost 50 
per cent of cases, investors were entitled to nothing - even when the 
company was sold for tens of millions of dollars.

Good negotiator: Naveen Selvadurai, co-founder of foursquare and has an estimated net worth of $80 million dollars

Lessons: A word of warning to budding entrepreneurs - negotiate your rights and payoff from the company at the very start

Some 20 per cent to 30 per cent of companies fail, returning nothing to any investor, so when venture capitalists risk supporting a startup they take their share before anyone else.

There is one trick to bare in mind, and that is to negotiate greater control rights.

Before being blinded by dollar signs, the crucial element is to ensure seats on the board or to insist in having a say in decisions such as if and when the company is sold in the years to come.

Professors Broughman and Fried found in 
their study that on average, such foresight saw founders receiving 
around $3.7 million more during any sale or takeover.

Whatta deal: Sacked Groupon CEO Andrew Mason was sacked and received $376.36 in severance pay, but he still owns $213 million in company shares

Tweeter: Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey has a net worth of $1 billion

For Bloodhound Technologies, eight years had passed since the original founders had been in the chair. It meant all new negotiations for cash investment had been carried out on the terms of the venture capitalists.

The five former colleagues are now suing in a Delaware court which, if a jury rules in their favor, the Times points out that it could change the way companies operate in future when it comes to balancing the payouts of founders and employees to the rewards that venture capitalists expect.
