Only Fools and Horses fan Peter Shaves had a very fitting send-off - with his coffin carried in a replica of Del Boy’s famous three-wheeler.

The grandfather died days before his 70th birthday after battling a long illness.

But wife Linda, 67, knew he would want to leave everyone smiling so she got in touch with Only Fools and Hearses funeral hire.

They provided a model of the yellow Robin Reliant which towed Peter’s hearse in a second three-wheeler with clear windows to his cremation service in Leighton Buzzard.

Linda said: 'Peter was such a huge fan of Only Fools and Horses, so we knew he would love it.

'He would never want us to be sad; he just wanted us to be able to look back and remember the happier times. It was what he wanted - to make sure everyone smiled.'

Linda, of Linslade, Bedfordshire, added: 'We decided to have the funeral on Peter’s 70th birthday so we could have a birthday party for him at the wake before we said our goodbyes.'

Only Fools and Horses was of the most popular sitcoms in the 1980s and 90s.

It brought catchphrases from wheeler-dealer Del Boy such as 'lovely jubbly', 'cushty', 'plonker' and 'this time next year we'll be millionaires' into living rooms across the country - and of course his iconic Robin Reliant which he would drive around to do deals.

Del Boy also had a love of French - albeit a garbled version - including phrases such as 'not goodbye, Margaret, no just bonjour' and using 'au revoir' for hello.

It was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials in later years.

One festive episode in 1996 - in which Del Boy and Rodney became wealthy following the discovery and sale of a valuable watch - attracted 24.3million viewers, the highest UK audience for a sitcom.

The real thing: The yellow three-wheeler (with actors David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst) was a regular feature on the hit BBC show
