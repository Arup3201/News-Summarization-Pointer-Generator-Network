The value of the rouble plummeted again today as Russia announced its economy had shrunk for the first time in more than five years. 

Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.5 per cent year-on-year to November, the economy ministry said, the first fall since October 2009.

The announcement sent the rouble - which fluctuated wildly earlier this month prompting fears of a full financial collapse - plummeting another 5 per cent against the dollar this morning.

Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have been looking to put their money in more stable investments abroad. 

The ministry chalked up the negative growth to a slowdown in a number of sectors including services, agriculture, extraction of mineral resources and construction.

Inflation is also growing rapidly. Amid the rouble's collapse earlier this month, Russia's central bank raised interest rates to 17 percent from 10.5 percent to prop up the currency.

Russians also snapped up imported goods ahead of expected price hikes.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov had already warned last week that the economy could shrink 4 per cent next year based on oil prices of around $60 a barrel -  their lowest level for many years.

He predicted a budget deficit of 3 per cent and said the government would have to further reduce expenses or tap into its reserves, noting that a planned 10 per cent spending cut was not enough.

The central bank has warned that the economy could contract by up to 4.8 per cent next year based on current oil prices, with a recovery not expected until 2017.

During the total length of the global recession from 2008, Britain's economy contracted 6.4 per cent while Japan's fell 8.7 per cent, Italy's fell 6.9 per cent and Germany's fell 6.8 per cent.

The Kremlin announced fresh steps today to keep Russia's banks afloat.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told a government session that he had just signed a decree to provide a total of a trillion roubles (£12.6billion) to Russian banks.

The list of the banks and the amount that each of them will receive is expected drawn up by mid-January, according to Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov.

Russia's central bank also said it will offer dollar and euro loans to banks so they can help major exporters that need foreign currencies to finance operations.

Many Russian companies and banks have been locked out of Western capital markets following the sanctions imposed on the country for its involvement in Ukraine. 

The bank's foreign currency reserve has now dropped below $400billion for the first time since August 2009, as the government has been selling the currency on the market to support its own.

Mr Shuvalov said the measures should help 'the banking sector be more stable in the new circumstances and safeguard it from new shocks if they do occur,' according to the Russian news service Tass.
