A farmer has been jailed after investigators found 350 dead and dying animals scattered around his land in the 'worst case' ever seen by the RSPCA. 

James Linsley was sentenced to 16 weeks imprisonment after animals were found 'knee deep' in faeces and gnawing off a horse's carcass to stay alive, Northallerton Magistrates' Court heard.

The 29-year-old, who was renting Woodside Farm in West Layton, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to 53 sheep, four cows, ten horses and a dog.

Officers discovered more than 350 dying and dead animals at the farm in the 'worst case' they had seen 

Some live animals were found 'knee deep' in faeces according to RSPCA officials who spent a week at the site 

Linsley, who was renting the property, was jailed for 16 weeks for his 'atrocious' treatment of animals

James Linsley was sentenced to 16 weeks in jail at Northallerton Magistrates' Court yesterday 

RSPCA Chief Inspector Mark Gent said: 'It was the worst case I have seen because of the sheer number of animals involved. 

'It was horrendous, the RSPCA were there for a week.

'There were dead and dying animals all over the place, some of this suffering had been going on for months.

'They were not given the food they should have been given.'  

The court heard how the investigation cost more than £100,000 in vet bills. Mr Gent, who said he was 'pleased' with the sentencing has applied for a disqualification order banning Linsley from keeping animals. 

Defending Simon Walker said the farmer had been faced with 'the perfect storm' during the cold winter. 

'This whole event was without precedent. Medication and food was on the farm, he just couldn't get it into the animals quickly enough.

'He is guilty by omission rather than commission.

'Horrendous': Officials spend a week at the farm where 350 animals, dead and alive, were being kept 

The farmer was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to 53 sheep, four cows, ten horses and a dog

Defending Simon Walker said the farmer had to face difficult conditions brought by the unusually cold winter

'He is a proud man, it is fair to say to some extent he does feel like a victim. He is a young farmer trying to establish himself in an extraordinarily difficult and unforgiving industry.' 

Judge Lower told Linsley: 'The scenes officers were met with were truly shocking. 

'The weather was poor but it didn’t mean it was impossible for you to attend to the needs of the animals, other farmers were dealing with them.

'All of this came about because of your stubbornness and pride, you must have been aware the situation had become too difficult for you. It was a truly atrocious situation.'
