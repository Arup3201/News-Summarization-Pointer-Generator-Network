So close to a morale-boosting victory in tricky circumstances, Liverpool’s defence crumbled again to let their lead slip against Ludogorets and raise fresh questions.

Individual errors from Simon Mignolet, Kolo Toure, and Alberto Moreno allowed the Bulgarian champions two goals  but collectively there were issues too.

Martin Skrtel and Javi Manquillo struggled at times to get their communication sorted allowing the nimble Ludogorets attackers opportunities to outmanoeuvre them. Glen Johnson was also flat-footed for the late equaliser.

Liverpool's shaky defence has now conceded 13 goals from set pieces this season 

Brendan Rodgers needs to find a solution to his defensive problems, but does he have the personnel?

Leadership is lacking across the backline and it tells a story that a £20million defender in Dejan Lovren is left on the bench for such a big game.

In 19 games this season, Liverpool have conceded 29 goals already – but more worryingly, 13 from set pieces. A seriously bad figure. So how does each player rate?

Simon Mignolet

Jamie Carragher believes the Belgian goalkeeper needs taking out of the side, such are his troubles. 

Simon Mignolet made a terrible error for Ludogorets' first goal in Bulgaria, allowing Dani Abalo to score

Mignolet has faced calls to be dropped after a series of mistakes have cost Liverpool points

He was awful in Sofia, shaky on crosses and failing to gather a routine shot to concede the opening goal. 

There are doubts he is up to the task at all and there are too many instances where he could do better.

Glen Johnson

He has lost his place in the England team due to uninspiring form but has featured 10 times for Liverpool this term.

Glen Johnson was generally solid on Wednesday, but his poor form has seen him lose his England place

Against Ludogorets he operated at left back and was generally sound but failed to provide an offensive thrust.

He did not to react quick enough at the corner which brought the late leveller.

Dejan Lovren

Where has the form gone that saw him star for Southampton? Maybe Jose Fonte deserves more recognition.

The former Southampton defender has looked poor value for money after his £20million transfer this summer

Nothing like a £20m defender, Lovren has played 17 games but rarely looked assured. Too often a diver into tackles, when standing off would pay dividends.

Martin Skrtel

Another with 17 games under his belt this season, it has become increasingly clear his style is edging over the line of legality too frequently. 

Martin Skrtel dives into a tackle  - the defender has already picked up six bookings this season

Penalised against Crystal Palace for grabbing hold of shirts, that is a tactic that ultimately will harm more than it helps. He has been booked six times already.

Kolo Toure

Emerged with credit from the reserve side sent out at the Bernabeu at the start of November but Lodogorets was his first match in a month and just his fifth of the season. 

Despite a good performance against Real Madrid last month, Kolo Toure has been used sparingly

A poor clearance allowed the first goal, sleepy marking the second. It was his man who scored.

Mamadou Sakho

Just five games this season for the France centre half who cost £18million last summer and none since late September due to a thigh injury.

Given he only played 19 times last campaign the jury is still out. There does seem a good defender in there, but supporters at Anfield are yet to see him.

Mamadou Sakho is back in training but hasn't played for Liverpool since September due to a thigh injury

Javi Manquillo

At 20, he may need time to adjust to the English game having come from Atletico Madrid. He only played nine senior games for the Spanish club before moving to Liverpool. 

Javi Manquillo has already played more games for Liverpool than he did in his time at Sevilla

He already has 14 matches under Brendan Rodgers. In Sofia, he never seemed sure who to pick up as Ludogorets interchanged positions.

Alberto Moreno

Looked a proper player when driving down the left wing at White Hart Lane and dispatching an arrow into the bottom corner for his first Liverpool goal. But mistakes are common. 

Erred against Manchester City early in the season and, after coming on in Bulgaria, allowed his man to get a flick on at the corner that found an equaliser.

After a promising start with an excellent goal against Tottenham, Alberto Moreno has looked out of his depth

Jose Enrique

Just four games for the full back this season, after losing his place to Jon Flanagan last campaign, and was part of the defence that got ripped apart by QPR in October. His last appearance due to a knee injury.

Jose Enrique, who has not played since the scrappy win over QPR, has only four appearances this season

Amid a defence that is causing the Liverpool manager untold headaches, he can at least draw one positive. At least none of them are doing anything to attract the attentions of Barcelona or the like.
