Jailed: Gary Jones, 49, went to his sister's holiday home and trashed it because his family did not send him a birthday card

A resentful son who trashed his sister's holiday home in revenge for not being sent a birthday card by his family has been jailed.

Gary Jones, 49, was so angry that both his mother and sister forgot his birthday he sent them a stream of threatening messages before trashing the property in Torquay, Devon.

He smashed the windows of the seaside holiday home, scrawled his name on the walls and left the taps and gas cooker on in the hope of running up huge utility bills.

Jones has a long-standing grudge against his mother who he accuses of showing favouritism towards his sister Gail, Exeter Crown Court heard.

The former trucker, from Torquay, admitted burglary and criminal damage at the house in August and was jailed for two years today by Judge Phillip Wassall.

The judge told him: 'This offence was motivated by resentment after an expected birthday card failed to arrive. You say it was a cry for help but my reading is that this is a rather twisted view.

'This is a very sad case but resentment plainly lay behind what happened. You gained entry to your sister’s house by smashing a window and turned on the taps and the gas cooker, all with the aim of costing her as much as you could.

'You wrote your name in pencil on the walls. Your mother and sister say they are fearful of you.

'Your mother has stood by you throughout everything but says she feels uncomfortable in her home because she believes one day you will go there and do something very serious.

'The vitriol and force of language in the messages you left on her phone is quite shocking.

'You caused extensive damage to the property because of a perceived grievance that went back years.'

Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said Jones rang his mother’s answerphone three times before going to his sister Gail’s house and demanded £5,000.

Holiday home: Gary Jones went round to his sister's holiday home in this road in Torquay, Devon, broke in and scrawled obscenities on the wall, Torquay Crown Court was told

He threatened to smash all the windows and said he did not care if he was arrested because he intended to denounce his mother and sister to police as benefit fiddlers.

In his calls, Jones accused his mother of ignoring his birthday and giving everything she wanted to his sister and nothing to him.

Police were called by neighbours to the holiday home in Torquay after they heard a window being smashed and they found Jones outside with food and alcohol he had taken from the property.

The messages on the walls included his name, obscenities, and a smiley face.

Miss Pitts said: 'His mother and sister are petrified of him.'

Mr Lee Bremridge, defending, said Jones has long standing problems arising from a head injury which he suffered when he fell out of a tree as a child.

He said this caused memory loss which forced him to give up his career as a lorry driver because he could not remember where he was going.

He said Jones had been doing well with treatment from a clinic in Torbay but his support had been reduced earlier this year and he started abusing alcohol.

He had long standing family problems caused by his belief that he had been less favoured than his sister over many decades.
