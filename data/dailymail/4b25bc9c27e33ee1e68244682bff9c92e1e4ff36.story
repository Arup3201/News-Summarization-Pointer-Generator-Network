A healthy-looking Paul Gascoigne has moved into a new home weeks after being seen staggering around his old flat amid rumours he was to be evicted. 

The former England footballer was seen in the garden of his new Dorset home, celebrating the transition with a cup of coffee and a cigar in the autumn sunshine. 

It comes after worrying photographs of the 47-year-old showed him clutching a bottle of gin in his dressing gown and looking dishevelled in local pubs emerged last month.
