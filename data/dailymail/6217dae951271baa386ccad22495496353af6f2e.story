Would you live in a parking space-sized house?

That’s what one group of students are hoping will solve the housing crisis.

Their unique invention could provide urban dwellers with alternative living arrangements.

No place like home? The Savannah College of Art and Design has unveiled their miniature houses, called SCADpads, that they say could solve the housing crisis

SCAD stands for the Savannah College of Art and Design, a private university with locations in Atlanta, Georgia in the US, and also Hong Kong and France.

The world’s urban population is currently 3.5 billion.

It is expected to hit 5 billion by 2035.

81% of the US population lives in urban areas.

But there is already a shortage of housing for people in populous cities.

There are apparently 105 million parking spaces in the US.

That is apparently five spaces for every car.

Half of all spaces are vacant 40% of the time.

These, the university says, can be used to solve the housing crisis by filling them with SCADpads.

It was students from Savannah in Atlanta that came up with this design when they were tasked with making use of a five-storey car park.

They came up with these mini-houses that are not only small enough to fit in a parking space but also affordable, each costing an estimated £24,000 (£40,000) to build.

‘As the housing shortage in crowded cities becomes increasingly apparent, President Paul Wallace and SCAD designers have answered the call with the university’s boldest innovation yet,’ the university said in a statement.

‘Branded as a luxury product, SCADpad features an individualised interior, interactive controls and green amenities.

‘The micro homes feature custom exterior and interior elements, modular wall systems, automated home control, sustainable waste management and multifunctional, multipurpose 3-D printed furniture.’

A few students in Atlanta have been selected to trial the SCADpads for a few days to give feedback on the miniature homes.

Each of the homes contains all the amenities you’d expect to find in a regular house.

The 135-sq ft residences are surprisingly spacious and include a toilet, bed, desk and kitchen.

Ultimately, it’s hoped that multiple SCADpads can be used to create small housing communities in unused parking lots.

While only in prototype phase at the moment, the university hopes that in future vacant parking lots can be filled with these miniature homes to solve the housing crisis

Each SCADpad comes with most of the things you'd expect from a full-sized home including a desk, bed, bathroom and kitchen

Big problem, tiny solution? Each SCADpad is 8 feet wide and 16 feet long, small enough to fit in a parking space

All electronics in the SCADpad are controlled through an iPad.

Lighting can be changed from a deep blue to a bright orange.

The windows can be frosted and unfrosted to give you privacy or scenery when you need it.

The shelving within is 3D-printed.

Some of the homes have interactive wallpaper that plays music when it’s touched.

The houses heat up quickly, so not much energy is needed to keep them warm.

There is also a filtration system tied into the shower and sink.

The windows can't be opened, but the SCADpads do have air conditioning and ventilation fans.

According to the university, the global urban population will hit 5 billion people in the next two decades, while 81 per cent of the U.S. population lives in urban areas.

But, they say, the world’s most populous cities are struggling to cope with this influx of people and there is a shortage of suitable housing.

This project is designed to address the problem by utilising space that is otherwise going unnoticed, in car parks.

Three pilot SCADpads have now been developed in a process that took 10 months.

But, the university says each unit could eventually be constructed in one to two months.

Three 'model homes' are on display at the moment, when they will be lived in by students for a few days to give feedback on what it's like to live in the enclosed spaces
