Baroness Thatcher smiled as she watched a video of playful puppies in the final hours before her death, it emerged last night.

It was thought to be her last sign of contentment and she shared it with her trusted friend and former adviser Lord Powell, who visited her often at the Ritz hotel.

The video was of eight biscuit-coloured Dachshund puppies and their mother, belonging to Lady Powell, the Italian wife of the former prime minister’s trusted Downing Street private secretary.

Sitting with her at her suite in the Ritz on Sunday night, Powell was the last person to visit her as she neared the end of her life.

He took out his iPad to entertain his former boss and on it he showed her a video that his wife had sent him from their home outside Rome, which Lady Thatcher had visited for several years running before she became too unwell.

Did Baroness Thatcher face a tougher job as prime minister than David Cameron does today?

Lady Powell said her husband had told her she smiled at the antics of the puppies and their mother.

She told the Guardian: ‘That was probably her last smile. After seeing her, Charles’s comment was, “I’m afraid that she will not be with us for very long. I think she’s drifting away.”’

She passed away the following morning. 
Lord Powell was among a small circle of trusted friends who visited Lady
Thatcher to keep her entertained and stimulated.

His wife said he went to see her nearly every week when he was in London.

Sometimes the pair would sing hymns and he would read to her, often from the biographies of other prime ministers.

He would joke with her that the political world was waiting for her return.

Lady Powell said: ‘He’d say, “You see? They’re waiting for us.”

'And she’d reply, “Oh, yes. We must go back.”’

Lady Thatcher visited the Powells' sprawling villa near Rome every summer for several years before she became too ill last year.

Baroness Thatcher's died on Monday inside her Ritz suite, where she spent the final months of her life.

Surrounded by the people who cared for her, the Iron Lady died 'peacefully' here following a stroke at 11.28am on Monday, as she sat up and quietly read.

Lady Thatcher, who had suffered a series of mini-strokes over the past decade, recognised the symptoms as she fell ill in the luxurious room, 'but this was the one that killed her', a friend said.

The suite, which would cost up to £3,660 a night, boasts 24 carat gold leaf and antique Louis XVI furnishings, and is the size of a small flat.

It is still unclear what Lady Thatcher was reading when she died, but insiders say it could have been that morning's newspapers.

Lady Thatcher may have been paying for the room at a reduced rate or getting it for free from the Barclay brothers, who own the hotel and the Daily Telegraph.'She had been having a series of blips and this was just another one. She recognised the symptoms and that she was having a little stroke and this was the one the killed her. The doctor was called but it was very quick,' her friend said.
