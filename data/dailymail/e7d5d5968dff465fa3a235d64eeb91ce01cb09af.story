A domestic treble is a marathon rather than a sprint. Yet Celtic are closer to their promised land after routing the Arabs in Scottish football’s answer to the six-day war.

By 5pm on Saturday, Dundee United were worn out. As punch drunk as a flabby heavyweight leaning against the ropes in the 14th round. Exhausted — mentally and physically — by three losses in a week to a side with more depth, energy and firepower.

The Tayside team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1-1 Scottish Cup draw with nine men a fortnight ago. Then Celtic won the League Cup Final. And followed it with a thumping 4-0 victory in last Wednesday’s Scottish Cup replay.

Battered and bruised, United were gone then. Long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match.

The heat, light and fury which bred six red cards, three penalties and running feuds in the previous meetings had gone. All told, Celtic and Dundee United met four times in two weeks. By the end, Jackie McNamara’s team were pleased the ordeal was over.

The same might be said of the title race. In Saturday’s early game, Aberdeen shipped two points in Dundee. The Dens equaliser came from the grandson of former Parkhead chairman Jack McGinn. Proof, if it were needed, that this was Celtic’s week.

‘It’s been a great week,’ said defender Efe Ambrose. ‘We know that, but we don’ t want to look at what we’ve done. We want to look forwards and that means the next game. That’s more important than what we’ve already done.

‘Every game counts in the league and we want to keep going. From now until the end of the season, we want to keep doing our best, so we can defend our title and get to the Scottish Cup Final. Then we can see if the Treble is still possible.’

The Scottish Cup looks the last substantial hurdle. Inverness, an awkward opponent, await in the semi-final on April 19. Thereafter it is Hibs or Falkirk in the Final.

‘It’s an enjoyable place to be at the moment because everything is working well for us,’ said Ambrose.

‘I think, right now, it would take a lot of effort from another team to stop us.

‘Celtic are playing at a top level. It’s difficult for others to withstand what we have right now.

‘We have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form. It’s difficult for the manager to pick his starting line-up. There’s a lot of competition in the squad and that makes us better.’

There was nothing boastful in the way the Nigerian said this. He was merely stating a bald truth. 

For the fourth meeting with United in a fortnight, Ronny Deila replaced his entire front four. Leigh Griffiths, Kris Commons, James Forrest and Anthony Stokes made way for John Guidetti, Stefan Johansen, Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven.

Mackay-Steven and Armstrong were United’s star players until they were sold to Celtic for £2million in January.

Once again, Tannadice chairman Stephen Thompson had cause to ponder if it was worth it when Mackay-Steven smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes, accepting a simple Ambrose pass and winding up for a swerving left-foot shot from fully 25 yards.

As a former United player, his reluctance to celebrate was understandable. Why Guidetti did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping, deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out.

By then, Celtic were playing a training game. A flat affair, given the ill feeling of the previous encounters, the home support could barely even bring themselves to boo Ryan McGowan.

There was a brief flash of the old enmity when Paul Paton was lucky to escape a red card for a wild, scything tackle on Mackay-Steven on the stroke of half-time.

If a yellow was a lenient punishment, Celtic added to the penalty by scoring a third when Virgil van Dijk thumped Johansen’s low free-kick towards goal before Jason Denayer intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3-0.

The Belgian has found a rich vein of form and, as with van Dijk, the Celtic support should enjoy him while they can. Dundee United came close just once, when substitute Ryan Dow had a dipping, long-range effort tipped over the bar by Craig Gordon. In truth, the visitors looked utterly demoralised by then.

‘I thought we were soft in the first half and we accepted things,’ said McNamara. ‘So I told them I was disappointed in that. I was a bit angry at half-time about belief and not just pride, but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves.

‘In the second half, we did that. We rolled up our sleeves, though it could be argued that Celtic took their feet off the gas.’

They could afford to conserve their energies. Only three times in Celtic’s 127-year history have the club won a Treble and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth.

‘I never allow myself to think about the Treble,’ parried Ambrose. ‘None of us do.

‘The most important thing for the team is to go game by game and that’s what the manager wants. We take it as it comes.

‘We don’t put anything in our heads. The important thing is to play hard and prepare. Everyone wants to beat Celtic.

‘It’s important that we’re calm and work to the tactics the manager wants us to play.

‘We need to have one spirit, one heart. We have good momentum right now and I think we have delivered what the manager expected. We’re almost there.

‘But we’re not there yet, so we have to keep pushing in training. Every time we play a game, he wants us to improve, so that’s a challenge he has given to us.’

A popular whipping Bhoy when things go wrong, it’s worth recording that Ambrose himself has improved of late.

The Green Brigade sang his name on Saturday, prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right-back than centre-half.

‘The Celtic supporters are the best in the world,’ said the defender, ‘I will give them credit for that.

‘Sometimes it’s unfair if I get criticism but that’s football. We’re a team, not individuals.

‘If a mistake happens, you just have to get on with it, work harder and make sure you correct the mistake.’

Of late, Deila’s Celtic have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes, but eradicate them. As the final mile of the marathon approaches, they are pacing themselves nicely.
