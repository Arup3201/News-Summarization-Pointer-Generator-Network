The new season hasn't even started yet, but Brendan Rodgers is already facing a pivotal few weeks.

Exactly how the manager goes about his business in the transfer market will shape Liverpool's campaign.

With the club ready to sell prized asset Luis Suarez to Barcelona for a huge £80million, the Anfield coffers will be bursting.

Big shoes to fill: Brendan Rodgers has a huge task on his hands if shamed striker Luis Suarez is sold to Barcelona

But how exactly do you replace Suarez? It's not going to be easy.

Rodgers has already signed Rickie Lambert from Southampton for £4million. The England international has his qualities, but he isn't a like-for-like replacement for the Uruguayan.

Emre Can has arrived from Bayer Leverkusen for £9.75million - but the Germany Under-21 star is a box-to-box midfielder.

Adam Lallana followed Lambert from St Mary's today in a deal understood to be worth £23million.

Lallana was fantastic for the Saints last season; his call-up into England's World Cup squad a reward for his excellent campaign.

But on the biggest stage of all in Brazil, Lallana, like most of the squad, failed to make an impact as England crashed out at the first hurdle.

Club record signing: Roberto Soldado joined Tottenham from Valencia for a fee of £26million

Big money arrival: Paulinho joined Tottenham from Corinthians in 2013 for a fee of around £17million

The money is there at Anfield - but Rodgers must spend it wisely.

Rodgers must ensure that he doesn't make the same mistakes Tottenham made in the transfer market last summer.

The parallels between Liverpool and Spurs are obvious.

The £85million sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid saw Andre Villas-Boas and sporting director Franco Baldini embark on a huge spending spree that saw the club smash their transfer record three times.

First, Paulinho arrived from Corinthians for £17million, then Roberto Soldado for £26million from Atletico Madrid and then Erik Lamela from Roma for £30million.

From the three, Paulinho is the only signing that resembles any sort of value for money.

When it came to the crunch, Tottenham, despite spending in-excess of £100million on fresh talent, were missing one vital component: Bale.

Controversial: Luis Suarez has been linked with a move to Barcelona after being banned from football for four months after biting Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup game between Uruguay and Italy

When such quality leaves a football club, it's nigh on impossible to replace.

Rodgers will be mindful of that in his pursuit of trying to ensure Suarez's pending departure to the Nou Camp will not have a profound impact on his team.

The Liverpool manager must decide whether to follow Spurs' example by trying to replace Suarez with several signings designed to strengthen his squad as a whole, or to spend the majority of the cash on one ready-made world class replacement.

It's a tough call, but one that will shape Liverpool's season.

Rodgers is interested in Benfica forward Lazar Markovic, who is viewed as one of the best emerging prospects in European football.

VIDEO Rodgers 'excited' by signings

Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri, who will play in midfield for Switzerland versus Argentina later today, is also on Liverpool’s wanted list while the club hope to add Lille’s exciting forward Divock Origi.

All three are under the age of 23, suggesting Rodgers would be buying potential rather than proven quality.

But whoever comes in at Anfield this summer will be presented with a clear reference point of what is required.

Thirty-one goals and 19 assists. A tall order for one - or even four players.
