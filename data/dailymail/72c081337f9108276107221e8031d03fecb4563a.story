Jennifer Whiteley, 27, died after apparently taking the so-called 'legal high' Benzo Fury: Her family paid tribute to her as 'a wonderful person loved by everyone'

A talented trainee psychologist has died after taking a party drug that was outlawed less than a month ago.

Jennifer Whiteley, 27, was taken ill after sniffing a drug called Benzo Fury - a former ‘legal high’ which was temporarily banned by the Government last month over health fears.

The former A-star Catholic girls' school pupil was rushed to hospital but suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards.

Detectives originally believed she may have taken a pink Ecstasy-type tablet from a rogue batch feared to have killed 11 other people but officers recovered Benzo Fury powder from her home in Sale, Greater Manchester.

Yesterday, as police issued a warning over the dangers of party drugs, her family paid tribute to the blonde Masters graduate who was setting out on a career in psychology.

She was working as a mental health carer and had seen her articles published in the Journal of Health Psychology.

In a statement her distraught family last night said their daughter was a ‘young, caring and beautiful woman.’

The family said: ‘Jennifer was passionate about her field of study and wanted to help people wherever she could. You could put her with a group of people covering every age, creed and colour and she could engage with all of them.

‘The overwhelming response from all the people who knew her, is that this young, caring and beautiful woman was a wonderful person loved by everyone and her loss will affect them all deeply.’

The tragedy unfolded in the early hours of Saturday morning when Miss Whiteley collapsed after taking the amphetamine-type drug 6-APB at her home.

It is thought she and her boyfriend both attended a hospital after suffering an adverse reaction to the drug.

Miss Whiteley died from a heart attack though her boyfriend recovered and later discharged himself after receiving treatment.

Jennifer obtained an MSc in health psychology from Staffordshire University. She collapsed early Saturday at home after taking banned party drug

Police said officers were now awaiting toxicology results to establish how Jennifer died.

In the statement her family said that growing up Miss Whiteley was an exceptional pupil achieving 11 GCSEs, including 3A*, 2 A-levels and three AS levels.

She went on to Manchester Metropolitan University where she obtained a 2.2 BSc Honours degree in psychology and subsequently an MSc in health psychology from Staffordshire University.

Detective Inspector Frank Morris said: ‘We will not be able to confirm the cause of this woman’s death until we get toxicology results. However, we recovered a powder which is a ‘legal high’ known as Benzo Fury, the legality of which is the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities.

‘Taking drugs can not only have dire consequences for the person taking them but also for their family and friends.’

Benzo Fury, a mild stimulant that acts like amphetamines, is one of two legal highs which was banned for one year by the government last month.

Announcing the temporary ban Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said it was being done to ‘protect the public’ and prevent ‘misery’.

They have banned Benzo Fury and another legal high NBOMe while the government’s advisory council on the misuse of drugs assesses whether the ban should be made permanent.
