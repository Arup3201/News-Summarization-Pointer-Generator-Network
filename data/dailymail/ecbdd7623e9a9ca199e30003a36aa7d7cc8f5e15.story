Great-grandmother Jennie Bryant (pictured) died on July 5 following an alleged assault by another patient at Brockwell Court nursing home

An 89 year-old woman died as a result of a blow to the head following an alleged attack by a fellow nursing home resident, an inquest heard.

Jennie Bryant, who suffers with dementia, was believed to have suffered the injury during an argument with another elderly patient at Brockwell Court nursing home on June 28. 

The great-grandmother was taken to University Hospital North Durham for treatment but died a week later on July 5, Crook Coroners Court heard. 

A 71 year-old male resident of the care home has been subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act.

Dr Leslie Hamilton, assistant coroner for Durham and Darlington, was told the woman's death was a result of blunt trauma to the head following the alleged assault. 

Dr Hamilton: 'She died due to an assault at the nursing home possibly from another resident.

'Investigations are being under taken by the police.

'A post-mortem was carried out by Dr Jenny Bolton on July 6 and at the request of the police a second post-mortem was carried out.' 

Durham Constabulary and the Care Quality Commission opened an investigation into what happened and police arrested a 71 year-old male resident on suspicion of assault at the time of the incident.

The man no longer lives at Brockwell Court, having been subsequently detained at a hospital under the mental health act.

Following the hearing on Monday, Durham police said their investigation was ongoing and they had been unable to interview the 71-year-old as he remains detained under the Mental Health Act.
