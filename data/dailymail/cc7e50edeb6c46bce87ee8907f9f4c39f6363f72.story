In a press release on Friday, he also said: 'This is something I have always wanted.

'Whether I will succeed or not, time will tell, however I do not want to regret not having tried my best and must give it a go.

'Today my dad comes specially to my mind. He taught me everything or almost everything I know about golf and I would have loved him to see me turning pro. I am sure he would be very proud and happy.' 

Javier told Spanish media that his next tournament will be the Alps Tour in December .
