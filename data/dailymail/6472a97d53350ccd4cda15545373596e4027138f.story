A teacher at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, whose notable alumni include Amy Winehouse, has been arrested on suspicion of possessing indecent images of children.

Sylvia Young OBE, 76, confirmed that a male teacher at the school had been arrested about a month ago and had left the premises with police officers.

She told the Mail that the man had worked at the school for a number of years and taught on the academic side, rather than at the stage school.

Police arrested the teacher and seized his personal computer from the fee-paying school for 10-16-year-olds, which has day pupils and boarders.

Notable alumni of the central London school include actor Billie Piper, Spice Girl Emma Bunton, presenter Denise van Outen and X Factor star Leona Lewis.

The teacher is now on police bail and can have no contact with the school or any child under 16. He has also been suspended from the premises in Marylebone.

The incident happened during term time and came during an unrelated assessment by the Independent Schools Inspectorate.

Miss Young added that an email would be sent out to parents at the school tomorrow to ‘allay their fears’ and said that the teacher had been fully vetted.

Miss Young told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s true that a teacher has been arrested after allegations that he had inappropriate material on his computer. It’s not linked to the school or our pupils.

‘At the moment, these are still allegations. The person may not even be charged. He might well be innocent.

‘Police came to the office and asked to speak to the person and then he left with them. We had no idea. 

'This person, who has worked here a good few years, was fully vetted.

‘It was very quietly done. There was no big police raid. They just asked to see the gentleman and he left with them.

‘We want to assure parents. We’ll send an email to parents tomorrow to allay their fears.’

When asked the age of the children he taught, she said ‘across the range’.

She would not confirm what the man taught and what his access to the children at the school was, but said that he was on the academic side.

An education source told the Sun on Sunday that it looked like the police were acting on a tip-off.

The Sylvia Young Theatre School is the most famous in Britain and has produced many of today’s leading celebrities, singers and actrors.

Miss Young is married to Norman Ruffell and the pair have two children, former actresses Frances Ruffelle and Alison Ruffelle. Her granddaughter is pop singer Eliza Doolittle.

Sylvia Young opened the school in 1981 and was appointed OBE in 2005.
