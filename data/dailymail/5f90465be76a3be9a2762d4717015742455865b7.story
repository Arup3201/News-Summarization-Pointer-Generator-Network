Kurdish forces have managed to oust Isis terrorists from their Kobane stronghold on the Syrian - Turkish border after months of intense fighting. 

It is believed that 1,800 people have died in the battle which lasted more than four months. 

Foreign media were able to film some of the clashes from the relative safety of the Turkish side of the border.

The four-month battle for Kobane has claimed at least 1,800 lives after Isis tried to seize the strategic town

Ordinary people took to the streets to celebrate the Isis defeat which is a major setback for the terror group

Isis tried a major frontal assault on the Kurdish town of Kobane, prompting much of the civilian population to flee over the Turkish border. 

However, strong pockets of opposition managed to hold out against the Isis assault and eventually managed to go on the offensive. 

U.S. aircraft and drones targeted Isis positions around the town, preventing any major counter attacks. 

Yesterday, Kurdish troops raised their flags above the town of Kobane after claiming to have driven out the final Isis resistance. 

It was also announced that Iraqi forces had managed to liberate the town of Diyala from Isis control.

U.S. and coalition aircraft launched 17 airstrikes against Isis position in 24 hours ousting the terrorists 

Kurdish fighters have secured 90 per cent of Kobane, with small numbers of Isis reported in the east of town

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) had 'expelled all Islamic State fighters from Kobane and have full control of the town'.

Rami Abdel Rahman of the Observatory said: 'The Kurds are pursuing some jihadists on the eastern outskirts of Kobane, but there is no more fighting inside now.'

US Central Command said Kurdish forces now had control of 90 percent of Kobane.

'While the fight against ISIL (Isis) is far from over, ISIL's failure in Kobane has denied them one of their strategic objectives,' Central Command said in a statement.

Kurdish forces were carrying out 'mopping-up operations' against remaining IS forces in the Maqtala district, on the town's eastern outskirts.

Kurdish people have started returning to Kobane, now that the security situation has improved

YPG spokesman Polat Jan also announced the news on Twitter, writing: 'Congratulations to humanity, Kurdistan, and the people of Kobane on the liberation of Kobane.'

Mustafa Ebdi, an activist from the town, said the 'fighting has stopped'.

Kurdish forces are advancing slowly through the eastern sections of Kobane because of the threat posed by improvised explosive devices, snipers and other types of booby trap.

The rout of Isis forces followed 17 airstrikes targeting Isis positions over a period of 24 hours. 

The Pentagon confirmed that Coalition aircraft attacked 'tactical units', 'fighting positions', an Isis controlled vehicle as well as staging areas. 

Sources claim that Isis has lost almost 1,200 men in its failed attempt to capture Kobane.

During the early stages of the battle, it seemed inevitable that the terror group was going to over-run the strategic city after they captured large amounts of advanced weaponry from Syrian and Iraqi troops. 

But Kurdish forces, supported by air raids led by the United States, halted the Isis onslaught. 

The Kobane defeat is a significant blow for Isis who had made significant territorial advances since 2013. 

Analyst Mutlu Civiroglu said: 'Despite all that manpower, all that sophisticated weaponry, Isis couldn't get the city, so it's a big blow for their plans and its a great achievement for the Kurds,

'Kobane sets an example on the ground, showing that when you have skilled fighters on the ground with the support of air strikes, this danger, these forces, can be stopped and eliminated.'

Civilians were largely spared in the fighting because they evacuated en masse, mostly across the border into Turkey, in the early stages of the battle.

Over the border in Iraq, the army announced another defeat for IS, with the recapture of Diyala province.

Many Kobane residents missed the worst of the fighting by crossing the Turkish border to safety 

The Kurdish YPG produced banners praising some of their fighters who died in the defence of the town

Isis began its major assault on Kobane in September after destroying 300 nearby Kurdish villages

Staff Lieutenant General Abdulamir al-Zaidi said: 'We announce the liberation of Diyala from the Isis organisation.

'Iraqi forces are in complete control of all the cities and districts and subdistricts of Diyala province.'

The general said there would still be clashes however against IS in the rural Hamreen mountains, which stretch across multiple provinces, including Diyala.

Among international forces training the Iraqi military, Canadian special forces have twice exchanged gunfire with Isisfighters since the first confirmed ground battle in Iraq between Western troops and the jihadists earlier this month, a senior officer in Ottawa said.

Captain Paul Forget said: 'Two similar events have occurred over the last week and, in both cases, Canadian special operations forces, again acting in self-defence, effectively returned fire, neutralising the threat.'

No Canadians were injured.

Capturing Kobani would have given Isis control of a border crossing with Turkey and open direct lines for their positions along the frontier. Now, it is a grave psychological loss for the extremist group, which has been dealt a series of military setbacks in both Syria and Iraq, particularly at the hands of the Kurds.

Last month, Kurdish fighters in Iraq retook the strategic town of Sinjar that had been home to many of Iraq's minority Yazidis.

The focus is now expected to shift to several hundred villages around Kobani still held by the militants. Kurdish activists said they expected the fight for those to be easier than for the town itself.

In September, Isis fighters began capturing about 300 Kurdish villages near Kobani and thrust into the town itself, occupying nearly half of it and sending tens of thousands of residents fleeing into Turkey.

But the once-nondescript town with few resources quickly became a centerpiece of the international campaign against Isis. 

Thousands of Kurdish civilians sought refuge in camps on the Turkish side of the border after Isis  massacred civilians as the terror group moved through some 300 villages outside Kobane

TV crews flocked to the Turkish side of the border and trained their cameras on the besieged town, plumes of smoke rising from explosions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry declared it would be 'morally very difficult' not to help Kobani.

The U.S.-led air assault began September 23, with Kobani the target of about a half-dozen daily airstrikes on average. More than 80 percent of all coalition airstrikes in Syria have been in or around the town.

The United States has air-dropped supplies to Kurdish forces on the ground while wiping out dozens of Isis positions 

By early January, more than 1,000 Islamic State fighters had been killed and much of its heavy weaponry destroyed. The group continued to invest in resources, bringing in hundreds of reinforcements. Activists said these included many teenagers and even children, signaling a shortage in its forces.

The group made a last stand in the past few weeks, unleashing more than 35 suicide attacks in recent weeks, activists said. But the advancing Kurdish fighters could not be stopped.

Isis troops are believed to have fled the area, leaving behind heavy weapons and fresh food, after 'their morale collapsed', according to local media reports.
