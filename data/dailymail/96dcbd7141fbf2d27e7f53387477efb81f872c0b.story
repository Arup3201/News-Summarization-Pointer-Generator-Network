New Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu is known for his efficient administration

Known for his efficient administration, new Rail Minister Suresh Prabhu has given himself a three-year target to turn around the fortunes of the country’s largest transporter. 

Until Sunday, the PMO was virtually holding the reins of railways in the absence of an ‘effective’ minister. The administrative machinery also did nothing to realise the goals set by PM Narendra Modi.

Besides ensuring safety and providing quality amenities to passengers, Prabhu’s biggest challenge will be getting the derailed railways back on a sound financial track.

And to achieve that, the most important tasks on his mind will be boosting foreign investment in key infrastructure projects and realising the potential of PPP projects. 

The minister admits that all is not well in the Rail Bhavan. 

At the same time, Prabhu promises: “Within next three years, I will turnaround the Railways in a way that it will become an example of service with high output and efficiency.’’ 

Prabhu knows that his main area of delivery will be expediting stuck projects for which foreign investment is most necessary. Modi has put construction of eight high-speed corridors and semi high-speed corridors as the top priorities to put the Indian Railways in the fast lane. 

“Our two focus areas will be customer service and railway safety,” Prabhu said. 

“We should be part of the solution and not become a part of the problem.’’ 

The buzz is that Prabhu has the mandate from the PMO to cleanse the rot set in the Railway Board functioning. A complete Board restructuring, decentralisation in operational functioning and more powers to zonal offices in day-to-day operations are something one can expect in the next few months.
