Gap Inc. has announced that it will shut down its e-commerce brand Piperlime.

The online retailer, which sells apparel, shoes and accessories from designers such as Michael Kors, Rachel Comey and Kate Spade, represents only 1per cent of the company's $16 billion yearly revenue, the company revealed in a press release on Friday.

'We are incredibly grateful to our fashion-focused, loyal customers, and proud of our dedicated employees who have been working hard to evolve the brand and test out new ideas,' Gap's newly-appointed CEO, Art Peck, said of the decision.

End of an era: Gap Inc. has announced that it will shut down its e-commerce brand Piperlime, which it launched in 2006

Shop talk: The company will turn its focus to reviving struggling sales for its namesake Gap brand, and to increase profits from its other brands, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athletica and Intermix

He added: 'We plan to keep on pushing new ideas and look forward to seeing how we can apply what we’ve learned to the rest of the company as we continue to bring great products and shopping experiences to our customers.'

Mr Peck, who officially starts his new role as CEO on February 1, plans to close all of Piperlime's properties - which include a brick-and-mortar store in New York City, by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2015.

The company will turn its focus to reviving struggling sales for its namesake Gap brand, and to increase profits from its other brands, Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athletica and Intermix.

Mr Peck has also named new global presidents for two of its brands in November; Jeff Kirwan, 48, is now at the helm of Gap, and Andi Owen, 49, has taken over Banana Republic.

Brick-and-mortar: In 2012, the brand opened a 4,000-square-foot store in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood

About face: Efforts to raise Piperlime's profile have included ongoing partnerships with celebrity 'guest editors' such as Rachel Zoe (pictured in 2011 at an event in New York)

Piperlime was launched in 2006 to compete with Amazon's online retailer Zappos. It initially sold only shoes, before expanding into apparel and accessories.

The site was also created in response to Gap customers' requests for the company to sell more footwear.

'Now we're able to dress our customers from head to toe, and that's something they said they wanted,' Gap spokesman Alex Clark told San Francisco Business Times in 2006.

In 2012, the brand opened a 4,000-square-foot store in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood.

Other efforts to raise Piperlime's profile include ongoing partnerships with celebrity 'guest editors' such as Rachel Zoe, Rachel Bilson and Olivia Palermo. The brand also began serving at Project Runway's retail sponsor in 2010.
