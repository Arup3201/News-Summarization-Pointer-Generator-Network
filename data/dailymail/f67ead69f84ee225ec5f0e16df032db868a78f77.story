The England and Wales Cricket Board are set to conduct a 'major review' into the reasons behind the national team's early World Cup exit, although managing director Paul Downton does not expect any changes in the short term.

Coach Peter Moores' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which England were rarely competitive, losing four of their five games, to crash out of the tournament with Friday's final group game against Afghanistan still to play.

Downton has the power in his hands to end Moores' second spell in charge but in the wake of Monday's 15-run defeat to Bangladesh he has so far sought to back the man he described as 'the outstanding coach of his generation' when he appointed him last April.

It is high praise that Downton still believes Moores is worthy despite an unconvincing record, albeit with a remodelled team, soured further by events over the past month.

'As far as his ability is concerned I still feel he is a very high-quality coach, so, no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago,' Downton said.

Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place 

'You don't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen.'

England fly out to the Caribbean for a Test series early next month and while it appears any fall-out from the ECB review is unlikely to strike before then, Downton did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that Moores would remain in charge.

'All I have said is that we're still within the first year of his appointment,' he said.

'We clearly will have a major review of what's happened in the last six months but particularly during the World Cup.

'Everybody is extremely raw from yesterday's experience but we still have a game left in the World Cup, so no decisions are going to be made in the short term.

'In less than a month we will be in the West Indies playing Test cricket so I don't envisage any short-term changes.'

The upcoming review could also leave Downton to feel at some unease.

The 57-year-old was not employed by incoming chairman Colin Graves or Tom Harrison, who was appointed as the ECB's chief executive officer last October.

Downton will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as Monday while England's tournament-ending defeat was ongoing in Adelaide.

'I've worked with Colin Graves on the board for the last year. He's been extremely supportive of everything we've done,' he said.

'Tom has been with us for two months and we've spent a lot of time together. Both have been extremely supportive in what we're doing.'

England fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter's Ashes whitewash and Moores was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of Jonathan Trott, Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen following his well-publicised falling out with the ECB.

The former Lancashire coach has attempted to bring young players through and England's performances immediately suffered as they succumbed to a first-ever home Test series defeat to Sri Lanka.

They bounced back strongly to beat India after falling behind in that series, but since then England have struggled in the one-day arena, losing 18 of 27 games under Moores, and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the World Cup.

'We're in the middle of a very significant rebuilding phase,' Downton said.

'We offered six new central contracts during the summer. My first job when I came in here was to try to re-establish a Test side which we made progress with in the summer.

'The next job was to get to the World Cup with as competitive a side as we could. We always knew we coming from behind.

'All I will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation. Look through history, look at any very successful side which has broken up, how long it takes sometimes to rebuild again.

'I am very confident that in a year's time, in two years' time this group of players will be battle-hardened and will be more competitive.'

While one-day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months, when England will embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 Tests, the ECB will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the World Cup comes to these shores in 2019.

England's senior players are set to be consulted and Downton suggested the possibility of a specific selector for ODIs would be discussed.

Meanwhile, all-rounders Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali are fitness doubts for the match against Afghanistan after they both suffered injuries in the defeat to Bangladesh.

Woakes left the Adelaide Oval with his left foot in a protective boot after feeling pain during his late bid to save England's World Cup while Moeen suffered side injury while bowling. Both players are set to have scans in Sydney on Wednesday.
