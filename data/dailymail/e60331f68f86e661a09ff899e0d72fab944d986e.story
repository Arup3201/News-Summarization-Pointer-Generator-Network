Two murderous rapists will be put to death today at executions in Oklahoma and Florida.

Charles Warner, who raped and killed an 11-month-old baby girl, will today become the first Oklahoma inmate to be put to death since the botched execution of Clayton Lockett.

Lockett writhed on the gurney, moaning and trying to lift his head after he had been declared unconscious, prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony.

The same three-drug method will be used on Warner and Florida death row inmate Shane Kormondy, who shot a man in the head before raping his wife.

Warner, whose execution was delayed by nearly nine months after Lockett's death, will face the lethal injection at 6pm (CST) for raping and killing 11-month-old Adrianna Waller in 1997.

Despite the obvious suffering Lockett went through, the same lethal cocktail of drugs will be used on Warner and Kormondy.

Kormondy, who, along with two accomplices, killed a man in 1993 with a gunshot to the back of his head and raped his wife, will be executed an hour earlier in Florida. 

He wants his sentence to be reduced to life in prison as that is what his accomplices are serving.

Both Oklahoma and Florida plan to start the executions with the sedative midazolam, which was used in Lockett's botched execution.

Midazolam has been challenged in court as ineffective in rendering a person properly unconscious before the second and third drugs are administered, creating a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering.

Attorneys for Oklahoma say a failed intravenous line and a lack of training led to the problems with Lockett's injection, not the drugs.  

Warner and three other death row inmates have filed a petition with the Supreme Court, calling for their executions to be called off.  

Oklahoma's last execution saw murderer Clayton Lockett writhe and moan in the gurney after he was declared unconscious

 The same three-drug method used on Lockett, involving sedative midazolam, will be used on Warner

The appeal states: 'There is a well-established scientific consensus that [midazolam] cannot maintain a deep, comalike unconsciousness.'

Clayton Lockett moaned and tried to lift his head, prompting officials to try to halt the execution before he died in apparent agony

Oklahoma has increased the amount of midazolam to be used by five times to mirror the recipe used in 11 successful executions in Florida.

But the drug was used in other botched executions in Arizona and Ohio last year, where inmates snorted and gasped after lethal injections.  

Oklahoma has ordered new medical equipment such as backup IV lines and an ultrasound machine for finding veins and has renovated the execution chamber with new audio and video equipment to help the execution team spot potential problems.

Last year Shonda Waller, the mother of the raped and murdered baby, told KFOR that she did not want Warner to be executed. 

She said: 'I don’t want to see him to be sentenced to death. 

'If they truly want to honor me then they will do away with the death penalty for him and they will give him life in prison without the possibility of parole because that’s the only thing that’s going to honor me. 

'I don’t see any justice in just sentencing someone to die. 

'To me, the justice is in someone living with what they have done to you to your family, and having to live with that the rest of their life knowing they will never get to walk out those doors.'
