Marilyn Huck, 54, admitted drowning her two kittens on a bucket of water and leaving them on her neighbour's doorstep in a bizarre gesture

A woman has admitted drowning her two kittens in a bucket of water and leaving them on her neighbour's doorstep in a bizarre gesture.

Marilyn Huck, 54, dumped the dead animals outside her neighbour's home in Edmonton, north London, before pointing at the bodies and mouthing 'It's payment of a kind'.

She is due to be sentenced next month after admitting two counts of causing unnecessary distress to animals, changing her plea on what would have been the first day of her trial at Highbury Magistrates Court.

The court was told Huck's pet cat had given birth the kittens, but she had strangled the struggling animals before drowning them in a bucket of water. 

Huck was spotted approaching the home of her neighbour, who was known only as Mrs Coleman, on November 6, 2013.

The two had known each other for a number of years but it is not clear why Huck decided to kill and dump the kittens, the court was told.

'Mrs Coleman saw the defendant approaching her property dragging what was described as a 'granny trolley,' said Alison Armour, prosecuting.

'By the time Mrs Coleman had reached her front door in Montagu Road, Edmonton, north London, Ms Huck was already walking away.

'The defendant turned around and pointed at the kittens lying on the step, and Mrs Coleman started screaming.'

Ms Armour explained the manner in which the bodies were laid out suggested they had been thrown.

The animals were 'soaked through and clearly dead.'

Mrs Coleman called the police and Huck shouted at officers: 'It's payment of a kind.'

'Ms Huck said she [Mrs Coleman] knew what it's about,' Ms Armour continued.

'She then said she had a knife and would kill herself if the officers tried to enter her property.'

The RSPCA were called and took the mother of the kittens away.

When she was questioned Huck said: 'I got annoyed and did that to the cats.'

Highbury Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard Huck  had 'been in a bad place' at the time of the incident

She explained how she had strangled the kittens and then put them in a plastic bag which she had held in a bucket of water for ten minutes.

Huck said she had 'been in a bad place' at the time.

She originally pleaded not guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary distress to animals, but changed her plea on the first day of trial.

'I wish to change my plea and appeal to the court for clemency,' she said.

Huck, of Enfield, was bailed and told not to own or care for any animals before her sentencing, which is due to take place on February 4 after psychiatric reports have been prepared.
