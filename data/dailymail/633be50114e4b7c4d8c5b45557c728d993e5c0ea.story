A high school student who threatened the lives of three of his teachers was found to have an arsenal of weapons at his home.

Matthew Ross, 18, of Twentynine Palms, California, was in possession of firearms, hundreds of rounds of rifle and shotgun ammunition, hunting knives, swords, hatchets and crossbows at his home according to authorities. 

The property was searched after he threatened to 'shoot, stab and assault' staff members at Black Rock High School in Yucca Valley, where he attended.

Deputies say a teacher heard the student threatening to kill three teachers, and those teachers were mentioned specifically by name, reports ABC7.

The suspect was taken into custody at the school earlier today.

'The threat was very real,' San Bernardino County sheriff's Deputy Shaunna Ables told the Los Angeles Times.

'He had the means to carry it out if he wanted to.'

Collection: The young man apparently spent years accumulating the weapons, and recently began buying ammunition 

He had reportedly accumulated the weapons over the past few years and just recently started buying ammunition when he turned 18-years-old. 

The suspect's brother says he didn't mean to hurt anyone, reports ABC7.

'He is temperamental, but he's no threat to society.' James Ross said.

'He's a good kid, he does get angry, we all get angry sometimes.'

Ross was booked into a county jail and held in lieu of $50,000 bail. 

He will be arraigned Friday.
