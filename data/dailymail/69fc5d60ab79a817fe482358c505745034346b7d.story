A middle-aged scientist has gone to great lengths to impress a girl - but unfortunately for him his chat up technique just did cut it.

Wu Lei, 54, from Taiwan, was so keen on 23-year-old Ling Lin he went to the hairdresser and asked for a short back and sides that would help him stand out.

And he got it when his hair was styled into a perfectly right-angled flat top - a bit like a Lego man. With that, he thought he could corner her.

Edgy: Wu Lei, 54, said he had wanted to impress a 23-year-old girl who he had tried to chat up but who had rejected his advances

Unfortunately, it didn't work and Wu's beau rejected his advances.

Ling said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a Lego figure or character from the video game 'Warcraft'.

She added: 'My friends call him blockhead, I can imagine he might have found someone as he had a good and respectable job as a medical laboratory scientist at the National Taiwan University Hospital. But he should act his age.'

Wu who is still single despite the expensive hairdo said: 'I can't understand it. I make an attractive monthly income of TWD 70,000 (£1,400). 

Bit of a square: The young woman, Ling Lin, said the hairdo had made her even more unlikely to respect him as he looked like a lego figure

Cornering her: Wu, who is still single despite the expensive hairdo, said: 'I can't understand it'

'I adopted this hairstyle because I wanted to look like a guy in his 20s or 30s to attract the girl who rejected me. Or in fact any girl.'

Styling his hair was not an easy task. He reportedly needs to use up two cans of gel and spends two hours doing his hair. He can also only comb it once every 15 days to get rid of dead hair.

But the hairdo and the media coverage it attracted has made Wu a hit on the streets, with people pointing out 'Blockhead' to their kids and taking snaps of him.

The famous local comic artist Cherng Li even featured Wu in one of his stories after seeing him on the metro, saying 'I could not get his figure out of my mind, so I had to put it onto paper.'
