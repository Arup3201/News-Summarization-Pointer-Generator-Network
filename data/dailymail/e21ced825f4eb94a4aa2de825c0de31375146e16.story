The current harmony within the England camp in Brazil despite the opening defeat against Italy is not in evidence at St George’s Park.

This follows the surprising departure last weekend of Noel Blake after five years in charge of the England Under 19 team and seven as a national coach.

Upset staff, albeit anonymously, have made strong complaints to Sports Agenda about Blake being made a victim of the new regime at the national training centre under director of elite development Dan Ashworth.

They complain about a cliquey atmosphere, with Ashworth favouring his own appointments including close family friend Aidy Boothroyd as England U20 manager. And Ashworth  and Boothroyd are both in Brazil - the former in a scouting role and the latter as part of a  tournament study group - while long-standing FA coaches are not.

The FA would not comment about allegations of unrest at SGP and Blake gave no indication of any problems in his relationship with the FA in a statement following his exit.

Former Stoke, Birmingham, Leeds and Portsmouth defender Blake, whose England charges have failed to qualify for the European Championship for the last two years, said: ‘It has been a real honour for me to coach the England U18, 19, and 20 teams during the past seven years.

‘The international tournament experience I have gained is invaluable and I had the pleasure of working with some outstanding young English players.’

However the FA’s commitment to increase the number of black managers and coaches is at odds with the departure of Jamaica-born Blake.

After the kicking he received from FA top brass Greg Dyke and David Gill at the Congress, FIFA president Sepp Blatter has chosen not to attend any of England’s group games. And don’t bank on Blatter, who called Dyke’s attack the ‘most disrespectful thing I have experienced in my entire life’, watching England unless they reach the last eight. A FIFA spokeswoman said Blatter was scheduled for ‘different matches’.

Wayne Rooney’s place in the England starting line-up has been a matter of conjecture but the family have no doubts about him playing.

Wife Coleen, kids Kai and Klay plus Coleen’s brother and parents have booked into the Fasano Hotel on Ipanema beach, the most expensive boutique hotel in Rio, and have private jets booked to go to Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte for England’s two remaining group games.

ITV are expecting a peak audience of 20million for the Uruguay game, which would be the highest of the tournament if Roy Hodgson’s side don’t make it of the group.

And ITV are entrusting co-commentary to Andy Townsend, who has a lot more experience in that difficult role than the BBC’s beleaguered Phil Neville. However rival broadcasters have sympathy with Neville’s nightmare display in Manaus that received 445 complaints. They blame BBC bosses for their decision to make that game Neville’s live international debut.

VIPs in stadium chaos

This wing-and-a-prayer tournament has left plenty of disgruntled VIP hospitality customers.English corporates, who have paid £1,500 per match, had the same unsatisfactory experience in both Manaus and the Maracana. Their entry wristbands were collected at the opposite end of the stadium to their hospitality areas and there was no one to direct them.

The chaos at the patently unfinished Porto Alegre Stadium - with dust everywhere and no PA systems  or anthems - was even worse and the corporate areas in Sao Paulo, where England play  on Thursday, are not complete either, with makeshift carpets installed temporarily.

Daniel Sturridge is rapidly turning into the star of the England side on and off the pitch. As well opening his goalscoring account in Manaus, Sturridge has proved to be the most engaging character of the team with the media and charmed the locals on the FA visit to the Rocinha favela with his vibrant personality despite not speaking a word of Portuguese.
