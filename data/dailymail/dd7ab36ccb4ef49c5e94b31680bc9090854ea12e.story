Pop star Boy George vented his anger on Twitter after claiming 'unhelpful' staff at at plus-size clothing store Evans laughed at him as he was buying shoes.

The 51-year-old musician hit out at a 'stroppy/unhelpful' shop assistant after visiting a central London branch to try on some wedges.

He tweeted: 'I'm sure lots of geezers buy women's shoes at Evans? Or is it just me in my beard trying on wedges that's so amusing?'.

The singer and songwriter, who told his 260,000 plus Twitter followers he was 'on one', posted: 'If the stroppy/unhelpful woman at Evans in Marble Arch thinks I'm going to take this lying down! Ha!'.

It appeared a selection of shoes George had bought from the store were too small.

The clothing chain responded to the cross-dressing musician's outraged tweets with an apology and an offer of assistance.

It added it would be contacting the Marble Arch branch about the incident.

'@BoyGeorge We're very sorry to hear this. We'll be contacting our Marble Arch team about this matter. How can we help at all?', Evans wrote.

George, who posted pictures of himself modelling the Evans wedges in black and turquoise, told the store: 'Well, I need my lovely shoes in an 8?'.

Evans sent the shoes to the cross-dressing musician at his home last night, according to a report in the Daily Star.

The Culture Club singer tweeted: 'Thank you very much! I will wear my @evans clothing shoes with major pride!! xxx'.
