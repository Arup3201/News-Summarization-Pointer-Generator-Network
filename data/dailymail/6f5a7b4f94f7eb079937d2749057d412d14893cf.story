The best wildlife photographers from around the world captured these incredible images of beasts and birds in their natural habitat - from Antarctica to Bedfordshire.

The astonishing selection of images of animals across the globe were shortlisted for the Veolia Environment Wildlife Photographer of the Year award.

The winning shot was a beautiful snap of emperor penguins swimming through the icy waters of the Ross Sea in Antarctica.

The image by photographer Paul Nicklen, from Canada, took the top spot in the international competition.

Mr Nicklen spent hours in wait for the penguins to charge to the surface through a rare break in the ice so he could capture this stunning image.

He said: 'It was a fantastic sight as hundreds launched themselves out of the water and onto the ice above me - a moment that I felt incredibly fortunate to witness and one I'll never forget.'

The finalists had snapped a vast 
range of wild animals - from a rare ghost bear sitting down for lunch to a fox being chased by a golden eagle.

The hundred shortlisted images will be on show at the Natural History Museum in London until March 2013.
