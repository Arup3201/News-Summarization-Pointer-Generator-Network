A debate between the two candidates hoping to become Florida's next Governor was delayed last night because one had an electric fan in his podium.

The second televised debate between Governor Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist was held up, as Scott initially refused to take part because the fan inside his opponent's lantern. 

Scott felt it violated the rule prohibiting the use of electric devices.  

The panelists spent a few minutes discussing how they should proceed, with Crist insisting the debate go on without Scott. The governor eventually walked on stage, and Crist kept his fan.

After the initial delay, the candidates debated on a range of issues including gay marriage and Florida's 'stand your ground law' - Crist (pictured) said the law should be amended

The peculiar build up to last night's debate reflects the tension between the two nominees, in what has turned in to a nasty campaign at times. 

After the issue with the fan, the candidates debated on gay marriage - which they disagree on - and Florida's 'stand your ground' law. 

They also discussed how each has handled education and the environment and blamed each other for rising utility costs.

When the candidates were asked if justice was served when neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder for fatally shooting unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin last year, Crist used the opportunity to suggest amending the stand your ground law, which allows use of deadly force if people are in fear for their lives.

'Everyone believes in that American premise and it is the right thing to do to defend yourself and your property,' Crist said. 'But when it gets to the point where you have a statute on the books that allows the instigator...to end up killing another human being after they started the incident, there is something fundamentally wrong with that law.'

Scott said Martin's death was tragic, but the law should remain as it is. 

'I believe in the right to defend yourself. I can't imagine losing a child like that but I have talked to sheriffs and police chiefs,' Scott said. 'I stand with them that we need to have the existing law in place.'

After the debate, Scott's campaign manager Melissa Sellers issued a statement saying, 'Crist can bring his fan, microwave, and toaster to debates - none of that will cover up how sad his record as governor was compared to the success of Rick Scott'

The two candidates stand on opposite sides of a number of key issues, including education funding, same-sex marriage, medical marijuana, Cuba policy and raising the minimum wage

Polls show the two candidates neck and neck in the race in a state that Scott won by only 60,000 votes in 2010

As he has done throughout the campaign, Scott blamed Crist for rising unemployment during the recession and took credit for lower unemployment during the recovery.

'Charlie is the zero-wage governor: 832,000 people went from wages to zero wages when Charlie was governor,' Scott said.

But Crist retorted: 'Rick, there you go again, trying to blame the global economic meltdown on me. It is unbelievable that he would continue to say that, but he says it. And he also says he created all these new jobs all by himself.

'You just can't trust Rick. And it's sad. It's unfortunate.' 

Once the debate got underway a few minutes late both candidates wasted no time attacking each other, despite warnings from the panel that the public was upset with the negativity of the campaign so far

Scott was asked if Florida's constitutional ban on gay marriage was discriminatory, but he refused to directly answer the question, even when asked a second time. He did say he supports traditional marriage.

Crist said he was in favour of gay marriage.

'Who is it for us to tell other people who to love and what is it in our right to tell other people who to marry?' Crist said. 

The 2014 Florida gubernatorial election will take place on November 4.

Incumbent Republican Governor Rick Scott is running for re-election to a second term in office.
