A Norwegian shop has been forced to apologise to children and their families after it packed realistic looking severed plastic hands and feet in butchers' plastic trays and sold them as part of its Halloween collection.

Furious parents were horrified when they discovered the severed limbs in the meat freezers which terrified children looking for Halloween costumes and decorations.

Europris, which has stores across Norway, has now been forced to withdraw the range of fake, shrink-wrapped body parts.

Knut Spaeren, the company's spokesman, said: 'We also didn't want to cause any upset, especially not to children and we are withdrawing the range with immediate effect.'

But the move failed to lessen the storm of protest on Facebook and other social media platforms.

Facebook user Mona Urfjell wrote: 'I think it's such a shame that we have an American tradition so violently forced down our throats.'Â 

Another Gudveig Olsen wrote: 'It's absolutely terrible and it should not be allowed.'

Ivar Larsen added: 'Do we not have enough violence in the country without these kind of crazy people bringing such things into the shops.'

Earlier this month a man who puts up a display of 'disembowelled corpses' outside his home in Hertfordshire was asked to tone it down.

James Creighton, 25, was told that his scene was making children cry with its macabre reconstruction of a scene from The Texas Chainshaw Massacre.

He has put the display up outside his house in Stevenage to raise funds for charity every year since his grandmother died in 2009.

But one parent complained to Hertfordshire Constabulary, concerned that the collection of 'bloody corpses and gory skeletons' was scaring young children.
