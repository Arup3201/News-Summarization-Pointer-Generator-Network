The first time it happened, I was eight years old and on the beach with my father and my best friend, Marnie. Dad suggested a running race, drawing the start line with a piece of wood in the sand.

‘Ready, steady...’ and Marnie was off. My fury at her getting an unjust lead was only fuelled by my father cheering her on, blithely ignoring the fact that she had so blatantly cheated.

She won, of course. And I’ll never forget him saying ‘it’s because she’s taller than you. She’s a better runner.’

Marnie threw me a look — one that clearly said: ‘I’ve got your dad wrapped round my little finger.’

And so she had. It was a fact of my life; something that happened whenever I invited a friend round.

To say that my father, a great raconteur, put on a show for my female friends would be an understatement. From the moment they stepped over the threshold he would turn on the charm, directing all his wit and humour in their direction.

Which was fine. Usually it was me who basked in the glow of his unfailing good nature and I knew how special it made me feel.

Dormant emotions: Her father's actions made Shona so mad that she has only recently acknowledged them again

But when friends came over, his spotlight beamed on them. I’m not suggesting that his behaviour was inappropriate. He wasn’t flirting at this stage. It was more a desire for some sort of adulation from my peers. He would flatter them and bowl them over with his unarguable charisma.

It drove me absolutely mad. So mad, in fact, that it has only taken a recent article in society magazine Tatler to bring all those dormant emotions flooding back three decades on.

In a feature entitled ‘Ten Charm Rules’, the magazine’s teen supplement blatantly encourages girls as young as 13 to flirt with their friends’ fathers, telling them that ‘the big secret to getting on in life’ is to make other people’s parents like you.

The article advises its young readers to ‘take half an hour to flirt (gently) with the parent of the opposite sex and then write a witty thank-you letter — bingo, you’re a winner’. It continues: ‘Word will get out and you’ll be invited everywhere — dinners, more country weekends, swanky holidays and so on, and so on …’

My family didn’t own a country pile or jet off on expensive holidays. But that didn’t stop my friends simpering at my father whenever he happened to stroll into a room. And the older we got, the worse it became.

He didn’t need any encouragement and neither, it seemed, did they. How I wished he would just go away and leave us all alone like other dads did.

And, to my horror, my friends were always more than keen to stop talking to me about Richard Gere or Duran Duran and turn their attention to whatever my father wanted to bore them with — usually, tales of his brief film career (he was a bit-part actor in the Sixties) or some other equally tedious anecdote from his past.

What girl wants her father stealing the limelight? And why couldn’t my friends at least look a little bored?

Stealing the limelight: Shona felt uncomfortable with the attention her friends gave her father

There were other emotions, too, that I couldn’t fully understand.

One of the
 ways Dad would try to impress my friends was by belittling me, making 
me the butt of his jokes. It was always done with a smile and I’m sure 
wasn’t intended to hurt me.

The
 result, however, was that he would make my friends howl with laughter. 
Suddenly, it was them against me and they weren’t yet mature enough to 
put peer loyalty above trying to impress a parent.

Perhaps
 I was just over-sensitive, but I grew to hate the banter. Admittedly it
 made me feel a little jealous but also slightly uncomfortable, as if I 
were a gooseberry on my own play dates.

By
 the time I was 17, my father had turned to open flirtation with one of 
my more attractive schoolfriends. Why, I have no idea. At the time, his 
marriage to my mother seemed happy; perhaps he thought it was funny. At 
any rate, I found it excruciating and so spent a lot of time at my 
friend’s house instead, where her father largely ignored us.

Yet I couldn’t keep my friends and my 
father apart for ever. And to my horror, when I was 18 a pal of mine 
took a shine to my dad.

My parents had recently separated — a decision prompted largely by my mother, who moved out of our five-bedroom home into a one-bedroom flat in a nearby West Sussex village. They were having a rough patch and, looking back, I suspect she was hoping my father would beg her to return.

He didn’t. What he did, however, was mope around feeling understandably sorry for himself. I was home after dropping out of my first year of university and landed myself a junior writer’s job on the local paper, where I befriended an outgoing redhead called Sue.

We had been at the same school, but she was in the year above me, so until then we hadn’t had much to do with each other.

That changed as we bonded over tedious council meetings and my frustrations at the sorry demise of my parents’ marriage as I watched Dad rattling around our home, sorrowfully griddling fish fingers for himself every night.

Forgiveness: Although things improved between Shona and her Dad, she was never able to forgive her friend Sue

Then one night she ended up staying over. I can remember, in the morning, standing on the landing, hearing my Dad tell her a joke in the kitchen — the first time I’d heard him laugh in months. And then glancing towards my parents’ bedroom, its door wide open, duvet askew, the bed clearly slept in on both sides.

The door to the spare bedroom, where Sue should have spent the night, was firmly shut. Who, I remember wondering, shuts a bedroom door when coming out of it in the morning?

I knew that all it would take was for me to turn the handle and look. Then I would see the smooth eiderdown my mother had bought at a craft fair. A bed carefully made up for a friend, but a bed I was convinced had not been slept in.

In that moment I hated both of them. Her for betraying our friendship, and him for crossing a line that I never in a million years thought he would dare to cross.

During the next few days I confronted both of them and they vehemently denied anything had happened. It was only when I popped out one lunchtime to buy my father a birthday present — a new radio alarm clock for his bedside table — and Sue said: ‘Has his other one broken?’ that the truth finally came out.

The look of horror on her face at this slip would almost have been funny if I hadn’t felt so shocked.

To her credit, she did apologise and tried to explain that it was a moment of madness — a one-night stand she deeply regretted. But I felt they had both acted with complete disregard for my feelings, then treated me like an idiot by lying about what had happened.

Part of me felt vindicated — I’d had suspicions all along. But I couldn’t get over this overwhelming sense I’d been let down in the worst possible way. It was supposed to be Sue and me sharing secrets, not Sue and my father.

I tried to continue living with Dad and to see things from his point of view. He was having a crisis, fair enough. But he never once said sorry.

Eventually, things just became too difficult at home and I decided to move out and rent a room in a house with people my own age. I still saw Sue at work, but we no longer socialised. I just couldn’t get over the image of her having sex with my dad.

Daughters of her own: Because of her experiences Shona is more aware how her own husband acts around her teenage daughters' friends (Shona's dad pictured with one of Shona's daughters, then aged two)

Of course, we were all adults by this stage and you might argue that I had no good reason to feel so wronged. Yet it is still hard to explain how devastated I felt.

Things with my Dad did, eventually, improve — you can’t choose your family, after all. But I chose to avoid Sue and haven’t spoken to her for years.

Now I have two teenage daughters of my own and I suppose it’s natural that I am more aware of how my husband, Keith, behaves around their friends.

Thankfully, he pays very little attention. I’m sure they view him as middle-aged and dull. Which is as it should be.

I hope teenage girls will take Tatler’s terrible advice with a pinch of salt — not just because hair-flicking and batting one’s eyes at a friend’s father is deeply uncool, but because even if your friend looks as if she doesn’t care, it will matter to her very much indeed. Trust me, I should know.
