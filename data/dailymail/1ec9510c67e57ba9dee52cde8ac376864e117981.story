A man punched a one-year-old girl in the face after having sex with her mother because the baby would not stop crying for her mom who was taking a shower.

Markeese Cummings, 24, told Ohio police that he lost his temper when the baby 'continued crying for her mother' and he punched the child with a closed fist 'causing serious physical harm'.

The incident occurred on Monday evening when  Cummings, of Toledo, visited the home of the 20-year-old mother of the young victim.

Investigators heard that the mom took her daughter into a different room so she and Cummings could have privacy, The Smoking Gun reported. 

Cummings and the baby's mother both informed investigators that 'they are sexual partners only', according to Detective Lawrence Anderson.

After having sex, the mother had a shower while Cummings went downstairs to get a drink, taking the baby with him. When she would not stop crying for her mother, Cummings struck the little girl on the right side of her face.

The exact injuries inflicted on the one-year-old were not made public, but Cummings was charged with felonious assault and bail was initially set at $75,000.
