Chef Simon Rogan's restaurant L'Enclume has been ranked the best in Britain for the second year running by an influential guide.

The Cumbrian eatery won a perfect 10 cooking score alongside two other restaurants, Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, the first time in 15 years that the Good Food Guide to Britain's top restaurants awarded three full marks simultaneously.

In 1999, that honour was shared by Marco Pierre White's Oak Room, Nico Ladenis at Chez Nico and female chef Gunn Eriksen at the Altnaharrie Inn at Loch Broom, Ullapool, in Scotland.

Simon Rogan's restaurant L'Enclume was voted the best in the country for the second year running, now the 45-year-old chef has taken over the running of the prestigious restaurant in Claridges, in London 

Simon Rogan wowed judges from the Good Food Guide with his inventive cooking such as these carrots

In another first, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay chef proprietor Clare Smyth became the first female chef in 15 years to be awarded a perfect 10 score by the guide, now in its 64th year.

The Fat Duck, ranked second, has now scored a perfect 10 for seven years in a row - longer than any other restaurant since the guide adopted its current scoring system.

Restaurant Gordon Ramsay achieved third place, up two places from last year.

The guide's consultant editor Elizabeth Carter said: 'After a break of a decade, Gordon Ramsay's Chelsea flagship has once again been awarded a perfect 10.

Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire also was commended by judges 

'Now the domain of Clare Smyth, with support from what is without doubt one of the best front-of-house teams in the UK, this most impressive of London's premier restaurants is back in that elite club.

'Further congratulations, too, for Smyth is the first female chef to achieve our top score in 15 years. With her brilliantly artistic, elegant, modern French cooking she perfectly complements the witty, cerebral Fat Duck and the sensual farm-to-table delights of L'Enclume at the pinnacle of our top 50 list.'

Rogan said he felt 'so privileged to be at the number one spot for a second year'.

He said: 'The full 10 rating really is a reflection of all the continued focus and improvements we have been undertaking at L'Enclume every single month.

'The team just keeps on getting stronger and stronger, and we now also have a hugely skilled front-of-house staff who more than match our culinary standards.'

Cornwall's Restaurant Nathan Outlaw took fourth spot followed by Claude Bosi's Mayfair restaurant Hibiscus.
