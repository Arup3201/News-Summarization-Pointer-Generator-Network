Gay clergy in civil partnerships can become bishops, following an apparent U-turn from the Church of England.

Despite rejecting proposals to allow women to become bishops, a new ruling means homosexual men can be appointed as long as they remain chaste and repent for any past sexual acts.

The Right Reverend Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, released a statement on behalf of the Church yesterday, saying it would be ‘unjust’ to exclude them if they were ‘living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality’.

However the decision was attacked from all sides, with conservative Anglicans determined to resist it while those campaigning for the church to recognise gay rights were unconvinced it would work.

The issue has split the established Church since 2003 when gay cleric Jeffrey John was made Bishop of Reading, but forced to step down after protests.

Now in a chaste civil partnership and serving as Dean of St Albans, he would be allowed to apply for another post.

Clergy have been allowed to enter chaste civil partnerships since 2005.

Bishops were not technically banned, but the issue of civil partnerships was shelved until 18 months ago when Church officials began considering it.

Religious commentators say the House of Bishops, which is responsible for doctrine, may have been nervous about rejecting openly gay bishops on legal grounds.Yesterday’s statement said: ‘The House has confirmed that clergy in civil partnerships, and living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality, can be considered as candidates for the episcopate. ’Conservatives said it would undermine the Church’s opposition to gay marriage, for which it has been granted an exemption from government legislation.

Prebendary Rod Thomas of the group Reform warned that it would be even more divisive than women bishops.

He told the BBC: ‘If you thought that was a furore, wait to see what 
happens the first time a bishop in a civil partnership is appointed.’

The Rev Colin Coward, director of Changing Attitude, which campaigns for
 the church to fully accept people of any sexual orientation, said he 
welcomed the House of Bishops’ decision.

But he added: ‘I don’t believe they are serious about opening the door to someone in a civil partnership becoming a bishop.

‘I would only believe they are serious when it happens.’
