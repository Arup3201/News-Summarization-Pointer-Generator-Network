The family of a Bristol woman killed on holiday in France by a parasite-ridden historic tree has been paid £86,000 in compensation.

Carolyn Thorpe, 62, was enjoying a cup of coffee outside a cafe in Hiers-Brouage, a seaside town in south-west France, when the 20-foot tree toppled and crushed her to death in 2007.

Her daughter Sarah Wright was also injured by the American ash tree, which was planted 200 years ago to mark the birth of Napoleon I's first son.

The 200-year-old ash tree was planted to celebrate the birth of Napoleon I's first son. An investigation after the tragic accident found it was ridden with parasites that had rotted the wood and made it very unstable

The town hall of Hiers-Brouage has now paid more than €100,000, or £86,000, in compensation for the tragic accident. 

It was found the tree had been weakened by parasites making it dangerously unstable, French website The Local reports. 

Of the sum, Ms Wright received €42,000 (£30,400) while €77,000 (£55,600) was paid out for Ms Thorpe's death.

The American ash tree - which was kept as a historical monument within the small town - was between six and seven metres high and measured 13 feet in diameter.

When contacted by press agency AFP the current Mayor of Hiers-Brouage refused to comment. 

At the time of the accident the then-Mayor was reported as saying: 'Everyone thought that [the tree] would hold on for a while longer.'
