LL Cool J's July 31 gig at Rikers Island jail was organized by Department of Corrections officials to reward 'good behavior' by prisoners

Inmates at New York's largest jail are regularly treated to gigs by hip hop stars as a reward for 'good behavior'.

LL Cool J and Treach from Naughty by Nature are among big-name rap performers to have played for convicts at the prison.

The  shows, which were supposed to be kept secret, have come to light just a day after it was revealed that escape artist David Blaine performed for criminals at Manhattan Detention Complex.

A source told the New York Post: 'It takes [criminals'] mind off other things.'

At the LL Cool J show on July 31, young troublemakers were asked to join the star on stage. 

'One inmate assisted him in back vocals on a song,' the source said.

Earlier this year, Treach  also performed at the jail, which sits in the East River between Queens and the Bronx.

Treach, born Anthony Criss, spent a night at a separate prison in Hudson County, New Jersey, shortly before the gig at the New York jail.

A spokesman for the Department of Corrections said celebrities put on the shows for free and are brought in to give prisoners some 'positive reinforcement'.

'The Department of Correction uses positive reinforcement as one of many strategies to reduce inmate idleness and improve facility safety,' he said.

'Their appearances are geared toward violence reduction, and inmates who attend these events do so as a reward for good behavior.'

The Rikers Island prison, only accessible by one bridge, holds up to 15,000 convicts and suspects awaiting trial

But jailhouse performances can end badly. In 2006, a Rikers Island show by rapper Papoose set off a wave of violence, including eight  stabbings. 

The island jail complex houses up to 15,000 inmates at any one time.

Convicts held there are usually serving sentences of less than one year, along with suspected criminals who cannot afford or who have not been given bail.

The jail is similar to the infamous former prison on Alcatraz Island, in San Francisco, because of its relative isolation. Rikers Island is, however, connected to the mainland by a single bridge.

Johnny Cash played two shows at Folsom State Prison, California, in 1968 as a follow-up to his 1955 hit Folsom Prison Blues. A live album of the shows had sold more than three million copies by 2003.

Late rapper Mac Dre recorded vocals for an album over the phone from jail in 1992 while awaiting trial. He was later sentenced to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit robbery. 

The Sex Pistols, who toured the U.S. in 1978 after a long battle to obtain visas, played a one-off gig at a high security prison in Chelmsford, Essex, Britain. 500 inmates enjoyed the 1976 show. 

English singer-songwriter Billy Bragg formed Jail Guitar Doors, an initiative to provide musical instruments to prisons to help convicts rehabilitate themselves.

Yesterday it emerged that the world's most prominent illusionist, magician and escape artist, David Blaine, had performed at Manhattan Detention Complex.

There were anxious faces among prison guards when David Blaine teasingly showed dangerous criminals how to break out of prison during an intimate performance.  

The daredevil, who usually charges around $100 for tickets, performed some of his most famous tricks in front of a crowd of prisoners including rival Bloods and Crips members, according to the New York Post.

One inmate is said to have asked the 41-year-old illusionist to autograph copies of his court papers while another requested he use his powers to make the bars from his cell disappear.
