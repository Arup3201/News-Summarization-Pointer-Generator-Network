Desirable suburban areas with sky-high house prices suffer from a disproportionate number of burglaries, a survey of household thefts has revealed.

Chorlton, in Greater Manchester, home to a large number of upmarket shops and bars, has more burglaries than anywhere else in Britain, with almost one in 20 people saying they have suffered a home invasion.

Herne Hill and Muswell Hill, well-heeled suburbs of London where the average house price is more than £600,000, came second and third on the list of the country's top 20 burglary hotspots.

Burglary capital: London had the highest rate of burglaries with 12 out of the 20 worst areas

Hotspots: All of the top 10 postcodes were in cities, but 20th-placed was in Buckinghamshire

A spokesman for MoneySupermarket.com, which compiled the figures, said that burglars like to target wealthy areas as homes there are more likely to have desirable objects to steal.

Its staff examined more than three million insurance quotes for burglary over the course of a year, noting where and when people declared they had been burgled before.

The M21 postcode was the worst-hit with 45.2 claims per thousand people, or one in 22.

SE24, in south London, was close behind - followed by the leafy north London suburb of Muswell Hill, home to middle-class icons like opera singer Lesley Garrett.

Low crime: The area with the lowest number of burglaries was Basingstoke in Hampshire

More than half the postcodes on the 
top 20 list were from London, including trendy neighbourhoods in the 
east of the city such as Dalston, Hackney and Stoke Newington.

Perhaps most surprisingly of all, the number 20 spot was taken by a clutch of sleepy towns in Buckinghamshire.

Out
 of all 20 postcodes featured on the list, all but three have house 
prices which are higher than the national average of £176,000, according
 to data from property website Zoopla.

Suburban: But Chorlton-cum-Hardy in Manchester is the UK's worst burglary hotspot

Some relatively rural areas proved to be the safest spots in Britain - the Hampshire towns of Basingstoke, Chandler's Ford and Havant topped a list of the postcodes with the fewest burglaries.

Bideford in Devon, the East Riding of Yorkshire and beauty spots on the Scottish coast were also listed among the least crime-ridden areas.

Kevin Pratt, from MoneySupermarket, said: 'While the M21 postal district in Manchester is the country's most notorious burglary claim hotspot, it is London that dominates the top 20 rankings.

'But just because somewhere is named a claim hotspot, it doesn't actually mean the area in question is not a nice place to live.

'Thieves often target areas with wealthy residents and desirable properties where the rewards are potentially greater or quieter areas where they think there is less risk of being caught red-handed.'
