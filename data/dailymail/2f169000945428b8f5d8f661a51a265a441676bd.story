British scientists are calling for anorexia sufferers to join a ground-breaking study to find the genes that may cause the condition.

Researchers from King’s College London have joined forces with experts from around the world in  an effort to prove that victims are born with the illness.

Anorexia affects about 1.6 million people in Britain alone.

In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King’s has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers.

Their target is 25,000 DNA samples worldwide, including 1,000 volunteers from Britain.

Brooks Newmark, the Minister for Civil Society, who last year revealed that he had suffered from anorexia, has already donated his DNA.

The global project, called AN25K, was launched by Cynthia Bulik,  a professor in the field of eating disorders at the University of  North Carolina.

After carrying out research into anorexia in twins in 2007, she discovered that the illness can be inherited, and that more than half the risk of developing the disorder is due to genetic factors.

She said: ‘We know very little about the biology of anorexia and hopefully by identifying these genes we will be able to develop new treatments. It is not just one gene – it will be hundreds of genes.’

The UK research is backed by the charity Charlotte’s Helix, set up in memory of Charlotte Bevan, a farmer’s wife who died aged 48 in January. Her daughter Georgie was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12.

Charlotte rapidly became aware of the stigma associated with the illness and was frustrated by the lack of scientific research being done.

She was convinced that her daughter’s eating disorder was in her DNA and that Georgie had not chosen to be anorexic.

After
 being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Charlotte wrote a book on 
anorexia designed to help parents. She also founded the charity to 
collect the DNA of anorexia sufferers and fund research into the 
illness.

In
 her book, Throwing Starfish Across The Sea, Charlotte wrote: ‘I want 
people to stop being afraid  and ashamed of something that is not their 
fault. I want to educate the 99 per cent of the world that don’t know or
 don’t care that the eating disorder world deserves a voice.

‘I
 want people to know that my daughter is not a vain, mindless bimbo who 
just wants to be thin, but a stellar, brilliant, important part of the 
community who just happens to have a brain blip.’

Gerome
 Breen, a senior lecturer at King’s, is leading the AN25K project. He 
said: ‘What we want to discover is are genetics and biology behind the 
illness, because if we can find the biology behind the illness, we can 
design specific treatments. We want to help sufferers survive.’

Erica Husain, a friend of Charlotte and chairman of the charity, said: ‘We knew we were going to keep this going for her. We wanted to find a way to carry research forward, to bring this research to the UK and put Charlotte’s name on it.’

She added: ‘There are still a lot of myths and tales and this is something  that can give us some reality, some science. People will then understand that an eating disorder is not an illness of choice.’

The research has been backed by Britain’s leading centre for eating disorders, the Eating Disorders Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, which is part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.

Janet Treasure, the unit’s director, said: ‘The research looking at interactions between genes and the environment is invaluable because it does take away a bit of the guilt and confusion from families who are dealing with eating disorders.’

Charlotte’s Helix has no government funding and relies on donations to pay for DNA samples to be taken.

If they find the biology behind the disease they can better treat sufferers

The research has been called 'invaluable' as it will take away the stigma
