Creed front man Scott Stapp believes he is an undercover CIA agent charged with assassinating President Obama, his worried family told a 911 dispatcher.

Recently back home after a 72-hour psychiatric hold in Florida last last month, 41-year-old Stapp took off on a bicycle and disappeared - which caused his panicked wife and sister-in-law to phone the police to try and get them to commit him again.

'He thinks he's part of the CIA,' said Jaclyn Strapp to the dispatcher. 'He thinks they're trying to kill him, and he has a bunch of paperwork in his backpack that he's a CIA agent and he is supposed to assassinate Obama', said her sister.

Troubled: Creed frontman Scott Stapp has reportedly threatened to kill President Obama and fled his home on a bike - worrying his wife Jaclyn (right) who phoned 911

They implored the dispatcher to get an officer after Stapp, who was cycling shirtless around his Florida neighborhood, carrying a backpack of tools and 600 pages of CIA documents he printed from the Internet.

'He's off the drugs, and he's going crazy,' said Jaclyn Strapp's sister to the 911 dispatcher according to TMZ.

However, while on his bike, the star decided to phone 911 himself. He told police that his wife had stolen his truck and reduced him to using the bike.

But, when police found him they decided he was in control of his faculties and declined to commit him.

In November, Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video post.

'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of god, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck,' the 41-year-old rocker admitted on camera.

'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.'

The Grammy winner - whose net worth was once $10M - sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday.

'All hell broke loose' around two months ago when the IRS audited Scott's record company and personal finances.

'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless,' Stapp stated.

'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, "Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months." I don't understand how that's fair America.'

Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook on Friday saying it was his 'last statement' 

The With Arms Wide Open hitmaker also claimed 'someone' used his passwords to transfer all the money out of his bank accounts.

'A lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me, or royalties not paid,' Scott continued.

'There are people that have taken advantage and stolen money from me and they're trying to spread vicious lies and discredit me.'

And at the end of the month, Jaclyn Stapp had her estranged husband admitted to a substance abuse facility.

The former Miss New York USA beauty queen claimed her husband has been using several drugs and threatened to kill himself and harm his family.

Jaclyn said he left their home in early October.

'It is a very painful and personal matter for the family,' said Jason Brodie, Jaclyn Stapp's attorney.

'Jaclyn loves Scott very much. It is now apparent the seriousness of Scott's health. Jaclyn has taken all the necessary steps to help him,' Brodie said.

'She previously arranged for the appropriate treatment and will continue to try and help him. Her primary concern remains the best interest of their children. Jaclyn asks for privacy for her and her children during this difficult time,' the attorney added.

The couple married eight years ago and have three children.
