A lovesick 13-year-old Texas girl who took her brother’s car and drove almost 800 miles to visit a 12-year-old boy she met online is now heartbroken and fears that everything ‘Dylan’ told her was lies.

Meanwhile Beth Robinson’s parents are relieved that their daughter didn’t find ‘Dylan’ who might have been a sexual predator.

On Thursday, Beth was just 130 miles away from where she planned to meet ‘Dylan’ when she was stopped by a state trooper who noticed that the car she was driving matched the description included in an Amber Alert which had been issued for her.

But it is still not clear whether 
‘Dylan’, who Beth met on the Internet through the Xbox video game Call 
of Duty in March, is the 12-year-old boy he said he was.

Runaway: Robinson, 13, was found safe after driving hundreds of miles away from home to meet with a boy she has been communicating with online  

‘We're
trying to confirm that the person was on the other end was actually a 
12-year-old,’ Beth’s mother, Tressa Robinson, told ABC News. 'There were
texts and voicemails sent by him, and they're very alarming.'

The 13-year-old girl was reported missing Thursday after her mother said she had crept out of her bedroom the night before.

Beth,
who was described as naive and sheltered, fled in her brother's 2011 
brown Nissan Versa having taken her mother’s debit card.

She didn’t take her cellphone on her road trip so there was no way of contacting her, her parents told ABC.

Beth had left a note saying that she 
was running away to a girlfriend’s house because of bullies at school, 
and threatening to kill herself.

But after searching through Beth’s texts messages and voicemails, the parents discovered ‘Dylan’.

Her
petrified parents quickly determined that their daughter was likely 
headed to his home 921 miles away in Hodgenville, Tennessee.

Robbie Robinson, Beth’s dad, then 
leapt into his car to chase his daughter as police worked to track the 
missing teenager down too.

Authorities began tracking Elizabeth’s travels through her mother’s debit card. She used it on Thursday in Henderson, Texas.

According
to WSMV, Trooper Dwayne Stanford received an alert that the runaway 
teen had been seen in Hope, Arkansas, at around 2pm Thursday. He 
calculated that she would be headed his way about 10pm or 11 pm.

Around her expected arrival time, the officer pulled into a median and decided to wait. As
Stanford predicted, Elizabeth drove by him on Interstate 40 outside of 
Nashville around 10.24pm.

He immediately activated his emergency lights 
to pull her over and the runaway was later handed her over to her father.

But she was still determined to go and
find ‘Dylan’, so Robbie Robinson agreed to take his daughter to find 
him believing that if he didn’t she could try and find him on her own 
again.

Relieved: Robbie and Tressa Robinson are relieved that their daughter never met up with 'Dylan' who may have been a sexual predator

However, when they couldn’t the home 
that Dylan said he lived in after hours of searching, Beth agreed to 
give up and the two headed home.

Now the 13-year-old is devastated that ‘Dylan’ could have been lying to her the whole time.

‘Dylan’ told her that he would even 
walk to her home in Cypress to see her, said that she could stay at his 
home in Hodgenville and said that his grandmother was aware of her trip.

‘I'm starting to have my doubts. I'm 
really scared. I don't know what type of situation she would have found 
herself in,’ Tressa Robinson told ABC.

The mother thinks that Beth must have 
had help to come up with her elaborate escape plan, especially the idea 
to change the car’s licence plates.

The parents have yet to decide on a 
punishment for Beth but said that she will not be allowed to use her 
Facebook anymore and will not be allowed to play her Xbox  in her 
bedroom.

They also plan for Beth to have counselling so she understands she dangers she was in and the torment her family went through.

Beth is not facing any charges, her parents confirmed.
