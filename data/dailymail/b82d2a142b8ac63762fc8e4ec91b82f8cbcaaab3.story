Extradition: Amanda Knox (appearing on NBC News' Today show in September 20, 2013) could be sent to Italy to serve her 28 year and 6 month sentence if the Italian supreme court upholds her guilty conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher

American authorities could have no choice but to hand over Amanda Knox to Italy if her latest appeal fails according to a Harvard law professor - but the ultimate decision still lies with President Obama and his administration.

Following her conviction on Thursday by an Italian appeals court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, Knox, 26, faces a nervous wait to see if the nation's supreme court upholds her sentence of 28-years and six-months.

If it does, Italy would then have to seek her extradition under the terms of a 1983 treaty - which would then have to be approved or rejected by US Secretary of State John Kerry and forwarded to the US Department of Justice for processing.

However, if the conviction is upheld, Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard University believes that the United States would have little choice but to send her to Italy to serve her sentence.

'The United States seeks extradition of more people than any country in the world. We’re trying to get NSA leaker Edward Snowden back and we’re not going to extradite someone convicted of murder?' he told NBC News.

Indeed, even if Secretary Kerry and President Obama refused to extradite the US citizen then Knox would then face the prospect of becoming a virtual prisoner inside America.

If she left the country she would be continually under the threat of arrest and deportation to Italy if she travelled to any country with an extradition treaty with Rome.

That list currently includes Western Europe, Australia, most of South America and Canada.

So far the State Department has refused to be drawn on a position regarding the outcome of the Knox re-trial.

Spokesman Patrick Ventrell was asked in March last year what would be the likely decision and only offered that the verdict was still months away.

'We can’t really comment beyond that,' Mr Ventrell told reporters according to the Daily Telegraph. 'We never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases.'

In the immediate aftermath of Thursday's guilty verdict, many legal commentators and Knox's own legal team have consoled themselves with the notion that she is protected under the concept of double jeopardy - which is enshrined in the US Constitution.

That means she could not be tried on the same charge twice.

But, the US-Italy extradition treaty protects US citizens from prosecution in Italy only against crimes of which the defendant has been tried under in the United States' legal system.

This is not the case with Knox - who has gone through three trials, all in Italy.

Furthermore, Dershowitz doubts if Knox even qualifies for double jeopardy because she was found guilty first and her acquittal was heard in an intermediate appeals court.

'If that happened in the U.S., it wouldn't be double jeopardy,' he said.

This high profile case though, brings a particular set of problems for the Obama administration because of the high emotions if elicits on both sides of the Atlantic - not just in Italy and America, but in the United Kingdom too.

The United States and Italy enjoy a successful extradition relationship, with cooperation high on busting organised crime.

Tough decision: Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama administration would be responsible for either approving or denying an extradition request by the Italian government for Amanda Knox

It would cause a potential diplomatic row should the president and John Kerry choose not to send Knox to Italy if her appeal fail.

However, on the flip side, Italy may choose not to anger their most powerful ally over such an emotive case.

Knox herself has said that she would not return to Italy and that would only do so, 'kicking and screaming.'

Regardless, any decision on whether to extradite the 26-year-old from the U.S. is likely months away, at least. Experts have said it's unlikely that Italy's justice ministry would request Knox's extradition before the verdict is finalized by the country's high court.

If the conviction is upheld, a lengthy extradition process would likely ensue, with the U.S. State Department ultimately deciding whether to turn Knox back over to Italian authorities to finish serving her sentence.
