Who shot the victims, should police have gone in earlier and why didn't authorities negotiate with Man Haron Monis to release hostages are all questions that will be examined at an inquest into the Sydney siege in two weeks' time.

The NSW Coroner has fast-tracked the inquiry into the fatal Lindt cafe stand-off which resulted in the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson, barrister Katrina Dawson and injuries suffered by some of the 18 hostages Man Haron Monis held for more than 16 hours from the morning of December 15.

The inquest will open on Thursday, January 29 to determine 'how the deaths occurred, the factors that contributed to them and whether they could have been prevented', a spokesman for the NSW Coroner's Court said.

Did they act too late? The inquest into the Sydney siege will determine whether Tactical Operations Unit officers (pictured) stormed the cafe too late or that in the interests of saving lives their timing was right

How exactly did they die? The NSW Coroner will examine ballistics evidence to determine whether rounds or a ricochet from semi automatic police weapons fatally wounded 38-year-old Sydney barrister Katrina Dawson (left) and if Tori Johnson (right) was killed by Man Monis' shotgun

What really went on? Many questions remain for the coroner to decide what actually occurred inside the Lindt cafe (pictured a day after the siege ended) and what could be done differently to prevent its reoccurrence

Who shot him dead? The death of Han Maron Monis (pictured) in a hail of police gunfire is not doubted and while some would not care, but the NSW Coroner will examine ballistics to determine which shots killed the gunman

The inquest may be held at one of Sydney's two coroner's courts - in the inner western suburb of Glebe, where Monis's body was taken following his death at the siege's end, and at Westmead 26 kilometres from the city centre.

However,  NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes will determine over the next fortnight how large a venue is needed for the number of witnesses required, including lawyers representing victims and police officers.

Following his determination on what happened inside the Lindt cafe, Mr Barnes will make recommendations to governments and other agencies to protect future public health and safety.

Did he act alone? Man Haron Monis (pictured behind the Lindt cafe window soon after taking command of the cafe on the morning of December 15) may not have been a lone wolf and the coroner will examine if anyone else was involved in planning his deadly attack

What happened inside? The inquest into the siege will find exactly what went on during the 16 hours, how hostages escaped (pictured) and why others remained inside until the violent end around 2am on day two

These are the questions that the community urgently needs to be answered:

1. How did barrister Katrina Dawson die? Reports that the 38-year-old mother of three died when struck by a police bullet which may have ricochet when the Tactical Operations Unit officers stormed the cafe will be investigated. Ms Dawson reportedly suffered a heart attack, perhaps as a result of bleeding heavily from her wounds.

2. How did cafe manager Tori Johnson die? The Coroner will examine whether Mr Johnson, 34, was shot from behind by hostage taker Man Haron Monis's shotgun

3. How did Man Haron Monis die? The gunman was shot dead by police semi-automatic weapons, but the coroner will examine ballistics to determine how many rounds and from what direction the fatal bullets came.

Who injured the hostages? Four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds, which will come under the investigator's microscope at the hearing

Did he intend to die? Speculation has been rife that Man Haron Monis (pictured) planned to die to avoid prison for sexual assault and murder related offences, but the inquest will determine his intent 

Did he have bombs? After Monis wore a supposedly loaded backpack into the Lindt cafe and told hostages he had planted bombs, explosive experts (pictured, above) attended the siege but it is not yet known whether the claims were a hoax

4. What caused the injuries of the hostages? Four or more of the hostages as well as police suffered injuries including gunshot wounds to the leg and facial wounds, which will come under the investigator's microscope at the hearing.

5. Did the police act properly in holding off, or should they have gone in earlier? There has been much speculation as to whether NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione's senior command should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege, whether that would have caused more or less loss of life and if it is true that military troops such as specially trained SAS soldiers should have been called into assist.

6.  Were there explosives in the backpack worn by Monis and, as he claimed, planted around the cafe and the Sydney CBD? And where and how did the gunman obtain the shotgun and any explosives that may have been present?

Could lives have been saved? There has been much speculation as to whether NSW Police  should have stormed the cafe earlier in the siege, whether that would have caused more or less loss of life including that of victim Katrina Dawson (pictured, on the order of service for her funeral)

Should troops have been called in? The inquest should settle whether troops such as the elite trained SAS should have been called in  to forgo a bloody end for hostages (pictured) shot after the 16 hour siege

7. Did Man Haron Monis intend to die? Public speculation about gunman Monis's intentions, given pending prosecutions against him over sexual assault and murder related charges and a failed court appeal over his hate campaign against Australian soldiers appear to have concluded he intended to die in a fainal blaze of 'glory' in the siege. The Coroner will examine correspondence and social media posts ot determine Monis's intentions.

8. Should police have responded to Monis's demands - for an ISIS flag and audience with Prime Minister Tony Abbott - in exchange for hostages and should offers by Islamic leaders and lawyers to negotiate with him been accepted? Coroner Barnes will sift through the facts of the police response to the situation hour by hour until the siege's end.

9. Did anyone else know about Monis's plans for the siege and is there footage of him casing the premises? Were there other individuals who knew about the siege and who may have helped in planning it? Computer records will help determine whether Monis was alone in planning the siege.

What will the hostages say? Lawyers for the hostages and police involved in the Martin Place siege will pack a courtroom for the inquest into the bloody incident which starts on January 29 and runs for several weeks

What are the lessons to be learned? In the aftermath of the Sydney siege at Martin Place, many unknowns remained as people paid their respects with flowers (pictured) but a public inquest should answer the questions

10. What could have been done to prevent the action taken by Man Haron Monis and what lessons can authorities learn to stop another siege in the future? Despite a high security alert by police and other authorities across NSW and other states over Islamic State related activities, Monis slipped through the net, and the Coroner will be looking at what measures - including greater security around public places which don't have iconic status like the Harbour Bridge or Opera House -  might prevent a repeat incident in the interests of community safety.

Another question is should ASIO have nabbed Monis years ago? Hindsight would say yes, that Monis should never have been taken off Australia's national security body's watch list years ago and, much like another Iranian mullah Mansour Laghaei, should have been deported back to his home country.

Although the NSW Coroner's findings will feed into the wider investigation, this is a question for a Federal Government inquiry into the siege.

Day one of the inquest will hear from the coroner and counsel assisting, who will outline the specific issues into which the inquiry will delve.
