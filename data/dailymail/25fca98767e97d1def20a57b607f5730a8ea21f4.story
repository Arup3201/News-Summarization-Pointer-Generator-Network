When the Avengers Assemble call was sent out by the daughter of a cancer patient who has just weeks to live, the Hollywood stars of the hit movie were quick to respond.

Sophie Caldecott has been harnessing the power of social media to help fulfill the dying wish of her father and superhero fan Stratford, who is in the final weeks of terminal prostate cancer.

The 60-year-old, who has collected comics since he was a little boy, now has back up from Thor, Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk, thanks to a successful Twitter campaign.

Nearly every member of cast in Captain America: The Winter Soldier - including Robert Downey Jr and Samuel L Jackson - has assembled to help Ms Caldecott give her father a unique send off.

She got the idea for the #CapForStrat campaign after her father joked that he was clinging on to see the latest Marvel film, which isn't due to be released on DVD until August.

He had been too ill to watch it at a movie theater.

At first Ms Caldecott, who lives in Oxford, England, with her American husband Greg, and their baby, had just planned to ask Marvel to send the family an advance copy.

With that mission accomplished, she decided to take matters one step further, and started tweeting the celebrity cast to see if they would take selfies and send them to her dad.

'As Agent Coulson would say, it’s time to call for backup. Let’s give him the send off he deserves,' she tweeted, according to SCPR.

True to their super-hero alter egos, the cast of the film have responded to her request, with Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, and Ming-Na Wen, who plays Melinda May in Agents of Shield, rallying the troops.

'It’s been a bit like a massive flash mob where a whole bunch of strangers hug each other,' Ms Caldecott, who writes the Something For A Rainy Day blog, said.

The 26-year-old has managed to get selfies of nearly the entire cast, with only one major character - Black Widow Scarlett Johansson left to track down.

Originally, Mr Caldecott's family had 
planned to surprise him with the full set, but when he hit a low point 
at the hospital, they revealed their Marvel plan to lift his spirits.

Ms Caldecott says she has been grateful for the star support, especially with Jackson who promotes a men's cancer charity One For the Boys, and Hulk actor Ruffalo, helping to raise awareness.

'[The Hulk] was exposed to too much 
radiation, and his superpower/giant green problem is due to his cells 
multiplying out of control,' Sophie said.

'[Scientist]  Banner’s efforts to find a 
cure are a poignant parallel to our efforts to find a cure for prostate 
cancer over the past few years.'

With nearly an entire cast of super heroes coming to her father's aid, Ms Lippiatt is now trying to use her campaign to raise awareness for cancer charities.

Reporting for duty: Agent May, played by Ming-Na Wen in Agents of SHIELD also joined in the campaign
