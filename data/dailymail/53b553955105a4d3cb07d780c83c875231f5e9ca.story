She is a fashion designer, charity ambassador and mother-of-four. But despite her hectic schedule, Victoria Beckham always manages to look immaculate. 

So what's her secret? Regular oxygen facials, workouts nearly every day and plenty of fish, explains the svelte star.

Victoria has revealed that she keeps her skin in check with the help of products and techniques created by dermatologist Dr Harold Lancer - who also advises Kim Kardashian West on how to care for her skin.

Her favourite treatment performed by the skincare guru is a unique facial he devised to boost the oxygenation and blood flow to the skin cells.

The facial uses molecular oxygen and vitamins to detoxify tissues, unblock pores and tighten the skin. 

When asked by the ELLE US website about her skincare regime, Victoria said: 'I swear by Dr Lancer products. He's a dermatologist that I met in Los Angeles. I started going to him for oxygen facials, and I haven't looked back.

'I don't really use products other than his. I keep it quite simple with a really good polish, then an exfoliating cleanse, then I use a nourish cream, which is a really beautiful moisturiser.' 

Dr Lancer shared the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his A-list clients, such as Kim and Victoria, with FEMAIL.

'I prescribe the Lancer Three-Step Method - step one, polish; step two, cleanse; step three, nourish - to all of my patients, regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics,' he said.

Busy bee: Victoria, who recently won Brand of the Year, explained that she tries to drink lots of water each day and get as much rest as possible, but admits that's hard because she's shares her house with her husband David Beckham and their four children - Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, three

Dr Lancer says his method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) to the epidermis (the outermost layer).  

The Lancer Method reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing, or exfoliation, followed by cleansing, and then nourishing. He believes that by polishing first, the result is a deeper cleanse, a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal.

'Say, for example, you wanted to replace a tile floor. If your epidermis is the floor, then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old, worn out tiles. Next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris, e.g. cleansing, and finally fresh tiles have to be laid, which represent the nourish step,' he said.

'Exfoliation creates a "controlled injury",' he explains. 'Gentle exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed, expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis.

'The controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process, giving skin a younger, fresher look.'

The next step is cleansing, which, as most people know, helps to get rid of everything that has been loosened up by exfoliating.

This is followed by nourish, which delivers anti-oxidants, vitamins and other anti-ageing ingredients to the skin.

Kim is an everyday user of Dr Lancer’s three-step Method, as is Victoria Beckham, who also loves his SPF and the Lift Serum Intense.

Victoria, 
40, uses the serum, which is described as 
'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up 
cellular regeneration'.

The
 luxury serum claims to boost the creation of collagen and new skin 
cells, as well as protect new cells from environmental aggravators. And it's not just Victoria that loves the products; husband David shares all of them, she revealed.

However, 
Victoria and David's favourite serum doesn't come cheap. The 25ml bottle will set 
you back £230 - only the best for the Beckhams, right?

The businesswoman may splurge on expensive creams but she also swears by cheap and easy methods for keeping her health in check.

Victoria explained that she tries to drink lots of water each day and get as much rest as possible, but admits that's hard because she's shares her house with her husband David Beckham and their four children - Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, three.

She added: 'I think it's very important to drink lots of water and get as much sleep as you can. But when you have four children, that's easier said than done.'

The 40-year-old  - who has just teamed up with Nails Inc. to create a debut range of limited edition polishes - also insists having a good diet is just as important for the health of your skin as it is to stay in shape.

The star - who has her own fashion label Victoria Beckham - added: 'You know, I eat very healthily. I eat lots of fish, lots of vegetables, and a lot of fruit. I work out every day, six or seven days.'
