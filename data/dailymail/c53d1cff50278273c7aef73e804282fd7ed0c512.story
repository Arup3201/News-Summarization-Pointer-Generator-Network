Last year's winner Simone Charles wants to be a role model for girls - the kind she never had

Last year's winner was Simone Charles, who wants to be a role model for young girls - the kind she never had.

The size 18 student from London beat thousands of entrants to win the modelling competition.

Simone,
 21, was signed to Models 1, graced the cover of plus-size fashion magazine, SLiNK, and was named the face and body of 
luxury denim line Beauty in Curves.

At 5ft 10inches tall Simone 
she has a gorgeous hourglass figure (bust 44 waist 36 hips 43) and her 
bikini-clad selfie grabbed the judges' attention immediately.

At the time, Models 1 said: 'There has never been a better time to be a curvy model. Demand for our curvy girls just keeps growing and it is not just the size 12, 14 and 16s that in are in demand, brands are looking for size 18 and 20 curves.

'We were so impressed by the calibre of girls that made it through to the final and we really look forward to developing Simone's modelling career'.

An ASOS spokesperson says: 'This is a great opportunity to work with top model agency Models 1, whom we have a great relationship with across our main and plus-size modelling board.

'In line with ASOS, Models 1 know the importance of a healthy body image in all shapes and sizes.  We're looking for a real girl with no previous modelling experience, who we feel reflects the ASOS brand.

'We are extremely conscious of presenting models of an appropriate size and shape to our customers, and welcome all feedback. We have a Petite range and the newly launched ASOS Tall, as well as our ASOS Curve collection, and cast models in a range of sizes to represent these categories.'
