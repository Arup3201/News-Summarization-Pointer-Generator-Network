Holidaymakers were caught up in an international drugs smuggling ring when £3m of heroin was found on board their coach.

Retired Frank Cooper, who organised the trip to Belgium, had no idea the owners of the coach firm, Glen and Gary Wheatley, were using the business to import the Class A drug.

When the bus was stopped and searched at Dover, the haul of 12kg high-purity heroin was found hidden in a compartment above the wheel arch.

Jailed: Glen (left) and Gary Wheatley used their coach business as cover for an international drug smuggling operation. They were arrested and jailed after attempting to transport £3million worth of heroin

Around £3million worth of the drug was found when the vehicle was searched by the UK Border Agency on its way back into Britain

Mr Cooper came under suspicion himself as the organiser of the trip and was arrested on the way back from the holiday, Newcastle Crown Court heard.

Gary Wheatley, 51, who had been persuaded to drive the bus for his brother, was arrested at the scene, but Glen went on the run in Holland.

He was caught after robbing a parking attendant then starting a police chase when he drove down the wrong way on a motorway in Amsterdam.

The court heard he was jailed in Holland for dangerous driving and extradited back to the UK last year to face the drugs charges.

Now Glen, 45, has been jailed for 12-and-a-half years after admitting conspiracy to import drugs, while Gary was given six years.

Recorder William Lowe told the pair: 'You both played for high stakes. This was a sophisticated operation as it involved adapting the coach which was sent on this trip that Mr Cooper, a wholly innocent man, was seeking to organise to Ostend.

'He ended up in custody and arrested as a suspect.'

Border guards found the drugs concealed in the wheel arch of the coach. Retired Frank Cooper, who organised the trip, had no idea the company was hiding drugs on board

The Class A drug was hidden in a specially-designed compartment in the vehicle

The Wheatley brothers had been running G and G Travel, in Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, near Sunderland.

Mr Cooper, a retired coach driver, was unable to use his usual coach company for a short trip to Ostend, Belgium, and so asked the Wheatleys if they could assist.

Gary picked the party up in December 2011, driving from the North East to the continent and was followed by his brother Glen who drove via Manchester.

While the coach was parked up in Belgium, the heroin was loaded into a specially adapted concealed compartment near the wheel arch.

The haul of heroin was packed into cardboard boxes

On the way back the coach was stopped and searched by the UK Border Agency and a total of 11.90kg of high purity heroin was found in 12 parcels, with a street value of between £2m and £3m.

Glen, due to travel back a couple of days later, then went on the run in Holland for eight months.

In July 2012, he was trying to escape from a robbery when he drove the wrong way up a motorway in Amsterdam. He was caught and convicted of dangerous driving and got 15 months in prison.

The court heard their coach business had money problems at the time but that they were unaware of the amount or types of drugs involved.
