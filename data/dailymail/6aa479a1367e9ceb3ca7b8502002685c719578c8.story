Real Betis midfielder Alfred N'Diaye was quick to act and cradle a young fan to safety from the wreckage after the collapse of a fence in the stands of Osasuna's El Sadar Stadium.

The on-loan Sunderland star was on hand immediately after the incident caused during celebrations for the home side's opening goal after 12 minutes through Oriol Riera.

Elated fans for the relegation-threatened host went into raptures after the strike before spilling onto the pitch when the fence gave way.

Despite eventually winning 2-1, Osasuna couldn't escape the drop due to result elsewhere and will join Betis, who were already relegated before this week's fixtures, and Real Valladolid in the Spanish second division next season.

Relegation battle: Officials at the Pamplona ground ensured all was safe before restarting play

The collapse at Pamplona added drama to an already nail-biting final day of La Liga action.

Play was halted for more than 30 minutes when the barrier tumbled to the ground following 
Osasuna's early breakthrough before fans spilled on to 
the pitch.

Around 40 were treated on site for minor complaints and 10
 were taken to hospital but none suffered serious injury, according to 
the local Red Cross.

When play restarted the hosts doubled their lead almost immediately through Javier Acuna but their winning was only one part of their bid to add another year to their 14 spent in the top-flight.

Their delay forced the Spanish professional league (LFP) to extend the halftime breaks in the other three games 
involving relegation-threatened sides until the second-half restart in the Osasuna-Betis match.

Valladolid,
 who were promoted in 2011-12, went down following a 1-0 home defeat by 
Granada, who along with Almeria and Getafe avoided the drop.

Almeria 
drew 0-0 at home to fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao and Getafe beat Rayo 
Vallecano 2-1 in a bad-tempered clash between the two Madrid clubs which
 ended in a mass brawl.

Betis finished in 20th and last place with 25
 points from 38 matches, Valladolid were 19th on 36 and Osasuna 18th on 
39, a point behind Almeria and Elche. Getafe finished in 13th with 42 
points and Granada in 15th on 41.

Atletico Madrid won their first La 
Liga title in 18 years on Saturday thanks to a 1-1 draw at second-placed
 Barcelona in a thrilling climax to the campaign.
