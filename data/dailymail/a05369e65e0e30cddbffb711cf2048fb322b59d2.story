The fan who allegedly made a monkey gesture at Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck has claimed he wasn't being racist - just 'one of the boys'.

Gavin Kirkham, 28, sparked national outrage after he was pictured apparently making a monkey gesture at Welbeck 
from the Matthew Harding Stand during Chelsea’s 5-4 win in the Capital One Cup clash at Stamford Bridge.

Last night he told friends he was 'totally ashamed' of his actions during the match against Manchester United, before adding: 'I'm not racist. I'm just one of the boys.'

'Just one of the boys': Gavin Kirkham, posing here in a 'Borat mankini' on his MySpace page, last night claimed he is not racist

The Daily Mirror today reported that Kirkham, from Letchworth Garden City in
Hertfordshire,  made the admission to his landlord and close friend Kevin Cleverly, 43.

He said: 'I'm totally ashamed of myself and I wish it hadn't happened.

'I'm not a racist. I'm just one of the boys.

'I had a couple of pints and got a bit leary but I'm not a bad lad. I just got wrapped up in the match.' 

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is reported to have said he does not want Kirkham back in the stadium if the allegations prove to be true.

An aide to the Russian told the 
Mirror: 'Roman is not happy. He has spoken to officials and told them 
the man should never be allowed inside the ground again.'

His comments come after Kirkham's actions triggered yet another police 
investigation at the club yesterday.

Kirkham was identified through a Twitter campaign after outraged fans attempted to hunt down the Chelsea supporter accused of racism

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said:
'Police have received a complaint regarding alleged racist behaviour at
Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

'An investigation has been launched. There have been no arrests and enquiries continue.'

Football fans have branded Kirkham 
'an idiot' and called for him to be banned for life after the made the 
alleged monkey gesture while sitting in the front row during Sunday’s league 
game with Manchester United.

Kirkham could not be reached for 
comment but told The Sun he had not been contacted by police and had 
nothing to say because he is 'busy trying to earn a living'.

He lists his pastimes on Facebook as Chelsea, playing football and drinking, the paper reported.

Earlier this year, Chelsea imposed a lifetime ban on a supporter who admitted racially abusing former striker Didier Drogba.

Football fans clamoured to say that the alleged gesture was disgusting and yobbish behaviour

Police said they are investigating the allegations that Gavin Kirkham, pictured above making a variety of facial gestures on a social networking sit, made a racist taunt at a football player 

Kirkham said he did not want to comment, as Chelsea FC said they would ban the individual for life if evidence proved his behaviour was racist

Chelsea Football Club said that they would 'take the strongest possible action, 
including supporting criminal prosecution' against the culprit following this latest incident while supporting police in their investigation.

The club was already embroiled in another racism incident, after 
alleging that referee Mark Clattenburg called John Mikel Obi a ‘monkey’ 
in the league match with United.

A Manchester United spokesman said they will 
'monitor the situation closely', adding: 'It is a matter for Chelsea and the police.'

The incident came just days after 
Chelsea accused referee Mark Clattenburg of using 'inappropriate 
language' towards midfielder John Mikel Obi in Sunday's Premier League 
match against United.

They have made a formal complaint to the FA against Clattenburg.

Longsight-raised Welbeck, the son of Ghanian parents, has risen through the ranks at Old Trafford.

He played for England at the European Championships this summer and scored in the victory over Sweden.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger criticised them 
for publicising their complaint against Clattenburg.

Wenger, however, believes any dispute should have been settled immediately after the match or behind closed doors.

The Frenchman repeatedly hit out at 
Chelsea’s decision to ‘go public’ with their allegations and insisted 
such matters should remain private.

Chelsea dropped their second 
allegation against Clattenburg after an external legal team warned them 
that their claim he called Juan Mata ‘a Spanish t***’ would not stand up
before an FA commission.

The club was apparently persisting with their claim that Clattenburg called 
Mikel a ‘monkey’.

Mikel only discovered the allegation 
when he entered the dressing room last Sunday in a conversation with 
Ramires. Mikel then allegedly attempted to kick down Clattenburg’s door before he 
confronted the official. 

The club's captain, John Terry, is 
currently serving a four-match ban after being found guilty by the FA of
racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand, brother of United star 
Rio.
