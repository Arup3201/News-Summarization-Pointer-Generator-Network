Dita Von Teese brandishing a set of knives, nudity at every turn and lashings of latex can only mean one thing: the work of late photographer, Bob Carlos Clarke.

Now a selection of the photographer's most iconic images will make a return to London next month as part of a new exhibition.

Living Dolls will mark the tenth anniversary since the photographer's legendary final exhibition in 2004, Love-Dolls-Never-Die, before his suicide in 2006.

The new exhibition - Living Dolls - will mark the tenth anniversary since the photographer's final exhibition

The new collection includes several one-off works by the photographer plus 18 of his classic black and white images.

Clarke is most famous for creating provocative images of women in compromising positions that are intended to jar the viewer.

Nevertheless, Clarke also photographed A-lister Rachel Weisz, whom he shot in an oil-slick rubber cat suit, a pregnant Yasmin Le Bon, celebrity chef Marco Pierre White and the burlesque star, Dita Von Teese who was pictured in her trademark corset and heels, while wielding a set of sharp knives.

Clarke was born Ireland in 1950, and came to England in
 1964 to study art and design at the West Sussex College of Art where he
 developed an interest in photography.

GHD, and various exhibitions, Clarke produced six books: The 
Illustrated Delta of Venus (1979), Obsession (1981), The Dark Summer 
(1985), White Heat (1990), Shooting Sex (2002), and Love-Dolls Never Die
 (2004).

His images are now highly collectable
 and have been acquired by national art galleries including the National
 Portrait Gallery, National Media Museum, and the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame Museum.

Describing the late, great photographer, Terence Pepper, Curator of Photographs at the National Portrait Gallery said he was 'one of the great photographic image-makers of the last few decades.'

go on show at The Little Black Gallery, London from 10 May- 21 June 
2014. Visit thelittleblackgallery.com for more information.
