Many little girls grow up dreaming of marrying a prince but few stake their claim to a royal husband quite as early as little Sienna Hughes.

The nine-week-old girl was photographed wearing a babygro that read 'One Day I’m Going to Marry Prince George' by her mother who posted the photograph on Facebook for friends and family to see.

But nearly 200,000 likes later, the picture has become an online sensation after being reposted on a hugely popular fan page for Prince Harry.

Internet sensation: Nine-week-old Sienna Hughes in her royal babygro with her mother Amy Brady, 28

Adorable: This photo of baby Sienna has had more than 200,000 'likes' on Facebook

Many devotees of all things royal even thought the photograph of Sienna was the heir to the throne himself.

Her shocked mother Amy Brady, 28, from Firbanks in Jarrow, said: 'Sienna was starting to outgrow her baby clothes, so my mum, Lesley Brady, who works at George in Asda, bought her a babygro.

'They have lots of different versions. I took a picture of her on Sunday and then posted it on Facebook and Instagram.

'Then, the next day, someone sent me a message asking if I had seen the Prince Harry fan page on Facebook, and the picture of Sienna was on there.

'There’s been almost 200,000 likes. It’s gone viral. I couldn’t believe it. I think it must’ve been picked up on Instagram and posted on the site.'

The Prince Harry page has more than 1.5 million 'likes', and is visited by royal watchers from all over the globe - giving Sienna’s picture a huge audience.

The endearing picture has already attracted more than 5,000 comments. Many web users took to the keyboard to heap praise on the picture of the 'prince' - failing to realise it was a girl from South Tyneside, not a future king from the Windsor family.

Miss Brady, a full-time mother to Sienna and her three sisters Leila, four, Heidi, three, and Eliza, 19 months, added: 'I did have to laugh at quite a few of the comments. A lot of people thought the picture was of Prince George, not of my daughter.

'There was one saying the baby had his mother’s nose and others were thanking Prince Harry for posting the picture.'

Mistaken identity: Many of those visiting Facebook's Prince Harry fan page mistook Sienna for Prince George

Miss Brady has also been contacted by supermarket Asda who have asked to use the photo.

Sadly for Sienna's excited sisters, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge weren't among those getting in touch and Miss Brady has had to gently explain that the royal couple and Prince George won't be dropping in any time soon. 

One person not getting caught up in the frenzy was Sienna herself, who was more interested in her next feed than becoming an internet sensation.

Miss Brady added: 'I was never expecting anything like this.'
