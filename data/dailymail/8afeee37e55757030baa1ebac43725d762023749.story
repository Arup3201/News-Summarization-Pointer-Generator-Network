Convinced: Detective Hilton Botha believes Oscar Pistorius is guilty of murder

The detective who first led the Oscar Pistorius murder case has said he is convinced the Paralympic gold medalist is guilty. 

Detective Hilton Botha was heavily criticised for his bungling of the investigation into the murder of Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp who was shot dead in the blade runner's house. 

Botha was then forced to step down when it emerged he faced his own charges of attempted murder for a 2011 case in which he and two other officers fired on a vehicle in an attempt to make it stop. 

Speaking to Vanity Fair, Botha, who knew Pistorius from a previous arrest on assault charges, said: 'The only place there could have been entrance was the open bathroom window and we did everything we could to see if anyone went through it, and it was impossible.

'So I thought it was an open-and-closed case. He shot her - that's it.' 

Pistorius, 26, is charged with the murder of his girlfriend Reeva, who was shot after she locked herself in his bathroom in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. He claims he mistook her for an intruder.

The prosecution says it was a premeditated murder, but his defence advocate has argued there is no evidence to suggest the athlete's account of events is untrue.

In a dramatic twist, it then emerged that Detective Botha had been charged with seven counts of attempted murder. 

The case was previously dropped but he was charged again and Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo replaced Botha as lead investigator.

According to Steenkamp's friends, they apparently noticed warning signs leading up to the death.

Pepi Dimevski, who tattooed the word 'lioness' on her ankle, said Pistorius' name was not good on the street.

While Steenkamp's cousin Kim Martin described him as a nice guy, but on one occasion, when Pistorius had left the table, she asked Steenkamp if she was happy to which she gave a hesitant response.

However, close friends of Pistorius are still shocked by the event. 

Mike Azzie, who Pistorius calls Uncle Mike, said every time the athlete mentions Reeva he says he is a broken man.

Earlier this month it was revealed that Pistorius will be allowed to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms to allow him to make money. 

Layers successfully argued that he should be allowed to travel abroad to 'earn income' while awaiting trial. 

The controversial decision clears the way for him to take part in London's showpiece athletics event at the Olympic Stadium.

Although charged with murder, Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter Britain by the Home Office. 

It is now likely that he will compete at the London Anniversary Games, which takes place from July 26 to 28 at the Olympic Stadium in East London - one year on from London 2012.

Since his arrest the athlete has sold assets including a share in a racehorse and property.
