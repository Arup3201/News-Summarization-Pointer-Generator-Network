A deadly new virus that has emerged in the Middle East is thought to be more dangerous than SARS after it killed 38 people in a year.

More than 60 cases of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) have been reported in the last year by the World Health Organisation.

Many of those who have the disease, which can spread easily between people, were in Saudi Arabia, reported Fox News.

Doctors are worried after the new MERS disease showed the potential to become as deadly as SARS

There was a global outbreak of SARS in 2003, killing 800 people, and some experts note the resemblances between the two as both spread easily between hospitals.

Symptoms are also similar with a fever and cough that develops into pneumonia.

But, doctors note that the fatality rate is higher. Eight per cent of SARS patients died, while 65 per cent of MERS cases are believed to have been fatal.

However, the illness so far has not spread as quickly as SARS did.

Dr. Trish Perl a senior hospital epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine said that she thought it was a lot like SARS.

Most cases of the disease have been recorded in Saudi Arabia, which expects millions of Muslin pilgrims to visit next month during Ramadan

She added: ‘In the right circumstances, the spread could be explosive.’

Doctors have not been able to pinpoint exactly how the illness is spread in every case, as some appeared to catch it when they had not been in contact with an infected person.

MERS cases have also been reported in Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Tunisia.

But, most cases have been in Saudi Arabia, which is set to receive millions of Muslim pilgrims during Ramadan next month.

Dr. Clemens Wendtner, who treated a 
MERS patient who later died in Munich, said: ‘We need more information 
from other countries to find out what the best treatment is.

‘Our patient got everything possible and it still didn't help him.’

Previous outbreaks of SARS around the world have caused deaths, spreading panic and alarm

Experts say that despite the small number of cases, MERS must be watched as it has the potential to cause an outbreak.

WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan  said: ‘We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat.’

WHO is set to meet in Cairo next month to discuss MERS and its potential threat.
