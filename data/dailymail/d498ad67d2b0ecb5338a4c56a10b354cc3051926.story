A 44-year-old man has appeared in court charged with the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock who died during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985.

Nicholas Jacobs is accused of hacking to death the 40-year-old officer, who was stabbed as he tried to protect firefighters as they tackled a blaze at a supermarket during the height of the unrest in Tottenham, north London.

Wearing a grey tracksuit, bearded Jacobs, who was just 16 at the time of the killing, spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth during a short hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

He was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Friday.

Pc Blakelock, 40, was set upon by a mob armed with machetes and stabbed dozens of times in Tottenham, north London as he tried to protect firefighters tackling a blaze at a supermarket.

It is claimed the policeman stumbled and was surrounded by a mob screaming, 'kill the pig'.

He was knifed 42 times and it is believed his attackers tried to decapitate him in order to display his head on a pole in a gruesome taunt to other officers.

Aftermath: The Broadwater Farm riot occurred in Tottenham, North, causing substantial damage to the residential area

Pc Blakelock had been sent down to the Broadwater Farm Estate with fellow officer PC Richard Coombes, and were trying to help firefighters who were tackling a blaze

The father-of-three was eventually dragged away by colleagues, but he died later that evening in North Middlesex Hospital on October 6 1985.

Pc Blakelock, from Sunderland, had been sent down to the Broadwater Farm Estate with fellow officer PC Richard Coombes, when the pair were set upon by a gang armed with knives.

Pc Coombes also suffered serious injuries and never returned to duty.

Race riots had erupted in north London after a West Indian woman, Cynthia Jarrett, 49, died from massive heart failure after police raided her home.

Officers had stopped her son, Floyd Jarrett, 24, to inspect his car’s tax disc. He was charged with theft and assault at a Tottenham police station, but later cleared of both counts.

Cynthia Jarrett’s death sparked violent unrest and accusations that parts of the Met were 'institutionally racist', plunging the country's race relations into crisis.

Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle adjourned the case and Jacobs was remanded in custody.

Jacobs will appear at the Old Bailey on July 26 for a first hearing and a preliminary hearing will be held on August 1 also at the Old Bailey.
