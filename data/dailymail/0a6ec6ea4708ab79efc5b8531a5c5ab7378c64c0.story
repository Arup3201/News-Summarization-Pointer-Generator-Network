Arsenal swept aside Barclays Premier League holders Manchester City in the Community Shield to send a warning to their title rivals that they mean business this season.

The Gunners were top for almost the entire first half of the last campaign but eventually finished well off the pace. Here,Sportsmail brings you five reason why they can go all the way this year.

SUPER SANCHEZ

Arsenal's new £30million man Alexis Sanchez is the latest gem, full of class and elegance and technique to match, at Arsene Wenger's disposal.

He may have played only 45 minutes against City, but the plucky Chilean showed glimpses of what Arsenal fans can expect from him this season.

Sanchez can play anywhere across the front line and will cause havoc for defences across the country with his adeptness at switching flanks or playing through the middle.

OZIL RETURNS

Mesut Ozil had an indifferent debut season at Arsenal following his £42.5million move from Real Madrid last summer. Like the club, he started the campaign strongly but faded towards the end.

Fresh from winning the World Cup with Germany, if Ozil can carry that confidence into his second season in north London then he could well become one of the stars of the league.

No-one doubts that the forward has the ability to become Arsenal's attacking fulcrum and it will make them one of the most dangerous teams in the league if he fulfils that potential.

ATTACKING OPTIONS

Wenger was going weak at the knees about his attacking options after they hit three past City on Sunday. Not only have they spent more than £70m on Sanchez and Ozil in the past year, they have welcomed back Joel Campbell from his loan spells and after his displays at the World Cup for Costa Rica and at Olympiacos last season he is like another signing.

They've added to Olivier Giroud, Lukas Podolski, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere and Tomas Rosicky to create a frightening choice of attacking options.

After the Community Shield victory Wenger said: 'Three, four, five years ago we lost a big player every year. In the last two years we’ve added players, like Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. I have more attacking options than I’ve had for a long time.'

BIG GAME MENTALITY

Arsenal ultimately came undone by their inability to perform well against the top sides last season. They were on the receiving end of some humiliating defeats – a 6-3 loss to City, a 6-0 hammering by Chelsea and a 5-1 demolition by Liverpool.

Ramsey admitted after the Community Shield: 'In these games last season we have been guilty of conceding early on. It's difficult enough so it was important today for us to stay in the game, wait for them to open up, and we capitalised on that.

'We’re more than capable - the team has a good team spirit. We need to improve on the big games so hopefully now we’ve learnt our lesson, we can go into this season and have a good go.'

His manager agreed with him. 'Last year we were very consistent against teams outside the top six and not consistent against top-six teams,' Wenger said. 'The year before it was the reverse. It’s hoped that this year it will be right on both sides.'

Get that right and they will be one of the favourites to lift the title.

DEFENSIVE CHAMBERS

Wenger threw young defender Calum Chambers in at the deep end playing in the centre of defence – having played last season as right back for Southampton – against one of the best attacks in the country. He was one of best players on the pitch.

Chambers' reading of the game makes him a ideal at the heart of the defence and Wenger has already told the player he will trial him at centre back or possibly as a defensive midfielder.

He is still only 19 but, following his £12m move, has already been talked about as having the potential to emulate Tony Adams at the north London club.

Bright future: Summer signing Calum Chambers can play at both right-back and centre-back

Wenger described his display against City as 'outstanding' and hinted that Chambers could be first-choice centre back this season.

If the Frenchman has unearthed another Adams, they will have one of the most formidable defences in the league to match their attack.
