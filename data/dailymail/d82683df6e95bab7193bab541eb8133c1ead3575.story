Once upon a time, wearing a barely-there dress required the careful application of sticky tape – and about as much confidence as a  Hollywood actress.

But the secret behind celebrities’ barely-there frocks has been revealed.

And it is the ‘InvisiBra’ keeping the stars’ dignity intact, with silicone cups that stick to the skin.

Yesterday it emerged that the strapless self-adhesive bra is rapidly becoming the must-have item in celebrity wardrobes, while high-street alternatives have also begun to emerge as the trend for back-less and side-less has filtered down from the catwalk. .

Miss Paltrow, who attended a premiere last year wearing a frock with full-length sheer panels on either side, is thought to have worn an InvisiBra or similar.

So too has Harry Potter actress Miss Watson, who wore an entirely backless dress to the Golden Globes – adding a pair of leggings so as to retain some degree of dignity.

Black Swan actress Natalie Portman and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell are also believed to have invested in such bras.

The InvisiBra will no doubt come as a welcome development in underwear technology to anyone who has battled with self-adhesive tape in the past. So-called ‘tit-tape’ was at one time the only option to avoid unsightly straps being seen when wearing a delicate dress, while others may have braved going braless altogether, risking embarrassment should fabric shift out of place.

The InvisiBra, which was created by a lingerie company called Lavalia, is the first to do away with straps and backs altogether.

Made from either silicone - £48 – or fabric - £38 – the bras, look like two cups joined together with a tiny clasp.

They were designed in response to demand from brides-to-be wanting to wear strap or back-less dresses on their wedding days.

And according to a Lavalia spokesperson demand has soared since they were first launched in London last summer and there has been a 30 per cent rise month-on-month from December to January with 70 now sold a day.

‘January has been a fantastic month for InvisiBra, we’ve been selling around 70 bras a day. This could be as it is award season and women, who regularly see gowns in the media that are perfect for wearing an InvisiBra with, have been looking for ways to wear similar dresses without risking their dignity.

‘Celebrities love the InvisiBra because it’s so versatile and it enables them to wear any style of top or dress without fear of it slipping off and exposing too much. Many of the celebrities who have suffered embarrassing nip-slips recently could have saved their blushes by investing in an InvisiBra.’

Although the InvisBra is only sold online, similar bras have found their way on to the high street with Debenhams and Marks and Spencer stocking similar self-adhesive items.

Last night Marks and Spencer reported a rise in sales of its Strapless Stick On Adhesive Bra, which is almost identical to the InvisiBra but has a sheer silicone band that wraps around the torso to help support the cups.

While in Debenhams, the brand’s Natural Stick On Bra is attached to the skin with sticky taps on either side of the cups.
