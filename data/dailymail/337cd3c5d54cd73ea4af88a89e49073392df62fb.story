A potent painkiller made from the poison of jungle frogs is believed to have entered the food chain in contaminated horse meat, it has today been revealed.

The drug - dermorphin - is used to drug racehorses, enabling them to run while they are badly injured.

It is believed that the 'tree frog juice' has found its way on to the market via American horse meat, the Humane Society International has warned, despite a ban on the use of medicines in animals which will be sold for meat.

The animal 
welfare organisation has linked with its American partners and called for a ban on the sale of horse meat from across the North Atlantic, the Sunday Express reports.

It
said there was 'no doubt that substantial numbers' of American 
horses sold to Europe had been given veterinary drugs, despite the fact there is a lifetime ban on substances for food 
animals under EU rules.

Holly
 Hazard, of The Humane Society Of The United States, told the paper there was 'virtually no horse' racing in America which had escaped a prescription for pain-masking drugs.

She said: 'In
 addition, there is no way to track illegal substances such as 
dermorphin, routinely used by unscrupulous horse trainers to enhance 
performance, because laboratories wouldnâ€™t even know to test for these 
drugs.

'Sport, working, companion and performance horses do not 
belong in the food supply as the meat simply cannot be guaranteed safe.'

More than 100,000 horses are slaughtered in America each year and sold to 
Europe.

It comes as Everton FC catering suppliers have withdrawn beef from its UK sites - after a frozen product was found to contain horse DNA.

Sodexo said products were being recalled with 'immediate effect' but would not confirm which of its sites had been supplied with the frozen products.

An Everton spokesman said Sodexo was keeping the club informed, but there was no evidence any food sold at Goodison was contaminated with horse meat.

They added the firm do supply the club with frozen products but they hold 'Red Tractor' assurance.Sodexo Prestige runs catering for the Blues including all the hospitality for match days but do not supply the training ground.

The company said: 'Sodexo has had a pro-active programme in place to ensure that there is no horse meat in its supply chain.

'We demanded written assurances from across our supply chain that the products we purchase did not contain horse meat, and additionally implemented an internal sampling programme.

'Despite repeated guarantees from our suppliers, our sampling has identified frozen beef products which tested positive for equine DNA. This situation is totally unacceptable.

Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh said 'thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people' have eaten horse meat over at least several months

Food manufacturer Findus confirmed on February 7 results of tests carried out by Britain's Food Standards Agency that showed that the company's beef lasagne contained horse meat

Tesco has previously revealed its Everyday value spaghetti bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horse meat

'We felt the only appropriate response was to withdraw not only this product but all frozen beef products.

'We will only re-admit into our catering operations products that have affirmatively passed DNA testing, pursuant to laboratory test criteria.'

The
 Food Standards Agency said it was assessing the need for any further 
veterinary medicine testing of both horses slaughtered in the UK and of 
horse meat found in food.

Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh said that it was now known that criminals had been passing off untraceable horse meat into products that 'thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people have eaten over at least several months.'

She added: 'The Government should order companies to test all products adulterated with horse meat to check that there is no risk to human health from any horse medication.'
