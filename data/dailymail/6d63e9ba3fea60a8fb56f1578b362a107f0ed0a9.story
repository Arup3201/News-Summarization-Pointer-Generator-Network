Sickening: Corporal Stephen Curley was killed by a bomb detonated by a 14-year-old Afghani boy

A Royal Marine was blown up in Afghanistan by a 14-year-old boy who was promised just $80 to set off a roadside bomb.

Father-of-one Stephen Curley, 26, was killed instantly when the bomb was detonated in the town Sangin in Helmand province in May last year.

Just days after his death the boy's father handed him in to the local police and he confessed to setting off the device.

The boy named Aga Wali confessed to the killing after the Taliban reneged on their promise to pay him, saying he should be acting out of insurgent zeal.

An inquest at Exeter heard today how the boy had been sentenced to imprisonment by Afghan authorities but that it is not known how long he will serve or if he is still in custody.

The boy was handed into the Afghan police at the same base in Sangin where Corporal Curley had been stationed until his death.

However, he was never handed over to British security or intelligence officers but was instead questioned by the local Afghan chief of police.

Stephen's widow Kirianne, aged 28, who is caring for their 17-month-old son William on her own, only learned of the hired killer hours before the start of the inquest when she was shown statements from two Royal Marines officers.

Lieutenant Colonel Paul James, who was in charge of operations with 40 Commando at the time said he had been informed of the boy's confession.

He said: 'I received a report from the Afghan national police that a 14-year-old boy had been handed in by his father for being the trigger man in an IED attack.

'The boy was named as Aga Wali and he admitted firing the device which killed a Royal Marine in Southern Sangin on a date which corresponded to the explosion which fatally wounded Corporal Curley.

'The father was concerned that his son was embarking upon a life as a fighter with the Taliban and feared for his life.

'He said Aga Wali had been told he would be paid $80 by the Taliban but when he went for payment they said aggressively he should be fighting for ideological reasons and not financial gain.

'Aga Wadi left angrily and felt betrayed. The boy was detained briefly within the national directorate of security before being processed through the courts and a sentence of imprisonment was imposed of an uncertain period of time.'

Captain Dom Rogers said: 'It was brought to my attention the Afghan national police had detained an adolescent named Aga Wali and there was speculation he had been handed in by his father.

'He was questioned by the local chief of police and I was present during the latter stages with an interpreter to ensure it was conducted in the correct manner.

'In my presence he admitted activating an IED and acting as the trigger man.

'He was unable to read a map but was able to describe the ground and it fitted with that where Corporal Curley was wounded fatally.

'From this information and the time and date when he said the event took place it was reasonable to assume he was responsible for initiating the IED that killed Corporal Curley.

'I was told the chief of police had taken the initial confession and there had been a written statement which he had signed,

'He was flown to Lashkar Gar by an US military helicopter and tried through the Afghan justice system.

'He was arrested and detained by the Afghan police and remained in their custody throughout under Afghan law.

'I was later told by the chief of police he was given a prison sentence but we have no further details about the sentence.'

Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said: 'All I will say is that any report to this court from the Afghan National police has yet to be received and I am told the matter is being pursued by agencies in theatre.'
