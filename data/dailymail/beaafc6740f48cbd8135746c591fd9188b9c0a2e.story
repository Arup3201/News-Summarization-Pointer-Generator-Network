It may be the last day of summer but forecasters are predicting that the first week of autumn is to be warmer than average.

As many children head back to school this week, temperatures are set to rise from Tuesday onwards, according to the Met Office.

And by Friday it could be as warm as 24 or 25C during sunny spells in the south - with the overall average temperature for September being a significantly lower 16C or 17C.

Today, people were making the most of the sunny, warm weather with one sunbather pictured on the deck of Illustrious in Portsmouth harbour soaking up the rays, with temperatures said to be as high as 22C in the south.

Meanwhile wake boarders, sailors and water skiers were seen taking to the water of Windermere in the Lake District while a farmer pictured harvesting lavender at a farm in Hertfordshire.

People also flocked to Folkestone beach in Kent again today digging for buried treasure at Outer Harbour beach near Sunny Sands as part of the Triennial arts festival.

The art project called Folkestone Digs is funded by Bristol-based designers Situations and the idea for the project came from Berlin-based artist Michael Sailstorfer.

Small ingots of gold worth a total of £10,000 have been buried on the beach with 10 gram bars worth £250 and 20 gram bars worth £500.

However, forecasters say that as the new season gets under way tomorrow, cloud and rain will push in from the north tonight, heading southwards, making the first morning of autumn cloudy and dull with outbreaks of rain.

But drier and brighter conditions will push in from the north west and while south-eastern parts will stay cloudy for much of the day with outbreaks of rain, those conditions are expected to clear - and then temperatures are set to increase.

Farmers made the most of the warm and sunny weather to harvest their bumper lavender crop today, where temperatures reached up to 22C in the south 

The farmers use a special harvester which mimics the way lavender would have been picked 100 years ago by just cutting off the flower heads

Farmers were hoping to extract 30 per cent more oil this year due to the long dry spell earlier in the summer which helped to produce magnificent fields of deep purple plant

Scotland and the north of England could see temperatures of 20C or 21C.

Krista Mitchell, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: 'What we've got is high pressure building which is bringing more settled conditions, and also slightly warmer conditions as well.

'We had a pretty cool August, temperatures in places below average for the last couple of weeks, so it looks like it's warming up as we go into the middle of the week.

'It's not going to be wall-to-wall sunshine but where there are sunny spells it's going to feel pretty warm.

'Generally temperatures are rising day on day from Tuesday, basically. By Thursday or Friday, we could see 24C or 25C in the sunny spells in the south."

'It's not a negative picture for the north by any stretch.'
