BBC Radio 4's flagship Today programme was a victim of strike action this morning, as thousands of journalists walked out to show their fury at the broadcaster's redundancy plans.

The programme was forced to air at 7am, an hour later than usual, as members 
of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) took industrial action across
the UK.

Further casualties of the job cuts row is BBC2's Newsnight, which will not be aired and a repeat of Have I got News For You broadcast in its place.

A swathe of Radio 4 programmes such 
as The World At One and PM have born the brunt of the journalists' fury at the corporation.

No Newsnight tonight: Jeremy Paxman's show has been shelved because of the strike

But despite the strike action, listeners who
tuned in to Radio 4 this morning were greeted by the familiar tones of regular Today 
presenters John Humphrys and Sarah Montague.

The
broadcaster is battling to maintain its usual service, but the huge 
numbers of employees joining the strike means shows will inevitably be 
affected.

BBC Radio 5 Live was also hit this morning, playing pre-recorded programmes to replace its regular Up All Night show.

Picket lines were mounted outside studios and offices, including the BBC
TV Centre in west London, Bush House in central London and cities 
including Belfast, Glasgow and Manchester.

The 24-hour strike by the National Union of Journalists is the second
in a matter of weeks in protest at compulsory redundancies at the BBC 
World Service and BBC Monitoring following cuts in government funding.

The union said early reports were that the strike was being 'solidly supported' by the 3,000 NUJ members at the corporation.

But an email from the BBC's business operations director, Lucy Adams, said six out of seven staff turned up to work.

But the corporation insists that carving off a large chunk of staff is essential because of steep cuts in government funding.

NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet joined a picket line at TV 
Centre shortly after midnight and will address strikers outside Bush 
House later today.

She said journalists were angered at a 'change in approach' by the BBC 
to slash roles, with a number of compulsory redundancies already made and 
more expected in the coming weeks.

The two sides will meet for talks on August 11, but the NUJ leader said:
'There has been absolutely no meaningful movement from the BBC to 
address the cases of individual journalists losing their jobs now.'

An NUJ spokesman accused the 
corporation of unnecessarily spending money on redundancies, rather than
moving staff to different roles.

He said: 'All the journalists currently affected are 
willing to accept redeployment and they face an uncertain future through
no fault of their own.

'The BBC is wasting thousands of pounds making skilled and experienced 
people compulsorily redundant instead of redeploying staff.

'This is 
money that should be used to make better programmes and to ensure the 
future of quality journalism at the corporation.'

Picket lines: Journalists have pitched their protests outside BBC offices around the country, including the Bush House centre in London

A BBC spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that the NUJ is intending to 
strike and apologise to our audience for any disruption to services this
may cause.

'Industrial action will not alter the fact that the BBC is faced with a 
number of potential compulsory redundancies, following significant cuts 
to the central government grants that support the World Service and BBC 
Monitoring.

'We will continue with our efforts to reduce the need for compulsory 
redundancies.

'However, the number of posts that we are having to close 
means that, unfortunately, it is likely to be impossible for us to avoid
some compulsory redundancies.'

NUJ members working for the BBC's Arabic service were on the third day of a six-day strike in a separate dispute over rotas. 

Broadcasting bosses are said to be even more worried about the impact of
a work-to-rule action that will follow today's walkout. 

This will stop staff acting up or going beyond their allotted hours - practices upon which the BBC is said to rely.
