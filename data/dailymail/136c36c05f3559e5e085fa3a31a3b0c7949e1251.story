Facebook users have slammed Sportsgirl's new collection, 'Polynesian Girl', labelling their marketing campaign as 'culturally insensitive'.

The Australian women's fashion chain launched their floral spring collection this month and so far it has received negative feedback from consumers online.

The fashion label's use of a skinny blonde, blue-eyed  model in their campaign has been the target of criticism, as social media users insist that their representation of Polynesia is an insult to their culture and style.

The Australian women's fashion chain launched their floral spring collection in October and so far have not received positive feedback from consumers

Floral and leafy patterns of bright yellows, reds, blues, pinks and greens are used to illustrate the fashion labels idea of a 'Polynesian' theme but Facebook comments insist that Sportsgirl design is a poor representation

Floral and leafy patterns of bright yellows, reds, blues, pinks and greens are used to illustrate a 'Polynesian' theme but Facebook comments insist that Sportsgirl's design is a poor representation of the culture.

'Floral patterned material does not make it Polynesian, and your blonde model shows even more lack of thought! tacky tacky tacky!,' Amanda Hoppitt wrote on Sportsgirl's page. 

Although many clothing companies release floral designs, this fashion chain has negatively aroused some Facebook consumers, causing them to post heated comments on their page.

The fashion industry has slowly stopped using cultural appropriation in their marketing technique after Elle magazine was slammed for featuring musician Pharrell Williams in a native American headdress on their front cover in June this year,birdeemag.com reported. 

Another user has attacked their campaign, insisting Sportsgirl is 'taking advantage of another culture' in an 'attempt to make it a fashion statement'

Consumers on Facebook have pointed out that Sportsgirl has ignored this cultural issue and instead demonstrates poor and distasteful marketing in their new collection. 

'Poorest taste in fashion advertising I have ever seen, totally culturally offensive!', Tree Macleod wrote. 

Another user who has attacked their campaign insists Sportsgirl is 'taking advantage of another culture' in an 'attempt to make it a fashion statement'.

'Reducing a whole area of Islands with all its richness and cultural diversity down to a fashion line that is only profitable for your company. AND using a white, blonde model to represent Polynesian WoC is extremely offensive. THIS IS BLATANT CULTURAL APPROPRIATION', Ms Hoppitt wrote. 

Sportsgirl has also been slammed for their sizes, as Maeve Tib claimed majority of Polynesian women would be unable to fit in their clothing.

'A shop that doesn't even produce clothing at sizes a lot of Polynesian women would be able to wear makes some floral clothes, pops them on a white chick then calls it 'Polynesian Girl.' Do you have internet access, Sportsgirl? Did you research this at all? Have you managed to miss ALL the debate about cultural appropriation, racism and diversity? Ridiculous,' Ms Tib.  

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sportsgirl for comment. 

The first Sportsgirl store was opened in 1948 in Melbourne and since then the company has established 114 stores nationally.

'Polynesian girl' has only been launched for a week and has already received dozens of comments on Facebook that scrutinises their new collection
