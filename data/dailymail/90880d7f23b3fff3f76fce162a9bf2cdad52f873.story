A 14-year-old boy who allegedly murdered his great-grandmother has told a court how he and a friend took turns hitting her with a hatchet and a hammer so they could kill her and steal her money.

Antonio Barbeau gave the chilling details as he testified in the trial of his friend Nathan Paape, who has pleaded not guilty to the grisly crime in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in September last year.

Barbeau told the court that the weekend before the murder of 78-year-old Barbara Olson, he and Paape had talked about ways to get money and how they could steal from his great-grandmother.

On the day of the murder, they asked Barbeau's mother for a ride to 'a 
friend's house' and then they walked two miles to the home, where Olson found them in the garage.

Testimony: Antonio Barbeau raises his hand to take the oath before testifying during a trial for his friend Nathan Paape, with whom he allegedly killed his great-grandmother last year

'We were going to try to scare her to 
get money and use force if needed,' said Barbeau, who has already been convicted in the case and is now awaiting his sentencing.

When asked what type 
of force they planned to use, Barbeau said: 'An 
attack, I guess to kill.'

She invited them into her home and as she turned her back to call Barbeau's mother, Barbeau hit her on the head with the hatchet, the Shaboygan Press reported.

He said he then ran to the bathroom as he was feeling sick but that when he emerged, he saw Paape hit the woman with the hammer multiple times.

Weapon: Sheboygan Falls Police officer Nicole Schmelter holds up an axe allegedly from the crime

'She was still yelling when I went to the bathroom, but had stopped when I returned,' he said.

Barbeau then hit Olson with the hatchet again, and said Paape then took the weapon from him and hit her once or twice too.

Victim: Barbara Olson, 78, was found in a pool of blood at her home last September

The account came in stark contrast with Paape's, the Shaboygan Press reported.

Paape claimed the robbery and 
murder were Barbeau's idea and that he only hit Olson twice 
with a hammer because he feared his friend would turn on him.

Paape thought Barbeau was joking about killing Olson, his lawyer said. But Barbeau said his friend never suggested he thought it was a joke.

He has pleaded not guilty but if convicted, he faces life in prison and a minimum 20 years in prison.

Barbara Olsen's body was found in a pool of blood outside her home last September.

Once the teens realized Olsen was 
dead after the horrific attack, they attempted to drag her body to the 
car, leaving a trail on blood through the house, police said last 
September.

After failing to load Olsen into the vehicle, they dumped her in the garage. 

The boys then allegedly stole several items, including a purse, loose change and jewelry.

The
perpetrators then hopped into Olson's car and sped off. They eventually
dumped the vehicle in the parking lot of a local bowling alley and 
walked to a nearby eatery, where they shared a pizza.

Investigation: The teens were arrested just 12 hours after the woman's body was discovered at her home

The
teens later returned to the abandoned car and tried to wipe off their 
fingerprints, the complaint states. They left some of their loot in 
plain sight, along with the car keys, hoping that someone would steal 
the vehicle and get blamed for Olsen's murder.

They locked the weapons in the trunk of the car, along with a bloody piece of cloth.

Olsen’s body was discover in the driveway of her Westridge Drive home and 12 hours later, the boys were arrested.

Differs from Paape's account, who said it was not his idea

Paape faces life in prison if he is found guilty; Barbeau has already been found guilty and is awaiting sentencing
