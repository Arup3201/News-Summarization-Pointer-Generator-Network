Police chased a black bear cub for more than three hours around north-east Albuquerque in New Mexico. 

Footage of the young bear's escapade shows police cars trailing a lolloping bear cub around suburban streets.

Police chased the bear from La Cueva High School, appropriately called 'Home of the Bears' for their mascotthe black bear, to Black Bear Lane, where they lost him.

Bear on the lam: This juvenile bear led police on a three-hour chase through north-east Albuquerque before disappearing somewhere off Black Bear Lane

The little bear eluded police before trotting into the aptly named Black Bear Lane and Black Bear Loop and disappearing into the foothills.

Game and Fish officials suspect the bear was recently let loose by its mother and was looking for a new home.

New Mexico Game and Fish officials said the bear is young, probably 
weighing around 100 to 150 pounds, and that this sighting wasn't 
unique.

'It's sort of happening statewide right now,' Rick 
Winslow, a bear and cougar biologist with Game and Fish, told KRQE News 
13. 

'We're seeing a lot of bear activity.'

Homeless: Experts say the juvenile bear was probably let loose by his mother and is searching for new territory

Winslow said this time of year is when bears are typically on the move searching for a territory and a mate.

'The
younger animals are kicked out because of more dominant animals, and so
they're moving across the landscape trying to find a place to live,' 
Winslow said.

It sounds as though this bear cub was seeking a new territory and strayed into the urban area.

While the cub is cute, its bigger relatives regularly cause trouble around the state.

Winslow said that more animals are coming into populated areas looking 
for food and water, a movement that's exacerbated by the current drought.

'In the southern part of the state, there's been a couple of bears that have actually killed cattle,' Winslow said.

On
Tuesday a bear broke into a home in Cimarron, New Mexico and attacked an elderly woman, who suffered minor injuries.

The 400-pound bear was tracked by dogs and killed by authorities, who took its body to be tested for rabies.

Winslow said sightings like Thursday's of juvenile bears will only increase in coming weeks.

'With the good bear population statewide, we can anticipate seeing more animals moving around and getting into human communities,' Winslow said.

New Mexico Game and Fish officials say residents should be wary of putting out trash before the day of removal, and not to put out birdseed, which will attract hungry bears.
