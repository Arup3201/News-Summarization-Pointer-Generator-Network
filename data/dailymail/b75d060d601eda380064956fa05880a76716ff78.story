New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner raised eyebrows at a political meeting in Brooklyn on Thursday when he suggested that an elderly woman in the audience might be flirting with him.

Weiner was taking questions from attendees at a Friends of the United Block Association of Brooklyn meeting when he noticed a gesture from one woman.

‘Were you raising your hand or flirting with me?’ Weiner asked the woman, who had tentatively raised her hand.

Flirt? Anthony Weiner asked an elderly woman at a meeting on Thursday evening if she was flirting with him when she tried to ask a question

The off-the-cuff comment drew slightly uncomfortable laughter from the crowd, who otherwise were responsive to his message about education and public safety.

After the forum, Weiner told The New York Observer that the comment had been meant as a joke.

In a radio interview on Friday, he downplayed another incident from Wednesday evening when an angry Weiner had shouted down by a voter who
asked him asked about his infamous sexting scandal.

Weiner told WCBS radio host Steve Scott that the incident Democratic district leader Jessie Strauss was little more than a 'New York-style' exchange of opinions.

'I’d say, basically, standing up for want you believe in, speaking clearly to people, and understanding they’re gonna push back pretty hard,' he said.

'I frankly like that tussle of politics and tussle of the way we do things in New York. You know, you can have five New Yorkers standing in a circle, and you can have 12 or 13 different opinions and I like it that way.'

Strauss had told Weiner at a small gathering in Williamsburg, Brooklyn on Wednesday that 'we can't have our politicians going around apologizing all the time,' according  Buzzfeed.

Weiner responded curtly, 'Listen, if you believe that my personal failings disqualify me, don’t vote for me. But, my friend, I’m not sure exactly what it is that you’re asking for.'

Strauss said he would be supporting New York City public advocate Bill de Blasio's campaign. Weiner responded by rolling his eyes. 

'That's a surprise,' he quipped.

After another minute of verbal sparring, Weiner said, 'I’m gonna win this election, OK? And I’m gonna govern this city really well. And I’m gonna do it based on a foundation of Democratic ideals, and I’m gonna do it on a foundation of progressive values, and I’m gonna do it smart.'

He added coyly: 'If you don’t think I should even be standing here today, I certainly would respect that. I mean, you’re supporting another candidate who’s not gonna win.'

By the time of his exchange with Strauss, Weiner had already been confronted about the sexting scandal that forced him to resign from Congress in 2011.

Chris Owens, a Brownstone Brooklyn district leader, told Weiner, 'I have a three word question, "How dare you?"' I’m a parent, I’ve got two sons. I represent the Democratic Party.

'I am outraged and disgusted by you, both by what you did and by the fact that you have the arrogance to run for mayor now. And the only reason why you’re running for mayor is because you have this money that you’re going to lose.'

'Now you come back – not even four, eight years later – you come back after two years and you expect us to embrace you because you have good ideas?'

Weiner said he appreciated the question and realized that many people will feel that way. And then he accused Owens of holding a grudge against him because Weiner supported Owens' rival when he ran for Congress in 2006. 

'All I can say is that I have explained - and I’ll explain it to as many people who want to ask me about those things - that it was a personal mistake that I made,' Weiner added.
