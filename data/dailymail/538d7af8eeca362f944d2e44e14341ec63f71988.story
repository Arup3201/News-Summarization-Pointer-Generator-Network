A Sicilian mafia boss dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge could finally be extradited back to Italy after spending two decades holed up in the leafy London suburb.

Domenico Rancadore, 65, also known as The Professor in mafia circles, fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo.

Eventually he was tracked down but the Italian authorities had their bid to have the don extradited quashed on human rights grounds, with Rancadore's lawyers arguing the country's prisons were not safe.

The ageing mafia 'linchpin' was told in March last year that he would not not be extradited to serve the seven-year jail term because of concerns over the state of Italian jails.

Rancadore's lawyers had argued that his ailing health, including heart problems, would not be catered for in an Italian prison.

But last month the High Court ruled that Italian jail cells were safe and not overcrowded, allowing extradition proceedings to get back underway. 

Hannah Hinton, prosecuting, today told a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'Figures demonstrate the Italian authorities have been committed over time to reducing the number of inmates in prison.'

Rancadore did not appear at today's hearing because he is in hospital, but his lawyer Alun Jones QC said he would be discharged soon.

The mafia boss lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner after arriving in Britain in the 1990s

The mafia boss fled Italy for Britain in 1993 and lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner, raising a family with his English wife Ann, the daughter of a former Italian consul to London. 

She was in the public gallery and watched the brief hearing alone. Rancadore's extradition hearing will take place on February 20.

A European Arrest Warrant for Rancadore was first lodged in January 2012.

His lawyers had argued that sending him back to Italy would be in contravention of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Under the law no person should suffer 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' while incarcerated.

Last year's decision not to extradite Rancadore came a week after the High Court rejected reassurances by Italian authorities that Hayle Abdi Badre, wanted by a Florence court for breaking finance rules, would not breach his rights.

District Judge Howard Riddle, ruling on Rancadore's case, said that judgement was binding despite finding that the extradition was 'compatible with the defendant's convention rights, including prison conditions'. 

Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct.

Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection.

Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere).

Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges.

It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money.

Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.

The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.
