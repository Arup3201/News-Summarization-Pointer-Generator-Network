The illustrious artist, CJ Hendry has made a prominent name for herself when she sold one of her pieces to Kanye West, but she has just completed a brand new venture - and it's delicious.

The 27-year-old from Brisbane has pushed her artistic limit by locked herself in a room for 50 consecutive days to produce an artwork every 24 hours and publishing them to her social media accounts as proof.

The hyper realistic images are part of her Melbourne-based exhibition '50 foods in 50 days,' which was coined after CJ read accounts from inmates who were on death row.

She admits that the drawing of the octopus was the most laborious to complete in the time frame

Each image depicts food items such as M&M's placed on a luxurious porcelain Hermes plate 

CJ uses felt tip pens and a sketching style that incorporates scribbling tiny circles to get the desired effect

She was inspired to create 50 meals on stunning Hermes plates, to juxtapose the luxurious platters with basic food items, believing that if she were ever to be served a final meal, she would want it one of these plates.

The images depict food items such as Doritos, M&M's, liquorice allsorts, assorted seafood and even fortune cookies on lavish porcelain dinner plates.

According to Broadsheet, each image has been hand drawn by CJ with felt-tip pens onto 75 x 75 cm canvases and cost $8800.

However, every single piece – which adds up to half a million dollars in artwork, has already been sold to destinations all over the world, some even being sold before she started them.

Each piece costs $8800, however all the pieces have been sold prior to the Melbourne exhibition

The 27-year-old from Brisbane has sold drawings to the likes of Kanye West, Vera Wang and David Caruso

Before methodically drawing the images, CJ takes up to 100 photographs of the items in different lighting 

The beauty is in her attention to detail, with each image comparable to a black and white photograph

CJ advertises her pieces to her 200,000 followers on Instagram on other social media platforms

14 have gone to Hong Kong, four have gone to Singapore and the rest to America, the United Arab Emirates, London or remained in Australia. 

The beauty in CJ's work is the unique attention to detail, with every image comparable to a black and white photograph.

She has admitted that her technique involves scribbling in little circles to get the desired effect.

Her images rose to fame a mere two years ago with her journey being nurtured by the founder of the design blog The Cool Hunter, Bill Tikos.

CJ began by drawing images of crumpled Chanel and Prada shopping bags as well as everyday static items such as boots, boxing gloves and playing cards.

Interest in her pieces has mostly been through Instagram, as her 200,000 followers has given her a wide audience to advertise to.

As well as Kanye West, she has sold pieces to celebrities like Vera Wang and David Caruso and some images have gone for $50,000.

For each piece, CJ takes up to 100 photographs of the items placed in different lighting and positions.

She then methodically copies the photographs using shading techniques.

Her '50 foods in 50 days' exhibition will run from March the 27th to April the 12th at a pop-up gourmet food store at 166 Gertrude St. Fitzroy in Melbourne.
