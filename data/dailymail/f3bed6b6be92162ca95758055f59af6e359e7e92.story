Referendum: Lord Owen says the deepening eurozone crisis means that Britons should be asked urgently whether the UK is better off out of the EU

Britain has the perfect opportunity to break from the 'shackles' imposed by Brussels as members like Germany close ranks to form a 'single country called Europe', Former Labour Foreign Secretary Lord Owen has said.

And to ensure Britain looks after itself, the electorate must be asked two simple questions, would the UK be better off leaving the EU, or staying and joining the euro, he said.

As the eurozone faces its biggest ever crisis, he said now is the perfect time to act decisively over the UK's future in Europe.

'A referendum on the future of Europe is inevitable at some point between 2013 and 2016 at the latest,' he wrote in The Times.

It came as Chancellor George Osborne again resisted calls for a snap in-out referendum.   

Today Britain's Foreign Secretary from 1977-79 said the UK would be better off cutting links with Brussels to join a wider single market to include non-EU members like Turkey and Iceland, which he calls the 'European Community'.

This, he told The Times, has to happen 
because Britain's vision for an EU of no further integration and 
Germany's wish for near-complete integration are incompatible.

Lord Owen, who is the most senior British political figure to back a referendum so far, believes Eurozone members are squeezing together to form a group that is 'to all intents and purposes, though not in name, a single government.'

'In the UK, but also in some other countries, there are growing public demands for a consistent position to resist any further merging of the two models,  because the people in these countries to remain self-governing, in that they are determined to retain their own currency and remain in control of their own foreign, defence and fiscal policies,' he said.

'Yet these same countries see the argument for greater integration within the eurozone to help resolve the continued crisis. The way these issues can be resolved Europe-wide is to enable those countries who wish to integrate further to do so and allow those countries who do not ever envisage becoming part of the eurozone to remain in a restructured single market.'

Key areas that have been handed over to Brussels in the past, like agriculture and fishing as well as foreign, security and defence policy, would go straight back to Westminster, he said

Reforms: Privately George Osborne is said to be pro-referendum but today he refused to be drawn on an urgent vote as the eurozone reshapes itself to survive

Lord Owen makes these warnings in his new book, 'Europe Restructured', which says David Cameron and Ed Miliband will have to promise one between now and 2016.

Chancellor George Osborne, who is also David Cameron's campaign adviser, is said privately to be backing a referendum as a huge proportion of Tory members want it written into their 2015 general election manifesto.

But speaking this morning he resisted Lord Owen's calls saying that a vote would only be triggered if British sovereignty was threatened and the question would be based on an individual treaty, not a straight in-out poll.

'The British people would be concerned if there was any transfer of power, ' he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.

'A reshaped relationship with Europe would involve a transfer of sovereignty or powers to Brussels. I think we have a very clear safeguard in the system now, thanks to this Government, which is, if there is any transfer of power from this country, transfer of competence or transfer of sovereignty from this country to the European Union then there will be a referendum.

'That is not something that happened at the time of the Lisbon treaty and the constitution, that’s not something that happened at the time of the Maastricht treaty.

'We have now put right that, ensuring in law there is this referendum lock, and as I say, people did not really notice the passage of this law about a year ago, but I think it’s one of the most significant things this Government has done.'

Tory Andrea Leadsom, co-chair of the Fresh Start group of MPs, said the euro crisis was a 'perfect opportunity' to renegotiate Britain’s position in the EU.

'This isn’t about profiting from the eurozone’s hardship - it’s about facing up to the reality of the damage the EU is doing to our economy and our civil society and showing the single-mindedness to do something about it,' she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

Her plan would involve the 'nuclear option' of defying EU rules if it was in the interests of the UK.

Tory Douglas Carswell will attempt to use a private member’s bill to repeal the legislation which led to the UK joining the European Union.

He said: 'Getting Britain out of the EU is legally straightforward. Economically, it is increasingly desirable.

'Politically, it is no longer easy to dismiss as pie-in-the-sky.'

Meanwhile with the eurozone in meltdown David Cameron will tell German leader 
today Angela Merkel to put her country's full weight behind an ‘immediate’ rescue plan for 
the euro or start planning for the break-up of the single currency.

'Shackles': Britain has the chance to break from Brussels, Lord Owen says, and take back many of its policy decisions in the process

The
Prime Minister is due in Berlin for crisis talks with the German 
chancellor as fears grow about the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone because Spain is edging closer to a £100billion bailout of its banks  and is running out of money.

Mr Osborne said today the decision on whether to use bailout funds to bailout Spanish banks would not involve British taxpayers' money.

'First of all it’s eurozone money, and the reason that’s important for me and for this country is that it is not British taxpayers’ money, and as a result I think we have to respect the fact the eurozone need to make their own decisions about how exactly they get money into the Spanish banks, and the conditions they attach to that.

'Spain need to restructure their banking system, they need the resources to do that, and how exactly that is done, as I say, must be a matter for the Spanish government and the eurozone.'
