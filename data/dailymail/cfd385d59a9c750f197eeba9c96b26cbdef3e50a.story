Steven Gerrard can remember the hours he spent searching for his name on the internet when he was on the verge of a £50million move to Chelsea during Euro 2004.

‘I used to go to my room and read the papers and go on the internet... I was driving myself mad thinking about whether I should go to Chelsea or not,’ he has recalled of that time.

The uncertainty scrambled his brain and Gerrard’s weak back-pass in the opening group game against France helped gift Jacques Santini’s side victory.

Distraction? Frank Lampard has not yet signed a new deal at Chelsea and could be on his way to the MLS

Affect: Steven Gerrard remembers how being linked with Chelsea affected him during Euro 2004

Despite Roy Hodgson wanting no talk of transfers surrounding his England players now they have started their World Cup training camp, the futures of seven of the 23-man squad are not yet settled…

GOALKEEPER Fraser Forster (Celtic)Club interested: TottenhamEstimated value: £4m

DEFENDER Luke Shaw (Southampton) Clubs interested: Manchester United, ChelseaEstimated value: £27m

MIDFIELDERS Adam Lallana (Southampton) Clubs interested: Liverpool, Manchester UnitedEstimated value: £25m

James Milner (Manchester City)Clubs interested: Arsenal, LiverpoolEstimated value: £10m

Frank Lampard (Chelsea)Clubs interested: New York City, QPREstimated value: Free

STRIKERS Rickie Lambert (Southampton) Club joining: LiverpoolEstimated value: £4m

Danny Welbeck (Manchester United) Club interested: TottenhamEstimated value: £15m

On Sunday, as England’s World Cup squad arrived in Miami for the second phase of their preparations, this familiar issue was dominating the agenda again.

At least four England players — vice-captain Frank Lampard, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert — are involved in decisions over their club futures.

Which brings us to head coach Roy Hodgson and his claim that ‘when we’re together, it’s England and purely England and we’re not going to combine the two things’. Already the lines are blurred.

The clubs should be showing the national team more respect ahead of the World Cup. England is all that should count.

Hodgson has banned agents from the team hotels, but he is well aware that the players’ mobile phones will be buzzing when they retire to their rooms.

There is already some wriggle room, though, and Hodgson will let players have medicals during their seven-day stay in Miami.

Lampard’s £150,000-a-week contract with Chelsea expires on June 30 and a move to Major League Soccer is under consideration. He has an offer from Chelsea for another season and manager Jose Mourinho wants the midfielder to start his coaching badges.

At 35, Lampard is equipped to handle the situation better than most, but it is still a distraction as he prepares to captain England against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium here in Miami on Wednesday.

Focus: England boss Roy Hodgson will have to keep his players' minds on the job in hand despite transfer rumours

Uncertain: Southampton pair Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are being linked with big-money moves

Then there is the Southampton Three. Lambert’s move to Liverpool for a knockdown £4m is almost complete. He was given permission by Hodgson to travel to Merseyside on Saturday for a medical and the transfer is expected to be completed today.

Lallana played on with a groin strain in the final two matches of Southampton’s season because he was so desperate to say goodbye to the supporters.

His heart is set on a move to Liverpool (Lallana was an Everton fan growing up) to play Champions League football. There is much to discuss but he has been made aware Brendan Rodgers intends to play him in a role behind Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez next season.

London bound? Fraser Forster has been linked with a move to Tottenham

Linked: Danny Welbeck is another player being mooted to join Maurico Pochettino at White Hart Lane

Shaw, the junior member of the England squad, is expected to leave St Mary’s for Manchester United after the World Cup.

What counts for England is getting all four to focus on international football. That, as Gerrard illustrated at Euro 2004, is easier said than done.
