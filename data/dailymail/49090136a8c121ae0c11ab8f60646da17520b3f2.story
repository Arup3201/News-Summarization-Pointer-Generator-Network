Reporters didn't want to hear about changes to Obamacare or the Keystone XL pipeline on Wednesday, opting instead to kick off House Republicans' first press conference of 2015 with questions about the white supremacy scandal that threatens to swallow Majority Whip Steve Scalise whole.

House Speaker John Boehner introduced a parade of GOP luminaries to push his legislative agenda but the event quickly devolved into his worst nightmare before he offered his own defense of his third-in-command.

'I know what's in his heart,' the speaker said. 

'He's a decent, honest person who made a mistake. We've all made mistakes.'

'WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES': House Speaker John Boehner defended Rep. Steve Scalise on Wednesday in a press conference that was more like a reporters' scrum

'I REJECT BIGOTRY': Scalise is standing his ground and aims to remain Majority Whip, the third-highest ranking GOP position in the lower chamber of Congress

The press briefing started nearly 90 minutes late, and Boehner cut off questions after less than 15 minutes.

It was his first confrontation with reporters over the damaging revelations since Scalise apologized in a statement for the speech, which he characterized as an unintentional lapse in a frayed and inconsistent vetting process.

Scalise said after the story broke that when he was a more lowly state legislator he didn't have adequate staff to screen groups that asked him to deliver remarks.

And besides, he added, his practice was to speak to any group of constituents who would hear his message against an unpopular tax proposal that was made law and later repealed.

Boehner himself said Wednesday that when he was in the Ohio legislature, 'I had a half of a staffer. You get asked to speak to a lot of groups.' 

Scalise spoke for himself.

'I reject any form of bigotry, bigotry of all kinds,' he said in response to a question about the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a group with strong ties to the infamous Louisiana Ku Klux Klan founder David Duke.

Scalise referred reporters to his statement last month, in which he said the speech he gave was 'a mistake I regret.'

'I think that's where the story ends,' he insisted.

House Republican leaders have yet to address a story line that emerged shortly after Scalise confirmed that he had delivered the tax speech in 2002.

Kenny Knight, the former Duke aide who reserved the hotel hospitality suite where he spoke, said the meeting was for a civic association, not EURO. 

The two meetings were held in the same room, he said, hours apart.

Scalise's speech, Knight recalled in an interview with The Daily Beast, was sandwiched in between a Red Cross presentation about CPR and a sheriff's department talk about local crime watch programs.

FEEDING FRENZY: The first three questions – half of those Boehner's team took – were about the allegations of racism lodged against Scalise

But the White House has seized on the event to cast doubt on Republicans' ability to run both houses of Congress with Scalise as part of the leadership structure. 

'Who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday.

Earnest made special mention of a 20-year-old comment attributed to Scalise, who reportedly told a constituent that he was 'David Duke without the baggage.'

Scalise did not directly deny making that claim, but emphasized that 'I reject bigotry of all kinds.'
