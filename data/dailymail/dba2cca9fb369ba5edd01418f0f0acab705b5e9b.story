'Robin was a gifted actor and comedian, but he was also a true friend and supporter of our troops.

From entertaining thousands of service men and women in war zones, to his philanthropy that helped veterans struggling with hidden wounds of war, he was a loyal and compassionate advocate for all who serve this nation in uniform. 

'He will be dearly missed by the men and women of DoD - so many of whom were personally touched by his humor and generosity.'

U.S. president Barack Obama paid tribute to Williams on Tuesday for his work with the American forces. 

In a statement, Mr Obama said: ‘Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between.

'But he was one of a kind.

‘He arrived in our lives as an alien – but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry.

'He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most – from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalised on our own streets.'

He concluded: ‘The Obama family offers our condolences to Robin’s family, his friends, and everyone who found their voice and their verse thanks to Robin Williams.’
