Security: The Duchess with a protection officer 

Security around the Duchess of Cambridge appeared to have been stepped up as she was guarded by Taser-wielding personal protection officers.

Her Scotland Yard bodyguards, including those in plain clothes, were seen wearing the controversial stun guns for the first time in addition to the conventional firearms they usually carry.

The officers were also thought to be wearing stab vests.

Onlookers noted that there appeared to be more back-up officers and police outriders accompanying Kate than normal.

With the level of threat from international terrorism in the UK classed as severe, it is clear that the Metropolitan Police are taking no chances with the six-month pregnant duchess and other senior members of the Royal Family.

There had already been high-level talks about issuing members of the Royalty and Diplomatic Protection Squad with Tasers following a series of security alerts.

These included an attack by a mob on a car carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during the London riots in 2010, which saw the window of the Rolls Royce smashed and Camilla poked with a stick.

Until recently Tasers had only been used by officers guarding royal premises or on ‘mobile patrol’.

But a new directive recommended that firearms officers should also be given ‘less lethal weapons’.

The stun guns were first introduced in a very limited way to police forces in 2003. Guidelines say the weapon can be used only when officers face violence or a threat of violence so severe that they need to use force to protect themselves. 

Tasers fire a dart which can deliver an electric charge of 50,000 volts, rendering a suspect helpless for at least 20 seconds. They have a range of 21ft.

Under the 1968 Firearms Act, the stun guns are considered dangerous enough to be classed as ‘prohibited weapons’. Civilians caught in possession of one can be punished by up to ten years in prison.

The use of Tasers by police has been condemned by human rights groups who argue that the devices cause intolerable suffering and even death.

Police wearing the £750 X26 Tasers were spotted in the run-up to the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. But yesterday was the first time officers guarding the Duchess of Cambridge have been seen wearing them clipped on their belts in ‘quick-draw’ holsters.

Kate, who is expecting her second child in April, was visiting an event held by the Fostering Network in Islington, North London.

She sported a £169 brown silk dress by high street store Hobbs, which is not designed for maternity use. It is the third time she has worn the outfit in public.

At a tea party to meet children who have benefited from fostering, the duchess seemed taken by a rosy-cheeked six-month-old called Naya whom she called ‘sweetie pie’ and compared to her own 18-month-old son, saying: ‘She’s chubbier than George.’

‘It’s really so fantastic what you are all doing, supporting all these kids and giving them these opportunities. Well done,’ she added.

Kate said she was keen to learn more about the work of foster parents who provide homes for vulnerable children and young people.

She has no official link with the organisation but it is hoped that she might forge one in future.

The duchess met carers and social workers before a more informal reception yesterday to hear more about what fostering involves.

More than 63,000 children are currently being fostered in Britain, many of whom have experienced neglect and abuse, or have witnessed domestic violence or substance misuse.

But at least 8,600 new foster families are desperately needed, particularly those who can offer a home to teenagers, disabled children and groups of brothers and sisters.
