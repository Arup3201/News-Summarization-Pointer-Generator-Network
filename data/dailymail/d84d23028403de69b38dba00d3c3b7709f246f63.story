'I'm sure there will be no problem with Ancelotti's renewal, but this will be negotiated at the end of the season.

'We only speak about renewing contracts at the start or at the end of the season.

'Ancelotti treats all of his players as a family and that is noticeable.

'But I have the same fondness with all the coaches that I've had, from (Vicente) Del Bosque to Ancelotti.'

Ancelotti joined Real from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2013 to replace Jose Mourinho.
