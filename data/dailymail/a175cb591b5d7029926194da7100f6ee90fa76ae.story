A local businessman has become involved in a bitter dispute with his realtor after he claims he almost moved into a property built ontop of a notorious child-sex and murder den.

Nir Golan had placed his deposit down and was packed and ready to move to the seaside town of Seabrook, near Houston, when he discovered his home was built on the site locals call 'Murder Mansion'.

Indeed, Golan claims that his realtor dropped the leasing price so low he couldn't refuse it, but now is battling to get his money back because he thinks the home might be haunted.

Murder mansion: This is the property at the center of a lease dispute in Texas - which was on the site of a previous home which saw a gruesome killing

'A lot of people say there's shadows of children,' said Golan to KHOU.

'People say that they wouldn't come to my house as a guest.'

The horrifying past of the property the home was built on dates back to 1984 and Texan millionaire Bill List, who built a massive mansion on the site.

He would pick up young teenage boys and house them in exchange for sexual favors.

However, one night, the children rebelled and shot and killed List.

Afterwards, the home was torn down and the property was subdivided.

But, Golan's realtor neglected to mention any of the terrible history.

'I said let me tell you something. If you paid me money, I would not move there. It's against my religion. You cannot force me to move there,' said Golan to KHOU.

Golan claims it does not matter where the murders take place, just that they did on the land.

'There was a murder, but the murder wasn't in this house. It was on the property. And I'm trying to explain to him to me it doesn’t matter. A property is your front yard, your backyard,' said Golan.

A neighbor and former HOA president told KHOU that everyone knows the story of the Murder Mansion.

'It was 30 years ago. I mean it didn’t bother me to the point, I mean, I was gonna buy the old murder mansion and redevelop it. So you know people die all the time,' said Larry Neu.

Interior and movie: The mansion was enormous inside with its own garden and the gruesome killing had its own movie made (right)

Dining room: List would reportedly cruise Houston looking for young teen boys and bring them back to his sprawling mansion and offer them board and drugs in exchange for sex before they ganged up and killed him

While the homeowner had agree to terminate the lease, they will not return the deposit - a decision that infuriates Golan.

Golan tells KHOU he is planning to sue to get his money back but a lawyer said he is on shaky ground.

'That law in Texas is clear. There is not a duty to disclose in most circumstances. And on the issue of religion, there is no duty of the seller to be a mind reader and guess the religious objections a renter could have,' said Gerald Treece, a professor at the South Texas College of Law.
