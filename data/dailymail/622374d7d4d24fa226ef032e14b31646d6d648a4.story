Caroline Criado-Perez was the victim of an online 'avalanche' of abuse after supporting a campaign calling for women to appear on banknotes. Two people will face charges in relation to comments made on Twitter

A man and a woman are to appear in court after sending threatening messages on Twitter to a woman campaigning for females to appear on banknotes.

Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo will be charged with improper use of a communications network for their roles in the 'avalanche' of abuse directed towards Carolina Criado-Perez, the Crown Prosecution Service has revealed.

The journalist received a torrent 
of death threats and sexist remarks alongside other female campaigners after calling for women to 
be featured on banknotes.

Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said: 'Following early consultation with the police, the CPS has been asked to make a charging decision in respect of five suspects whom it is alleged sent offensive tweets to Stella Creasy MP and journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez.

'We reviewed these cases in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and guidelines issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media.

Sorley, 23, and Nimmo, 25, will face charges in Westminster's Magistrates Court on January 7.

Detectives ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute one suspect, while another who is accused of sending offensive messages to Stella Creasy MP will avoid sentencing as prosecution 'would not be in the public interest'.

'In relation to the fifth suspect, we have asked the police to carry out further investigation before a charging decision can be made,' Mr Ubjey added.

'We have written to both Ms Creasy and Ms Criado-Perez to inform them of these decisions.'

Ms Criado-Perez responded to the news online, writing on Twitter: 'Well that’s pretty awesome. CPS informing press about charges ahead of me.

'About the level of victim-support I’ve grown to expect.'

Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, was also 
targeted when she came to the defence of Ms Criado-Perez, who allegedly 
received an 'avalanche' of abuse after leading a campaign for women to 
be featured on bank notes.

Twitter faced questions about the way it handled the sustained campaign of abuse against the two women who used the micro-blogging site to call for a woman's portrait to feature on a £10 note.

Over 60,000 people signed an online petition calling for Twitter to take action against the abuse, prompting the website to launch a 'report abuse' button on its latest iPhone app.

Speaking in July, the company's general manager for the UK said: 'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of the rules.

'Also we are testing ways to simplify reporting, e.g. within a Tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web.

'We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report form (sic)'.

It was announced in July that Jane Austen
 would be featured on the new note, after a plan to put Winston 
Churchill on £5 notes would eliminate the presence of women.
