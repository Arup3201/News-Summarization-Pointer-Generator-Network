It’s easy to lose track of time perusing the planet from the air using Google Earth.

From mysterious markings in the Nevada desert, crop circles, religious messages and even corporate logos etched into fields and rocks in Chile, strange sites that only reveal themselves from a birds-eye-view are scattered across the world.

Natural phenomena including a heart-shaped lake in Ohio and the ‘Badlands Guardian’ – a strange rippling in the land that looks like a face – in Alberta Canada, are clearly visible from the air.

A collection of the ‘strangest’ sites found on the massive interactive map include man-made wonders such as giant animal carvings in rock and a psychedelic guitar-shaped forest planted in Argentina .

A farmer called Pedro Martin Ureta planted 7,000 cypress trees to create the shape in the fertile agricultural region of Argentina's 'Pampas' in memory of his wife.

Markings of concentric circles on fields and strange geometric patterns in the desert might have alien believers and conspiracy theorist scratching their heads and looking for information about how the artworks were created.

It appears as if people are trying to take advantage of Google Earth as a way of spreading messages, as one site shows that people have carved ‘Jesus loves you’ into the landscape of Idaho, while a Turkish flag is painted onto a hill in Cyprus to make a political point.

Someone in Chile must really love Coca Cola. The logo seems to be sculpted in sandy soil in Arica, Arica y Parinacota, Chile

Corporate logos for Mozilla Firefox and Coca Cola have also been spied from high above the clouds.

The sites were curated by website Twisted Sifter, which also collected views of less mysterious locations, such as giant airplane parking lots, a swastika-shaped building in California and huge herds of animals on the run in Tanzania.

In the past week it has been revealed that a distinctive circular pattern made from sand in the Egyptian desert is an environmental art installation.

It was spotted from above and some people thought it could be anything from a landing strip for alien spacecraft to an ancient monument to the gods.

It appeared in 1997 and has been baffling tourists and users of Google earth ever since.

The design, which measures over one million square feet, was created by artists Danae Stratou, Alexandra Stratou and Stella Constantinides to celebrate 'the desert as a state of mind, a landscape of the mind’.

This strange pattern can be found in a desert in China and might have alien believers and conspiracy theorists scratching their heads about what it might be and how it was created

‘Desert breath’ features two interlocking spirals, one with vertical cones and the other with conical depressions in the desert floor.

It was originally designed with a small lake at its centre, but recent images on Google Maps, show the lake has since emptied.

A giant swirling design etched into the Egyptian desert could trick the eye into thinking an alien spacecraft has landed. But the mesmerising pattern is, in fact, the work of three artists
