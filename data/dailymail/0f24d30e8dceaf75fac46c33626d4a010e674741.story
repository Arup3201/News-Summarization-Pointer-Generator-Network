NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism in the wake of his own admission on Wednesday that he lied about being aboard a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire during the Iraq war.

Despite a swift apology on his Nightly News program, Williams is at the center of a media firestorm after it emerged that his old war story that he has retold numerous times over the past 12 years has become increasingly exaggerated.

Williams was forced to apologize this week after claiming in a report on Friday that the chinook he was aboard in Iraq had been hit by enemy fire.

NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism after he admitted to lying over an old Iraq war story

New Orleans' famous French Quarter escaped flooding during Hurricane Katrina as it is located on the highest part of the city 

On Wednesday Williams blamed his mistake on the 'fog of memory over 12 years', but evidence has emerged since that Williams has repeatedly mis-told the story including to late night host David Letterman in 2013.

The anchor's previous credibility as a highly regarded journalist is based partly on his reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.

The major story broke just months after Williams replaced Tom Brokaw as NBC News' anchor and his reporting from the devastation of New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award.

In the wake of the scandal over William's war story apology, attention is now turning to comments he made about what exactly he witnessed in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.

'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country...I beat that storm. I was there before it arrived. 

'I rode it out with people who later died in the Superdome,' he said in an interview in 2006, just a year after the hurricane.

The story was first broken by the GotNews.com news blog. 

Williams' reporting from New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his Iraq war story climb down 

According to the New Orleans Advocate, Williams claim isn't accurate as the French Quarter of the city – one of the highest parts of the city – was never flooded.

The Advocate has also taken Williams to task over another Katrina-related claim that he made in an interview last year with her predecessor Brokaw.

In the interview Williams claims that he had caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters during his stay in New Orleans.

'My week, two weeks there was not helped by the fact that I accidentally ingested some of the floodwater,' he said.

'I became very sick with dysentery, our hotel was overrun with gangs, I was rescued in the stairwell of a five-star hotel in New Orleans by a young police officer. We are friends to this day. And uh, it just was uh, I look back at total agony.'

Those claims have also had cold water poured on them.

The anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005

'I saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises and such, but I don't recall a single, solitary case of gastroenteritis during Katrina or in the whole month afterward,' Dr. Brobson Lutz, a former city health director told the Advocate.

A spokeswoman from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said contaminated water sources are a possible 'transmission points' for dysentery, but that the agency doesn't track it.

Elsewhere, conservative blog, SooperMexican, posted video clips on Thursday that apparently showed Williams telling two completely different stories about a New Orleans man who committed suicide during the Katrina.

One clip from the Brokaw interview has Williams claim that he personally witnessed the death, while in a second clip, Williams said he 'heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck' of the New Orleans Superdome.

In the same interview with Brokaw, he praised Williams, saying that with his reporting during Katrina, Williams 'took ownership, if you will, of the anchor chair' following a longtime stint as Brokaw's understudy. 

In a 2014 interview with Tom Brokaw, right, Williams claimed that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters in New Orleans - a claim that experts have said is highly unlikely
