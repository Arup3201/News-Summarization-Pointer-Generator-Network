Families of July 7 bombing victims and soldiers killed by ‘friendly fire’ have condemned the Government’s secret justice plans as a ‘dictator’s charter’.

They said proposals to hold inquests and civil cases behind closed doors could rob families of the right to see justice done.

They join a chorus of concern expressed by politicians of all parties about Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke’s plan to allow ‘sensitive’ cases to be heard in private.

The reforms, detailed in a Green Paper on justice and security, would grant the state ‘dictator’ powers and allow the security services to hush up their mistakes, said Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was killed in the Edgware Road blast on July 7, 2005.

Many of the failings by MI5 and the police over the London bomb atrocities could still be shrouded in secrecy were it not for the public inquest.

Both organisations had been previously cleared of blame for the bombings by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee.

Mr Foulkes said: ‘The Green Paper doesn’t contain adequate safeguards to prevent the state abusing the powers it would have.

‘Our experience of MI5 gave us some insight into the ability of MI5 to cry “national security” and the politicians to roll over and play dead.

‘The Intelligence and Security Committee was misled by MI5, so MI5 got away with attempts to hide their errors.

‘Giving agents of the state the powers of a dictator and dressing it up as being in the interests of the state is not right.’

Helen Perry, whose Royal Military Policeman son Michael Pritchard was accidentally shot by a British Army sniper, said: ‘The plans for secret court cases are appalling, the public needs to hear what is said. Many things have come to light that have led to changes such as the lack of body armour for soldiers.’

The inquest into the death of 22-year-old Lance Corporal Pritchard in December 2009 is due to be held in May, before the Government’s plans would come into effect.

But Mrs Perry, 49, from East Sussex, is angered that cases like her son’s could be held in secret.

She said: ‘I would be devastated if I was denied access to the inquest into my son’s death. It’s essential to me that we get to the truth. I don’t think they have the right to keep this information from me. These new rules aren’t needed. I understand there are certain parts of Michael’s inquest that need to be kept secret because of the nature of his job.

‘But the current rules mean that people can give evidence behind screens or that certain things are heard in private, there is no need for change.’

Clifford Tibber, the lawyer 
representing many 7/7 survivors and families of the victims, said of the
Government’s proposals: ‘It is a shocking idea for so many reasons.

‘The unprecedented openness of the evidence in the 7/7 inquests has improved, rather than harmed, national security.

‘The coroner was able to make recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the security service.

‘The
Government’s proposals are a cynical, self-serving attempt to defeat 
legitimate claims and stifle the revelation of facts to which the public
are entitled.

‘The 
Government says that the proposals are the only way there can be a fair 
trial when evidence involving issues of national security is involved. 
While that may be true for the Government, it means that other parties 
who are denied access to that evidence cannot possibly have a fair 
trial. They will not see or hear the evidence and will not have an 
opportunity of testing it.’

The conduct of the security services was also exposed in the case of Binyam Mohamed, the British resident tortured at Guantanamo Bay.

The Government fought and lost a lengthy legal battle to keep secret what a judge eventually called Mr Mohamed’s ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’.

Clare Algar of the campaigning legal charity Reprieve, which represented Mr Mohamed, said: ‘The real driver for the Government’s plans is not national security, but political embarrassment.

‘They are seeking to abolish the very legal method by which we first found out that Britain had become mixed up in some of the worst excesses of the “war on terror”.

‘The proposals would leave ministers in effect immune from having to answer for their mistakes, so long as they made the claim that “sensitive information” was involved.’

The Justice Ministry has defended its proposals on the grounds that the security services have been hamstrung in defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing, because they cannot reveal secret intelligence material in open court.

But lawyers and human rights groups have countered that there already mechanisms in courts by which ‘sensitive’ evidence can be heard in secret.
