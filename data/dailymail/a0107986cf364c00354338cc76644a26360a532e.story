A Pakistani Taliban group has taken taken responsibility for the deadly attack of a mountain climbing camp that left 11 dead including 10 foreign tourists, one of whom was an American.

Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it carried out the shooting as retaliation for the death of the Taliban's deputy leader, Waliur Rehman, in a U.S. drone attack on May 29.

The 10 foreigners who were killed included two Chinese, one Chinese-American and one Nepalese, said Attaur Rehman, home secretary in the Gilgit-Baltistan area where the attack took place. The other six have not been identified. One Pakistani was also killed.

'By killing foreigners, we wanted to 
give a message to the world to play their role in bringing an end to the
drone attacks,' Ahsan told The Associated Press by telephone from an 
undisclosed location.

The group claims to have formed a new faction specifically to launch such attacks.

The
attack took place at the base camp of Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest 
mountain in the world at 26,660 feet. It is notoriously difficult to 
climb and known as the 'killer mountain' because of numerous 
mountaineering deaths in the past.

Ultimatum: The normally peaceful, remote area in northern Pakistan has become increasingly violent and a Taliban spokesperson promised more killing of tourists will occur until drone strikes stop

The gunmen were wearing uniforms used by the Gilgit Scouts, a paramilitary police force that patrols the area, said the interior minister. The attackers abducted two local guides to find their way to the remote base camp. One of the guides was killed in the shooting, and the other has been detained and is being questioned, said Pakistani interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.

A senior government official told reporters that a large number of security personnel were sent to Gilgit-Baltistan in the wake of the shooting spree.

The government suspended the chief secretary and top police chief in Gilgit-Baltistan following the attack and ordered an inquiry into the incident, said Khan.

Dangerously high: 10 tourists and a guide were gunned down in their hotel located in northern Pakistan, at the base of the Nanga Parbat (pictured here). The remote tourist spot had been largely peaceful until recently

'The purpose of this attack was to give a message to the world that Pakistan is unsafe for travel,' said the interior minister in a speech in the National Assembly, which passed a resolution condemning the incident. 'The government will take all measures to ensure the safety of foreign tourists.'

Local police chief Barkat Ali said they first learned of the attack when one of the local guides called the police station around 1 a.m. on Sunday. The military airlifted the bodies to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, Sunday afternoon.

Global issue: Pakistani journalists stand over the coffin of a foreign tourist murdered by a group of Taliban gunmen that stormed a remote mountain climbing camp, killing 11 people from several world nations

'We hope Pakistani authorities will do their best to find the culprits of this crime,' the Ukrainian ambassador to Pakistan, Volodymyr Lakomov, told reporters outside the hospital where the bodies were taken.

Though the area where these shootings took place is relatively quiet, and considered one of the most beautiful regions of the country, this is not the first time those parts have seen violence.

The northern Pakistan province was long considered to be on of the country's most secure regions, however, recent attacks from militants targeting Shi'ite minorities have made the area volatile.
