A young teacher told he had terminal cancer married his soulmate just weeks before he lost his battle with the disease. 

Luke Williams was diagnosed with mouth cancer on his 28th birthday in June 2013.

He underwent surgery to remove half his tongue, with tissue from his forearm used as a graft.

The IT teacher was given the all-clear.

But in May, Mr Williams was dealt a devastating blow. The disease had returned and secondary tumours were growing in his lungs. 

Doctors told him he had just six months to live.

Luke Williams, 29, died on Thursday after tying the knot with his girlfriend Linda Birzniece in August. In May the IT teacher was told he had just six months to live after doctors discovered he had secondary cancer

Specialists offered him a course of aggressive chemotherapy to prolong his life, but the IT teacher opted against it.

Instead, he and his girlfriend Linda Birzniece, 25, created a bucket list of things he wanted to do before he died - top of the list was getting married.

They became husband and wife in August, but Mr Williams, from Margate in Kent, died on Thursday, aged just 29. 

Before passing away, he said: 'After I was told I had six months to live and it had sunk in, I just accepted it.

'I was at peace with it and decided I would enjoy the life I had left.'

His bucket list also included watching his beloved Liverpool FC at Anfield, flying in a hot air balloon and completing an interrailing trip around Europe.  

He also launched a fundraising campaign for Pilgrim's Hospice in Margate and Cancer Research, which has so far reached £25,000.

Andy Somers, principal of Hartsdown Academy in Margate where Luke taught, said: 'On behalf of the college, staff, students, and governors I want to highlight our sincere respect for everything Luke achieved in his life which was sadly so short-lived.

Mr Williams was first diagnosed with mouth cancer in June last year. He had an operation to remove half his tongue, with doctors using tissue from his forearm as a graft. But after being given the all-clear tests revealed the disease had returned in May

'We are cold and numb with grief, and our deep condolences go to his wife Linda, and his family and friends on this sad occasion.

'Luke was a Higher Learning and Teaching Assistant and was about to start his full teacher training, a move which delighted us as he had great promise in the profession.

'He was very popular young man with colleagues and students, and one of his greatest gifts was that he always took time to listen to people, which is critically important in education.

'Luke's fight against his cancer and his determination to wring every last positive moment from his life through his magnificent fund-raising efforts in the last three months has been an inspiration for us all.'
