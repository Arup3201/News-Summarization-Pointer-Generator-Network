Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court

Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court - by giving their evidence before the trial.

They will be allowed to record their testimony on video in advance of the case going to court, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will say today.

The move follows a series of cases in which sex abuse victims have been put through hostile questioning by defence barristers.

In one case a rape victim who was abused by a sex grooming gang from the age of 13 endured 12 days of questioning in a ‘forensic examination’.

Another vulnerable victim in the same case had to read out line by line from a police statement she gave detailing alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather.

A series of pilots will see vulnerable victims given the chance to give evidence out of court with the footage played to the jury.

The announcement will please victims’ groups who have warned that children have been ‘thrown to the wolves’ in court.

But the move could raise concerns among lawyers over whether defendants are getting a fair trial - and whether the evidence used against them is properly scrutinised.

Mr Grayling said it was wrong for young and vulnerable victims to have to relive their experiences for days on end in an ‘aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere’.

‘The particularly hostile treatment of victims and witnesses in court has nothing to do with fairness or justice,’ he said.

‘It is simply not right that young and vulnerable victims are forced to relive the most traumatic experience they have ever had, often for days on end, when cross-examined in court.

‘I am adamant we must put a stop to this, but without compromising everyone’s right to a fair trial.

‘So for the first time we are going to spare these victims from the aggressive and intimidating court atmosphere by making sure they can give evidence and be cross-examined before the trial starts.’

Details of the treatment in court of several victims of a sex grooming gang sparked fury earlier this year.

The 18-year-old, who had been attacked from the age of 13, was quizzed aggressively about her sex life during the harrowing trial over 12 days in the witness box.

She broke down after being repeatedly accused of lying by lawyers acting for seven men on trial and at one point was accused of being ‘naughty’.

One barrister reportedly walked out of the trial in disgust over the treatment of another witness at the Stafford Crown Court trial in 2011.

The seven men were convicted of child sex offences against four girls in later retrials after the case collapsed.

The pilots will take place at three Crown Courts in Leeds, Kingston-upon-Thames and Liverpool from later this year. If successful, it will be extended to courts across England and Wales.

Victims will still be cross examined, but via videolink and away from the drama and audience of a court trial, officials said.

By separating testimony from the main court case, the move could give judges greater control over methods of cross-examination.

However, there will still be no limit on the number of lawyers who can cross examine a victim or witness, how long they can be in the witness box or the material on which they can be questioned.

Officials suggested it would also ensure victims could be given counselling earlier, without the long delays often found in the courts.

The change in the law will affect all child victims and witnesses and adult victims seen as the ‘most vulnerable’, and allow them to escape a courtroom grilling in front of an audience.

Questions were raised about cross-examination when a violinist killed herself after she was branded a liar and fantasist by her attacker’s lawyer.

Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose half-way through the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer , music director at Chetham’s School of Music in the mid-1990s, and his ex-wife Kay, both 68.

Kate Blackwell, who represented Mr Brewer, told Mrs Andrade ‘you have told this jury a complete pack of lies about the visit to this house’.

During one exchange, the victim said ‘this feels like rape all over again’. A week later she was found dead at home. Her family said they were convinced the court ordeal lead to her death.

But the judge in the case said the barrister’s conduct had been exemplary and her questions ‘perfectly proper and completely professional’.

Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC said: ‘This pilot is one step towards making courts child friendly and starting to remove the gladiatorial element of cross examination. It could also mean young people won’t have to testify years after they come forward allowing victims to start to rebuild their lives earlier.

“Many young victims of abuse tell us how the current process can be almost as horrific as the abuse itself.

‘Cases have been dropped because the witnesses were too vulnerable to cope with the aggressive cross exanimation in court by several different barristers.’
