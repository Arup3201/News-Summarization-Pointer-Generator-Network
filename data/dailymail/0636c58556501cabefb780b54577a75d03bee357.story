An artist has transformed the head of a breast cancer patient into a stunning henna crown.

World famous henna artist Ash Kumar, 35, spent over an hour giving a cranial makeover to Dipika Patel - who lost her hair in a battle with the disease.

The crown was created by Ash for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in partnership with the Henna Heals project.

The project works with women who have lost their hair to promote empowerment, confidence and beauty.

Dipika Patel, from Uxbridge, London, was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2014.

The 43-year-old decided to shave her head completely after her first treatment left her hair falling out in clumps.

Dipika said: 'I think the main reason I agreed to the henna crown was to raise awareness for breast cancer in the Asian community in particular.

'It is brushed under the carpet and it isn't talked about a lot - you think its not going to happen to you.'

Dipika has been supported throughout her treatment by her husband, family and four-year-old son - but often wears a scarf out on the street to cover her shaved head.

Dipika said: 'When I was diagnosed I was very shocked and upset.

'People still think 'she's got cancer she's going to die' and it's still a lot of fear factor.

'When I start losing my hair it did upset me because it was coming out in clumps.

'All I was seeing was hair everywhere. I asked my husband to shave the rest of it off - I cried through the whole thing.

The design totally transformed Dipika, who chose to shave her head when she began to lose her hair to regain control over the disease

'I wanted to control the crisis, I didn't wanted it to control me so I chose to get rid of it in only one cut.'

Ash used natural henna, crystals and body glitter to create the stunning crown, which will last around 12 days.

Ash said: 'I don't really choose a pattern but I'm inspired more by the personality.

'I look at the colour and shade of their skin, which gives me kind of a palette to create a mood from it.

'Today I'm working on a project with Henna Heals, which is a wonderful movement.

'I created a henna crown for a wonderful lady to bring empowerment, confidence and beauty.'

She cried with delight as she described how the transformation made her feel.

Dipika said: 'It was amazing, I couldn't believe how beautiful it is, it is beyond all expectations - I can't take the smile off my face.

'I think the henna crown is very empowering and I'm going to be walking out of here without a hat on because I want everyone to see it.

'After everything you have to go through with cancer treatment something like this makes you feel beautiful.'
