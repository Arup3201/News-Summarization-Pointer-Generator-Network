Autopsies have determined that the two children discovered dead in a Detroit freezer earlier this week were beaten to death, and that the youngest child also suffered 'thermal injuries'. 

Mitchelle Blair, 35, has currently only been charged with child abuse, but that may change now that the deaths of her children Stoni Blair, 13, and Stephen Berry, 9, have been ruled a homicide. 

The autopsy comes just a day after child welfare officials said Blair's two surviving children had been terribly abused in a house of horrors.

Details of death and extreme abuse emerged Thursday as Mitchelle Blair appeared in court, two days after the bodies of her 9-year-old son, Stephen Berry, and 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Blair, were discovered

The Michigan Department of Human Services is taking steps to end Blair's rights to her two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, who are currently with a relative.  

In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron.

Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. 

Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News.  

Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers.

'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old.

In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horrors, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron 

Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said.

Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said.

Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said.

The bodies of the children were discovered on Tuesday while court officers were serving an eviction notice. 

The apartment was reportedly filled with food and trash and rendered almost 'unlivable', according to the report.  

Blair's 8-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said.

While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. 

Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states.

The surviving children did not mention sexual abuse when they were interviewed by counselors, according to a juvenile court petition.

Blair's teenage daughter said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years.

Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'.

There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official.

People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago.

Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house.

'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.'  

Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food.

She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'.

'This is just wrong,' she said in tears.

Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home on Tuesday.

'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' 

Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. 

Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. 

The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. 

Blair was referred to counseling and allowed to keep custody of her children.

The two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them, according to the state. 

Together they owe $50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. 

Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. 

She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. 

Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex.

'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 

'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.'
