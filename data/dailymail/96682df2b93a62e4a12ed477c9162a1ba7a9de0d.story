A school binder decorated with pictures of a 13-year-old's older brother and her softball team nearly led the girl being kicked out of school, her mother claims.

Seen in his military uniform, a photograph of Brianna Gentry's older brother Derrick who is stationed in Montana as a military policeman is one of several pictures on her school binder.

'My brother is very important to me. I haven't seen him in a while,' Brianna told KTLA on her reasoning behind the photo's placement.

Problem: The mother of Brianna Gentry says her daughter was nearly kicked out of school for keeping pictures of her softball team and brother in his military uniform on her binder

Long distance: Brianna says her brother is stationed as a military policeman in Montana so rarely sees him, prompting her to keep the photo of him close to her

Around him are also pictures of her softball team.

Both pictures, however, as Brianna recently learned, do not comply with her school's rules with the eighth grader's membership of their AVID programme for top or advanced students.

'The counsellor took me out of class twice telling me that the pictures aren't AVID material,' Brianna said. 'But they haven't pulled out any other students with pictures out from their class. Just me.'

According to the school, which sent a copy of AVID's rules home for her to re-read, all students must 'maintain the AVID binder with assignments, grade sheets, and daily notes as required.'

The issue: The pictures clash with her school's rules specific for their AVID programme's students which Brianna is a member of

Angry: Finding that the AVID rules don't list pictures on binders as banned, Brianna's mother wrote a letter to the school saying her daughter will keep the pictures in place

Finding school officials' argument against her daughter's photographs absurd, and not in conflict with what they had agreed to, Brianna's mother fired back.

'These items are in her binder and will remain in her binder. The contract does not say a student cannot have pictures in the outside sleeve.

'The principal told me yesterday the rule is based on interpretation. Having a neat, clean binder is a matter of opinion.

'We will follow the rules set forth which do not include the removal of photos.'

'Her brother is a positive role model in her life,' her mother Jaima Eudy told KTLA. 'Her softball team she's very active in little league, she has been for six years. So, these are things that are happy moments for her.'

Agreement: Coming to an agreement, Brianna was allowed to keep the photo of her brother in her binder but had to remove her softball team

After some back and forth, the school came to an amended conclusion this week.

'We want our students to be successful and if this is the type of motivation that is going to help this young lady or any other student succeed, then by all means we will support her efforts,' school district spokeswoman Linda Bardere told KTLA.

But the picture of her softball team still had to be removed they decided.

'I'd rather have my brother in my pictures than have nothing at all,' Brianna said. 'So, I'm fine with the decision.'
