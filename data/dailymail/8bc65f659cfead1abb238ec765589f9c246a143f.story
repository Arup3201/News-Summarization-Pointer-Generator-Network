U.S. Senator John McCain has blasted President Barack Obama for going 'A-W-O-L' and utterly failing to show leadership in the wake of the attack on Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in which 298 were killed yesterday.

Instead of heading back to Washington to discuss the crash with his national security team and address the global consequences of the possibility that it was caused by a missile attack launched by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Obama traveled to New York City.

He went to New York hours after devoting just 40 seconds to the tragedy at the beginning of a jokey 16-minute speech on transportation in Delaware.

'I don't understand this president ... 
this is what we used to call in the military A-W-O-L,' McCain told Fox 
News. 'There's a direct loss of American lives here 
and the president goes to a fundraiser? Help me out.'

There has been no confirmation of any U.S. citizens losing their lives in the crash, but a Reuters report filed yesterday amid the confusion claimed that 23 Americans had died.

McCain unleashed: The hawkish senator warned that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russia or its proxies were responsible for downing a passenger plane

Asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity if he agreed with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest that Obama's policies have 'substantially improved the tranquility of the global community,' McCain said with a straight face: 'Wherever there's a fundraiser.'

McCain also called the White House 'cowardly' for relying solely on sanctions against Moscow, rather than giving the Ukrainians weapons to help them see off the Russian-backed separatists.

The Senator had yesterday predicted that there would be 'hell to pay' if Russian involvement was proven in the outrage. Putin is believed to have been sending weapons to the rebels and the missile launcher that is believed to have blown MH17 from the sky is Russian-made.

Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus took Obama to task over attending the fundraisers. He tweeted: 'With all that is going on, the last thing the president should be doing is fundraising right now. Now is a time for leadership'.

Last night, Hillary Clinton went further than Obama or any member of the administration, saying that all indications showed the Russian-backed rebels were behind the disaster and that tough action was needed to 'put Putin on notice that he has gone too far and we are not going to stand idly by'.

In an interview with Charlie Rose on the PBS network, she said that there should be 'outrage in European capitals' and sanctions against Russia should be stepped up and the Europeans should lessen their reliance on Russian energy.

The White House said the president called Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, as well as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, as well as Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, on his flight to New York.

Obama offered Razak 'immediate assistance to support a prompt international investigation' during their chat, the White House said in a statement.

The president's first call upon landing in New York was to Secretary of State John Kerry, the White House said.

He also called his national security team, which includes CIA Director John Brennan and the president's deputy national security advisers, the White House said, and directed them 'to continue offering whatever assistance is necessary to advance the international effort to determine what happened.'

Afterward, he proceeded to the two fundraisers he was in New York to attend.

While Obama was out raising money for the Democratic Party, McCain was appearing on the news networks, issuing verbal rebukes of both Obama and Russian President Vladmir Putin.

'This
 was an airliner headed towards Russian airspace,' the Arizona 
Republican said on MSNBC. 'And it has the earmarks – and I'm not 
concluding – but it has the earmarks of a mistaken identification of an 
aircraft that they may have believed was Ukrainian.'

'If
 that's true, this is a horrible tragic event which was certainly 
unanticipated by anybody no matter who they are. And there will be 
incredible repercussions if this is the case.'

'If
 it is the result of either separatist or Russian actions mistakenly 
believing that this is a Ukrainian warplane,' McCain warned, 'I think 
there's going to be hell to pay and there should be.'

The senator's comments came as recovery workers began to pick through mounds of luggage, airplane sections and even human remains in a nine-mile debris field where the Boeing 777 went down Thursday.

He also told host Andrew Mitchell that President Barack Obama has mishandled the Ukraine crisis by going soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin and refusing to arm Ukrainian government forces.

'The United States – it has been insulting in how small and how little help we have given,' he complained. 'I mean, they have been begging us for defensive weaponry [but] we have not given it to them.'

He also slammed the White House for the shallowness of economic sanctions the U.S. has pushed on Moscow after Putin annexed a region of Ukraine that was populated mainly by ethnic Russians.

'The sanctions so far in exchange for Crimea have been minuscule,' said McCain.

'These
 latest enacted by the Obama administration, I think, are helpful. But 
if you ask the Ukrainian government that's struggling, they said they 
need weapons [with] which to defend themselves.'

McCain went directly after Putin, telling Roll Call that if the plane was fired on by 'separatists, which are also Russian, Vladimir Putin should be paying a heavy price.'

Putin on Thursday called the idea of Russian government involvement in the plane's destruction 'stupiditry' and blamed Ukraine.

'This tragedy would not have occurred if there was peace in that land,' he said, at least if hostilities had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.'

'And without question, the state over whose territory this took place bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.'

U.S. officials said Thursday that they are certain the passenger plane was shot down by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile.

The Associated Press reported that Soviet-era 'Buk' missile systems have been spotted in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist fighters.
