These hungry bears have been waiting all year for a taste of salmon, so it's no wonder they were a little spiky with one another as they competed to catch their fill of the migrating fish.

As these pictures show however, the bears soon appeared to get their paws on a bountiful catch as hundreds of fish made their way upstream at Brooks Falls, in Katmai National Park, Alaska.

Roberta McFall, a 58-year-old grandmother from Minnesota, took the images on July 7 in a once in a lifetime trip.

The annual migration of salmon from the sea upstream draws countless bears to Brooks Falls every year in the hope of catching a salmon.

The series of pictures show the bears standing in the river at the point where the salmon are forced to leap out of the water to make it up a cascade of flowing water.

Tempers flared however as a couple of the bears felt the other was encroaching on their fishing spot.

The 40-square-mile Katmai National Park is a haven for bears where they are fully protected from hunting.

Salmon is an important source of food for bears, which is why they are happy to gather together when there are abundant fish to eat.

Because of the special protection grizzlies receive their numbers are on the rise in many parts of North America.
