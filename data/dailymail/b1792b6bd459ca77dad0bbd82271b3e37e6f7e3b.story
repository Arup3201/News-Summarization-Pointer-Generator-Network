Journalists Steven Sotloff (left) and James Foley (right) have both been killed by Islamist militants in recent weeks.

Sotloff was pictured in the video delivering message taunting U.S. President Barack Obama. The Arabic text at the bottom of this frame translates to: 'Now is the time for my message'.

The Islamic State released another beheading video overnight, this time featuring U.S. journalist Steven Soltoff.

British ISIS terrorist 'Jihadi John' also killed another American journalist, James Foley (pictured here), a fortnight ago.

Here, U.S. journalist James Foley speaks to the camera in a desert wasteland prior to his beheading.

This frame from a video released by the Islamic State shows American freelance journalist Steven Sotloff shortly before his execution in an unknown desert location.

A Second Message to America:

'I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I’m sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this is the time for my message:'Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be the preservation of American lives and interests, so why is that I am paying the price of your interference with my life? Am I not an American citizen? We’ve spent billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars and we’ve lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so what are the people’s interests in reigniting war?'From what little I know about foreign policy, I remember a time when you could not win an election without promising to bring our troops back from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. Here you are now, Obama, nearing the end of your term, and having achieved none of the above and deceivingly marching us the American people in the blazing fire.'

Freelance journalist James Foley was executed by the Islamic State on August 19.

'I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government.'For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.'My message to my beloved parents: save me some dignity and don’t accept any meagre compensation for my death, from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with a recent aerial campaign in Iraq.'I call on my brother John, who is a member of the US Air Force, think about what you are doing, think about lives you destroy including those of your own family.'I call on you John, think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq recently and kill those people, whoever they may have been.'Think John, who did they really kill? And diid they think about me, you or our family when they made that decision?'I died that day John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on those people – they signed my death certificate.'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American.'
