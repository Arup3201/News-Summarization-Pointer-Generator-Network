Stabbed to death: Hassan Mahmood, 15, pictured in a park in Birmingham hours before he was killed

A 16-year-old boy was last night charged with the murder of a teenager who was allegedly standing up for his girlfriend after she was abused on Facebook.

Hassan Mahmood died in hospital after suffering a single stab wound to the back following the incident on Monday, West Midlands Police said.

The 15-year-old was attacked in Oaklands Park in South Yardley, Birmingham, at around 6pm.

West Midlands Police last night charged a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with Hassan's murder. A second 16-year-old boy has been charged with assisting an offender in connection with the incident.

They will both appear at Birmingham Youth Court today.

Dozens of messages of condolence have been posted on a memorial website set up for Hassan and flowers were left at the scene where he died.

Hassan's girlfriend left a bunch of flowers at the scene with a note which read: 'Hassan RIP - Baby I will never forget you - best boyfriend ever.

'I love you more everyday, my soldier, your princess.'

Hassan's headteacher Sohail Aslam, from the Rightrack Independent School in Saltley, Birmingham, added: 'He was a recent addition to our school.

Tribute: Hassan's girlfriend left a bunch of flowers at the scene with a note which read: 'Hassan RIP - Baby I will never forget you - best boyfriend ever'

'He had been with us six weeks but had settled very quickly and was well-liked by all the staff and students.

'He was very respectful towards everybody, we'd had no problems and he had a bright future.'

He added that the teenager had been working towards his GCSEs and loved 'sports and singing'.

Mr Aslam said the school was considering some form of tribute to Hassan, in conjunction with the boy's family.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
