The three officers involved in the death of unarmed Mexican man in Washington state fired 17 shots, including several that struck the former orchard worker but none that hit him in the back, a task force spokesman said Wednesday.

The regional law enforcement task force is investigating the killing of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, which has led to protests and calls for a federal probe.

Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender.

Authorities say a stun gun failed to subdue the man and the shooting, captured on video, appears to show the man moving away from police when he was shot. 

About one hundred friends and family members attended a funeral for Zambrano-Montes Wednesday at St. Patrick's Wednesday. 

Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin, a spokesman for the unit, said at a news conference that five or six bullets struck Zambrano-Montes. 

However, he said autopsy results were pending, and he couldn't be more specific about where the 35-year-old was shot.

Zambrano-Montes was killed Feb. 10 in Pasco, and a witness captured the gunfire on video. The death has sparked two weeks of protests in this agricultural city along the Columbia River in the southeastern part of the state.

Demonstrators have accused Pasco police of using overly aggressive tactics when dealing with those in the Hispanic community.

Protesters have equated the shooting to that of the unarmed black men killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City.

Surrender: Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender 

Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, was representing Zambrano-Montes family but the family has since received new counsel. 

The family's case has been taken up by Seattle attorney Charles Herrmann, the Latin Post reports. 

The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation into the police department's policies.

Authorities say the Mexican immigrant was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him. 

The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by the task force. The investigation is being monitored by federal authorities.

Lattin said the local investigation will be thorough and fair.

'We're not here to cover up for anybody,' he told reporters.

The killing was the fourth by police in less than a year for fast-growing Pasco, a city of 68,000 where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure.

Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics of the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to capture Zambrano-Montes.

Police said officers felt threatened. Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.
