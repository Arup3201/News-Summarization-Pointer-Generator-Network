He is doing his best to pull himself together.

But when the 40,000-piece  puzzle he had been working on for weeks collapsed on to the floor, Dave Evens was in bits.

The master craftsman had just placed the last piece into the world’s biggest hand-cut wooden jigsaw, which he had created from a montage of photos of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Magnificent: The 19ft-wide hand-cut jigsaw is a montage of highlights of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee last year

Creator Dave Evans was adjusting the jigsaw when he turned to give a passer-by directions and the jigsaw started to sag...

Five weeks' work, ruined: Mr Evans was appalled when he looked back and saw what remained of his masterpiece

The very next day, his 19ft by 8ft 
masterpiece slipped on to the floor, shattering his record-breaking 
effort in the blink of an eye.

The puzzle had been displayed on a 
frame which kept it upright at a tilt against a wall. Mr Evens was  
adjusting it when it tipped too far and slid to the ground.

A webcam set up to record his progress with the puzzle captured the moment of disaster.

'Absolute disaster': Mr Evans' wife, Margaret, who can be heard exclaiming in horror as the jigsaw fell, helps him pick up the pieces

Mr Evans asked for local volunteers to come and help him put the pieces in order so he could re-do the puzzle in time

The jigsaw is so thick that many of the pieces stayed together when they fell, but there are still several thousand scattered around

He is seen throwing a wooden baton he was holding to the floor in frustration.

His wife Margaret is  heard declaring 
‘Absolute disaster’ in the background. Mr Evens, 60, now has seven days 
to put the puzzle back together at his workshop in Weymouth, Dorset, 
before it goes on display at the Queen’s Sandringham House in Norfolk. 

Luckily he had already measured and photographed his work and sent the details to Guinness World Records.

A day from disaster: Mr Evans put the last piece in to his hand-cut masterpiece to a round of applause

The professional jigsaw-cutter had wanted to do a world record attempt for some time, and thought the Jubilee was a colourful theme

Mr Evens had spent more than 200 hours
hand-cutting the jigsaw from 6mm plywood before it  collapsed. ‘It 
seemed to happen in slow motion,’ he said.

‘It’s a fully interlocking jigsaw so 
when it fell it almost rolled down like a carpet and came down in a huge
pile on the floor.’

He added: ‘I was annoyed to say the least. I had no choice but to sit on the floor and start picking up the pieces one by one.’

Luckily Mr Evans had already measured, photographed and filmed his jigsaw for his Guinness World of Records submission

Labour of love: Mr Evans spent more than 200 hours cutting the jigsaw puzzle before he put all the 40,000 pieces together
