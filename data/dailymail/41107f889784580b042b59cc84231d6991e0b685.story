Tragic: Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997

A former Metropolitan Police chief has given evidence at a French inquiry into the death of Princess Diana to answer allegations that he suppressed evidence in the investigation into the crash that killed her.

Lord Paul Condon, the Met's commissioner between 1993 and 2000, said he - along with former assistant commissioner Sir David Veness - voluntarily offered to provide witness evidence to the French Juge d'Instruction.

The pair have long faced accusations from former Harrods boss Mohamed al Fayed, whose son Dodi also died in the August 1997 Paris crash, that they deliberately withheld evidence from the French investigation into their deaths.

Both men went to the inquiry to explain why they failed to disclose the existence of a note in which Diana predicted her own death.

Lord Condon said: 'Sir David and I volunteered to go to Paris as witnesses to help the French authorities explore and then bring to a conclusion these repeated complaints made by Mr al Fayed.

'We trust that our evidence was helpful, and we both sincerely hope that for all concerned, including Mr al Fayed, some closure can be finally brought to this tragic case.'

In 2009 a French inquiry into the investigation into Diana’s death heavily criticised the French authorities and the French state was ordered to pay almost £5,000 in compensation to Mr al Fayed.

Judges found there were problems in establishing that Henri Paul, the couple’s chauffeur who also died, was drunk at the time of the accident and a mix-up with his post-mortem examination and blood tests created unnecessary delays.

The new French inquiry is being led by Judge Gerard Caddeo, Mr al Fayed said.

Mr al Fayed’s claims that evidence was withheld centre around a letter - dubbed the Mishcon note - which was written by Diana’s divorce lawyer Lord Mishcon after an October 1995 meeting outlining her fears that there was a plot to kill her in a car crash.

In his statement issued yesterday Mr 
al Fayed said: 'His (Judge Caddeo’s) interviews of Lord Condon and Mr 
Veness are the beginning of a thorough investigation by the French 
authorities into why Lord Mishcon’s letter was not provided to the 
initial French inquiry.

'As 
the father of Dodi and a good friend of the princess, I trust that the 
outcome of these French investigations will be that those who are guilty
will be properly punished.'

Lord Mishcon passed on the letter to police in confidence following a meeting with Lord Condon after the Princess’s death.

Diana's former butler, Paul Burrell, produced a note from the princess making very similar allegations

It
was only when Diana’s former butler, Paul Burrell, produced a note from
the princess making very similar allegations in the Daily Mirror in 
October 2003 that the police agreed to hand the letter over and that 
December it was sent to the coroner investigating the princess’s death.

'Removing or concealing evidence' which could 'facilitate the discovery of a crime' is punishable by up to five years in France.

Mr al Fayed has always said he believed there had been a cover up.

A source close to the French inquiry told The Express: 'Mr al Fayed has always maintained that the evidence of Lord Mishcon has been concealed from the British coroner and the French authorities.

'It is his belief that the police  officers sat on it for six years until they were forced to disclose it following the revelations of Diana's butler Paul Burrell.

'Ever since the evidence of the note was revealed by Mr al Fayed has pressed the French authorities to investigate those responsible for its suppression.'

At the UK inquest into the deaths, Mr al Fayed implicated many establishment figures in the plot to kill or cover up the murder of the couple.
