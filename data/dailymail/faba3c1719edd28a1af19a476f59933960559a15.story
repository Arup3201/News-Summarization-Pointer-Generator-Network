Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni is set to end the uncertainty over his future by signing a new 12 month deal.

The Argentine’s position at Selhurst Park has been unclear in recent weeks with his contract due to expire at the end of the month.

Speroni has been locked in talks with Palace officials and is close to agreeing a new deal to take him into his 10th season at the club.

It is hoped Speroni will put pen to paper on fresh terms by the end of the week.

The news will come as a huge a relief to the South London club who had been fearful of Speroni leaving the club this summer.

Speroni was named the club’s player of the year last term after a string of brilliant displays to help Palace maintain their top-flight status.

Sunderland and Leicester had been interested in taking the experienced shot-stopper ahead of next season.

Manager Tony Pulis had been interested in Norwich keeper John Ruddy as a potential replacement for Speroni.
