Leon Kent, who led a group of American soldiers that knocked out five German tanks and held up the enemy advance during the Battle of the Bulge, has died. He was 99.

His family tells the Los Angeles Times that Kent had pneumonia and died on Feb. 12 in Beverly Hills.

Kent was an Army lieutenant in December 1944 when he was ordered to stop the advancing tanks in Belgium. 

Leon Kent, who was a hero at the Battle of the Bulge leading a group of men who would stop five German tanks, has died at the age of 99

The Times reports that his battery wasn't trained in anti-tank warfare and had only an anti-aircraft gun.

Nevertheless, Kent and his three soldiers destroyed five tanks in two hours and were credited with helping prevent a major German breakthrough in Belgium, allowing retreating Allied troops to regroup.

At the time, a battlefield dispatch from the AP described the scene: 

'Anti-aircraft gunners, who stayed behind when the infantry withdrew, played a vital role in preventing a major German breakthrough in Belgium. … One battery, commanded by Lt. Leon Kent of Los Angeles, knocked out five tanks, including one King Tiger tank, in two hours.'

The four soldiers received Silver Stars, although Kent's wasn't delivered until 1998 because of lost paperwork.  

While not one to boast, Kent would tell reporters he understood the danger he was in.

'If they got one shot at us, we were dead,' he said in a 2011 interview with The Times. 'I remember thinking: Do the shells go through you or do you go up in pieces?'

Kent was awarded a Silver Star for his bravery on the battlefield 

He also met Simone, the woman who would become his wife, while overseas in Paris where he married her in 1945. 

After the war ended, Kent carved out a life as a lawyer and bowling alley owner.

Kent's client list working in entertainment and copyright law was an all-star roster with actors like Clayton Moore, who played the Lone Ranger, and Lou Costello of the Abbott and Costello comedy team as well as John Wayne's wife, Pilar Wayne.

He also represented screenwriter and playwright Emmet Lavery in a copyright case.

He also worked with the dean of the UCLA law school to help admit minority students. 

He is survived by his wife and daughter, Lynette Kent, as well as a son, Paul Richard Kent, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
