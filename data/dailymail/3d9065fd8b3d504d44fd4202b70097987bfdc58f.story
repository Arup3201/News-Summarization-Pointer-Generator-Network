In the 1980s, Jane Fonda was indisputably the aerobics queen. 

The Hollywood star released her first exercise video in 1982 and promptly sold 17 million copies - she has been widely credited for launching the fitness craze that spread across America and Britain in the Eighties.

Jane, now 77, is celebrating more than 30 years in the business by publishing her entire back catalogue of VHS cassettes as DVDs and digital downloads.

Jane Fonda is celebrating more than 30 years in the fitness business. She is publishing her entire back catalogue of VHS cassettes digitally. To celebrate FEMAIL looks at the change in workout videos from the 1950s

Jane's wholesome videos are a far cry from the celebrity workouts of the Noughties - where every half-popular soap actress, pop singer or reality star claims they'll be the one to make you thin. 

The wardrobe has also taken a drastic turn, from leotards, legwarmers and perms to sleek gym gear, spray tans and false lashes

But the changes are nothing compared to the very first aerobics programmes of the1950s. 

The Jack LaLanne Show of the Fifties was thought to be the very first exercise programme and featured Jack 'at home' taking the viewers through a workout - the series ran from 1953 to 1985.

It was followed by The Debbie Drake Show - Debbie was the first woman to get her own exercise show in 1960 and continued in the role until 1978.  

The shift in the 1970s and 80s was towards skimpier clothing and group exercise in studio or beach settings.

Then in the 1990s, the likes of Mr Motivator on GMTV made producers realise that there was money to be had from tying in celebrities and exercise. 

It resulted in the shedload of DVD's since 2000 that includes anyone from Z-listers to Hollywood stars. 

But in the last few years, another phenomenon has developed - with TV stars keen to get as many sales as possible of their workout films, they are being convinced to pose in unflattering swimwear or exercise clothes in a public place.

Then around six months after the pictures are taken, the star miraculously drops the pounds and credits her new exercise video, which is available to buy in shops.  

Femail looks at some of the defining exercise videos of the last 65 years: 

 

1950s - The Jack LaLanne Show

Jack LaLanne presented fitness and exercise advice on television for 34 years, starting out as a 15-minute segment between two news programmes in 1953. 

He had the longest running fitness show on American television, with it lasting 34 years.

1960s - The Debbie Drake Show

Debbie Drake was the first female to have her own exercise show when the first episode aired of the Debbie Drake Show in 1960. 

She went on to become a huge star, writing fitness books and recording albums including Look Good! Feel Great! and How to Keep Your Husband Happy.

1970s - Sit And Be Fit

When Mary-Ann Wilson started the show Sit And Be Fit, she could never have anticiapted how popular exercising on a chair could be on television.

The idea was to make an aerobics class that would suit the elderly and people with limited mobility.

1980s - Gilad's Bodies in Motion

Gilad's Bodies in Motion was one of the biggest exercise shows of the 1980s, alongside Jane Fonda's shows. 

It took the concept of group exercise and moved it to exotic locations like Waikiki Beach (pictured below.) 

Gilad continued to produce fitness programmes until four years ago

1990s - Mr Motivator  

Fitness trainer Mr Motivator, real name Derrick Evans, first became a household name in 1993 after he was given a slot on ITV breakfast show GMTV. 

At the time, he was still calling himself by his real name, but after TV star Judy Finnigan referred to him repeatedly as the motivator, he was inspired to take on the title as a stage name. 

He left the programme in 2000 after his daughter started having health problems and the family relocated to Jamaica. 

But Derrick regularly returns to the UK for appearances as Mr Motivator and is a familiar sight on the festival circuit, where he often takes a midday slot on the main stage and helps bring hungover festival-goers back to life with a workout.

The Noughties - Celebrity workouts 

The Noughties saw an explosion in everything celebrity - no TV show, clothing store or perfume house was compete without at least one Z-list endorsement. 

The exercise video was one of the areas of entertainment most affected by this change -  year on year, more and more stars are claiming they know the way to get fit. 

Everyone from Big Brother contestants and Strictly dancers to Page Three Girls and even football WAGs has released an exercise programme. 

The saturation of the market has led to producers having to invent new ways of making the public choose their DVD over the others on the supermarket shelf. 

One of the solutions appears to be an embarrassing staged photo of the celebrity in question working out in ill-fitting skimpy swimwear and exercise clothing, while at their heaviest. 

The celebrity then loses their weight in record time and unveils their new body, compared to their old one.
