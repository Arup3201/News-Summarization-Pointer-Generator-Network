Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross admitted he would 'probably' watch child pornography after provoking outrage last month by appearing to suggest women could 'aggravate' their risk of being raped

Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross has admitted he would 'probably' watch child pornography to 'see what all the fuss is about'.

Mr Ross, 65, provoked outrage last month among campaigners against rape and on social networking sites by appearing to suggest women could 'aggravate' their risk of being raped.

He has now admitted his views were likely to get him into 'hot water' again after making comments about child pornography, as well as suggesting some cultures were more likely to commit certain crimes.

Speaking at The Telegraph Hay Festival yesterday, he said: 'I had never seen, until I started working on Crimewatch, child pornography.

'I
think if someone came to me and said: "Would you like to see what all 
the fuss is about?", I’m sorry, I probably would say yes.'

He
also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on 
links to extreme pornography even if that had not been what they had 
searched for.

He said he did not believe this meant 'we're all awful'.

He also courted further controversy when he said certain crimes were more likely to be committed by some cultures more than others.

He
claimed there was no evidence of institutional racism in the police 
force but said some West Indian communities were more likely to mug people.

Today, Mr Ross hit back at the reports, saying: 'Once again, I am being made to sound as though I am making outrageous comments.'

In
a statement to MailOnline, he said of his comments on child pornography: 'This was in the context of an 
academic experiment that showed, against expectations, most people do 
look at pornography if they stumble across it, even if they were not 
seeking it.

'My book quotes many examples of how we believe we are personally immune from things for which we blame others, but that temptation and opportunity are dangers for us all.

'For the record, I have been shown photos of child pornography by police in the Crimewatch office, so I cannot say I have never seen such images.

'I have never looked at child pornography in any other context and nor would I wish to.

Mr Ross also referred to a study which suggested internet users clicked on links to extreme pornography even if they had not searched for it

'Any report that I said, or think, that it is acceptable to view child pornography is entirely false and defamatory.

'All such images are crimes against children and any circulation of them perpetuates a dangerous problem.

'I
have devoted much of my career professionally and privately trying to 
protect people of all ages from crime, and it is highly offensive that 
anyone might be led to believe I would do anything to endanger children,
let alone in indulge in child pornography.'

Referring to his views on crime, he added: 'Today, as a result of a talk at the Hay Festival yesterday, the impression has been given that I have said different races are likely to commit different crimes.

'This is wholly untrue. I said that different cultures tend to favour different crimes. Any connection with skin colour is entirely incidental.'

'I think if someone came to me and said: 
"Would you like to see what all the fuss is about?", I’m sorry, I 
probably would say yes'

Mr Ross, who presented Crimewatch from 1984 to 2007, caused a storm of protest last month over comments about rape in his new book.

He
likened women who dressed and behaved provocatively to banks storing 
cash by the front door, or motorists leaving laptops on the back seat of
their cars.

He insisted he was not blaming 
victims – saying ‘No amount of temptation can excuse rape’ – but 
questioned whether some women chose not to pursue complaints because 
they felt partly responsible.

In
an extract from his new book, published in the Mail on Sunday, he said:
‘Rape victims were once treated appallingly, as though it was all their
fault, but have we now gone too far the other way?

‘Many
of the victims seem to think we have. The main argument of my book is 
this: we can aggravate crime by tempting fate, and we curb it by playing
safe.

‘We have come to acknowledge it is foolish to leave laptops on the back seat of a car. We would laugh at a bank that stored sacks of cash by the front door. We would be aghast if an airport badly skimped on its security measures.

‘Our forebears might be astonished at how safe women are today given what throughout history would have been regarded as incitement.

Mr Ross is famous for presenting Crimewatch with the late presenter Jill Dando

‘Not even in the licentious days of 
Charles II in the 17th Century was it acceptable for women to dress as 
provocatively as they have done in Western culture since the 1960s. 
Equally they would be baffled that girls are mostly unescorted, stay out
late, often get profoundly drunk and sometimes openly kiss, grope or go
to bed with one-night stands.’

Mr
Ross said the Mail on Sunday had misquoted him in its headline, which 
said ‘Not all women are victims and not all rape is rape’, but said the 
edited extract was fair.

Mr
Ross said the book was ‘serious, carefully researched and 
evidence-based’ and an attempt to have a reasoned debate about a 
sensitive subject.

He 
told the Daily Mail: ‘Of course I do not compare a woman to a laptop. 
That is nothing short of misrepresentation of my message.

‘What I am saying is that opportunity
and temptation are key factors in all crimes, and so far as the 
evidence goes sex crimes are no exception.

‘Far from blaming people my book says 
we are too quick to blame, and that it tends to distract us from finding
solutions to crime.’

Speaking yesterday Mr Ross urged 
critics to read his book 'Crime and How to Solve It, and Why So Much of 
What We’re Told is Wrong'.
