Covered head to toe in hair, this newborn baby is the latest addition to the aptly named Werewolf family.

The 22-day-old baby inherited a rare gene carried in her family which leads to a disorder known as Werewolf Syndrome.

Her mother Savita Sambhaji Raut, 26, said she feared for her daughter's future after she inherited the condition but accepted her fate.

And she said it did not matter what her child looked like, she would love her unconditionally.

Speaking from her home in Madhavnagar, central India, she said: 'I was so happy to have her alive, but it upsets me.'

She added: 'I am scared for her future but God has chosen us to be like this.

'I am her mother so I have to accept her and get on with life.'

Her
daughter, who is yet to be named, is one of only a few 
hundred people in the world to be born with Werewolf Syndrome.

There is no cure to the condition, otherwise known as hypertrichosis.

But this makes no difference to the tot's father Milind who said he just overjoyed to have a daughter.

The two distinct types of hypertrichosis are generalized hypertrichosis, which occurs over the entire body, and localized hypertrichosis, which is restricted to a certain area.

Hypertrichosis can be either congenital, which is present from birth, or acquired later in life.

The excess growth of hair occurs in areas of the skin with the exception of androgen-dependent hair of the pubic area, face, and axillary regions.
