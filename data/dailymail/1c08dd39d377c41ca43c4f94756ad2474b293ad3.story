Middle class families earning more than £50,000 a year will get up to £1,000 a year to pay for childcare – half what was originally planned.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has revealed the ‘squeezed middle’ will benefit from a coalition overhaul of childcare as well as parents lower down the income scale.

But the Mail has learned the plans to give parents tax breaks will now be delayed for another two months because the £1.4billion costs will have to be paid for through measures in the Budget, due on March 20.

Extra help with the huge cost of nurseries and childminders is to be extended to struggling middle class families

In another flip-flop from initial plans 
to hand £2,000 to parents, the sum will be slashed in half because the 
Treasury can’t find the money to pay for it.

A row continues in Whitehall about how
 far up the income scale the handouts should go. The childcare package 
was supposed to be announced earlier this month as part of the 
Government’s midterm relaunch.

But officials across Whitehall say Mr Osborne wants to hold on to the tax announcement in order to make it near the Budget.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he was determined to extend help with childcare bills to middle class families

Instead Education Minister Liz Truss 
will next week only unveil plans to change the regulation of childcare.

The number of children nursery staff can manage will be raised from four
 to six but those in charge of children will have to be better 
qualified.

It had been claimed that the Lib Dems 
were insisting only the poorest families will get the money. But Nick 
Clegg said he was ‘unambiguously in favour’ of giving more support to 
‘the British middle classes’ who do not feel well off when they are 
forced to spend up to 15 per cent of their income on childcare.

Officials have told the Mail that 
Tories are winning the argument that some taxpayers who pay the 40p rate
 – which kicks in at £37,000 – will get the money.

‘That is a safe 
assumption,’ said one source.

The Tories want middle class families 
to get help with childcare to offset some of the anger about the 
decision to slash child benefit.

That benefit is being reduced for 
families where one earner is on £50,000 or more and withdrawn completely
 for parents with salaries over £60,000.

Parents spend a total of £63,738 on childcare and babysitters raising a child from birth to the age of 21

Mr Clegg told the House magazine: 
‘It’s an absolute duty to try and help people, the squeezed middle if 
you like, who aren’t at the bottom.’

New figures this week showed that the 
crippling cost of bringing up a child from birth to the age of 21 has 
ballooned to an all-time high of £222,500.
