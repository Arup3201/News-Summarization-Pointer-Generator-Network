Three in 10 young people do not know that French Impressionist painter Renoir was an artist while 13 per cent think he plays football alongside David Beckham at Paris St. Germain.

In a survey by online art retailer Artfinder, six per cent of 16-24-year-olds thought Pierre-August Renoir was the prime minister of France.

One in 20 thought he won last year's Eurovision Song Contest while 12 per cent admitted they didn't know who he was.

13 per cent of the 16-24-year-olds surveyed by Artfinders thought Renoir was a teammate of David Beckham at Paris St. Germain

Some of the young people questioned though 'impressionism' was something done by comedians Rory Bremner, Alistair McGowan and Jon Culshaw instead of the likes of Claude Monet and Edgar Degas.

Almost one in 10 of those surveyed thought that 'al dente' was an art term instead of a cooking term.

The research also found that Bristol, hometown of street artist Banksy, was Britain's artiest city, with almost half of its residents owning authentic art.

In contrast, 81 per cent of residents in Belfast don't own any authentic art at all.

Britons tend to purchase mass produced prints from high-street stores (41 per cent) rather than opting for a one-of-a-kind piece (33 per cent).

Jonas Almgren, CEO of Artfinder, said: 'While we'd love the UK population to be as informed about the art world as possible, you don't have to know all about the historic greats to appreciate good art.'
