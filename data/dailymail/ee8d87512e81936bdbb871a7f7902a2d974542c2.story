A hungry feline had to be rescued by firefighters after it got its head stuck in a tin of cat food.

The distressed pet was found wandering the streets yesterday morning by a woman as she drove to church in Crawley, West Sussex, with its face poking out of the open end of a Felix tin.

Fire crews initially tried to slide its head out with washing-up liquid, but when that failed they used a tin opener and finally a ring cutter to free the animal.

Easy does it: The fire service said the 'cat was a bit scared with the tin on its head and was scratching a bit'

Tim Taylor of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘A couple of people brought round a cat with a Felix tin of cat food stuck on its head.

‘We tried a bit of soapy liquid to see if the head would slip out. When that didn't work we used a tin opener on the other end so that the cut could see and then used a ring cutter to cut the cat out of it.

‘The cat was a bit scared with the tin on its head and was scratching a bit but seemed alright once we had got it out.’

Safe: The cat, which was found in the Pound Hill area of Crawley at 8am, is now at a nearby vet's in the hope of locating a microchip and reuniting the animal with its owners

Three years ago a black cat got stuck in a Whiskas can in Fife, Scotland, and somehow made its way to an animal rescue centre where staff cut the desperate animal free.

Workers were amazed at how the cat managed to avoid being hit by a car as she made her way to the centre. They believed that the moggy was simply lost, rather than being a stray.
