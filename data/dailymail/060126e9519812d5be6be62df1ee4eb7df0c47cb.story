Twitter trolls who made rape threats against Judy Finnigan’s daughter were yesterday warned they face police action.

Her father Richard Madeley told those tormenting his family over the Ched Evans rape case: ‘Prosecution awaits you.’ His daughter Chloe, 27, said: ‘To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.’

Her mother had sparked the storm by saying footballer Evans had not physically harmed the teenager he raped in a hotel.

Madeley warned trolls they faced prosecution for threatening Chloe, right, after Finnigan's rape comments

Judy Finnegan's husband Richard Madeley warned off trolls on Twitter, saying: 'Prosecution awaits you'

The 58-year-old TV presenter said he had 'noted' every troll's threat to Chloe, adding: 'They're in deep trouble'

Appearing on ITV’s Loose Women, she argued the 26-year-old should be allowed to resume his playing career on his release from jail tomorrow because, while the attack was ‘unpleasant’, his victim was very drunk.

Campaigners said her comments perpetuated harmful myths about rape and the 66-year-old had to issue an unreserved apology.

The furore saw vile Twitter abuse directed at Chloe, including the threat: ‘Judy’s given me her blessing to rape you.’ Another tweet, directed at her mother, said: ‘Hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot.’

Chloe said: ‘My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society.

‘The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. While it may anger some that the term “non-violent rape” exists, unfortunately it does. Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable.

‘To believe that my mother is pro “non-violent rape” is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.’

Evans, 25, who was jailed in 2012 and will be released next week, has 'served his time', Miss Finnigan said

Chloe posted a note on Twitter defending her mother, and revealed she had been threatened with rape

Mr Madeley, 58, yesterday suggested the family would report the trolls to police. ‘I have noted every sick troll threat,’ said the TV presenter.

‘Do they really think it’s OK to wish/threaten rape on a woman? They’re in deep trouble, trust me.

‘Thanks to everyone who tweeted support for Judy’s intelligent, clear analysis today. Trolls who sent sick rape threats? Prosecution awaits you.’

Scotland Yard has not yet opened an investigation but social media users have been prosecuted before for attacks on high-profile figures.

Miss Finnigan yesterday said it was legally correct to describe Evans’s crime as ‘non-violent’.

‘But let me add that, to me, rape is rape,’ she added. ‘It is an appalling crime. I was simply reporting the legal facts of this case before commenting.’

Despite calls for her to be sacked from Loose Women, a spokesman for the programme said: ‘She will be on the panel next week, so that answers the question.’

The Evans case has been fought over on Twitter ever since he was convicted in 2012 of raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room in North Wales.

Supporters including his cousin breached the teenager’s right to anonymity by naming her on Twitter. Evans’s cousin and nine others admitted breaking the law and were ordered to pay her £6,000 in compensation.

Detectives in North Wales have spoken of the difficulty of tracing Twitter users who post under made-up names, and admitted that only a fraction of those who abused the girl had faced justice. 

She was forced to adopt a new identity and go into hiding.

Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted.  

Her father Karl has bankrolled the campaign, which has hired private investigator Russ Whitfield and specialist appeals barrister David Emanuel to persuade the Criminal Cases Review Commission to re-examine his conviction.

But Evans was refused leave to appeal against his conviction and failed in a challenge to his five-year prison sentence.

Last month Peter Nunn, a 33-year-old delivery driver from Bristol, was jailed for 18 weeks for using Twitter to threaten to rape Labour MP Stella Creasy in response to her backing of a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note.

Rape in Britain is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force a decade ago, replacing and refining previous legislation.

One of the key changes under the new Act was to define consent.  A person consents if they agree to have sex by choice, and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice.

Therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink, the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice, ie did not consent.

The law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent.
