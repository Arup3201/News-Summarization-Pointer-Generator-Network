Federal agents believe drug cartels have moved into Colorado and are using the recent legalization of marijuana within the state as a front to make money illegally.

Drug cartels – both from Columbia and Mexico – have suffered major revenue losses following the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado on January 1.

The Feds believe the gangs will now turn to the legal businesses in the state to find ways of making up for the shortfall in their profits. 

Federal agents believe Colorado's legal marijuana business will become a target for drug cartels who've lost money as a result of the change in the law

‘Our intelligence tells us, and all indications are (drug cartels) are going to move in if they haven't already,’ Tom Gorman, director of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, told USA Today.

In 2012 the Mexican Competitiveness Institute issued a report saying that Mexico’s cartels would lose as much as $1.425 billion if Colorado legalized marijuana.

The organization also predicted that drug trafficking revenues would fall 20 to 30 percent, and the Sinaloa cartel, which would be the most affected, would lose up to 50 percent.

Faced with such losses, the violent cartels could force their way in as black market wholesalers or simply rob pot dispensaries, which take only cash and have not been able to establish accounts with banks because of lenders' fears of violating federal laws. 

In Mexico the power of the drug cartels has created a sense of lawlessness and an increase in vigilantism, which U.S. drug officials don't think will be the case in Colorado

Agents are already gathering evidence and widespread raids take place last November targeting more than a dozen dispensaries, warehouses, homes and grow operations in the state.

Since 2005 before medical marijuana was legal in Colorado, pot smuggling busts have increased 407 percent, according to a report from the Rocky Mountain drug trafficking task force, which is connected to the White House National Office of Drug Control Policy.

Most of the pot was being smuggled primarily to Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas and Wisconsin, the report said.

Marijuana often is sold for twice as much on the black market in states where it is not legal.

‘You have a very desirable product with 48 other states that are potential customers. My God! What a market that is,’ said Gorman.

Any drug cartel activity in Colorado creates huge potential problems for police and citizens, he said.‘(Cartels are) treacherous and they have no sense of morality,’ Gorman said.

Drug-related violence has killed tens of thousands of people in Mexico in the past decade, but Gorman said we won't see that level of violence. Cartels will keep a lower profile in Colorado to avoid drawing attention to their activities.
