Innocent: Andrew Jaipaul, 21, died after being caught up in gang warfare on a London housing estate when he was chased and stabbed 25 times by a mob

An innocent painter and decorator died after he was chased and stabbed 25 times by a large and vicious gang on a housing estate, a court heard today.

Andrew Jaipaul was 'savagely attacked' by a mob as he walked home through the Andover estate in Holloway, north London.

The 21-year-old was repeatedly stabbed near a children's play area before the gang - which allegedly included a 14-year-old boy - ran off.

The Old Bailey was told that the gang was heard shouting 'Busy Block' - a reference to their area of north London - as Mr Jaipaul lay dying on the ground.

Eight defendants - the youth, now 15, and
a 17-year-old, neither of whom can be named, Tirrell Ball-Thomas and 
Orvill Stirling, both 18, Jojo Mafwa and Allan Kalema, both 19, Tommy 
McInerny, 21, and Warren Brooks, 23, all deny murder, conspiracy to 
cause GBH and violent disorder.

The Old Bailey heard today that Mr Jaipaul became innocently caught up in an escalating war between rival north London gangs.

Police had already been alerted by worried callers of a large number of aggressive and threatening youths making their way towards the Estate. CCTV also captured the group making their way to and from the Estate.

Zoe Johnson, prosecuting, told the court: 'On June 26, 2011, at about 10.25pm, Andrew Jaipaul, aged 21, was savagely stabbed to death.

'He was walking home through the Andover Estate when he was attacked. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'He found himself the victim of a series of escalating attacks between rival gangs in north London.

'Andrew Jaipaul was minding his own business when, out of nowhere, a large, armed gang came across him, decided to attack him, chased him down and brutally murdered him near a children’s play area.

'Members of the public saw and heard that group move through the area, pursue Andrew Jaipaul, and kill him. As the members of the group left, they were heard to shout “Busy Block”.

The court also heard today that the gang had also stabbed 
another innocent man just five days earlier.

Accused: Tommy Mcinerney is one of eight defendants on trial for the murder of the 21-year-old painter and decorator on the Andover Estate in Islington

Trial: Eight defendants - including a 15-year-old boy - are on trial at the Old Bailey for the murder of the 21-year-old

Nuruddin
Ahmed was with an old school friend in a north London park when they 
noticed up to 30 youths dressed in black approach them.

His friend ran 
away but Mr Ahem 'didn’t think there was any problem and so he just 
walked off' but was confronted by five youths who hid their faces with 
scarves and balaclavas demanding to know where he was from.

Mr Ahmed 
told them he had nothing to do with gangs and lived on the Andover 
Estate but as turned his back the mob stabbed him 12 times causing a 
lung to collapse. A helicopter ambulance airlifted him to hospital.

In the dock: Jojo Mafwa denies murder following the horrific stabbing in June 2011

Zoe
Johnson, prosecuting, said: 'In the period leading up to the murder 
there was increasing tension between on the one hand the Crouch Hall 
Court gang and the Wray Cray gang and on the other hand the Elthorne 
gang (Busy Block), the Grey Gang, the Cally gang and the Bemerton.'

She
said the 'trigger' for Mr Jaipaul’s murder was the stabbing of Busy
Block gang member Michael Munza in the early hours of June 26, 2011.

He
was chased and then stabbed several times in the buttocks and had a cut
to the head. He was alter that day discharged from hospital accompanied
by Tommy McInerney - another 'prominent member of “Busy Block.'

He
refused to tell police what had happened but Ms Johnson added his 
stabbing was the trigger for the revenge attack on Andrew Jaipaul later
that day.

'Munza, a prominent member of Busy Block, had become a
victim. That could not be left unanswered and Busy Block as a result 
decided to make a show of violence and Andrew Jaipaul was the victim of 
that show of violence.'

The jury heard McInerney appeared with 
others in videos posted on You Tube singing of its exploits and was 
identified as being amongst the group caught on CCTV making its way to 
and from the Andover Estate.

The 'aggressive, territorial and littered
with references to violence' rap videos posted on You Tube 'lauding the
activities of Busy Block'.

The titles included 'Busy Block GB hardest
rapper in the North,' 'Slump Boys,' 'GB Voices in my Head' where red 
bandanas were waved - 'a symbol or calling card of Busy Block.'

The trial continues.
