A special firearms police officer been awarded £20,000 for sexual 
discrimination against the North Yorkshire Police. The officer can only 
be identified as Mrs M for security reasons

An elite police markswoman has won £20,000 compensation after being bullied by colleagues.

She was accused of having an affair with a senior officer and told she could not work with another woman because they would need to go to the toilet together.

Colleagues also hid a stash of hardcore pornography in a cabinet for her to discover during a training exercise.

And at the end of a recruitment day, a training inspector asked the officer, who for legal reasons can only be named as Miss M: 'Would you like me to get you some pink guns?'

An employment tribunal found there was a 'culture of discrimination' in her team at North Yorkshire Police.

It ruled that senior officers failed to investigate her complaints properly and said the claims about the affair were 'salacious and unsubstantiated'.

Miss M, who remains a police officer, said the abuse damaged her career and left her tearful and unable to sleep.

She complained three times in 2010, before making an official complaint in January 2011, when she was kicked out of the firearms unit.

At the tribunal in London, Miss M's lawyer, Damian Kelly, accused the force of a 'cover-up' and said a senior officer had sided with 'the lads', leaving his client isolated.

'It is unfortunate that in the 21st century, discrimination of this kind can still take place in the police force,' Mr Kelly said after the hearing.

The tribunal panel ruled in favour of Miss M on three counts of sex discrimination and handed her the five-figure sum.

Of this, £5,000 was for the 'unsubstantiated' claim about the affair that was repeated during the tribunal. Four other allegations of sex discrimination were not proved.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'In view of the tribunal's earlier findings, the force accepts that the claimant officer was entitled to an award of damages.

'These have been assessed as being in the middle band of the amounts set out in the law for compensation for injury to feelings in cases of this kind.

'We take on board the tribunal's additional award for extra distress caused, in the main, by the officer's original complaints not having been investigated as quickly as they ought to have been.

Miss M completed her training as an authorised firearms officer in 2006. Between 2006 and 2010 she would periodically attend courses run by the North Yorkshire Police firearms training unit

'The force does not intend to appeal against the tribunal's awards.

'Lessons learned from the case have been, and will continue to be, carried into effect. For legal reasons - including the national security rules which apply to aspects of the case - we are not in a position to issue any further statement about the issues in this claim.'

The county's police and crime commissioner, Julia Mulligan, said: 'This was clearly a distressing case for the officer, and it is right she has been awarded damages.

'We must now focus on the lessons we have learned and improve the support for officers who make complaints.

'Speaking generally, I know how difficult it can be for a woman in a male-dominated environment. I want to ensure we have a fair and equal workplace for all.'
