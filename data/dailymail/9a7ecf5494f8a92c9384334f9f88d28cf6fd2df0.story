Alan Ramsay, 12, was swinging from a goalpost during a school PE lesson when it fell on him

A 12-year-old schoolboy suffered a broken neck after he was crushed by a falling goalpost during a school PE lesson.

Alan Ramsay was knocked unconscious and suffered three serious fractures when the goal tipped over as he tried to swing from its two-metre high cross bar at Liberton High School in Edinburgh.  

Classmates watched in horror as he lay unresponsive for three minutes, with bones sticking out of his mouth and neck, before he was rushed to hospital.

His mother Louise Ramsay, 30, who lives close to the school, ran round after she was called and told there had been a 'slight accident'.

She said: 'It's just horrific. It's every parent's worst nightmare. You send your child to school and the next minute you find out that they are hurt.

'I literally ran round the corner to the school. It was traumatic for my son but also for myself.

'I was told in the phone call he'd had a "slight accident" and as a precaution they had rung an ambulance.

'When I saw the ambulance there, he was covered in blood, and I saw he had a head injury so they needed to put the collar on him.

'That's when I found out he had been knocked unconscious. One bone was poking out from under his tongue, one was out under his ear.'

Alan also suffered damage to a blood vessel in his brain, which left him at the risk of a stroke, and has been moved around different hospitals for X-rays, surgery and a neurological scan.

Doctors say he is recovering well but are still working out the best way to treat the 'kink' in the blood vessel, as the issue is not common in children and can increase the risk of a stroke.

Miss Ramsay added: 'My boy had surgery, his neck is broken. I get that he was playing on the crossbar, but I don't know how they managed to fall on top of him. 

'The goals are two metres (6ft 6in) high and he is 1.54 metres (5ft). He jumped up and swung from them. They haven't secured them firmly enough.

'He's going to be in the collar for eight weeks and he's going to be home-schooled. I don't want him to lose his education.

'When the doctor came in and told him he had a break in his neck, he got a big fright.'

The incident happened less than a year after 12-year-old Keane Wallis-Bennett was crushed to death by a free-standing wall as she changed for PE at the school last April.

The wall has since been demolished.

Miss Ramsay said the tragic events in the school last year instantly came to mind when she received the call at around 9.15am last Thursday.

She said: 'I had everything going through my head after that girl last year. Alan's best friend was sick, half of the first years were crying. They were all upset.

'He was just lying there under the goalposts. Especially after what happened last year, they say it's the curse of the PE department. I'm concerned about everything.

'I know my son is old enough to know that he shouldn't be playing on the goals, but surely they should have been secure? Alan is not the only child to swing on them.'

Alan's classmates have rallied around him and have been paying visits to cheer him up. 

A spokesman for the city council said: 'We wish Alan a full recovery and the school are offering every support to him and his family to ensure his education continues while he is off.

'We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and immediate action has been taken to prevent anything similar happening.

'The school has carried out a full risk assessment of all gym activities and other schools and community centres have been instructed to carry out an immediate review of similar equipment.

'The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.' 

Another serious incident happened at the school in 2011 after a girl was seriously injured when she fell 16ft down a lift shaft.  

The incident happened at Liberton High School - the same school where Keane Wallis-Bennett, 12,  was crushed to death by a free-standing wall as she changed for PE last April (pictured, a policeman lays flowers)
