Manchester City are stepping up interest in PSV Eindhoven teenage striker Joel Piroe.

The 15-year-old has been on City's radar for over a year and has also attracted attention from Ajax, AZ Alkmaar and Vitesse Arnhem.

PSV hope to persuade the prolific forward to sign professional forms with them once he turns 16 but that won't be until August and he is still classed as an amateur.

City scouts have watched him regularly in recent months. 

Piroe is not averse to making moves despite his tender years. 

He only moved to PSV from Feyenoord last summer, having scored 45 goals in 26 games for them, and was snapped up by Feyenoord previously from NEC Nijmegen.
