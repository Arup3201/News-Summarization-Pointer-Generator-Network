How much do you hate your daily commute? Probably quite a lot if you live in the UK.

New research from Samsung has looked into how much time Europeans spend travelling to and from work, what annoys us most during our commute, and which nations spend the longest in transit.

The study found that the UK enjoys the fastest commute, with the average person's journey to work taking 36 minutes and 53 seconds, which amounts to six days commuting to and from work a year (or 144 hours).

The study found that 64 per cent of Europeans listen to music during their commute, 15 per cent do nothing and 21 per cent people watch

In fact, nearly one in three  British commuters (28 per cent) have a journey of under 20 minutes, a stark contrast to the European average of just under 45 minutes. It's also much less than  those in Belgium, who clock the longest daily commute at 52 minutes and 48 seconds.

You'd think we'd be happy about that but the survey says that 87 per cent of Brits admit getting frustrated on their way to work, with traffic jams, slow drivers and loud talkers topping the list of annoyances. Other  travel peeves to make the top ten were drivers that weave in and out of lanes in traffic, people listening to loud music, seat hoggers and people who don't give up their seats for the elders.  

Commuting by car came out as the most popular method of travel, with 59 per cent preferring it over trains or buses. Nearly half of Brits walk run or cycle to work and nearly one in three are close enough to walk to their office. Thirty-eight per cent opt for public transport, with the bus beating the train as the most popular way to travel.

Nearly 90 per cent of Brits admit to getting frustrated on their way to work, with traffic jams and slow drivers topping the list of annoyances

To entertain themselves during their commute, UK workers predominantly turn to music (59 per cent), whilst 12 per cent choose to people watch and 16 per cent do nothing at all.

Currently, the smartphone remains the top choice for travel tech with 57 per cent using their handset alone to keep them busy.

Ines van Gennip, Marketing Director of Samsung UK & Ireland, said: 'Despite the UK enjoying the shortest commute in Europe, it's clear the daily journey to work is still a bore for most, with major gripes including delays and overcrowding.'
