Two teenagers are in custody in the shooting of a 15-year-old fellow student who was wounded in the neck during a lunch period outside her North Carolina high school today.

Police suspect 18-year-old Ta'Von McLaurin and a 15-year-old boy, whose name is not being released because of his age, participated in the shooting of Catilyn Abercrombie at  Cape Fear High School in Fayetteville.

Cumberland County Sheriff  Earl 'Moose' Butler said at a news conference the pair were being questioned and would be charged in the incident. 

The weapon, a .22 Daisy rifle, and shell casings, have also been recovered.

Tragic: Local sources identified the victim as 15-year-old Catilyn Abercrombie. Police say she is in a stable condition after surgery

Miss Abercrombie was in stable condition after surgery at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center.

The sheriff said the two were 
apprehended with the help of surveillance video which showed them 
carrying the rifle inside of the school. He said investigators don't 
think Miss Abercrombie was the intended target, but no motive has been 
established.

Tense: Students were escorted out of Cape Fear High School in Fayetteville in single file with their hands up

Emotional: Parents wait outside of Cape Fear High School after the shooting. Students could not be released while the school was locked down

'Why did they shoot? I don't know,' he said.

The high school and nearby Mac Williams Middle School were locked down for hours before students were allowed to go home.

Sheriff's office spokesman Debbie 
Tanna said there would be an increased number of deputies at the high 
school and middle school on Tuesday.

Scene: The teenager was injured at Cape Fear High School in Fayetteville, North Carolina, while students were outside for lunch on Monday afternoon

Reaction: Sheriff Earl Butler said the student was apparently shot with a small-calibre bullet and was taken to a nearby hospital

Asked how long they would be on the 
campuses, Ms Tanna said, 'As long as it takes to make sure the school 
has been put back in order and students and parents feel confident about
their safety.'

A police officer assigned to the high 
school was standing near Miss Abercrombie when she was shot at about 1pm
and immediately called 911, Ms Tanna said.

Students from the middle school were 
sent home before their high school counterparts, who were still 
gradually leaving the campus by 6pm.

Students were searched by police and 
left the building in long lines holding their hands above their heads 
before boarding buses that took them from campus.
