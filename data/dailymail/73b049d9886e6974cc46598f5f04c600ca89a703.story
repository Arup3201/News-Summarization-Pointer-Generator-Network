What is the last thing you remember about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo?

For Messi, it is most likely him tearing Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City apart, making them look like a League One team lost in Europe, nutmegging James Milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside.

For Ronaldo, it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain, sulking back to the halfway line, protesting even though team-mate Gareth Bale had just put Real Madrid 1-0 up against Levante.

Lionel Messi may well be priceless as the Barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career

It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve fast for El Clasico against Messi's Barcelona

It is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet. Yet there is currently no debate to be had. Not even close.

The headlines this week belong to Messi, even if he didn't break a Champions League record on Wednesday and his free-kicks served only to remind us he is human after all.

There was more to his embarrassment of Manchester City than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament. Much more.

If it wasn't his menacing dribbles, it was his six shots against a magnificent Joe Hart. 

If it wasn't his assist for Ivan Rakitic's goal, it was his nutmeg on Milner that reduced Pep Guardiola – the architect of the Barcelona way and current Bayern Munich manager – to nothing more than another supporter in the stands. 

The one-twos, the drops of the shoulder, the shimmies. Pep has seen it all before – at the Nou Camp, at their Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training ground, at almost every stadium he took Barcelona to – yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief. He wasn't alone.

Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantastic' Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport

Should we have expected anything less? Messi has been untouchable this year. So much so it's almost unfair, and part of the credit can even go to – dare we say it? – his nemesis, Ronaldo.

It was on January 12 when the Real Madrid man got the better of the Barca boy for the 2014 Ballon d'Or award, three weeks after Ronaldo returned to his hometown of Funchal on the island of Madeira to unveil a statue of himself.

Before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Ronaldo beat Messi in goals (33 to 25), goals per game (1.18 to 1), minutes per goal (70.94 to 87.24), shots (119 to 96), minutes-per-goal involvement (52.02 to 58.95) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions.

Messi sat there in Zurich, to the left of Ronaldo, and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third Ballon d'Or. Deservedly so, too.

Yet Ronaldo's cry of 'Si' lit something under the four-time winner. Hell hath no fury like a Messi scorned, and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world's best in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Since the Ballon d'Or ceremony, there's been no contest. Messi beats Ronaldo on goals (18 to 8), goals per game (1.2 to 0.73), minutes per goal (75 to 122.75), shots (60 to 52), chances created (39 to 17), assists (9 to 3) and minutes-per-goal involvement (50 to 89.27).

Messi has been outstanding ever since Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or on January 12 and the stats prove it

How the top of La Liga stands ahead of El Clasico

It's unrecognisable. A complete reversal. 

To the overall statistics in all competitions this season, it puts Messi ahead in the three major categories: goals (43 to 41), assists (21 to 15) and, comfortably, chances created (112 to 68).

Down to the brass tacks of La Liga, too. 

There was a moment on November 22, when Ronaldo had 20 goals to Messi's seven. Yet today, Ronaldo has 30 to Messi's 32. All this has reopened the debate between Messi and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in Europe last Tuesday.

Ronaldo must up his game to stay in competition with Messi if he is to retain the Ballon d'Or next year

Ronaldo, for a man that had broken the Champions League goalscoring record, left the pitch shaking his head following a 4-3 defeat by Schalke at the Bernabeu. 

Those all-too-familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team's direction, and the Spanish whistles were piercing.

'I won't talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo announced afterwards, as frustrated as any, while a poll by Spanish newspaper AS found 32.2 per cent voted for Cristiano to be dropped.

All is not right in Ronaldo's world, and he has been putting in additional work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas. Messi, meanwhile, warmed up for El Clasico by putting on a masterclass for Manchester City at the Nou Camp.

Guardiola wasn't the only one mesmerised. Just look at the feedback:

The kid from next door in Barcelona, with the ability to glue the ball to his foot, has been swaying a few votes in his favour, it seems.

Yet on Sunday at 8pm, another chapter of Messi vs Ronaldo – a rivalry that demands its own Wikipedia page – will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million.

Green indicates the player that comes out on top in that category, such as Messi for goals, while those in red shows them as the worst of the six, such as Neymar for assists.
