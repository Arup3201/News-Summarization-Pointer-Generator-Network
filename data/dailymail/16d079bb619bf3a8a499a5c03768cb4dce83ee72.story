The Twelfth Doctor: Landing the role of Doctor Who is a dream come true for Peter Capaldi, who was obsessed with the programme as a youngster

Landing the role of Doctor Who is a dream come true for Peter Capaldi. But it’s more like a nightmare for some of the show’s old production staff.

As a 14-year-old, her badgered them so persistently with fan mail they said they wished the Daleks ‘would exterminate him’.

The Scot, now 55, regularly wrote to the Doctor Who production team asking for photos.

But when Capaldi demanded to be made president of the Official Doctor Who Fan Club in 1972, it seems his enthusiasm started to grate on the show’s staff.

The producer’s secretary, Sarah Newman, informed him the position had already been filled by a rival fan, Keith Miller, 13.

Mr Miller later recalled: ‘He haunted my time running the fan club, as he was quite indignant he wasn’t considered for the post.’

Miss Newman later complained about Capaldi in a letter to the young Mr Miller.

She said: ‘I think Capaldi’s the end and I wish the Daleks or someone would exterminate him.’

As a youth, the Scottish actor fired off regular missives to the Doctor Who production team asking for set photos. He also penned lengthy letters to the Radio Times and the Doctor Who International Fan Club magazine, praising his favourite episodes and marvelling at the special effects.

In one letter written when he was 17, he even analysed the show’s opening credits, commending their ‘artistic integrity’.

Mr Miller, Capaldi's arch-rival in the fan stakes, later recalled how Capaldi was annoyed he had lost out on the position and began pestering the BBC with constant messages.

Writing in his book, The Official Doctor Who Fan Club Volume One, Mr Miller said: ‘He haunted my time running the fan club, as he was quite indignant he wasn’t considered for the post.’

He added in an interview with Starburst magazine: ‘I was given the fan club to take the strain of dealing with the advent of the super-fans like Peter Capaldi who wanted a running dialogue with the production team, away from Sarah.’

Lifelong fan: A 15-year-old Peter wrote to this letter to the Radio Times about Doctor Who. He also wrote a string of letters to the series' production staff, who soon grew tired of his constant badgering

In August 1972, Miss Newman complained about Capaldi in a letter to Mr Miller. She said: ‘You’re not by any means worse than Peter C... I think he’s the end and I wish the Daleks or someone would exterminate him or something to that effect.’

Mr Miller recalled the harassed BBC secretary even jokingly asked him to ‘sort him out’.

He said: ‘During the next phone call to Sarah, I asked how things were going with Peter Capaldi. "Oh god, I wish someone would sort him out." Then she paused. "Actually, he lives in Scotland too - could you pop over to Glasgow and sort him out for me?"'

Capaldi, who is best known for playing foulmouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in political satire The Thick of It, will join Doctor Who as the 12th incarnation of the Time Lord at the end of the Christmas Special.

Odds-on favourite: Capaldi takes over from Matt Smith, right, who will play his last scenes as Doctor Who in this years Christmas Special, with the former Thick Of It star appearing in the Tardis for the first time next year

The actor, who has in the past admitted writing letters begging for production secrets, was the odds-on favourite to land the role in the weeks leading up to Sunday’s announcement.

But he has faced criticism in the days since, with some viewers complaining that he is too old to play the Doctor.

For the announcement, which was aired live on BBC1, Capaldi joined Zoe Ball to reveal himself to the audience and cameras.

He described his relief at being able to relieve himself of the secret and told how he had loved Doctor Who since the age of nine.

He said: ‘It’s so wonderful not to keep this secret any longer. For a while I couldn’t tell my daughter who kept on looking on the internet and kept seeing people saying so and so should be the Doctor and she got rather upset.’

He added: ‘[The audition] was quite hard because even though I’m a lifelong Doctor Who fan, I haven’t played Doctor Who since I was nine in the playground. I downloaded old scripts from the internet and read those.’
