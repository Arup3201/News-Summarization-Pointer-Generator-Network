Domino's has launched a deep-dish pizza which contains more than double the number of calories found in its regular pies.

The 12" pepperoni pan pizza, which features a thick base, slathered with butter, two layers of cheese and toppings, boasts 2,420 calories and 130 grams of fat.

It makes for a dramatic contrast with the nutritional value of its regular thin-crust version, at 910 calories and 47 grams of fat.

The new pie also contains 43 grams more fat than a 40-piece bucket of chicken on sale at the chain and 138 more carbohydrates than an eight-piece bread basket.

As far as rival chains are concerned the Domino's pan pizza, which will initially retail for $7.99, also proves to be a fattier option.

Domino's Pan Pizza contains more calories than traditional offerings. Here we see how it's calorie and fat content compares:

It contains 500 more calories than the Original Pan 
Pizza's 12" equivalent (1,920 cals) and 420 more calories than Pizza Hut's pepperoni thick base offering (2,000 cals).

Papa John's pepperoni pie has one of the lowest calorie counts at 1,840 per 12" round and 230 per 1/8 slice.

According to Todd Wilbur, the author of Top 
Secret Recipes, who has been cloning fast food favourites at home for 
decades, the pan pizza is made by pressing dough into a well-oiled or 
buttered pan, which is more similar to a cake pan than a typical pizza 
pan.

The pan is then covered and baked for up to 60 minutes before being topped and sprayed with a butter-flavoured product which helps achieve a golden crust.

It is the third time Domino's has 
attempted to break the $6.4 billion deep pan pizza market dominated by 
Pizza Hut.

In 1986, the butter-baked creation was introduced by chain  but many stores decided not to promote it because they took too long to prepare - the baking process can take up to two hours.

And in 1997 when the pan pizza was introduced for a second time poor sales prompted decision-makers to scrap it from the menu.

More
than 5,000 Domino's stores across the U.S. will be serving up pan 
pizzas as of today and an accompanying television ad campaign will 
launch on October 1.

On of the key features of Domino's pan 
pizza is that the dough used to make the bases will be fresh, while many pizza chains still use frozen premixes.

Commenting on the launch Patrick Doyle, CEO at Domino's told QSR magazine: 'There is a standard out there for pan pizza that we realized could be better.

'The reason most people buy a pan pizza is for the crust, and that key component should be fresh, never frozen.

'But what we think ultimately doesn't matter; I'd encourage customers to taste for themselves.'
