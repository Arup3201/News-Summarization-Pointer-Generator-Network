A father has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting a man he found hiding in his daughter's bedroom in the head.

Charles Jordan, 41, killed Marc Carrion, 32, in September believing that Mr Carrion had broken into his daughter's room at their apartment in Philadelphia. 

In fact his daughter, Brenda Jordan, 20, had been dating Mr Carrion for a month, and told police she invited him up to her room. 

Charles Jordan, 41, has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting Marc Carrion, 32, in the head in September after mistaking him for an intruder

Jordan found Mr Carrion in his daughter Brenda's room, and believed he had broken in. However, Brenda has since told police the pair were dating for a month and she invited him up 

When Jordan walked into his daughter's room, he saw there was something wrong with the window, before noticing Mr Carrion crouching in a corner.

In a recording of a 911 call made at the time, Jordan can be heard telling Mr Carrion not to move before a single shot is fired.

Jordan claims that he opened fire after Mr Carrion lunged at him. Mr Carrion was taken to hospital, but later died of his injuries.  

Neighbours reported hearing a woman shouting 'no, daddy, no' at the time of the shooting. 

The case against Jordan says he killed Mr Carrion 'while acting under a sudden and intense passion, resulting from serious provocation by the deceased'.  

Crime scene: The shooting took place inside the Jordans' apartment at the Holme Circle housing complex  

Jordan, a hotel worker with no priors, was arraigned on Monday and released after posting $15,000 bail. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for November 11.

Jordan's attorney, Todd Henry, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Jordan 'regrets what happened' but 'maintains his innocence.'

Mr Henry added: 'He realizes what happened that night was a tragedy, but the actions only happened because he felt threatened in his home, and he feared for his personal safety and his daughter's personal safety.'   

At the time of the shooting, Marc Carrion's mother, Gloria Moyett, told the Philadelphia Daily News that Charles Jordan’s story about an intruder did not make sense to her.

Romance: Jordan and Carrion had met only recently, and on the night of the killing a neighbor overheard the 20-year-old tell her father that the victim was her 'best friend'

‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’ she said.

Moyett said her 32-year-old son a troubled past, including a drug arrest in 2008, but he had been working hard to rebuild his life. 

Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.
