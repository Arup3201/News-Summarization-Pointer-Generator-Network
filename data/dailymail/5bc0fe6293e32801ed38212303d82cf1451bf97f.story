If, like me, you thought your Barbie days ended about the same time you stopped wearing pigtails and carrying your packed lunch in a glittery pink lunchbox, then think again.

Turns out Barbie is this season's new style icon, and everyone from Rita Ora to Lily Allen and Katy Perry is channeling the plastic princess' look.

Barbie's style renaissance is all thanks to super-hip fashion designer Jeremy Scott, who designs for the Italian label Moschino.

Scott dedicated the brand's entire spring/summer 2015 collection to the pint-sized blonde bombshell.  

He filled the catwalk with figure-hugging looks in bubble-gum pink, created colourful 'dolly' accessories and even reworked the Moschino logo in that familiar Barbie typeface.

I couldn't resist joining in the fun, so this week I've created a sugar-sweet Barbie-inspired beauty look, with bold, baby-pink lips, and tons of sparkle and shimmer – just perfect for a fancy-dress party or a glam girly night out.

BINKY'S BARBIE BEAUTY

Step 1: Eyes

Once you've applied your preferred base, get straight onto the eyes. Begin by blending a soft nude shadow across your lids across my lids, to act as a base. 

I used Clarins Ombré Matte Eyeshadow in Nude Beige – the cream-to-powder formula of this eyeshadow means it's smooth to apply but is also incredibly long-lasting.

Next, add a dusting of sparkle using Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Blue Angel.

 

  

Binky has opted for high shine and heavy bronzer to give her cheeks a sculpted look

Glitters can be tricky and messy to work with, so to make things easier dab a small amount onto the back of your hand, then, using a fine eyeshadow brush, carefully dab the pigment over your eyelids to create glitzy sheen. 

Apply a hint of glitter under the lower lash line too, for super-sparkly Barbie lashes.

To give your eyes extra definition, line your upper and lower lash lines with Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. 

Finally, apply a few coats of Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara – perfect for those long, voluminous lashes that living dolls should have!

Step 2: Cheeks

Barbie is famous for her gorgeous cheekbones, so add a touch of contour with bareMinerals Ready Bronzer in The Skinny Dip, dusted under the apples of your cheeks and across your temples.

Next up, for gorgeous shimmery cheekbones, you need to pack on the highlighter. 

Binky says that this look is great for both fancy dress or if you just fancy looking extra girly

I used Too Faced Candlelight Glow Highlighter, swirling the two shades in the compact together and blending the powder across the tops of my cheekbones for a gorgeously girly shimmer. 

Finally, for a really sparkly finish, dust a hint of the Too Faced glitter pigment over your cheekbones.

Step 3: Lips

Key to this look is the bright baby-pink lip, as seen on the Moschino catwalk. Try Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Candy Rose – it is a strongly pigmented pastel pink shade which means the colour really lasts. 

Finally, to make your pout really pop, add a slick of bareMinerals Marvellous Moxie Lipgloss in the sugar-sweet baby-pink shade Miss Popular.

Binky says that a bright lip with a strong pink pigment is essential for achieving the Barbie vibe

You can get all the products I used to create my Moschino-inspired look online at Escentual.com. Life in plastic, it's fantastic!

On another fashion-related note, I've booked my ticket to Clothes Show Live at the Birmingham NEC in December. 

I'm really looking forward to getting a sneak peek into the new season's top trends and of course indulging in a bit of retail therapy!

Stay beautiful,

Love Binky xxx
