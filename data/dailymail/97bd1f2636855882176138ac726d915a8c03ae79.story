When it comes to World Cup pedigree, four- time winners Italy must make Roy Hodgson’s England green with envy.

But there were plenty of questions to ponder for coach Cesare Prandelli as Italy’s World Cup boot camp got under way at their fabulous training complex in Coverciano, just outside Florence.

Prandelli’s men are unique among the 32 nations heading for Brazil in not having a single player among their provisional squad who is based in England.

Star men: Mario Balotelli and Andrea Pirlo go through their paces at the training session

Hodgson has named his World Cup 23 and
 probably knows his XI for England’s first game in Brazil against Italy 
on June 14 in Manaus. No such luck for Prandelli, who has the 
job of improving on Italy’s last tournament when they reached the final 
of Euro 2012.

There were 31 
players doing laps of the track and fitness tests in 80 degree heat on Tuesday. As he addressed the media for the first time, the manager 
didn’t seem to have much idea who was going to make the cut from his 
provisional squad named last week.

The
 problems are particularly acute up front where all the  contenders have
 different issues. Antonio Cassano is unpredictable, ex-Manchester 
United striker Giuseppe Rossi is coming off a long-term injury, Serie 
A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile is raw and Mario Balotelli is like 
Cassano, but even more so.

‘I
 will take my time to name my 23 right up until the deadline of June 2 
if I have to,’ said Prandelli. ‘This is what the camp is for, to assess 
fitness and strength. Strength is important.’

And woe betide any mavericks — Balotelli and Cassano come to mind — who step out of line.

‘When
 a player puts his ego ahead of everybody, then it becomes a problem. 
And it’s the same for me,’ said Prandelli. ‘We are working with the aim 
of reaching the final. Each player must be flexible to do different 
things for the team.’

Power: Balotelli, who arrived late for the training session, bursts out of the blocks in a sprint

Confident: Prandelli has picked friendlies against 'whipping boys' as Italy look to start a winning streak

Italy’s choice of warm-up games gives away how crucial they regard the opening fixture.

Whereas
 Hodgson has opted to play friendlies against Peru, Ecuador and Honduras
 with half an eye on the other two games in the group — against Uruguay 
and Costa Rica — for Prandelli it is about England.

Italy
 play the Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage on May 31 and then 
Luxembourg, whipping boys Prandelli will use to boost confidence.

Italy
 outplayed England in the Euro 2012 quarter-final even though they only 
advanced on penalties, but Prandelli expects a tougher task this time.

‘England
 are younger, they are quicker and they have pace on the wings,’ he 
noted. ‘And the English mentality is always good. In Manaus, when 
conditions might be difficult, they won’t give in.

‘The
 first game is normally key. If you get three points immediately, you 
are up and running. Spain lost the first game at 2010 so there  are 
exceptions, but we can’t think that way.’

Hard work: Balotelli sweats in the heat during the training session on Tuesday

Couldn't be better: Gianluigi Buffon winks at a nearby camera as Italy began their World Cup preparations

Calm: Italy will be looking to Andrea Pirlo to help them keep possession in the Brazilian heat

Just
 as Balotelli dominated attention during his time at Manchester City, so
 there were more questions asked about him than anyone else at 
Prandelli’s conference.

Nobody
 is daring to suggest he will be left out the squad — his heroics at 
Euro 2012 mean he is regarded as a wild card worth having. But 
Balotelli, who has just had a disappointing season with AC Milan, didn’t
 exactly bust a gut in training alongside the veteran Andrea Pirlo, 
sauntering out an hour behind some of his colleagues clutching a bottle 
of water.

Prandelli said afterwards: ‘It was like the first day of school, a lot of emotion.’

He
 promises to have the squad doing hard, double sessions before they 
travel to play the Irish. Italy have no English-based player in the 
squad but four — Balotelli (Manchester City), Rossi (Manchester United),
 Gabriel Paletta and Alberto Aquilani (both  Liverpool) — have 
previously been at big North West clubs.

Tough: Antonio Cassano feels the burn during a sprint with coaches watching on

Determined to get there: Prandelli is not writing off Giuseppe Rossi, despite his lack of match fitness

Rossi, 27, has only played four times since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for four months.

Prandelli
 is not writing him off, however, saying: ‘Rossi is very talented and 
has shown the  spirit of a champion to come back in time.’

Italy have already had to change their media plans for today.

Goalkeper
 Gigi Buffon, one of four survivors from the Italy squad who won the 
World Cup in 2006, would normally have spoken as team captain but he 
will probably swerve it this time after announcing that he is 
separating from his Czech wife Alena.

A sympathetic Prandelli remarked: ‘I’m sorry because it’s upsetting for everyone when there is a separation.’

The coach’s football problems lie at the other end of the pitch and centre on who to select.
