The husband of one of the founders of Facebook has launched his latest bid to run for Congress after buying a home in a competitive district in upstate New York.

Chris Hughes was Mark Zuckerberg's college roommates when he launched the social network and now Hughes' husband Sean Eldridge is using his new-found connections to upstate New York to try to win a spot in Congress.

Speculation has surrounded Eldridge since he and Hughes helped lead the charge for marriage equality in New York, but the campaign became official Sunday night when a Twitter ad announced his bid during the Emmys.

Heading into the campaign: Sean Eldridge (right), who is married to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (left), announced on Sunday night that he is running for Congress in New York's 19th District

Eldridge, 27, is running in New York's 19th district which is the second place where he and his millionaire husband moved while actively pursuing a political career.

Critiques of his carpet-bagger approach first came when he and Hughes bought a $5million estate in Garrison, New York, only to spend more time in a different district once it became clear that he would have a tough time winning the Democratic nomination in that area.

In 2010, Republicans Nan Hayworth and Chris Gibson were elected to the 18th and 19th Districts respectively. After just one term, Hayworth was ousted by Sean Patrick Maloney, a gay Democrat who parallels Eldridge in his political beliefs making the prospect of fighting against one another less appealing.

The New York Times profiled the power couple in July and described how they first bought an 80-acre estate in Garrison- which was in the 18th District and only an hour's drive to their loft in SoHo- and then later bought a property an hour further away in Shokan- in the 19th District.

The couple still own all three properties- the $5million estate in Garrison, the $4,9million loft in SoHo and the $2million home in Shokan.

In his campaign video, Eldridge touts 
the work that he has done with local industries through Hudson River 
Ventures which he founded to help fund small businesses.

He explains that he was born in Ohio but makes no mention about the various moves throughout the state.

'I love the Hudson Valley, it's where I'm building my home, my family, and my business,' he said in the video.

He
 also says that part of his motivation for the campaign is that he wants
 to 'reduce the interest in money and special interests in politics' but
 pointedly omits any mention of his husband.

Hughes has an estimated worth of $500million and now runs The New Republic magazine after having bought it last year. The price Hughes paid for the majority stake in the storied media company was not publicly disclosed.

The couple have been known to open their purse strings when it comes to things they care about, including their lavish wedding last July. They had the formal ceremony at the home in Garrison, but then held a much bigger reception at Cipriani restaurant in Manhattan.

While the Garrison ceremony only included 75 of their closest friends and family members, the Cipriani reception was extended to include 400 of their nearest and dearest including both Senators from New York and media moguls like Arianna Huffington and Hughes' old pal Zuckerberg.

Though Eldridge's personal knowledge of the 19th District may be something he is building, he and Hughes have been working within the realms of New York state politics for years at this point.

Sleek: Their latest property- a $2million two-bedroom in Shokan- means that they are residents of New York's 19th District and on Sunday Eldridge announced his candidacy in the Congressional race for that area

He has worked for a same-sex marriage group called Freedom to Marry since 2011 and the couple have raised thousands of dollars for Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Now Eldridge is officially trying to unseat Chris Gibson, the Republican congressman who has represented the 19th district since 2010 after being elected during a wave of Tea Party popularity.

'One thing is clear, this race will test the hypothesis of whether Congressional seats can be bought,' Gibson's spokeswoman Stephanie Valle told Politico in a statement.

'This comes as no surprise. He purchased a multimillion dollar home in our district in January, filed to run for Congress in February, and then cleared up his voter registration problems a few months later.Â  He's been raising money from wealthy friends while at the same time touting an economic plan that boils down to loaning his potential constituents money.'
