Thousands of home-owners blighted by the high-speed HS2 rail link are set to claim compensation for ‘exceptional hardship’ after a Government quango was today forced to disclose secret information it tried to keep hidden.

In a landmark victory for blighted residents, an appeal judge has ordered the HS2 company - set up by ministers to run the controversial £33billion high speed line – to make public details about how far from the track it is allowing ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation claims.

The tribunal judge also told bosses at Whitehall firm HS2 Ltd that it was time to ‘treat the public like grown ups’ and credit them with having enough intelligence not to ‘misunderstand’ the requested data.

The judgement came after HS2 Ltd had argued – unsuccessfully - that it needed to keep secret the details because ‘disclosure would lead to a significant rise in the number of applications.’

But the tribunal said people were sensible enough not to misunderstand the significance of ‘a bald distance number’ and that disclosure was ‘in the public interest.’

The judge overturned an earlier decision by the privacy watchdog Information Commissioner which had backed HS2 Ltd’s attempt to keep the details secret.

The ruling is now set to open the floodgates to many more ‘exceptional hardship’ applications from people living much further away from the 351-mile track linking London to Birmingham and beyond to Manchester and Leeds. Some have been told by banks that their properties are now worth ‘zero’ because of the blight caused by proximity to the high speed railway.

It is a humiliating blow for the firm and was hailed by protesters as a major victory.

Campaign groups say the ruling is significant because it gives home-owners an insight into the distance criteria being used secretly by the Government quango when considering ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation claims from people forced to sell because of emergency reasons such as poor health or divorce.

An appeal judge has ordered the HS2 company to make publicise details about how far from the track it is allowing compensation claims

Yet despite the judge’s ruling, taxpayer-funded HS2 Limited are still refusing to disclose the farthest distance from the high speed line it had granted exceptional hardship compensation – taking advantage of the 35-day window to decide whether to comply with the disclosure ruling, or to appeal further.

Protest groups said the ‘batting average’ for successful claims so far is ‘around 300m’ from the line  but they suspected some so-far undisclosed claims might stretch to up to 0.62 miles – a kilometre – away.

The battle for disclosure began when retired homeowner Iain Helstrip from Finmere,  Buckinghamshire applied for ‘exceptional hardship’ compensation for himself and his wife after being unable to sell their rural home.

HS2 Limited rejected their claim saying they failed to meet two key criteria, saying that the evidence submitted did not convince them ‘that there was an urgent need to sell now’ and ‘because of the distance of the property from the proposed high speed line.’

Mr Helstrip then asked HS2 how far away from the track the farthest successful claim had been.

But HS2 Ltd refused to reveal this citing exemption under the Freedom of Information Act stating it would ‘prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.’

Mr Helstrip then appealed to the Information Commissioner which backed HS2 Ltd’s stance saying that disclosure was ‘likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs and that the public interest favours withholding of the requested information.’ HS2 was therefore ‘not obliged to disclose the information.’

But the appeal tribunal headed by Judge Chris Ryan overturned that decision and backed the residents.

The tribunal’s official judgment said: ‘We conclude, unanimously, that HS2 was not justified in refusing the Appellant’s request for information and that it should be disclosed to him.’

It added: ’We have decided that HS2 was not entitled to withhold information about the distance between the route of the proposed line and the property which was furthest away from it, but had nevertheless qualified for assistance under EHS (Exceptional Hardship Scheme).’

And the judge’s ruling adds witheringly: ‘We think that HS2’s expressed fear about the public’s inability to understand the disclosed information does not give the public enough credit for its ability to delve behind over-simplified media headlines or slanted statements from pressure groups.’

The panel said: ‘It does not require information to be withheld from the public as though, in the words of the Appellant’, the public was not sufficiently grown up to be trusted with it.’

The ruling noted that HS2 Ltd did not challenge evidence from Mr Helstrip that local estate agents considered that ‘prices had been significantly reduced across an area extending up to three miles either side of the proposed route.’

HS2 Ltd’s location criterion imposed ‘an unnecessarily strict limitation on qualifying properties.’

The Exceptional Hardship Scheme is discretionary and  open to those  whose properties are ‘significantly adversely affected’ and who live in ‘close proximity’ to it and can prove they are unable to sell because of HS2, and had ‘no prior knowledge’ of the route, as well being able to ‘demonstrate hardship’ defined by strict criteria such as serious medical reasons or divorce.

These claims, if successful,  are fast-tracked and paid out much quicker than the normal compulsory purchase claims.

It has particular significance for stricken residents like  97-year-old widow Elfrida Harper-Tarr who has been left penniless because of plans for the high-speed rail line through her Buckinghamshire village village of Turweston.

The former postmistress had to move into
a nursing home last year and needs to sell her four-bedroom cottage to 
pay the care bill. But a local couple who made an offer on the property,
with an asking price of £275,000, were refused a mortgage on it because
the new line is scheduled to pass 500 yards away and said it had a 
value of ‘zero.’ Now Mrs Harper-Tarr, who ran a post office from the 
property until she was 90 and received an MBE in 1998 for her services 
to Scouting in the village, fears she will be unable to afford her 
£3,500-a-month care bills.

Unsellable: Elfrida Harper-Tarr's former post office in the village of Turweston in Buckinghamshire. The value of the property is 'zero pounds' because of the disruption HS2 will cause

HS2 Ltd insists there is no geographical limit for people claiming compensation under the ‘exceptional hardship’ scheme. But protesters at the ‘HS2 Action Alliance’ say HS2 must ‘come clean’.

Experts believe up to 350,000 properties have been blighted by the controversial line which will not be completed until 2032, leaving the Government with a total compensation bill of around £2.5billion. HS2 disputes this but is unable or unwilling to provide figures.

Hilary Wharf of the HS2 Action Alliance said: ‘This is a great victory for common sense and shines a bright light on Whitehall secrecy over this scheme. Claims made under the ‘exceptional hardship’ rules are extremely difficult because there are so many difficult hoops to jump through. This should inspire more people to claim.’

Mrs Wharf from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, said that original phase 1 ‘exceptional hardship scheme’ had so far  completed just  65  successful claims at a cost of under £20million,  though 83 have been accepted to date. Most are rejected.

The ruling comes just days after the Government   launched a consultation on the ‘exceptional hardship rules’ for the second phase of the line from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester.

The judge’s report notes  how Helen German, manager of the EHS scheme argued in her witness statement that:  ‘Disclosure would lead to a significant increase in the number of applications, many of them unmeritorious, because they would arise out a misunderstanding of the relevance of the bald distance figure. This would delay the  process for other applicants.’

Contacted by Mailonline, an HS2 Ltd spokesman said: ‘We note the outcome of the Tribunal’s decision and we will now consider how best to respond.

‘HS2 Ltd’s original decision to withhold the information was intended to uphold the public interest and was supported by the Information Commissioner. The Tribunal agreed that this was a reasonable position for HS2 Ltd to take, but held, on balance,  that it was in the public interest to  disclose the information.’
