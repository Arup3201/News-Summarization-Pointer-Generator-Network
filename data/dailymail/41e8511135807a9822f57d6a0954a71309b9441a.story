Garden thieves  have forced managers at Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens to install plant-cages and CCTV cameras in an attempt to protect the world's rarest plants.

While most of the 3.5 million people who visit Sydney's  iconic inner-city gardens are primarily interested in the array of exotic flora and it's panoramic harbour views, an alarming amount of green thumbs are knocking off plants.

Now, workers at the Royal Botanic Gardens fear the extinction of some rare species, as thieves are walking out with plants hidden in their backpacks or sports bags.

Dr Brett Summerell, deputy executive director at the Royal Botanic Gardens explained to Daily Mail Australia his concern if plant robberies continue to occur.

'It is quite problematic,' he said. 

'I don't think people understand that in the Botanic Gardens there are plants collected for scientific purposes, which tell us a lot of detail about the species and where they are from. 

'It is very difficult to recollect some of these plant species and it is becoming more and more difficult to display them, especially if we are losing them - we won't want to put the important ones out.'  

In an attempt to conserve the existing plants, extra security has been set up throughout the garden to monitor  any unusual activity among the visitors.

'It is just one of those things where we have to put cages around the smaller ones until they are big enough - which make it harder for people to steal them,' Dr Summerell said.

Each year, the Royal Botanic Gardens lose around five exotic plants from theft, leaving them at a loss of thousands of dollars. 

'The plants have a significant value - approximately several hundreds to a thousands dollars - some of them aren't even on the market.

'But it isn't the commercial value that is important, it is the cost of travelling to a region that is difficult to get to - it could cost thousands to actually get the plant.

'When you think of travelling to Cambodia for a specific species, well that isn't cheap.' 

High on the list for thieves are cacti, orchards, cycas and general palms which are easy to pull out

Dr Summerell said usually garden staff tend to be understanding when confronting robbers.

'One of the horticulturists saw someone pulling out some plants - we had to have hard words with them and it turned out they just wanted to bring a bit of the plant home - they didn’t think it would impact the plant,' he said.

'In cases where people are stealing whole plants with criminal intent they are typically handed over to police'.

Dr Summerell described the plant thieves as garden enthusiasts who are looking to compliment their homes with exotic plants.  

'A lot of them are keen to have it in their garden collection but in other cases, which are more concerning, it is because the plants are rare and endangered and almost impossible to get get.' 

Although it is 'difficult to sell plants on the black market', Dr Summerell believes a few of the stolen plants are sold illegally. 

Dr Summerell said the phenomenon of stealing plants have been going on for years, however, thanks to technology it is now easier to monitor. 

'This has been an ongoing problem... it is something you have to be concerned about and take into account whenever you are planting.'  

Sydney's  Royal Botanical Gardens urge anyone who witness visitors stealing plants to report it to staff.
