Police say they have discovered the remains of as many as four dead infants in a storage locker in the central Canadian city of Winnipeg.

Winnipeg Const. Eric Hofley said Tuesday concerned employees at the storage locker company called police Monday and, once inside, police found what appeared to be the remains of up to four infants. 

He says the remains were so decomposed, it's not clear if police are dealing with three or four bodies.

Scene: Police made the gruesome discovery at this U-Haul storage facility in Winnipeg late Monday night. The bodies of several dead babies were found

He says victims appear to be 'very, very young' and most likely newborns.

Autopsies were being conducted.

He says police are talking to a few people, but the remains don't appear to be linked to any infants that have been reported missing.

The incident occurred at the U-Haul storage facility in the Winnipeg suburb of West Alexander.

Hofley told reporters on Tuesday that in his 14 years as an officer he has never experienced anything like this, describing the scene as 'very disturbing', according to CBC News.

The station were also reporting that the female owner of the locker was being interviewed. 

Investigation: The U-Haul storage locker facility, which was cordoned off by police tape, was cleared Tuesday

There are no suspects in custody. 

'It’s just too early in the investigation to say exactly what has transpired here,' Hofley said.

Homicide investigators have been contacted.

However the case remains in the hands of child-abuse specialists.

Police said they will have an update on the case Wednesday.
