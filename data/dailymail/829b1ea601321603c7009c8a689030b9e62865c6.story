A  woman allegedly dug up her father's grave in search of his 'real will' in a move she insists he would have been 'okay' with.

Melanie Nash, 52, is accused of conspiring with three others to remove her father Eddie's remains from Colebrook Village Cemetery in New Hampshire in May.

The vault of the businessman, who died of a heart attack aged 68 in 2004, was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked. His body was left intact.

In a  police statement, Nash wrote she had met up with Ginette Dowse, 71, Michael Day, 37, and David Grey, 57, to dig up her father, whom she believed had been buried with 'the real will'.

'All this was done for the right reasons and I know my father would be OK with it...,' she said in the statement obtained by The Caledonian Record.

'What we all did was to dig up my father's coffin, Eddie Nash, looking for documents. We did it with respect.'

However, after ransacking her father's remains, Nash found only a packet of cigarettes in his hand, a police affidavit said.

'You hear of grave robbing 100, 150 years ago,' Jenkins and Newman Funeral Home Director Michael Pearson told the station WMUR earlier this year. 'You don't think of it in 2014.'

According to prosecutors, Nash told police she did not receive anything when her father died and had been thinking of digging up the grave for years to prove her sister, Susie Nash, 'hid the will'.

Ransacked: The vault of Mr Nash  was found cracked with the casket opened and his remains ransacked

However, Susie Nash  said there was only one will when her father's estate plan was done in 1995 and everyone involved knew about it.

Last month, Nash's lawyer, William Albrecht, filed a motion saying the suspect's police statement should be excluded from the case because it violates her right against self-incrimination.

But Coos County Attorney John McCormick said Nash showed her 'free will' in coming to police and waiving her Miranda rights.  

Mr Nash, a one-time dairy farmer, started a successful heavy equipment business in 1979, still run by his family.

The Colebrook-based company, which employs 30 workers, sells second-hand backhoes, skidders and dozers all over the U.S. and Canada .

According to his obituary, Mr Nash and his wife, Shirley, had two daughters, two sons and eights grandchildren. He has since been reburied at a cost of several thousand dollars.

Nash has been charged with criminal mischief, interference with a cemetery or burial ground, conspiracy to commit the crime of interference with a cemetery, and abuse of a corpse, according to The Berlin Daily Sun.  

Day, Dowse and Grey have also been indicted in the case.
