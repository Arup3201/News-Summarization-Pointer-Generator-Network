Chantelle McMillan has been jailed for 11 years after she attacked a couple with her sister and two friends, which led to a man being injured after he was pushed through a shop window in Looe

Two sisters have been jailed for 21 years for a vicious gang attack on a man celebrating his 40th birthday with his wife.

Jamie Skinner was thrown into a shop window and then punched, kicked and stamped on in the street while his wife was hit with the heel of a stiletto in the attack by Chantelle McMillan and her sister Valena, a mother of three, along with their friend Brett Lourens.

Mr Skinner suffered a fractured eye socket after being set upon by the group in Looe in Cornwall.

The sisters along with 22-year-old Lourens were convicted at Truro Crown Court of causing Mr Skinner grievous bodily harm with intent. 

A jury also found them guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent to his wife Catherine.

They were jailed for 31 years between them for the unprovoked attack.  

Another friend of the sisters Jack Brooks, 23, was convicted of intending to do grievous bodily harm to the 40-year-old and was jailed for eight years. He had previously admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Skinner.

The court heard Mr and Mrs Skinner had been in the Ship Inn celebrating his birthday on July 12 last year. 

They had been drinking and dancing in the pub before they left and encountered the group in the street.

Valena McMillan, 30, of Duloe, Cornwall, confronted Mr Skinner, swore at him, grabbed his T-shirt and punched him in the face.

Her 24-year-old sister, who has a history of violence, and Lourens then joined in and 'threw repeated punches to Mr Skinner's head and body.' 

Prosecutor Phillip Lee said: 'He was pushed into the window of a nearby shop so it smashed. He was kicked and stamped on by Valena McMillan, Chantelle McMillan and Brett Lourens.'

As he tried to get up, Brooks punched, kicked and stamped on Mr Skinner with another mystery male.

And three of them also assaulted Mrs Skinner leaving her with cuts to her head.

Chantelle McMillan, the younger of the two sisters then used the point of a stiletto heel to hit Mrs Skinner on the head while 'moaning and roaring' like an animal.

The couple, of Plymouth, were taken to Derriford Hospital where Mr Skinner required surgery for a fractured eye socket. 

He also suffered bruising to his eyes and tenderness to his wrist after being pushed through the shop window in Buller Street in Looe, near the Ship Inn.

During the trial the court heard Mr Skinner had done a mooney in the street before the attack took place. 

Shortly before he had been set upon the jury was told Mr Skinner saw a girl sitting on the pavement outside and asked her if she was alright. 

He said she had told him he had been hit in the face and Mr Skinner advised her to call an ambulance, before he left because she was with other people.

Valena McMillan, a mother of three, launched at Mr Skinner and punched him in the face as the attack started

Valena McMillan was sentenced to nine years for the attack on Mr Skinner and one year for assaulting Mrs Skinner.

Lourens, 22, of Duloe, received the same sentences, both to run consecutively to a total of 10 years.

Chantelle McMillan, who was the subject of a suspended sentence for another violent offence at the time of the attacks on July 12, 2013, was sentenced to nine years in respect of the assault on Mr Skinner and two years for attacking his wife.
