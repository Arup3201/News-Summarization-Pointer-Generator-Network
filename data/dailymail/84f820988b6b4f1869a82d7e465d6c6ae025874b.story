A man who was released from jail after almost 40 years when a judge ruled he did not receive a fair trial has spent his first days of freedom enjoying how much technology, food and bedding has changed since 1975.

David Bryant, now 56, was dramatically sprung on Thursday after a Bronx judge ruled that his defense during hearings into the brutal rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl had been flawed.

The man, who was just 18 when he was imprisoned, looked at an iPad and iPhone with amazement, according to the New York Post.

Free man: David Bryant, 56, from Bronx, has been released from prison after serving 39 years for the murder of an 8-year-old girl he says he did not commit

'Wow, this is all new!' Bryant said as he used the tablet.

When he picked up a smart phone bought for him by the advocacy group that helped get him released, he remembered that in 1975 everyone dialed with a rotary phone.

'The last time I was out, it was ‘tick, tick, tick,'' Bryant said as he motioned with his hand.

Food was also a surprise to the newly-released man. 'I couldn’t believe how much the size of the food has changed. Everything is so huge. Who can eat all that?' he said.

'I feel like I walked out of a time machine. Everything is totally different,' he told the New York Daily News.

Bryant told the Post: 'Last night they took me to dinner at a nice restaurant, and the appetizers were more than we would eat for a week.'

He spent the night of his release at the home of Centurion Ministries director Kate Germond. 'In there (prison) the bed was like a rock, and here last night the bed was so soft,' Bryant enthused. 'I’m like a little kid learning to walk again.'

After being told he was a free man, Bryant shouted out cries of joy and revealed how his parents never believed he was innocent.

According to the Post, he 
tearfully said outside court: 'I just wanna go to church and get on my 
knees and pray for my mother 
and father because they never believed me.

'I wish they were alive today so that I could tell them that I didn’t do it.'

The New York Times reports the judge found the failure of Bryant's attorney
 to consult with a blood and semen testing expert deprived him of a fair
 trial.

Free at last: David Bryant cries tears of joy after being released from prison

The
 then-18-year-old Bryant was arrested less than a day after the 
discovery of New York City girl Karen Smith's body in the stairwell of 
an apartment house. She'd been raped, beaten and stabbed.

A spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's office says no decision has been made on appealing the judge's ruling.

Bryant
 was freed after the advocacy group, The Centurion Ministries, filed a 
motion because it believed Bryant was wrongfully convicted.

It claimed he received poor counsel 
because Bryant's court-appointed lawyer did no question semen and blood 
evidence which was picked up at the scene of the crime.

It was discovered that Bryant's blood type did not match semen found at the scene where the youngster was killed.

After being left shocked by the decision, Bryant realised he would quickly need to come to terms with how the world has changed during his time in prison.

He said: 'You come out and you see all the changes and you don’t know if you’re going to make the adaptations to this new life.'

To celebrate his new-found freedom, Bryant said he wanted a box of Kentucky Fried Chicken, biscuits, Dunkin' Donuts and Pepsi.
