Britain's longest-serving train driver has finally retired after 52 years and much to the amusement of his family and colleagues, he pulled into the station for the final time five minutes late.

Bruce Parkin, 67, has driven the equivalent of 200 times around the earth during his half-century on the tracks.

Mr Parkin started out at the tender age of 15 cleaning steam trains and became an assistant driver three years later in 1964 and a fully-qualified driver in 1980.

Over the years he has clocked up an estimated four million miles on Britain's rails - most of it between London and the West Country.

Around 60 colleagues and rail staff turned out to greet him at his home station of Bristol Temple Meads for the last time.

Mr Parkin took daughter Katie Allen, 33, and grandson Joshua, seven, along for his final journey on the 10.30am from Paddington.

Rapturous applause broke out as the veteran driver stepped onto platform 15.

He said: 'It was a real shock as everyone came into view. I didn't expect so many people to turn out on my last day.

'I only thought there would be one or two but I am delighted, absolutely delighted to see everyone.'

Mr Parkin, from Bristol, added: 'I have got on so well with the job because I've always loved trains.

'I was always interested in train driving from a very young age so it was a natural career.

'I just love driving trains and I have loved the job. I'm going to miss the role and the chaps I work with.'

Bosses at First Great Western set aside part of the first class compartment for members of Mr Parkin's family on his final journey.

His grandson Joshua said: 'I've never been in the cab of the train before. It was amazing.

'I watched him press all the buttons but he didn't let me drive it.'
