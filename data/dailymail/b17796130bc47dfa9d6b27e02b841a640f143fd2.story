Sir Stanley Matthews' 1953 FA Cup winner's medal has sold for a staggering £220,000 at auction.

The medal stole the show with Ray Wilson and Jimmy Greaves' 1966 World Cup winner's medals also up for sale at Sotheby's auction house in London.

Wilson's medal was sold for £136,000 while Greaves' medal, given to him retrospectively in 2009 as he did not play in the final, went for £44,000.

But it was Matthews' FA Cup winning feat which prompted furious bidding for the much sought-after item - owned by television presenter Nick Hancock who paid just £20,000 for it in 2001.

The medal had a guide price of between £30,000 and £50,000 but there was much interest in it before the auctions began.

Starting at £50,000, five bidders contested the item on the phone and there were several more in the packed Book Room at Sotheby's.

In the space of just three minutes that price had rocketed to £220,000.

It eventually went to an anonymous bidder who purchased it due to Matthews' playing for Blackpool.

Matthews finally won the FA Cup with Blackpool after finishing runner-up twice in three years.

In front of a 100,000-strong crowd at Wembley - in the first televised FA Cup final - he starred as Blackpool came back from 3-1 down against Bolton to win in extra time.

Although Stan Mortensen netted a hat-trick, the game is known as the 'Matthews final' as he put in a magical display on the right wing and set up three goals to win it.

Left-back Wilson's medal had a guide price of between £100,000 and £120,000 – far more than Matthews' – but the bidding was less frantic and it went for £136,000.

Greaves' medal was up next and managed to out-do it's guide price of £20,000 to £40,000 by going for £44,000.

Greaves picked up an injury in England's final group game and did not play again in the tournament - Geoff Hurst took his place.

Tottenham legend Greaves was awarded the medal five years ago after a campaign by fans.

All the items in Tuesday's auction went to anonymous bidders.
