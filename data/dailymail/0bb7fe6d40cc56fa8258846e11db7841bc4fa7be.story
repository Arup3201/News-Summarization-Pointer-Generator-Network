Nicky Morgan introduced guidelines forcing schools to promote British values

Ofsted inspectors asked ten year olds at a Christian school if they knew what lesbians 'did' to check they were being taught about British values, it has been claimed.

Grindon Hall Christian School has made a formal complaint over an 'intrusive' inspection conducted in the wake of the Trojan Horse controversy over Islamist attempts to infiltrate schools.

Inspectors are also said to have questioned pupils about transsexuality and asked if any of their friends felt trapped in the 'wrong body'.

The school is among a growing number to complain they have been unfairly penalised by rules designed to combat extremism.

There are claims that some schools – mainly those with a religious ethos or located in rural areas with few ethnic minority pupils – have been put under undue pressure by a new requirement to promote British values.

Grindon Hall, which teaches pupils aged four to 18, has a Christian ethos but no faith-based selection criteria, resulting in an intake that includes pupils from various religions.

Principal Chris Gray was a supporter of the British values initiative when details were published last year but inspectors' unannounced visit to the school last November led him to complain to Ofsted that the 'tenor of the inspection was negative and hostile'.

It was 'as if the data collected had to fit a pre-determined outcome', he said, and many of the questions 'seem to betray an underlying disrespect for the Christian faith'.

Pupils were asked whether anyone in their school had two mums or dads.

When the inspectors were giving feedback to staff on their findings, 'it was suggested that a response from one child to the effect of querying how it is possible to have two mums was viewed as indicating a lack of awareness of lesbian relationships', the complaint letter said.

Grindon Hall Christian School has formally complained about Ofsted inspectors whose questioning of pupils 'crossed the line'

'I understand the child concerned was merely thinking in biological terms. In addition, I have also heard reports of primary schoolchildren being asked if they knew of any boys or girls who thought they were in the 'wrong body'.

The so-called Trojan Horse plot was an alleged attempt to introduce a hardline Islamist ethos into six Birmingham schools.

It was revealed in a letter leaked in March last year, alleged to be from Islamists detailing how to wrest control of a school and speculating about using the scheme in other cities.

It included claims that male and female pupils were segregated, non-Muslim staff were driven out and a strict religious agenda was imposed.

A three-month Ofsted inquiry, which reported in June last year, found the schools did not do enough to protect children from extremism.

In the wake of the findings, the Department for Education announced that all schools must promote 'British values' of tolerance and fairness and warned that teachers would be banned from the profession if they allowed extremists into schools.

Proposals would also allow Ofsted to visit any school without warning, saying the schools in the plot had previously been able to stage a 'cover-up'.

'Another parent has complained to me that her ten-year-old daughter was asked if she knew what lesbians 'did'.'

They also allegedly questioned children as young as six about their knowledge of Hindu festivals and the Jewish Torah.

He suggested that the questioning of pupils 'crossed the line into harassment'.

Sixth-formers at the school have also prepared written complaints, claiming that inspectors appeared to be 'manipulating' the conversation during group discussions about racism and homophobia, seemingly determined to 'discredit' the school.

The guidelines, introduced by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan last year, require schools actively to promote 'British values' including democracy, liberty and tolerance.' 

Other institutions said to have unfairly fallen foul of the rules include a Christian school in Reading, Berkshire, that says it was warned it could face closure for failing to invite imams and other religious leaders to take assemblies.

In another case, a high-performing primary school in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, was marked down because pupils lacked 'first-hand experience of the diverse make-up of modern British society'. Inspectors made no allowance for the fact that 97 per cent of the population of the town is white.

An Ofsted spokesman said it would be 'considering the issues raised by the school' and added: 'Ofsted does not require evidence that schools 'promote' other faiths. Instead, inspectors must ensure that pupils are able to express views which are neither intolerant nor discriminatory towards others.'
