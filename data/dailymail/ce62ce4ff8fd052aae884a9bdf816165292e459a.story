Tragic: Charlie Timbrell, 15 months, was rushed to hospital after being rescued from the blaze at the flat in Prestatyn

A third child has died in hospital two days after being injured in a house fire which also killed his mother and two cousins.

Charlie Timbrell, 15 months, was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for treatment, but succumbed to his injuries this afternoon.

His mother Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and cousins Skye Allen, aged two, Bailey Allen, four, all perished after a first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North Wales was engulfed by flames on Friday night.

Charlie's father and Miss Shiers' partner Liam Timbrell, 23, are currently in a critical condition in hospital.

North Wales Police have arrested two ground-floor tenants; a man, aged 45, and a woman, aged 42, on suspicion of murder.

Firefighters dragged the five victims from the flat in Maes Y Groes, Prestatyn, at 10pm on Friday night.

A Welsh Ambulance Services spokeswoman said the survivors were taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital.

Mr Timbrell, who remains in a critical condition, was later transferred to Whiston Hospital, Merseyside.

Victims: Bailey Allen, four, and two-year-old Skye Allen, were inside the first-floor flat when the fire broke out

Miss Shiers' friend Chloe Hopkins, 20, described her as a 'devoted mum' to Charlie.

'I'm just devastated,' she told The Sun newspaper.

'She was the kindest person - she would do anything for anyone.

'I can't think of anyone who would want to do this to her.'

Forensic
teams have been meticulously gathering evidence at fire-damaged homes 
in the quiet side street of Maes-y-Groes in Prestatyn.

Friends have been paying tribute to young mum Miss Shiers on Facebook.

Ruth Evans described her as 'the happiest girl' in a post on the social networking site.

While Samantha Jadee added that the 20-year-old was 'always smiling'.

Josie Roberts also said on Facebook: 'R.i.p lee-anna you were such an amazing girl very kind and was there for everyone that needed help. Such sad news my thoughtsgoes out to her family xxx.'

Detective Superintendent John Chapman 
said: 'My heart goes out to the family and our thoughts are with them at
this difficult time.'

Family liaison officers were working closely with the victims' next of kin, the detective said.

Neighbours arrested: A man, 45, and woman, 42, who lived on the ground floor beneath the first-floor flat have been arrested on suspicion of murder

'Terrible tragedy': Neighbours tried in vain to mount a rescue attempt from the flat. Skye Allen, two, left, and four-year-old Bailey Allen, right, were inside

'There is a team of dedicated officers working on specific lines of inquiry in relation to this incident,' he added.

Resident Adele Gordon told Sky News: 'This man started running up the street going "my kids are in there, my kids are in there".

'I've never seen smoke like it. Thick black smoke billowing out of the house. It was mad.

'They started pulling people out of windows.'

Neighbours
tried to rescue those inside, putting a ladder up against the house and
trying to get through the front door but the flames were too fierce.

Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Apparently the next door neighbour tried to get a ladder up to the window of the top flat.'

House fire: Firefighters managed to pull Lee-Anna Shiers' partner Liam Timbrell and their 15-month-old son Charlie from the blaze

Investigating: North Wales Fire and Rescue Service and North Wales Police are investigating the blaze in the residential street

Resident rescue: Neighbours tried to rescue those inside, putting a ladder against the house wall only to be forced back by the flames before firefighters arrived on the scene

'My kids are in there': Neighbours saw a man running through the street yelling 'my kids are in there'

A
fire and rescue spokesman said: 'At the rear of the premises, attempts 
were made to access the first floor level but again unfortunately the 
fire prevented this from happening.

'The fire very rapidly spread.'

He said that firefighters entered the
building through the front door and found the man on the first floor 
near a window. The other victims were also found on the first floor. 
They were brought out via the staircase.

Detective Superintendent John Chapman said: 'My staff are working on several lines of inquiry.

'The investigation will be difficult, as it is always with the death of a child. Several children in this case.'

A North Wales Police spokeswoman 
said: ‘Firefighters from North Wales Fire and Rescue Service were called
to a fire at a property in Maes Y Groes, Prestatyn, at 10pm on Friday, 
October 20 2012.

‘Two fire crews from Rhyl and a crew from Prestatyn attended the incident and firefighters wearing breathing apparatus entered the property.’

Shocked locals: Upset and surprised by what happened last night, a passerby delivering flowers to the scene

A joint investigation is now being 
carried out between North Wales Fire and Rescue Service and North Wales 
Police at the house converted into flats.

They will investigate what caused the fire and whether any accelerants were used.

A Welsh Ambulance Services spokeswoman said the man and baby were taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital.

The
man was later transferred to Whiston Hospital, Merseyside in a serious condition, while the 
baby was transferred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. His condition is said to be critical.

Police confirmed the dead children were related to the woman, the 20-year-old was not their mother. Her partner was not related to the children.

A large police cordon was in place yesterday, blocking public access to the street, as fire crews began packing
away their equipment and the investigation into the cause of the blaze 
got under way.

One woman, who lives close by, said a neighbour had tried to mount a rescue as fire crews rushed to the scene.

The woman, who did not wish to be 
named, said: ‘There were two large bangs and at first I thought it was a
car crash because the road at the end of Maes Y Groes is quite busy.

‘I looked out of the window and saw there was smoke but I couldn't tell which house it was.

'It was mad': Neighbour Adele Horton said thick black smoke billowing out of the house. Another resident said she heard two loud bangs before she saw the flames

‘When I looked out later on, I saw the man on the floor as the paramedics tried to help him.

‘I knew kiddies lived in that house because you'd hear them playing or crying as you walked past but I don't know any of the adults.

‘It's so sad that two little ones have died, a terrible tragedy.’

Another neighbour, Mike Foster said: 'I can’t believe it. I'm just in shock. I didn’t even know them but I’m just so upset.'

All the casualties are local to the Prestatyn area.

Baby in hospital: A 23-year-old man and a 15-month-old baby boy were taken to hospital. The man is in a serious condition while the baby's condition is said to be critical
