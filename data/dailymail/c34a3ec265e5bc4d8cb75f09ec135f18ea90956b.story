Joyce Thacker, director of Rotherham's children's services (above) has finally resigned in the wake of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal

The chief of Rotherham children’s services finally stepped down yesterday, three weeks after the publication of a damning report into child abuse in the town.

Joyce Thacker is the fourth senior official to resign in the wake of the investigation, which found there had been ‘serious failings’ by the council and the police in protecting 1,400 victims of grooming gangs. She had clung on to her £115,000-a-year position despite repeated calls to quit.

The council announced she had left her role with immediate effect, five days after she had been put on long-term sick leave.

Mrs Thacker, 56, follows in the steps of three others who have left their jobs –South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright, Rotherham’s Labour council leader Roger Stone, and council chief executive Martin Kimber.

She was deputy director of children’s services before taking over at the department in 2008 and has been at the centre of the controversy sparked by the Jay Report, which highlighted the widespread exploitation of children in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013.

Until yesterday she seemed determined to stay in her role – repeatedly insisting that her leadership was essential for the continuity of services in the town.

Mrs Thacker told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee last week that she had given a ‘lot of thought’ to resigning but insisted she had ‘worked hard’ to improve services in Rotherham.

Asked what she and Mr Wright had done about the problem, Mrs Thacker replied: ‘We knew about child sexual exploitation and abuse but we didn’t know the scale of it ... I have worked tirelessly to improve things in Rotherham and make sure that people understood it was everyone’s business to stop this.’

But Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, said the whole committee believed Mrs Thacker should quit.

She has a long track record of defiance in the face of public criticism. Even after several critical reports into the council’s failure to deal with the problem, Mrs Thacker told the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board that she did not want them to focus entirely on child abuse.

According to minutes of a meeting in March this year, she ‘reiterated’ that the council, social services and police ‘need to retain a sense of proportionality with regard to child sexual exploitation’. She said it was a very important issue but that child neglect was ‘a much more significant problem in the borough.’

Professor Alex Jay’s report into the abuse crisis in Rotherham was highly critical of her leadership.
