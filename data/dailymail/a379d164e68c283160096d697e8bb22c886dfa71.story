Arsenal's Jack Wilshere will miss Tuesday's Champions League clash against Anderlecht with a virus but Arsene Wenger says the midfielder will be fit for Sunday's game against Swansea.

Wilshere, who is also suffering from a minor knee injury, missed Monday's training session - but did report to the club's London Colney HQ. 

Wenger  also revealed that Aaron Ramsey, who is fit again, has suffered with illness over the past few days - but the Gunners boss insists they are the only two who have been struck down by the bug.

'He (Wilshere) has been sick and won't play tomorrow, he can be fit for the weekend,' confirmed Wenger.

No less than six first-teamers are on the sidelines, including Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud.

Arsenal have six points from their opening three Champions League fixtures. 

They could seal qualification to the knockout stages with two games to spare if they beat Anderlecht and Borussia Dortmund overcome Galatasaray.

'If we can seal qualification I would describe the feeling as satisfied to have the job done,' Wenger said.

'We respect Anderlecht because they gave us a tough game and we had a bit of a miraculous win because we needed to go until the last minute.

'We have been warned and now we want to win the game again at the Emirates.'

Since beating Anderlecht, Arsenal have recorded consecutive Barclays Premier League wins over Sunderland and Burnley, scoring five goals and conceding none.
