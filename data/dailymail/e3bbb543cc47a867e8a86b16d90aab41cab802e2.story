When it comes to gardening competitions, Peter Glazebrook is a giant in his field.

The 68-year-old has just smashed his own record for producing the world’s largest onion.

The prize vegetable weighed in at 18lb 1oz, breaking his previous best by almost 2oz.

Not content with his huge onion, the 
retired chartered surveyor also brought an 82lb cabbage to the Harrogate
 Autumn Flower Show – having to transport the vegetable in a 
wheelbarrow.

Mr Glazebrook, 68, from Newark has a knack for producing oversized vegetables, winning all six classes in the giant vegetable section during yesterday’s show at the Great Yorkshire Showground.

The amateur farmer holds an array of world records for his prowess in the garden.

Earlier this year, Mr Glazebrook produced the world’s longest parsnip – measuring 18.5ft, 36 times longer than a normal parsnip.

Added to that achievement, Mr Glazebrook has been a double Guinness World Record holder for growing the heaviest parsnip.

He has also grown the world’s largest beetroot and the heaviest potato, weighing 8lbs 40oz.

Mr Glazebrook had been attempting to cultivate a record-breaking onion for 25 years until setting a new record at last year’s Harrogate Flower Show.

Speaking at the time, he said he seeded his onions rather than eating them.

He said: ‘If you did I should think it could feed a thousand people. It would certainly do for a lot of hotdogs.’
