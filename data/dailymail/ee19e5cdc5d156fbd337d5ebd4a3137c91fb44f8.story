A devoted cat owner claims her beloved moggies saved her life by alerting her to the fact she had cancer.

Stephanie Doody, 55, had no symptoms of the disease - but says her three feline friends repeatedly nudged her stomach.

Her doctor later discovered a tumour on her appendix – a rare cancer usually has no symptoms and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late.

Mrs Doody credits her cat Jaffy (pictured) and her other two moggies Dinky and Rennie for helping alert her to a tumour on her appendix, which is usually symptomless and normally goes undiagnosed until it is too late

Mrs Doody from Tamworth, Staffordshire, who has now had surgery and is recovering, said: 'They have saved my life.

'I adored them in the first place, but this just made my love for them even stronger.'

Cats Rennie, Dinky and Jaffy first noticed something was wrong in February 2014.

Mrs Doody claims they constantly followed her around and sat on her lap poking at her abdomen.

In July, six months after the cats first indicated a problem, she found a small lump after losing some weight and headed to her doctor.

It was originally thought she had an ovarian cyst, but this was later dismissed, as were ovarian cancer and bowel cancer as possible causes.

As doctors were baffled about what type of cancer she had, Mrs Doody needed the support of her husband Jonathan Ball, 65,  one of her step-daughters Kaity - a dermatologist who works with skin cancer sufferers - as well as her beloved cats.

After listening to her pets' intuition, and losing some weight, Mrs Doody found a lump on her stomach which turned out to be cancerous. She  underwent a complex 12 hour operation to remove part of a section of her bowel along with her appendix, spleen, gall bladder and cervix (pictured)

They started researching the symptomless condition and Mrs Doody was eventually diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei.

This is a rare cancer of the appendix, and she began treatment at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital in September.

In October she underwent a life-saving 12-hour operation at George Elliot Hospital, all thanks to her three pets.

The incredibly complex and invasive operation was carried out by two teams of surgeons who removed a section of her bowel along with her appendix, spleen, gall bladder and cervix.

Dogs can be trained to smell cancer in its early stages, according to charity Medical Detection Dogs.

The organisation now has 12 dogs who live with host families and come to work from Monday to Friday at the charity's headquarters near Milton Keynes, detecting traces of cancer from urine and breath samples.

They are trained by sniffing urine samples of people with cancer and rewarded when they single out these samples from other urine from non-cancer sufferers.

Malignant cells produce changes in volatile organic compounds, and it's these compounds which dogs are believed to detect in urine.

Dogs can detect odours at concentrations as low as one part per trillion, identifying scents which the human nose could never detect.

Humans have five million sensor receptors dedicated to smell - dogs have 300 million, the charity says.

The procedure also involved a full hysterectomy and left her with a huge scar, which her grandchildren have nicknamed 'Nana's zipper'.

But Mrs Doody says she has her cats to thank for saving her life.

She said: 'I absolutely believe the cats knew. 

'The cancer is a molecular change in your body so you give off a different smell that they pick up on and they just try to get your attention.

'For a while my cats had been following me around but that's normal - they're cats and that's what they do.

'But it got more and more intense and for months they stayed with me everywhere I went.

'If wasn't until the day I got back from the doctors that they disappeared into their normal spots.

'It was as if they were saying, "finally, you've discovered it". It was unbelievable.

'The surgery was horrendous and I was in intensive care for a couple of days on morphine but I would have died without it.

'Even thinking was hard work, I couldn't talk properly or move without becoming exhausted.

'I was overwhelmed by the goodwill and wishes of not just family, but friends and people from work.

'It was unbelievable, they were seriously concerned and upset, not only that I had cancer but that I had to go through all of that. 

'I absolutely believe the cats knew,' Mrs Doody says.
