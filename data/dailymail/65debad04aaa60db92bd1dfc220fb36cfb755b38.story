Two fraternity brothers have died and three have suffered injuries after one is believed to have fallen asleep behind the wheel.

The group's car veered into oncoming traffic and collided with an 18-wheeler semi truck at 8.30am on Friday as they drove from Northeastern Illinois University in Chicago to Tucson, Arizona for a fraternity leadership conference. The 1,700-mile trip would have taken more than 25 hours.

Victor Maldonado, 18, who was driving the 2006 Chevrolet Impala, and 23-year-old David Roman both died in the wreck, which occurred on U.S. 54 about six miles from Dalhart, Texas.

Maldonado may have fallen asleep while driving, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Olivia Gonzalez told the Chicago Tribune. Roman was a back-seat passenger behind Moldonado.

Killed: Victor Maldonado, 18, left, was driving a car with four of his frat brothers inside when it veered into oncoming traffic and crashed into a semi truck. He died along with 23-year-old David Roman, right

Mourning: The men, who were students in Chicago, were heading to a conference for their fraternity, Omega Delta Phi, in Arizona when they crashed. The fraternity released this tribute to their brothers

They were both pronounced dead after the crash, while the three other passengers - David Rubio, 19, Kyle Thomas, 21, and Seth Amofa, 19 - were taken to a hospital in Amarillo.

Denny Esquivel, a founder of the Northeatern Illinois University chapter of Omega Delta Phi, told the Tribune that the men are expected to recover.

'They're all
 doing better,' he said. 'They're a little banged up. One has a broken femur and 
another has broken ribs. The hospital said theyâ€™re going to 
be OK.'

Two men in the semi-truck, aged 29 and 50, 
were taken to hospital but were not hurt, and Gonzalez said the crash is considered an accident. 
Driving conditions were clear at the time.

All five students belong to the Omega Delta Phi fraternity and were heading to a fraternity conference at the time of the crash.

Injured: Kyle Thomas, left pictured with Maldonado, was also in the car but is expected to recover

Brothers: Two others, Seth Amofa (third from left) or David Rubio (fourth from left), were also hurt

'It was their first national conference 
that they were going to be able to go to,' Esquivel said. 'They were 
super excited to go.'

Northeastern spokeswoman 
Beth Campus added: 'It's very sad. 'It's a tragic event and we are trying to be there for
 the students. It's a very sad time for the university and for their 
families.'

On Sunday, students gathered to mourn the students at a vigil at the school.

'It's like having an out of body experience,' Victor Maldonado Sr. told ABC7 of his son. 'I'm just hoping that he calls to say they have the wrong person.'

Their frat brother, Esquivel, described Roman and Maldonado as 'go getters'.

'They had a lot of energy,' he said. 'They really wanted to accomplish a lot in life.'

Long journey: The students took off from their university in Chicago for Tucson, Arizona on Thursday, but on Friday morning they crashed the car near to Dalhart, Texas

He said that Maldonado, who was studying 
business management, was involved in the community and in volunteering 
at soup kitchens, and will be remembered as also wanting to have fun.

Roman, a close friend with Maldonado, was majoring in chemistry and enjoyed basketball and boxing.

A statement released about the tragedy on the fraternity's website said: 'These two stand up young men were on their way to a conference in Tucson, AZ.

'Today we are asking for your help as their families go through this difficult moment in their lives.'

The fraternity has set up a donation page for the families.
