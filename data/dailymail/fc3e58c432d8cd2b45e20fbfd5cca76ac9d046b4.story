Gerard Depardieu has revealed he was once a rent boy and a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car

He is regarded as one of the most prolific and talented character actors to grace the screen and it appears his ability to adapt to any role given can be traced back to his childhood.

Gerard Depardieu has revealed he was once a rent boy, a petty thief who served three weeks in prison for stealing a car and also turned his hand to grave robbing before being saved from destitution by a gay theatre talent spotter who paid for him to study French drama.

The 65-year-old award-winning actor makes his confessions confessions in his autobiography, called 'it happened like that' (Ca c'est fait comme ca) in which he also tells of his unexpected friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president and the death of his son Guillaume in 2008.

Depardieu, who became a household name in Britain for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy Green Card alongside Andie MacDowell, reveals as a toddler he became accustomed to hearing his mother tell him about her attempts to abort him using knitting needles adding: 'And to think I almost killed you.' His family was so poor that as a child he helped deliver his siblings as his parents could not afford a midwife.

Depardieu writes he began to wander the streets when he was just 10 but could easily pass for being 15 - and quickly realised he was attractive to men.

He said: 'I've known since I was very young that I please homosexuals' and added when men approached, asking for sex, 'I would ask them for money'.

He also admits he occasionally helped a man to dig up newly buried bodies in the cemetery and steal jewellery and shoes from them.

At 16, he served three weeks in prison for stealing a car but continued his career as a rent boy after moving from Châteauroux, in central France, where he grew up, to Paris. Occasionally he would mug his clients.

'At 20, the thug in me was alive and kicking,' he writes.

'I would rip some of them off. I would beat up some bloke and leave with all his money.'

He also describes stealing watches and money from students taking part in the May 1968 anti-government protests, picking their pockets as they slept on the street in between skirmishes with police.

At one point he also routinely charmed his way into a Nato base where he bought cigarettes to sell for twice what he had paid.

Describing himself as a 'rough-hewn peasant' he eventually married actress Elisabeth Guignot, who is from a well-off Parisian family and they had two children, Guillaume and Julie. He had two more with two other women: but family life and the role of father is not one that Depardieu plays well.

When his children have complained about being associated with him he writes he has told them: 'What do you want? Change your name, for heaven's sake, if it bothers you.'

The confessions of the Cyrano de Bergerac star also shed new light on the tragic life of Guillaume who was also an actor. He also admitted to working as a rent boy when he was broke and he served two prison sentences for theft and drugs. He died of viral pneumonia in 2008, aged 37.

Depardieu blames his inability to tell his children he loved them on his father Dede, a metalworker and volunteer fireman who said very little. 'I could never find the words,' he writes. 'I know how to speak the words of others, but when it comes to my own, I am the son of Dédé.'

Depardieu, a drinker and gourmet, is well known for rumbustious behaviour. He has crashed his scooter when drunk, attacked photographers and outraged fellow aircraft passengers by urinating in the aisle.

The actor recently boasted of drinking 14 bottles a day, starting with champagne in the morning and ending with whisky at night. He claims his drinking is not a sign he is an alcoholic but a man hounded by phobias: 'I'm obsessed with the racket in my body, the beating of my heart, the gurgling of my intestines, my joints cracking,' he writes.

'It's become a phobia to the point that if I'm alone in a hotel I must drink so as not to hear it, so as not to go mad from it. I can't get to sleep unless I am dead drunk.'

He has little patience for the Socialist government of President François Hollande whom he blamed for leaving France in a 'filthy mess'. He fled the country last year for Belgium and Russia, where he became a citizen, to avoid paying what he said was an 87% tax bill.

'Are you happy now?' he claims to have bellowed down the phone at Hollande after telling him he was leaving.

Depardieu also tells of his friendship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. They first met in 2008 and immediately hit it off, recognising they had much in common.

'We could have both become hoodlums,' he writes. 'I think he immediately liked my hooligan side ... the fact that I had occasionally been picked up off the pavement dead drunk.

'Like with me, nobody would have betted a penny on him when he was 15.'

Depardieu reveals he regularly writes to Putin: 'It's very easy', he explains, 'I speak, there's a guy who taps it out in French then translates it into Russian and it arrives on Putin's desk. I send him letters that tell him about everything. He's like an old chum. It amuses him and he replies.'
