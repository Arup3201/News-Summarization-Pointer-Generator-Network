A motive for the terrifying shooting that claimed the lives of three teens at an Ohio school has begun to emerge as students say one of the victims was dating the alleged shooter's ex-girlfriend.

Speaking to ABC on the first day back to class since the tragic slaying, a group of students close to T.J. Lane's ex-girlfriend said that he had felt bitter and forgotten when she started to date Russell King Jr.

Russell, 17, was one of the five students shot in the killing spree at Chardon High School on Monday along with Demetrius Hewlin and Daniel Parmertor. Joy Rickers, 18, and Nick Walczak, 17, were injured.

Prosecutors argue that Lane, 17, had no
motive when he walked into the school cafeteria and shot ten 
people and that he did not personally know any of the students involved.

One of the students told ABC of Lane's ex-girlfriend: 'She saw something she liked in him [Lane] that others didn't see.'

After dating Lane, she and King started to date 
on and off, but the relationship became more serious in recent months, 
the friends said. They also said King had made jokes about Lane and said he was going to beat him up.

Prosecutor David Joyce alleged at Lane's first court appearance that 
Lane 'did not know the students, but chose them randomly'.

'This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs. 
This is someone who is not well,' he said.

The students said they did not believe
this and they had heard the alleged shooter had been doing weights in recent weeks to 
bulk up so he could fight his love rival.

Nate Mueller, who was sitting at the table with the victims the day of 
the shooting, told ABC News that he watched Lane take his second shot.

'That shot I saw TJ take had hit Russell and he was over the 
table in a pool of blood, and Demetrius was on the floor in a 
puddle of blood next to him. Nick had not been
hit yet as I jumped over him.'

Hundreds of supporters, parents and 
students had marched to the school on Thursday in honour of those who 
were killed in the shooting, before classes resumed today.

T.J. Lane was charged on Thursday 
with killing three students; Demetrius Hewlin, 16, Russell King Jr., 17,
and Daniel Parmertor, 16.

He is also charged with wounding Joy
Rickers and Nick Walczak. While Ms Rickers was released from hospital, 
Mr Walczak's family said the 16-year-old he has been left paralysed by 
the shooting and has two bullets still lodged in his body.

Lane, who attends an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools, admitted taking a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to Chardon High and firing 10 shots at a group of students sitting at a cafeteria table, prosecutor David Joyce said.

Children convicted of juvenile crimes in
Ohio are typically behind bars only until they turn 21 in the most 
serious cases. But Joyce has said he plans to charge Lane as an adult, 
meaning he could face life in prison without parole if convicted of 
similar adult charges. Minors are not eligible for the death penalty in 
Ohio.

Earlier Thursday, students had gathered around a courthouse square gazebo, quietly singing their alma mater before marching by the hundreds to their reopened school, holding hands and linking arms.

'I'm just scared for everybody, and I don't know how everybody is going to act going back into school,' said freshman Theodore Rosch, 16.

Friday also marked the start of a series of memorial services for the slain students. A visitation was scheduled in Eastlake for Daniel Parmertor, and his funeral Mass is Saturday morning.

Frank Hall, assistant football coach, said he prayed with the victim's in their last moments

Hewlin attended Chardon High. King and Parmertor were vocational school students, waiting in the Chardon High cafeteria for their daily bus when they were shot.

The assistant football coach credited with chasing the gunman from the school said Thursday that he wanted the victims' families to know he had tried to comfort the children.

'I prayed with them. I wiped their tears and I know God was with them,' an emotional Frank Hall said.

Lane was a normal boy who excelled in school and played outside often with his sister, building snow hills and skateboarding, according to Steve Sawczak, a family friend who's a pastor and has worked with troubled children.

Lane came from a broken family and began 
living with his grandparents on and off several years ago.

The grandparents are reported to feel terrible about 
what happened and have no explanation for the teen's alleged role in the
shootings.

A police report said 33 officers from 
around the area responded to what was first described as a 'shooting 
accidental.' Emergency crews from four fire departments also responded.
