As the darkness set in last night, star gazers throughout the world looked up at the sky in the hopes of catching a glimpse the spectacular Perseid meteor shower.

Despite patches of cloud cover and a bright supermoon, the shower provided some stunning views as it lit up the skies with streaks of up to 100 shooting stars per hour.

The annual shower occurs every August and is caused by debris from the huge Swift-Tuttle comet falling into the Earth's atmosphere.

The Perseid meteor shower is seen here over the village of Grafham in Cambridgeshire. It was taken in the early hours of this morning by photographer Matt Power

Matthew Power, a British photographer, was able to capture the first pictures of the Perseid meteor shower which reached a peak early this morning.

Mr Power managed to get a good view of the display at Grafham in Cambridgeshire at about 2.30BST this morning.

'The conditions weren't great, but I'm absolutely thrilled I managed to see the meteor shower and get a picture,' Mr Power said. 'The moon was still very bright which made it hard.'

Dr Bill Cooke from Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office has described Perseids is the undisputed 'fireball champion' of meteor showers.

'We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,' he said.

This stunning photograph shows the trail of the Swift-Tuttle comet over Kent.  Robert Canis was up photographing between the hours of 1am and 4am BST this morning taking 300 photos in a time lapse. The comet is seen on top left, with a blue trail which appeared at 2.54 BST with other star trails circling the North Star (top left)

Nasa tweeted this image on the 12 of August. The meteor from the shower was obvious despite the bright glare of the supermoon, which also lit up the sky

The Perseids, which peak during mid-August, are considered to be the best meteor shower of the year. 

With very fast and bright meteors, Perseids frequently leave long 'wakes' of light and colour behind them as they streak through the Earth's atmosphere. 

The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers (50-100 meteors seen per hour) and occurs with warm summer nighttime weather, allowing sky watchers to easily view the shower. Perseids are also known for their fireballs. Fireballs are larger explosions of light and colour that can persist longer

Meanwhile Photographer Robert Canis from Kent was up early photographing between the hours of 1am and 4am BST taking 300 photos in a time lapse

The result was an image that showed the comet, with a blue trail which appeared at 2.54am BST with other star trails circling the North Star caused by Earth's rotation.

For those who missed the display last night, there is a chance to catch it again tonight in Britain, Europe or North America.

Tony Markham, director of the Society for Popular Astronomy's (Spa) meteor section, urged skywatchers to stay optimistic.

'The Perseids are rich in bright meteors and so many Perseids will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background,' he said, writing on the SPA's website.

'You can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the Cassiopeia/Cepheus/Ursa Minor area.

'If possible, keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building.'

This image of the Persied shower was shared by Nasa on the 12 August. For those who missed the display last night, there is a chance to catch it again tonight
