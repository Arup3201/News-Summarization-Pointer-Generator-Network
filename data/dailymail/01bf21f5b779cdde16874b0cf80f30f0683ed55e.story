Video footage of a mystery blonde roaring support for her home team during a handball competition has gone viral in Russia with locals saying she has the scariest voice in the world.

The blonde is seen at a match between Macedonia's Metalurg Skopje and Admiral at the Fetisov Arena in Vladivostok, a city in eastern Russia.

Surrounded by men standing and cheering she sits on a sit and roars in a voice more suited to a horror film.

Local fan Gennady Averyanov, 36, said: 'I was watching the game with my boy and it was going well when all of a sudden we heard this deep, terrifying sound from behind us.

'We looked round and saw a blonde woman in a white jacket and bobble hat sitting and literally roaring.'

'It sounded like a monster and my son was not sure whether to laugh - or run for it.

'If that's what she sounds like when she's happy I feel sorry for someone she falls out with.'

Now viewers have posted online with similar comments.

One person calling himself VK201 said: 'Wow! They should sign her up for a Lion cereal commercial.'

Another commentator said: 'I reckon she didn't really get the point of cheering, she clearly needs a few lessons.'

A spokesman for the arena said: 'Fans express their delight in many ways and we certainly don't have a problem with a woman roaring.

'As long as there is no violence, we are happy.'
