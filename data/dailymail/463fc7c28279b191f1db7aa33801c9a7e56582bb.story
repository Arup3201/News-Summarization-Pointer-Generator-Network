Nasa's Cassini probe has found that the dunes on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan vary in shape just like dunes on Earth - and even look similar to deserts on our planet.

The similarities end there, of course - not only are the dunes on Titan 300 feet high and up to a mile wide, they're made of frozen hydrocarbons - chemicals found in crude oil - rather than sand.

There are four million square miles of dunes on Titan, an area the size of the United States. Their formations could be key to understanding the clouded moon's mysterious weather patterns.

The huge dunes of frozen hydrocarbons on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan were captured by Nasa's Cassini probe - and the geographical variations on Titan are similar to variations on Earth

Analysis of images sent back by Nasa's orbiting Cassini probe found that the dunes form patterns similar to deserts on Earth.

The result gives new clues about the moon’s climatic and geological history.Dune fields are the second most dominant landform on Titan, after the seemingly uniform plains, so they offer a large-scale insight into the moon’s peculiar environment.

Though similar in shape to the linear dunes found on Earth in Namibia or the Arabian Peninsula, Titan’s dunes are gigantic by our standards.

They are on average 0.6 to 1.2 mileswide, hundreds of miles long and around 300 feet (100 meters) high. However, their size and spacing vary across the surface, betraying the environment in which they have formed and evolved.

Using radar data from the Cassini spacecraft, Alice Le Gall, a former postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, and collaborators have discovered that the size of Titan’s dunes is controlled by at least two factors: altitude and latitude.

More elevated dunes tend to be thinner and more widely separated.

The gaps between the dunes seem to appear to Cassini’s radar, indicating a thinner covering of sand.

The sand needed to build the dunes seems to be mostly found in the lowlands of Titan.Scientists think the sand on Titan is not made of silicates as on Earth, but of solid hydrocarbons, precipitated out of the atmosphere.

These have then fiormed  into grains 0.04 inch in size by a still unknown process.In terms of latitude, the sand dunes on Titan are confined to its equatorial region, in a band between 30 degrees south latitude and 30 degrees north latitude. However, the dunes tend to be less voluminous toward the north. Le Gall and colleagues think that this may be due to Saturn’s elliptical orbit.

Each season on Titan lasts for about seven years. The slightly elliptical nature of Saturn’s orbit means that the southern hemisphere of Titan has shorter but more intense summers. So the southern regions are probably drier, which implies they have less ground moisture.

The drier the sand grains, the more easily they can be transported by the winds to make dunes. 'As one goes to the north, we believe the soil moisture probably increases, making the sand particles less mobile and, as a consequence, the development of dunes more difficult,' says Le Gall.Backing this hypothesis is the fact that Titan’s lakes and seas are not distributed symmetrically by latitude. These reserves of liquid ethane and methane are predominantly found in the northern hemisphere, suggesting again that the soil is moister toward the north and so, again, the sand grains are less easy to transport by the wind.'Understanding how the dunes form as well as explaining their shape, size and distribution on Titan’s surface is of great importance to understanding Titan’s climate and geology,' says Nicolas Altobelli, ESA’s Cassini-Huygens project scientist.
