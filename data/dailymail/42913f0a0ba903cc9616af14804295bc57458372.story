These are the joyous first strokes of a newborn hippopotamus, with its loving mother right there to help out.

The baby hippo, who was born yesterday at San Diego Zoo, was filmed Tuesday exploring the waters with its mother, Funani.

Zookeepers have not yet determined the name of the hippo calf, who is said to be bonding well with its mother. 

And they call it hippo love: The baby - yet to be named - and his mother Funani were pictured enjoying the water at San Diego Zoo, California

Observers have said Funani is nursing her newborn regularly - a process which will continue for the next eight months.

Adorable footage of the two together shows Funani nudging the calf through the main hippo tank at the attraction.

Later, the two relax at the water's edge.

Learning: Funani helped nudge her newborn through the water just a day after it was born

Bonding: Zookeepers say the two are getting along well together, and that Funani has been nursing the baby frequently

The calf's father, a 3.6-tonne hippo called Otis, was removed from their tank in anticipation of the birth. The two will be reunited later on.

Funani was born at Toledo Zoo in Ohio, and lived in Knoxville, Tennessee before coming West a decade ago.

She has given birth two 11 calves since 1989, the zoo said.

One was born last April, but died just five days later, according to the San Diego Times.

Hanging out: The two spent time at the edge of the water too, where the child nuzzled its mother

Veteran mom: Funani has given birth to 11 calves before, some when she lives in Knoxville, Tennessee
