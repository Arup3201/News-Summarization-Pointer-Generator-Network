Loic Remy's is happy to stay at QPR as long as a Champions League side doesn't come in for him according to manager Harry Redknapp, who also confirmed the club are in talks to sign Jonathan de Guzman.

French striker Remy nearly joined Liverpool earlier in the summer, before a medical scuppered a move.

But Redknapp has praised Remy's attitude and says the 27-year-old is ready for the new season in west London.

Back in business: Harry Redknapp hopes star striker Loic Remy will be fit to play at the weekend

Interest: Redknapp also admitted the club are in talks with VIllarreal midfielder Jonathan de Guzman

'We hope he stays because he's a fantastic player.' Redknapp told reporters. 'His attitude has been first class but you never know. He should be a £20m striker when I look at some of the prices.' 

'He says he wants to play on Saturday, and unless something crops up in the Champions League for him then he wants to stay. We've had other enquiries from Premier League clubs for him, but no one of that standard.'

Villarreal midfielder De Guzman has been linked with a return to the Premier League all summer, having completed two successful seasons on loan at Swansea.

And Redknapp admitted he is interested in the Dutchman, while he has also made an enquiry for Norwich's Leroy Fer.

'He's someone we are interested in, he's a good player. Tony and Phil are dealing with it. If it's doable then we will do it.'

Transfer targets: Redknapp spoke openly about several players, including Andros Townsend

Experience: Glenn Hoddle has joined the backroom staff QPR as a first-team coach

Gearing up: Rio Ferdinand stretches as he gets in shape for the new season

In a press conference full of the usual transfer links directed towards Redknapp, the boss also spoke of his delight to bring in Glenn Hoddle as a first-team coach, and said that Andros Towsnend was a player 'any club would want'.

But the news wasn't too joyful surrounding Adel Taarabt. The playmaker joined AC Milan on loan last season and is looking to move again, though Redknapp insists he isn't even fit yet.

'He wants to move, so we are looking for a club who wants to pay the money for him. 

'He isn't fit at the moment. He hasn't trained properly during pre season.' 

Not fit: Adel Taarabt has not got up to speed and wants to leave the club
