Australian travellers flying with Virgin and Qantas could soon connect their laptops, tablets and smart phones to wireless internet.

National Broadband Network (NBN Co) plans to make its satellites available to the two major Australian airlines in a bid to allow passengers to connect their personal devices while in flight.

NBN Co chief executive Bill Morrow said the company was in talks with Qantas and Virgin Australia but did not indicate the pricing or when it is expected to roll out, according to Sydney Morning Herald.

The $620 million Ka-band satellites currently cater for the three per cent of rural and remote areas of the country that does not have access to high-speed broadband services.

More than 124,000 farms, homes and businesses nationally, including more than 22,000 premises are currently connected to the services over the NBN's fixed wireless network.

Meanwhile, Qantas have announced that passengers can use their personal devices  in flight mode, for the duration of each flight, providing uninterrupted access to work and entertainment.

'On all A380, B747-400 and A330-300 aircraft you can send and receive text messages, make inflight telephone calls and perform seat to seat calls all from the comfort of your seat with our inflight telecommunication service,' Qantas said on its' page.

Qantas was approved to revise its personal electronic device policy by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority in August following new guidance on the safe use of personal electronic devices inflight.

Qantas Domestic Chief Executive Officer Lyell Strambi said the changes were an exciting development in customer experience for the airline.

'We're delighted to give Qantas customers the freedom and flexibility to use their personal electronic devices from the moment they board the plane until they disembark,' said Mr Strambi.

'Whether customers choose to listen to music, read their e-books or review work documents the introduction of gate-to-gate electronic access on Qantas flights is an exciting development to an already exceptional inflight entertainment service.

Qantas was the first Australian airline to introduce Inflight Entertainment and provide wireless devices on board

'Qantas was the first Australian airline to introduce Inflight Entertainment and provide wireless devices on board so it's great to be able to capitalise on these features for our customers.

'Qantas has conducted rigorous testing to assess the impacts of electronic devices on the safe operation of aircraft. We are confident that these devices are safe to be turned on, but in flight mode, for the duration of each flight.'Â 

Until August this year, devices in Australia were required to remain off until the seatbelt sign turned off, meaning passengers were unable to use them while the aircraft was taxiing to the runway or through much of the climb or descent.
