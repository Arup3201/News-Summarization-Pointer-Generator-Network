Robin van Persie has revealed his disappointment at Manchester United's poor start to the Premier League campaign and has called on his team-mates to show their true quality.

Manchester United have picked up just one point in their opening two games of the season against Swansea City and Sunderland - leaving Van Persie frustrated.

However the Dutchman, who said he felt 'good' after playing his first game since Holland's third-place play-off match against Brazil, believes Louis van Gaal's side will regain their form in the next few weeks.

Van Persie, speaking to MUTV after Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Sunderland, said: 'We dropped two points on Sunday. Clearly we came here to win, and if you go in front after 15 minutes or so, we should have at least held on to that for longer.

'We were a bit too sloppy in possession, and in that sense we made it too hard for ourselves.

'We’ve played two games and only picked up one point, we would have loved to have got six points but it didn’t happen, so we have to bounce back.'

Public backing: Van Persie was full of praise for Louis van Gaal after Man United's draw with Sunderland

And Van Persie has backed compatriot Van Gaal to turn Manchester United into a major Premier League force once again.

'I think that everyone has faith and everyone believes in the staff and players. We have great players, and it’s just a matter of time before the points will start coming in.

'I worked with Van Gaal for two years, and he’s very clear.

'He’s clear in what he asks of each player in the team every day. So, where I can, I will help the other players.'
