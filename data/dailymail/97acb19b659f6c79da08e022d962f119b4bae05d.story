Russia yesterday promised to retaliate if its interests are attacked as Ukraine’s leaders relaunched their ‘anti-terror’ offensive and threatened to ‘liquidate’ armed pro-Russian rebels.

With tensions rising and the much-heralded Geneva peace deal in tatters, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Vitaly Yarema said security agencies would target Moscow’s supporters in key eastern cities, driving them from buildings they have occupied for several weeks.

He said: ‘Security agencies are working to liquidate all the groups operating in Kramatorsk, Slovyansk and the other towns in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.’

Combat mode: A masked pro-Russian separatist stands guard outside the security service building seized by the rebels in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slaviansk as Kiev declared it would 'liquidate' the insurgents

Insurgency: Pro-Russian armed activists patrol near an armoured vehicle in front of the captured office of Security service of Ukraine in Slaviansk

On guard: Pro-Kremlin rebels in Ukraine were braced for a renewed military offensive by Kiev as US troops headed to region in a show of force after Washington again warned Moscow over the escalating crisis

Tensions: In a rapid escalation of the rhetoric, Russia responded by threatening to invade at least one Ukrainian region if Kiev did halt its plan to take out the separatists

His declaration came after two men, including a pro-Kiev politician, Volodymyr Rybak, were said to have been tortured to death by pro-Russian forces near the flashpoint eastern city of Slaviansk.

A disturbing video showed Mr Rybak, a member of the Batkivshchyna party led by former premier Yulia Tymoshenko, surrounded by a mob before being manhandled by several men, including a masked man in camouflage, after he tried to remove the flag of the separatist Donetsk Republic.

He appears able to walk away following the intervention of a policeman but Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said he was seen later being bundled into a car.

His body was found hours later together with that of an unidentified man. They had been tortured and thrown in a river to drown.

Interim Ukrainian leader Oleskander Turchinov cited the deaths as a reason to relaunch the previously ineffective ‘anti-terror’ operation, saying: ‘Terrorists who have effectively taken the whole Donetsk region hostage, have crossed a line, starting to torture and murder Ukrainian patriots.’

Two Russian warplanes probed Nato airspace yesterday, prompting the RAF to scramble two Typhoon fighter jets to repel them.

As relations between Russia and the West cooled to their lowest levels since the Cold War, the huge Tu95 Bear bombers (below) strayed close to UK airspace off north-east Scotland yesterday afternoon.

The RAF’s elite ‘Quick Reaction Alert’ force based at RAF Leuchars in Fife, in Scotland, shadowed the Russian planes for hundreds of miles before the pilots turned for home.

The Typhoons, which are on 24-hour standby, were called into action as the Kremlin flexed its muscles to test Western response times. 

Last night it emerged the Royal Navy had also sent a heavily armed warship to track a Russian naval vessel as it approached British waters.

HMS Dragon, a Type 45 destroyer, tracked and intercepted the Vice Admiral Kulakov, a large destroyer, as it sailed past the UK. The Ministry of Defence said it was ‘keeping an eye’ on the Russian ship’s transit south.

He said Mr Rybak’s body carried the 
marks of ‘brutal torture’, adding: ‘These crimes are being carried out 
with the full support and indulgence of the Russian Federation.

'I call on the security agencies to relaunch and carry out effective anti-terrorist measures, with the aim of protecting Ukrainian citizens living in eastern Ukraine from terrorists.’

It brought an immediate rebuke from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Moscow will respond if its interests in Ukraine are attacked.

Last night Ukraine said it had flushed armed separatists out of a town in eastern Ukraine as part of the ‘anti-terrorism’ operation.

It said the operation took place on the outskirts of Sviatogorsk and that no one was injured.

‘Russian citizens being attacked is an attack against the Russian Federation,’ Mr Lavrov said.

He accused the US of ‘running the show’ in Ukraine and claimed it was ‘quite telling’ that Kiev had relaunched its ‘anti-terrorist’ operation during a visit by US vice-president Joe Biden.

Mr Yarema, speaking a day after meeting Mr Biden, said: ‘We have obtained the support of the United States, that they will not leave us alone with an aggressor.

We hope that in the event of Russian aggression this help will be more substantive.’

Poland prime minister Donald Tusk warned: ‘The risk that eastern regions of Ukraine will become detached is real.

'I am afraid we will not have to wait long before we see more acts of the Ukrainian drama.’

Russian gas giant Gazprom has said it will turn off supplies to Ukraine next month unless Kiev pays its debts.

That would have a knock-on effect on deliveries to Europe, because much of the gas passes through Ukrainian territory.

Sorrow: A pro-Russia Ukrainian woman cries during the funeral of the three pro-Russia gunmen killed last Sunday at a checkpoint in Slaviansk. The tension has lasted several weeks in eastern Ukraine and led to deaths

Grief: A pro-Russia Ukrainian woman places flowers on the body of Pavel Pavelco, 42, a pro Russia militiaman

Tributes: People lay flowers during the funeral ceremony of men killed on Easter Sunday

Emotion: Mourners gather around the open caskets of the three men as they pay their respects
