How many sofas can you fit in the back of a tiny Skoda? None - as this family eventually found out.

This hilarious video shows a determined trio trying to shoehorn a huge sofa into the back of their mid-90s Skoda.

The hapless attempts, which went on for more than three minutes, saw the family flip the sofa into several different positions, before repeatedly ramming the furniture into the boot.

How many three-seater sofas can you fit into a tiny Skoda? This family has gone viral trying to figure out the answer to that question

The three family members were seen trying to negotiate the sofa into the back of their mid-90s Skoda - but appeared to have a lot of difficulty

No matter what angle they tried, the sofa just didn't want to squeeze into the back of the car

The hilarious footage - which has gone viral - was filmed by Graeme Longden, who saw the scene 
unfold as he peered out of his bedroom window in Sheffield

At one point during the hopeless attempt, one of the group even removed the cushions from the sofa - but it didn't make the blindest bit of difference.

The footage was filmed by Graeme Longden, 44, who recorded the scene from his bedroom window in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

After filming for a few minutes, he raced downstairs to try and get a closer look.

But, by the time he got downstairs, the family - consisting of two women, the driver and two children - had gone.

He said: 'I can only think that they drove off with the sofa wedged in the back.'

Mr Longden posted the clip on Facebook and, within days, it went viral. It now has more than 62,000 shares.

After several failed attempts, one of the group had a brainwave - to remove the cushions from the sofa

But, unsurprisingly, the giant piece of furniture still would not squeeze into the miniature car

Flipping the sofa upside down - for about the twelfth time - didn't help the problem, either

Mr Longden raised downstairs to try and get a closer look, but they had driven off by the time he got there. He said: 'I can only think they drove off with the sofa wedged in the back'

He said: 'It’s just crazy how many people have seen it. On Sunday my neighbours put the sofa on their drive and on Monday afternoon I saw these people trying to put it in the car.

'I
 thought there is no was they are going to get that in, so I started 
filming. I had to stifle my laughter as I watched them trying to wedge 
it in.

'I filmed for a few minutes and then I thought I’m going to go downstairs and keep filming. At this point they had wedged the sofa in the back of car.

'There were two women, two children and the driver who had all driven up together, so it was a pretty full car already.

'It probably went on for about five minutes and by the time I had rushed down the stairs to carry on filming they had gone.

'I just can’t believe how many people have seen it. But it is really funny.'
