Brian Flynn, the manager Blackpool almost appointed at the beginning of the summer, was present at Bloomfield Road during the side's 1-0 defeat by Burnley on Saturday.

Flynn was spotted making notes and taking in the action from a seat in the West Stand, sparking suggestions that he may be in line for a senior with Blackpool.

When approached by Sportsmail, Flynn insisted he was 'just watching' and denied that he has any involvement with Blackpool or indeed any other club.

Coincidence? Former Doncaster Rovers manager Brian Flynn was watching Blackpool on Saturday

Not happy! Blackpool fans protested about the Oyston family's stewardship before defeat against Burnley

However, a senior Blackpool member of staff later told Sportsmail that Flynn was there in a scouting capacity at the request of Hull City. The Humberside club were not available for comment on Saturday evening.

Former Doncaster Rovers manager Flynn was nearly handed the main job by chairman Karl Oyston in May before a last-minute change of heart over the make-up of his proposed backroom staff and fear of a fans' backlash.

Jose Riga was handed the reins but with Blackpool having only 13 registered players on there books, tensions remain high between the Belgian and the chairman with only a week to go before the Championship season begins.

First choice? Jose Riga was handed the Blackpool job, but they were heavily interested in Flynn
