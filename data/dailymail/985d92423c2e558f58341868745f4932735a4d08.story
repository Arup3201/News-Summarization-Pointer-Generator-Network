Shock: Max Taylor, the son of the Governor of the Cayman Islands says finding out he was a father was a shock he was not ready for

When distinguished diplomat Duncan Taylor became the Governor of the Cayman Islands, he promised that his family would strive to get to know the locals.

Two years later his 25-year-old son Max has rather exceeded those expectations by fathering a child after a brief liaison with the daughter of a prominent local businessman.

Their daughter, Serenity, was born seven months ago.

However, the relationship between Max, a £7-an-hour hotel swimming pool attendant, and the baby’s mother, Sophia Rankin, has grown increasingly rancorous and now threatens to set tongues wagging in this slow-moving British overseas territory and tax haven.

Yesterday, as he stood on the steps of the imposing white-washed Government House, where he lives with his parents, Max said he felt ‘intimidated’ by Ms Rankin.

He claimed she had been making threatening late-night phone calls, accusing him of shirking his responsibilities. ‘I hope it doesn’t cause trouble for my father,’ he said. 

‘The last year has been the worst of my life. I wasn’t ready to be a father and I am not with the mother.

‘What happened – the pregnancy – was an accident. It wasn’t planned and was a shock.’

It must also have been a shock for the 
Governor, who was honoured by the Queen with a CBE for his work at the 
British Consulate in New York in the aftermath of the attacks on 
September 11.

His family has a long record of public service. His father, Sir Jock, was ambassador to West Germany while his grandfather,  Sir John, capped his 50-year diplomatic career as ambassador to  Mexico in the Fifties.

Duncan Taylor, 53, helps his son by contributing to monthly child-support payments and has seen Serenity on a ‘few occasions’.

Max, who works at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, said: ‘I do not earn a lot of money and so my father helps out. We pay what we think is a fair amount.

'I am not aware of any problems but there is not really a good relationship with the mother.

‘My father gets on well with Sophia’s father, but she has been very intimidating and calling me in the early hours of the morning and sending me texts.

‘She has been quite threatening, even though I am doing all I can to support our daughter. I have seen Serenity two or three times, but hopefully that will increase.’

The Governor’s mansion is set in an acre of manicured lawns on the edge of Grand Cayman’s Seven Mile Beach, a stunning stretch of white sand that has been voted the best beach in the Caribbean.

Its grand foyer is dominated by a painting of the Queen. An antique table at the entrance is covered with photographs of dignitaries who have visited in recent years, including Prince Andrew, Tony Blair and the Duke of Kent.

The residence is on the opposite side of the island from where Ms Rankin, 28, an accountant, lives with her parents, Kent and Ella, in a modern red-brick house in the  Bodden Town area.

Ms Rankin became pregnant after she met Max at a New Year’s Eve Party in 2010. Friends said they were not dating and the pregnancy was a ‘shock’ to both.

Ms Rankin said Max was not present at the birth and had not been involved with bringing up their daughter. 

But she insisted he was able to see Serenity whenever he wanted. ‘He has seen her a few times and any time he wants to see her again he can call,’ she said.

‘Max and I are not together. It never worked out between us and he does not live with me and the baby.

'I have not seen him for some time, but all he has to do is call, although I have a very busy schedule. I am working as an accountant so am away from home during the day.

‘I would say I have a very good relationship with the Taylors and they have a good relationship with the baby. There is no animosity.’

Ms Rankin said if she needed money to help buy clothes she just had to ask the Taylor family. ‘They have said that anything I need I should buy. Max is supporting his child,’ she said.

She would not talk about her father’s relationship with Governor Taylor or what he thought about Max.

Mr Rankin owns numerous properties on Grand Cayman, including a shopping centre and three restaurants as well as the local radio station.

Earlier this year he was made a Commander of the Cayman Islands for his contribution to Grand Cayman.

Mr Rankin, who is also known by his nickname ‘Biggie’, declined to talk about his daughter and the Governor’s son when contacted.

Mr Taylor is halfway through a four-year posting as the 11th Cayman Islands Governor.

In a statement to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘While my son and the child’s mother are no longer partners, he is helping to support the child. We are in close contact with the Rankin family.

‘We are delighted to have a wonderful and beautiful granddaughter and enjoy spending time with her tremendously. She brings joy to both our families.’

A Foreign Office spokesman added that it was untrue that there was any animosity between the families.
