It is the latest way that knitters are decorating something dowdy with a colorful twist.

The knitwear craze known as yarn bombing has hit the 'ugly statues' of Portland, Oregon.

Visitors to  Oregon’s Pioneer Courthouse Square, now through December 25, 2014, will be greeted with the sight of the surrounding area’s iconic statues looking a little more festive.

Festive: The festive knitwear is a timely attraction ahead of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays

Duck: This duck statue has been covered in a knitted blue sweater and is a part of the yarn bombing exhibit

The fashion-forward statues are all decked in fabulous holiday sweaters. 

And this year, they will undergo a wardrobe change every Thursday until Christmas Day.

The makeover is the brainchild of local fiber artists who knit and crocheted the outfits in bold colors.

Portland Mayor Charlie Hales unveiled the yarn bombing on November 13.

Last year, a similar local installation was stolen shortly after it was put up.
