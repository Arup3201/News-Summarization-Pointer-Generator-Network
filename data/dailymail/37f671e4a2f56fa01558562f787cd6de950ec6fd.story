Mobile network Three has kicked off a price war over the new 4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at no extra cost.

The firm’s 1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet from £15 a month.

Experts said the move will put pressure on rivals EE, Vodafone and O2, which have been counting on charging more for 4G.

The 4G system allows smartphones, tablets and laptops to surf the web five times faster than at present. Users can download a song in four seconds or post a photograph to a social networking site in six seconds.

They can stream – watch straight from the internet – movies, videos and television as easily and quickly as with a home computer.

The Three deal will start in mid December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales.

EE was first to launch 4G in the UK last October. It added a premium of £5 a month,  or £60 a year.

The company made a series of price cuts this summer ahead of 4G launches by Vodafone, O2 and Three. It also said it would dramatically increase 4G speeds.

Ernest Doku, a telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: ‘Three has really put the cat amongst the pigeons by simply offering 4G for no extra cost.

‘With all the big players now ready and raring to offer superfast mobile internet – and Three soon to change the game by giving it away – it won’t be long before competition heats up on all fronts.’

However, he pointed out that Three’s 4G will only be available in a few cities at first, while EE’s service covers 100. All 4G customers also need a compatible handset, which can cost up to £450.

A Three spokesman said: ‘All customers with a 4G-ready device will be able to benefit from 4G at no extra cost with a simple software upgrade, so no need to go into a store.’

Three’s 4G service will start in London, Birmingham and Manchester in December.

While mobile networks have spent billions on 4G licences, masts and technology, the operating costs for 4G are actually lower than for 3G. More data can be squeezed into a smaller slice of airwaves, making it cheaper to transmit vast amounts of information.
