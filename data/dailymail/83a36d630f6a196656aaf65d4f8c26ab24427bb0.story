In the mind: Researchers say 'brain integration' is the secret to becoming highly skilled

Practice doesn’t make perfect – but meditation might.

Researchers say that however hard some people try, they will not excel at their  chosen skill. That is because the key to  perfection is in the mind, say the scientists, who claim that people who rise to the top have more ‘highly integrated’ brains.

A team led by Dr Fred Travis, a neuroscientist and advocate of Transcendental Meditation at the Maharishi University of Management in Iowa, sought to discover the secret of success.

He said the key is a high level of ‘brain integration’, which means connections between various regions of the brain are strong.

'It’s a simple fact that some people stand out, and we’re trying to tease out why,' said lead researcher Dr Fred Travis, from the Maharishi University of Management in the U.S.

'While there’s a common notion that 10,000 hours of practice is necessary for high achievement, some people put in long hours and do not excel.

'This work.. suggests that brain integration may be the inner factor that leads to outer success.'

Dr Travis studied 21 Swedish product development engineers, a group expected to display high levels of creativity.

His team found a strong correlation between higher flexibility and originality in creativity tests, and higher levels of brain integration, faster decision making, and a sense of being in control.

Peace: An author of the study said the brain working in harmony is pivotal to creativity

Co-author Dr Yvonne Lagrosen, from University West in Sweden, said: 'Our empirical findings highlight that creativity, in the form of flexibility and originality, is connected to whole brain functioning and psychological development.

'Since creativity is highly important for individual success, optimising brain functioning should be a priority for every student.'

Previous research has shown greater brain integration in world-class athletes, top managers and professional musicians, said Dr Travis, whose findings appear in the Creativity Research Journal.
