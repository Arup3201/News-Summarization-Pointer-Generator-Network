The middle-aged son of actress Kate O’Mara was found dead in a garage on New Year’s Eve, it emerged last night.

Dickon Young, 48, was discovered by a neighbour at around 3.40pm in the village where the former set designer lived with his mother, now 73.

Last night, residents in Long Marston, near Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, told how he had suffered mental health problems following a car crash some years ago.

The mother and son had lived in the village – famous for its airfield which plays host to summer music festivals – for around a year.

It is understood a next-door neighbour discovered Dickon’s body on Monday afternoon, although it remained unclear last night who owned the garage where he was found.

David Marcuse, a warden at the village’s St James Church, said: ‘I don’t think Dickon was very well.

‘He had a car accident some years ago and his mind was never the same, as I understand it. I think he suffered from periods of depression.

‘Physically he seemed fine. He didn’t leave the house very often, but I used to see him occasionally walking through the village.

‘It is a tragic situation all round and everybody’s thoughts will be with the family.’

One villager, who did not want to be named, said: 'Kate has not been well herself recently but I am told that she is, quite understandably, beyond distraught by Dickon's death.

'Police were called and he was found with a rope around his neck. The family are considering it a suicide.

'They [Kate and Dickon] were very close and she doted on him, especially since he suffered what appeared to be something of a mental breakdown in recent years.

'Despite only living here a relatively short time, Kate has become a genuinely well-liked member of the community and we are all deeply saddened by her loss.'

Twice-divorced Miss O’Mara moved to the property with her son around a year ago.

She remains best known for her role as Caress Morell, the scheming sister of Joan Collins’ Alexis Colby in Dynasty, but has also starred in a number of hit TV shows including Doctor Who, Howards’ Way and Absolutely Fabulous, as well as establishing her own theatre company.

Last spring, she starred in the Agatha Christie Theatre Company’s production of Murder on the Nile at the Malvern Theatre in Worcestershire.

In the mid-1980s, at the age of 22 while working in a London theatre, Dickon enjoyed a well-publicised affair with actress Jenny Agutter, who was ten years his senior.

He
had worked as a stage manager, rigger and carpenter at the Royal 
Shakespeare Company, and ran his own set-building company in Los 
Angeles, specialising in suspended scenery, before settling up his own 
company building treehouses in the mid-1990s.

By
2002, Dickon was once more involved in the theatre, working as a set 
designer on his mother’s company’s production of The Rivals at 
Birmingham’s Alexandra Theatre. The production featured Miss O’Mara in a
supporting role.

Dickon, whose father is the actor Jeremy Young, is not thought to have been working recently.

Following their divorce, Miss O’Mara gave birth to another son, but when his father left, she made the agonising decision to have the child adopted. The boy, Chris Linde, contacted her decades later but the pair did not get on.

He later branded Miss O’Mara an ‘uncaring mother’ in a series of bitter attacks in the Press.

Miss O’Mara married second husband, Richard Willis, in 1993. They divorced three years later.

Last night a woman answering the door at the actress’s cottage on the edge of Long Marston said of the tragedy: ‘It is a difficult time for us’, but declined to comment further.

A Warwickshire police spokesman said the death was not being treated as suspicious.
