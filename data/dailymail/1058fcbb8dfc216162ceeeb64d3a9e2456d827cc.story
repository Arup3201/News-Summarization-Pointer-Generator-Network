It was the first thing they did on arrival at the hotel. To a man, the American team stepped forward to embrace the valued colleague whose very presence here may just represent the greatest triumph of the whole Ryder Cup week. 

Lance Bennett, caddie to Matt Kuchar, is back at work less than a month after the sudden death of his 39-year-old wife, Angela. 

It means a lot to Bennett, clearly, to be among friends. And it means everything to Kuchar to have his old friend back on the bag this week.

‘It’s been great,’ said Kuchar. ‘Lance didn’t come on the team charter and so, once everybody arrived, he and a couple guys that came early greeted us as we arrived. Everybody went up, gave him a big hug, got to spend some time with him.

‘Most guys are happy to see him back to some sort of normality. We felt so bad for his situation. It’s great to have him back as part of the family. 

'We all felt like we lost a little something when we lost Angie. When she passed, we lost a bit of Lance, as well, so to have him back has been great.’ 

Kuchar explained that the nature of the Ryder Cup — a team event surrounded by friends — was probably a factor in Bennett’s decision to return to work so early.

‘I have one other friend that’s gone through a similar thing,’ said the 36-year-old. ‘He said, “There’s no rulebook in a situation like this. You make the decisions whenever you’re ready to do anything”. He shared those ideas with Lance.’ 

Kuchar’s warmth shines through even as he tackles the most complex subjects and it is not hard to see why he is one of the most popular members of the US team. 

Tiger Woods, who is not involved in this year’s tournament, was laughing last week as he said the only thing he would not miss about the Ryder Cup were Kuchar’s jokes. 

Kuchar, who is expected to partner 21-year-old Jordan Spieth on Friday, is playing in his third Ryder Cup, but that does not mean the experience is getting stale. 

He said: ‘The excitement, I don’t know if that’ll ever go away. A Ryder Cup is just so unique and I still feel every bit as excited to get going.’
