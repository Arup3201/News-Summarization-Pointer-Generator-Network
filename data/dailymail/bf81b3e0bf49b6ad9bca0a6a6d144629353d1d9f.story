Hospital records of every NHS patient have been sold to insurers, it has emerged.

A major UK insurance society claims it was able to access records of 47 million patients over 13 years to help it decide premiums for customers.

The Staple Inn Actuarial Society said in a report that it used NHS data covering all hospital in-patient stays between  1997 and 2010 to track the medical histories of patients, identified by date of birth and postcode.

Concerns over use of patient data have been heightened after plans to roll out a new NHS data-sharing scheme were put on hold amid concerns over privacy and patients not being properly informed over the changes

The group – which works on behalf of insurance companies and actuaries – used the information to recommend an increase in the price of policies for  thousands of customers last year.

Concerns over use of patient data have been heightened in recent days after plans to roll out a new NHS data-sharing scheme were put on hold amid concerns over privacy and patients not being  properly informed over the changes.

The central database would involve taking records from GP practices and linking them with hospital records.

Those promoting the scheme insist that it would be illegal for information held in GP records to be sold to insurers.

The Staple Inn Actuarial Society report said it was able to combine hospital patient data with credit ratings agencies to advise companies, which led to increased premiums for most customers over the age of 50.

The society said it was able to better calculate forecasts for certain diseases, such as lung cancer.

GPs and privacy campaigners have strongly opposed the £50million scheme, claiming it would lead to patient data being misused

Phil Booth, from privacy campaign group medConfidential, told The Telegraph: ‘The language in the document is extraordinary; this isn’t about patients, this is about exploiting a market.

‘Of course any commercial organisation will focus on making a profit – the question is why is the NHS prepared to hand this data over?’

He added: ‘We have been categorically told that it would be illegal for GP data to be handed over to insurers, yet already all this hospital data has been extracted. It blows out of the water the idea that patients’ privacy is being protected.’

However, the new body in charge of NHS patient data said hospital episode statistics (HES) have not been used to analyse individual insurance premiums, but more generally, to analyse conditions among certain age groups.

A spokesman from the Health and Social Care Information Centre said the data did not identify individuals. ‘The newly formed HSCIC can now only provide HES data to organisations that are looking to improve the way they are run for the benefit of their patients,’ she said.

‘This data is completely protected and does not identify individuals.’

Last week Tim Kelsey, director for patients and information at NHS England, said it will be ‘a criminal offence’ for any information entered into the new giant database, which will combine GP and hospital records, to be sold for insurance purposes. However, a database which contains only hospital records remains a separate entity, with its own rules allowing greater access to third parties.

GPs and privacy campaigners have strongly opposed the £50million scheme, claiming it would lead to patient data being misused.

Last week officials announced the data-sharing plan would be delayed by six months to ensure that members of the public were first made aware what their details will be used for and how they can opt out.
