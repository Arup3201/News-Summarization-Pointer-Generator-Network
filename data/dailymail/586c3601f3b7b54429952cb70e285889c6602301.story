Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveils the first-generation iPod Nano: Now Apple says models released six years ago may have a battery malfunction - and is offering free, new replacements to owners

It's one of the oddest product recalls in some time.

Apple has warned that the batteries on the iPod Nano can catch fire - but only on the very oldest models.

One might imagine that a Nano that has stood the test of time since 2005-2006 when the first generation of the slim devices was on sale would be safe - but Apple thinks not.

The defect discovered in the batteries appears to get worse over time.

So much so, in fact, that the company is offering a replacement, new iPod Nano - a serious technological upgrade which adds a touchscreen, an FM radio and a pedometer to the rather basic Nano that late Apple CEO Steve Jobs launched six years ago.

All you have to do is remember where you put your six-year-old MP3 player.

It's not clear what incident sparked the current recal. There have been unconfirmed and highly isolated reports of batteries overheating around the world, including incidents where overheating batteries set fire to users' clothes. But it's not exactly an epidemic.

In a statement, the company said that,'Apple has determined that, in very rare cases, the battery in the iPod nano (1st generation) may overheat and pose a safety risk. Affected iPod nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006.'

'This issue has been traced to a single battery supplier that produced batteries with a manufacturing defect. While the possibility of an incident is rare, the likelihood increases as the battery ages.'

What you get: The replacement iPod Nano is a new model that can clip to a watch strap, and also features a colour touchscreen, FM radio and pedometer

'Apple recommends that you stop using your iPod nano (1st gen) and follow the process noted below to order a replacement unit, free of charge.'

Apple says serial numbers will be checked to ensure the units are affected - you can check via their website.

Replacements will be issued within six weeks.
