More senior bank bosses are to face hefty fines if they fail to prevent wrongdoing under a crackdown on City failure by the Bank of England.

New rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to 'run their firms responsibly'.

But there are concerns the move could deter the best people from rising through the ranks, fearing being held to account for problems on their watch.

New rules to hold senior figures to account when things go wrong are to be extended to also cover non-executive directors to force them to 'run their firms responsibly'

The Bank of England is strengthening rules covering senior bankers, known as the Senior Persons Regime.

It includes the threat of a lifetime ban, large fines and the power to jail bankers for reckless misconduct.

Sanctions will be imposed if a senior manager responsible for an area where a breach of the rules occurred 'cannot demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to avoid or stop it'.

In addition to bank chairmen, it will cover senior independent directors, and the heads of risk, audit and remuneration committees.

There is also a new criminal offence which could see senior managers held liable for reckless decisions leading to the failure of a bank.

The tougher rules were drawn up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and scandals including bank mis-selling and rigging lending rates.

Andrew Bailey, deputy governor and head of the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority, said: 'Senior managers will be held individually accountable if the areas they are responsible for fail to meet our requirements.

'Our new accountability regime will hold all senior managers, including non-executive directors, to a clear standard of behaviour and we will take action where they fail to meet this.'

In an article in the Financial Times he stressed that expanding the scope of the rules was the right way to ensure that those responsible for the running of financial institutions are held to account.

He said: 'Organisations need to make sure they have on the board people with the right skills, who are prepared to dedicate an appropriate amount of time to this vital role.

'It is not our intention that non-executives should take on executive roles, which would compromise their independence as a result of these regulatory changes.'

Andrew Bailey, the head of the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority, said senior managers must be individually accountable

He insisted that the new criminal offence will only be used 'in the most egregious cases', adding: 'We do not seek to collect scalps. Success will be well-governed firms, where senior managers know what is expected and run their firms responsibly.'

However the threat of the new rules sparked claims that senior bankers would resign.

Last year HSBC was forced to deny that the threat of jail led to at least one resignation from its board.

Tony Woodcock, a partner at law firm Stephenson Harwood, said widening the rules to cover non-executive directors would mean banks will 'will lose some good people, and perhaps take on some of the B team instead'.

He told the FT: 'Their liability is greater than ever, not least because of the reversal of the burden of proof. Fines are likely to be significantly higher than before as the regulators seek to make examples at the top of the industry. Who needs that at the end of their careers?'
