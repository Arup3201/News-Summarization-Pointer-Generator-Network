Wife beater: Paul Gonzalez has been sentenced to 15 years in jail for the savage beating of his ex-wife

A former Marine who savagely beat his wife in front of a judge after he was ordered to pay child maintenance at a divorce hearing has received the maximum sentence of 15 years behind bars.

Paul Gonzalez, 29, had to be subdued by a Taser when he flew into a rage at Catherine Scott, who suffered a broken nose, a fractured jaw, concussion and severe bruising to her face.

At the sentencing on Friday, Judge Geoffrey Cohen ignored Gonzalez's apologies, branding his actions in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida hearing 'an outrage'.

'It was in a court of law where people
 for hundreds of years have been coming to peaceably resolve their 
disputes where people have an expectation of safety — certainly where 
your former wife thought she would be safe,' Cohen said.

'You chose it 
as a place to viciously assault her.'

In February, Gonzalez pleaded 'no contest' to charges of beating his ex-wife in April 2011.

The couple, who married in 2006, had been discussing their divorce when Gonzalez flew into a rage and ran out of the chambers.

He stormed back in, screamed that he 
was not going to obey orders, grabbed his 23-year-old wife by the neck 
and began pummeling the side of her face with his closed fists, 
according to his arrest report.

He knocked her unconscious with
 the first blow but continued to punch her, and bailiffs had to Taser him twice to subdue him.

Scott, also a former marine, collapsed in a court clerk's arms as a pool of blood
 slowly formed by the the judge's chair at his chambers.

Victim: Catherine Scott, 23, was left with concussion, a broken nose, a fractured jaw and severe bruising

She was rushed to hospital, where she was 
kept in intensive care overnight while doctors monitored her for brain 
trauma.

According to authorities, he became angry when Judge Ronald Rothschild ordered him to pay child support for their two young children, then aged one and three.

'I woke up and I didn't know where I was,' Scott said in an interview after the attack. 'I didn't know where I was. I didn't know what was going on. I had just been hit that hard.'

Scott told the court she had been so badly beaten her children were scared of her.

'I couldn’t even go pick up my children 
from day care because there were complaints I was frightening the other 
children,' Scott said, CBS reported.

In court: Gonzalez apologised to his former wife in court. A psychiatric expert for the defense said he suffers from personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and bi-polar disorder

She added that she remains 'constantly on edge' after the beating and abuse that had been going on for years.

'No matter how long Mr. Gonzalez is contained behind bars, I will never feel safe from him,' she told the court.

She added: 'He advised me that he was going to take the children and that I would never see them again, and that it was his plan to make my life a living hell.'

A psychiatric expert for the defense told the judge Gonzalez suffers from 
personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and bi-polar 
disorder.

Gonzalez’s sister added that before the beating she had contemplated having her brother committed because he had threatened to kill himself.

Now: Scott told the court she still lives in fear of Gonzalez, who she said abused her for years before the attack

Then: After the beating, Scott could not collect her children from school as their friends were scared of her

Gonzalez spoke to the judge to admit he had failed, and to apologise to his ex-wife.

'I can't deny that it was me April 15 who took these two hands and put them on my former wife,' he said. 'And I know she said she wouldn't accept any apology, but what can I say? I'm sorry.'

He went on: 'I hurt 
the woman I said I loved and I am sorry and I hope that one day she does
 forgive me. I disappointed her. I was not a 
good husband. I wasn’t a good best friend.

'I destroyed any chance I had of ever doing what it was that I’ve always wanted to do — and that’s be a father, have a family and a loving wife. Be a loving husband.'

Ignoring the defense's plea for the minimum term of four years and three months, Judge Cohen handed Gonzalez a 15-year jail sentence and apologized to Scott.

Remorse: Gonzalez's attorney said he was fearful his client would not get the help he needs in prison

He asked why a family court judge had denied her a restraining order prior to the beating and why there had not been an armed sheriff’s deputy present during the contentious divorce hearing.

'Under very emotional circumstances the fact that there was no security in place, frankly, is inexcusable,' Judge Cohen said, according to NBC.

But Gonzalez's attorney said he fears his client will not get the help he needs in prison.

'He’s a young man who has some serious mental health illnesses that need to be addressed and by sentencing him to the maximum sentence surely will not help that,' said attorney Dawn Swickle.

Following the attack, Scott's lawyer Michael Dunleavy told the Florida Sun-Sentinel the alleged attack was 'surreal'.

He said: 'He was punching with a true vengeance. It was vicious. He was in a rage.'
