Computer controlled convoys of up to ten lorries could soon be driving along Britain's motorways in a bid to reduce the number of people killed in collisions with freight vehicles and cut fuel emissions.

The Department for Transport is to consider introducing the automated 'platoons' with a lead vehicle communicating with following trucks via Wifi.

The system, which was tested on a motorway in Sweden last week, could be trialled on UK roads as early as December.

A DfT fact finding team, led by chief engineer Bernie Frost, has been sent to Sweden to monitor the tests.

But while the Swedish trials are said to have gone well, the AA has raised concerns that the system could 'confuse and intimidate' drivers on Britain's busy motorways.

There are also fears that the computerised technology could be vulnerable to computer hackers.

Scientists from lorry manufacturer Scania claim that emissions would be lowered by as much as 10 per cent if the system was used and fuel costs would be reduced.

Warning: The AA is concerned that Britain's roads are too small and too busy for the system to work

They claim that it could also ease traffic with reduced gaps between vehicles in the convoys allowing for more traffic on the roads.

The firm is hoping to persuade European Governments to alter the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic to permit automated driving on the roads.

Gunnar Tornmalm from Scania told The Times: 'Technology is safer than drivers, particularly in bad weather.'

But president of the AA, Edmund King, says that while the system may be useful on deserted roads in other countries, Britain's roads are too small and too busy for it to work effectively.

He told The Times: 'There would be obvious dangers of long platoons blocking road sign, obstructing cars getting on and off the motorway and intimidating some drivers.'

The DfT however, claims that the convoy system could have 'huge benefits' if implemented on UK roads.

The system is effectively controlled by a lead vehicle which sets the following distance and speed.

Although drivers in following trucks control steering, the system automatically controls accelerating and braking.

The position of each lorry is monitored using cameras and the close formation of the vehicles reduces drag, therefore improving fuel efficiency.

Europe's freight haulage is responsible for 10 per cent of the 35,000 deaths on European roads every year.
