Rescuers trying to salvage a submerged 'little ship' that was used in the Dunkirk landings were fearful today after the operation ran into problems.

Some 600 stranded Allied soldiers were evacuated from France on board the Skylark XI during Operation Dynamo in 1940.

But for the last two years, the vessel has been lying on the bed of the River Leven at Balloch, West Dunbartonshire.

Submerged: A mission to rescue Skylark XI from the River Leven in Scotland has run into problems

A team of Royal Navy divers has spent two days trying to raise the boat, but the mission suffered a significant setback today.

A water pump broke as the Skylark was being lifted, causing it to start sinking again.

Dougie McCann, of the Leven Cruising Club, who organised the rescue, said: 'I’m absolutely gutted.

'We’ve
 been working on this project since March and every time we think we are
 getting somewhere, something goes wrong. It’s game over, I’m afraid.

'She has played her part in history and deserves a happy ending - not rotting at the bottom of a river.

'The boat is an important piece of British military and naval history and should not be allowed to just sink without trace. But it’s proved impossible to raise her.'

The Royal Navy experts, based at Faslane on the Clyde, were using special buoyancy bags in an attempt to lift the vessel.

Mr McCann said: 'We don’t know what’s going to happen now. There’s nothing more we can do without funding.'

The Skylark was among the smallest of the 'little ships' flotilla from 1940 which responded to the urgent call from Winston Churchill to rescue the Allied forces.

Her capacity was officially 90 passengers, but it managed to make four cross-Channel return trips carrying 150 exhausted and wounded soldiers each time.

The 50-foot vessel was built in 1927 as a pleasure cruiser in Poole, Dorset. It then spent years ferrying trippers around Brighton harbour.

The boat was commandeered after war was declared and it became a shallow water minesweeper.

It was also used to place anti-invasion obstacles around Poole harbour.

After the war, the vessel changed hands several times, moving gradually north before settling on Loch Lomond.

Operation Dynamo: Troops wade out to ships waiting to rescue them off the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940

Sweeney’s Cruises bought the boat in 1972 and began operating it as a pleasure cruiser on the loch.

The Skylark played a central role in annual ceremonies of the Glasgow and West of Scotland branch of the Dunkirk Veterans’ Association.

But it foundered at its moorings and became submerged in 2010 - only two days after the 70th anniversary of the evacuation.

Before the rescue operation began, Mr McCann said: 'I was on the point of giving up and having her broken up because I couldn’t get any help in saving her.

'We put her on eBay for £1 to no avail. After that, Boyd Tunnock of the famous teacake company rang and offered to help us.

'Luckily we’ve been donated the air bags and the Royal Navy have volunteered their services free, so we haven’t yet needed Mr Tunnock’s help.'

Hailed by Winston Churchill as a 'miracle of deliverance', the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk is one of the best-known episodes of the Second World War.

After British, French and Belgian troops became cut off by the advancing German army, some 850 ships sailed to France to rescue them.

They included the 'famous little ships of Dunkirk', a flotilla of about 700 merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft and lifeboats.

Between May 27 and June 4, 1940, more than 338,000 soldiers were rescued, including almost 200,000 British troops.

The mission, codenamed Operation Dynamo, incurred significant losses, however, and Churchill warned afterwards: 'Wars are not won by evacuations'.

The British premier said there was not doubt in his mind that the Allied operations in Western Europe prior to the evacuation had been a 'colossal military disaster'.

Nine Allied destroyers - six British and three French - were sunk during Operation Dynamo, and more than 100 RAF aircraft were lost in the fighting.
