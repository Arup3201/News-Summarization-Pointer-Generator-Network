She's one of Tinseltown's most famous - and photographed - superstars, but since that infamous lift scene, Beyonce has been laying low.

However, ahead of her joint tour On The Run with husband Jay Z, the pop star is slowly making her way back into the limelight.

Her first port of call? Posing in a steamy shoot to promote her new fragrance, Beyonce Heat Wild Orchid.

Turning up the heat! Superstar Beyonce, who has been keeping away from the limelight lately, has just unveiled her new fragrance campaign for Heat Wild Orchid, which lands in stores in August

Wearing a revealing feathered black dress slashed at the leg and chest, Beyonce, 32, shows off her svelte frame in the new imagery.

With her hair slicked back into a low bun and wearing natural make-up, Beyonce looks a million dollars promoting her £24.99 scent.

The fragrance, which lands in stores in August, describes itself as an 'enticing, mouth-watering fragrance that emits a fierce, feminine energy.'

Created in collaboration with Firmenich Perfumer Honorine Blanc, it combines the scents of pomegranate, coconut water and boysenberry.

Beyonce introduced her first fragrance, Heat, in 2010, followed by a collection of editions in the following years.

Her new fragrance campaign comes at the same time as news of weak ticket sales for her and Jay Z's On The Run tour.

The married hip-hop superstars will start their first co-headlining tour together on June 25 in Miami, Florida.

The
 couple's personal life got some negative exposure in May when Beyonce's
 sister Solange was caught on video attacking Jay Z in an elevator after
 a Met Gala afterparty.

remaining for their upcoming concert tour

The family drama combined with a lack of airplay may be contributing to lackluster sales, according to a report on Tuesday by RadarOnline.com.

A
 review of Ticketmaster found tens of thousands of tickets remained 
available for the tour launch in Miami as well as for concerts in 
Atlanta on July 15 and on July 12 in New Jersey.

'Beyonce's album had a big first month 
with Drunk In Love, but the last several singles have tanked on the 
charts,' an insider told RadarOnline.

'If you're launching a stadium tour, you have to have airplay, and she's had no hits lately on the radio,' the source added.

However, Beyonce,
 32, and Jay-Z, 44, have sold out a number of venues across the country 
and three additional shows were added in the US along with two in Paris 
due to popular demand.
