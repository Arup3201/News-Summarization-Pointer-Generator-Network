Jamie Donaldson emerges from a side door of his home in the Cheshire countryside cradling baby daughter Isla, as two-year-old son Max searches the kitchen for a tape measure to record the height of the breakfast bar.

If anyone can be presented as proof of the existence of the ‘nappy factor’ — a term introduced by betting guru Keith Elliott to suggest having babies, particularly boys, makes a better golfer — it is Donaldson.

‘It’s played a big part. I didn’t win a tournament until I had a child and now I’ve won three so I suppose I’d better have some more kids,’ he says. ‘I didn’t want them to grow up saying: “My dad was a professional golfer but he didn’t win any tournaments”.’

It was no coincidence, thinks Donaldson, that his breakthrough tour victory at the Irish Open in 2012, after trying for 12 years and 255 events, came just three months after Max’s birth.

On Thursday, Donaldson will tee it up in the Wales Open but next week he makes his debut for Europe in the Ryder Cup. His rise has been called a ‘Cinderella story’. Over the past five years he has advanced from a top-100 performer into one of Europe’s best, securing a place at Gleneagles by right. Not bad for a man who has been forced to contemplate ‘getting a proper job’ on several occasions due to a back injury he believes was caused by practising too much.

‘It got so bad I was scared of bending down to pick up my ball,’ says Donaldson. ‘If I trod on a pothole in the course I thought that would be it. Every other week I’d be having a problem, it was horrific, I thought I was finished.’

In 2006, he found himself plying his wares in the backwaters of the Challenge Tour. In stark contrast to the £2million he has earned this year in prize-money, Donaldson was scraping by.

‘I was in the wilderness,’ he says, ‘not really earning enough to keep myself, let alone a family. That was the biggest eye-opener for me. After two events on the Challenge Tour I was staring in the face getting a real job and I really didn’t like that prospect.

‘I was playing rubbish and stayed in terrible B&Bs, accommodation that wasn’t clean. But my attitude was that providing you’ve got a bed to sleep on and it’s not too cold, it didn’t matter. I don’t mind roughing it. When I was a kid we used to go to watch The Open and sleep in the back of a Ford Fiesta where it was Baltic at night just to see Seve Ballesteros or Nick Faldo play.’

We are sitting in a house — designed by Donaldson’s wife Kat, an international business and Spanish graduate — which overlooks rolling farmland. Smart but not flash, it is just outside the upmarket village of Prestbury. Michael Carrick lives round the corner, Wayne Rooney in the next village.

The material gains are clear to see but they have not come without hard work. Success on the biggest stage has come relatively late to Donaldson. At 38, he is the fourth oldest on Europe’s Ryder Cup team but one of only three who have not played in it before. ‘I still consider myself young in golfing terms because I started late,’ he says.

Where Tiger Woods was celebrated on the front of golf magazines at five and Rory McIlroy was hitting 40-yard drives aged two, Donaldson did not play properly until he was 12 and was arguably not even the best in his own family.

‘I have a bit of banter with my brother,’ says Donaldson. ‘He won the junior matchplay at our club in Macclesfield and I never did. I was bloody awful.

‘I’m a massive Liverpool fan and played football until I was 15 but decided I wanted to be a pro golfer and I’d practise until the cows came home. I’d hit down the fairways of the par-fiv. Members would hit their balls between yours and you’d have 100 balls in the same place. They hated it but I’d do it all day.

‘I used to practise on my own. When you leave school at 16 without qualifications you’d better like practising on your own because if you don’t, you’re toast.’

Donald was born in Pontypridd to a Welsh mother and Liverpudlian father, Jim, who acted as a taxi driver in the early days.

‘He’d drive me the length of the country to tournaments and lessons,’ says Donaldson. ‘He used to caddie for me but I sacked him. I duffed a chip and he said, “what you done that for?” and I said, “Dad, how far’s the clubhouse?” It was about a mile, so I said, “See you then”.’

It was hard to get Donaldson off the practice ground, but he is barely on it now and has not been to the gym since 2007. He stays fit by mountain and road biking.

‘My body feels as strong as it ever has,’ he says.

Occasionally, Donaldson thinks about what it will feel like to be on the first tee at Gleneagles. Darren Clarke said it is the most nervous you feel as a golfer.

‘The more nervous you are, the better you play sometimes,’ says Donaldson. ‘In the last round at the Irish Open I hit the best shot I ever had off the first tee and never looked back. It is a dream come true to play in the Ryder Cup, but there’s still plenty of fuel in the fire. I’m not thinking that’ll be me all out. I’m thinking it’s a stepping stone.’
