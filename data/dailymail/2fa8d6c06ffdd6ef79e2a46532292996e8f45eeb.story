Nebraskans wonder what could possibly be next after record low temps turn to record high temps in less than 72 hours.

Less than two weeks ago, it snowed in some parts of Nebraska and Iowa. And, on Sunday, the temperature in Omaha hovered at a teeth chattering 32 degrees.

That’s the lowest temperature ever recorded in Omaha on a May 12 day. The previous low of 33 degrees had remained unbroken for 135 years.

Strange: Spring tulips were sprinkled with snow in Omaha, Nebraska May 2. Some snow remained on May 12, when temperatures plummeted to 32 degrees, an all time record low

It was just barely edged out for the latest day the temperature ever reached freezing. The record latest date remains May 13, 1997.

Then, on Tuesday came a reprieve from the cold. But not everyone in the Cornhusker State was thankful.

With snow still remaining on the ground in some areas, the mercury soared.

Triple-digit temperatures shattered records for the early May day.

Spike: Two days later, temperatures spiked to record-breaking triple digits across the state. These early pool goers took advantage of a 101 degree day in Lincoln, Nebraska

It hit 100 before 3 p.m. Tuesday at Lincoln Airport, breaking the 1915 record of 96 degrees.

Officials say Tuesday's high was 101 in Omaha, 102 in Grand Island, and 103 in Norfolk.

In Tekamah, Nebraska, near the Iowa border, temperatures reached a blistering 108 degrees.

In Iowa, the high hit 106 in Sioux City, 102 in Carroll and 100 in Denison and Harlan.

The high of 96 in Waterloo, Iowa broke the record of 94 set in 1932.

The National Weather Service says the 94 in Des Moines broke the record of 93 set on May 14, 1988.

On Wednesday, the weather began to even out with a still hot, nowhere near yesterday’s freak heat, high of 83.

Unusual: Remnants of the May 2 snowstorm in the Midwest, seen here, could still be seen as Nebraskans wore shorts and sandals Tuesday. Wednesday's highs were in the 80s
