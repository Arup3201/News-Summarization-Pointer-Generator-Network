A TigerAir flight in Melbourne was evacuated on Friday night after a threat was made against the flight, sparking security concerns which police say have now been resolved.  

While police would not confirm the nature of the threat, which was made at approximately 9pm, TigerAir passengers took to social media to claim that there had been a bomb threat made against the budget airline.

'I'm on TigerAir flight 539. Announcement of POSSIBLE bomb threat at Melbourne airport made by flight crew,' tweeted passenger Scott Marquardt.

The threat  prompted passengers to be evacuated from the terminal as well as several planes to be grounded while Australian Federal Police and Victorian Police investigated the matter.

Mr Marquardt tweeted that the plane's crew announced they would be sitting on the tarmack for at least another hour. 

Tigerair Australia CEO Rob Sharp said that all necessary steps had been taken to implement precautionary measures and ensure passenger safety.

He thanked police for their thorough investigation of the threat. 

'TigerAir also apologises to affected passengers for the inconvenience and is doing everything possible to get them to their destinations as quickly as possible,' Mr Sharp said. 

The incident led to significant delays to terminal four of the airport, with further delays expected on Saturday.

Some have taken to social media to ask why the other terminals have not been impacted

Others have vented their frustration at the delays caused by the security scare

The security scare is still being investigated after being handed from AFP to Victoria Police.

An airport spokeswoman told ABC that other operations were continuing as normal. 

‘Officers and airport personnel are currently conducting a safety check on the area. No other other terminals have been affected,' an airport spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

Some have taken to social media to ask why the other terminals have not been impacted.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘If there was a legitimate bomb threat at Melbourne airport shouldn't they be evacuating every single terminal?’

Others have vented their frustration at the delays.

Another user tweeted: ‘There was a bomb threat at Melbourne airport and I have been sitting on the plane for 2 hours WAITING FOR THEM TO OPEN THE TERMINAL’
