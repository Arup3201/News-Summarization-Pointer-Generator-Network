Justice minister Damian Green has announced new rules forcing criminals to listen to statements read out by their victims in court

Murderers, rapists and other criminals will be forced to sit in court and listen to victims and their families describe the misery and heartache caused by their crimes.

Victims will be given the right to read out a statement in court after conviction - and confront directly the criminals who damaged their lives.

Justice minister Damian Green said it would mean both offenders and judges were ‘left in no doubt’ about the full suffering of those hurt by criminality.

If the victims choose to, they will read their statement out before sentencing, allowing the judge to take into account what they have said before setting a jail term or other sentence.

Currently, Victim Personal Statements are often handed over to the judge on paper, with extracts sometimes read to the court.

Nearly one in ten victims say they don’t remember even being offered the opportunity to write a statement. But as part of a new Victims’ Code, to be published today, they will be given a guarantee that their side can be heard before sentencing begins.

If they do not want to read it out themselves the prosecutor can do it for them.

Mr Green said: ‘For too long victims have felt they are treated as an afterthought in the criminal justice system. No more. I am determined that victims are given back their voice and are fully supported.

He added: ‘I want to create a tougher justice system. Under this government those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer. I’m making sure victims’ voices are heard and that criminals no longer get away with just a slap on the wrist.’

The new rules were welcomed by the family of Catherine Wells-Burr, a Bath Spa University graduate who was murdered by her Polish factory worker boyfriend in a plot with his secret lover and the lover’s uncle.

Rafal Nowak, 31, Anna Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, were convicted at Bristol Crown Court in June of murdering the 23-year-old for a life insurance payout and a share of a house worth £137,000.

Miss Wells-Burr’s mother Jayne, 46 submitted a statement to the court which was read by the judge.

She told the Mail: ‘I think every victim impact statement should be read out in court: it should be the right of the person whose life has been changed so badly.’

‘As witnesses you only answer the questions the barristers ask you, you can’t tell them your personal story.

‘In the statement, you can express your feelings about the person that you lost and your life without them.’

Catherine’s father Philip, 48, said: ‘We heard all the rubbish that came out from them for nine weeks.

‘At the end of it all victims should have their own right to express their feelings - and look those who did it in the eye.

Catherine’s sister Leanne, 22, added: ‘I think it’s important for statements to be read out. I wanted to have the last say to those defendants.’

Victims groups said the process of writing and reading out the statement can help victims cope and recover from the crime.

Earlier this year Michelle Knight, one of the victims of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro, confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity

Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said the change would give victims ‘the choice to explain to a court in their own words the personal and emotional impacts a crime has had on them and their families.’

The new code, which will come in to force in December, will ensure extra support for victims of stalking, domestic abuse, terrorism and families bereaved by violent crime.

It will explain what victims can expect from the criminal justice system from when they report a crime to the end of any trial, and make sure they are referred automatically to victims’ service by the police.

Victims will also be given easier access to compensation if they are denied support by the system.

And for the first time businessess - which are the victims of more than nine million crimes a year - will be given similar rights to individuals.

The new rules on reading out statements are similar to those in force in parts of the US. Earlier this year one of the victims of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity.

Michelle Knight told Castro: ‘You took 11 years of my life away, and now I have it back.’
