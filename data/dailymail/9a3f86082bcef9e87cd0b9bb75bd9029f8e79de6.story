The decomposing bodies of two infants or fetuses have been found stashed in an abandoned storage unit after its new owner reported a foul stench.

Regina Zimmer called deputies in Placer County, California in November after looking through the container at Sierra Self Storage when she won its contents at auction.

She said the bag of decomposing bodies was found inside an ottoman that was sealed with tape. Inside were numerous garbage bags filled with food, toys and other items.

'As soon as we removed all the tape, got the lid off, it smelt really, really bad,' she told KCRA. 'It was a little skull. It looked like it was in three pieces, some hair. And you could see a jawbone.'

Shock: Regina Zimmer found the remains of the babies in a storage unit she had just won at an auction. She said the bodies were in a bag stashed in an ottoman that had been sealed with tape

A deputy coroner later confirmed the remains were human. 

Investigators told the channel that the previous owner had defaulted on the rent for the storage unit and had not been there in months.

The bodies are believed to have been there for around six months, CBS reported.

'You just don't just throw your child - your baby - into a trash,' Zimmer said.

Sheriff's officials say detectives have interviewed a woman believed to be the mother - a 32-year-old woman. They are securing a search warrant for DNA tests and medical backgrounds.

They're now waiting for the results of forensic and toxicology tests before determining how to proceed.

They will need to determine whether or not the babies were alive when they were born, as well as a cause of death, before they consider pressing charges.

If the babies were alive at birth, the woman could face double-murder charges. The state allows healthy babies to be dropped off at locations, such as hospitals and fire stations. 

'We're trying to determine the age of the fetus, if it was a viable fetus or if it was a miscarriage, and then it's just the illegal dumping of human remains if that's the case,' said Lt. John Poretti.

'A lot of things are thing are waiting on toxicology reports because they were in such poor shape. a lot of things we can't tell if it was a viable fetus or not.'

The storage space is in the city of Colfax, about 40 miles northeast of Sacramento.
