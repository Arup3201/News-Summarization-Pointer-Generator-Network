When some people are bored, they twiddle their thumbs - but Kim Kardashian isn't one of them.

The 31-year-old reality star decided to tweet past sexy photos of herself when she found herself with nothing to do today.

She wrote on her Twitter page: 'I'm bored. Oh hiiiiii!' along with a recent photograph of herself.

Hello bored! Kim Kardashian tweeted this bondage style photo today while bored

'Oh hiiiii' was a frequent catchphrase as she posted photo after photo after photo.

She tweeted two photographs of herself as a blonde back in 2009.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star resembled Jennifer Lopez with her honey-toned highlights.

In one shot she poses in seductive bondage-style gear, while in another she didn't appear to be wearing any trousers.

It's hard not to admit that the star, who posted the caption 'Gluten free is the way to be' did look amazing in her stiletto boots and black bikini.

The now-brunette beauty also added a snap of herself with sister Kourtney.

She looked lovely in a royal blue jumpsuit, while her older sibling donned an embellished top.

Though bored, she doesn't look as upset as one might assume she should given that her lawyer believes ex-husband Kris Humphries is deliberately delaying their divorce proceedings.

Laura Wasser told a Los Angeles judge today that she believes the New Jersey Nets player's 'personal feelings and maybe some media drive is keeping the case alive.'

She added: 'Certainly they've been separated longer than they've been married.'
