An ex-con has been arrested in connection after one priest was murdered and another badly beaten last week at a Roman Catholic church in Phoenix, authorities said.

Gary Michael Moran, 54, was charged Monday with shooting to death Reverend Kenneth Walker, 28, and savagely beating Rev. Joseph Terra, 56, last Wednesday evening.

Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia called the crimes 'vicious, tragic and horrifying' during a Monday press conference, adding that the city as a whole was 'appalled two priests were attacked.'

Moran barged into the Mother of Mercy Mission rectory Wednesday and attacked both men just before 9.00 p.m., Garcia said. He shot Walker and beat Terra with a metal rod. Terra first tried to use the rod in self defense.

Walker was not originally in the rectory, but came down where he heard the commotion, according to Garcia. That's when he was shot.

Moran then fled the scene, but investigators were able to match forensic evidence to him. No motive has been established, but investigators believe it was a robbery gone wrong.

He didn’t go into why he did it, but he did talk to us about being there, the struggle that ensued, and then he invoked his rights [to an attorney],' Garcia explained.

Moran was released from prison April 24 
after serving about eight years on charges that included aggravated 
assault with a deadly weapon and burglary, court records show.

His criminal history also includes car theft and multiple drug charges, according to Garcia.

‘He is a career criminal, a violent felony offender,' the police chief said.

In the 2005 case, Moran 
entered the apartment of someone he didn't know, picked up a steak 
knife, went into a bedroom and stabbed a man in the abdomen without 
provocation before being subdued, police said. He was sentenced to 10 years in state 
prison but released early.

During his time in prison, Moran was 
found guilty of more than a dozen infractions, including four for drug 
manufacturing and possession, the Department of Corrections records 
show.

He spent his nearly two months of freedom homeless, according to police, and quickly fell back into his old habits.

'Since that time he’s been living primarily in the streets… he immediately went back to his business, that of criminal activity,' Garcia said.

Terra gave Walker last rites after the assault just before he died, sources said. He was moved out of a hospital 
intensive care unit Saturday and is expected to make a full recovery.

Rev. Carl Gismondi, a pastor visiting from San Diego, conducted Mass
 at the priests' church Sunday and said he had visited his fellow 
clergyman at the hospital.

'He was in good spirits,' Gismondi said after the service.

News of the arrest came just as a Mass was to be held for Walker at another church in Phoenix. The cops found their man living in a halfway house in a gritty downtown section of the desert city.

Both the forensic evidence and people he bragged to about the terrifying attacks that came forward to police led to his arrest.

'All the evidence pointed to one man, and that was Gary Michael Moran,' Garcia said.

Mayor Greg Stanton profusely thanked his officers for the quick arrest and said 'Phoenix is safer today because of the men and women of our police department.'

'We're relieved that he's not out 
there doing it again and we hope some good comes out of it for him,' 
Walker's stepsister, Sasha Keys, said of the arrest. She said nearly 
$42,000 in donations had poured in from around the country.

'It was incredible,' she added. 'I'm still getting letters in the mail with checks.'

Police
 previously said Terra gave them a limited description of the suspect. 
Detectives said they were running forensic tests on evidence collected 
at the scene of the assault and from Walker's vehicle, which was found 
abandoned several blocks from the church near the state Capitol.

Police
 said last week they were unsure if there was only one suspect or 
whether robbery was the motive in the attack. Martos declined to say 
whether there was forced entry.

Walker
 was born in upstate New York, had 10 siblings and was drawn to the 
priesthood after attending traditional Latin Mass with his family in 
high school. He later joined the seminary, made good grades and enjoyed 
playing soccer, said the Rev. Joseph Lee, academic dean at the Our Lady 
of Guadalupe Seminary in Nebraska.

Walker
 eventually joined a Catholic order that specializes in Latin Mass and 
became a priest in downtown Phoenix. He recently officiated a younger 
sibling's wedding in Kansas — the last time he saw many relatives.
