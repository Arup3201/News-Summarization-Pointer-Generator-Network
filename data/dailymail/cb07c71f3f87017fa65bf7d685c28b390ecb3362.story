Anthony Dirrell has told his mandatory challenger George Groves that he must 'prove himself' before he is given a shot at his WBC super-middleweight title.

Since being knocked out by Carl Froch at Wembley in May, Groves has responded with back-to-back victories, the first of which made him the No.1 contender in the WBC's 168lb rankings.

In a Sportsmail exclusive in September, Dirrell described Groves as a 'fraud' who did not deserve a crack at his title.

The Saint has since won twice, outpointing Christopher Rebrasse to claim the European title before knocking out Denis Douglin in November.

But, despite those victories, Dirrell's attitude has not changed and he insists he will not be agreeing to a fight with the west Londoner.

When asked about Groves, Dirrell said: 'Who? I don't know that guy.

'Oh that guy who fought Carl Froch and got knocked out by him twice? Oh that guy. 

'There's no interest. Why would there be? He got knocked out twice.

'Why would you get a shot if you got knocked out twice? He's a good fighter but you got knocked out twice.

'You need to prove yourself. You haven't fought anybody yet to prove yourself and won.

'He still has to prove himself. You have to fight, that's how you prove yourself.

'He got knocked out twice. Who deserves a shot after that? That's like me saying, if he had the championship and I got knocked out twice by Carl Froch, they wouldn't want to see me fight the champion.

'Vice versa it's the same thing.'

Groves' promoters, Team Sauerland, have attempted to make contact with Dirrell's representatives to get the ball rolling on their mandatory challenge.

It is unclear whether the Americans are considering their options but Dirrell seems relaxed about the possibility of being stripped of his belt, should he fail to meet his mandatory requirements.

Groves and his promoters are in Las Vegas this week for the WBC convention and are expected to force the issue with the governing body about their plans for the super-middleweight strap.

But Dirrell will be allowed to make a voluntary defence of his title as late as March before being forced to turn his attention to Groves.

Dirrell, the self-styled 'Dog' added: 'We're looking to make money, that's what this business is about. I got the belt, I got what I came here for and now it's time to get paid.

'Me and my management team need to go and see who we want to fight but not yet. We should have one soon and that's what I'm waiting on.'

When asked whether he would consider facing Groves in the UK, considering how much money the Saint generated in ticket sales in 2014, Dirrell replied: 'Never. Why have I got to go over there to fight him if we have to fight? He has to come and see me. That's just how it is. I'm not going to go over there just because. That's not how it works. 

'Floyd [Mayweather] never went anywhere and he's selling out arenas. You've got to come to the Us to fight, to get your name known, before you can you're somebody.'

Eddie Hearn has revealed that Groves could be in line to fight for the vacant IBF title, should Carl Froch vacate it, in an all-British grudge match with James DeGale, meaning the mandatory shot at Dirrell could be put on the back-burner.

On DeGale Dirrell added: 'He's a good fighter, he's an Olympian I heard. He's a good fighter also.'
