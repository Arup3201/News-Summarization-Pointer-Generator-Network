Kate Spade and Jack Spade's whimsical designs will be available in children's sizes for the first time, starting next week.

The two brands have partnered with GapKids for a limited-edition holiday collection, which also marks their first collaboration with each other.

The collection, priced between $9.95 and $130, include playful dresses, graphic sweatshirts, winter accessories and tech cases.

Several of the pieces bear cheeky sayings, such as 'Here comes trouble,' 'Skirt the rules,' 'Pretty sneaky,' and 'Are we there yet?'

Mittens printed with quotation marks, knit hats with antlers and hot dog-printed scarves are among the accessories, while tech accessories feature hamburger motifs and emojis.

The collection is meant to evoke 'a brother and sister imagining their way through a magical journey to grandmother’s house during the holiday season,' according to a press release.

Like GapKids' past designer collections, the preppy-chic items will likely be coveted by grown-ups too.

Limited edition: The collection will be available starting October 30 for two weeks only

Diane von Furstenberg has collaborated with the brand twice, in 2012 and 2013, and Stella McCartney designed a GapKids collection in 2009.

The collection will be available starting October 30 for two weeks only, in select Gap stores and on Gap.com.
