Another day, another problem to address for Manchester United and their imperilled manager David Moyes.

This time it was stories — quickly denied — of a falling-out with one of his coaches, Ryan Giggs. The United icon — so the rumour went — vented his spleen at Moyes in the Old Trafford dressing room in the wake of Sunday’s limp defeat by Liverpool.

‘Ryan is absolutely fuming over suggestions of a falling-out with the manager,’ said a United spokesman on Monday.

Can't watch: Ryan Giggs was an unused substitute against Liverpool

As it turned out, Giggs was jogging 
on the pitch with other unused players when Moyes and his team began 
their dissection of Sunday’s disaster. Even the Welshman can’t argue down the 
length of a players’ tunnel and through a brick wall.

As
 one fire goes out, however, other burning problems do not go away for 
Moyes. Fresh from Sunday’s 3-0 surrender to Liverpool, Moyes must raise 
his team for Wednesday’s Champions League visit of Olympiacos.

Then,
 on Saturday, is a visit to West Ham in the Barclays Premier League 
followed by the arrival of Manchester City next Tuesday. If it sounds 
daunting for Moyes, that’s because it is.

In the directors’ box on Sunday, United officials looked on aghast as the team succumbed meekly, while in the corporate lounges, guests from each of the club’s top sponsors — invited especially for the day — must have wondered what the champions have been spending their money on.

The official line from United is that Moyes remains in no immediate danger. The plan, we are told, remains a long-term one.

The United manager, though, is in trouble, do not think otherwise, and a succession plan may well be put in place within 10 days if things continue to go badly.

Wayne Rooney said Sunday’s 3-0 defeat was ‘one of the worst days I’ve ever had in football’. But Rooney has not had a good day at Old Trafford in a while. The last time he scored there was on October 26. Since then, 22 players have scored at Old Trafford:

UNITED: Javier Hernandez (4), Danny Welbeck (3), Robin van Persie (3), Ashley Young (2), Phil Jones (2), Fabio, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans, Adnan Januzaj.

OPPONENTS: Gerrard (Liverpool, 2) Oviedo (Everton), Cabaye (Newcastle), C Cole (West Ham), Adebayor,  Eriksen (Tottenham), Routledge, Bony (Swansea),  Bardsley (Sunderland), Sidwell, Bent (Fulham), Suarez (Liverpool).

On social networking sites and fan 
forums on Monday, the groundswell of opinion against Moyes continued to 
grow. Even the more rational are beginning to tire of United’s insipid 
football and a manager who rarely seems to say or do anything to inspire
 confidence in his ability to reverse a downward trend.

However, the remarkable and prolonged
 support afforded United from the Stretford End during the last 10 
minutes of Sunday’s defeat has worked in Moyes’s favour.

It
 was noted by the Old Trafford directors as a tick in a column of 
positives that was looking as empty as some of United’s performances.

What
 is abundantly clear is that nobody at United — apart from the odd 
disaffected player — wants to see Moyes sacked. What is also apparent, 
however, is that United will have to get rid of him if things don’t 
improve quickly.

As United fans and officials stare down the A580 at their resurgent Merseyside rivals, they can comfort themselves with the fact that, while Liverpool remain a big and important football club, United have grown into an international financial monster.

As such, the defending champions are in a position to throw millions of pounds at their problems this summer. The only question is whether they can — or should — trust Moyes to spend it.

Moyes’s United have a shambolic look about them and they are getting worse. Other Premier League coaches talk privately of unimaginative tactics and square pegs in round holes.

And the rumours may not be true, but it 
nevertheless remains the case that Giggs has appeared to be a rather 
distant, detached figure at Old Trafford of late.

Support: It appears Moyes is not getting the backing he needs from either the players or the fans

Hurting: Giggs is said to be upset by United's slump and there has even been suggestion he could replace Moyes as manager

Unveiled as part of the new world 
order when Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson last May, the 40-year-old 
has been increasingly less visible on the touchline and indeed as a 
player as crisis has followed crisis at Old Trafford.

One
 theory is that Giggs may yet be the next United manager — temporarily 
or otherwise — and is merely biding his time. That, though, doesn’t fit 
with what we know of a loyal United servant who, rather like his friend 
Gary Neville, takes every defeat, at whatever level, as a personal 
affront.

Schooled at The Cliff, Carrington and Old Trafford, Giggs knows that success comes 
in cycles. He hasn’t seen much like this during his 23 years at 
first-team level, though.

Dressing-room arguments — real or invented — 
pale into insignificance when the team are 18 points from the top of the
 Premier League.
