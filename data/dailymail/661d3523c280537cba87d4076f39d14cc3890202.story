A sex pest who terrorised women with 17,000 perverted phone calls in just one year has been jailed for 30 months.

Married Martin Poulter, 51, from Southampton, made calls to random numbers at night in the hopes a female would answer.

He would then breathe heavily and make 'disgusting, lewd sexual comments' as he described what he was doing to himself.

Guilty: Martin Poulter was sentenced to jail for 30 months after he made almost 17,000 inappropriate calls to random women

Spending almost all of his £440 monthly 
benefits on credit for his unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phone, he 
visited the same Co-op store so often staff even named him 'top up man'.

It transpired he was spending around £5,280 a year on phone credit.

Poulter made a staggering 16,690 calls on his phone between January 2010 and February 2011, 13,346 of which were dialled between 11pm and 6am.

Southampton Crown Court heard that some of his victims were targeted repeatedly, leaving them scared and physically sick as he 'moaned and groaned' down the phone.

The youngest victim of his 'deeply disturbing' campaign was just 17.

The court was told Poulter simply changed digits in mobile numbers, randomly dialling people across the country, hanging up if a man answered. 

Prosecutor Siobhan Linsley traced back Poulter's calls to January 2010, saying one woman from Wiltshire had phoned police to report receiving 'obscene' calls in the middle of the night.

She lived alone with two young children and said she felt threatened by the anonymous one-minute-long calls.

Her mobile phone company provided her with the number that had been calling her but police could not trace the owner as it was not registered.

Another victim was a student who was subjected to 'diabolical language' in the middle of her exams.

In October 2010 police were informed that top-up cards were being bought for the phone at a Co-op store in Southampton.

Detectives investigated and traced 21 victims around the country, who provided statements.

Workers at the store were initially unable to identify the man, but when police returned in January 2011 staff knew exactly who he was - and revealed they had nicknamed him 'top-up man' because he visited so often.

Poulter was eventually traced when he used his wife’s Co-op store card.

When police went to his home they found he had made his final nuisance call just moments before they arrived.

He initially denied the offence but admitted one charge of making public nuisance phone calls on the day he was due to stand trial.

Jamie Porter, defending, said Poulter was 'sexually frustrated'.

He agreed any suggestion Poulter would stop offending went 'against all common sense'.

Jailing Poulter for 30 months, Judge Peter Henry QC described the phone calls as 'deeply disturbing'.

'They were completely random and you had no idea whether you were going to be talking to a person under 16 or not.

'They were highly unpleasant and upsetting.

'Your victims had no idea whether you were around the corner, watching them, or just a sad person calling from somewhere else in the country.'

It’s not the first time that Poulter has struck.

Almost 20 years ago, in 1985, he was before the courts for similar public nuisance offences.

He made around 200 calls to women in which he told them he was holding someone they knew hostage.

He then threatened to kill or harm his imaginary hostage unless they complied with his sexual requests.

Poulter was then convicted of four counts of making threats to kill and a further charge of causing a public nuisance.

Today’s custodial sentence is believed to be the first since the law surrounding 'public nuisance' was changed to include silent and disturbing calls.

Detective Constable Amy Speed, who led the investigation, said after the case, 'A huge number of women around the country will sleep better tonight knowing their tormentor has been given a custodial sentence.

'His actions were despicable and cowardly and the impact should not be underestimated.

'His victims had their privacy and security of their homes invaded'.
