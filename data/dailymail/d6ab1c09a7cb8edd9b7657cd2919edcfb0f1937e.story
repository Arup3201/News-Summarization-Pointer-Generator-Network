Debbie Vincent arrives at Winchester Crown Court for her blackmail trial. She had been accused of being one of Europe's most dangerous animal rights fanatics

A former British soldier was unmasked yesterday as one of Europe’s most dangerous animal rights fanatics.

Debbie Vincent, 52, spent a decade masterminding attacks on suppliers of the continent’s largest animal testing laboratory.

She was behind a relentless onslaught of threats and violence designed to destroy Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) in Cambridgeshire.

Vincent and her accomplices created a chilling ‘climate of fear’ as they used ‘any means necessary’ to stop those trading with the company.

Homes were attacked with fire bombs, employees were falsely accused of paedophilia and items supposedly contaminated with the AIDS virus were sent in the post.

An urn containing the ashes of a former company chairman’s mother was stolen from a graveyard. It was never recovered.

Vincent, who became a militant animal rights extremist following a sex change, was told she faces a long jail term after she was convicted of conspiracy to blackmail.

Winchester Crown Court heard Vincent was a key member of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (Shac), which is linked to the Animal Liberation Front.

It blackmailed companies that traded with HLS by threatening to post their details online – helping others to mount attacks – unless they agreed in writing to stop.

Based at a small cottage in the village of Little Moorcote in Hampshire, members plotted their campaign with military precision, compiling detailed dossiers on their targets.

Most of the crimes commited against the Huntingdon Life Sciences research centre were trying to destroy it. Some of the incidences were incredibly violent crimes, including blackmail and allegedly trying to infect people with the AIDS virus

They funded their attacks with £1million raised from high street collections and groomed middle-class teenagers to become senior members of their network.

Among them were a former prefect at a girls’ public school and the sons of a building society manager.

Shac’s reach extended to the US as well as all over Europe, including Switzerland, Holland, Sweden, France, Belgium and Germany.

Vincent first became involved in the group in 2001 but gradually took centre stage as its leading members were arrested and finally jailed in 2009.

Shac specialised in attacking the ‘supply lines’ to HLS after its work to target the laboratory itself was frustrated by UK authorities.

A core of up to 15 extremists obtained company details by deception and threatened to post them on shadowy website Bite Back, a magazine for the radical animal rights movement.

Others then used the information to launch attacks on company buildings and the homes of senior employees.

Vincent travelled to Germany to meet the head of security at healthcare giant Novartis in a bid to stop its trading with HLS.

Workers at Novartis HQ in Basel, Switzerland, as well as those in Germany and France, had suffered escalating attacks over two years. 

The words ‘paedophile’, ‘scum’ and ‘Drop HLS’ were emblazoned on homes and businesses, two vehicles were set on fire and a sport pavilion in France was razed to the ground.

The campaign culminated in July 2009 in the theft of the ashes of former chairman Dr Daniel Vasella’s mother from a graveyard in Austria.

Vincent told the court Shac had ‘no control’ over what people did once information was in the public domain. 

‘We think the police have been very ill-advised,’ she said. ‘We are not terrorists at all, we are just everyday people.

We are compassionate, we have a different way of looking at things, we think of humans and all things, not just human health.’

A clip of a BBC Inside Out documentary was shown to the jury in which she said animal rights groups are ‘upping the ante’, adding: ‘Yes, we will up the ante because if nobody is going to listen to what we say then all we have got is protest.’

Vincent joined the Army aged 16 in a bid to escape her ‘Victorian family’ and was posted to Germany.

But she left two-and-a-half years later after military police found women’s clothes among her belongings and exposed her cross-dressing. 

The activist, who was born Peter Vincent Rogers, broke down in court as she told the jury how she had wanted to be a girl from the age of seven, but married a woman and had a son before undergoing a sex change.

Two other suspected Shac members, Sven Van Hasselt and Natasha Simkins, are fighting extradition from Holland to the UK to face trial.

Vincent, of Easton, Bristol, was convicted of conspiracy to commit blackmail between November 2001 and August 2011, for which the maximum penalty is 14 years in jail.

She will be sentenced on April 17.
