Discovered: Belgian 17-year-old Axelle Despiegelaere won a contract to model for L'Oreal

A Belgium World Cup fan who won a modelling contact with L'Oreal after being spotted cheering in the crowd has been revealed as a big fan of game hunting.

Axelle Despiegelaere, 17, caught the world's attention after being photographed cheering on her national team in the Group H match against Russia and her image spread across the internet.

But her public success may be short lived as now a photo has emerged of the teenager posing with a rifle and a dead animal in Africa.

'Hunting is
 not a matter of life or death. It's much more important than that,' she
 said on her Facebook page reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 

L'Oreal
 has not responded to the revelations, but it is keen to promote it's 
image of animal welfare - in 2012 the company donated $1.2million to the
 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help improve the testing of 
safe chemicals.

In
 the photo which scored Axelle her contract she doned red, yellow and 
black face paint and a horned hat when she was spotted at the match in 
Brazil.
