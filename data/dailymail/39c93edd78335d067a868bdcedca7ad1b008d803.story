Paramedics were forced to wait outside a hospital for two-and-a-half hours until beds became available for their patients, it has been revealed.

A review is being carried out after extra staff had to be drafted in to the James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, to help ease the pressure on A&E.

Seven pre-planned operations also had to be cancelled at the hospital over 27 and 28 of September.

Concerns were raised by ambulance crews who claimed to have been left off the road for up to two-and-a-half hours while waiting for a bed.

One paramedic said a normal wait would be 10-15 minutes, with two-and-a-half hours the worst they said they had known.

The whole of the North-east was said to have been busy for admissions on Thursday with the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) saying Middlesbrough was most under strain.

The ambulance service said in one hour alone they received 999 calls for four ‘Red 1’ incidents - the most serious classification of calls, where patients have suffered either a cardiac arrest or have stopped breathing.

Normally they would expect to receive one or two.

Spokeswomen for both James Cook University Hospital and the NEAS said the sudden increased pressure could not have been anticipated.

Last week’s flooding was ruled out as a cause.

A spokeswoman for the NEAS said: 'The North East Ambulance Service works closely with colleagues in hospitals across the North-east to try and minimise any handover delays.

'We do this by trying to anticipate any peaks in demand, and make the necessary arrangements.

'However some busy periods cannot be anticipated.'
