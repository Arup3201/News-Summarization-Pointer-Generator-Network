Adelaide carnivores beware: a new study shows most supermarket deli meats are carrying bacteria in levels that exceed food safety guidelines.

The study found 134 out of 174 samples of various ready-to-eat deli meats bought at randomly selected supermarkets across South Australia, had bacterial levels that failed to meet guidelines.

Professor Michael Reichel was part of the study by Adelaide University which found a poor level of hygienic food handling of deli meats by Adelaide retailers

The results of the research, carried out last year by students at Adelaide University, will be presented this week at a Perth conference.

'Although no recognised food poisoning pathogens such as Escherichia coli or Salmonella species were found on these meats, the high bacterial count suggests that hygiene has been compromised,' said the university's Professor Michael Reichel.

'Such out-of-control processes are also susceptible to contamination with serious food poisoning organisms.'

Sliced salami, fritz and roast pork showed the highest proportions of unsatisfactory bacterial counts.

Ham and chicken meats had lower levels of bacteria, but two-thirds of those samples still failed to meet satisfactory standards.

He said 15.5 per cent of samples showed the presence of coliform bacteria, indicating possible faecal contamination and poor hygiene such as people not washing their hands after going to the toilet.

But despite the results, one of the project's researchers, Tristan Marks, told Channel 7 News that consumers shouldn't be worried about getting seriously ill.

77 per cent of various ready-to-eat deli meats from randomly selected supermarkets across South Australia, had bacterial levels that failed to meet Australian food standards guidelines

'We haven’t found anything that's going to make you sick, all it means is that it might go off quicker once you bring it home,' Mr Marks said.

Professor Reichel confirmed that the samples were taken from a wide variety of locations including Coles, Woolworths, IGA, Foodland and some randomly selected local butchers.

As well as revealing food safety issues, the results related to food quality.

'People have a right to expect that the product they buy on the weekend should last through the following week, not go slimy in a couple of days,' he said.

He called on supermarkets and retailers to review their processes and staff compliance, as well as carry out more microbiological testing.
