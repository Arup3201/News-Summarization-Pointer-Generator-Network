Laid back: Pope Francis will hold the papal Holy Thursday service in Casal del Marmo, a youth jail on the outskirts of Rome, where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates

After only a week at the helm of the Catholic Church, he has already earned himself the nickname the People's Pope due to his candid nature and willingness to break from tradition.

But even the most ardent reformers within the church will raise an eyebrow at Pope Francis's latest proposal, as the Vatican announced that he will hold next week's Holy Thursday service in a youth prison.

During the service at the Casal del Marmo jail, situated on the outskirts of Rome, the Argentine pontiff is expected to wash and kiss the feet 12 prisoners.

The 76-year-old's gesture reflects that of Jesus on the night of the Last Supper, when he washed the feet of his disciples.

The ceremony carries added poignancy, given that it will be the first Holy Thursday service held outside either St Peter's Basilica or the basilica of St John in Lateran.

Since being elected to head the church following Pope Benedict XVI's historic decision to step down, Pope Francis has surprised senior Vatican officials by staging spontaneous walkabouts.

He also prompted a receptionist to exclaim 'If you're the Pope, I'm Napoleon' during conversation when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome only to be put through to the switchboard.

But his decision to break with tradition for next week's service will surprise nobody in his native Argentine, where he washed the feet of Aids sufferers and met with sex workers.

His predecessor Pope Benedict also washed the feet of lay people in his first two years in the Vatican, but only performed the gesture on priests since 2008.

John Paul II washed the feet of a group of homeless men in 1980 but the mass was held in the Bishop of Rome's cathedral.

For most of his tenure however, Pope John Paul II only performed the gesture on members of the clergy.

The Vatican said that next week's ceremony will be a continuation of his work as the archbishop of Buenos Aires, when he celebrated the holy day in shelters, hospitals and prisons.

The 'context of simplicity' has underpinned much of Pope Francis's life in the church - he is known to take the bus, prefer smaller residences and wear old shoes.

Francis's visit to the youth prison will be the its second papal visit. Benedict XVI travelled there in 2007, although not during Holy Week.

Before his visit, Francis will fly to Castel Gandolfo where Benedict XVI has been living since quitting the Vatican for health reasons.

The pair will have a lunch meeting, while both wearing papal white robes.

It is still unsure where Francis will choose to live, as maintenance work is being carried out on the Apostolic Palace, but Benedict XVI will move into an apartment within the Vatican in a matter of weeks.

Pope
Francis' informal style got the better of him when he telephoned a 
Vatican receptionist directly and was told: 'And I'm Napoleon.'

The
new pope, according to Croatian religious website Bitno.net, had 
announced himself when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome on Friday 
and got through to the switchboard.

He had been trying to contact Adolfo Nicolas, the superior general of the Pope's old Jesuit order.

But
the baffled receptionist - identified only as Andreas - thought someone
was playing a trick on him and quipped back: 'Oh yes? And I'm 
Napoleon.'

His holiness 
eventually got through, after managing to convince the receptionist he 
was genuine saying: 'I really am Pope Francis.'

One
Vatican expert explained: 'You can't really blame the poor man.  No 
other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls.  An
official usually calls a secretary who places the call.

'The
receptionist is extremely distraught but I think the new pope has a 
good sense of humour and will laugh it off,' they added.
