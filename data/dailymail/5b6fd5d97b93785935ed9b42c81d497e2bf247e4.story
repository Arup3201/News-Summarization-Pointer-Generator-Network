A mother who headbutted and then bit part of a woman's nose off in a 'shark-style' attack during a children's pantomime was today jailed for six years. 

Tina Love, 29, lunged at mother-of-three Julie McDonald, 50, before pinning her down and then biting a chunk from her nose.

The 'nasty assault' happened after a 'stupid and childish' disagreement about a table during a Jack and the Beanstalk show at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex.

A 3cm by 3cm piece of the victim's nose was found on the floor after the attack on April 11, 2013. 

Jailed: Tina Love was today sentenced to six years after violently assaulting mum-of-three Julie McDonald at Butlins in Bognor Regis. She was found guilty of wounding with intent following the vicious attack where she bit part of the victim's nose off and spat it out

Today Love - who attended court with a pre-packed suitcase after a jury took just 48 minutes to convict her of wounding with intent - was locked up for six years.  

Prosecutor Rachel Beckett said mum-of-three Love had launched a sustained assault, described as like a 'shark attack', which left Ms McDonald scarred for life and suffering low self-esteem. 

In a victim impact statement read in court, Ms McDonald said the attack had left her living a 'nightmare that I just can't seem to wake up from'. 

Part of Ms McDonald's nose had to be reattached during surgery following Love's 'appalling' attack on her, prosecutors said.

Love, from Dartford, Kent, was found guilty of wounding with intent following a trial which ended last month.

Chichester Crown Court heard the day before the assault there had been some 'interaction' between the McDonald family and the defendant.

Love's two young children were seen 'laughing' and 'swearing' at Ms McDonald's son, who has 'severe learning difficulties'. 

During her trial, a jury had heard how on the night of the attack, the whole McDonald family went down to the Centre Stage of the Manhattan Building at Butlins to watch the pantomime.

After finding a table, which appeared to be free, the victim sat down but was confronted by Love who said: 'Oi, that's my table'.

The defendant then waved her finger in Ms McDonald's face and asked: 'What are you going to do about it?'

Love then 'lunged' at Ms McDonald and 'headbutted' her before biting her nose. Ms McDonald, a full-time carer, felt it was like her 'entire nose was being bitten off'.

Pantomime: The attack happened at Butlins Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, after a 'stupid and childish' disagreement about a table

Jailing Love, Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith QC said: 'You have been found guilty by a jury on clear evidence in what was a vicious attack on Ms McDonald.

'You undertook this attack with the intent of causing Ms McDonald serious harm.

'This happened in front of a theatre full of children and families at 7pm, looking to enjoy an evening of entertainment watching the pantomime.

'It was in a theatre in front of 450 people - a large number of them children - and virtually all of them were families, so the timing could not have been worse.

'The incident arose from a stupid and childish dispute about whose table was whose.

'You lost control, you wagged your finger in her face and when she started to move you launched a headbutt with all of your might and then bit her nose.

'You bit and bit and you actually bit off a significant chunk of her nose which you then spat out on the floor.'

Disgraced: Mum-of-three Tina Love was today sentenced to six years following the assault in April 2013. Victim Ms McDonald described the assault as like a 'shark attack'

Ms McDonald, from Aylesbury, Bucks, described the assault as a 'shark attack'.

She said: 'She launched herself at me and I felt this person biting my nose with full force. I have never been bitten by a shark but that is the only think I can liken it to.

'It was like being attacked by a shark. There was this person biting my nose with all of her might. It felt like my whole nose was being bitten off. I was completely traumatised.'

Today, Love sat in the dock with her head in her hands as the victim impact statement described the toll taken on Ms McDonald, who has a disabled child.

Ms McDonald said she was rushed to hospital, and had two black eyes, a scar across the top of her nose and a yellow surgical sponge pinned to her face to hold her nose together.

Sleepless nights, anxiety and fear followed the attack, she added, and she cannot breathe easily from her misshapen nose, which she has to cover in sun-screen in all seasons as it reddens.

In her victim statement, she said: 'Up until the night of the incident we had enjoyed our stay at Butlins. The children had a great time and we were ready to go home the following morning.

'We attended the theatre that evening looking forward to the pantomime. My two younger children had gone to the front of the stage to watch the show whilst (my daughter) had taken her homework to the show to study for her exams.

'What happened to me next has devastated me beyond words. The assault on me was unwarranted, unprovoked and has left me scarred for life.

'I was left in the theatre covered in blood with one of my children next to me as I screamed out in shock and pain. 

'You can't hide from this. It is there every day staring me in the face when I look in the mirror and I have to deal with this for the rest of my life.'

Neil Guest, defending, said Love will lose her local authority home and be separated from her three children, aged eight, five and four.

Describing her as a 'true, caring mother', he said in mitigation that she had no previous convictions, had not been in trouble since the attack and was at low risk of re-offending.

Mr Guest said: 'She's a true, caring mother who helps strangers and gives to charities. What came over her that night we simply don't know. Whatever did happen was totally and completely out of character.'
