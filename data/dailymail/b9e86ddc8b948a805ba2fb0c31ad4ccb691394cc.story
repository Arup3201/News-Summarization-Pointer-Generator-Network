A new lawsuit has revealed the extent of former President Clinton's friendship with a fundraiser who was later jailed for having sex with an underage prostitute.

Bill Clinton's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who served time in 2008 for his illegal sexual partners, included up multiple trips to the onetime billionaire's private island in the Caribbean where underage girls were allegedly kept as sex slaves.

The National Enquirer has released new details about the two men's friendship, which seems to have ended abruptly around the time of Epstein's arrest.

Pedophile paradise: The lawsuit included flight records that showed Clinton made multiple trips to Epstein's private island, Little St James (pictured), between 2002 and 2005. Women were reportedly kept there as sex slaves

Tales of orgies and young girls being shipped to the island, called Little St. James, have been revealed as part of an ongoing lawsuit between Epstein and his former lawyers Scott Rothstein and Bradley Edwards.

It is unclear what the basis of the suit is, but they go on to call witness testimony from some of the frequent guests at Epstein's island to talk about the wild parties that were held there in the early 2000s.

Convicted: Epstein was investigated in 2005 after a woman reported that he paid her 14-year-old daughter for sex

Flight logs pinpoint Clinton's trips on Epstein's jet between the years 2002 and 2005, while he was working on his philanthropic post-presidential career and while his wife Hillary was a Senator for their adopted state of New York.

'I remember asking Jeffrey what's Bill Clinton doing here kind fo thing, and he laughed it off and said well he owes me a favor,' one unidentified woman said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Palm Beach Circuit Court.

The woman went on to say how orgies were a regular occurrence and she recalled two young girls from New York who were always seen around the five-house compound but their personal backstories were never revealed.

At least one woman on the compound was there unwillingly, as the suit identifies a woman as Jane Doe 102.

She 'was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years and was forced to have sex with... politicians, businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc,' the lawsuit says according to The Enquirer.

Epstein's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005, when a woman in Palm Beach contacted police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex.

The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender.Â 

Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.

Keeping ties: Clinton was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of underage girls for Epstein, and though Clinton cut ties with Epstein after his arrest, he invited the woman to Chelsea's 2010 wedding

Clinton's connection to Epstein, who 
worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than 40 
women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has 
been long-established, but The Enquirer also tells how the former 
president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy acquaintances.

The
 lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who 'kept
 images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit 
underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in 
sexually explicit poses'.

While he cut off ties with Epstein, this woman's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she was reportedly one of the 400 guests at Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding.

Though the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton's from Clinton's past, he has added to the drama of late by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month.

The drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for Clinton family loyalists, as a Wall Street Journal article released today details how

'I'm not in the political camp; I'm in the friends camp. And the friends camp definitely has concerns about her running,' the former Secretary of State's friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason told the paper,
