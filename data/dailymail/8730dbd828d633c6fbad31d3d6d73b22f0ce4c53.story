It has already infiltrated the four corners of the globe with its cameras, meticulously building up an online archive of street-level photography.

However, not content with documenting virtually every inch of the planet's landmass, Google is preparing to take its Earth feature to new depths when it ventures into the underwater world.

Soon, users will be able to 'swim' around Australia's Great Barrier Reef from the comfort of their own home - simply by going online.

Underwater world: The view from inside the Catlin Seaview camera, which specialist divers have used for months to capture thousands of 360-degree underwater panoramas of the Australian beauty spot

Specialist divers spent months capturing 
thousands of 360-degree underwater panoramas of the beauty spot.

They
 have now stitched 50,000 photographs together to create the Catlin 
Seaview Survey, a sub-aquatic version of Google Street View.

The
 groundbreaking project will allow users to go on a virtual dive of up 
to 100 metres while surrounded by stunning scenery and beautiful ocean 
life.

Initially, users will
 be able to view the reef on the Catlin Seaview Survey map but, in the 
future, the whole project is to be integrated into Google Earth by
 the internet giant's Panoramio tool - giving users a 360-degree view of
 the World Heritage Site.

How it might look: Users will have the chance to navigate their own way around the coral reefs, as this mock-up shows

It
 is part of the first comprehensive study to document and reveal the 
composition and health of coral reefs on the Great Barrier Reef.

Scientists
 hope any data gathered from the project will strengthen the 
understanding of how climate and other environmental changes are 
affecting eco-sytems like the Great Barrier Reef.

Professor
 Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the Global Change institute at The 
University of Queensland, believes the visual nature of the project will
 bridge the gap behind scientific knowledge and public awareness.

He
 said: 'The Catlin Seaview Survey comprises a series of studies which 
will reveal to the public one of the last frontiers on Earth: the 
oceans.

'For the first time in history, we have the technology available to broadcast the findings and expedition through Google.

'Millions
 of people will be able to experience the life, the science and the 
magic that exists under the surface of our oceans. This project is very 
exciting.'

Over the coming years the Survey - 
carried out by Underwater Earth - intends to expand globally to reveal 
the oceans in regions of importance all over the world.
