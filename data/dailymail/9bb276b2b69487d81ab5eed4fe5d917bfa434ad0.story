Victim Sandra Nowocinska,22, died in hospital four days after being rescued from the suspected arson attack

A 22-year-old mother has died in hospital four days after she was rescued from a suspected arson attack on a block of flats.

Sandra Nowocinska, whose death is being treated as manslaughter, was injured along with her five-year-old son in a suspicious fire in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

A spokesman for West Mercia Police said Ms Nowocinska died yesterday afternoon with her family at her side.

Her son, who has not been named by police, remains in a serious but stable condition at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Firefighters rescued the mother and son from an apartment above a shop in Horsefair, Kidderminster, after being alerted at 9.55pm last Thursday.

Two other people were treated for the effects of smoke inhalation.

Eyewitnesses described a bang followed by a 'big cloud of smoke' as several people jumped from flats above the Dress 4 Less shop.

Dramatic video phone footage captured the moment a Domino's pizza lorry pulled up to the property to allow a man to escape by jumping on top of the HGV.

Terry Thomas, 63, said: 'Someone had the presence of mind to stop a pizza truck by walking out into the road.

'It pulled up towards the window as close as it could get and two lads jumped out on to the top of that from the window.'

Paying tribute to Ms Nowocinska, childhood friend Ewelina Wojtera, 23, from Perry Barr, Birmingham, said: 'We grew up together in Poland. I've probably known her about nine or ten years.

'She was a very happy person, always smiling. There was no one who met her who didn't like her. She was an absolutely brilliant mum too.

'Sandra was always there for everyone, including me.

'When I heard she was in hospital in a critical condition we were all hoping she was going to make it. I can't believe she has gone. Everyone is just in shock.

'Her family want to take her body back to Poland but they're worried about the cost.'

Ms Nowocinska was originally from the town of Grudziadz in northern Poland, where both her parents still live.

She moved to England a year ago but had only lived in the Kidderminster flat that caught fire for a few months.

Detective Inspector Leighton Harding said: 'A dedicated team of detectives and staff continue to investigate the circumstances around the fire, which is being treated as suspicious.

'We are treating Sandra's death as manslaughter and we would appeal for anyone with any information that may help the investigation to contact us.'

A 41-year-old local man arrested last week on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life has been released on bail.
