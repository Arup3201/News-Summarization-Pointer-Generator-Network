Travellers may experience airport delays and holiday disruptions if the U.S. Government decides to tighten security measures ahead of new intelligence signalling a possible airliner attack.

Concerns a new generation of innovation in bomb making is being developed in the battlegrounds of Iraq and Syria could prompt a tightening of security across European and U.S. airports.

It would likely disrupt travel plans and cause airport chaos for those heading away this summer, although the U.S. Government has not yet formally declared what it intends to do.

The intelligence has revealed the groups are developing new covert weapons as well as recruiting willing plot members from the large number of foreigners currently fighting in the region.

Many of these radicalised fighters carry European and U.S. passports and have travelled to the region to help ISIS establish its Islamic State, or join the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al Nusrah Front.

ISIS has been responsible for executions and other atrocities during its surge to the edge of Baghdad

ABC News reported U.S. analysts believed a section of extreme terrorists in Syria were planning to attack a U.S. or Europe-bound plane, aided by any number of the thousands of U.S. or European passport holders fighting in the region.

To try and stop the attacks, one source told the network the new airport security measures could include increasing rates of random screenings, targeting certain types of travellers and increasing its armed air marshall presence.

Fighting across the region has been brutal in recent weeks with ISIS carrying out mass executions and crucifixions so blood thirsty it has been branded too extreme by Al-Qaeda.

The United Nations said more 
than 2,400 Iraqis had been killed in June alone, making the current 
violence the most deadly since the height of sectarian warfare in 2007.

ISIS yesterday declared it would now call itself The Islamic State â€“ to reflect the territory it controls across Syria and Iraq and its goal of establishing an Islamic state across the entire Middle East, North Africa and parts of Europe by the year 2020.

The announcement, made on the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, could trigger a wave of infighting among Sunni extremist factions that have until now formed a loose rebel alliance.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of ISIS and the person to announce the creation of the new Islamic state

A spokesman for ISIS declared the group's chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the leader of the new caliphate, or Islamic state, and called on Muslims everywhere, not just those in areas under the organization's control, to swear loyalty to him.

The group currently controls a large slice of Syria and Iraq, and conquered large swathes of territory at breakneck pace in recent weeks before slowing down when it found itself at the edge of Baghdad.

As well as plans to expand its caliphate throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and large parts of western Asia, the map also marks out an expansion in parts of Europe.

Spain, which was ruled by Muslims for 700 years until 1492, is marked out as a territory the caliphate plans to have under its control by 2020.

Elsewhere, ISIS plans to take control of the the Balkan states - including Greece, Romania and Bulgaria - extending its territories in eastern Europe as far as Austria, which appears to be based on a pre-First World War borders of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
