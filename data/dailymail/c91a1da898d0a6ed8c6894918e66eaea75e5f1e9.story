Actor William Shatner has been forced to deny he will be switching on the Christmas lights in a Cheshire market town after being caught up in hoax.

The Star Trek legend took to his Twitter account to say he was not booked to switch on the festive lights in Frodsham after promotional material advertising his appearance was circulated online.

Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the cult sci-fi series, joked: 'There's a reason why the word Sham is in the name!' before confirming the rumours weren't true.

Denial: The Hollywood actor confirmed he would not be attending the event as it was revealed to be a hoax

It came after the Twitter account @Frodshamxmas claimed the actor was set to appear at this Saturday's light switch-on in the town, which is best known for being the former home of Take That star Gary Barlow.

The account tweeted a picture of 83-year-old Shatner, with a signed 'quote' from him that read: 'I'm very excited to be coming to Frodsham.

'I've long been fascinated by the glacial landscape of the Cheshire countryside - its vast plain and sandstone ridges, not unlike some distant planet visited by the crew of the Enterprise! See you there!'

Other 'promotional' material featured his face on a poster of the event, alongside the words: 'With special guest William 'Captain Kirk' Shatner'.

Another tweet also claimed the actor would be 'singing some songs from his new Christmas album' at the switch-on, and accompanied the message with an old video of him performing Rocket Man.

However, the Hollywood actor took to his Twitter page to deny he would be attending the event.

He wrote: 'The village of Frodsham UK is promising I will turn on holiday lights? There's a reason why the word Sham is in the name! Sorry, not true'

Promotional: Fake posters of the event showing the actor's face and branding him the 'special guest' of this weekend's lights-switch on event were circulated online, sparking widespread rumours he would attend

Fake: The Frodsham Xmas 2014 Twitter account also suggested Shatner would be performing at the event

Councillor Mike Pusey, chairman of Love Frodsham which helps organise the switch-on, ruefully admitted: 'It's a hoax. The account has been set up by a young lad who has done it as a joke.

'Fortunately I don't think it will cause any hassle, as I don't think for one minute people would have believed that William Shatner would come and switch the lights on.

'It would have been more of a problem if they had said it was Gary Barlow, as he's from here so people might have believed that.'

Mr Pusey said there were other attractions at this weekend's event and added: 'Santa will be here from 12pm until 8pm, and we've got face painters and children's entertainers, with no charge to the public.

'We've also got market stalls, performances by local schools and live bands.' 

Frodsham is a small market town in Cheshire, best known as the former home of Take That's Gary Barlow
