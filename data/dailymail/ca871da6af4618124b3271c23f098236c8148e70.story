Iago Aspas was given a rough welcome back to La Liga after feeling the full force of Cadiz striker Kike Lopez's head on Saturday in a friendly.

This wan't a headbutt where a player barely brushes another as they both fall to the ground; on-loan Liverpool man Aspas was caught full on by Lopez after a minor scuffle during a friendly match in Spain.

Not happy: Aspas reacts angrily to a nasty challenge from Lopez, and stands up to face him

Failed: Aspas moved to Liverpool from Celta Vigo last summer but made just 15 appearances

Aspas reacted angrily to a hefty challenge from Lopez, before the Cadiz man returned the favour in a more violent fashion.

A red card was shown to Lopez, unsurprisingly, and a brawl ensued during Sevilla's 3-0 win.

Aspas, 26, moved to Liverpool from Celta Vigo last summer but had a disappointing season and made just 15 appearances, the majority as a substitute, and scored one goal.

Butted: Lopez then crashes his head into Aspas' cheek as the former Liverpool man falls to the ground

Also on Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta received a suspected broken nose after being headbutted by Bastia forward Brandao following Laurent Blanc's side's 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes.

Video footage shows Brandao waiting for the Italian midfielder in the tunnel after the final whistle, smashing his forehead into Motta's face and then running away.
