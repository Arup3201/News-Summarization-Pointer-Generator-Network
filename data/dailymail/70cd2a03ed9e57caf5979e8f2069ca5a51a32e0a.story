Jody Cundy recognises the clock is ticking as he bids for Paralympic gold four years on from his notorious explosion at London 2012.

Cundy was favourite for victory in the London 2012 C4/C5 one-kilometre time-trial at the Olympic Velodrome, only for his Games to end in an explosive rant at officials.

Race commissaries deemed rider failure to be the result of a start gate issue; Cundy argued it was faulty, but his protests were dismissed.

It was a seminal moment of the Paralympics, when the watching public realised Paralympians are athletes first and foremost.

Now Cundy, a five-time Paralympic champion swimmer and cyclist, is going for gold at the Rio Games in 2016, with the Paracycling Track World Championships, which begin on Thursday, a key indicator.

The 36-year-old from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire said: 'I've always got that missed gold in London that's always playing on the back of my mind.

'That helps me get up in the morning, continue training and make sure we put all the wrongs to right when we get to Rio.

'I seem to be still getting faster and in training I'm in better form than I was prior to London.

'I'm not getting any younger, but I'm good enough to keep going through to Rio.

'Apeldoorn's going to be the first checkpoint to see if I'm on target.'

Cundy acknowledges Tokyo 2020, when he will be 41, may be four years too far and Rio may be his last chance.

He added: 'I keep thinking I'm new to the sport, but I joined the squad in 2006. This is my eighth year on the team.

'I've nearly had as many years on the cycling team as I had on the swimming team.

'It's certainly getting harder with each year I do it.'

Yet Cundy is still making improvements.

Despite being hospitalised to intensive care last November with a swollen epiglottis, Cundy bounced back to post a sea-level personal best in his favoured kilo event at the Newport International event in January.

The track in Apeldoorn, Holland which hosts this week's competition is not known for being fast, though, so returning with the world champion's rainbow jersey is the primary objective.

Cundy added: 'It's about winning the world title and performing as well as I can against my main competitors.'

Cundy, a C4 athlete who is a below-knee amputee, races against riders with a lesser impairment than his own in Paralympic competition.

The times posted are factored, but Cundy wants to be quicker than all of his C4 and C5 rivals in Rio.

'On the factors they've currently got it's about a 0.6 or 0.8 (of a second) advantage I've got,' he added.

'But I'd rather win on time, be faster on time, that way there's no doubts.'

Cundy is joined in the team by 11-time Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey, who is defending two world titles.

Neil Fachie and his pilot Pete Mitchell are also defending their one-kilometre time-trial tandem title, while Commonwealth Games winning pair Sophie Thornhill and Helen Scott are in partnership in the women's tandem events.

Crystal Lane, Lora Turnham (piloted by Lauryn Therin) and World Championships debutants Megan Giglia, Steve Bate (piloted by Adam Duggleby), Louis Rolfe and Jaco van Gass complete the team.

Britain topped the medal table at the 2014 event in Aguascalientes, Mexico, winning 10 medals, seven of them gold.
