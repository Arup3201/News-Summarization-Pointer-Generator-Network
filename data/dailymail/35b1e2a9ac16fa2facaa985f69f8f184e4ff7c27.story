A talented athlete has died weeks after being diagnosed with a rare cancer that affects people who have had an organ transplant. 

David Acott had a transplant three years ago after doctors discovered his liver was not metabolising copper and he was being poisoned.

He recovered so well that he had taken up competing in tough triathlons and regularly went running with his mother.

But the popular 17-year-old student was told he had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in January - a devastating cancer that affects the white blood cells in around one in 50 people.

Medical staff were initially confident that chemotherapy would cure him.

But he failed to respond to treatment and died on Monday surrounded by family.

His mother Janet, from Bodham, Norfolk, said last night: 'David had a strength and depth that just amazed me.

'He was kind, good-natured, had a lovely smile, was very well-mannered, and caring and considerate to his younger brother Howard - they were best friends.'

The 48-year-old added that David had become her friend as well as her son over the last couple of years.

She said: 'We would walk and run together - he was someone who was really nice to hang out with and we are all going to miss him so much.'

Hundreds of tributes from fellow athletes and friends have also been paid to David, who attended Paston College, North Walsham.

Sheringham Parkrun athletes fell silent for a minute before their weekly event on Saturday as David often ran it with his mum.

Karl Read, Parkrun director, said: 'David was a modest and very brave lad.

'He started walking on the run with his mum as part of rehabilitation, then began to run and ended up taking part in triathlons.

'He was a lovely guy who always had a smile.'

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a potentially fatal but uncommon complication of organ transplants.

The disease affects the white blood cells and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus.

Some of the cells affected may undergo mutations that render them malignant, giving rise to a lymphoma, or group of blood cell tumours.

There is no uniform consensus regarding the best treatment for the disease. Antiviral drugs can be used as can chemotherapy in more serious cases.

It is mainly fatal in cases where it progresses to a lymphoma.  

Around one in 50 people develop the disease after surgery.

Kevin Grieve, Paston College principal, said: 'We are very saddened by the news.

'David was a hard-working and diligent student.

'It is a very sad loss and we have been supporting staff and students, particularly those who were on the same course.'

David began to suffer from depression and anxiety when he was 13 years old.

Shortly after his 15th birthday in July 2012 Ms Acott spotted that his stomach looked swollen. Two days later the whites of his eyes turned yellow and he became very ill.

Within a week, David was having a life-saving liver transplant in King's College Hospital, London, after being diagnosed with the rare Wilson's Disease.

His family learned that a genetic defect had caused the illness, which prevented his liver from being able to metabolise copper. The deadly copper build-up was poisoning his liver, brain and other organs.

Within weeks of the operation David was well enough to jog more than three miles with his mum.

Ms Acott, who has now become one of the Parkrun organisers, said: 'We basically walked most of it the first time but it was such an achievement.'

The keen athlete also began running, swimming and playing badminton.

He took part in the 2013 Pinewood Triathlon in Sheringham and won three medals in last year's British Transplant Games in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

He loved playing football and supported his native Ipswich Town as well as sharing the family passion for Arsenal.

Ms Acott, a former teacher at Beeston Hall where her partner Richard Hamilton teaches, said: 'David had been lost in his illness but for two-and-a-half really good years I had my real son - and he was an absolute joy for me and the whole family.

'He was a really lovely boy.'

In 2013 he travelled to the United States with his family where they visited Central Park (above). From left to right: mother Janet Acott, brother Howard, Ms Acott's partner Richard Hamilton and David

David also had a younger brother - Howard, 14 - and a half-sister - Clare, eight.

And he adored the family cocker spaniel, ironically named Copper by David long before he knew he had Wilson's Disease.

In the last couple of years he travelled to the United States with his family  and went to watch the Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in Portugal last May, courtesy of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

While there David was thrilled to meet former Arsenal and France star Robert Pires.

The brave teenager had recently started a creative media course.

Ms Acott said she had been 'deeply touched' at the support shown by his friends there.

They had managed to get an Ipswich shirt signed by the club's players to boost his morale.

Although David never saw it, Ms Acott said she told him about it as he lay dying in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and he had smiled with pleasure.

She said: 'He definitely had a very good two-and-a-half years thanks to the selfless act of organ donation. David never complained - he just got on with it.

'Even when they were sticking needles in him and prodding him about, he always said thank you to the nurses.'  

Ms Acott is still organising David's funeral and hopes lots of his friends will attend.

She will be asking for donations, instead of flowers, to the Ronald McDonald House Charity, Camberwell House, which provided accommodation and support for the family while David was at King's College Hospital.
