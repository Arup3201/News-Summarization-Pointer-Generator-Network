Training: Army ranger Michael Maguire, 21, was hit by a stray bullet while standing in a designated safe zone during a training exercise at Castlemartin Ranges in West Wales

A popular tourist beach may have been sprayed with bullets during a botched army training exercise in which a soldier was shot dead.

Machine gun fire was directed towards Freshwater West beach in West Wales, located outside a seaside resort.

Michael 'Mike' Maguire, 21, was hit in the temple by a single bullet last May while standing in a designated zone at Castlemartin training ranges where the Army trains recruits.

The beach, which is well known to surfers, is 
situated less than one and a half miles (2.4km) away from from the area.

An inquest into the Army ranger's death heard evidence today 
suggesting that civilians who may have been relaxing there could also have been hit.

Soldiers at the shooting ranges are 
put through highly realistic exercises designed to be as close to battle
conditions as possible.

Rifles, machine guns and hand 
grenades are used in what are supposed to be 
strictly controlled conditions.

Ranger Maguire, originally from County Cork, Ireland, who was a member of the 1st Battalion, was hit by a bullet thought to have been fired from 0.6 miles (1km) away.

He was standing in a safe zone beyond where live fire training was taking place having just finished an exercise himself.

An inquest jury in Cardiff has previously been to the sprawling series of shooting ranges to see where the tragedy happened.

They have heard that soldiers shoot out to sea and within specific map co-ordinates that restrict firing to a narrow channel.

Evidence suggests a fellow soldier firing a machine gun at a designated target placed on the range hit ranger Maguire.

Captain Gary Palmer, an Army weapons expert, investigated the tragedy in parallel with the police to ensure later recruits were trained safely.

He said that soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Jonathan Price had shot outside the safe areas specified, in particular an area designed to ensure bullets were no danger to other soldiers.

Ranger Maguire, relaxing 0.6 miles (1km) away without his protective helmet and armour, fell within the range, while other soldiers on similar live fire exercises were also likely to have been unwittingly shot at.

Freshwater Beach was also within the same potentially deadly area, with Captain Palmer saying the 'full weapon danger area' for the machine gun was 1.8 miles (2.9km).

Vale of Glamorgan Coroner Mary Hassall said: 'It is about 2.5 kilometres to the beach from Tenby, therefore by pointing north west the general purpose machine gun (GPMG) was within the full weapon danger area.

'That means a bullet could go from the gun to Freshwater beach.'

Capt Palmer replied: 'Yes. If it had clear line of sight without hitting anything on the way. Very plainly within the full weapon danger area of the range.'

Miss Hassall asked Captain Palmer: 'But how could someone get this so wrong?'

He said that he had never investigated
such an error and could not explain it, adding: 'The assumption here 
must be purely disorientation.'

The Visit Pembrokeshire website describes the beach, which has featured in a number of films, as 'a surfers’ paradise'.

The inquest has previously heard that the officer in charge on the day of the death had been recommended for supervision.

Lieutenant Price had passed a training course allowing him to plan and carry out live fire strategic training exercises.

Examiners on the course, completed nine months before Ranger Maguire’s death, advised he should receive 'increased levels of supervision'.

In evidence earlier this week Lt Price, the range conducting officer (RCO), dismissed a suggestion he failed to take on the responsibilities of a RCO.

He insisted that he had carried out his duties safely and had understood what he was doing.

He claimed to be unaware of the supervision advice. Officers either pass or fail a course. He had been passed, the inquest heard.

The inquest, which is scheduled to run for up to three weeks, continues.
