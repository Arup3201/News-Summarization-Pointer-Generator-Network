Sky Sports has been accused of sexism again after it cut short its coverage of the FA Women's Cup final coverage - robbing viewers of a nail-biting result.

The clash between Birmingham City Ladies and Chelsea Ladies was suddenly switched during extra time to the build-up between the men's League One play-off final.

Viewers missed a remarkable turnaround from Birmingham, who were 2-1 down with just eight minutes of extra time left when Sky switched its coverage.

Cut short: Birmingham City Ladies celebrate winning the FA Women's Cup Final after beating Chelsea Ladies FC in a penalty shootout at Ashton Gate, Bristol, on Saturday

A last minute equaliser by Birmingham made it 2-2, before a tense penalty shootout which the ladies from the Midlands won 3-2.

Furious fans took to Twitter after the match to brand the decision to axe the coverage sexist.

Lorraine Fell tweeted: 'Sky is SEXIST Not showing pens for women's FA cup going to play off.' And Luke Mackay tweeted the chant: 'Sky Sports...WERE SEXIST AND WE KNOW IT.'

Mike Maybury, Birmingham City's secretary, told the Birmingham Mail: 'It was disappointing that Sky stopped broadcasting the game before it was finished.

'Sky had taken the contract to air it, they should have fulfilled their obligation.'

He added: 'The match on Sky was a good advertisement for women’s football, which is another reason it’s so disappointing that it was not aired to the end of the game.'

But Sky Sports blamed the blunder on 'exceptional scheduling issues'.

A spokesman said: ‘Sky Sports covered the Women's FA Cup Final live in full but due to exceptional scheduling issues we had to cover the climax through the red button service rather than on Sky Sports 2.

‘The build up and match were shown live on the main channel. We then cut the build up to the League 1 Play-off Final so that we could show extra time in full.

‘With the match stretching to penalties the decision was made to switch to the red button. It was a difficult scheduling decision, caused by the wealth of live sport shown at the same time across five Sky Sports channels.

‘However, this did mean that we could cover the climax live. Viewers could also see extensive highlights at 6.15pm and coverage on Sky Sports News.’

The controversy is just the latest allegation to hit the broadcaster, after pundits Andy Gray and Richard Keys last year mocked assistant referee Sian Massey.

The pair believed their microphones had been switched off when they were heard questioning if she knew the offside rule.

Gray was axed after a video clip emerged of him asking co-presenter Charlotte Jackson to help tuck his microphone down his trousers during an advertising break. It was the third tape to emerge in three days.

Keys resigned later after an off-air clip of him was posted on YouTube, in which he referred to a woman as 'it' while twice asking Jamie Redknapp if he ‘smashed it’ [slang for ‘did you have sex with her?’].
