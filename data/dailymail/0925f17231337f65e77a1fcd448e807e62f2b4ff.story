Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly will no longer be undergoing surgery to treat his recently returned oral cancer.

Doctors said the aggressive cancer is ‘very treatable and potentially curable,’ but that surgery is not the optimal treatment for the former Buffalo Bills star.

Kelly, who is being treated at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, will instead undergo radiation and chemotherapy due to the ‘complexity and aggressive nature of his cancer,’ his wife Jill said.

Writing on her Facebook page, Mrs Kelly said: ‘At this point and time surgery is not the best option for Jim.

‘Because of complexity and aggressive nature of this cancer and after more scans and tests, the plan has changed.

‘At this point, Jim will not be having surgery. The cancer is in areas that surgery cannot successfully eradicate.

‘Therefore,
 the medical specialists here in NYC along with our Buffalo team believe
 that chemotherapy and radiation are the best option.’

The
 news of the change in treatment comes as the football player's 
daughter, Erin Kelly, posted two heartbreaking pictures of her dad.

Heartbreaking: In another picture, Kelly is seen walking in a hospital ward. 'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote

In one, she's sitting with Kelly on 
his hospital bed. The comment reads: 'Watching the Syracuse game with 
daddy... he's my buddy! Love him so much!!'

In another, Kelly is seen walking, assisted, in his hospital ward.

'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote.

Kelly's
 wife Jill revealed earlier this month that her husband's cancer had 
come back, eight months after he had part of his jaw and some teeth 
removed.

She wrote on her personal blog late last week that 'the cancer's back, aggressive, and starting to spread.'

Buffalo: Kelly, shown left at 1992's Super Bowl, spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home

The Erie County Medical Center in 
Buffalo reiterated the sad news in a statement, adding that the cancer 
was found when the former Buffalo Bills star came in for follow-up 
testing after last June's oral surgery.

The
 statement said the hospital's head and neck cancer specialists were 
determining a course of treatment. Thursday's surgery will be the first 
step.

Kelly spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home and last week, former teammates Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, and Andre Reed visited the former quarterback.

Kelly and his family have asked that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers.

The cancer battle is not the first tragedy for the family. Kelly's son, Hunter, was born with Krabbe disease, an inherited nervous system disorder. Given little more than three years to live, Hunter died at the age of 8 in 2005.
