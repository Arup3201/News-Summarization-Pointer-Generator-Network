The pregnant daughter of a millionaire was kicked in the stomach by a burglar during an armed raid on their family home.

Katie Stiff was with her mother Catherine and younger sister Chloe, when a masked intruder stormed their home in Epsom, Surrey, armed with a gun.

Katie's father, entrepreneur Robert, said the burglar who targeted his family was a 'coward', and had inflicted so much sadness in to their lives at a time when they should have been great joy.

'That is probably the most upsetting part, with Katie being pregnant at a time when we should have been celebrating there was so much sadness in the house,' Mr Stiff told BBC Crimewatch.

'He is a coward.'

Thankfully Katie is due to give birth next month. 

Former soldier Mr Stiff, 54, was born in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and moved to Britain in 1978.

He is a patron of the Prince's Trust and sold his healthcare recruitment company Team24, to the Capita Group, for more than £25 million in May 2011.

He was at work when the masked man entered his six-bedroom gated home, close to the Kingswood Golf and Country Club, at around 5.40pm on November 12.

Surrey Police, who will make a Crimewatch television appeal about the aggravated burglary tonight, said all three were also viciously kicked in their sides and it was especially traumatic for Katie who is due to give birth in February. 

Mr Stiff's youngest daughter Chloe (pictured) described the attack on the family as 'traumatic', but added: 'It's the after-effects of what he's left behind that's even worse'

He forced the women to removed and hand over their expensive jewellery, before assaulting them and fleeing with the jewels and several watches. 

The family was also forced to lie down before they were tied up, and the women were ordered to open a safe where more high-value jewellery was stolen.

'[The intruder] went to Katie and he booted her in the side of her tummy where she's pregnant,' said Mrs Stiff in the televised appeal.

'And he booted her one, and I just thought: "Oh god, what's going to happen to that baby?"'

Chloe added: 'Because, although what happened on that night was traumatic, it's the after-effects of what he's left behind that's even worse.' 

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Antony Archibald, will also feature on the programme and is appealing to anyone who has information which could assist the investigation to share this with officers. 

Mr Stiff is a patron of the Prince's Trust and sold his healthcare recruitment company Team24, to the Capita Group, for more than £25 million

'This was a horrifying ordeal for the family involved, they believed they were going to come to some serious harm, it is every family's worst nightmare,' he said.

'The family's eldest daughter is expecting their first grandchild and was heavily pregnant at the time of the offence; this did not seem to affect the intruder, who kicked her and her mother and sister in the stomach even after they had given in to his demands.

'They were fully compliant throughout the incident.

'In the time which has past, I believe the offender will have confided in someone about the offence but he probably failed to mention that he violently assaulted a pregnant woman.

'If you are this person, please come forward and speak with us.'

He added: 'I believe the family was specifically targeted because the burglars had very detailed demands and I am sure someone will be able to piece all of these pieces together and provide us with a name for the offender.

'I would also urge anyone who has been offered any of the stolen items for sale or who knows a person who has suddenly come into possession of such an item and has their suspicions about them to provide information.

'Someone, somewhere knows who is responsible for the appalling attack and I would urge them to contact police.'

Anyone with information on this incident is urged to contact East Surrey CID on 01483 631239 quoting Op Vesuvius. Information can be passed to the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 where you may be eligible for a reward if your evidence leads to the arrest and conviction of a person responsible.

Crimewatch is due to be broadcast at 9pm on BBC1.
