There is no more important subject in the world at this moment. I do not know a single person who is not appalled and frightened in equal measure by the spread of Islamic fanaticism, especially the seemingly unstoppable rise of the ragbag gang of murderers known as Islamic State (IS).

In addition it makes most of us rage as well as weep that young people who have known all the advantages of living in Britain (and make no mistake, there are many, no matter how much victimhood-type whinging goes on) should head off to a pitiless desert in the hope of building a so-called ‘Caliphate’.

Oh, and of course, being permitted to have sex with those 72 legendary virgins in paradise — once glorious martyrdom is achieved through murdering ‘kuffars’. Which means us.

Zak Ebrahim (his adopted name) and his father El Sayyid Nosair, who shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defence League in New York

On one level it is pathetic, absurd. On another, truly repulsive.

We may loathe and fear this mind-set, yet we must still seek to be informed about it. (I hesitate to use the word, ‘understand’ since that seems a step too far.)

You have to know the enemy in order to wage war –— and is there any doubt that this is war? That’s why these two timely books are — each in a different way — essential reading.

One is a short account of how the son of a terrorist has eschewed his father and now devotes his life to preaching an alternative message.

The other provides a lucid and vividly written background that reveals much about the Islamic terrorist mind-set.

When Zak Ebrahim (his adopted name) was just seven, his father, El Sayyid Nosair, shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defence League in New York.

Nosair began to ‘pore endlessly over the Qur’an’ and attended ‘mysterious meetings’ and became withdrawn from his family

On November 5, 1990 the little boy in Mutant Ninja Turtle pyjamas experienced the end of his childhood. His father ‘was the first known Islamic jihadist to take life on American soil’, and worked with the support of a terror cell overseas that would ultimately call itself Al Qaeda.

Ebrahim’s mother was a Catholic American who lost her faith, found Islam — and very quickly married an Egyptian immigrant to whom she had spoken about two words.

The couple were ‘happy for a time’, and even though he has repudiated his father, Ebrahim does have some joyful memories of time with him. They were few.

For Nosair began to ‘pore endlessly over the Qur’an’ and attended ‘mysterious meetings’ and became withdrawn from his family.

This pattern is one we have read about again and again, when Muslims are ‘radicalised’. After Nosair’s incarceration, Ebrahim’s family moved more than 20 times, and the children were bullied mercilessly at school for their father’s notoriety.

But life was to become far worse. Ebrahim’s mother had always believed in her husband’s innocence — until after the explosion in the underground car park of the World Trade Centre in 1993, which killed six innocent people, including a pregnant woman. It emerged that Nosair was one of those who had organised this, from his prison cell. Astounded and repelled, his hitherto gullible wife sought a divorce.

After a deeply unhappy adolescence, Zak found a job at a theme park in Florida where the racial and religious diversity of the visitors opened his eyes to a world of tolerance. ‘From the moment I put on my Rhino Rally safari suit, I meet tourists and co-workers of every description, which is so liberating that I can hardly put the feeling into words,’ he writes.

In one of his infamous video messages, Osama Bin Laden urged his followers to ‘Remember El Sayyid Nosair’. Nosair’s adult son has done just that, but not in the way that brainwashed jihadis would like. His choice has been to turn his back on the extremism that might have been his legacy and argue against it in public.

He explains that ‘. . .turning someone into a bigot is the first step in turning him into a terrorist. You find someone vulnerable — someone who’s lost his confidence, his income, his pride, his agency. Someone who feels humiliated by life. You fill him with fear and fury, and you see to it that he regards anybody who’s different as a faceless target . . .’

A Children of Al Qaeda extremist totes a gun

Now, Zak Ebrahim acts as a brave and inspiring ambassador for reason, tolerance and choice.

You only wish he could visit every school in Muslim-dominated areas of this country and ‘offer myself up as proof that it is possible to shut one’s ears to hatred and violence and simply choose peace’.

Of Nosair he says simply: ‘He chose terrorism over fatherhood . . . My father chose terrorism over me.’

Another important book in today’s climate is Path Of Blood, subtitled, The Story Of Al Qaeda’s War On The House Of Saud.

In taking us back to Bin Laden’s aim to conquer his home country, Saudi Arabia, it throws invaluable light on the current situation in Iraq and Syria.

The schisms and divisions within Islam can be confusing for the general reader, but with its glossary and ‘cast-list’, Path Of Blood serves to clarify history in the making.

C urrently there are 10,000 foreign fighters in Syria, many affiliated with Al Qaeda — which, do not forget, denounced the extremism of IS.

But like IS, Al Qaeda was able to lure impressionable young men by a mixture of religious rhetoric and a promise of fleshpots in heaven.

The authors tell a vivid story of how a campaign of kidnappings, shootings and bombings was launched across Saudi Arabia and how the royal family fought back.

The book is a salutary reminder of how pitifully undisciplined, fragmented and lacking in intelligence and expertise the terrorists were — yet at the same time how ruthless and dangerous.

For example, a skilled bomb-maker had no compunction about turning his pitiful special–needs brother into a suicide bomber in an attempt to assassinate Prince Muhammad of the Saudi royal family.

Next year a film with the same title will be released, drawing on extensive research, interviews and video footage captured from Al Qaeda safe houses — all material which is in this book.

Most important, for me, was the insight gained into the workings of Saudi society, and the realisation that the country’s on-going role in ‘the war on terror’ has not been fully understood.

Whatever we may think of their authoritarian, conservative and patriarchal customs, we need the House of Saud on our side.
