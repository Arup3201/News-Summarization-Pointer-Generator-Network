A young boy filmed a shark swimming in the shallows of a popular tourist beach in Corsica.

Grabbing his father's mobile phone, the boy dashed to the water's edge to capture the footage, showing the shark swimming just metres away from him.

The sighting comes just days after beaches were closed in both the South of France and Spain - near Barcelona - following blue shark sightings.

Referring to himself simply as Chihab, the father of the boy told Le Parisien newspaper: 'Its body was very thin. It looked a bit listless and really disorientated. It wasn't at all aggressive.'

Hi wife Annabella added: 'The Corsicans couldn't believe us at first. Fortunately we had the video as proof.'

The animal has been identified as a blue shark, the same species that has also closed other beaches in both France and Spain in recent days.

Spanish lifeguards shut six beaches in and around Barcelona after spotting three blue sharks of up to 1.5m long swimming close to the shore.

Swimming was also banned at several beaches in the South of France last Wednesday, including Canet Plage near Perpignan, after a number of blue shark sightings.

Holiday spot: The blue shark was spotted near the beaches on the popular island of Corsica

Attacks on
 humans by blue sharks are very rare and of the nine that have been 
recorded, most involved divers who had been fishing and had attached 
their catch to their belts.

However,
 it is considered extremely unusual to spot the sharks so close to the 
shore and experts are concerned they could have followed fishing boats 
into the shallows, which would mean they are in feeding mode.

Richard Peirce, chairman of the Shark Trust, told The Telegraph: 'If I had a beach full of people I would probably close it. If they follow a fishing boat in they are in the feeding mode, and the last thing you really want them to do is swim around people.'

Common sight: Blue sharks can be found in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic, but are not normally so close to beaches

However, he reassured holidaymakers that blue sharks are a common Mediterranean and North Atlantic species.

Beaches
 in France and Spain have now reopened, but French authorities warned 
swimmers to exercise caution following the sightings.

The Spanish beaches in and around the Barcelona area that were closed included Ocata, Ponent, Masnou, Descàrrega, Bellamar, and Pla de l’Os, but they have since been reopened.

Blue sharks have also been spotted off the coast of Brittany in France this month.
