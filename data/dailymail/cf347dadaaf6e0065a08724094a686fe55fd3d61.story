Stressed: Parents and carers - who already have the right to ask for flexible working - could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities

Britain's 30million workers will have the right to demand flexible hours from Monday – even if they just want a lie-in or time off to pursue a hobby.

They will not have to give a reason why they want to be off at certain times and companies have been told they cannot judge requests on merit.

It means parents and carers – who already have the right to ask for flexible working – could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities.

A request from a mother who wants to start work later so she can take her children to nursery will carry no more weight than one from a colleague simply wanting to spend a bit longer in bed.

Bosses expect to be hit with a deluge of requests which must be considered in the order received.

Astonishingly, government officials have told business groups that if employers receive conflicting requests which they cannot honour they should ‘put the names in a hat’.

Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said  the new rules meant that those with stronger claims to flexible working could lose out.

He said: ‘The new rules make it harder for employers to prioritise requests. They cannot prioritise one employee over another, whereas before you could prioritise those who had childcare responsibilities or carer responsibilities  for example.’

When the measures were first announced by Nick Clegg in November 2012, businesses warned they would lead to more red tape.

Many firms already offer flexible terms, but there are fears that the new rules could lead to a string of legal actions. There are also  concerns that the ‘right to ask’ for flexible working will be confused with a ‘right to have’.

Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘Our members recognise the benefits of flexible working and wherever possible have sought to work with employees to provide flexible working options.

‘However, extending the right to request flexible working to all employees will simply make the consideration process the employer needs to follow more complicated and time-consuming and only add to the administrative pressures already felt by many small business owners.’

Flexible working laws were first introduced in 2003. Currently they mean firms must consider requests from parents with children under 17 and from those with caring responsibilities for elderly parents or other dependents.

But from Monday, all workers will have the same ‘right to ask’ after they have been in a job for six months.

They can make one request a year and businesses can only refuse under eight specific reasons, such as if the change creates additional costs or does not fit with customer demand.Employees who are unhappy with the decision can appeal.

Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said: ‘Extending the right to request flexible working will help to create a cultural shift towards more modern, 21st century workplaces where working flexibly is the norm.

‘Firms that embrace flexible working are more likely to attract and retain the best talent and  reap the benefits of a more motivated workforce.

‘Employees will benefit from being able to balance work with other commitments in their lives. It also helps drive a cultural shift where flexible working becomes the norm.’
