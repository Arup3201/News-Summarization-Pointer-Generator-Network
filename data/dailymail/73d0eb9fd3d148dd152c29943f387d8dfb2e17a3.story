Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has blasted the Obama administration for bringing the world to the brink of 'a second Cold War that nobody needs.'

In a videotaped interview published Tuesday, he told Bloomberg Television that 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second cold war,' in part because President Barack Obama 'could be more tactful politically.'

Seated at his private residence outside Moscow and speaking through an English translator, Medvedev blasted Obama for leveling sanctions at the Russian government and its wealthiest oligarchs.

Nerves fraying: Russia claims it has withdrawn troops from near the Ukrainian border, but tank commanders at checkpoints are still standing guard

Naive? Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov pressed a red prop 'reset button' along with then- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, but the two countries' relations are now at a post-Cold War low

'Let's be 
honest: Those sanctions are a sharp knife for European business,' he claimed. 'And 
American business doesn't need them either. The only ones who want 
sanctions are politicians, who use them to reinforce their convictions 
and demonstrate their power.'

And in a mafia-like jab, the Russian legislative leader hinted that if he wanted to, he could push back against U.S. sanctions.

'You've probably noticed that we have not commented on them a great deal or responded to them harshly,' he told Bloomberg reporter Ryan Chilcote, 'although we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions.'

Asked about the now-infamous 'reset button' effort that he co-engineered with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March 2009, Medvedev said the Obama administration has unraveled any Russian good will that may have existed five years ago.

'Yes, I believe that President Obama could be more tactful politically when discussing those issues,' he said. 'Some decisions taken by the U.S. administration are disappointing.'

Medvedev hinted at repercussions for U.S. economic sanctions, saying that 'we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions'

'We have indeed done a lot for Russian-U.S. relations. I believe doing so was right. The agreements that we reached with America were useful. And I'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved is now being eliminated by those [U.S.] decisions.'

'Basically,' he claimed, 'we are slowly but surely approaching a second Cold War that nobody needs. Why am I saying this? Because a competent politician knows how to make reserved, careful, subtle, wise and intelligent decisions –  which, I believe, Mr Obama succeeded at for a while.'

'But what is being done now, unfortunately, proves that the US Administration has run out of these resources. And the United States is one of the parties to suffer from this.'

Medvedev's interview came as the U.S. was still seeking 'firm evidence' to support Russia's claim that it has withdrawn soldiers from the borders of Ukraine.

Ukraine is gearing up for an election to replace former president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of street protests.

Russia's relations with the United States and European Union are at a post-Cold War low following Moscow's seizure of Crimea.
