Scotland's could have its own time zone under plans to move the UK to Central European Time.

The campaign to shift the UK forward an hour, aligning the nation with most of Europe, is supported by a wide range of MPs, who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight.

Scotland has been opposed to the change in the past, but campaigners say Westminster could devolve powers allowing Scots to set their own time.

Scotland could have a different time zone if the plans, which would see the rest of the UK move to Central European Time, are approved

The proposal, which has been submitted to William Hague, has been kicked into the long grass in the past because of a lack of Scottish support for shorter daylight hours and darker mornings.

But Tom Mullarkey, chief executive of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said that allowing Scotland to stick with the norm while the UK changes time zone was a possibility.

In a letter to Mr Hague, who is the leader of the Commons and is chairing a government committee on devolving powers to Holyrood, Mr Mullarkey said the change could save 80 lives and prevent hundreds of injuries.

According to The Times, he wrote: 'Paradoxically, there seems to be more political resistance to this proposed change in Scotland, which stands to gain disproportionately from the initiative, although the majority of people in Scotland do not appear to be against it.

'However, In England, where the appetite for change is greater still, many more people are killed and injured because of the time zone misalignment that both countries suffer. 

'It is the perceived resistance in Scotland that is causing so many lives to be lost and diminished across the UK, and this could be a prime opportunity for the two governments to make thier decisions on this issue independently.'

Yesterday it was announced that the drink drive limit will be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5 in Scotland, but not England and Wales

Edmund King, president of the AA, also backed the move, but said it would come with 'practical difficulties'.

He said: 'Our view is that it would be best if it was changed in England and Wales to see the benefits and then the Scots can decide for themselves.

'It would be slightly awkward, though, if you had difference opening hours in Scotland and England. There might be practical difficulties.' 

The move is largely driven by road safety, which Scotland already assumes powers for.

Yesterday Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill announced plans to cut the drink-drive limit north of the border by Christmas.

The blood alcohol limit will be reduced from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from December 5.

It would bring Scotland in line with the rest of Europe, but would mean the limit is lower than that in England and Wales.
