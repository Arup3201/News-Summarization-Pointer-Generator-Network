Kelvin Davis had gone almost 15 months since his last appearance in the Barclays Premier League but Ronald Koeman thinks it was worth the wait.

Part of a Southampton team boasting Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana, and managed by Mauricio Pochettino, Davis let in three against Chelsea that day in January 2014.

Yet on Saturday, like a blast from the past, the 38-year-old goalkeeper became the fourth oldest player to feature this season. He did so with gusto, earning a round of applause from his team-mates as he entered the dressing room afterwards.

Southampton have benefited from more opposition own goals than any other Premier League team this season (5).

His appearance came in unfortunate circumstances. An injury to Fraser Forster's left knee that will almost certainly rule the goalkeeper out of England's internationals this month called for Davis to wipe the dust off his gloves.

There is no reason to panic as far as Koeman is concerned. He has a man he deems reliable and professional enough, both behind the scenes as club captain and on the pitch, to fill the void.

Koeman was 51 on Saturday and, while Shane Long and an own goal from Burnley's Jason Shackell provided the victory, the Southampton manager's birthday gift was in no short part down to the man 13 years his junior.

'I was not surprised because we see Kelvin working every day in the training session,' Koeman said. 'That's important to have somebody when he has to play that he has some confidence. That he will not be nervous.

'His situation is clear. Fraser is first and Kelvin is the second goalkeeper. You need a lot of experience when you need to play and you have to show it.

'That's difficult but he showed his quality. He was looking very comfortable and that gave confidence to the rest of the team. He's not the youngest goalkeeper but still he's a very good goalkeeper. He's a very good professional.'

Davis still has some way to go before catching Leicester City's 42-year-old reserve goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer but he made the most appearances for Southampton in League One four seasons ago, having joined the Saints in 2006, and rolled back the years on Saturday.

Davis denied Sam Vokes and Danny Ings with full-length saves, and gave Koeman hope that losing Forster will not hamper the club that have conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League this season. Burnley tested them, but European football remains a possibility.

Koeman was not oblivious to his former club Barcelona's win in the Champions League against Manchester City last week, yet he refuses to imagine himself taking Southampton to the Nou Camp.

'We don't think too much about the Champions League. We hope seventh place on the table means European football, and that will be fantastic for us,' said Koeman.

'The Champions League is amazing to play in and amazing to be involved in. We know our situation, we know our qualities. If it's Europa League, that will be great for us.'
