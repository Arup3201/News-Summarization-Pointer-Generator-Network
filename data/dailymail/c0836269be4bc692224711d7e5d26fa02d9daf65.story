Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny has conceded his side were beaten by Chelsea's 'brilliance' on Sunday, but maintains he is satisfied with the Gunners' start to the season.

Goals from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa sealed a 2-0 win for the Blues at Stamford Bridge - keeping them five points clear at the top and nine above Arsenal - with Szczesny admitting that Jose Mourinho's side's individual class shone through in the end. 

Szczesny told reporters: 'I thought it was a very even game but Chelsea have an ability to keep clean sheets at home and I thought they were very good, they took their chances with two brilliant moments.

'One, the brilliant run from [Eden] Hazard that led to the penalty. On the second goal, the ball from Cesc [Fabregas] and the finish. Sometimes you've got to take your hat off to the brilliance of the opposition.

'We've had a tough run so far. But I'd like to think that our start has been solid, not as good as we expected from ourselves but I believe that, after the international break, we can push on and get more points.

'You can't say we've played badly against Chelsea, it's just that we've come up against a very strong side, probably the favourites to win the Premier League at this point.'

Arsene Wenger's side find themselves eighth in the Premier League currently with 10 points from their opening seven games whereas Chelsea lead the pack with a comfortable five-point cushion, with 19 points overall.
