Struggling through: More people are dragging themselves to work despite being ill, a survey found

The days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to get a day off are over, a survey has found, as workers fear 'pulling a sickie' could get them the sack.

People are now so concerned about job security they will trudge into work even when genuinely ill to underline their commitment to the job.

The survey by Fisherman’s Friend found that half of workers had not taken a single day off sick so far in 2011 because of cold or flu, despite actually being ill at least three times.

The average number of days taken off sick due to such illnesses is now just two days a year, half the number compared to three years ago.

This fall in cold and flu absenteeism means that such illnesses are estimated to have cost the UK a mere £4.6 billion in 2011, compared with more than £9 billion three years ago.

Workers’ top two reasons for battling on even when ill were ‘concerns over job security’ and ‘not wanting to let colleagues down’, which together polled more than 90 per cent of the vote.

'Our survey makes interesting reading because the figures show the difference in workers’ attitudes to sickness and job security in just three short years,'said Rob Metcalfe, spokesman for Fisherman’s Friend.

Pressures: Out of the 1,000 people surveyed 90 per cent said they would go into work despite being ill as they were concerned about job security

'When we carried out our last study, fears over job security were not a strong factor, but we are now several years into the economic downturn, and with warnings of even tougher times ahead no one wants to be singled out as a weak link at work'

Workers aged between 25 and 34 were found to have had the greatest number of colds and days off in 2011, three apiece, possibly due to hectic lifestyles that revolve around work and play, leaving them more exposed to illnesses such as the common cold.

People in the North East were found to 
have had the most colds, an average of three, while those living and 
working in Northern Ireland have had the fewest, just two.

Pulling a sickie: The days of exaggerating cold and flu symptoms to have a day at home are over

Workers in Scotland, Wales and the South West took the least time off when ill in 2011, with more than two thirds from each region declining to take a single day off for a cold or flu.

Meanwhile, the only major difference between men and women still appears to be their perception of how ill they really are when suffering with a cold or flu.

Out of 1,000 people surveyed three quarters of men claimed they genuinely thought they suffered when they were ill more than women.
