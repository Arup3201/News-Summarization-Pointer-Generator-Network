A 34-year-old former dental receptionist has been remanded in custody on a racial harassment charge after video showing her allegedly 
abusing passengers aboard a tram while balancing a toddler on her knee 
appeared on the internet.

Emma West of New Addington, London, appeared before magistrates this morning charged with racially aggravated harassment following an appeal by the British Transport Police.

She was remanded in custody on Monday night 'for her own protection', after complaints were made in relation to the footage uploaded to YouTube.

Charged: Police launched an appeal after video appeared on the internet showing a woman apparently abusing tram passengers while 
balancing a toddler on her knee

Following an appearance at Croydon Magistrates Court, West was kept in custody over fears of 'revenge attacks' after the video of her rant swept the internet.

Her arrest followed an appeal by the 
British Transport officers who asked the media to publicise the video to
 help identify her.

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'This is in relation to an incident onboard a Croydon Tramlink.'

The video, posted on YouTube, shows a woman apparently hurling abuse 
at other passengers on the South London tram and making xenophobic insults.

The footage appears to have been discreetly captured by a passenger as the tram travelled from Croydon to Wimbledon.

The video is believed to have been filmed aboard a tram travelling between Croydon and Wimbledon

Throughout the two minutes of 
footage the woman's little boy sits nervously as his mother begins her rant.

At one point the woman declares other passengers should go back to their own country, saying they're not British because they are black.

Onlookers appear to be uncertain whether the woman is drunk while she is making the comments.Â 

The woman in the video says: 'None of you are ****ing English. Get back to your own country. Sort your own countries, don't come and do mine.

'It's nothing now. Britain is nothing now. Britain is **** all. My Britain is **** all.'

At one point she claims passengers in the 
carriage are '****ing burnt people.'

Already 10,000 members of the public have watched the film, after it was posted on Youtube, on Sunday, by LadyK89.

Fellow passengers watched on as the woman continued her foul-mouthed tirade

Comments by one viewer called 
The Specialscrew, read: 'As a white British male, I feel disgusted to 
even be associated with this woman by my race and nationality.'

Earlier the British Transport Police said: 'The video posted on YouTube 
and Twitter has been brought to our attention and our officers have 
launched an investigation.

'At present it is not entirely clear which tram stops the offence took place between and when it occurred.

'As a result we need anyone who 
witnessed this incident, or with any information that could assist our 
investigation - including the identity of the woman - to contact us.

'We will not tolerate racism in any 
form on the rail network and will do everything in our power to locate 
the person responsible.'

A spokeswoman for Transport for London 
(TfL), said: 'All of our customers have the right to use our services without fear of being abused.

'TfL will not tolerate disgusting
 and offensive behaviour and we will work with the police to fully 
investigate this incident.

'London Tramlink has a dedicated team 
of police officers who patrol the network and we would like to assure 
all our customers that we will continue to do everything we can to 
ensure that they can travel safely.

'We would appeal to whoever posted the video to contact us in confidence.'

The transcript of her rant 
reads: 'What has this country come to? A load of black people and a load
 of ****ing Polish. A load of ****ing, yeah... you're all ****ing... do 
you know what I mean?

'You ain't English. No, you ain't English either. 
You ain't English. None of you's ****ing English. Get back to your own ****ing... do you know what sort out your own countries, don't come and 
do mine.

'It's nothing now. Britain is nothing now. Britain is **** all. My Britain is **** all.

'Yeah its fine. I have got a little kid here. Have respect? I have a little boy here. **** you. I dare you, I ****ing dare you.

'Don't watch my language. Go back to 
where you come from, go back to ****ing Nicaragua or where ever you come
 from. Just ****ing go back.

'I work, I work, I work, this is my British country until we let you lot come over.

'So what. It is my British country, you ain't British. Are you British? You ain't ****ing British. **** off.

'You ain't British, you're black. 
Where do you come from?

'No, someone's got to talk up for these lot. 
Look the whole ****ing tram, look at them. Who is black and who is 
white.

'There is all black and ****ing burnt people.'
