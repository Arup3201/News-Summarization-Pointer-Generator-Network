A Sydney grandmother missing for two months in southern India has been found dead, with three men facing murder charges.

Indian police say her body has been exhumed and a guard at the apartment building where she was living has been arrested over her murder along with two of his friends. 

Inspector B. Venugopal said the men robbed Ms Ludgate of her money and jewellery, killed her and buried her body in a remote place about 15 kilometres from Puttaparti.

Ms Ludgate was on a regular trip to India doing charity work. She is said to have experienced a deep connection with ashram and spiritual master Sai Baba, who died in April 2011

She was reportedly last seen getting into a taxi with another woman on September 23 in the village of Puttaparthi, 125km north of Bangalore. 

The 75-year-old Pyrmont local went missing in August after arriving in India in July. 

She was on a regular trip to India doing charity work in an ashram when her family became concerned after they had lost all communications with her.

Ms Ludgate had been working serving breakfast and dinner at the Western Cantina in the Prasanthi Nilayam ashram.

Australian officials said on Saturday evening they were providing consular assistance to the family of Mrs Ludgate.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was assisting Ms Ludgate's family, and is understood to be liaising with Puttaparthi police in charge of the investigation as well as the commissioner of police in Bangalore.

DFAT told News Corp Australia earlier this week it was sending consular officials to Bangalore on the basis this was where Ms Ludgate was believed to have been headed. 

Her daughter, author Traci Harding, told Sydney's Daily Telegraph Indian police had been unable to find the cab driver and one of her mother's two mobile phones had received a couple of short calls, about one second each, since then.

Her daughter, best selling author Traci Harding, who last spoke to her mother on her birthday on August 28, said she was reportedly last seen getting out of a cab with an older lady on September 23.

'The landlord of the lodge she was staying at, had reported she paid an extra five days rent before leaving in a cab with an older lady in Bangalore. After that we never heard from her,' she said.

Ms Ludgate's bank account had also not been touched and her ticket home to Sydney  was found in the apartment.

'I think when she didn’t get back to unit there were alarm bells.'

'That part of India has recently been hit by a tornado, communications have been down, so there's a lot going on.'

Friends of Ms Ludgate at the Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Supreme Peace) ashram, where she regularly did volunteer work, have been on the case to find her since concerns were raised.

Ms Harding says they took up the case, followed up on leads and even got their legal team involved.

'They really have been fantastic,' she said.

She said they felt the crime scene, where her mother was last seen, had not been handled properly as the local authorities didn't have the capabilities to do an extensive search.

That's when the call for help came out, for higher authorities to get involved.

'DFAT Canberra have come to the party,' said Ms Harding. 

'Also a couple of days ago, Indian officers were notified and are seeking answers.'  

Earlier Ms Ludgate's family created a petition on change.org to persuade Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to ­approach the Indian government and try to get Indian federal police involved.  

'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people,' said Traci Harding (pictured right) of her mother Toni (pictured middle)

A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' was set up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward

A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' was also set up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward.

'Mum touched the lives of so many people, so we wanted to create somewhere for people to express their concerns, for people who knew her,' said Ms Harding.

'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people.'

While not knowing what happened to her mother, Ms Harding says she's trying not to panic and think positively that they will eventually find her.

'You can't just collapse into misery, your useless to everyone, I am dealing with it, like it is as a case.'

'There's been a huge outpouring of emotion from other people, which really gets you, but I've been dealing with it day by day and really staying calm,' she said.

'I hope we hear from her soon, that’s the hope.'
