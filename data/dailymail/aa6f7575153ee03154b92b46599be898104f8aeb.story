Former Texas Rep. and perennial presidential candidate Ron Paul may have let his son's campaign cat out of the bag on Friday, telling longtime TV host Larry King that his son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, is running for the White House in 2016.

'Yes, I think it's great he's doing it,' the elder Paul said on King's show 'PoliticKing,' produced by ORA.tv and broadcast on the RT (Russia Today) network.

'He has a good message and he understand free-market economics and I just think that its doing a world of good. But I also know the power and strength of the establishment and its a tough row to hoe.'

But a Rand Paul campaign insider familiar with the politician's decision-making told MailOnline hours later that his father got ahead of himself, saying that 'Senator Paul has not made a decision yet.'

The father-and-son team, both physicians, aren't the first to both make a bid for the U.S. presidency.

George H.W. Bush and his son, George W. Bush, both occupied the White House in the late 20th Century. John Adams and John Quincy Adams were America's second and sixth chief executives.

Ron Paul has run for the job three times, in 1988, 2008 and 2012. Two years ago he was the last Republican also-ran standing when former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney claimed the nomination to oppose President Barack Obama, claiming delegates in four states.

But on Friday his focus was on his son.

'I would never have discouraged him from doing it,' he said. 'Just like I didn't say "Rand, I really want to see you go to med school and be a doctor." But I never discourage and was delighted when he did go to med school and become an ophthalmologist.'

The younger Dr. Paul has made the political rounds in crucial early primary states, currying favor with members of state nominating committees and pressing the flesh with voters.

He is part of a presumed GOP field that includes Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. 

Baton pass: Rand Paul supported his father during the hotly contested Iowa caucuses in 2011, but their roles may be reversed in the coming two years

The Paul father-son duo would be the third to both run for the White House, after the Adamses and the Bushes
