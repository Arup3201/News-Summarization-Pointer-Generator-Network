A Lithuanian truck driver did a U-turn on the motorway in the middle of the rush hour - because he couldn't pay an £11 toll.

Police have released horrifying video footage of the incident last month on the M6 Toll in Staffordshire after the 51-year-old driver narrowly avoided jail for his actions.

Leonid Papachin had only been working in Britain for two months when he swung his 40-tonne lorry the wrong way up a slip road at junction T5, near Lichfield. 

Crazy trucker: This is the moment a Lithuanian lorry driver did a U-turn on the M6 Toll - because he had been unable to pay the £11 fee to leave the motorway. The incident last month was in the middle of the rush hour

Cannock Magistrates' Court heard he had tried to leave the toll motorway at 5.30pm on October 23, but his cash card was not accepted in a payment booth.

The Russian speaker attempted to use an intercom but could not make himself understood.

Eventually he opted to turn around and drive back up the exit slip road.

The Central Motorway Police Group saw the incident unfold on CCTV cameras and officers brought the lorry to a stop a short time later.

Papachin appeared in court with a Russian interpreter where he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving last month.

Footage: CCTV controllers could only watch as Leonid Papachin's white lorry turned back from the toll booths - where his payment card had been rejected - and drove back up the exit slip road onto the motorway

Approaching danger: The truck comes into sight of the motorway - though it remains on the hard shoulder

Perilous: Papachin, 51, takes his chance to swing out into the road as he attempts to turn his 40-tonne truck

Papachin, who lives in Lithuania, narrowly avoided jail over the incident and was handed a 15-week suspended sentence instead.

He was also banned from driving for 18 months and ordered to pay £85 costs. 

Chief Inspector Jed White, the manager of the regional motorway patrol, said: 'Unfortunately this type of incident is all too common on the motorway network, especially the M6 Toll, where drivers attempt to avoid charges for using the road.

'On this occasion the driver should have contacted motorway police immediately to help him manoeuvre safely.

'We will always prosecute offenders and, as this case demonstrates, the penalties can be quite severe.

'Our CCTV systems cover the majority of carriageways and are monitored 24/7, so there is no hiding place.

'I hope that it serves as a deterrent to anyone who thinks they can put other motorists in jeopardy by ignoring motorway regulations.' 

The M6 Toll opened in 2003 to relieve congestion in Birmingham and remains the only privately-run motorway in Britain, with fees ranging from £3 for a motorbike to £11 for an HGV.

Feat: Other drivers look on in horror as the lorry makes its manoeuvre across two of the three lanes of traffic

Success! The lorry pulls back into the lane - but it will be just minutes before he has a visit from traffic police

Penalty: The driver admitted dangerous driving and was banned from being behind the wheel for 18 months

Cheeky: The M6 Toll opened in 2003 to relieve congestion in Birmingham and remains Britain's only privately-run motorway. Police said it is common for drivers to try and evade the charges, which range from £3 to £11
