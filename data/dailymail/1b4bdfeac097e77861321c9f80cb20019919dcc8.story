A father and son who were filmed laughing as they encouraged their dogs to tear animals to shreds will be released from prison in just a few weeks after being given light sentences today.

Ronald Guy, 63, and his son Lee, 42, both from Birkenhead in Merseyside, were branded 'absolutely inhumane' after filming themselves feeding live pigeons to ferrets, cutting off the heads of chickens with knives and setting a pack of dogs on a fox.

But the the pair were today jailed for just 12 and 22 weeks respectively after admitting a total of seven animal cruelty offences at Wirral Magistrates' Court.

Attack: The two men were heard laughing as they encouraged their three dogs to attack wild rats

Lee Guy was jailed for 22 weeks after he used a mobile phone to film himself feeding wild pigeons to ferrets and setting up a fight between three dogs and a fox.

His father Ronald Guy, 63, was jailed for
 12 weeks after causing unnecessary suffering to animals through the 
‘inhumane’ slaughter of chickens.

At an earlier hearing in February,
 Lee Guy pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including the inhumane 
slaughter of chickens, causing wild rats to be attacked by dogs and 
taking feral pigeons to feed ferrets.

He also pleaded guilty to causing an animal fight by placing a fox with three dogs.

Ronald Guy had earlier pleaded guilty to one charge of the inappropriate slaughter of chickens. 

Trapped: Lee Guy is pictured holding a cage containing a wild rat he captured. Lee and his father Ronald would later set the rat loose in a courtyard and encourage their dogs to tear it to pieces

Hunt: The captured rats were released from their cages into a rundown courtyard, where Lee Guy and his father Ronald would then set their dogs on them

Sick: On a video released by the RSPCA, the three dogs can be seen chasing the terrified rat before pinning it in a corner and tearing it to pieces

Referring to Lee Guy’s role in the
 acts, Chris Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'The charges involve the 
slaughter of chickens, and the causing of wild rats to be attacked by 
dogs.

'There are three offences relating to the rats and there’s also an offence relating to the feeding of wild pigeons to ferrets.

'And
 an offence - perhaps the most serious - of causing the animal fight to 
take place between a fox and three dogs. The dogs were set upon the fox 
that was kept in a caged box, tearing it apart and killing it.'

Several
 of the offences - which took place between November 2011 and June 2013 -
 took place in front of gathered crowds and were captured on video.

Lee Guy could even be heard laughing on the footage.

Pain: The dogs eventually get hold of the rat as it tries to escape down a drain. They then tear it apart

No escape: Elsewhere in the footage, the dogs are seen being encouraged to enter a small cage in which a fox is held. The dogs can then be seen viciously attacking the animal

John Ballam, defending, said both defendants were ‘very ashamed’ by their actions.

He
 added Ronald Guy had enjoyed success at dog shows with pets in the past
 and that the prospect of being banned from owning animals would be a 
'considerable punishment' to him.

But District Judge Michael Ableson ignored pleas to give the defendants suspended sentences.

'This was absolutely inhumane behaviour to treat animals in this way,' he said.

'Most people would not be able to comprehend how you could treat animals with such cruelty.'

RSPCA officer Anthony Joynes described the case as the worst one of its kind he had ever dealt with and welcomed the sentences.

Vicious: The fox is quickly torn to pieces by the dogs, as one of the two men is heard encouraging them to increase their aggression

Death: The fox eventually escapes from the cage, but the dogs follow it to a grassy area, where it is torn apart

'These sort of offences are just barbaric. It is abhorrent cruelty that belongs in the history books,' he said.

'There has been a rise in this sort of behaviour across the North West and if people are going to take that decision to get involved in that sort of cruelty then they can expect to spend time in prison,' he added.

'Lee Guy is clearly obsessed with the interaction between predator and prey, even to the point that I could hear laughter in the background,' Mr Joynes went on to say.

The defendants were also ordered to pay £300 each in court costs. Their four dogs, one of which has since given birth to six puppies, have also been seized.
