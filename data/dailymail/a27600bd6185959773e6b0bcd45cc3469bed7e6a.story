A federal appeals court has denied bail for a New York City police officer charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women after a prosecutor described how the suspect was allegedly salivating over the prospect of cooking a female friend.

'My mouth was watering the whole time,' Gilberto Valle allegedly told a friend on an online forum after he had lunch in Baltimore with a former college pal.

The disgraced NYPD cop later fantasized about slow-cooking and eating the woman, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said in court Tuesday.

NYPD Officer Michael Van Hise (left) and 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle (right) were partners. Van Hise has been charged with conspiracy to kidnap and planning crimes against children of his own family

In online transcripts cited by NBC4 Valle at one 
point tells a co-conspirator that his oven is 'big enough to fit one of 
these girls if I folded their legs.'

'I was thinking of tying her body 
onto some kind of apparatus...cook her over a low heat, keep her alive 
as long as possible,' he is accused of saying in the July conversation.

Also on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge 
Paul Gardephe delayed the trial date. Now, jury selection will get under
way February 11, with opening statements beginning on February 25.

Originally, the trial was scheduled 
for next Tuesday, but Valle's lawyers said they need extra time to prepare 
because being in prison has made it difficult for Valle to review nearly
a million pages of evidence.

Defense attorney Julia Gatto said 
authorities had arranged for him to look at evidence on a computer 
during the day but he must be handcuffed while doing so.

He has been imprisoned since he was 
charged last fall with using a law enforcement database between last 
January and October 24 as he made plans to kidnap, rape, kill and eat 
women while communicating with others on a website devoted to the 
exploration of deviant sexual fantasies.

Defense lawyers have said all along he was engaging in sexual fantasies and intended no violence.

Last week, a 22-year-old Trenton, New
Jersey, man Michael Van Hise, was charged in the case. He was accused of
trying to hire Valle to kidnap a Manhattan woman that he could rape and
kill.

He, like Valle, has pleaded not 
guilty to conspiracy. Van Hise’s lawyer has said her client never 
intended to harm anyone and made that clear to investigators with whom 
he cooperated for several months before his arrest.

Gruesome: Defense lawyers failed to convince a federal appeals court that NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, right, should be free on bail after a prosecutor said how the suspect had allegedly described his mouth watering after meeting an old friend for lunch

During Tuesday’s appeals arguments, 
defense attorney Edward Zas said Valle was just like 40,000 other people
who go online to 'engage in the most heinous depraved chats but they 
are imaginary.'

Circuit Judge Chester J. Straub 
questioned how the defense could argue that the case was built solely on
fantasies when there was evidence that Valle and others used real 
names, engaged in surveillance and discussed how much money would be 
charged to kidnap a woman.

Zas said aspects of the government’s 
case were already crumbling, including its claim that he went to 
Maryland to conduct surveillance on a woman, who now says she knew the 
police officer and there was nothing unusual about his visit.

Zas called the prosecution misguided and predicted Valle would be exonerated.

'He’s done nothing except imagine bad
things and put them foolishly on the Internet in a very bad way,' Zas 
said. 'If there is just role playing...there is no crime at all. The 
only crime is in Mr. Valle’s imagination.'

The prosecutor the court that the 
government had inadvertently mischaracterized the purpose of Valle’s 
visit with the woman in Maryland but added that there was plenty of 
other evidence that went beyond fantasy.

She said, for instance, that Valle 
had accessed the recipe for chloroform and sent it to a co-conspirator 
and had an operating plan for kidnapping and cooking women.

Waxman said Valle had created plots 
that were a 'depraved, disgusting, troubling, gruesome' blueprint for 
kidnappings, and she noted that his wife had insisted on removing their 
daughter from their home.

'He risked his job, his marriage, his child and his freedom to engage in these acts,' she said.

Allegations: Prosecutors told a Manhattan court that Van Hise sent a photo of his wife's seven-year-old niece to two people in an internet chat room, offering her and her nine-year-old sister for rape (pictured with wife Bolise)

Parners: Valle and Van Hise served as partners at the New York Police Department's 29th precinct, in New York

Last week, Valle's partner, NYPD officer Michael Van Hise, has appeared in court for allegedly planning crimes against children in his own family.

Van
Hise is alleged to have plotted to turn his three-year-old stepdaughter
into a sex slave and offered his two nieces for rape on the internet.

Prosecutors told the court that Van 
Hise sent a photo of his wife’s seven-year-old niece to two people in an
internet chat room, offering her and her nine-year-old sister for rape.

They also alleged Van Hise had similar plans for his own stepdaughter, whose identity has not been revealed for legal reasons.

'He
suggests that "there are three we can rape, et cetera ...,"' said 
federal prosecutor Randall Jackson said at Van Hise’s bail hearing 
yesterday, reported the New York Daily News.

Referring
to the online message, posted on Yahoo.com, he added: 'The 
three-year-old (stepdaughter) he wants to keep as his sex slave.'

He allegedly also posted the street in Hamilton, New Jersey, on which the girls live, adding: 'We can engage in other activities [with them]', the court was told.

Mr Jackson said Van Hise told an FBI 
agent that he and Valle were 'serious' about their plans to kidnap and 
rape a woman before admitting he was sexually aroused around children.

Van
Hise's estranged wife, Bolise, 22, defended him as a 'big teddy bear', 
adding: 'They make him out to be a monster. He’s not. He’s as hard-core 
as a baby.'

The alleged 
plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan, 28, 
tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans 
to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims.

Internet messages: The alleged plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan (pictured together), 28, tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims

Files found on the father of one’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent.

Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’.

In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator.

His defence maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer, who served in Harlem for six years.

Valle plead not guilty to all charges, including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims.

He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment.
