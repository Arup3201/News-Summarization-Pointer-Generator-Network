She's Burberry's flawless campaign star and never has a hair out of place on the catwalk, but Suki Waterhouse has revealed she had a total style faux pas when she met President Obama.

The model was lucky enough to join her boyfriend Bradley Cooper at the White House State Dinner earlier this year but things didn't go quite to plan.

Speaking about getting ready for the big event in a rare interview, the 22-year-old told Grazia: 'My hair and make up was organised for me in Washington. So this guy comes over and says he hasn’t worked since the '80s. 

'I can’t even describe what happened next. There was blue eye shadow up to my brows, my fringe was backcombed…Seriously I walked out to show my boyfriend and we were on the floor dying. I had to wet my hair and grease it back so I looked like crap to meet the President!'.

Suki and Bradley have been enjoying a long-distance romance after the two first met in London a year ago. 

The British model talked about that fated night at the Elle Style Awards in London in an interview in Rollacoaster magazine recently.

Can you tell? Suki explains that when she had her make-up done there was blue eye shadow up to her brows and her fringe was backcombed. ' I had to wet my hair and grease it back so I looked like crap to meet the President!,' she said

Suki proudly shared the story of their first night together, where they ended up in a night club, digging up the dancefloor.

'We were dancing at the after-party, and he asked me if I fancied going to a club. We went to Cirque Le Soir in London - and he’s a ridiculously good dancer, yes. But I’m a serious dancer too, so I don’t know if I was fully concentrating on that. 

'We make a pretty good duo, though.”She also discussed why her relationship with Bradley, 39, is rarely brought up in interviews: 'Yes, I never get asked about it, because they all think I’m not going to answer them.‘

Though at first the couple were rarely seen out together, over the last few months, Suki has been accompanying Bradley to a number of award shows and events - they even double dated with Sienna Miller and Tom Sturridge. 

As well as dating a Hollywood heartthrob, Suki's career is sky-rocketing.

In the last month alone Suki Waterhouse has closed the Burberry show, landed herself a role in a Hollywood blockbuster and designed her own range of sneakers.

Clearly not content with her lot (in between dating Bradley and partying with Cara Delevingne), the 22-year-old model is now the star of Burberry's latest beauty campaign.

The quintessentially British fashion house, which made its first foray into beauty this year, have called on their fashion family member Suki to showcase their new mascaras, eyeliners and brow definer.

Developed by Burberry Make-up Artistic Consultant Wendy Rowe, who glammed-up the girls for the SS15 show, and under the creative direction of Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Bailey, the new products promise a 'youthful look of naturally sculpted, full brows with defined eyes and enhanced lashes'. 

Speaking about the new range, Wendy Rowe said: 'The new Burberry make-up products effortlessly create the illusion of a natural, larger eye.

'In order to enhance the lash and make it as natural and full as possible we have developed two new mascaras, each giving a slightly different finish.'

There's also a kohl eyeliner and eyebrow definer, which are no doubt loved by Burberry's other campaign stars, Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss. 

Suki's life as a model began after being scouted in a pub when she was 16. She quit school to pursue a career in the fashion industry and Suki is now one of Britain's most famous model faces.

By the age of 19, she was modelling lingerie for Marks and Spencer and has since worked with Swatch, H&M and Pepe Jeans. 

After several seasons of modelling for Italian trainers brand Superga, the 22-year-old has now designed her own range of super-cool sneakers. 

And clearly not content with just fashion, Suki will try her hand at acting as Marlene in the upcoming sequel The Divergent Series: Insurgent, based on the book of the same name.
