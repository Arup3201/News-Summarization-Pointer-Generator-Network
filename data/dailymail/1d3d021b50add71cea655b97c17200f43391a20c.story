Nicole McDonough, 32, is charged with second-degree official misconduct 

A New Jersey attorney says it was 'not a crime' for his client, a married high school teacher, to have sex with an 18-year-old student student.

English teacher Nicole McDonough, 32, was arrested Tuesday on a charge of second-degree official misconduct for an alleged sexual relationship with an 18-year-old male student at West Morris Mendham High School.

The married mother-of-two, who is on her seventh year as a teacher, was placed on paid leave and has been released on $75,000 bail.

Attorney Timothy Smith says the case against his client is 'legally and factually flawed' and that she will be proven innocent, NJ.com reported.

'I don't think she did [it], but if she did, it's not a crime,' he told the news website. 

The student attended West Morris Mendham High School, where McDonough, a married mother of two, works as an English teacher

Earlier this year, Smith represented 36-year-old teacher Adrian McConney, who was also charged with a similar crime but saw the case dropped.

The judge ruled the relationship was not unlawful and the official misconduct charge would not stand.

Smith hopes to get to a similar resolution with McDonough's case. 

'This prosecution is obviously based on someone's belief as to what the law should be, as opposed to what it is,' he told NJ.com.

'When justice is served, it will be Nicole's integrity, and not the integrity of those who over-zealously persecuted her, that will be preserved.'

Morris County prosecutors say McDonough and an unnamed student at her school had sex between May 31 and June 2.

The complaint did not elaborate on details or disclose if the 18-year-old was one of her students. 

McDonough's attorney says it was 'not a crime' for her to have sex with one of the school's students because he was already 18-years-old

McDonough, of Mount Olive, New Jersey, teaches honors and International Baccalaureate-level English courses.

She graduated from the College of St. Elizabeth with a bachelor's degree in English literature.

On her page at the school's website, which has since been removed, McDonough writes: 'Although teaching is one of my many passions, I am also a mom, a personal trainer, and a cross-fitter.

'I am a mother of two amazing girls. We also have a puggle named Tegan.'

'The classroom is one of my many loves and I am excited to return to start a full year of school!'
