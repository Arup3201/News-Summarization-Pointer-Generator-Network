Did I do that? Donald Preston Jr appeared unaware that he had crashed his SUV into Atlantic City's Irish Pub Sunday afternoon as police arrested him for drunk driving

Atlantic City's famed Irish Pub has closed for the first time since Hurricane Sandy when a man crashed his car into the bar after being refused a drink.

Donald Preston Jr, 50, of Pleasantville, New Jersey was charged with drunk driving after ramming into the historic 111-year-old bar Sunday afternoon.

Bartender Jack Dziegrenuk told the Press of Atlantic City that Preston appeared intoxicated when he came into the 24-hour bar around 2:30pm, so he refused to serve him.

After that, Preston took off his jacket and placed it on a stool to go to the bathroom. When he came out, he grabbed his jacket and the bartender thought 'This will be easy on me' as Preston smiled, waved and walked out the door.

But just a few minutes later the bar was shaken by a blast as Preston drove his SUV straight into the building near the front door.

'It sounded like a bomb pretty much went off,' manager Tracey Talley told NBC 40.

Talley said the drunk driver struck the bar right where a couple was sitting, but they had gotten up just seconds before.

Only one patron was injured in the crash, but refused medical attention on the scene.

The bar is now closed for the first time since 2012's Hurricane Sandy since Preston left a gaping hole in the front of the building. The bar's century-old cherrywood bar was pushed in slightly at the base and its metal guad rail dented. The crash also broke a water pipe.

Crash: Firefighters examine the damage to the Irish Pub on Sunday

The damage: No one was injured in the crash but the bar sustained major damage. Preston's car left a gaping hole in the front of the building and also pushed in the century-old cherrywood bar

Fellow manager Frank Pileggi told MailOnline that full restoration will take a month or more but they are working to cover the hole in the front temporarily to reopen for business on Thursday or Friday, in time for Super Bowl Sunday.

Surveillance footage viewed by the Press of Atlantic City shows Preston leaving the bar and driving his SUV around in circles before taking a turn and barreling into the bar. Mr Pileggi says they have turned the surveillance footage over the police, and are not allowed to release it.

The pub's managers don't believe Preston did it on purpose, since he asked police 'Did I do that?' while being arrested.

An accident: Pub manager Tracey Talley says she doesn't believes Preston drove into the bar out of vengeance, just that he lost control

'I don't think he was driving into the building. I just think he lost control of the car,' Ms Talley said.

Mr Pileggi says Preston didn't seem vengeful and there wasn't a confrontation with the bartender.

The six-story brick building housing the Irish Pub has been a boardwalk fixture since 1900 and has only been owned by three families in its entire history.

It was initially opened as the Elwood Hotel. During Prohibition, it was turned into a speakeasy dance hall complete with a secret staircase and a trap door under the carpeting.

After: Staff say the damage will take a month or more to fix, but it will be reopen by Thursday or Friday, in time for Super Bowl Sunday

Current owner Cathy Burke bought the pub with her husband Richard in 1971, and says she has experienced an unexpected outpouring of support from all over the world following the crash.

'Different people have called or dropped by,' Mrs Burke told the Press.'They give best wishes and they ask, "Are you going change things?" I say, you canâ€™t improve on perfection. I want everything to look exactly the same. To me, I want the Pub to be the Pub.'

In addition to the DWI charge, Preston faces charges of careless driving and failure to stop while entering the roadway.
