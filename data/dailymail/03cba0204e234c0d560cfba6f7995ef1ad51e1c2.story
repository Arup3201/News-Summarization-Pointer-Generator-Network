Tragic: Edward Mallen, pictured, died near his home in Meldreth, Cambridgeshire on Monday

A gifted 18-year-old pupil who had won a place at Cambridge University was killed by a train after suffering a lapse into 'deep depression', his parents said today.

Edward Mallen, an accomplished pianist, died near his home in Meldreth, Cambridgeshire, on Monday - just months before he had hoped to start a geography degree at Girton College.

His parents said  their 'remarkable' and 'caring' son had recently suffered an 'inexplicable, sudden, brutal and remorseless' decline into depression.

The teenager, a student at Hills Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge, had received 12 A*s at GCSE - the best results in 50 years at his school - and was predicted three A* at A level.

His mother Suzanne, 46, and father Steve, 49, said their son, the eldest of three teenage siblings, would be deeply missed and appealed for more support for young people with depression.    

They urged authorities to put more funding into stopping the 'relentless spread' of psychological disorders among teens.

In a statement released today, Mr and Mrs Mallen said: 'Edward was a truly remarkable individual whose academic brilliance was matched only by his caring, friendly and warm character.

'Despite intense efforts, Edward's inexplicable, sudden, brutal and remorseless recent decline into a deep depression could not be averted.

'We implore the authorities to reconsider the funding and resources directed towards alleviating the seemingly relentless spread of psychological disorders and anxieties amongst our young people.

'Tragedies like this can and must be avoided.'

The family added that they are 'utterly devastated by the sudden and traumatic loss of our lovely son and brother' and the world has been 'measurably diminished' without him. 

Linda Sinclair, headmistress of Hills Road Sixth Form College,  said she was 'shocked and deeply saddened' by the loss of an 'exceptional young man'.

She added: 'Ed combined outstanding academic ability with extraordinary personal qualities.

'So gifted yet so unassuming, he was a truly special person and was greatly admired by all who knew him.

'He will be missed enormously. Our heartfelt sympathies are with Ed's family at this sad and difficult time.' 

Edward died after being hit by a train near the College Farm crossing at about 3pm on Monday. British Transport Police are appealing for witnesses.
