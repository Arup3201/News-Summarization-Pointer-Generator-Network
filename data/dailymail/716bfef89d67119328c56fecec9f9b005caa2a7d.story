Ecologists in Russia are demanding police  prosecute a poacher who killed animals then posted gruesome pictures of his 'trophies' on his social network page.

Siberian Pavel Gotovchikov - a university physical education teacher - posted more than 50 pictures of animals he had killed, including one in which a dead beaver is stuck to a post with sticky tape. 

Among more than 50 graphic  photographs is one showing him with a dead beaver stuck to a post with sticky tape.

Ecologists in Russia are demanding police prosecute poacher Pavel Gotovchikov who has killed dozens of animals and then posted gruesome pictures of his 'trophies' on his social network page, like the one above

Gotovchikov is pictured with a whooper swan, which he holds by the throat while resting his gun on its back

Gotovchikov fixed a vodka glass in the beaver's paw while he also holds a glass, evidently toasting the animal's slaughter.

Another shows him kissing the corpses of a baby deer and its mother in the boot of his car. 

Other images provide further proof of Gotovchikov's illegal poaching. The show him with a freshly killed whooper swan, hares, squirrels, buzzards and an elk. The images date back to 2009.

Animals rights campaigners have called the images a desecration of the corpses, but despite their anger it is unclear what action - if any - Russian police will take. 

Alexei Gribkov, chairman of Geblerovskoe Ecological Society in the Altai region, said Gotovchikov's photos were proof that he was hunting illegally. 

He said: 'For example, he is depicted in some of the pictures with a killed whooper swan.

'Gotovchikov posted on the photo calling the swan a 'northern goose' but there is no such type of bird.

In this photo, dated May 2011, Gotovchikov displays a gallery of dead animals while wearing no trousers

The physical education teacher holds a dead hare by its ears; his fingers are bloodied with the kill 

'Apart from the fact that a whooper swan can't be hunted, the poaching is confirmed by the fact that the bird was killed in April at a time banned by local legislation.

'All in all, there are about 50 photos of corpses and parts of corpses posted in Gotovchikov's profile on the Odnoklassniki website. Over 25 photos confirm he was poaching.'

Gotovchikov, a resident of the Altai region in western Siberia, is head of the DOSAAF shooting club. He lists his job as a kettleball coach at the Altai State University.

Conservationists point to the dates many of the images were taken, or the weather conditions outside, as evidence he has been killing animals illegally and off-season.

For instance in the pictures with dead hares, the grass is green and there are still leaves on trees, yet hunting them is banned during the spring and summer months breeding period.

The poacher holds the bloodied head of an elk aloft; it is one of about 50 images he posted online

Poaching a baby deer no older than three months old is likely to break the Russian Federation Criminal Code.

Buzzards, grey heron, and whooper swan also can not be hunted, yet Gotovchikov happily poses for pictures with the dead animals, often with his gun in his hands. 

Mr Gribkov - whose organisation has appealed to the Altai region prosecutor's office and the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate - said: 'It is a desecration of the corpse, there is no other word for it.

'The culmination of the impiety is the photo depicting Gotovchikov kissing the corpses of a baby and mother roe in the boot of his car.'

Mr Gribkov said since raising concerns over the poaching, Gotovchikov's employers have said he no longer works for the university.

His current whereabouts are unknown.
