Has the sunny weather left you feeling frisky? If so, you aren't alone, according to a new poll which found that couples make love more often when the sun is shining.

The survey asked more than 2,000 people to reveal the month in which they had the most sex and sunny August came out on top.

It took the title with 18 per cent of the vote, while February brought up the rear with just two per cent - in spite of Valentines Day.

Sunshine: According to the poll, sunnier days equal more sex for most couples - particularly in August

After August, the most popular months for lovemaking were the equally balmy July and June, with 14 and  10 per cent of the vote each.

Beautiful May came next with six per cent, surprisingly followed by the chilly month of December on five per cent, which would suggest that there's more than one way to get into the Christmas spirit.

By contrast, the remaining autumn and winter months were considered the least sexy by respondents, with February proving least popular, followed by November, January, March and October.

Spring months did better, with April appearing in seventh position, just behind September in sixth.

Researchers put the results down to the higher melatonin levels seen in most of us during the winter months, which can lead to a lower sex drive, depression and lethargy. 

Similarly, tests have shown that men have 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January.

Since men with more testosterone have more orgasms, more sun spells more and better sex.

The findings were also backed up by a study conducted by scientists at the University of South Brittany in France which found that people are more likely to flirt when the sun is out.

According to researchers, girls were more likely to give their phone number out when approached by an attractive male when the weather was good rather than overcast.

A spokesman for sex toy website Lovehoney which conducted the survey, said: 'We have just had the bleakest winter in history, but now the sun is out and we are all feeling frisky.

'The sun shining changes everyone's moods and, of course, means we are wearing far few clothes.

'It's much easier to flirt and have fun when the weather is warm - and that means are lot more of us are getting it on.'
