Palace: The treehouse in Oxfordshire took a group of 25 people three years to build

An award-winning treehouse which teenagers spent three years building 85ft up a lime tree will be torn down over health and safety fears.

The group of boys built the lofty eight-storey-high home with a front door, windows, a spiral staircase and a viewing platform in a farmer's field near the village of Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire.

But the farmer said it must be torn down because he could be sued if someone fell off - and it is so entwined in branches, the whole tree will have to be felled.

The five main builders of the treehouse, which was worked on by 25 youngsters, said they were 'gutted' at the demolition but understood why it had to happen.

Dougie Haynes, Joe East, Buzz Burrell, Harry Court, Alden Conley and Ollie Cavey estimate 1,000 hours of work went into the hideout, which began modestly three years ago.

Work escalated last summer as they scavenged for materials from skips and built upon the 45ft home they had already constructed with no more tools than nails and a hammer.

Mr Haynes, 19, who hopes to study architecture at university, said: 'At the end of the day I will accept it but I will be pretty gutted about it as I put so much time into it. This summer could have been pretty awesome.'

'In about October we started building the top half and it coincided with the leaves falling off - that's when villagers started to notice it.

'I would say you have to be pretty reckless to ever fall or hurt yourself. We are always very careful with new people.

Mr Haynes, who works at a shopping centre and with a carpenter, added: 'The worst injury I ever had there was I stood on a nail, that was when I was building it. I would not say it's dangerous at all.'

The astonishing palace in the sky was entered into a competition on Facebook to find the nation's best treehouse, and scooped the top prize.

The judges of the Blue Forest's Treehouse Competition praised it for being 'ludicrously high up' and reminded them of 'those halcyon days we all spent playing in a treehouse when we were younger'.

Home comforts: They have even managed to haul a wicker sofa up into the tree - but the owner of the farm on which they built, Tim Taylor, fears he will be sued if someone falls to their death from the treetop home

They also said it felt homely and had 'a strong feeling of the personality of everyone that created and continues to enjoy this treehouse.'

Farmer Tim Taylor said: 'I didn't know until it had been built.

'They would have been alright if they had stayed [at 40ft] but it's 80ft up. They went up above the canopy.

'Once I knew that, and people got on to me, I mentioned it to my insurance people and I dare not let it stay there. It's just too ridiculous. You can see it from everywhere.

'It's very unfortunate. If I could see a way to leave it there I would have done.

'But if someone falls and breaks something it will be my problem.'

The leafy home may be impressive, but it is far from the only ultra-ambitious treehouse in the world.

The dense forests of North America have several treetop homes which would not look out of place in fantasy novels. Many were built as pet projects by carpenters or run as boutique hotels.

At Treehotel in rural northern Sweden, guests pay hundreds of pounds a night to stay in treehouses shaped like birds nests or made out of mirrors.

Those who want to take their lives in their hands by enjoying the Oxfordshire treehouse do not have long, however - as it is thought it will be felled in just a few weeks.
