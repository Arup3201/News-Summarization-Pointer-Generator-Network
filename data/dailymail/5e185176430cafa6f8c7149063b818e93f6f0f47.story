Jeremy Paxman has dismissed rumours he is quitting Newsnight in the wake of the botched exposé that falsely linked a Tory peer to a paedophile ring.

The presenter denied claims that he has become 'deeply disillusioned' with the crisis engulfing the Corporation and insisted he would 'definitely' be returning to the flagship show this week.

However, he has refused to confirm whether he would remain there for the long term.

I'll be back: Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman (pictured) insists he will be returning to the show on Wednesday amid rumours he is quitting over a bungled child abuse expose

Mr Paxman, who has worked on the programme for 23 years, told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have been away filming, but I will definitely be there on Wednesday'.

The 62-year-old provoked fears he would leave Newsnight earlier this month after he blamed 'cowards and incompetents' for the departure of director general George Entwistle following the bungled child abuse documentary.

The BBC2 programme aired false allegations which led to former Conservative treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as a paedophile.

Speaking earlier this month, Mr Paxman said: 'George Entwistle's departure is a great shame. The real problem here is the BBC's decision, in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry, to play safe by appointing biddable people.

'They then compounded the problem by enforcing a series of cuts on programme budgets, while bloating the management. That is how you arrive at the current mess on Newsnight.'

The BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten and acting director general Tim Davie are deciding whether the programme can survive the corporation's crisis.

Lord McAlpine last week agreed a £185,000 compensation settlement with the BBC and his lawyers are also pursuing further possible claims from Twitter users who wrongly named him as having abused children at a children's home.

The Newsnight investigation at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales in the 1970s was a joint project with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which is also being sued by Lord McAlpine.

BBC insiders have been left staggered that the show's acting editor Liz Gibbons and duty lawyers did not insist that the claims by former care home resident Stephen Messham in the programme were put to the peer.

Mr Entwistle resigned over the fiasco and Mr Overton quit his job over his disastrous Twitter message advertising the Newsnight programme ahead of its broadcast.

Newsnight carried a full, on-air apology a week after it aired and Lord McAlpine's World At One interview was carried across BBC news broadcasts.

In the interview, he said he was 'conscious' that his £185,000 settlement would be paid by licence-payers and not directly by those who made or authorised the programme.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an apology to Lord McAlpine on its website 'for the extent to which its contribution to the Newsnight broadcast on 2 November fell short of the high standards it expects and for any incorrect speculation about the identity of the politician that may have been encouraged by the Bureau’s Managing Editor’s tweet in advance of the broadcast'.

Newsnight's editor Peter Rippon had earlier been forced to stand aside after refusing to air an investigation into claims Jimmy Savile had abused children.
