As the daughter of a billionaire business magnate Camilla Al Fayed needn't work. But she says that  to stay at home or spend her time shopping 'would be a waste of a life'.

The ambitious heiress, 28, decided to sink her teeth into a new business venture after tiring of being a stay-at-home mother to daughter Luna, now three, and stepped in to save her friend's ailing fashion business just in the nick of time.

The Issa fashion brand had been a favourite of the Middleton sisters for years but when Kate wore one of their wrap dresses to announce her engagement the world went crazy for the Brazilian label and the small company couldn't cope.

Camilla, friends with Issa founder and designer Daniella Helayal, decided to buy a majority stake in the company and is now spearheading their global expansion.

'If Kate wears a Zara dress, these huge companies have the backing to follow through.

'Issa was basically run by interns, students and Daniella. There was no business model,' Al Fayed told the Times.

It was when the company was on the brink of collapse in 2011 that Al Fayed stepped in to buy out a 51 per cent stake, effectively saving the brand which showed a stunning Navajo collection at London Fashion Week last month.

The heiress might have no formal retail or 
business training, but she has been schooled in style since childhood and understands what 
sells and what women want from fashion.

She said: 'I'm very much taught in the University of Harrods, and what better place?

'Harrods was my second home for four or five days a week when I left school.

After hanging around at Harrods as a teenager Camilla headed to New York aged 18 where she assisted Anna Wintour at US Vogue in what was 'literally the Devil Wears Prada job'.

'It was an amazing experience, to live and work in New York, and [Anna Wintour] is an amazing woman.

'What better start to my fashion journey?' she said.

Now, as chairman of Issa (whose fans 
also include Madonna and Eva Mendes) Camilla is continuing her fashion journey by taking the brand global.

She said: 'Japan is the gateway to Asia
and we intend to expand into Hong Kong and China within the next few 
years. We will then become a truly global brand.'

Having previously sold their wares only online or through department store concessions, Issa London will be opening a permanent outlet in Tokyo's Roppongi Hills shopping centre next month.

The label hosted a pop-up store in Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza, a Tokyo district, last year so has already formed strong connections with the country.

The fashion house is famed for its silky, wraparound styles.

In
a statement Camilla added: 'The response was overwhelming and we knew 
our formula was the right one for Japan. What makes Issa popular in 
Japan is a love of our quirky prints, our colour palette and elegant 
silhouettes.

'We work 
closely with our partners to design collections that are on brand for 
Issa, but culturally aligned to the Japanese consumer. Our other main 
focus is the Middle East. We expect to open a store in Kuwait by the end
of the year, with several more planned over the following four years.'

Issa
have plans to open a flagship store in Sao Paolo, Brazil, at the end of
the year, in the Cidade Jardim mall, which already houses luxury labels
Prada and Louis Vuitton. The store will honour the label's Brazilian 
heritage - Issa's Creative Director, Daniella Helayel, was raised in 
Rio.
