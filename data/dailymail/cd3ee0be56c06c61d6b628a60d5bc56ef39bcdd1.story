Betrothed: All the brides and grooms were college graduates who voluntarily served as village officials in remote townships

The reason for the mass wedding is unclear, but all the brides and grooms were college graduates who voluntarily served as village officials in remote townships.

Although
at first glance the couples all looked similar, the brides all picked 
their own individual wedding dresses, although they all had matching red and pink floral bouquets.

The sun was shining on their special day and while smart some of the grooms decided 
not to wear a tie as they peddled along in the heat.

But
riding a bike with a bride wearing a large white flowing dress can be a
tricky experience and one hapless groom took a wobble, before managing 
to upright himself at the last minute.
