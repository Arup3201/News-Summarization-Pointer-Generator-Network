'Thank you very much to all my companions at this time, especially my family, parents, brothers, godmother and friends,' said Gutierrez

Gutierrez, 31, discovered he had cancer following a collision with then Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in May 2013.

The South American said he felt 'a lot of pain that wouldn't go away' which resulted in the versatile midfielder undergoing a scan in his native Argentina.

Gutierrez raised money for an Argentine cancer charity in October by running the Buenos Aires Marathon.

He ran the 26.2 mile course for Fuca (Foundation for Research, Teaching and Cancer Prevention).
