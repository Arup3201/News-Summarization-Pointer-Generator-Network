A judge on Monday revoked probation for Chris Brown stemming from his 2009 assault of then-girfriend Rihanna, but the singer remained free on his own recognizance.

The 24-year-old singer was involved in an alleged hit-and-run incident in May that prompted the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to seek revocation of the five-year probation he was placed on after pleading guilty to assaulting Rihanna.

Brown was released on his own recognizance and was ordered to return to court in August to respond to the district attorney's allegations.

The Los Angeles County District 
Attorney's Office had earlier filed court documents asking a judge to 
revoke Brown's probation, according to a report in TMZ.

The request was made because Brown allegedly left the scene after rear-ending a woman's Mercedes-Benz in May.

The
Mercedes driver, Olga Gure-Kovalenko, claimed that Brown refused to 
hand over his driver's license, registration and insurance information 
after the accident.

Brown was with his other on-and-off girlfriend Karreuche Tran at the time.

Legal documents filed by prosecutors claimed that Brown 'willfully and unlawfully' broke the law in the hit-and-run incident.

Even if the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office does not pursue the case because the victim doesn't want to prosecute Brown, the county district attorney will seek revocation because Brown was supposed to obey all laws as a term of his probation.

Prosecutors in their court filing asked the judge to revoke Brown's probation and immediately remand him into custody.

The request was a standard one and it was not expected that Brown would be jailed.

If the judge revokes Brown's probation following the August hearing, he faces four years in prison.

Brown's representatives released a statement on Monday saying the lawyer for the alleged hit-and-run victim said his client did not want to press charges.

The lawyer specified that any damage was 'negligible' and Brown identified himself and gave appropriate insurance information.

'We are hopeful the case will be dismissed next week,' the statement said.

The judge supervising Brown's probation was required to revoke it due to the hit-and-run charge, but once the case is dismissed it was expected that probation would be reinstated on the same terms and conditions, the statement said.
