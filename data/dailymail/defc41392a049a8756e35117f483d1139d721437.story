New figures will reignite debates within the Tory party about their treatment of the squeezed middle

The number of Britons paying the 40p tax rate has risen by almost 400 per cent in 30 years.

This year 4.4million will pay higher-rate income tax compared with just 930,000 in 1984.

More than a million people have been dragged into the tax band since the Coalition took power.

An official report blamed the Government’s policy of lowering the threshold at which workers start paying the 40p rate, to pay for an increase in the personal allowance to help those on low incomes.

George Osborne did increase the threshold in this year’s Budget – but by just 1 per cent, below the rate of inflation.

The latest changes mean the income at which we pay the 40p tax rate has fallen from £43,875 at the time of the last election to £41,865 today.

The report from the House of Commons library said the threshold would be almost £50,000 if it had kept pace with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation since 2010.

The figures will reignite the debate within the Conservative Party over the decision to focus tax cuts on the low-paid while ignoring the squeezed middle classes.

Tory MPs are pushing for a clear commitment to address the 40p tax rate in the party’s next manifesto.

Former minister John Redwood said: ‘The 40p rate kicks in at too low a level – that is becoming increasingly clear.

‘The original idea was to catch people on earnings that were way above the average.  

‘Now it’s catching people who are struggling to pay  a mortgage. ‘I think the  Conservative Party will want to be seen as a party that  does not penalise people  who work hard and want to  be successful, and that does mean taking action on  his issue.’

Thirty years ago, when higher-rate tax was levied at between 40 and 60 per cent depending on income, it was paid by 930,000 – fewer than 4 per cent of taxpayers.

George Osborne did raise the threshold - by one per cent, which is less than the rate of inflation

Nigel Lawson cut the top rate to a flat 40 per cent in 1988. In its first full year, the rate was paid by 1.56million, or 6 per cent of taxpayers.

Yet by the turn of the century, the number paying the top rate had risen to 2.5million, or 9 per cent of workers. The figure now stands at a 4.4million, with a further 313,000 paying the top rate of 45p.

The Commons report said: ‘The number of taxpayers paying the additional or higher rates of tax remain a minority – around 16 per cent. However, this group pays a very large share of the total amount paid.’

It cited HMRC figures showing the top 10 per cent of taxpayers – or 5 per cent of adults – now account for 59 per cent of total income  tax contributions.
