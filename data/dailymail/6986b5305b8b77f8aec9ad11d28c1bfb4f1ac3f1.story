Grand hall: Amarhit and Gurdip, pictured outside Friar's Lawn in Southall, West London with their daughter Aunett and husky Rex, are downsizing

Among the 1930s semis of Southall in West London, the Georgian mansion Friars Lawn couldn’t be more incongruous.

With its gated entrance, wisteria-clad frontage and elegant proportions, the four-storey house is wholly at odds with the suburban streets that surround it.

It has a history which marks it out from the crowd, too. In the 1930s the six-bedroom house was owned by Gordon Selfridge Junior, whose father founded the Oxford Street department store. It was later bought by the actress Hayley Mills, daughter of actor Sir John Mills.

Hayley – who starred in hit films 
Pollyanna and The Parent Trap in the Sixties, and more recently appeared
 in ITV’s Wild At Heart – lived in the property with the actor Leigh 
Lawson for seven years in the 1970s.

Now
 the stunning house, which overlooks the trees and grass of Norwood 
Green, is being sold by dentist Amarjit Khambay after a painstaking 
four-year renovation which has set him back £750,000.

When
 Amarjit bought the Grade-II-listed house for three-quarters of a 
million pounds in 2002, he had no idea about the extent of the work 
required.

What started off as a supposedly straightforward job of damp proofing the basement snowballed into something much larger.

‘The builders discovered that all the timbers were infected with woodworm and the entire internal structure of the house had to be replaced,’ says Amarjit, 58.

‘The roof had to be stripped back and completely retiled.’

Then began the painstaking restoration
 of all the original features inside.

All the old windows were taken 
out, treated and refitted.

The original shutters were restored, 
cornicing was repaired and ceilings and walls were replastered using the
 same process and horsehair plaster as in the late 18th Century when the
 house was built.

The 
Khambays even employed a ‘heritage gardener’ who dug out the old 
Ordnance Survey maps to design and replant the walled garden exactly as 
it once was.

Extreme home makeover: The Khambays built an extension with a master suite and turned part of the basement into a gym, sauna, bar and spa pool

The house had 
been on the market for three years when Amarjit and his 53-year-old wife
 Gurdip, also a dentist, bought it from a retired Army officer and his 
wife.

Now for sale again, 
the £1.9 million price tag attached to Friars Lawn also sets it apart 
from its neighbours.

The three- and four-bed 1930s semis that surround 
it start at around £350,000.

‘If
 this house was on one of the smarter roads in Chiswick it would be on 
at £6 million at least,’ says estate agent Mark Poole, from Felicity J. 
Lord.

According to Mark, prices in the area around the house have risen 
by ten per cent in the last year.

‘There is strong demand for property 
at the moment – the biggest problem is not enough stock.’

Amarjit
 and Gurdip built a two-storey extension on the side of the house to 
create a kitchen/diner and master bedroom suite above. They turned part 
of the basement into a gym, sauna, bar and spa pool.

Because
 of the building’s listed status they had to work closely with English 
Heritage and Ealing Council’s conservation department. Planners 
stipulated that they use the same type of brick for the extension as the
 main house, in order to make it a seamless addition.

Luckily their architect was able to track some down from a salvage yard.

‘I’d
 never do it again,’ admits Amarjit, who moved to Britain from Punjab at
 the age of 12. The couple lived in the house throughout the upheaval of
 the building work, with their three then-teenage children playing 
musical bedrooms as each room was rebuilt.

However, Friars Lawn isn’t the first 
property project for the dentist, who has lived and practised in 
Southall for decades and has been property developing alongside his day 
job for a number of years.

He bought several old Fullers pubs in and 
around Chiswick, which he redeveloped into housing and sold on to the 
Notting Hill Housing Association.

Thankfully,
 profit margins weren’t a huge issue when it came to Friars Lawn as, 
when he bought, Amarjit had just made an eye-watering profit on the sale
 of a sports club nearby.

He had bought the complex, complete with 22 acres, for £330,000 and 
applied for planning permission to redevelop it, selling it on to a 
consortium for more than £2 million without having done anything to it.

The couple are selling Friars Lawn to downsize now that their three children, all in their twenties, have flown the nest.

‘I think of myself as an occupier, not an owner,’ says Amarjit, who takes great pride in his restoration of the house. ‘It’s really important to me that the right person buys Friars Lawn. It’s got to be someone who will continue to look after it as we have.

‘To me, it’s a very English house, which is why it appealed,’ he adds. ‘The couple we bought it from had bought it from Hayley Mills, who was moving to Hampton Court.

‘I am a big fan of hers. I like to think she would have enjoyed watching some of her films with her father in the cinema room in the basement.’
