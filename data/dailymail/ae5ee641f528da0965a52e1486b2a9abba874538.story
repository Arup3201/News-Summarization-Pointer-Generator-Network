It was only a matter of time before Buckingham Palace saw its first royal selfie.

And yesterday Princes William and Harry did just that, as they launched an online search for inspirational young people from around the Commonwealth on behalf of the Queen.

The brothers jokingly posed with internet entrepreneur Jamal Edwards, 23, on a ‘Twitter Mirror’ which has been set up in the illustrious 1855 Room, converted to a digital hub for the day.

Other guests at the royal event included celebrities like Jennifer Saunders and Joss Stone.

Poking their fingers towards the lens in a Lord Kitchener–style ‘Your Country Needs You!’ pose, the princes also made their own little bit of history.

A ‘Twitter Mirror’ – basically an iPad in a frame - is a device used to tweet pictures from large-scale events onto social media.

The princes also took part in a Google+ ‘Hangout’ with Mr Edwards and the Radio 1 DJ Gemma Cairney, talking live to young people in Jamaica, India, South Africa and Australia.

The Queen’s Young Leaders of the Commonwealth will see 240 young people who have changed their own lives as well as those of others receive awards at the palace between 2015 and 2018.

Harry said: ‘I have been fortunate to meet many amazing and inspirational young people in recent years.  

Next generation of leaders: The princes are joined by former Prime Minister John Major during the launch at Buckingham Palace. Harry spoke of how fortunate he was to have met so many inspirational young leaders

'Each is unique in many ways, and yet they all hold the same belief, that they can, and will, improve the lives of those around them.  Where others see challenges, they see opportunity!’

William added: ‘Believe in yourself - you have a lot more to say than you think.’

Fahma Mohamed, 17, who campaigns against female genital mutilation, and brothers Rob and Paul Forkan, who lost their parents in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami also attended the event.

Since then they have built up Gandys Flip Flops, a business that helps orphans around the world.

Rob, 26, said the Duke had sympathised 
with their life experiences: 'He said he lost his mum at 15 but there 
was always a silver lining and you should dust yourself off and carry 
on.

Hanging out: The princes took part in a Google+ hangout with Radio 1 DJ Gemma Cairney, during which they talked live to young people in Jamaica, India, South Africa and Australia

Original royal selfie: Prince Andrew made headlines when he took this photo in front of a giggling crowd at an event at St James's Palace earlier this year

'He applauded what we had done and said keep up the good work. He's got his own family now - that was his silver lining.'

Award winners will receive a tailored 
package of training, mentoring and networking, and be provided with a 
one-week residential programme in the UK during which they will receive 
their award.

The project aims to further strengthen 
the skills and confidence of the young leaders so they can return home 
and change the lives of those around them and inspire the next 
generation.

Prince Andrew became the first royal to actually take a ‘selfie’ earlier this year at an event in St James’s Palace.
