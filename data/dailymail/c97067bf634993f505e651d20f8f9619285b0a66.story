Two British servicemen have been withdrawn from the frontline while military chiefs investigate apparently damning photographs showing airmen posing beside the bloodstained body of a Taliban fighter.

In one graphic picture a grinning serviceman crouches beside the body lying in the sand and dirt while giving the thumbs up - trails of blood apparently from the man's wounds beside him.

Other disturbing photographs show the bodies of other Taliban fighters and there were concerns last night that the images could be used for recruitment and propaganda by the Taliban in the months leading up to the withdrawal of UK forces from Afghanistan later this year.

Shocking: The images, uploaded to the LiveLeak website, purportedly show a member of the RAF posing over a dead Taliban fighter

'Serious breach': It is against RAF rules to treat the bodies of enemies with disrespect. It is not clear whether the soldier pictured is the same as in the previous frame

Last night an Afghan veteran described 
them as 'grotesque' and said the apparent 'stupidity' of the servicemen 
had handed the Taliban 'a tool to beat us with.'

'This may have been taken as a "souvenir" but it is contrary to all instructions, it will go round the world on the internet and twisted so it comes back to haunt the reputation of the military after all the good we have done in Afghanistan.'

The photographs were taken in the aftermath of a daring Taliban attack on the main British base at Camp Bastion in September 2012 while Prince Harry was deployed in Afghanistan to fly Apache attack helicopters.

A group of 15 Taliban fighters wearing stolen US military uniforms crept towards Camp Bastion which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence. They cut through the wire and destroyed planes, vehicles and equipment.

A three-hour gun battle raged involving 50 British troops, some of whom won medals for bravery.

Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops - eight US and eight British - injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets and three vehicles.

As well as the coalition casualties, 14 Taliban were killed. The surviving gunman was captured.

It is two of these Taliban bodies and the subsequent actions of two members of the RAF Regiment - the ground fighting force of the Royal Air Force - tasked with guarding bases that is now at the centre of the hugely sensitive inquiry.

The images, which also show an US Marine Corps Harrier burnt and destroyed in a gutted hanger, first appeared on website LiveLeak. The Ministry of Defence said they came to its attention last month and military police were investigating.

Two of the photographs appear to show British airmen giving the thumbs up but it is unclear whether it is the same man.

Corpses: The graphic footage shows the Taliban fighters dead on the ground. It is thought they were involved in a 2012 attack on Camp Bastion

Probe: Military police are investigating the incident. Two RAF members have been withdrawn from frontline duties

Defence officials said last night there is no excuse for such behaviour, which appears to break military rules.

An RAF spokesman said it had a 'zero-tolerance policy on the mistreatment of deceased enemy personnel' and this case was being treated 'extremely seriously'.

'We can confirm that the incident is currently subject to an ongoing RAF Police investigation and therefore, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time,' he added.

The photographs emerged just months after Sergeant Alexander Blackman was convicted of executing a seriously-wounded Taliban prisoner when video footage taken on a colleague's head camera.

The 39-year-old - known as Marine A at his trial - blasted the captive in the chest at close range with his 9mm pistol in a 'moment of madness' on the battlefield.

Controversially, he is serving a minimum of 10 years in prison after becoming the first UK serviceman to be found guilty of murder in a warzone since at least the Second World War.

Blackman, from Taunton, Somerset, killed the injured insurgent following a fierce firefight on September 15, 2011. The captive had been hurt by cannon fire from an Apache helicopter after an attack on a British base in Helmand.

Recordings from a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade captured the moments when Blackman shot the prisoner and told him: 'Shuffle off this mortal coil, you ****.'

Last month a damning report by MPs said blunders by British commanders were 'devastatingly exploited' by the Taliban to allow them to carry out the raid at Bastion.

Attack: The footage, uploaded to the LiveLeak video site, also shows a destroyed United States Marine Corps Harrier fighter jet in its hangar

Wreckage: The footage seems to relate to the September 2012 attack

It found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years.

The latest scandal comes amid concerns that the pull out of British troops could spark a series of legal claims for compensation by the families of Afghans who claim to have been mistreated by UK forces.

Human rights lawyers are representing more than 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.

The vast majority of claims are being brought by two UK law firms - Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day - who are paid huge sums of taxpayers' money.

Public Interest Lawyers, founded by Birmingham-based lawyer Phil Shiner, fought a legal challenge which led to the then Labour government setting up the Al Sweady Inquiry in 2009.

The inquiry is examining allegations that British troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others at Camp Abu Naji near Basra in May 2004. It followed a ferocious firefight with insurgents dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, named after a checkpoint.

But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers Â£23million, the case sensationally fell apart last month APR when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in a central claim - that insurgents were murdered.

It was claimed that Iraqis had conspired to claim that British troops executed and tortured prisoners to secure huge compensation pay outs.
