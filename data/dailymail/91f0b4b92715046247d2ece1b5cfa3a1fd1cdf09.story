She may have been working in the industry for nearly 30 years, but Naomi Campbell is still one of the world's most in-demand models.

Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house -  Naomi, 44, admits that the industry, which is so often perceived as glamorous, can be really lonely. 

Speaking to Look magazine, the supermodel said: 'No one tells you how lonely it can be. You're travelling alone constantly and it can play on your psyche. 

'It's important to stay as strong as you can and to have good friends or family to lean on.' 

Stellar success: Naomi Campbell has worked for every major fashion house and is using her power and influence to raise funds for Ebola with the launch of a pop-up fashion shop

Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way. 

'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she recently told Net-a-Porter's The Edit.

As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor.

Charitable: In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the Fashion For Relief Campaign, in partnership with Westfield London - a pop-up shop selling designer clothes for the cause

'I don’t have to justify myself to anyone. I took off almost five years from work,' she said. 'But I’m a Gemini and I like to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends. If I go against my instincts, there is always a consequence.'

And one special man has helped her along the way - and now she wants to help others. '[Nelson] Mandela always said to me: "Use yourself to help other people." 

'I feel that now more strongly than ever before and I try to do that in the best way I can,' she said. 

She is certainly doing just that - she's raised millions for causes including Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. 

In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the Fashion For Relief Campaign, in partnership with Westfield London.

Famous friends: Naomi and Kate, pictured in 1999, have been friends for years and Kate is donating one of her outfits to the charitable cause 

The star is launching a one-week pop-up store opening to the public in The Village on November 28 as part of Westfield’s big Shopping weekend.

Naomi has called upon the world’s influential designers, brands and celebrities to join her and donate items for purchase. 

Designer products and accessories have been donated by Alexander McQueen, D&G and Givenchy and Jenny Packham, who has donated a gold sequinned worn by Dame Shirley Bassey. 

Her best friends Kate Moss and Stella McCartney have also donated clothes to the cause. 

Up for grabs: She will be donating this Victoria Beckham gold shift dress, worth over a thousand pounds, for £200 and these Alexander McQueen boots for £180
