With only one week till Schoolies nearly half of the teenagers that have booked are desperately trying to change their plans because of friendship drama.

With almost 30,000 school leavers expected to flood the streets of Surfers Paradise this year, teens were forced to book their accommodation well in advanced, nearly 12 to 18 months ago.

Now, nearly 50 per cent of bookings have been modified in an attempt to avoid awkward situations between friends who have fallen out.

With almost 30,000 school leavers expected to flood the streets of Surfers Paradise this year, teens were forced to book their accommodation well in advanced, nearly 12 to 18 months ago

Organisers said the majority of those trying to change their bookings are female 'drama queens' who are trying to reorganise their rooms.

'It seems to be prevalent among girls,' Matt Lloyd from Schoolies.com told Gold Coast Bulletin.

'Quite often they’ll book 12 to 18 months in advance and sometimes the whole room will change around.

'One girl moves in and then another one moves out. Funnily sometimes it goes back to what it originally was ... it’s almost like a circle.'

Up to a month before Schoolies teens are able to make changes to their accommodation online, after that all amendments must be made over the phone. 

'It gets pretty busy,' Mr Lloyd said. 

Party goers are able to change their bookings one day before the end of year celebration on November 22. 

But beware, your friendship break down might end up costing you $60 in room changing fees.
