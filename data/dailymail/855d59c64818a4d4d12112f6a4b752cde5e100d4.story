President Lyndon Baines Johnson was sworn in as the 36th president of the United States- just hours after President John F. Kennedy had been publicly assassinated- on board Air Force One, surrounded by press and photographers.

But no one thought it important to actually record where the plane stood at the exact moment of the transition of power.

Now, 48 years later, historians have finally taken the time to determine the precise location of the plane on the tarmac of the Dallas, Texas airport.

Swearing in: President Lyndon Baines Johnson took his oath of office on Air Force One in the Dallas airport

Accuracy: Air Force One is the centre plane in this photo taken at Love Field Airport on November 22, 1963, just hours after JFK was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. (See box below for more details)

The scene: This archival shot shows the location of Air Force One (centre) when President Johnson was sworn in. The hearse that carried President Kennedy's body is even seen below the plane's tail

The photo above is one of six slides donated to the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas by airport employee Noel Cook.

This is the widest shot of the batch, and shows three planes sitting on the tarmac on that historic afternoon.

The centre plane is Air Force One, which the Kennedys flew into Dallas that morning.

The plane to the left is Air Force Two, used by Mr Johnson when he arrived in Texas just before the Kennedys that morning.

The third plane, on the right, is the Pan Am plane used by the press. 

When looking at the close-up of Air Force One, viewers can see a white box-like object below the tail of the plane: that is the back of the hearse that brought President Kennedy's body to the airport from Parkland Hospital.

The search began last year when a Congressman that represents neighboring districts suggested that some type of historically commemorative marking be placed at the location of the plane to insure that the event is remembered.

The site is historic after all, as President Johnson was one of only five presidents to take his oath of office outside of Washington. (The others were George Washington, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt and Calvin Coolidge.)

Dallas Love Field Airport is due for major renovations, so it would be easy enough to construct a marker to distinguish the historic spot.

The prospect, surprisingly, left airport officials stumped.

No one thought to dig through the archives to ascertain the spot until Representative Dan Branch suggested it last year.

Nearly a year of on-and-off research 
later, the spot has been determined using photographs taken by
a Federal Aviation Authority employee who was working on that fateful 
day.

The worker, Noel Cook, 
climbed up on to the roof of the terminal and took photos of the plane 
once everyone had gotten on board for the swearing-in ceremony.

Mr Cook donated his film to The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, located in the portion of the former Texas School Book Repository where Oswald fired his three shots at the president, in the 1999 though he did not expect them to be of any relevance.

'He kept apologizing over and over, 
saying, “I know they’re not very good,”' the museum’s curator Gary Mack 
told The Dallas Morning News.

'And
I kept assuring him that all pictures were important; you don’t know 
what researchers in the future will be interested in,’ Mr Mack 
continued.

Mr Mack turned 
over scans of Mr Cook’s slides to the architects who are in charge of the Love 
Field Airport construction, and Jonathan Massey, the principal architect
for Corgan Associates, took over.

No indication: Air Force One arriving at Love Field Airport with President Kennedy on board hours before he was shot

Breaking news: Kennedy's death caused headlines and much confusion initially, and AP wire reports were the first to confirm the death. The incident caused the longest period of uninterrupted news on television until 9/11

Times have changed: A recent photo of Dallas Love Field runway 13L shows how the area looks different from 1963

‘I crawled all over the roof with my camera and tripod, holding up the photo to get things to match up with the way things are now,’ Mr Massey told The Dallas Morning News.

Massive construction on the airport since 1963 caused quite a few impediments to his angled view, but finally he figured out where the plane stood.

Then the next layer of details arose when he had to figure out where exactly President Johnson was standing on the plane.

That led to conversations with the archivists in charge of the Boeing 
707 used during President Kennedy’s time, which is now on an Air Force 
base in Ohio, which lead to hours pored over the original floor plans, 
and breaking down witness accounts and photos of President Johnson’s 
swearing-in ceremony.

After measuring out the tiniest details- like the 18 inches he allotted 
for each of the passenger rows- Mr Massey had found the X that marked 
the historic spot.

Sombre arrival: The body of President Kennedy is removed from the plane at Andrews Air Force base in D.C.

President Johnson was standing at 96 
degrees, 50 minutes, 49.85 seconds of west longitude and 32 degrees, 50 
minutes, 42.22 seconds of north latitude when he was sworn in.

Though
the architects have not yet determined how they will memorialise this 
exact location- FAA restrictions limit the options given that the runway
is still in constant use- they at least now know where to look when 
thinking back to that day.

Historians are thinking of other ways that the city can plan ahead to tastefully embrace the event that has long marred Dallas' past.

In preparation for the 50th anniversary in 2013, the city is proposing a refurbishment of Dealey Plaza, the road where the presidential motorcade was driving as President Kennedy was shot.  Organizers plan to host a large event there on the anniversary, and are hoping to raise $2.2million for the road’s restoration.

'I don't want to interpret for anyone the events, whether there was a conspiracy or not,' said Willis Winters, who works in the design and construction office of the Dallas park and recreation department.

'What I do want to achieve is that Dealey Plaza is in pristine condition so that when millions of people come there, they're going to see a well-restored site — not peeling paint, broken light fixtures and broken-up side walks,’ Mr Winters told The Los Angeles Times.

In the past, the city has almost shunned its association with the shooting, with some citizens feeling a sense of guilt that they let an extremist go about his evil plan with no safeguard.

Formal ceremonies on the November 22 anniversary have been avoided in the past, with the city sometimes saying that it is at the request of the Kennedy family.

The lack of festivities has not 
stopped the tourists from coming to the city to pay homage, however, as 
the Sixth Floor Museum hosted 330,000 visitors in 2010 from 133 
countries.

The past fifty 
years have come with significant change to Dallas, and many of the 
people who were there that day have greyed, died, or moved away.

The city is now becoming less and less of a cowboy-hat-and-big-hair-city and is being branded more as an urban metropolis, in fitting with the fact that it is now the fourth largest city in the country.

'Dallas is still scarred and wounded,' Sixth Floor Museum executive director Nicola Longford said to The LA Times.  

'For Dallas, this is an opportunity to look back and not ignore it, to move through it and be inspired,’ Ms Longford continued.

November 22, 196312.29pm Central Standard Time: The presidential motorcade turns onto Dealey Plaza in Dallas. The open-top limousine has a driver and security guard in the front row, Texas governor John Connally and wife Nellie Connally in the middle row, and President John F Kennedy and wife Jaqueline in the back row.

12.30pm: Witnesses testified that three shots were fired. The famous video recording of the event filmed by onlooker Abraham Zapruder shows that first Kennedy clutches his chest and seems to gasp before another shot hits his head. Governor Connally is also hit. Mrs Kennedy immediately begins climbing towards the back of the vehicle, apparently in an effort to grab part of the President's skull which flew back after he was shot. The Connallys reported that Mrs Kennedy said 'I've got his brains in my hand!'

12.33pm: Shooter Lee Harvey Oswald exits the Texas School Book Depository, where he fired the shots from a sixth floor window.

12.38pm: The presidential limo arrives at Parkland Hospital.
