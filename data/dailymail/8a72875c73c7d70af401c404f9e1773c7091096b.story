Shares in airlines and travel companies fell today amid the latest development in the spread of the deadly Ebola virus.

It came after a Spanish nurse contracted the disease in the first known transmission outside west Africa.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group - which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Vueling - fell by as much as 7 per cent, knocking £500million off its market value.

Big drop: British Airways owner International Airlines Group - which also owns Spain’s Iberia and Vueling - fell by as much as 7 per cent, knocking £500million off its market value

Low-cost airline: easyJet was down 5 per cent today, with the majority of its fall coming shortly after opening

Sinking: Cruise ship operator Carnival dropped 6 per cent, with the falls were likely to have been prompted by fears that the disease’s spread could cause major travel disruption

Low-cost rival easyJet was down 5 per cent while cruise ship operator Carnival fell 6 per cent, with travel agent TUI Travel down 4 per cent and Thomas Cook falling 5 per cent.

The falls were likely to have been prompted by fears that the disease’s spread could cause major travel disruption. But the wider market was already on the back foot amid disappointing data.

Traders may also have been looking for a trigger to take profits after airline shares were boosted in recent days following a profit expectation upgrade from easyJet and falling oil prices.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Robin Byde said the ‘volatile’ air stocks were always the first to be hit by this type of scare though there was no certainty of the outcome.

Travelling down: Thomas Cook fell 5 per cent. Health officials revealed today that there were no plans to screen travellers entering the UK for the Ebola virus

On the move: A team of scientists in Boston used air travel information to predict where the virus could reach in the next three weeks

He said: ‘You could be looking at worst case scenario major travel disruption, long haul and short haul. My view is that that looks unlikely but there is obviously concern in the market today.’

Keith Bowman, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the scare did seem to have provoked some nervousness in the travel sector.

But he added: ‘There does seem to have been a view that in the first-world countries the spread of the disease shouldn’t happen to any great degree given the sort of medical facilities we have got.’

Health officials revealed today that there were no plans to screen travellers entering the UK for the virus, as more than 100 Army medics prepared to travel to Sierra Leone to help tackle the epidemic.

Public Health England (PHE) said the overall risk of the virus to the UK remains ‘low’ and the country has ‘robust, well-developed and well-tested NHS systems for managing unusual infectious diseases’.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at PHE, said: ‘UK hospitals have a proven record of dealing with imported infectious diseases.

Three more people are under quarantine for possible Ebola at a Madrid hospital after a Spanish nursing assistant became infected there.

More than 50 other people are being monitored as experts try to understand why Spain's anti-infection practices failed.

Health authorities are investigating how the nursing assistant, part of a special team that cared for a Spanish priest who died of Ebola last month, became infected.

She was the first case of Ebola being transmitted outside of West Africa. 

Her case highlighted the dangers health care workers face while caring for Ebola patients - more than 370 health care workers in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have died.

‘If an Ebola case is repatriated to, or detected in, the UK they would receive appropriate treatment in an isolation unit, with all appropriate protocols promptly activated.’

Personnel from 22 Field Hospital, normally based in York, are expected to sent on their humanitarian operation to west Africa within the next few weeks.

They will staff a field hospital set up specifically to treat medics who have caught the disease, not members of the general public, and will operate a 12-bed facility.

The unprecedented Ebola outbreak this year has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, and become an escalating concern to the rest of the world.

British nurse William Pooley, who contracted the virus in Sierra Leone, survived after he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the Government was continuing to keep the issue of tighter travel restrictions under review after a Spanish nurse contracted Ebola, and three others were placed under quarantine, at a Madrid hospital.
