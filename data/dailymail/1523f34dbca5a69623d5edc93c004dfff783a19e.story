Disappointed England fans caused a 32 per cent surge in holiday searches last weekend as they rushed to book some time away.

Following England's 2-1 defeat against Uruguay and Italy's 1-0 loss against Costa Rica - ending our World Cup hopes - fans went straight online to book a summer trip.

According to statistics from Skyscanner, searches for holidays jumped 32 per cent compared to the week before the World Cup began, with Spain coming out as the most popular destination for a last-minute break.

Beach break: Football fans caused a 32 per cent boom in holiday bookings after England crashed out of the World Cup

While most people searched for a Spanish break, Italy and France also made it into the top three destinations.

And
 some football fans went all-out, booking a trip to the US for the 
holidays, with Greece also making it into the top five last-minute 
hotspots for summer.

However,
 there are plenty of people opting for a staycation this summer, perhaps
 prompted by the predicted good weather and the mild spring we 
experienced.

Holiday hotspots: The most popular destinations fro trips this summer, according to TripAdvisor

Looking
 at statistics taken from over the past months, TripAdvisor has found 
that six UK destinations have made it into the top 15 places for a 
summer break.

London and Edinburgh top the list in 
first and second place respectively, while Manchester, 
Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham also feature in the top 15.

And it 
seems that city breaks in general are proving a hit for British 
travellers as 11 of the top 15 are revealed to be city destinations.

Hotspot: While Spain is the most popular last-minute destination, Italy and France are close behind

Staying 
close to home is big on the agenda for UK travellers this summer as the 
top 15 is dominated by European destinations. Only four destinations in 
the hotlist this year are located outside of the continent â€“ Sharm El 
Sheikh, New York City, Orlando and Dubai.

For
 those planning to venture out of the UK, Sharm El Sheikh is the most 
popular holiday destination in third place, followed by New York City in
 fourth.

For
 those planning on going further afield, Sharm el Sheikh is the top 
destination, showing that despite Egypt's ongoing political crisis, 
British holidaymakers are not put off.
