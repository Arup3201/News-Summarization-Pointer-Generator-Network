Lord Justice Beatson has criticised the RSPCA during a court case over the investigation of a pair of a dog breeders whose animals were unlawfully inspected by the charity's officers

The RSPCA has been rapped by a High Court judge over a botched investigation into dog breeders suspected of causing unnecessary suffering to animals.

The trial of Deborah Fuller, 55, and Phil Sheldrake, 59, collapsed after it emerged the animal protection agency  used the wrong warrant to enter the couple's property in Lawford, Essex.

Senior judge Lord Justice Beatson today threw out an application by the RSPCA for judicial review of the decision to close the case - insisting it was important 'officers of the state' respected the restrictions on their powers.

The RSPCA was challenging a decision of district judge Kenneth Sheraton at Colchester Magistrates' Court in June last year blocking the prosecution.

Judge Sheraton excluded evidence obtained during a search of premises owned by Deborah Fuller, 55, and Phil Sheldrake, 59, who pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to dogs and failing to take reasonable steps to meet their needs.

The case related to 42 Ridgebacks and two Hamiltonstovare seized from Fuller and Sheldrake's house in  Lawford, Essex, in August 2013, when RSPCA inspectors accompanied officers from Tendring Council and the police on to their property.

The search led to RSPCA allegations that some 17 of the dogs were emaciated, six of them severely so, and one was suffering from a facial tumour.

All the dogs are currently being looked after by the RSPCA.

The trial was halted when it emerged that council officers had only obtained a search warrant to investigate complaints that the couple had caused a 'statutory nuisance' because of the noise of the dogs barking and the smell coming from faeces that had not been cleared up.

Judge Sheraton found there was no warrant issued allowing an inspection of the condition of the dogs.

The judge put down to 'inexperience and misunderstanding rather than malicious intent' that Fuller was advised that the EPA warrant permitted inspection of the dogs when it clearly did not.

The RSPCA applied to the High Court in London for judicial review, arguing that even if the 'dominant purpose' of the warrant granted under the EPA was to investigate a possible statutory nuisance, there was still scope for dogs found to be in poor condition to be seized and a criminal prosecution brought.

The RSPCA went to the High Court  to have the botched prosecution reviewed, but its claims were rejected

Dismissing the argument Lord Justice Beatson, sitting with Mr Justice Blake, said local council officers and the RSPCA had gone on to premises 'intent on carrying out a search for purposes for which they had not been authorised'.

Lord Justice Beatson said it was the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta and important to continue observing legal restrictions on 'officers of the state' - and bodies like the RSPCA acting with them - entering private land.

He said the case involved 'officers of the state aided by a well-funded charity, which does excellent work in many cases, using the power of the state to compulsorily enter land'.

He added: 'It is incumbent on officers of the state, and those who assist them in this way, to take care that the principle of legality that has protected us well over many centuries is observed'.
