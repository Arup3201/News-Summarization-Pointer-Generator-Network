A Tory MP who was caught up in the Commons brawl that saw Labour MP Eric Joyce arrested has  said the shamed politician was 'not in a good place'.

Tory backbencher Andrew Percy, one of 
those believed to have been caught up in the fracas yesterday, tweeted this 
morning that he felt 'sorry' for Joyce.

Insisting
he was 'fine' after the incident, the Brigg and Goole MP added: 'Tbh, I
sort of feel sorry for him. People in a good place don't act like that.
That's all I'll tweet on it!'

Mr Joyce was was last night charged with three counts of common assault after allegedly attacking seven people – including four MPs – in a House of Commons bar.

Eight police officers were said to have been called to the incident involving ex-Army major Eric Joyce.

Tory MP Stuart Andrew was left bleeding from the nose and suffering concussion after apparently being head-butted twice. Labour whip Phil Wilson also suffered a cut to his face.

Drinks in the House of Commons bar at the centre of the alleged bar brawl are heavily discounted thanks to a taxpayer subsidy.

Members can buy a pint of bitter for £2.40 or £2.95 for lager - considerably cheaper than prices in nearby Westminster pubs, which are closer to £4 a pint.

On spirits, MPs can enjoy a glass of whisky or Cointreau for just £2.55. And wine isn’t much more expensive - with wine by the glass from just £2.30, according to the Commons drinks menu.

MPs can chose from Sauvignon Blanc at £2.35 for a 125ml glass - compared with £3.00 at the nearest pub to the Commons the Red Lion in Whitehall or a small glass of Shiraz at £2.95, compared to £3.75.

Other offerings include a glass of vintage port at £2.65, a pint of Bulmer’s cider at £2.90 (£3.50 in the Red Lion) and a bottle of Commons Champagne Brut for £30.15 (£38.15 in the Red Lion).

The bar is generally open until 10pm but has been known to stay open until 3am or 4am.The Commons has nine bars, which took £1.33 million in the year to 2011 - £206,100 of which was from the Strangers’ bar.

Taxpayers forked out £5.8 million for the Commons catering service, which runs the bars last year despite pledges to bring down the cost.

The
drama unfolded in the Strangers’ Bar, where MPs had been entertaining 
guests including the Canadian Speaker and a group of children, on 
Wednesday evening.

Mr Joyce,
51, who was suspended from the Labour Party yesterday, was taken to 
Belgravia police station where he stayed overnight and was questioned 
until late last night.

After
he was charged, he was released on bail and driven away from the rear 
of the police station at around 11.20pm. He was sitting in the back of a
dark hatchback car, wearing a white shirt and dark suit and appeared 
pale and unshaven.

The MP will appear before West London magistrates on March 7.

Police were called just after 10.30pm following complaints from MPs in the Strangers’ Bar that one of Mr Joyce’s male guests was singing in a loud operatic voice.

Present in the bar were MPs from all parties including Tories Mr Andrew, Andrew Percy and Alec Shelbrooke and Labour members Mr Wilson and Graham Jones.

Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price was also there with a couple of her researchers and a Conservative councillor, Luke Mackenzie.

During the fracas, Mr Shelbrooke claims to have been hit in the head and Mr Wilson’s face was cut and blood was seen pouring all over his shirt.

Mr Mackenzie, a councillor in Basildon, said: ‘Two people were standing up and one guy was going for the other. I stepped in between them and I tried to break it up. Punches were flying everywhere. I have a swollen lip, but I am OK.’

One witness claimed: ‘It was horrific and shocking. There were tables overturned and drinks smashed everywhere. There was blood everywhere.

‘You would expect this on a lads holiday in Faliraki, but not in the Mother of Parliaments.’

Mr Andrew, who is understood to be pressing charges, yesterday tweeted: ‘I’m OK.’

Scotland Yard said: ‘We were called at approximately 10.50pm last night [Wednesday] to reports of a disturbance at a bar within the House of Commons.

‘A man aged in his 50s was arrested by officers on suspicion of assault. He remains in custody in a central London police station. Inquiries are continuing.’

The Labour Party said: ‘This is an extremely serious incident. We have suspended Eric Joyce pending the results of the police investigation.’

Speculation about the incident has been rife in Westminster but Commons Speaker John Bercow thwarted any attempt to raise the matter in the chamber by issuing a stern warning at the start of proceedings.

He told MPs: ‘Members will be aware of reports of a serious incident in the House last night. I have been informed by the Serjeant at Arms that the honourable member for Falkirk has been detained in police custody.

‘The matter is being investigated. I take this matter very seriously, as do the House authorities. I would ask that no further reference should be made to these reports in the Chamber today.’

If Mr Joyce is convicted of a criminal offence, it would trigger a by-election in his constituency.

The MP, who was elected in December 2000, has served as a senior aide to several Labour ministers including former Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth.

But he is understood to have had marriage problems and colleagues have been concerned that he had been drinking heavily in recent months. Before the incident, Mr Joyce was seen with two women.

In 2010, he resigned as Labour’s Northern Ireland spokesman after failing to provide a breath test.

He quit as the parliamentary private secretary to Mr Ainsworth in 2009 due to concerns over the war in Afghanistan.

The Strangers’ Bar has long been regarded as the rowdiest of the drinking establishments in the Palace of Westminster.

Late-night voting means that many MPs head to Strangers to gossip and plot until they can go home.

The bar stays open as long as the House of Commons sits – usually until 10pm, but sometimes well into the early hours, as late as 3am or 4am. On some occasions it has even stayed open 24 hours as debates carried on through the night.

The bar has gained a reputation as a rowdy environment because MPs from rival political parties often clash after a few drinks.

Some MPs have raised concerns about the heavy drinking culture in the Commons, where drinks are subsidised by taxpayers.

For example, in the Strangers’ Bar MPs can enjoy a pint of bitter for £2.40 or a lager for £2.95 – typically a third less than prices in nearby pubs in Westminster.

Records show that a total of £1.33million was spent in the House of Commons’s nine bars in the year to March 2011. The Strangers’ bar had takings of £206,100.

The taxpayer subsidy for the Commons catering service, which runs the bars, rose to £5.8million last year, despite promises to slash the cost of refreshing MPs.

It meant that for every £10 an MP spent on food and drink, the taxpayer added a top-up of £7.60.

The subsidy means MPs can enjoy a glass of whisky or a Cointreau liqueur after work for £2.55, or a glass of Merlot over lunch for £2.35.

Last year Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP and MP for Totnes, said some MPs are too drunk to stand up in debates and have ‘no idea’ what they are  voting for.

She said: ‘Who would go to see a surgeon who had just drunk a bottle of wine at lunchtime? But we fully accept that MPs are perfectly capable of performing as MPs despite some of them drinking really quite heavily.’

Tory MP Mark Reckless apologised for being too drunk to vote on George Osborne’s first Budget in 2010. He said: ‘I normally have just one or two and know when to stop. I don’t know what happened. I don’t remember falling over.

‘I remember someone asking me to vote and not thinking it was appropriate, given how I was at the time.’

Also in 2010 Labour MP Paul Farrelly admitted he wrestled a Commons newspaper seller in a corridor near Parliament’s Sports and Social Club bar. But he insisted his ‘John Prescott moment’ was an act of self-defence and he had not been drunk.

Public health minister Anne Milton recently said: ‘I think that Members of Parliament or people who work in jobs similar to the one that we do – fairly anti-social hours, often working at a distance from family – are susceptible to certain sorts of risky behaviour, and drinking and poor mental health are without doubt among them.’
