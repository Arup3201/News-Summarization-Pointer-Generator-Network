Fewer people than ever are going out to celebrate this year's festive season, with more and more choosing to party at home instead.

Rather than hitting bars, clubs or pubs, 70 per cent of British people now prefer to throw their own parties, where they can choose the music, mix their own cocktails, select the nibbles themselves and even save money.

And this rise of the 'sofa socialite' is happening fastest of all in Brighton, where more house parties are thrown than anywhere else in the country.

House party: More people than ever are choosing to 'go out' at home where they can choose the music, drinks and food themselves

Almost half of British people surveyed would prefer to attend a party at home with just a handful of close friends than one with a big group; nearly 20 per cent of us love throwing dinner parties; and 16 per cent consider pre-drinks at home the best part of a night out, according to new research.

Some two-thirds of party goers choose house parties because of the relaxed atmosphere, and over a half of us will party at home to save money.

As for where these house parties are happening, Brighton tops the poll, according to Funkin 100% Natural Cocktail Mixers, the brand that commissioned the research.

The seaside party town is followed closely by Aberystwyth, Swansea, Chelmsford and Southampton. More than half of Londoners said they prefer a cosy night in over a house party, quashing its status as the UK's party capital.

Of the 2,000 respondents, men proved to be the more spontaneous sex, happier than women to throw an impromptu house party. Women, meanwhile, considered having good food and drinks the key element to a good house party.

A spokesperson for Funkin 100% Natural Cocktail Mixers, who commissioned the research, said: 'We
have noticed a real change in the way people party at home now - with 
gatherings, pre-drinks, dinner parties and cosy nights in proving more 
popular than big house parties.

'Over this festive period people are 
partying more, and although everyone still loves a good night out we are
seeing them mix it up more by creating a similar experience in their 
own living room.â€™
