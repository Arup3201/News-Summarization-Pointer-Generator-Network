Strauss-Kahn had been charged by judges over alleged involvement in a vice ring that procured prostitutes

Dominique Strauss-Kahn was today on course to avoid all criminal charges relating to a prostitution ring because of ‘insufficient evidence’.

The former International Monetary Fund chief had been facing prison for ‘aggravated pimping’.

It was alleged that he and a number of other powerful Frenchmen had organised sex parties all over the world, using the Carlton Hotel in Lille as their base.

The so-called Carlton Affair saw Strauss-Kahn admit to attending many of the orgies, but he denied knowing that any of the women were prostitutes. 

Strauss-Kahn spent a night in prison during the enquiry, but prosecutors have now recommended that the case against him is dismissed. 

It is the latest in a string of legal victories for Strauss-Kahn, who once faced accusations that he tried to rape women in both New York and Paris. 

The 64-year-old, who was once tipped to become the Socialist President of France, figures prominently in the 6,800-page dossier into the Carlton Affair, but the judge in the case is now set to accept the prosecutors’ recommendation that there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution, and let him go. 

In 2011 Strauss-Kahn was accused by Nafissatou Diallo, a New York chamber maid, of trying to rape her.

Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn proved that a sex act which took place was consensual, but Strauss Kahn was forced to step down from his $500,000-a-year job at the IMF. 

Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn, but the two sides reached a financial settlement late last year, the details of which have never been disclosed.

Last October, a French prosecutor dropped a criminal investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible gang rape in Washington DC. 

A Belgian woman withdrew her allegations, and said she would not press charges, despite initially insisting she had been attacked by Strauss Kahn.

Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape two years ago when Tristane Banon, a young Paris writer, said he had tried to rape her in 2003.

But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations.

Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a counter claim in France, alleging slander.

Earlier this month, Strauss Kahn was involved in a fresh sex scandal, as claims emerged that he tried to assault an Italian television journalist in the late 1990s.

Myrta Merlino was forced to fight off the former IMF chief in a hotel room in Davos, it is alleged.

The allegations come just as the shamed economist begins to rehabilitate his damaged image.

Since his 20-year marriage to French journalist Anne Sinclair came to an end last year, Mr Strauss Kahn has been regularly seen with Moroccan-born TV press officer Myriam Aouffir, who is 20 years his junior.
