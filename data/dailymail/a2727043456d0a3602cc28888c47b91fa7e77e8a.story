Two men have been arrested after they broke into a vacant $1.5 million luxury mansion in Cape Coral, Florida, and partied with women they had invited to 'come on over' via a Craigslist ad.

Kyle Moss, 26, and Vincent Denillo, 24, were arrested on Friday after the home owner showed up to check on mail and found his property swarming with uninvited strangers.

Moss, a serial felon, was arrested for burglary and theft charges; while Denillo was arrested on drug charges.

Police say Moss broke into the property, located near the Cape Coral Yacht Club, several days ago via a back window, reports NBC2.

He then posted an ad on Craigslist entitled 'Chill at the mansion', which was an invitation to 'classy ladies' to come and party with the men who were ‘renting a nice place on the water.’

The riverfront Mansion has been on the market for three months and is listed at nearly $1.5 million. 

Homeowner Michael Przstanwik moved out months ago, but showed up to check the mail and was shocked to find young people living in his property.

‘I said, “excuse me, what's going on here.”  She said, “oh, I'm here partying with Kyle.”  I said, “Well, Kyle doesn't live here,”’ said Przstanwik.

Inside his property, Prstanwik said men and women had set up beds and brought enough clothes that suggest they planned on staying for some time.  He also said the squatters had been drinking.

The squatters' cars were parked in the driveway and Prstanwik told police he had let the air out of their tires so they couldn't escape.

Police quickly arrived and surrounded the home taking the two men into custody.  

Prstanwik says the damage to his property isn't too bad, although it will require a thorough cleanup before he can sell it.

The homeowner say the damages isn't too bad and the house is just more of a mess. He remains confident that he will sell it

Moss' bond was raised to $30,000 on Saturday morning. He faces charges including burglary and grand theft.

This is Moss' sixth time in jail and pervious offences have included drug possession and probation violations.

Denillo has posted bond.
