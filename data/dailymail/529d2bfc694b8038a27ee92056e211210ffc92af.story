A million pounds worth of luxury seaside chalets have been demolished after being condemned by a series of huge landslides.

The devastated owners were told by the local authority that the area was unsafe and had to salvage their belongings before bulldozers were brought in to level the chalets at Monmouth Beach in Lyme Regis, Dorset.

Each hut is worth about £70,000 but due to the seaside location and stunning coastal views, their sell-on value is between £175,000 to £200,000.

Gutted: Luxury seaside chalets worth an estimated one million pounds have been demolished after being condemned by a series of huge landslides

The devastated owners were told by the local authority that the area was unsafe and had to salvage their belongings before bulldozers were brought in to level the chalets

They were damaged after 500 tonnes of mud and earth pushed the buildings forward during the landslides.

The steady deluge built up behind the cabins and pushed them forwards until they were precariously perched on the sloping cliff, with one even tilted up at a 30 degree angle.

The landslide has rendered the stretch of Britain’s Jurassic Coast so unsafe it has been closed off to the public.

The huts, much sought-after thanks to the location, were heavily damaged by mudslides and condemned

Holiday nightmare:The beach below the chalets remains closed to the public

Up to 500 tonnes of sliding mud, caused by heavy rainfall, caused the damage

Lyme Regis Town Council, which owns the land, announced it will not renew the licences for 11 of the chalets.

One owner, speaking at the time, said: 'Some people are covered by insurance and some are not. Luckily for us our property is.

'We are only allowed to insure it up to £70,000. The total value of ours was £200,000 so the rest of the value is the location and the ongoing licence.

The beach remains closed to the public after huge landslides which has destroyed holiday homes

The owners of 18 chalets were allowed into their one-bed holiday homes one at a time to clear out their belongings after the disaster

The holiday homes, that overlook Lyme Bay, can only be lived in for nine months of the year and are empty over the winter.

They are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council which receives £2,500 a year in rent from each plot.

Monmouth Beach is named after the Duke of Monmouth, who landed there in 1685 during his attempt to take the crown from King James II.

Following the defeat of the Duke of Monmouth, twelve locals were hanged on the beach.

Some of the chalets are precariously perched on a cliff after mud built up behind the buildings and pushed them towards the sea
