A beautiful woman is said to inspire many things, but could the power of a pretty face or two propel a team to World Cup victory in 2014?

On Wednesday the first ladies of France supported their boys by dressing up in a rather more snug version of their team's official World Cup kit.

On this occasion the presence of the wives and the girlfriend's of the European team weren't able to ensure victory, as the team drew 0-0 in the Group E closer against Ecuador.  But there's no doubt that the girls put a smile on the face of their boys and the crowd.

Le WAGs: The wives of Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Mamadou Sakho, Bacary Sagna and Patrice Evra attended the French-Ecuador game in team colours

Proud: The WAGs show off the names on the back of their shirts as they pose for photographs

Selfie: The players' wives were in the crowd to give their support for the France team

The wives of Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, 
Mamadou Sakho, Bacary Sagna and Patrice Evra were seen posing for photographs ahead of the 
stalemate score.

Meanwhile Holland's coach Louis van Gaal treated his team to a day off with their families and girlfriends in Brazil after they qualified.

The Dutch squad and their manager enjoyed their rest day by the pool with their families before stepping up their preparations for the upcoming game against Mexico.

Chilled out: The Dutch players were joined by family and friends for some well-earned downtime

Norwich City's Leroy Fer even managed to escape to the beaches in Rio to spend some quality time with his girlfriend Xenia Lodia Maria, who wore a bikini by lingerie company Agent Provocateur.

One girl who has raised eyebrows as well as temperatures during the tournament is 22-yaer-old Italian WAG Fanny Neguesha.

It
 has been reported that Mario Balotelli’s Belgian girlfriend looked less than 
chuffed as she waited for transport to watch her man play.

Maybe
 it was because the Uruguay WAGs were next door in a five star residence
 while the Italian team base probably came in at a modest three stars at
 best.

Hot stuff: Leroy Fer and fiancee Xenia Maria take a walk on the beach in Rio on Holland's day off

Is that a text from Neil Adams? Fer could be in line for a move away from the Canaries after the World Cup

Not to worry: Fanny Neguesha and Mario Balotelli will return to Italy soon

Ciao bella: Novella Benini (top L), girlfriend of Italy's head coach Cesare Prandelli and (L-R) Fanny Neguesha, fiancee of Mario Balotelli, Federica Riccardi, girlfriend of Italy's Alessio Cerci and Valentina Abate, wife of Italy's Ignazio Abate, smile in the stands prior to the group D preliminary round match between Italy and Uruguay

Meanwhile,
 with the exception of Coleen Rooney, the WAGs of the unfortunate 
England team decided not to bother visiting Brazil to watch their other 
halves take part. Maybe they knew something the fans didn't.

Coleen,
 28, did her best to represent the English ladies, dressing her two sons 
with England striker Wayne in patriotic colours even after the team 
struck out.

But
 even the sight of four-year-old Kai and his 13-month-old brother watching from the stands couldn't put a smile on the English crowd's
 faces and Mrs Rooney ended up returning home much sooner than we all hoped for..

The final countdown: Coleen Rooney pictured with son Kai at the Minerao Stadium for the match against Costa Rica

Excess baggage: Coleen Rooney arrived back at Manchester airport with a load of suitcases after England was knocked out of the World Cup

Short trip: Coleen had packed for a long stay but she needn't have bothered
