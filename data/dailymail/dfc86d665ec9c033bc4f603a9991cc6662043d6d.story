Being a world leader is a tiring and demanding job.

So it's no surprise that having to travel around the globe on a regular basis, heads of state like to enjoy a bit of luxury on their 'down time'.

Brisbane, Australia, is the host city for this weekend's G20, with US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Russian Premier Vladimir Putin, among others, all staying in the Queensland city.

Barack Obama will be staying at the Marriott Hotel in Brisbane for the G20 summit

Obama's £1,370-a-night suite should help relax the US president after his meetings

Obama might well be hoping he gets chance to relax in the pool at the Marriott

And it is Obama who has set the bar with his hotel booking this year.

The US President will base himself at the £1,370 (AUS$2,500) a night Marriott Hotel on Queen Street. 

The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms, 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space.

A buffet breakfast will set you back £19 (AUS$35). But for the same price Obama might want to feel 'more at home' and opt for the full American breakfast.

His room, rather aptly, is the presidential suite on the top floor, with a king size bed and 131 square metres of room to play with. Panoramic views of Brisbane River should de-stress him after his meetings.

Obama should get a good night's sleep at least ahead of his tense meetings

The views over dinner are breathtaking of Brisbane River and beyond

Elegant marble bathrooms, and indulgent bedding, should guarantee the US President's stay at the top Brisbane hotel is a relaxing one.

US President Barack Obama will stay in the presidential suite at the Marriott Hotel.

Cost - £1,370 (AUS$2,500) a night.

China President Xi Jinping will stay in the Stamford suite at the Stamford Plaza. 

Cost - £925 (AUS$1,695) a night.

UK Prime Minister David Cameron will stay at a suite in the Treasury Hotel.

Cost - £690 (AUS$1,259) a night.

Burma President Thein Sein will stay at the signature suite at Gambaros.

Cost - £650 (AUS$1,180) a night.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will stay at the Hilton in a king suite.

Cost - £335 (AUS$615) a night.

Saudia Arabia King Abdullah will stay at the manor suite at the Gold Coast Sanctuary Cove.

Cost - £270 (AUS$495) a night.

Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott will stay at a deluxe king suite at Rydges.

Cost - £170 (AUS$309) a night. 

However, his room may not appear quite the same as that described in the hotel brochure.

Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon.

Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls. 

The award-winning Dome Spa Retreat delivers an unrivalled spa experience. Also onsite are Motion Bar & Grill, a modern restaurant with an open kitchen plan and outdoor seating, and M Bar, a high-style bar. 

Obama's room also features executive lounge access. Complimentary food of hors d'oeuvres and dessert can be supplemented by complimentary non-alcoholic beverages.

Not far behind in the outlay stakes is Chinese President Xi Jinping who has decided to stay in the £925 (AUS$1,695) a night Stamford Suite at the Stamford Plaza. 

He gets more for his money in terms of space than Obama, with 250sqm to enjoy, and a baby grand piano thrown in for good measure.

A spa bath overlooking the river and a private, heated terrace will all help relax Mr Jinping.

UK Prime Minister David Cameron will rest up at the £690 (AUS$1,259) a night suite at the Treasury Hotel, with eloquent polish timber panelling.

Other leaders present are, L-R, Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak and New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key

The £650 (AUS$1,180) a night suite at the Gambaros is the selection of Burma President Thein Sein, attending as a UN representative. 

For his money, Mr Sein will get a two-king bedroom suite, both with rainfall showers, as well as having a balcony each in one of Brisbane's newer developments.

Russian leader Vladimir Putin will stay in the slightly-less salubrious surroundings of the Hilton in the £335 (AUS$615) a night king suite, while Saudia Arabia King Abdullah beds down in the £270 a night (AUS$495) Manor Suite at the Sanctuary Cove on the Gold Coast. 

Maybe he has some insider information, but Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's selection of the £170 a night (AUS$309) deluxe king suite with a river view at Rydges is thrifty compared to some of the other leaders' choices.

The best of the rest sees German Chancellor Angela Merkel staying at the relatively modest Four Points, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be joined at the Sofitel by France's President Francois Hollande.

Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo has perhaps selected the cheapest stays off all, with a room booked at the £110 a night (AUS$200) Novotel.

Vladimir Putin will stay in the Hilton Hotel, which has its own chic style

The rooms at the Hilton may not be as expensive as Obama's but are sharp and classy

Rydges Hotel certainly stands out, and is where Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott is booked in for

Despite Australia PM Tony Abbott's choice of the more affordable Rydges hotel, it retains elements of class

Security agencies are scanning the city 24 hours a day and barricades have been going up around the restricted zones where dignitaries will be meeting and sleeping.

Special G20 laws came into force on Friday evening and one man has been already been banned from the area.

He was charged after allegedly refusing to provide police with his details after taking photos of the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday night.
