The disappearance of Air Malaysia MH370 has officially been declared an accident with all on board presumed dead so families can be awarded compensation

Despite months of searches, investigators have failed to find any trace of the aircraft and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) has now ruled that the disappearance accidental

DCA director-general Azharuddin Abdul Rahman said: 'We officially declare Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 an
accident... and that all 239 of the passengers and crew onboard
MH370 are presumed to have lost their lives. 

The announcement is in accordance with standards of annexes
12 and 13 in the International Civil Aviation, said Azharuddin. 

It will allow families of the passengers to obtain assistance
through compensation, he said.

Malaysia Airlines is ready to proceed immediately with compensation to next-of-kin of passengers on the
flight, he said.

International investigators are still looking into why the jet veered thousands of miles off course from its scheduled
route before eventually plunging into the Indian Ocean. Malaysia is also conducting a criminal investigation.

'Both investigations are limited by the lack of physical
evidence at this time, particularly the flight recorders,' said
Azharuddin.

'Therefore, at this juncture, there is no evidence to
substantiate any speculations as to the cause of the accident.'

The DCA plans to release an interim report on the
investigation into the missing jetliner on March 7, a day before
the first anniversary of the disappearance.

'This declaration is by no means the end,' said Azharuddin,
adding that it will continue with the search for the missing
plane with assistance from China and Australia.

Malaysia airline's crisis deepened on July 17 when Flight MH17, on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was
shot down over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.
