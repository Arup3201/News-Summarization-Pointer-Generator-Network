Chancellor George Osborne has denied claims that an Independent Scotland could keep the pound

George Osborne today rubbished claims that Scotland could keep the British pound even if it votes for independence later this year.

The Chancellor denied suggestions made in a newspaper report which quoted an unnamed UK government minister as saying that if Scotland voted 'yes' to independence, a currency union would 'eventually' be agreed to ensure mutual economic stability.

Scottish nationalists want to share the pound in a currency union with the UK and retain the services of the Bank of England. But the three main UK parties have united to reject that plan.

The Guardian newspaper quoted the minister as saying a currency union will eventually be agreed between an independent Scotland and the rest of Britain to ensure economic stability on both sides of the border.

'Of course there would be a currency union,' the minister told the paper. 'You simply cannot imagine Westminster abandoning the people of Scotland.

'Saying no to a currency union is obviously a vital part of the No campaign. But everything would change in the negotiations if there were a Yes vote.'

The source also suggested a deal could be struck allowing the UK to retain their nuclear weapons base at Faslane in exchange for allowing Scotland to retain the pound.

He added: 'There would be a highly complex set of negotiations after a 'yes' vote, with many moving pieces.

'The UK wants to keep Trident nuclear weapons at Faslane and the Scottish government wants a currency union - you can see the outlines of a deal.'

Scottish leader Alex Salmond has 
repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from 
Faslane on the river Clyde if Scots back independence.

Should Scotland be allowed to stay in a currency union with UK if it splits?

However Mr Osborne insisted: 'There 
will not be a currency union in the event of independence. The only way 
to keep the UK pound is to stay in the UK. Walking out of the UK means 
walking out of the UK pound.

'A currency union will not work because it would not be in Scotland's interests and would not be in the UK's interests.

'Scotland
 would have no control over mortgage rates, and would be binding its 
hands on tax and funding for vital public services.

'The Scottish Government are proposing to divorce the rest of the UK but want to keep the joint bank account and credit card.

'The
 UK would not put its taxpayers at risk of bailing out a foreign country
 and its banks. Parliament wouldn't pass it, and the people wouldn't 
accept it.

'Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.'

Pledge: Scottish leader Alex Salmond has repeatedly insisted that nuclear weapons would be removed from their Faslane base on the river Clyde if Scots back independence

Polls show the question of what currency
 an independent Scotland would use has been high in Scottish voters' 
minds ahead of an independence referendum on Sept. 18.

Many 
north of the border worry about the economic uncertainties a new currency would bring if 
they voted to end the 300-year-old union with England.

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael
 said: 'An anonymous, off the record quote does not change the stark 
reality on the currency.

'The
 UK Government has listened to the views of the governor of the Bank of 
England and the independent advice of the Permanent Secretary to the 
Treasury that a currency would be damaging for all the United Kingdom.

Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the minister's comments gave a big boost to the Yes campaign

'That's why a currency union simply will not happen.

'The Scottish Government should remove the uncertainty on the currency by coming forward with a plan B.'

The minister's comments were seized on by Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said they gave a big boost to the Yes campaign.

She said: 'This was supposed to be the No campaign's trump card, but as the polls show it has backfired badly - the gap between Yes and No has halved since November, and most Scots simply do not believe the bluff and bluster we had from George Osborne, Ed Balls and Danny Alexander.

'Now that the card has been withdrawn, it gives an even bigger boost to the Yes campaign. And it can only add to the sense of crisis which is engulfing the No campaign.

'The reality is that a currency union is every bit as much in the interests of the rest of the UK as an independent Scotland, and that is why Westminster will agree to one.

'Scotland is the rest of the UK's second biggest trading partner, and not sharing sterling would cost businesses south of the border an extra Â£500 million in transaction costs.'

She added: 'The leader of the No campaign, Alistair Darling, said that a shared sterling area between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK is 'desirable' and 'logical' - and now the UK Government appears to have U-turned and actually agrees with that sensible position.'

The Scottish Government's White Paper on independence, published last November, says a shared currency is in the 'economic interests' of Scotland and the rest of the UK.

Almost half of voters north of the border think that Mr Osborne's pledge to rule out a formal currency union with an independent Scotland is a bluff, according to a poll published this week.

A YouGov poll for The Times newspaper suggests 45 per cent of Scots do not believe the Chancellor's threat is real, compared with 40% who think he means what he says.
