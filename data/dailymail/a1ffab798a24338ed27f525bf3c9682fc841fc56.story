From private conversations between the President and the First Lady, to the chilling moment terrorists crashed into the World Trade Center, photographer Eric Draper captured every aspect of George W Bush's presidency.

As official photographer for the White House Mr Draper had unparalleled access to President Bush and was able to photograph crucial political moments as well as more intimate scenes.

Stunning images show the former president in his rise to political success, with his family and at moments of crisis over nearly a decade.

Mr Draper told ABC: ‘My job was not to be a distraction. My job was to purely document. That was a very unique role in the White House; to have that much access to the president and not to be a participant in the meetings, but to be an observer.’

His photographs, which have been compiled into a book entitled Front Row Seat: A Photographic Portrait of the Presidency of George W. Bush, show different sides to Mr Bush.

Eric Draper was present for tense moments of George W Bush's presidency including the moment a plane crashed into the World Trade Center

A striking pair of pictures show the moment the former president is alerted to a terrorist plane crashing into the twin towers.

Mr
Draper said: '9/11 was off the charts, it was a rollercoaster of 
emotion.

'I knew I had a job to do that day - focus on capturing those 
moments. I used it as a distraction.'

But Mr Draper was also able to capture the more boyish and fun-loving side to Mr Bush.

On a visit to Buckingham Palace he recalled how the former president and his wife posed for a photo on an enormous plush red seat.

‘The president and the
First Lady are sitting on this very large couch in Buckingham Palace.

'And what’s neat about Buckingham Palace is that it’s just like the White
House, except everything’s bigger,’ he said.

‘They
were like kids, they were having fun.

'They were guests of the Queen, 
and they’re about to leave for a black-tie dinner that night. '

So they 
were walking around, and they were like, "Oh, Eric, come over and take 
our picture on this couch". And so it made for a fun moment.'

In another image Mr Bush is photographed wearing a boxing robe with his name emblazoned on the back in the White House.

Mr Draper said: ‘In that
image, he’s opening the Oval Office door looking through the hallway to
see if anyone’s walking around, because he really wanted to show it 
off.

'A lot of those moments I had to wait, just hang out and wait, and luckily I was there to capture that funny moment.'
