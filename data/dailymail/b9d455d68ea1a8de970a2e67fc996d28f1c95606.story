The axe-wielding radical Muslim who hacked two cops in Queens two week ago spent months viewing jihadist material online and stalked police  for hours before launching his attack, it is claimed.

Detectives piecing together the life of Zale Thompson, 32, say in the nine months before his attack on October 23 he visited 277 websites to do with ISIS, beheadings, Al Qaeda, and jihad. 

Thompson was shot dead after running up to four officers in New York brandishing a hatchet, before wounding cop Kenneth Healey, 25, in the head, and slashing another in the arm.

Mr Healey was taken to hospital on in critical condition but has now been released.

Investigators say Thompson stalked cops for hours in New York before launching his assault as they were having their pictures taken - wounding Kenneth Healey (second left) in the head 

Mr Healey, a rookie who had been on the force for just four months before he was injured, was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since recovered

Officers have also discovered CCTV footage which shows that Thompson stalked his victims for hours before deciding on the perfect moment to strike, according to ABC.

An anonymous police source told the site: 'There’s video, very distant, about two blocks up, that shows him at the top of the frame. 

'He stays there about two minutes. Then he bends over and bolts, charges down the street, charging at the cops with the ax. You can see him watching, down the block.'

Investigators said this dismisses concerns that a man photographing the four cops seconds before the attack had set them up, as Thompson simply used the distraction to his advantage.

Officers have also discovered a manifesto on Thompson's computer, in which he details his hatred of the government and desire to attack an establishment figure.

In it, he writes: 'Seek them out, watch them and then attack them. Chop off the head of the beast. If we can’t do it "there," we have to do it here.' 

Thompson can be seen dead on the street, face up in a green coat, moments after attacking the officers. Kenneth Healey is laying face down with a hatchet gash in his head

Mr Healey, his head and left hand bandaged, left hospital last Wednesday to cheers from his fellow officers - and even managed to step out of his wheelchair and walk into a waiting ambulance.

He is now in a therapy centre where he will complete his physio treatment before rejoining the force.

Chilling pictures taken seconds before the October 23 attacks show Mr Healy standing along with four fellow officers before they were attacked by Thompson.

Dominick Williams took the photos after spotting the officers and asking them to stand for a picture.  

Seconds later, Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand axe.

Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before burying the hatchet in Healey's skull.

Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. 

Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head.  

Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the head wound.

The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk. His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest. 

NYPD top brass has called the attack 'an act of terrorism.' Thompson was a self-radicalized Muslim extremist who had an interest in ISIS beheadings. 

His family described him as a 'recluse' with mental health problems.
