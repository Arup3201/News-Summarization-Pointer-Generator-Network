Media demands: Lord O'Donnell told the Leveson inquiry today that David Cameron's links with the media were 'too close' while in opposition

David Cameron became too close to the media while he was in opposition, former cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell said today.

Lord O'Donnell - who retired as head of the civil service at the end of last year - said he tried to ensure ministers maintained a distance from the press.

But, giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, he admitted that he had not always been successful.

'I think the Prime Minister himself, the current Prime Minister, has said that he felt his relationships had got too close, and I agree with that.'

Mr Cameron admitted last July that he and other politicians had allowed themselves to get 'too close' to media proprietors and editors, and he has since said that relations were 'too cosy'.

However, he has stressed that his contacts were not only with Rupert Murdoch's News International, but with a wide range of media organisations.

Lord O'Donnell also said today that Andy Coulson should have declared a £40,000 shareholding in News Corp when being vetted so he could have unsupervised access to top secret material.

In his evidence, Lord O'Donnell said that while in opposition parties should have a different relationship with journalists than Government ministers.

He said: 'You have much fewer resources, so you do not have big press offices and the like, so you do tend to make closer personal relationships with journalists.

'There tends to have been swapping of mobile phone numbers, all of those sorts of things.'

Lord O'Donnell said MPs should be 'much more careful' once their party forms a government.'Every
single Secretary of State is subject to collective responsibilities 
much more important in government than we see in opposition. We have to 
be much more careful,' he said.

He added that a lot of special advisers come from a media or PR background.

The peer said that the inquiry had 
an opportunity to issue guidelines specifically for opposition parties 
on their relationships with the press.

'I
think you would want to put it to the leaders of all the parties, "Here
is a set of rules that we think opposition parties should abide by", he
said.

Lord O'Donnell 
said he had suggested to David Cameron that all meetings between Ministers and newspaper 
editors and owners should be recorded in a transparency drive.

However, 
he said it would not be right to record all discussions between MPs and 
journalists because they are part of the 'basic lifeblood' of 
parliamentary life.

He said editors 'are different because of the ability to very strongly support different political parties.'

News Corp shares: Andy Coulson told the Leveson inquiry he held £40,000 worth of shares while he was Mr Cameron's press secretary in No 10 - and didn't realise the potential conflict of interest until afterwards

The former head of the civil service also said that Andy Coulson should have revealed his News Corp shareholding.

Mr Coulson admitted to the inquiry on Friday that he held £40,000 worth of shares while he was Mr Cameron's press secretary in No 10.

He said he only realised the potential conflict of interest after he left Downing Street.

He said in his witness statement: 'I was never asked about any share or stock holdings and because I knew that I wasn't involved in any commercial issues, including the BSkyB bid, it never occurred to me that there could be a conflict of interest.

'In retrospect I wish I had paid more attention to it.'

However, Lord O'Donnell said Mr Coulson was asked to sign a form 
declaring any outside interests when he entered Downing Street but the shareholding was not disclosed -
although it should have been.

A decision was taken to vet him so he could have unrestricted access to secret materials after the airline bomb plot when printer cartridges packed with explosives were found on planes.

Lord O'Donnell said Mr Coulson needed more access to top secret documents.

The press secretary already had undergone a full security check giving him substantial access to secret materials and supervised access to top secret materials.

Questions have been raised about why Mr Coulson was cleared only to SC level 'security checked' in No 10, rather than the tougher DV or 'developed vetting' level.

Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell was given the higher level of security clearance when he was in Downing Street.

Lord O'Donnell said he had been keen to keep the numbers of people given the highest vetting to a minimum, to help avoid leaks.

He added that he didn't know whether other former press secretaries had been cleared to DV level.

The ex-News of the World editor resigned before the process was complete.

He also pointed out that DV was designed to establish 'whether you are blackmailable... in terms of your position or your personal life'.

'It would not have gone into enormous detail about phone hacking, for example,' Lord O'Donnell said.

Exit: Jeremy Hunt's special adviser Adam Smith who resigned last month after admitting that the contacts over the BSkyB bid had become too close

Lord O'Donnell said that Jeremy Hunt's aide Adam Smith should have dealt with the BSkyB fairly.

Mr Smith resigned last month after 
admitting that the contacts over the BSkyB bid had become too close. 
Labour has been demanding that Mr Hunt quit for allowing the situation 
to get out of control.

Lord O'Donnell said it was for 
ministers to authorise their special advisers' activities, but there was
not likely to be a written record of instructions.

'I would have expected the minister to be clear about what his special adviser should be doing,' he said.

He insisted that 'keeping all parties informed about process is perfectly reasonable, but not getting into substance'.

He added that reviewing the bid was a 'quasi-judicial procedure' and there was an obligation to deal with it fairly.

Lord O'Donnell said he was right to tell Gordon Brown not to launch an inquiry into media standards in the weeks before the general election.

He said that if a probe was launched it should have been done with all-party agreement - which would have been difficult in March 2010.

'There were stories that there was more information out there and I think there was still a question mark as to whether more would emerge ...

'On the basis of what we knew then I would stick with that recommendation.'

Asked whether he had been unwilling to pick up a 'hot potato', the peer replied: 'I would say it was clearly a big potato. The timing was not ideal.

'If you are going to do this it would be good to have all-party agreement. Trying to broker such a thing in the weeks leading up to a general election would be quite difficult.'

'Forgetful': Rupert Murdoch was accused of 'selective amnesia' over a key 1981 meeting as he bought The Times

News International hit out today at 'fantasy' allegations made about Rupert Murdoch's 'sinister' back-room dealings with politicians.

Robert Jay QC, counsel for the Leveson Inquiry, was accused of 'headline grabbing' by suggesting the media mogul was suffering 'selective amnesia' about his discussions with Margaret Thatcher.

The idea that the pair had made an implicit pact over lunch in 1981 to allow his purchase of The Times was a 'science fiction theory', according to the company's barrister Rhodri Davies QC.

'This is the stuff of fantasy,' he told Lord Justice Leveson. 'Deals cannot be done through telepathy. What are the terms? What is the duration, what is the quid pro quo?'

Mr Davies said the documentary record had no evidence of an explicit or implicit deal to exchange favourable media coverage for favourable treatment.

Mr Murdoch also had no reason to lie about having no recollection of the key lunch at Chequers, as Mr Jay suggested last week in 'headline-grabbing style', he added.

'It is against the rules, and for good reason, to raise such an issue after the witness has gone, rather than when he is here to answer for it, but never mind that,' Mr Davies said.

'Mr Murdoch has nothing to lie about. The documents tell the story.'

Mr Davies accused Mr Jay of suggesting it was 'sinister' for newspapers such as The Sun to back politicans they agree with.

'That is exactly what they are meant to do, and are expected to do, as agents of a free press in a democracy,' he said.

'In Mr Jay's hands, the characteristics of a large readership, floating voters, an absence of immutable party loyalties, begin to sound sinister.'
