Vintage: Mort Bank sold a gallon of 1992 McDonald's McJordan sauce on eBay for more than £6,000.

If you're dining in upmarket restaurants of the kind owned by superstar chefs like Gordan Ramsay, you expect to pay for the privilege.

But one well-heeled shopper with a thing for fast food decided he would rather spend $10,000 - about £6,000 - of his hard-earned cash on an old tub of McDonald's sauce.

The condiment - a creation named McJordan sauce after basketball star Michael Jordan - languished on auction site eBay for months.

Then seller Mort Bank added a 'Buy it now' price and shopper's mouths started to water.

Mort told North Dakota's Bismarck Tribune: 'I had this barbecue sauce on the shelf for 20 years.

'It’s probably edible.'

It might not taste as fresh as when it was made though.

Mort, who owned five McDonald’s restaurants in Bismarck-Mandan and two in Minot, saved the sauce after selling his restaurants in 1996.

'It was in my basement and I would look at it occasionally,' he said.

'I thought it would be worth something some day.'

It was only sold in Chicago and Minneapolis. Jordan famously played for the Chicago Bulls. Mort’s ad on eBay for the sauce read: 'A once in a lifetime chance to own the rarest of rare Michael Jordan and McDonald's collectible!'

He thinks it is the only tub of it's kind still about.

'I don’t imagine anybody else has one,' he said.

The McJordan was a quarter-pound hamburger with smoked bacon, cheese, McJordan barbecue sauce, onions, mustard and pickles.

Bank claimed the sauce also is special because Jordan was the first person to have a McDonald’s sandwich named after him.

Hungry to win: The sauce was for the first burger named after anyone - the McJordan. It contained a quarter-pounder, smoked bacon, cheese, McJordan barbecue sauce, onions, mustard and pickles.

He tried to sell the sauce by auction for four months before he switched to a fixed 'Buy it Now' price.

'All of a sudden everybody was looking at it,' he said.

The buyer is from Chicago. Mort thought he was probably a Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fan.

The Bismarck Tribune said Mort still has 'at least three storage units' full of McDonald’s memorabilia he has been trying to shift on eBay for three years.

His daughter, Margaux Braun of Fargo, writes the words and takes the pictures.

He sells and ships them. Items have gone to China, Japan, Brazil and around Europe.

The McJordan sauce was his most expensive item.

'I'm pretty ecstatic,' he said.

'You never know what is going to be a hot item.'

Happy Meal toys are popular.

After selling his stores he had a lot left.

'A lot of them are unopened,' he said.

'I saved them instead of throwing them away.'

At the moment he is eBaying a McDonald’s edition 'Wayne's World' VHS tape, a Hamburglar flag and a Ronald McDonald alarm clock.

'If I didn't start selling them I'd be sticking the kids with them,' he said.

'I decided I should start lowering the inventory for the kids' sake.'
