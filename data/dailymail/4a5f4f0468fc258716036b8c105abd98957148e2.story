The international players' union wants FIFA to investigate why a Club World Cup match was played on a potentially dangerous rain-soaked field in Morocco.

FIFPro says letting the Cruz Azul vs Western Sydney Wanderers quarter-final match continue in Rabat on Saturday 'posed a serious threat to the health and safety of all players.'

The Mexican club won 3-1 in extra time with players splashing through large puddles.

Cruz Azul won the match against Western Sydney 3-1, setting up a semi-final with Real Madrid 

FIFPro official Tijs Tummers said 'players as workers have a right to a safe work environment,' adding FIFA must ensure 'effective rules are in place to prevent a repetition.'
