The world’s most ambitious initiative to return captive-born animals to the wild began last week when six Javan langurs and a gibbon were transported to Indonesia from Kent.

It is the first time these primates have been reintroduced into their natural forest habitat in Java to boost the ‘vulnerable’ indigenous population.

The ‘repatriation’ is part of Damian Aspinall’s campaign, Back To The Wild 2013. As head of the charitable Aspinall Foundation, the conservationist wants to end the suffering of wild animals kept in zoos and bolster the population of endangered species.

Six captive-born Javan langurs and a gibbon have been transported from Kent to Indonesia

This year he will reintroduce record 
numbers of animals – including 11 Western Lowland gorillas into Congo 
and Gabon, two bull elephants and more primates to the wild.

The langurs, right, were born at his 
Kent wildlife parks Howletts and Port Lympne, while the gibbon was born 
in Australia before becoming part of the Aspinall breeding programme.

‘We launched the initiative because I believe we have an obligation to our animals,’ said Aspinall, 52.

‘I don’t believe exhibiting wild 
animals for entertainment is right. I think the world has moved on. My 
aim is to change the consciousness of the public.’

His foundation has an impressive 
record. There have been births of 139 gorillas, 33 black rhinos, 20 
African elephants and 28 Javan gibbons at the parks.

Aspinall says his wish is that one day his two animal parks no longer exist ‘because there was no need for them any more.’

The son of the legendary gambler, John Aspinall, Damian, 52, grew up at Howletts, a Palladian mansion in Kent which was filled with his father’s pets which included a leopard and a Himalayan bear.

Howletts eventually became a wildlife park which Damian took control of after his father’s death, in 2000, and turned into a leading conservation charity. Like his father before him, he has a genuine love of wild animals.

As we talk, a five month old tiger cub, Kasimir, pads around the study.  Unlike his father, however, Damian will do everything in his power to make sure his charge eventually lives life in the wild not a cage.

He said: ‘We have written to the Russian ambassador as we’re hoping we might be able to introduce our tigers there. We have one person whose job it is solely to look for ways and places to reintroduce animals into the wild.

‘We launched the initiative because I believe we have an obligation to our animals. I don’t believe that exhibiting wild animals for human entertainment is right. I think the world has moved on. My aim is to change the consciousness of the public. We’ve grown up in a culture where it’s normal to take our children to the zoo. We’ve been brought up to believe that it’s perfectly OK to go and see these animals in captivity for the pleasure of man.'

‘Why do we feel we can sentence these animals to life imprisonment? And with no pardon.  For that’s what we’re doing and what right do we have to do that?  For me, I can’t accept that. Not if we want to be proud of ourselves as a species. Under UK law it’s legal to capture a wild elephant and bring into England. How is that acceptable? People need to demand change, write to their local institutions, their local MPs.  I’m not naive, it will take time - maybe 20 years - but I hope in time there will be real change.’ 

His foundation has an impressive conservation record - there have been 139 gorilla births, 33 black rhinos (currently an endangered species) 20 African elephants, 28 Javan Gibbons and 24 Javan langurs.  Their work could save these species from extinction. 

Reintroducing the animals to the wild is a long and involved process.  Last week’s ‘repatriation’ has been eight years in the planning - from the initial finding of the land for their reserves in East and West Java to working with the local government to preparing the animals for their journey and, ultimately, the wild.

The primates’ journey began last Thursday when they were flown from Heathrow to Singapore and then onto Jakarta. They then travelled for five hours on a truck and were then carried for half an hour on bamboo poles, down the mountain to the Aspinall Foundation centre in Bandung.  They will then have to be acclimatised before being released later in the year.

Damian said: ‘We have to spend some months conditioning the animals although life is so different there’s only so much you can do. They’ll be introudced to local fruits and local leaves and we’ll also mix them with wild caught primates who will hopefully teach them the ways of the forest.  In Indonesia gibbons and langurs are status symbols and are often kept in small cages in people’s gardens.  We’ve been working with the Government to rescue them and then, like our primates, we hope to release them back to the wild.’

Two further langurs, which have been held back as they had worms - all animals must be given a clean bill of health before they are reintroduced to the will.  They will follow shortly, then it will be the turn of the gorillas, the elephants... and so many more.

It is a challenge but one which Damian will never give up on while so many species are perilously close to extinction and there are still wild animals in captivity.  His greatest wish is that his two greatest achievements - Howletts and Port Lymne - no longer exist. He said: ‘Yes, because if there was no need for them anymore I would die a happy man.’
