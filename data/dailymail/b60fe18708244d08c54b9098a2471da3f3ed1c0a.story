The number of children in the UK who have non-British parents has soared, with almost nine in ten babies born in 2012 born to at least one foreign parent.

Just three in 10 London babies born in 2012 had both parents born in the UK, and in three London boroughs, as few as one fifth of babies had British-born parents.

Across England and Wales, one in three babies had non-UK born parents, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Births: One in three babies born in the UK has at least one foreign parents, ONS figures show

The number of non-British people who come to the UK to have children has increased, as the proportion of babies with foreign-born mothers or fathers went from 21.2 per cent in 2000 to 31.4 per cent in 2012.

The number of foreign-born people in Britain has quadrupled over the past 60 years, with immigration being at the heart of almost half of all population growth.

David Cameron has announced that restrictions on EU migrants claiming benefits in the new year, which he said would make the UK a 'less attractive place for EU migrants'.

EU citizens who come to the UK will have to wait three months
 before they can claim out-of-work benefits, while those who fail an English test will also be denied some benefits.

But the restrictions are coming into place at the same time as restrictions are dropped on Romanians and Bulgarians taking certain jobs when they come to Britain.

Cap: David Cameron's proposals include a cap of 75,000 EU migrants and limiting access to benefits

Previously, temporary restrictions - which had been extended to their maximum period of seven years after Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel in the UK in 2007 - meant low-skilled workers were restricted by quotas, employers had to apply for work permits and migrants for an 'accession worker card'.

Once these restrictions expire, Bulgarians and Romanians should be entitled to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens.

The Home Office has proposed a 75,000 cap on EU migrants - although Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has slammed this as 'pointless', 'arbitrary' and 'distracting'.

Meanwhile, Labour's immigration policy has been blamed for allowing foreign workers an 'open door'.

Conservative MP Nigel Mills said: 'The rate
 of change over the past decade has been staggering. We have to be 
concerned.

'It is creating 
problems for community cohesion. It is also leading to rising tensions.

'There is justifiable concern about the impact this is having on young 
British people looking for jobs, and about benefit tourism.'

In 2012, 88,086 babies 
born in London - equivalent to 65.6 per cent - had either one or two 
parents born outside the UK.

There were 27,722 births where one parent 
was foreign-born, and 60,364 where both parents were born abroad.

In 
Newham, East London, 5,464 babies - 85 per cent - had one or more 
parents who were born abroad. In Brent, in West London, and Westminster,
 in central London, more than eight in 10 babies were foreign-born.

In only six of 32 London boroughs were fewer than 50 per cent of births to non-British parents.

Outside
 London, the highest percentages were in the West Midlands, where 28.5 
per cent of babies had at least one foreign parent, and the South East, 
where it was 27.9 per cent. In the East of England, it was 27.3 per cent.

The lowest levels of 
babies with foreign-born parents were in the North East, with 13.2 per 
cent, and Wales, where the figure was 13.8 per cent.

The ONS said 
that the number of people in England and Wales who were born abroad has 
risen from 1.9million, 4.3 per cent of the total population, to 
7.5million foreign people, equivalent to 13 per cent.

This was the first time that the ONS has released a detailed breakdown for both parents as opposed to just mothers - a significantly lower figure.

Figures
 from the most recent census, in 2011, showed the biggest migrant group 
was those born in India, which accounts for 694,000 people in England 
and Wales. Poland was in second place, with 579,000.

The figures from The Office for National Statistics show that the proportion of babies with foreign-born parents has risen from 21.2 per cent in 2000 to 31.4 per cent last year.
