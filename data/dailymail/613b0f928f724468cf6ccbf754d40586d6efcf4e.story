Three drunken brothers who pushed a celebrity bishop’s nephew into the path of a double-decker bus when he intervened to stop them bullying a man were each jailed for eight years today.

Alex, Ross and Nicholas Lovett repeatedly stamped on Andrew Cross’s head and body, knocking him unconscious as the vehicle trapped him and crushed his leg.

The 33-year-old victim’s uncle is Bishop Jonathan Blake, who blessed the marriage of the late Jade Goody to Jack Tweed and has appeared widely on television.

The holyman watched the Inner London Crown Court trial and sentencing with his martial artist nephew Mr Cross from the public gallery.

Mr Cross suffered a deep gash on his leg which was left unstitched for 48 hours, and a full-thickness rip through his lip which exposed his teeth.

His shin has been left deformed having swelled to ‘three times the size’ of the other and he has been unable to enjoy his sport at the same level.

The Lovetts had been out celebrating Ross’s birthday with their wives when they first set upon Mr Cross in the door of the packed Excel Cabs, in Bexleyheath, Kent, on March 6 last year.

The victims were waiting in line to go home after leaving a nightclub when they noticed Alex had an unknown man by the neck against a wall.

Mr Cross split them up and the clash subsided, but as he walked outside Alex headbutted and pushed him.

Ross, 32, a doorman who has a previous caution for headbutting a man in a pub, then started on Mr Cross' friend Martin Workman.

He headbutted him and attempted to gouge out his eye with his fingers.

Mr Cross landed punches on 38-year-old Alex’s face leaving him with a broken nose and eye socket.

Jurors watched chilling CCTV footage captured on the bus of Mr Cross trying to get away from his attackers and swinging his arms as he is surrounded and hit by the vehicle.

Mr Cross’s ‘roar’ could be heard over the road in the Golden Lion pub.

Fortunately the driver had seen the commotion and slowed down so he just managed to stop before he completely ran over Mr Cross.

The wheel instead crushed his leg and trapped him by his trousers.

Jonathan Turner, prosecuting, said: ‘He gets trapped under that bus and his jeans get caught up in the wheel.

‘He is covered in blood.’

The prosecutor said while he was unable to break free, the brothers were stamping on the victim’s head around 10 times and Nicholas, 40, bit him on his arm.

Mr Workman said in one strike, one of the brothers ‘penalty-kicked Andy’ in the back of his head causing his eyes to roll as he lost consciousness.

The friend managed to prevent a further ‘running kick’ connecting with Mr Cross’s skull, and laughing Ross then pinned Mr Workman against the bus.

Mr Workman, a fireman and also a 
Wing Chun martial arts instructor, suffered a fractured hand during the incident when he 
tried to stop blows landing on his friend’s skull.

Mr Cross was taken to nearby Queen Elizabeth Hospital for treatment with Mr Workman fearing he would die.

The deep wound swelled up so much it was
not stitched for 48 hours to relieve the pressure, and he also suffered
ligament damage in his other leg from trying to kick himself free.

The court heard Alex, a father-of-two and manager at an electrical company with no previous convictions, had been going through a ‘difficult divorce’ at the time.

He closed his eyes as he heard his fate and weeping could be heard coming from the public gallery.

Judge Patricia Lees said: ‘I do take the view that Mr Cross is lucky to be alive.

‘This could have resulted in serious brain injury, no thanks to the three in the dock, because it was plainly their intention to inflict really serious harm.

‘You don’t throw someone into the path of a bus without expecting that.

‘The three of them were standing in the doorway of the cab office intimidating people.

‘No-one was to get the better of them.

‘Anything done by Mr Cross was in response to a sustained and vicious assault.

‘Mr Cross decided, even though he had been headbutted, just to go, but he wasn’t allowed to do that.

‘The CCTV footage was chilling.

‘The attack involved persistence to a truly shocking degree.’

Judge Lees commended many of the witnesses for their efforts to help and she said the careful actions of some prevented Mr Workman from losing his leg.

Alex Lovett, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, who the judge said was the leader, admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and affray.

The two other brothers, both married fathers of three, Ross Lovett, Dartford, Kent, and Nicholas Lovett, of Greenhithe, Kent, who has no previous convictions, denied the same charges and were convicted following trial.

Ross was further convicted of assaulting Mr Workman occasioning him actual bodily harm.
