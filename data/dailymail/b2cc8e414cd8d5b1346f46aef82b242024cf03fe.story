Giant industrial robots are used to build cars and move heavy packages.

And now Chinese inventors have created a miniature desktop version that can pour drinks, fetch items and even play the xylophone, should you be in need of urgent music in the office.

The creators of the uArm tiny industrial desk robot envisage it could be installed on every office desk to make life easier in the future.

The uArm robot can be programmed to perform tasks using x,y and z coordinates as well as being operated by a mouse. Here, the machine unpacks the contents of a box

It is designed to help with minor manual tasks from moving business cards to pouring liquids and used together, the Shenzhen-based company uFactory says the robots could form a production line, much like their larger counterparts used in factories around the world.

The miniature machine has 4-degrees of freedom, which is created using three servo motors on the base to control the main movement of the arm and a mini servo on the top, to move and rotate an object.

It has enough strength to easily lift and move a full drinks can thanks to a small vacuum pump at the end of the suction cup on the arm.

When operated together, the machines can perform more complex task, such as transferring liquid from one cup to another

The movement of the robot follows the movement of a computer mouse and the wheel can be used to raise and lower the machine's arm

The uArm can be controlled with a mouse and a desktop computer using a Windows app. The company is also working on an iOS and Android app too so that the robot could be operated using smartphones with a Bluetooth connection.

The robot's arm mirrors the movement of a mouse so that when a user scrolls down using the wheel of a mouse, the arm of the robot is lowered. Operators can also programme in x, y and z coordinates so that the robot can perform specific actions without a person controlling the robot’s servo motors directly.

The design of the diminutive robot, which is made from either acrylic or wood, is inspired by the industrial robot arm IRB460.

uArm can be customised to suit the needs of its user. Here it is pre-programmed to move items around and shows off its dexterous grabbing action

uFactory’s Kickstarter page says: ‘Robots are awesome, and wouldn't it be nice if everybody who wants a robot arm can actually afford one? After all, $50,000 (£30,160) is kind of a lot of money. This is when we, the uFactory come in.’

A spokesman for the company said uArm will be able to be customised to suit the needs of its user.

‘You can add a LED to make a computer-controlled desk lamp or install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around. Or even play music on a xylophone,’ he said.

uFactory originally asked for $5,000 (£3,150) of investment on crowd funding site Kickstarter, but has pulled in over $71,000 (£42,825) so far, showing that its labour-saving robots are in demand.

The company hopes to begin shipping the robotic arms in May. uArm robots are currently available to order from Kickstarter – although some models have sold out.

A kit containing an acrylic arm with a gripper and sucker costs $229 (£138) and comes assembled for $279 (£168) plus shipping.

Mechanical kits without the motors and electric modules start from $69 (£42) and a custom model costs $1,000 (£603).

The robots are controlled by a mouse and can work together to perform more complex tasks. But as they cost $229 for an assembled kit, a factory-style production line doesn't come too cheap
