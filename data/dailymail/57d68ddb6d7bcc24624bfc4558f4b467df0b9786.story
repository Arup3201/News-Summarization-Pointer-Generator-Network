Poignant tributes were last night paid to the memory of missing April Jones as hundreds of well-wishers released pink balloons and Chinese lanterns into the night sky.

Local residents lit candles and released the symbolic glowing lights after the schoolgirl's parents asked for her to be remembered, one week on from her disappearance.

It is believed Coral Jones, 40, and husband Paul, 44, released their own Chinese lantern from their garden in Machynlleth in a private remembrance.

Blackpool Tower was lit up pink, several hours after the five-year-old's alleged killer was remanded by magistrates.

Bridger appeared  at Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court charged with abducting and murdering April as well as the unlawful disposal and concealment of her body with intent to pervert the
course of justice.

Wearing black trousers and a blue jumper Bridger, 46, stood in the dock as the charges were put to him.

Bridger, who had a closely shaved 
head and goatee beard, cried to himself as he spoke to confirm his name,
age and address. He also confirmed he understood the charges.

He appeared on the verge of tears throughout the hearing, which lasted around four minutes.

He was remanded in custody and will next appear at Caernarfon Crown Court on Wednesday.

Minutes earlier, about 100 people lined the streets, shouting abuse and heckling as Bridger's security van swept into a secure court car park.

Bridger arrived at the court in a white security van shortly after 10am, escorted by three police cars.

At
one point an object, believed 
to be a shoe or a bottle, was thrown at the van and police struggled to 
restrain angry members of the public stood behind a cordon.

April's godmother Mair Raftree 
was standing in the crowd and burst into tears as soon as the van passed 
her. Many others wore pink ribbons in support of April's family.

Family friend Dilwyn Jones, 67, said: 'I have come down here today because we want to know where April is. That is all the community want to know.'

In the dock: Mark Bridger cried to himself as he spoke to confirm his name, age and address. He also confirmed he understood the charges and was then remanded in custody after the four minute hearing

Memory: The balloons and lanters were released at 7.30pm last night to mark a week since April disappeared

Guest house worker Sophie Francis, 18, added: 'It's not been the same since April was taken. No one feels safe, no one takes any risks anymore, you don't see kids playing about as much as you use to. It's just shocked us all.'

Most of the angry crowd were locals but some had travelled more than a 100 miles to see Bridger.

Last night, Superintendent Ian John, the police officer leading the hunt for April, admitted his force would have to prepare themselves for never finding her.

The devastating blow for the Jones family came at the end of the sixth full day of searching for her.

Superintendent John said: 'We have to prepare for the time when we accept that we might never find April.

'But we are optimistic that the work we are doing is going to give us the best possible chance.'

He said there was no official cut off point for the search.

But as the increasingly pessimistic 
mood fell over those involved in the exhaustive search for April, more 
than 200 people - mainly young families with children - filled the green
at Bryn-y-gog at Machynlleth, West Wales, just as it was at 
7pm the week earlier before April vanished.

People brought their own lanterns and 
balloons after the message went out from parents Coral and Paul to 
remember 'angelic' little April.

One mother said: 'We just felt we had to be here to mark the week since April was last seen.

'We lit a candle but other people brought pink balloons to release.

'It is incredible to think that last Monday she was here happy and playing just like all the other children here.

'God only know what her poor parents and family have been through since.'

Suspect: Bridger was charged with the abduction and murder of April after four days of questioning

Security guard Spencer Shirley, 31, admitted throwing a bottle at the prison van containing Bridger as it arrived. Mr Shirley said he left his home in Birmingham at 5.30am for the three-hour train journey to Aberystwyth.

He said: 'This story has really moved me - I find it absolutely heartbreaking. I’ve got a nephew and nieces the same age of April and I can’t stand the idea of anything happening to them.'

Mr Shirley had to be restrained by police as he tried to break through the police cordon as the van left.

Bridger left court more than an hour after the hearing. The delay was due to a decision to serve him an early lunch before leaving.

That is because he is being taken to Manchester where he will be held on remand until his scheduled crown court appearance.

The police van was punched and kicked as it drove out of a covered area within the court precincts.

A Facebook group dedicated to April urged people not to give up searching for her.

April, who suffers from cerebral 
palsy and needs daily medication, was last seen near her home on the 
Bryn-y-Gog estate in Machynlleth on Monday evening.

Bridger was arrested the following 
day. He was charged with the abduction and murder of April on Saturday 
following four days of questioning.

April's parents allowed her to play out late as a treat after she 
received a glowing school report.

Magistrates' Court and at one point an object thought to be a shoe (circled) was 
thrown at the van as it pulled into the court car park

On
Wednesday, a clearly devastated Mrs Jones made an emotional plea for 
information over her daughter's disappearance, in which she said: 'It's 
been 36 hours since April was taken from us. There must be someone out 
there who knows where she is and can help the police find her.

'We are desperate for any news. April is only five years old. Please, please, help find her.'

April remains missing despite an intensive, ongoing search effort which has now spanned a week.

More than 700 people packed into Machynlleth's St Peter's Church yesterday to attend an emotional service for the schoolgirl.

Reverend
Kathleen Rogers led the moving sermon and said prayers for April's 
parents. She also paid tribute to the community who had pulled together 
to help in the search.

She read a touching poem on behalf of 
April's mother called 'Mum' as the Bishop of Bangor, Reverend Andy John,
said the tight-knit community had 'touched the heart of people around 
the world'.

Mountain rescue teams were stood down last night as the search operation switched emphasis.

Meanwhile
the hunt goes on, with investigating officers revealing police numbers 
on the ground were expected to double yesterday morning.

Night time search efforts have been 
suspended, with the shift in manpower being described as a change of 
'resources rather than intensity'.

Superintendent
Ian John paid tribute to mountain rescue volunteers 'who have worked 
themselves to a standstill in the search for April'.

He added: 'We are upping our numbers to 18 teams which will be over 100 officers.'

Welsh Secretary David Jones hailed the 'tremendous community spirit' of the people of Machynlleth.

Addressing the Conservative Party 
conference, he asked activists in Birmingham to 'spare a few thoughts 
today for April Jones, her family and the officers of Dyfed-Powys Police
and the search and rescue services'

He added: 'Most particularly, could I 
ask you to think about the people of Machynlleth who, over the last 
seven really harrowing days, have displayed such tremendous community 
spirit.'
