Before the Olympics began, Victoria Pendleton predicted confidently that London 2012 would become known as the 'girlie games'.

What incredible foresight the British track cyclist showed. Her prophecy has come true in spectacular fashion, with GB's girls delivering many of the historic moments for which these Games will be forever remembered.

From Jessica Ennis powering to gold in the heptathlon and Charlotte Dujardin's incredible elegance in the dressage, to the hurricane force of boxer Nicola Adams and the immense strength of character shown by our rowers, London 2012 has definitely been about our female athletes.

In fact, if GB's women were to compete
 independently of the men, they would be seventh in the medal table. Their
 ten gold medals would put them level with Germany's overall tally and 
ahead of France, Italy, Australia and Japan.

Team GB's women have five times as many golds as Spain and Brazil, and more than those two nations combined with Japan.

And this doesn't take into 
consideration two of Britain's equestrian golds - the team dressage 
winners were two-thirds female and the team eventing gold medallists 
four-fifths.

From orchestrating the beat-perfect 
movement of the horses in the dressage to executing brutal kicks to the 
head in taekwondo, Britain's women have delivered right across the spectrum of Olympic sports.

It
 was the brilliant row of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the 
women's pair that broke Britain's gold medal duck on the fifth day of 
the Games, prompting an avalanche of precious metal and glorious 
moments.

Jessica Ennis won the heptathlon in superb style on Saturday night

Victoria Pendleton took gold in the Keirin, just one of seven gold medallists won by Britain's track cyclists at these Games

And the woman tipped to succeed Pendleton, Laura Trott, won gold in the omnium event

Trott (centre) also collected a second gold with Dani King (left) and Joanna Rowsell in the team pursuit

Their success at Eton Dorney was 
followed up by two more rowing golds, including an emotional moment of 
fulfillment for Katherine Grainger, who won gold at last in the double 
sculls after three consecutive silver.

Female success then moved indoors, to
 the electric atmosphere of the Velodrome. 'Queen' Victoria Pendleton 
may have jumped the gun in the team sprint but she showed her familiar 
strength of character to return 24 hours later and blitz the field in 
the keirin. 

And Pendleton's heir apparent Laura 
Trott, just 20, exploded onto the biggest stage with twin golds in the 
omnium, the most arduous of cycling events, and the team pursuit 
alongside Dani King and Joanna Rowsell.

The golden dynasty of British track cycling appears to be set to continue for some time yet.

Perhaps the defining moment of British success at these Games arrived a few moments before 9pm on Saturday night, when Jessica Ennis, the poster girl of the British team, completed her heptathlon triumph before an adoring crowd in the Olympic Stadium.

The sight of British athletes parading around a venue, smiling broadly and with the Union Jack fluttering behind them, before wiping away the mandatory tear on the medal podium, has become a delightfully common one.

The glory has continued this week in three contrasting sports.

Charlotte Dujardin and Laura Bechtolsheimer won gold in the dressage, an event of grace and elegance, while Nicola Adams and Jade Jones did likewise in boxing and taekwondo, sports of unbridled power and brute force.

We have become so accustomed to 
hearing 'God Save the Queen' during these Games that it would be easy to
 forget the silver and bronze medals, but the female roll of honour goes
 on and on.

Rebecca Adlington has never finished 
out of the medals in an Olympic event, though she wouldn't perhaps of 
envisaged two bronze medals from her home Games.

Lizzie Armitstead won our first 
medal, a silver, in the women's road race - a few seconds of early drama
 as three cyclists sprinted down The Mall which truly set the tone for 
countless moments of Olympic theatre to come.

The judoka Gemma Gibbons took silver and devoted it to her late mum in a heart-wrenching moment.

And further female success in the rowing came when Katherine Grainger (left) and Anna Watkins won the double sculls

Their performances drew gushing 
praise from Lord Coe, who also pointed out that the London Olympics are 
the first ever in which both men and women have been included in every 
squad and participated in every sport.

He added that the 2012 Games had continued the progress for women's sport made in the last London Games in 1948.

'I think that having 1948 with Fanny Blankers-Koen here really moved that argument for the presence of women in the Games.

'We've had more women competing in these Games (and) some of the big high-profile moments.

'If you look at this morning's media they are focusing on women.'

He also praised the participation of 
Sarah Attar who became one of the first women to represent Saudi Arabia 
at the Olympics when she ran in the 800 metres.

Her appearance followed months of 
talks, with Saudi Olympic chiefs at one point insisting no women would 
be allowed to take part.

Lord Coe said she had 'really moved this agenda on in London'

International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said: 'If you take, for example, 1984, only 24% of athletes were women.

'This Games, our provisional figure 
is that this is just over 44%. So we are nearly at gender equality, 
which is really good going.'

But he added: 'Just getting all the 
NOCs (National Olympic Committees) to send athletes is great, symbolic 
and an important symbol, but that is not enough.

'We continue to push the NOCs and 
work with the NOCs to provide sporting facilities for women, which is 
challenging in some countries. So we will continue to work on that too.'

Grainger and Watkins were congratulated by Prime Minister David Cameron at the London Studios this morning

Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hoskins picked up more precious metal in the lightweight double sculls final

And all this, just eight months after a BBC Sports Personality shortlist that didn't contain a single woman.

There have been so many brilliant 
successes that some pundits have wildly speculated there should be 
separate awards for men and women.

This is ridiculous - at least half of this year's shortlist will be female.

But there is a prize far greater than
 this - a generation of girls inspired by this roster of Olympic role 
models to get involved in all manner of sports.

They want to run, jump and throw like Jess, pedal like Pendleton and even punch like Adams. Sports clubs the length and breadth of the country are already being overwhelmed with new recruits.

The Olympics has certainly captured the imagination -
 witness the record 80,203 crowd at Wembley Stadium last night for the 
women's football final - and the challenge now is to convert this 
feel-good factor into Britain's Olympians of the future.

Team GB is punching way above its weight in the Olympics, as shown by an interactive atlas which distorts the size of countries to reflect the number of medals won.

A researcher at the University of St Andrews has created a map which displays the distribution of medals at London 2012.

The online atlas continually updates to show how the medals are spread across the globe as well as the number of medals by population.

When countries are reconfigured by population size, Britain swells considerably.

This map, created by the University of St Andrews, shows the number of medals won in the Olympics so far for each country

The map shows how well nations are doing by their population size

The USA, predicted to win the most medals, appears smaller than usual and second-place favourites China shrinks to a fraction of its actual size because of its massive population.

India is doing poorly considering its population size, while Slovenia and New Zealand are leading countries.

The map is updated every hour and can be
