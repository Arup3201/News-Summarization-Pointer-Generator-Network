The National Security Agency has broken privacy rules or overstepped its legal authority thousands of times each year since Congress granted the agency broad new powers in 2008, The Washington Post reported Thursday.

Most of the infractions involve unauthorized surveillance of Americans or foreign intelligence targets in the United States, both of which are restricted by law and executive order.

They range from significant violations of law to typographical errors that resulted in unintended interception of U.S. emails and telephone calls, the Post said, citing an internal audit and other top-secret documents provided it earlier this summer from NSA leaker Edward Snowden, a former systems analyst with the agency.

In one of the documents, agency 
personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic 
language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence.

The Post cited a 2008 example of the interception of a 'large number' of calls placed from Washington when a programming error confused U.S. area code 202 for 20, the international dialing code for Egypt, according to a 'quality assurance' review that was not distributed to the NSA's oversight staff.

In what the Post said appeared to be one of the most serious violations, the NSA diverted large volumes of international data passing through fiber-optic cables in the United States into a repository where the material could be stored temporarily for processing and selection.

The operation collected and commingled U.S. and foreign emails, the Post said, citing a top-secret internal NSA newsletter. NSA lawyers told the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the agency could not practicably filter out the communications of Americans.

In October 2011, months after the program got underway, the court ruled that the collection effort was unconstitutional.

The New York Times reported that 1,904 of the incidents appeared to be 'roamers' - foreign nationals whose cell phones were being wiretapped without warrants who then came to the U.S.

According to the audit, a sharp increase in such incidents in a single quarter could have resulted from Chinese citizens traveling to the U.S. to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year with family. 

'We're a human-run agency operating in a complex environment with a number of different regulatory regimes, so at times we find ourselves on the wrong side of the line,' a senior NSA official said in an interview, speaking to the newspaper with White House permission on the condition of anonymity.

He added, 'You can look at it as a percentage of our total activity that occurs each day. You look at a number in absolute terms that looks big, and when you look at it in relative terms, it looks a little different.'

The NSA audit obtained by the Post dated May 2012, counted 2,776 incidents in the preceding 12 months of unauthorized collection, storage, access to or distribution of legally protected communications. Most were unintended. Many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure.

The most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 Americans and green-card holders.

The documents included a level of detail and analysis that is not routinely shared with Congress or the special court that oversees surveillance, the paper said. In one of the documents, agency personnel are instructed to remove details and substitute more generic language in reports to the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

In an emailed statement to The Associated Press late Thursday, John DeLong, NSA's director of compliance, said, 'We want people to report if they have made a mistake or even if they believe that an NSA activity is not consistent with the rules.

'NSA, like other regulated organizations, also has a "hotline" for people to report - and no adverse action or reprisal can be taken for the simple act of reporting.

'We take each report seriously, investigate the matter, address the issue, constantly look for trends and address them as well - all as a part of NSA's internal oversight and compliance efforts. What's more, we keep our overseers informed through both immediate reporting and periodic reporting.'

Director of National Intelligence James Clapper claimed during a Senate hearing that the NSA doesn't collect information on innocent Americans

President Barack Obama recently pledged to provide more transparency and oversight in the NSA surveillance programs.

The issue has divided the U.S. Congress, with some representatives  among them New York Republican Peter King, insisting that data collection is critical to national security, while others criticizing the intelligence agency for going to far in their efforts.

Some members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have been trying for some time to get the NSA to give some kind of accounting of how much data it collects "incidentally" on Americans through various electronic dragnets.

The Obama administration has strongly resisted such disclosures.
