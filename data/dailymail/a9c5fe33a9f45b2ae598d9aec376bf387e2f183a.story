It's not rare for angry hotel guests to create a scene during their stay.

But what is less common is when the aggravated customer - is a badger.

The stressed-out animal caused a luxury Swedish hotel to lock down on Friday morning after it started running around inside. 

Angry: The badger is seen outside the entrance to the Radisson Blu hotel in Stockholm

Bizarre: The stand-off with hotel staff lasted 40 minutes and meant guests could not enter or leave

Officials said the 'ill-tempered' badger somehow got in to the Radisson Blu in Stockholm, and prevented guests and employees from going in or out for 40 minutes.

The city's police were quickly alerted and prepared to deal with the standoff. 

They also called in a game warden to help deal with the situation, but the badger fled the scene before they arrived.  

A statement from the Swedish capital's police website read: 'A crazy or stressed-out badger is preventing the staff and clients at a major hotel from leaving their cars and from picking up their bags.'

The Swedish newspaper DN stated the badger may have been angry after waking up early from hibernation.

Staff told the publication that they called police as a last resort because it was 'impossible' to chase the creature away.  

It is also suggested that the animal could have been looking for some food.
