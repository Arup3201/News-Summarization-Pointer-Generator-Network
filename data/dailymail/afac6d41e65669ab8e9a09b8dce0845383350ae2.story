It may sound like a sci-fi weapon, but two scientists have created a real 'death ray'.

The ‘weapon’ is built from the sort of materials found in people’s garages and harnesses the sun’s rays to melt zinc and aluminium.

The main component of the 'death ray' is a Fresnel lens - which is ridged on one side to focus light into a small area - and used to be fitted in TV sets.

The DIY death ray was made by Kevin Moore and Grant Reynolds of the Science Channel.

They were inspired to harness light to burn metal after thinking about children using small magnifying glasses to melt plastic figures, for example.

They built a basic frame from wood and positioned the lens - which can capture a greater degree of light thanks to its ridged surface - to focus the sun’s ray to a small point.

The device can pivot up and down and from side to side, so it can be pointed towards the sun.

‘That way we can focus the maximum amount of photons into a small spot,’ the designers said in a video. 

The device has been used to liquefy a pile of zinc disks (pictured), meaning that the beam was hotter than 450°C (842°F).  It was made by Kevin Moore and Grant Reynolds of the Science Channel

They then placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens. The beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside (pictured), which began to pop

A Fresnel lens is flat on one side and ridged on the other, usually in concentric circles.

Each ring is slightly thinner than the next so it focuses the light towards the centre, concentrating it.

Each ridge bends the light slightly more than the one beneath it, so the light rays all emerge in a beam.

They were first used in the 1800s as the lens that focuses the beam in lighthouse lamps.

Plastic versions are used as magnifiers and are often made of thin plastic and huge glass versions are used as solar concentrators.

Their aim was to create a ray of light that is 850°C (1,500°F).

Moore and Reynolds noted the beam was ‘insanely hot’ by accidently burning themselves.

They then managed to liquefy a pile of zinc disks, meaning that the beam was hotter than 450°C (842°F).

Next, they placed an aluminium packet of popcorn beneath the lens.

The beam quickly burned a hole though the packaging to reveal the popcorn inside, which began to pop.

This means that the focal point was hotter than 660°C (1,220°F) - the melting point of aluminium.

However, when the duo put a square of silicon bronze under the ray, which is used to make nuts and bolts, it smoked but didn’t melt, meaning the beam was not as hot as intended. 

The pair is not the first to build a death ray. In 2011, a teenager from Indiana, covered an ordinary fibreglass satellite dish with 5,800 tiny mirror tiles to make his own 'weapon' (pictured)

The pair is not the first to build a death ray. 

In 2011, a teenager from Indiana covered an ordinary fibreglass satellite dish with 5,800 tiny mirror tiles and made his very own 'death ray'.

Eric Jacqmain claimed that when aligned correctly it generated a heat spot a couple of centimetres across, with an 'intensity of 5,000 shining suns'.

His ray device, which stands at 5ft 9ins (1.7metres) and measures just 42 inches (107cm) across, generates enough power to melt steel, vaporise aluminium, boil concrete, turn dirt into lava, and obliterate any organic material in an instant.
