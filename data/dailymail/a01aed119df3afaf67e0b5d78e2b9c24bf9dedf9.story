A substitute teacher and five students at a suburban Cleveland high school have been charged after police say a 14-year-old developmentally disabled boy was bullied in gym class.

Police say the boy was knocked down by a volleyball thrown at his head last month at Parma Senior High School.

One student then allegedly kicked the victim and another dragged him around by his feet.

Scene: The incident occurred inside the Parma High School gym (pictured, but the students involved are not shown) during class and the teacher knew it was happening

Police say 49-year-old substitute teacher Gregg Mellinger continued class in another part of the gym as the victim remained on the floor.

Mellinger, of North Ridgeville, was charged last week with child endangerment. He didn't immediately return a phone call Monday.

Three students face juvenile charges of assault and two students are charged with disorderly conduct.

Authorities say the boy wasn't seriously injured.

School officials called the conduct unacceptable.

'This is something that we've been taking seriously for a very long time,' superintendent Jeff Graham told The Cleveland Plain Dealer.

He released a statement stressing the action that was taken as soon as school officials were notified, making clear that the substitute teacher was not a full time employee and was hired through an outside agency.Â 

Unacceptable: The teacher now faces criminal charges, three students face juvenile charges of assault and two students are charged with disorderly conduct

'Upon learning of the incident, school officials immediately notified the Parma Police Department and fully cooperated with their investigation,' Graham wrote in the statement.

'In addition to any potential legal consequences from the Police Department, the District is conducting its own school investigation and will take any necessary steps consistent with district policy.'

The staffing agency who hired Mellinger was identified as The Renhill Group, and they have already spoken out against his actions.

'We're deeply troubled by the allegations; the safety of the students of Ohio is our top priority,' the company's risk manager, Tami Stansley, said.
