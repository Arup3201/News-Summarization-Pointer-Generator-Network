Not whipped: David Cameron denied that his thoughts on Syria were influenced by his wife

David Cameron denied yesterday that his wife has influenced his policy towards intervention in Syria, as he gave his gloomiest assessment yet of efforts to end the conflict.

Government figures said last week that Samantha Cameron – who visited a refugee camp in the region earlier this year – was pushing the Prime Minister to take further action there.

Mr Cameron said his wife had been ‘very moved’ by her visit to Lebanon in March, where half a million Syrians have fled.

But he insisted it was a ‘total urban myth’ that UK policy was affected by her experiences there on a humanitarian mission with the Save The Children charity.

During her visit, Samantha Cameron met a ten-year-old girl whose mother was killed when a shell destroyed the family home, and a mother of six whose son was shot by a sniper.

She said at the time: ‘No child should experience what they have.

‘With every day that passes, more children and parents are being killed, more innocent childhoods are smashed to pieces.’

The Prime Minister said Syria, which plunged into civil war more than two years ago, was ‘on a depressing trajectory’ and President Bashar Al Assad is ‘stronger than he was a few months ago’.

Efforts to oust the ‘evil’ Syrian dictator appear to have reached a stalemate, he told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

Britain has sent help to the Free Syrian Army, including communications equipment, but has not taken a decision on sending weapons amid growing fears over some of the rebels’ Al Qaeda links.

Mr Cameron said it was right to continue to support the opposition. ‘You do have problems with part of the opposition which is extreme, that we should have nothing to do with,’ he said.

‘But that is not a reason for pulling up the drawbridge, putting our head in the sand and doing nothing’.

The Prime Minister said his wife was ‘very moved by what she saw because you hear from people – and I’ve done this – you hear from people who are fleeing an appalling regime that is murdering their husbands, wives, children, wrecking their communities.’

But Mr Cameron said: ‘She does not influence my policy on this. I’ve been very passionate about this for a long time.’
