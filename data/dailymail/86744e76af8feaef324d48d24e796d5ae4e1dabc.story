Texas has launched a fleet of armed-to-the-teeth gunboats tasked with hunting down the Mexican drug runners that strike fear on the waterways along the US border.

Almost every day gangs of sea-hardened smugglers attempt to cross the Rio Grande river in boats laden with guns, drugs or people.

Their business has become so lucrative that the pirates will stop at nothing to get their precious cargos into America, and have developed a reputation for extreme violence towards anyone who stands in their way.

Patrols: The Texas Department of Public Safety said the 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island

'The people we go up against, the drug cartels, 
they have unlimited money and unlimited fire power,' Major Bob 
Bailey, Texas Highway Patrol Special Operations, told Fox News.

The new gunboats are similar to the Navy swift boats that plied the rivers of Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

They are equipped with night vision technology, ballistic shielding and an arsenal of heavy machine guns capable of firing up to 900 rounds a minute.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said the 
34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the
Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre 
Island.

About 50,000 people have been killed in raging
drug violence in Mexico in the past five years.

Armed to the teeth: The gunboats are equipped with night vision technology, ballistic shielding and an arsenal of heavy machine guns capable of firing up to 900 rounds a minute

Just last week a gruesome video depicting the 
decapitation of five members of a Mexican drug cartel by a rival gang was posted on the internet in the latest atrocity in the raging battle over drug-smuggling routes.

In January, one gang, known as Los Zetas, released a video 
showing the hanging of two members of the gulf cartel and last month 49 
decapitated bodies were dumped along a highway by the same gang.

Look out: The 34-foot shallow water crafts would be deployed on the Rio Grande and the Intercoastal Waterway, which separates the Texas mainland from Padre Island

The Zetas, one of Mexico's most feared cartels, were founded by former 
soldiers who defected from the Mexican military in 1998 to work as hired
killers for drug traffickers.

They have since carved out their own 
smuggling empire, expanded massively across Mexico and diversified into 
kidnapping, extortion and theft of crude oil.

On June 10, the dismembered bodies of 11 men and three women were discovered in the sugar-cane 
farming town of Ciudad Mante in the south of Tamaulipas state, which 
borders on Texas.

Tamaulipas has been one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in Mexico's drug war.

In it for the money: Their business has become so lucrative in recent years that the pirates will stop at nothing to get their precious cargos into America, with a reputation to shoot on sight whoever stands in their way

Just five days earlier, Mexican police found seven dismembered bodies in Pacific coast state Sinaloa, along with a message accusing authorities of cooperating with drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman - the country's most-wanted man.

Fears are growing in the US that Mexico's newly elected government could start negotiating with the country's brutal drug lords in a bid to buy peace.

Enrique
Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory in the country's 
presidential election on Sunday after exit polls showed him winning by a
comfortable margin.

Republican Jim Sensenbrenner told a 
congressional hearing that he feared the history of Enrique
Pena Nieto's new ruling party 
had a history of 'turning a blind eye to the cartels'.

He
said: ‘While in power, the PRI minimized violence by turning a blind 
eye to the cartels,’ adding that Pena Nieto ‘does not emphasize stopping
drug shipments or capturing kingpins’.
