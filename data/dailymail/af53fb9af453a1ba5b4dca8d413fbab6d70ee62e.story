Competition for places at Arsenal will be fierce this season and it seems Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has already laid down the gauntlet to Jack Wilshere. 

Oxlade-Chamberlain took to Twitter to post a picture of himself wearing his team-mates No 10 shirt with the message: 'Might have to rob this number off Wilsh soon.... @JackWilshere tell me suttin....'

Oxlade-Chamberlain currently wears the No 15 shirt for Arsenal. Wilshere is yet to respond to his team-mates lighthearted post.

The two England stars will see increased competition at the Emirates this season, however, after the arrival of Alexis Sanchez and the very real possibility that Arsene Wenger may sign another midfielder.

Arsenal have been linked with moves for Real Madrid's Sami Khederia and Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin.

Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain will be hoping to impress when Arsenal take on New York Red Bulls on Saturday.
