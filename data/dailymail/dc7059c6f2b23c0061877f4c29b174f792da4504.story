They are used to diagnose a host of conditions from food poisoning to bowel cancer.

But for many people, taking a stool sample is one of their worst nightmares. 

Now, in a bid to encourage more people to undertake them, a team of experts has prepared a step-by-step guide.

The idea behind the information - distributed by Public Health England - is to avoid those embarrassing 'how to' questions.

Public Health England has released a guide on how to prepare samples to test for a range of diseases

'Poo is a very important material for doctors as it can be used to test for a wide range of diseases and conditions - including salmonella, E.coli, campylobacter, and bowel cancer, to name a few,' explained Dr Cliodna McNulty, head of the Primary Care Unit at Public Health England.

'Thousands of people every year will be asked by their GP or other healthcare professional to give a sample for testing. 

'However a lot of people find the idea of this unpleasant, and have questions such as how to fill the pot, as it's so small.'  

The team has now produced a leaflet which which shows how the procedure can be done easily and with minimum unpleasantness.

Dr McNulty added: 'Although most people think of poo as being disgusting, it does have its uses and is the main way that doctors can test for gastro-intestinal infections and other bowel conditions like cancer. 

'Lack of a sample can hinder diagnosis and so we need to encourage people to submit samples when they are asked to do so.'

Stools contain bacteria and other substances that are present in the digestive system. By testing the levels of these substances and bacteria, healthcare professionals can work out what’s happening inside a person and diagnose or rule out a host of conditions.

For example, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme offers screening every two years to all men and women aged 60 to 69.

People in this age group are sent an invitation followed by a screening kit, so they can do the test at home. 

It involves wiping a small stool sample onto the testing card, which is then sealed and sent in the post to a lab for testing.

The test detects tiny amounts of blood, which people cannot normally see, as polyps and bowel cancers sometimes bleed.

Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in both men and women, with around 40,000 people diagnosed with the disease each year.

Research shows those who performed the test at home and went to subsequent appointments were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage than those diagnosed from their symptoms.

When bowel cancer is found at the earliest stage, there is an excellent chance of survival, with more than 90 per cent of people surviving the disease at least five years.

However the uptake is worryingly low, particularly among men - most likely due to embarrassment. 

Dr McNulty said: 'We realise most people find collecting poo an unpleasant thing to do. 

'However there are ways that doctors can help patients to feel confident to fill the pot in the easiest way possible.

'Without guidance some people did actually think they had to just go directly into the pot which adds to their distress.

'We want to encourage healthcare staff to take time to explain the importance of the sample in the patient’s treatment and to give our leaflet to help the collection process. 

'Together these will help to increase the numbers of samples sent for testing, which will help the patient’s care.'

The stool sample should be collected in a clean, dry screw-top container. Your doctor or the hospital will provide you with a plastic (specimen) container to use, although you can use any clean container as long as you can seal it.

Try not to collect urine or water (from the toilet) with the stool sample but don’t worry if you do. If you need to urinate, do this first, and then collect the stool sample.

To collect a stool sample:

• Label the container with your name, date of birth and the date

• Place something in the toilet to catch the stool, such as a potty or an empty plastic food container, or spread clean newspaper or plastic wrap over the rim of the toilet

• Make sure the sample doesn’t touch the inside of the toilet

• Use the spoon or spatula that comes with the container to place the sample in a clean screw-top container and screw the lid shut

• If you’ve been given a container, aim to fill around a third of it (that’s about the size of a walnut if you’re using your own container)

• Put anything you used to collect the sample in a plastic bag, tie it up and put it the bin

• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm running water
