Allan Staughton put his then girlfriend's cat into a tumble dryer

A man who put his cat in a tumble drier and posted the footage on YouTube has been jailed.

Allan Staughton, 23, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a cat at an earlier hearing.

Today he was jailed for 56 days by Huntingdon magistrates, the RSPCA said.

He was also banned from keeping animals for life.

Staughton told RSPCA inspectors that he thought the incident was funny when first questioned about it.

Vet Helen Dennis told magistrates that the cat, named Princess, would have been severely traumatised by the ordeal and it would have been akin to a form of torture for her.

Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the incident at Staughtonâ€™s home, the charity said.

Magistrates saw film of the cat being put into the machine as Staughton said it was going for 'a tumble'.

The machine was turned on with the cat spinning inside for 12 seconds before Staughton opened the door.

The cat was on its back in the bottom of the machine. Staughton then spun it twice more.

The court heard that Staughton suffers from attention deficit disorder.

The cat had belonged to Staughton's partner of four-and-a-half years. The relationship broke down over the incident.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'We have now found a loving new home for Princess.'

Staughton laughed as the cat, called Princess, was shoved in the tumble dryer and injured in the terrifying ordeal

Staughton trapped his girlfriend's terrified cat in the tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles, because he thought it was funny

The RSPCA were alerted to the online 
video entitled 'You must see this - it will crack you up' and launched a
man hunt for Staughton, who posted the sickening film under the alias 
Nitroazza - even asking viewers to rate it.

The lout broke down in tears during a previous magistrates' court hearing, last month, after his internet anonymity was unmasked.

During that hearing, Robert Starr, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told the court: 'The cat would have been very 
terrified and would have suffered mental and physical effects caused by 
the cat having no method of escape.

Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the ordeal and has now been rehomed

Sick Staughton admitted animal cruelty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court

'The
reason why Princess didn't move when the door was opened is because the
incident would have left the cat in sheer terror, unbalanced and 
disorientated.

'It left the cat without any of its senses that you would attribute to a cat.

'This would have been compounded by the fact that it had no means of escape.'

Mr Starr said a vet examined the cat on July 6 and said it would have been disoriented and traumatised by its experience.

The prosecutor added that when Staughton was interviewed he had thought the incident was 'funny'.

He added: 'He accepted it was a disgusting thing to do.'

The RSPCA tracked down Staughton outside a pub in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, following the incident on June 14.

After the incident Staughton's relationship broke down with the mother of his child and the owner of Princess

Princess was taken to Wood Green Animal Shelter, in Godmanchester, where she was later re-homed.

Staughton, admitted causing unnecessary suffering 
to the cat.

Kevin Warboys, mitigating, told the previous court hearing: 'Mr Staughton suffers from conduct disorder which he says means "I just do things without thinking".

'The
idea arose from the cat often getting into the tumble dryer after it 
has been used, which my client believes is because it is warm.

'This case has had a devastating effect on him and he awaits with trepidation the sentencing of the court.'
