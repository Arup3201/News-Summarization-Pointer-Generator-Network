The pregnant stepmother of a five-year-old boy who was found severely malnourished and covered in bruises claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently.  

Mother-of-six Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, and her husband Bradley, 24, were charged with felony child endangerment this weekend after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs.

Tammie claims that she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer. Her ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, but took his five-year-old son to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed for divorce on Tuesday from her husband of two years.

Tammie Bleimeyer told KHOU on Tuesday: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.'

However she doesn't necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition.

The 33-year-old added: 'I don’t know what caused him to 
look like that. I don’t know if it’s a health issue or something else 
like that. I don’t want to be like everyone else and assume 
the worse.'

Police discovered a locked closet with
 a mattress at the Bleimeyer home after being called following a disturbance last 
Thursday between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old stepson.

The
 teenager told police he had found his five-year-old stepbrother in a diaper under the stairs.

The stepmother denied that the boy was kept under the stairs but had a room and slept in a bunk bed. However she admitted that the child could have fitted under the stairs.

She also said that her 16-year-old son was lying because he did not respect his stepfather Bradley, who is only eight years older than him.

The child's stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer had reportedly fled the home with the boy before officers arrived, according to click2houston.

Bleimeyer,
 who is six months' pregnant, refused to return to the home when 
contacted by police.

She was tracked to a motel in Humble by her 
cellphone where she was found with the boy.

The pregnant 33-year-old told KHOU that she did not flee 
with the child but had simply gone to get pizza and that her husband was
 staying at the motel.

The child was taken to Texas Children's Hospital for treatment.

His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder.

His biological mother is now seeking custody of the boy. The woman, who has not been named publicly, has reportedly not seen her son for more than two years.

Her lawyer said that her ex, Bradley Bleimeyer, repeatedly took their son out of the state which made it hard for her to find him.

Tammie Bleimeyer was charged with endangering a child and released on $2,000 bond.

Bradley
 Bleimeyer, who was already out on bond for a burglary charge, was also 
charged with endangering a child.

The 24-year-old, who has spent time in
 jail and has string of prior convictions, is being held without bond.

Bradley Bleimeyer is the biological father of the five-year-old. His expectant wife is the biological mother of six children including the 16-year-old boy.

All the children are being cared for by other family members. The health of the other children is currently unknown.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Harris County Precinct 4 officers.

A hearing is yet to be scheduled for the Bleimeyers.
