Two children are dying needlessly or sustaining life-changing injuries from meningitis due to a delay in the vaccine being rolled out

At least 180 babies and children have been killed or left seriously damaged by meningitis B since the Government agreed in principle to provide them with jabs.

It emerged today that negotiations with the company providing the new vaccine have not yet started – 13 weeks after the deputy chief 
medical officer announced that children at risk would get protection.

Bexsero is the first vaccine to offer protection against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis in the UK.

Thousands of campaigners petitioned the Prime Minister and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging them to ensure the vaccine was approved on the NHS.

A U-turn by medical advisers to the Government in March led to routine vaccination being approved for infants and a one-off catch up programme for babies aged three and four months.

But Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant that makes Bexsero, says it has not had a single meeting with the Department of Health to decide the price.

UK charities say every day that passes means two children are dying needlessly or have life-changing injuries left by the disease.

The UK has one of the highest Meningitis B incidence rates in 
the world - affecting an average of 1,870 people each year - and the 
disease can kill in hours.

It kills more children under five than
 any other infectious disease in the UK, around 10 per cent, and experts
 calculate a further third are left with disabilities.

Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said at the time of the vaccine being approved: ‘We will now be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible.’

Campaigners hoped the decision meant babies could be getting jabs as early as the summer.

Dr Andrin Oswald, head of the vaccine division at Novartis, said the company had increased production to meet the expected demands of the new programme.

But if it does not start by the end of 2014, it will have to throw away more than a million doses of vaccine that could have been given to British babies and children.

He has personally offered to meet Jeremy Hunt to ensure any possible obstacles are ironed out, but has never met him.

Support: In January, 118 leading doctors wrote a letter urging Mr Hunt to give the jab the green light

He said ‘It is very frustrating and very sad because children keep on dying when we could do something about it.

‘When the vaccine was licensed 18 months 
ago we wanted to make sure nothing on our side would hold up 
negotiations on the price of the product.

‘We understand there needs to be a proper price that the minister can support but discussions have not started.’

Meningitis is a disease that terrifies parents and health professionals alike.

With symptoms that can appear flu-like, it can turn overnight into a life-threatening condition.

If meningitis-related blood infection takes hold, often the only way to save a child’s life is to amputate a limb. Hundreds of children are left disabled every year.

Some forms of the disease have been wiped out by vaccination, but meningitis B, the most common form, has remained a killer.

The new vaccine is estimated to cover 88 per cent of cases in the UK. Over the past decade there have been more than 10,000 cases recorded in England and Wales, with 500 deaths.

Meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia remain the leading infectious cause of death for children under the age of five.

Children who survive face neurological damage, limb amputation and severe skin damage.

Andy Hopkinson, of the charity Meningitis Now, said: ‘We have had no further information about the timetable for introducing this vaccine, since the positive decision was announced at the end of March this year.

‘Previous new vaccine introductions have had really clear leadership within the Department of Health, with a Director of Immunisations.

‘With this position no longer existing and following all the changes in the Department of Health and NHS, we are concerned this will lead to delays.

‘Our latest figures suggest that around 800 Meningitis B cases in the UK could have been prevented since the vaccine was licensed for use in January 2013. Every day brings more cases and more misery.’

Dr Oswald said production of the vaccine had been stepped up to meet the needs of British children, but the expiry dates were fast approaching.

‘If the programme does not start by the end of 2014, we will have to throw away more than a million doses that could have protected them’ he added.

A Department of Health spokesperson said:‘We want to agree a price as soon as possible so children can benefit from the vaccine, but we need to make sure NHS funds are used effectively and it is right we follow due process to make sure this happens.

‘Senior figures from the department, including the deputy chief medical officer, have already met with Novartis.

'We will be entering formal negotiations shortly so plans for the immunisation programme can be finalised.’
