As the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, Blenheim Palace has a special place in British history.

So it is with some astonishment that traditionalist visitors to the Oxfordshire stately home have found its grand apartments filled with modern art by Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei – including a giant pair of wooden handcuffs.

And they are not happy, filling the visitors’ book in the chapel with angry complaints, accusing the exhibition of ‘defacing’ the Churchills’ ancestral home.

'Out of place': A piece called He Xie 2012, which is made up of dozens of porcelain crabs that cover the floor of the elegant Red Drawing Room, above, is part of Ai Weiwei's exhibition at Blenheim Palace

Defaced: In the Great Hall is a 5,000-year-old Han Dynasty vase which Ai has painted with a Coca-Cola logo

Heritage: Visitors to Blenheim Palace, above, have heavily criticised the modern art show in the apartments

Ai is perhaps most famous in this country for letting art lovers explore some 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds in the Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in 2010 – a display which fell foul of health and safety legislation when the exhibit was found to create hazardous dust.

Now it is his controversial photos in Blenheim’s Long Library, once Sir Winston’s favourite room, that are causing tension.

Entitled Study of Perspective Series, they show the artist flicking his middle finger at significant buildings and locations including the White House and Tiananmen Square.

The works are hung in front of 10,000 volumes of leather-bound books, collected by the 9th Duke, alongside portraits of Queen Anne, King William III and the 1st Duke of Marlborough.

Also part of the exhibit is a piece called He Xie 2012, which is made up of dozens of porcelain crabs that cover the floor of the elegant Red Drawing Room.

On the west side of the Great Hall is a 5,000-year-old Han Dynasty vase which Ai has painted with a Coca-Cola logo, and in the Salon is a Circle of Animals, made out of bronze with gold plating.

Birthplace: The future PM, at the age of five

One of the most controversial objects in the exhibition is a pair of wooden handcuffs, created by the artist in 2012. 

They have been placed on the bed in the room where Lady Randolph Churchill gave birth to the former Prime Minister in 1874.

The 13cm by 40cm handcuffs take pride of place in the bedroom, which also contains a lock of Sir Winston’s baby curls and an Ai portrait called a Hanging Man In Porcelain, made out of a coat hanger over the bed.

However, visitors remained unimpressed. ‘The final photographs were disgusting and a terrible end to a wonderful tour!’ wrote one, while another added: ‘Beautiful house ruined by the vulgar art exhibition.’

‘The photographs in the library are disrespectful and completely out of place here,’ a third said.

‘Loved the Palace,’ said another. ‘All I would expect from British Heritage. There is, however, no room at all for the irreverent Art.’

Ai – who was imprisoned in China in 2011 for 81 days and is currently forbidden to leave the country – was instrumental in choosing where the 50 exhibits were displayed after viewing the inside of the apartments on video.

It is not uncommon for his works to sell for as much as £50,000, while the sunflower seeds made £486,000 when the work was sold at Sotheby’s.

Last night John Hoy, chief executive at Blenheim Palace, remained unperturbed by the controversy.

‘As anticipated and, as is often the case with contemporary art, it is not really suited to everyone’s taste,’ he said.
