Revolution? Customers can find out about their ancestry by spitting into a tube and paying £125

A test to tell if you are at risk from Alzheimer’s disease and dozens of other conditions goes on sale in Britain today costing £125.

The test uses a saliva sample to provide more than 100 pieces of genetic information including whether users are more likely than normal to suffer Parkinson’s, some cancers or baldness.

It can also predict whether they like coffee or hate Brussels sprouts, which type of exercise is likely to suit them best and give information about a person’s ancestry.

The test, already available in the US, is being marketed online by 23andMe, a firm part-funded by Google. A customer spits into a tube, seals it and sends it back to 23andMe’s labs for analysis. Four to six weeks later, they receive a detailed report in the post written in everyday language.

It will tell them, for instance, whether their risk of Alzheimer’s disease is higher or lower than average. 23andMe – run by Anne Wojcicki, wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin – says its ‘mission is to ensure that individuals can personally access, understand and benefit from the human genome’.

It says that armed with the information, people can take better care of their health. For instance, the print-out may give someone the impetus they need to give up smoking or it could mean they undergo regular health checks so that an illness can be caught – and treated early.

Genetic tests are already available in Britain but generally provide less information and are more expensive.

However, critics say the science behind such analysis is not is not advanced enough to provide worthwhile results.

This could lead to some people being falsely reassured, others worrying unnecessarily or facing higher insurance premiums and the NHS being put under added pressure.

Genome: Tests on DNA are also available in Britain, but provide less information and are more expensive

The firm has been banned from providing some information from the tests to customers in the US over fears it would lead to people seeking out treatment they do not need.

The US health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, was particularly concerned about information provided on one gene, BRCA, that raises the odds of breast and ovarian cancer.

It said: ‘For instance, if the BRCA-related risk assessment for breast or ovarian cancer reports a false positive, it could lead a patient to undergo prophylactic surgery, chemoprevention, intensive screening, or other morbidity-inducing actions, while a false negative could result in a failure to recognise an actual risk that may exist.’

There are also concerns that someone told they have a higher risk of an incurable condition such as Alzheimer’s may take a fatalistic approach and stop looking after their health.

Mark Thomas of UCL said: ‘For better or worse, genetic testing companies are here to stay'

Professor Sally Hodgson, an expert in cancer genetics from St George’s Hospital in South London, said DNA analysis is ‘very open to misunderstanding’.

She warned that the results could cause ‘undue and inappropriate anxiety’ and said that valuable NHS time could be taken up by people requesting further tests.

Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at University College London, said: ‘For better or worse, direct-to-the-consumer genetic testing companies are here to stay.

'One could argue the rights and wrongs of such companies existing, but I suspect that ship has sailed. 23andMe have enormous resources and leading scientists on their advisory board.

‘Nonetheless, it is important that independent scientists and government bodies remain vigilant to ensure that such companies produce scientifically accurate, responsibly formatted and non-alarmist reports to their customers.’

23andMe already has some British users and says most find the information ‘extremely valuable’.

Only 4 per cent have made an appointment with their doctor based on the results or asked for further tests.

The firm says it has spoken to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to ensure its test complies with UK regulations.
