Manchester United were given an early Christmas present as Daley Blind announced he was back training in football boots.

The Dutch star further eased United's recent injury woes as he told fans he was putting the studs back on to resume outside sessions.

Before injuring his knee in Holland's 6-0 win over Latvia last month, the midfielder had started eight games after signing from Ajax in September.
