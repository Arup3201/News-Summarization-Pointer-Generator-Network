A live political debate on Jordanian television erupted into chaos after one of the guests threw a bottle of water over his rival before trying to attack him with a chair ... two months after he attacked another opponent on a different show.

The programme, on satellite channel JoSat, pitted outspoken journalist Shaker al-Johari against lawyer and pro-Syrian regime activist, Samih Khrais, on the subject of the Syrian civil war on Friday night.

But as they sat down to discuss a recent speech by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad's al-Johari flew into a rage at being told he would have to sit on a panel with Khrais.

Foes: Al-Johari (left) is a well-known journalist in Jordan while Khrais is a lawyer and pro-Assad activist

Al-Johari, well-known in his homeland for his strong anti-Assad views, hurled a bottle of water at Mr Khrais and then his pen.

When Khrais and tries clumsily to lift his chair, the bigger al-Johari went for him, wresting the seat from his grasp before attempting to beat him with it.

He also threatened to beat Khrais with his belt.Â

Violence: Fortunately, the brawl was brought to a bitter end by the show's host and a producer, who stepped in before the programme descended into further mayhem

It is the second time al-Johari attempted to beat a debate rival while discussing the crisis in Syria.

In May, he tried to fight Mohammed Al-Jayousi when they disagreed about an issue and began hurling abuse at each other on TV channel 7 Stars.

As if the war of words wasn't embarrassing enough on live television, the pair then became physical - standing up and violently shoving the desk on set at each other until it collapsed.

The two men were appearing on a show called Between Opposing Opinions, presented by Zuhair Al-Azza.

Mr Al-Johari is the head of the Electronic Media Association in Jordan, while Mr Al-Jayousi is the editor-in-chief of news website al-Mustaqbal al-Arabi.

It is understood Mr Al-Johari attacked Mr Al-Jayousi for his support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
