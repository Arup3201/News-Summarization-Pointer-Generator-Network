Angel Sanches, 17, has been arrested on suspicion of strangling cousin Katherine Gonzalez, five, to death and hanging her body in a closet

A 17-year-old illegal immigrant has been arrested on suspicion of strangling his five-year-old cousin to death before leaving her body hanging in a closet.

Angel Sanches was arrested after the Katherine Gonzalez's body was found inside a vacant apartment in Lake Highlands, Dallas, on Sunday afternoon.

Sanches has denied the accusations, telling police that he was merely an accomplice. 

The boy allegedly told officers his cousin followed him into the building after he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos'.

According to police, Sanches claimed 'Carlos' forced him into the building at gunpoint before shutting him in the closet.

Sanches says he then heard his cousin crying before leaving the apartment to check that neighbors were searching for the girl.

His arrest warrant says: 'He also explained that he is an "accomplice" but did not see the juvenile in the apartment after he exited the closet.' 

After being arrested, Sanches apparently told detectives 'I did not rape her' in Spanish.

Witness Freddie Washington says he saw Sanches lure Gonzalez into the abandoned housing block, telling the girl 'Come on, come on,' before the pair disappeared inside.

Mr Washington told WFAA 8: 'I think he waited for me to leave around the corner and then took her into the vacant apartment.' 

According to reports, Gonzalez was staying with her uncle at the time of the attack because both of her parents were at work.

Officers were called to reports that Gonzalez had gone missing, and after a thorough search found her body hanging in the closet.

Gonzalez' body was found in an abandoned property in this block of apartments on Sunday. Sanches claims he was taken hostage by a man named 'Carlos' before his cousin followed him in and he escaped

Investigators say they have taken mouth swabs and fingernail clippings from Sanches to compare to DNA found at the scene.

Sanches has been charged with capital murder though he is not eligible for the death penalty as he is only 17.

Police said he is an undocumented immigrant who has lived in the U.S. for six months to a year.
