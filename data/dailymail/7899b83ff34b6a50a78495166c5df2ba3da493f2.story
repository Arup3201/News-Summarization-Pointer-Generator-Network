A hot new fashion label dressing everyone from Taylor Swift to Lily Aldridge in the U.S. has struck a chord on British shores.

UK fashion icons such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Alexa Chung and even Cressida Bonas have been spotted wearing styles from the cool new Reformation brand this summer.

Their cutting-edge co-ords, floral maxis and spaghetti strap slips have earned them a place in the most A-list of wardrobes. And the best bit: this celebrity label is actually affordable.

With prices starting at £40 for a top and going up to about £150 for a dress, the profile of America's newest cult clothing label is about to soar.

Celebrities like the label because everything is produced in limited amounts, meaning that it's unlikely anyone will show up to an an event wearing the same thing as them.

Reformation dressmakers either up-cycle vintage threads or create something new out of leftover fabrics

Cressida, 25, recently chose a pretty £150 cutaway maxi dress for the marriage of Arabella Llewellyn and Thomas Burwel in Hampshire.

Designer and owner Yael Aflalo, from 
Los Angeles, hailed the style of Prince Harry's former girlfriend during a recent interview with Grazia.

'First of 
all I think Cressida looked absolutely lovely, and second I can't tell 
you how rewarding these moments are for me. I know it's a challenge to 
get dressed for a wedding,' Yael Aflalo said.

'So
 much of what I design is for a modern woman who doesn't want to adjust 
her style or buy a dress she will never wear again - especially when it 
comes to getting dressed for a wedding.

'Cressida
 looked totally appropriate by accessorizing our Charles dress with 
heels and a clutch, and she would look equally appropriate throwing on a
 pair of sandals and wearing it to lunch with friends.'

The brand has been flying under the radar since Yael Aflalo started it as a sustainably conscious side project five years ago.

But with two flagship stores in Los Angeles and New York City and a growing list of celebrity clients, Yael can safely say it's now a full-time job.

Lily Aldridge, Harley Viera Newton and Taylor Swift - who has been seen in their cute polka-dot two piece - are all fans.

The brand has had a celebrity following since the start thanks to their eco ethos, and figure-flattering designs

And for those Brits after some of those festival-inspired, boho fashion vibes there's even free shipping to the UK.
