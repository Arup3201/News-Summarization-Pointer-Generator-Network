New York mayor-elect Bill de Blasio has been given policing advice by ex-cons - who think the system should be softer on them.

Thousands of New Yorkers have helped shape the Democrat's policy since his landslide victory over Republican Joe Lhota on November 5.

And among them were 50 ex-criminals brought together in a think tank run by the billionaire investor George Soros, the New York Post reported.

Speech: Mr de Blasio in the Talking Transition tent in downtown Manhattan on Wednesday. One event held has part of the campaign involved 50 ex-criminals - who suggested the mayor-elect should be softer on them

The newspaper interviewed several of the attendees - whose crimes ranged from manslaughter and robbery to identity theft.

Arthur Castillo, 38, who was convicted of assault and possessing stolen property, said: 'Cops won’t leave us alone. Newly released prisoners are watched by the police and a lot of us 
don’t feel we have an opportunity to readapt to normal life because we 
are treated as criminals even though we are free.'

He added: 'A lot of money is spent on the prison 
system - it should be used to cultivate prisoners' lives. The money should be redistributed to help those who want to change 
while they are incarcerated.'

Gregorio 'Koko' Cruz, 63, once convicted of first degree manslaughter, kidnapping and robbery, told the newspaper: 'Bloomberg forgot about all of us. I’m 
hoping de Blasio remembers us.'

Other ex-criminals reportedly wanted to end stop-and-frisk and make it easier for illegal immigrants to find work.

The Post reported that the event was part of a campaign called Talking Transition - which is led by liberal magnate Mr Soros - and was held in association with the rehabilitation group The Fortune Society.

Talking Transition's headquarters are in a tent in downtown Manhattan, which offers New Yorkers the chance to put their own suggestions to the mayor-elect before he takes office on January 1.

Voters are able to write their suggestions on a piece of paper and stick them on a wall.

All the suggestions, including those reportedly by the ex-cons, are due to be put to the new mayor's team.

Tomorrow, the two-week campaign will culminate in a public meeting at New York's Town Hall.

Thousands of residents have visited Talking Transition's events, including the mayor-elect's wife Chirlane McCray, 58, who stopped in on Tuesday for a whirlwind one-hour tour of the tent.

She told the New York Daily News: 'I like the idea that so many people have come in here and talked about what their priorities are for the city and the direction the city should go in.'

De Blasio did not appear at the event which involved the ex-criminals.

The Democrat, who served as the New York City Public Advocate since 2010, won more than 73 per cent of the vote in the mayoral election on November 5.

Yesterday outgoing mayor Michael Bloomberg, who left the Republican party to turn independent in 2007, said his successor would be left with a balanced budget for the first time in a generation.

The mayor of 12 years claimed he has closed a $2 billion deficit 
which had been predicted in the city's $72.7 billion budget for fiscal year 2015, which begins on 
July 1.

'For the first time in modern memory and 
perhaps for the first time in New York City history, the budget for the 
incoming fiscal year has been balanced for an incoming mayor well before
he or she steps into office,' he told a news conference.
