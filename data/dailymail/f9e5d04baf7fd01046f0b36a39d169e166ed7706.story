A TV beauty dating space sky diver Felix Baumgartner has been ordered to delete Facebook rants branding a celebrity magazine boss a 'notorious blackmailer.'

Romanian screen star Mihaela Radulescu, 45, claimed Ciao magazine owner Radu Budeanu, 35, regularly blackmailed stars over sex and drug scandals.

In one rant she said: 'This respectable Mr Budeanu, who calls himself a journalist, is specialised in blackmailing public people, and don't only think of stars, but of politicians in the election campaign.'

Mihaela Radulescu (left, on the set of Romania's Got Talent) said Ciao magazine owner Radu Budeanu, 35, regularly blackmailed stars over sex and drug scandals

And she claimed he had made most of his multi-million pound fortune from entrapping and extorting stars.

Miheala - presenter of Romania's Got Talent - said: 'Don't think it's from that poor magazine that barely finds its way to the kiosk and it's public - but from the extra pictures and audio or video recordings that were kept in the bag of the paparazzi.

'A husband cheating on his wife, an illegal transaction recorded from a distance, a set-up.'

Budeanu - who is suing the presenter for defamation - had asked a judge to order the TV star to delete all her Facebook posts about him in the first round of the libel case. The judge agreed and ordered the posts removed.

But now Mihaela claims she is about to turn the tables on Budeanu.

Pilot Felix Baumgartner of Austria exits his capsule as he begins his record-setting skydive over Roswell, New Mexico on October 14, 2012. Baumgartner broke a 52-year-old record by skydiving from 23 miles

She said: 'I've got a bunch of information to give about him to pay him back for the nonsense he writes about me.'

Mihaela is currently dating sky diving daredevil Felix Baumgartner, 45, who set a world sky diving record in 2012 when he leapt from the stratosphere 128,100 feet (39,045 metres) above the Earth.

Referring to her new relationship with Felix, she said this week: 'He's a sort of superman. I'm dating a hero.'

She added: 'At the beginning, any love makes you blossom, makes you bloom, and I'm living this stage. It's a story that is just at it's beginning'.
