Nineteen-time champion jump jockey AP McCoy drew level with 4,191 career wins of old boss Martin Pipe when lifting On The Record to a narrow win in the 32Red On The App Store Handicap Hurdle at Uttoxeter.

McCoy was a long-time stable jockey to 15-time champion trainer Pipe.

Matching his achievements was a personal milestone for McCoy rather than yet another record but it was achieved with a typical strong driving finish on a one-paced mount who was headed twice by runner-up Bangkok Pete.

Achievement: McCoy levelled Pipe's 4,191 wins on the appropriately named horse

Setting the pace: McCoy is on course to become the first jockey to ride 300 winners in a season

McCoy said: ‘I made hard work of it but this horse is obviously very appropriately named.

‘This is just a personal thing with Martin Pipe. We are good friends and there had been a lot of banter about it.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him up at Newmarket doing a trainer’s course – I hope I have driven him mad!’

Pipe, whose son David now runs the family stable in Somerset, has joked about re-applying for his trainer’s licence should McCoy pass him.

The jockey has five more rides to do that on Thursday.

After McCoy had drawn level with his father, David tweeted: ‘Could there be a more appropriate way for @AP_McCoy to join my father in the 4191 club than success aboard On The Record?! #McCoyWatch’.
