Crash investigators have said Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 broke up in the air over eastern Ukraine after it was struck by multiple 'high-energy objects from outside the aircraft'.

A newly-released report contains pictures of the downed airliner showing holes in the fuselage and cockpit which could have been caused by shrapnel from an exploding anti-aircraft missile. 

The carefully-worded initial report avoids saying that the plane was shot down or making any suggestion as to who was responsible.

A preliminary report into the disaster by the Dutch Safety Board said it was likely the damage caused 'resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.'

Mystery: Investigators said 'a large number of high-energy objects penetrated the aircraft from outside'

The Boeing 777 suddenly plunged out of the sky on July 17 over pro-Russian rebel-held territory in Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board.

The report said: 'The damage observed in the forward section of the aircraft appears to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft. 

'It is likely that this damage resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.'

The board is leading the international investigation into the cause of the disaster. Its full report is expected within a year of the crash.

Although the report drew no conclusions about responsibility, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the findings were consistent with 'our original assessment, that it was likely shot down by one of these surface-to-air missiles fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.'

'I'm unaware of other objects or ways that it could be brought down that are consistent with that finding,' Harf said of the report. 'It highlights questions for which Russia must still answer.'

Christopher Yates, an aviation safety specialist at Yates Consulting, said the report 'is extremely consistent with damage from a missile for the simple reason there are penetration marks'.

'It must have been moving at very high velocity to create the damage,' he said. 'It could only be a missile of the type that would reach the altitude that would have struck the aircraft' – potentially a Buk missile.

The slow pace of the inquiry, its cautious preliminary conclusion and the fact that wreckage and human remains are still lying in Ukraine frustrated and angered victims' families.

'Well, I don't know what to say about this,' said Samira Calehr, a Dutch mother who lost two sons, 11-year-old Miguel and 19-year-old Shaka, in the crash.

She said that she wants the people responsible for downing the plane brought to justice 'as soon as possible,' pausing for emphasis on every word. 'I want to know who killed my children.'

Zenaida Ecal, a 53-year-old resident of Pagbilao in the northeastern Philippines who lost her best friend, Irene Gunawan, expressed frustration that the report discloses only what many already knew - that the Malaysian plane came under fire - but fails to identify the perpetrators.

'We just want all of the victims to be found, identified and given a proper burial. We want the perpetrators to be identified and punished. As long as these don't happen, all the families and friends of the victims will continue to suffer,' Ecal said. 'It's taking so long.'

A separate Dutch-led criminal investigation is underway aimed at bringing the perpetrators to justice.

Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board that is leading the international investigation, acknowledged the preliminary report - mandated by international aviation guidelines - did not shed much new light on the downing of the Boeing 777.

'Perhaps you could say we are a little bit behind, but we are not behind with the truth. We try to make a report that's for the next of kin - very important - but also for history,' he said.

'I understand a lot of people say, `Why don't they work a little quicker?' But this will take its time,' he added.

Pro-Russian rebels officially deny having shot down the plane, but unofficially one senior rebel admitted they were behind a missile strike.

Just three hours before the plane was shot down above rebel-held territory in Eastern Ukraine, the Associated Press reported on the passage of a Buk M-1 missile system - a machine the size of a tank bearing four ground-to-air missiles - driving through the rebel-held town of Snizhne, near the crash site. 

The Buk uses a proximity fuse aboard the missile that determines when it will detonate, creating an explosion of shrapnel to destroy the target. 

Russian sources launched a scathing and concerted attack on the MH17 crash report yesterday evidently in a bid to undermine any future criticisms that missiles or military personnel from Moscow were responsible for the crash.

Several senior figures were given license to question the motives of the 'careless' Dutch-led investigation into the doomed Malaysia Airlines aircraft.

One suggested a Western plot to hide the real cause of the crash of the Malaysian Boeing 777-200, which among some figures in Moscow is blamed on the Ukrainian army.

Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander and the chairman of the public council of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia), declared:'I was totally shocked by the data published by the investigative commission.

'Did it take them so long to find out that the Boeing was in good repair? It was clear from the start there would be no claims against the airplane's serviceability.'

He said accusingly: 'The Netherlands is careless, it draws conclusions before examining the plane's debris and body fragments.' 

Meanwhile, rebel official in Donetsk, Miroslav Rudenko, told Interfax alleged that the downing the the plane was 'a provocation carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces in order to discredit Russia and the people's militia'.

Terrifying: There were three other commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the tragedy

A highly-placed rebel officer told the AP in an interview in the aftermath of the disaster that the plane was shot down by a mixed team of rebels and Russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane.

Intercepted phone conversations between the rebels released by the Ukrainian government support that version of events.

In those tapes, the first rebels to reach the scene can be heard swearing when they see the number of bodies and the insignia of Malaysia Airlines.

In a statement, the board's chairman Tjibbe Joustra said: 'The initial results of the investigation point toward an external cause of the MH17 crash.

'More research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision. The Safety Board believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead.'

Because of the ongoing conflict between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces, investigators from the board have not visited the fields where the wreckage of Flight 17 plunged to the ground.

'Detailed examination of the structural damage is ongoing,' the report said. 'Forensic examination will be performed if the wreckage can be removed.'

Investigators so far have studied photos of the crash site, radar data and information gleaned from the downed jet's 'black boxes' - its cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. They all indicated that there was no technical fault that may have caused the plane to disintegrate.

The cockpit voice recorder 'revealed no signs of any technical faults or an emergency situation,' the Safety Board said. 'Neither were any warning tones heard in the cockpit that might have pointed to technical problems.'

Christopher Yates, an aviation safety specialist at Yates Consulting, told The Associated Press the report 'is extremely consistent with damage from a missile for the simple reason there are penetration marks.'

'It must have been moving at very high velocity to create the damage,' he said. 'It could only be a missile of the type that would reach the altitude that would have struck the aircraft.'

He said the report gave no indication whether the missile had been fired from the ground or from another aircraft, but it likely came from the ground as there were no military aircraft known to have been flying at the time.

The missile could not have been shoulder-fired because it would not have reached the necessary altitude, Yates added.
