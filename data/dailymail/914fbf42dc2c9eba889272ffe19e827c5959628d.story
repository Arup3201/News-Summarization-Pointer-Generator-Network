A woman died after being stabbed 20 times in the face and chest by her brother in an apparent 'honour killing' because she went out of the house alone, police in Jordan said.

Authorities said the man confessed to slitting his sister's throat and stabbing her repeatedly to 'cleanse the family honour'.

Local media said she had become enraged because she spent too little time at home.

A police spokesman said: 'People last night found the body of a girl in her twenties.

'She had been stabbed 20 times in face 
and chest before she had her throat slit.

'Police arrested her brother, who confessed to committing the crime 
because his sister spent so little time at the family home.

'His 
confession indicates that he sought to cleanse the family honour.'

It is the second so-killed honour killing in the country in the past two weeks.

On April 15, police said they found the burned body of a pregnant woman whose throat had been slit and her stomach cut open.

Police found her charred corpse in a dumper, after it 
had been partially burned with an accelerant.

Unmarried women in many Arab countries are still expected to come home before dusk and are often suspected of engaging in sexual activities if they do not.

Although there is greater freedom among the expanding middle classes in the Arab world, sex outside marriage is still considered to bring an intolerable shame on a conservative Muslim family.

Between 15 and 20 women die in 'honour' murders each year in the Arab Kingdom, despite government efforts to curb such crimes.

But not all those who kill the women are brought to justice.

In the case of the latest victim, police know that there is no ‘victim family’ to take into consideration and often do not bother filing charges.

Murder is however punishable by death in Jordan but in honour killings courts can commute or reduce sentences, particularly if the victim's family asks for leniency.
