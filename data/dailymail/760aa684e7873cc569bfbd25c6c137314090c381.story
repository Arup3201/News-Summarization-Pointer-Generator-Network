Scotland's most expensive hotel has closed just two years after owners spent £5 million on the initial project.

The Atholl, located in Edinburgh's posh West End, broke barriers when it became the first Scottish hotel to charge £1,000 per night in April 2012.

Despite high expectations on the luxe property, the uber-expensive hotel proved to be just too excessive - at nearly four times the rate charged by nearby five-star hotels.

The Atholl Hotel has permanently closed its doors just two years after the initial £5 million investment

Rooms at The Atholl broke the £1000-a-night barrier and were the first to charge that much in Scotland

The luxe hotel offered Michelin-starred dining from Albert Roux and an award-winning garden

Day to night: The Atholl was located on Atholl Crescent, which is one of the poshest areas of Edinburgh 

With the Georgian building's high price tag came Michelin-starred dining by Albert Roux, Hermes wallpaper favoured by the likes of Victoria Beckham, and an award-winning garden.

However, owner and Edinburgh businesswoman Alison Davies announced today that The Atholl has closed its doors for good. 

Tourists hoping to stay at the hotel realised this upon attempting to log on to the now defunct website or call the unavailable phone number. 

According to a spokesperson for Alison Davies, the hotel will now be converted into flats.

Other five-star hotels in Scotland charge only a fraction of the price - nearly four times less

The coveted property will now be turned into four individual flats, says a spokesperson for the owner

Peter Irvine, author of Scotland the Best, warned that The Atholl was 'ambitious' back in 2012.

Still, he remains upbeat upon hearing of its closure.

'There are now many options in Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland for "luxurious accommodation" - so no shortage of opportunities for the well-minted to spill their cash.'
