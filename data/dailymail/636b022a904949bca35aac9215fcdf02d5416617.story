The government has been ordered to pay compensation for the ‘injustice’ of inflicting misery on an elderly couple who were left without heating for three years by a bungled state-sponsored energy programme.

Donald Siteman told a parliamentary watchdog his three-bedroom home had become a ‘hell house’, with his dying wife Evelyn forced to wear her coat indoors and go to bed early in a desperate attempt to get warm.

A boiler installed under Labour’s £2.4billion Warm Front scheme broke down after just six months, beginning a tortuous battle to have it fixed which lasted through three bitterly cold winters.

A damning report found both the Department for Energy and Climate Change and its contractor Carillion guilty of ‘maladministration’, accusing them of inflicting ‘distress and physical and material hardship’ on an ‘elderly and vulnerable’ couple.

Donald and Evelyn Siteman signed up to the Warm Front scheme in 2009 to update their heating system, but endured three years of misery after it stopped working. Mrs Siteman died in October, having never seen the problem fixed

As a result of three years of excuses, 
mistakes and unresolved complaints, Mr Siteman experienced ‘distress and
physical and material hardship’ which would have been ‘amplified 
because he also had to watch his wife, who was unwell, also suffer’, the
Parliamentary Ombudsman said.

Mrs Siteman, 85, died from tongue cancer in October. The inquiry was told that one of the last things she said to her husband while being treated in hospital was to ask if the heating problems had been fixed.

The Ombudsman ordered DECC to pay Mr Siteman £1,000 in addition to a raft of remedial work at the property in Wembley, north London to put right the mess left by Carillion after installing the boiler in 2009.

The contractor repeatedly refused to put the problem right, and only acted after a complaint was made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman about the dysfunctional Warm Front Scheme.

Mr Siteman, who turned 90 on Saturday, told MailOnline that after three years without heating and the death of his wife he was forced to move out of his home altogether after during the unusually cold winter at the end of 2012.

‘It was grim’, he said. ‘I had electric heaters going but it didn’t make any difference. It was so cold it was unbelievable. I moved out and was staying with my daughter.’

DECC was severely criticised for its role in the ‘emotional and physical distress’ the couple suffered’.

The ministry first learned of the 
problems in October 2010, but it took two years before a remedy was 
found and the house had already been without heating for a year.

Labour MP Barry Gardiner, a former environment minister, said: ‘This was more than incompetence and maladministration.

‘It was a heartless refusal to help 
an elderly couple whose home Carillion had wrecked under a government 
scheme that was supposed to keep them safe and warm.

‘I am delighted that the Ombudsman has
now secured substantial compensation for Mr Siteman. The only tragedy 
is that his wife passed away just before Christmas and did not survive 
to see the Ombudsman’s report.’ The couple live in Mr Gardiner’s Brent 
North constituency.

The boiler was installed in 2009 but six months later it stopped working, leaving the Sitemans without heating for three years (file picture)

Mr Siteman would often wear a coat in 
the house and wore a dressing gown to bed, which had an electric blanket
and three further blankets on top.

The couple would go to bed during the 
day, not to sleep but to keep warm while running up electricity bills 
using heaters to warm the kitchen – where they ‘effectively lived’ as 
the only room they were able use comfortably.

Getting dressed was ‘horrible’ and the experience reminded Mr Siteman of ‘wartime’, he told the Ombudsman.

The devastating report said: ‘Mr 
Siteman said that he would often wake up early, at 5am, to put the 
electric heaters on so his wife could be warm when she got up. Mrs Siteman, 
who was 85 at the time, would sit in the kitchen with her arms on the 
radiator to try and get warm.

‘Throughout the time they did not have
heating, Mrs Siteman was very unwell. This turned out to be the symptoms of 
the tongue cancer that she eventually died from.

‘Mr Siteman was distressed when 
talking about his wife and the suffering she must have felt being unwell
and freezing cold on top of that.

‘He said that one of the last things 
his wife said to him when she was ill in hospital before she died was to
ask him if the heating had been put in yet.

‘He said that she must have really suffered to still be thinking about the heating at that time.’

The
Ombudsman said it was clear that Carillion failed to carry out work to 
meet Mr Siteman’s needs, and stopped working altogether within six 
months of being installed.

‘The
purpose of Warm Front was to tackle fuel poverty by ensuring people 
without working heating systems got working heating systems,’ the report
added, arguing both DECC and Carillion should have recognised that they
had failed to meet this basic objective.

Mr Siteman was persuaded to sign up to
the scheme update the working heating system in the three-bedroom home 
the couple had lived in since 1962.

Carillion carried out a survey of the Sitemans’ home in February 2009, and a boiler was installed in July that year.

But
in January 2010, Mr Siteman complained to Carillion that his house was 
not warming up, including having problems with the water pressure and 
thermostat. Some remedial work was carried out in February 2010, but 
this made little difference.

Labour MP Barry Gardiner condemned the 'heartless refusal' of the government to intervene earlier

Mr Siteman made a formal complaint in May 2010 about the suitability of the boiler and the fact it had been put in a place that he was not happy with. They promised to carry out a ‘power slush’ to remove sludge and debris from the pipework and radiators in August.

In October that year he complained to the DECC, and they promised a power flush in November but the firm and ministry kept blaming the properties old pipework. It was not until March 2012 that Carillion finally admitted it had put the boiler 90 degrees from it should have been, and said the heating system no longer met Mr Siteman’s needs.

They offered to replace the boiler in the position originally agreed and fit new radiators in the lounge, but Mr Siteman considered the offer to ‘inadequate’ and complained to the Ombudsman.

As a result, Carillion upped its offer and has installed a better boiler, new radiators and underground pipes and is planning to make good the kitchen and redecorate and pay £1,500 in compensation.

While the firm had now gone beyond what was required under guidance, these actions were only ‘reasonable, adequate and fair’ given the suffering the family experienced.

A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: 'The customer service provided on this occasion was unacceptable and we are writing to Mr Siteman directly to express our most sincere apologies that the service he received was far from the usual high standard. 

'We have worked with Carillion, who run Warm Front, to ensure that Mr Siteman now has a suitable heating system installed in his home which he is happy with.

'Warm Front has helped around 2.3million vulnerable households since 2000. Overall customer satisfaction remains high for the scheme.'

A Carillion spokesman said: ‘We acknowledge and accept the findings of this report and would apologise unreservedly for what has clearly been a difficult time.

‘The heating system is now fully operational and we are in contact with Mr Siteman to discuss additional measures as a goodwill gesture.

‘Warm Front assisted more than 2.3 million households in England during its existence, helping to make their homes warmer and more affordable to heat. On this occasion service levels clearly fell short of the high standards set.’
