His glorious afro hairstyle captured the public imagination and according to some commentators has become a key factor in the race to elect the next New York City Mayor.

Now Dante de Blasio, the 15-year-old son of mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio, is putting his locks on display once again in a second advert for his father's campaign.    

The first spot saw the young, 
softly-spoken Dante making the case for his father's life and policies, 
including his opposition to controversial police tactic of 
stop-and-frisk.

His natural presence behind the camera coupled with his eye-catching retro hairdo quickly made him a Twitter star, leading to the light-hearted hashtag #fromentum.

The sequel continues on a similar theme with Mr de Blasio talking about being the father of a bi-racial teenage boy and how he had to prepare his son for the day he is stopped by police.

It sees Mr de Blasio, his wife and his son around the kitchen table of their home in Park Slope, Brooklyn.

Then in a voice over Mr de Blasio says: 'I wish everyone could see through the eyes of every other parent. These are all our children,'

He then tells the camera: 'There are hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who have never experienced stop-and-frisk.

'Chirlane and I have talked to Dante many times about the fact that someday, he will be stopped. Parents all over the city are having that conversation with their kids.'

So far Dante says he is unphased by his and his hair's new found celebrity status.

He told DNAinfo New York:  'Honestly, for years my hair was really just for me. I didn't think people would love it so much.

'A lot of people recognize me. Some people want to take photos and I’m really just happy.

He said he has been cultivating his afro since the third grade, after falling in love with the hairstyle made prominent in the 60s and 70s.

He added: 'I have to pick it out every day and I wash it every week and I get trimmed about once a month'

Meanwhile his father is now neck and neck with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn,  with the Democratic primary less than a month away, according to the latest poll of Democratic primary voters.

Mr de Blasio's key policies is to reduce the NYPD’s use of stop and frisk and he has also said he would replace Raymond Kelly as police commissioner.

He has consistently attacked the New 
York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program - stopping and searching
people deemed to be acting suspiciously - as discriminatory to blacks 
and Hispanics.

Last week the campaign received a boost when a judge 
appointed a federal monitor to oversee the department. Bloomberg's 
administration has taken the first steps to appeal the judge's ruling.

Mr de Blasio, 52, also proposes raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-kindergarten.

He repeatedly uses the phrase 'A tale of two cities' to rip the economic inequality between the rich and poor in the nation's largest city and supports calls for more affordable housing.

De Blasio has aggressively courted minority voters, who are expected to make up more than 50 percent of the electorate on primary day Sept. 10.

He has won endorsements from several black and Latino elected officials and the city's largest labor union, composed largely of minority workers.
