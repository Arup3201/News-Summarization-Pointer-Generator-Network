Alan Irvine is a diligent and talented football manager who is attempting to succeed on limited resources at West Bromwich. Last week, a bookmaker announced that his chances of being the first Premier League manager to be sacked this season were no better than 6-5.

‘Even as his odds have tumbled, the money has continued to come in for Irvine to go,’ drivelled the hack hired by William Hill to deliver these crass tidings.

Nigel Pearson of Leicester is equally industrious, equally capable. His chances of suffering the same fate were assessed at 3-1. Brendan Rodgers of Liverpool, a manager of the first rank, was similarly out of favour after losing to Manchester United last Sunday.

As the bookie’s runner sensitively explained: ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ was the song directed at Rodgers by United’s fans, and while it may not be that quick, William Hill offer 6-5 that the Liverpool boss has left Anfield by the end of the season. Following a League Cup win at Bournemouth, Rodgers’ survival prospects moved to a relatively soothing 11–2.

Now, the chancers who devise these witless humiliations tend to pass them off as no more than a whimsical flutter, what their charmless trade calls ‘a fun bet’. The fact that they are undermining the dignity of decent professionals is clearly of no concern, since pliant fools will take the gamble and hustlers will accommodate their folly. Clearly there is money to be made from potential unemployment.

In any case, it really doesn’t matter, because they’re ‘only’ football managers. But suppose we applied a comparable test to the directors of a company such as William Hill? Who’ll be the first to leave? What about the chairman, Gareth Davis? Before joining Hill’s, Mr Davis spent 38 years serving the public interest at Imperial Tobacco. He has been an enthusiastic 40-a-day puffer, and is now 64 years old. Wheezingly good value at 6-5?

Then there’s the chief executive officer, James Henderson, who has worked for Hill’s for almost three decades but was appointed CEO a few months ago. An amply-built Glaswegian, he says: ‘I have a forthright fashion. I am opinionated.’ Survival chance: 3-1 sounds reasonable. Finally, the group finance director, Neil Cooper. This 47-year-old accountant has been with Hill’s for almost five years and, if he has uttered one contentious public statement, then he has kept it well hidden. Sound survival value at 11-2.

Brendan Rodgers has come under increasing pressure at Liverpool after a string of poor results

Demeaning, is it not? Yet if it’s good enough for widely respected managers, then it’s certainly good enough for a bunch of bookies.

Now if all this suggests that football is being heartlessly exploited by betting interests, then the suggestion is quite wrong. For the game positively embraces gambling, to the extent that four Premier League clubs — Aston Villa, Burnley, Hull and Stoke — have their shirts sponsored by gaming companies, while the Championship, League One and League Two carry the title name of Sky Bet. Some will see a certain irony in the fact that last year Hull’s shirt was sponsored by a pay-day lender, before they transferred their allegiance to the firm which offers ‘Asia’s best online sports betting and gambling’.

The dangers have been obvious for a long time. Although players are banned from betting on football, a climate has been created in which betting is the natural, inevitable, wholly acceptable partner of the sport. As if the example of international cricket were not sufficient warning, in recent years security experts have told us that match- fixing is ‘endemic’ in football. Yet still the game closes its eyes and ears while selling its shirt and its soul for a bookmaker’s cheque.

It is difficult to imagine circumstances which will compel the national sport to face the perils. And so it staggers along its slippery path, its stadiums swimming with seductive odds, its matches punctuated by the uproar of pushers and peddlers.

And it is miserably certain, that a truly titanic scandal waits in the wings; no longer a slim possibility, but merely a matter of time.

Keegan, the blood lab monster, rips up the darts script

Keegan Brown celebrates his famous victory

Long, long ago, when darts tournaments were conducted in provincial town halls and champions were strangers to national celebrity, I was given the task of interviewing the players.

Then, as now, they tended to be stoutly lumbering fellows, with shirt-stretching paunches and insatiable thirsts. They had no illusions that what they were playing had anything to do with ‘sport’. No, it was a pub game: no more, no less.

Unfailingly amiable and occasionally incoherent, they would offer standard reflections: ‘Nice game. Good arrows. Can’t hang about, my mate’s got me a pint.’

That last one was always the killer. I had prepared my questions about hopes, fears and ambitions, but nobody ever uttered a single memorable word. The most interesting character was one I encountered in a Suffolk Corn Exchange. A large, ponderous man, he was starting to outline his career plans when he stepped backwards and toppled off the stage. As he lay, stunned, upon the stone floor, his anxious friends surrounded him. One offered him a healing lager, which he seized and sank in a gulp. I looked at my empty notebook and realised I was chasing a lost cause.

I could, therefore, imagine the relief today’s darting scribblers must have felt when they encountered Keegan Brown. He is not only a darts player, but also a medical lab assistant in blood services. More, he is named after Kevin Keegan, a family hero. Still more, he defeated John Part, thrice a world champion, in the opening match of the World Darts Championship.

But far and above all this was what he said in the moment of victory. ‘If someone had told me I was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the World Championships,’ mused Keegan, ‘I would have ripped their two arms and two legs off. This is what dreams are made of.’ The imagery may be disturbing, but the impact is sensational.

After generations of irredeemably dull darts players, we now have a monster from the blood laboratory who dreams of ripping off arms and legs.

Keegan Brown is interesting! But where was he when I needed him?

PS

Kevin Pietersen played a fine innings of 66 for the Melbourne Stars in the so-called Big Bash in Adelaide. Then, because he is terminally gauche, he announced: ‘Someone told me the England selectors were meeting this morning — I hope they’ve got a screen on.’ The broadcaster Ten Network asked its audience if Pietersen should play for England in next year’s World Cup. Some 72 per cent replied ‘Yes’. Two pertinent facts: (A) This was Pietersen’s first half-century since May — 16 innings ago. (B) Ten Network is an Australian broadcaster and the viewers urging his selection are Australian. Before the usual courtiers swoon clean away, they might pause to wonder if A and B may possibly be connected.

PPS

Pietersen celebrated his return to form by scoring just one run in his next innings. Yet still he could tweet to Eoin Morgan: ‘Great news that @Eoin16 is new England 1-day captain. Top player, leader and bloke. Hope I get to play for him’. On reflection, ‘gauche’ is far too kind a term for such unrelenting buffoonery. 

Kevin Pietersen hit 66 on Thursday but could only manage a solitary run two days later for Melbourne Stars
