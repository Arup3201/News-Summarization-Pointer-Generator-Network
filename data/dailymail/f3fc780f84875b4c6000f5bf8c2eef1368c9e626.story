The Palazzo Versace hotel in Australia, famous for housing the bruised egos of soap stars, ageing entertainers and politicians who have been evicted from ITV's I’m A Celebrity, is about to welcome a new set of VIP's: Very Important Pets.

The super-plush hotel has become the first dog-friendly five-star on the whole of the country's Gold Coast, and offers gourmet doggy room service, designer futons and walkies with the doting concierge... for £351 a night.

The Palazzo Pooch Package - as it is 
dubbed - maintains that 'not only you but also your beloved four-legged 
friend can receive the royal treatment at the world's first fashion 
branded hotel'.

Puppy palace: The service costs £350 per night

Equipped with a canine couture designer pet bed and Versace crystal food and water bowls, the Superior Pet Room aims to provide the ultimate indulgent getaway in true Versace style.

Four-legged guests will be in 
the lap of luxury with their own super-soft futon bed from Posh Pets, 
discounts on fashionable canine couture and the chance to hang out at fine-dining restaurant, Vie.

The Palazzo Pooch Package includes accommodation for two people and one dog, specially designed room service options, a pet gift menu (and even disposable bags for clearing up posh little messes) on arrival.

The
Palazzo Pet Package is priced from $509 (£351) per night for one 
pampered pooch. A surcharge of $80 (£55) per night applies for a second 
pet.

Man's best friend: The new hotel package is designed with pet lovers in mind, for those who don't want to leave their precious pups in kennels whilst holidaying

In the past, only companion dogs and
guide dogs were allowed on premises, but with recent legislation 
changes it's possible for pets to travel with their owners.

Gold
Coast Tourism CEO Martin Winter said for some people a visit to the 
Gold Coast wasn't complete without the addition of their pets as part of
the family holiday or weekend away.

Speaking
to goldcoast.com, he said: 'The Gold Coast City Council has ensured the
provision of dog-friendly beach and park areas to be enjoyed by locals 
and visitors, plus there are accommodation outlets and other local 
businesses that provide for pets as a distinct point of difference.'
