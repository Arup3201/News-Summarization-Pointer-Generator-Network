A U.S. senator has revealed he has never sent an email despite completing 12 years in office.

South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham insisted that he would happily let anyone look at his emails because he had never needed to send one.  

The comments were made on Meet the Press during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy.

But Graham, who was a congressman for eight years before becoming a senator, insisted that he had nothing to hide.

'I don't email. No, you can have every email I've ever sent. I've never sent one,' he revealed on Sunday's Meet the Press.

'I don't know what that makes me.'

The 59-year-old told Chuck Todd that it was crucial to get an independent body to retrieve and vet Clinton's emails properly.

Senior figures in Congress are already intensifying their scrutiny of the former secretary of state's communications from 2009-13, which they say were not conducted via official State Department accounts.

Clinton has handed over 55,000 pages of communications from the time - but it has been claimed that the documents have 'huge gaps'.

One image, which Clinton has used as her Twitter profile picture for the last year, has also been studied  to suggest that vital communications are being deliberately held from public view.

It shows a stony-faced Clinton using her mobile while heading to Tripoli on a C-military plane in September 2011.

Rep. Trey Gowdy told CBS News he had been provided with no emails from the 2011 trip - despite Clinton being pictured allegedly communicating while aboard the plane.

He said: 'There are gaps of months and months and months. 

The comments were made during a discussion about the controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server and personal email account to conduct foreign policy. This image of Clinton, taking during a 2011 trip, is also being scrutinized 

'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip.

'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.' 

President Obama has also revealed he heard that Clinton used a private email account to conduct official state business at 'the same time as everybody else' when news reports surfaced.
