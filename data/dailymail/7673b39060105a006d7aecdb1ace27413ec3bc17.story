It looks like a scene from a bygone age, a time when dinosaurs still roamed the Earth.

But these breathtaking aerial images are very much from the present day, although they do show what is believed to be one of the oldest geological formations on the planet.

The pictures show Mount Roraima, the highest tepui, or table-top mountain, in Venezuela, on the northern coast of South America.

Mighty: The flat-topped Mount Roraima towers above Venezuela and many of the clouds too

Towering: Mount Roraima, in Venezuela, towers 2,810m above the ground.

Ancient: Mount Roraima is said to be one of the oldest geological formations on Earth

Panoramic vista: Mount Roraima can be seen among the tepuis on the horizon

The peak is 2,810m above sea level and is so tall that clouds can be seen below the summit.

Despite its height, the mountain is not the tallest peak in South America.

That honour goes to the 6,962m (22,840ft) tall Aconcagua, located in the Andes range of mountains in Argentina.

Majestic: Mount Roraima is so high that clouds can be seen below its summit

Breathtaking: Mount Roraima seen from the air

Summit: A formation known as Turtle Rock can be found at the top of Mount Roraima

Otherwordly: The poster from the 1975 film The Land That Time Forgot
