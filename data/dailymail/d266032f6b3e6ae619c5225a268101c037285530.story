Patients are being left in pain because NHS cost-cutting means care is being rationed, a report warns today.

Hip replacements, cataract surgery and weight loss treatments are being graded as ‘low clinical value’ in a bid to save money.

But there are ‘widespread’ fears the rationing of minor treatments will harm patients’ quality of life and lead to more serious complications later.

Hip and knee operations, cataract operations and weight loss treatment are being rationed to save money, MPs warn, harming the quality of life of patients

The NHS is in the grip of the so0called Nicholson Challenge to find £20billion of efficiency savings in four years to 2015.

But the powerful Public Accounts Committee warns that health trusts are simply cutting costs and postponing treatment rather than finding ways to provide care more cheaply.

It even linked the impact of financial pressures to the Mid-Staffordshire scandal in which up to 1,2000 needlessly died as a result of poor care and neglect.

Chairman Margaret Hodge said: ‘The NHS
has achieved its financial savings target, but this has in large part 
come from freezing wages.

‘We are concerned that other savings are being achieved by rationing patients’ access to certain treatments.

‘These include cataract surgery and 
hip and knee replacements. These procedures are described as being ‘of 
low clinical value’, but people waiting for these operations suffer pain
and a poorer quality of life.

‘Furthermore, the finances of some 
trusts are fragile, and there is a risk they may resort to simple 
cost-cutting rather than finding genuine efficiency savings.’

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the PAC, warned the rationing of care could create long-term health problems

The report criticises the Department of Health and the NHS Commissioning Board, the new body set up under the health reforms charged with the running of the health service, saying they are ‘not doing enough’ to help organisations reform services.

The NHS claims to have saved £5.8billion in 201-12, but less than two thirds of the savings could be proved through national data.

Nursing and doctors groups insisted that treatment must always be based on need not cost, but warned that care was being rationed.

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Not only are certain treatments being rationed, we are also concerned that nursing care itself is starting to be rationed.

‘Of course the NHS has to be financially healthy, but this won't be achieved in the long term if trusts are living on the edge, either financially or in terms of care.

‘Financial instability, a reduced and demoralised workforce and a lack of focus on quality care have been shown to be a recipe for disaster in the NHS.’

The PAC said the Francis report into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust scandal showed how ‘financial pressures may already be causing some hospital trusts to cut staff with damaging effects on the quality and safety of care’.

The MPs warned that the NHS ‘must fundamentally change the way that healthcare is provided’ including moving services out of hospitals and into the community.

Royal College of Surgeons president Professor Norman Williams added: ‘Patients' access to treatment should always be driven by clinical need, not compromised by financial pressure.

‘Despite assurances that patients would not be denied treatment because of the NHS savings drive, we are concerned that today's important report highlights that this is still happening.

‘Such a short-term approach creates a false economy and could well lead to higher costs as patients may then need longer, more complex treatment.’

Labour's shadow health minister Jamie Reed said: ‘This is the third time this week that the Government has been told by experts that its cuts to the NHS are hitting patients. Ministers cannot go on ignoring these warnings.

‘The committee is right to highlight the increasing numbers of patients now being denied treatment in a short-sighted bid to cut costs.

‘Patients will find this particularly galling in the same week that George Osborne's Budget took £2.2 billion away from the Department of Health.’

Meanwhile Chancellor George Osborne has been accused of trying to 'claw back' more than £2billion from the NHS in order to make his Budget sums add up.

Labour said detailed figures in the Budget 'red book' appeared to show that health was underspent by £2.2 billion and that the money would not be carried forward into future years.

The Department of Health (DH) confirmed that there had been an underspend but insisted the money would still be available to NHS organisations.

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused ministers of mounting a 'raid' on the health budget, despite promising to protect the NHS.

He said: 'David Cameron cannot justify cutting the front-line NHS to pay for his failed economic policies.

'At a time when the NHS is facing its biggest financial challenge, when almost 5,000 nursing posts have been lost since the general election, and when one in 10 hospitals are understaffed, I find it staggering that £2.2 billion of the NHS budget is to be returned to the Treasury.'

However a Department of Health spokesman insisted the NHS would not lose out as a result of the underspend.

He said: 'The Government is meeting its promise to deliver a real terms increase in health spending. Health spending will increase by one per cent in real terms this year compared to last year and 0.5 per cent compared to 2009-10.

'Any NHS underspend will still be available for NHS organisations to ensure high quality, sustainable health services are delivered to patients now and in the future.
