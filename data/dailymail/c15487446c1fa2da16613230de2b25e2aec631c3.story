Look out Heston, Rachel Khoo is giving your inventive cooking some competition!

The Little Paris Kitchen chef today unveiled the world's first patisserie where everything is cooked using steam.

The Steam Patisserie has opened as a pop-up on London's Regent Street and Rachel Khoo, 33, kicked off proceedings with a demonstration of some of her famous Parisian cooking using the steam ovens.

The ovens come from high-end appliance maker Miele and allow cooks to achieve a professional level of cooking in their own home with a combination of a conventional fan oven and steam.

Rachel cooked an appetising array of cakes including brioche buns, fruit tartlets and chocolate sponge in order to display the diversity of cooking with steam.

By using steam cooks can avoid using cooking oil or fat resulting in a much lighter, healthier treat.

Despite the lower fat content, Rachel insists that flavour isn't compromised and that steam can actually produce a better bake

The ovens are also designed to retain the food's natural nutrients, vitamins and minerals.

Often lighter treats can mean tasteless results but Rachel is keen to stress that no flavour is lost - and, if anything, the steam can improve the taste of a cake.

'Steam ovens are perfect for delicious patisseries and breads - anything where 'rise' is important.

'The moisture injection function helps not only to create lift and rise, but also produces a lovely thin, light crust together with the lightest pastry imaginable.'

Dominic Worsley the marketing director at Miele, believes that cooking with steam is a real innovation.

Free patisseries will be available in store between 2-4 July

'Steam Patisserie demonstrates the amazing things that combining steam with heat can achieve in your own home.

'Steam is a powerful tool in the kitchen and it's not just for cooking your vegetables. There's virtually no limit to what can be cooked in a combination steam oven.'

He also agrees that steam can help to produce some of the best baking results possible.

'For baking we firmly believe it's the appliance which will give you the best possible results, from the airiest brioche to a perfectly glossy crust on sourdough bread.

'It doesn't just lock in moisture for incredible texture, but also helps to give pastry the best possible crust.

'This is something that has never been done before, so we can't wait to hear what people think.'

Free pastries will be available at the Steam Patisserie on London's Regents Street from July 2-4.
