Fox has pulled an episode of the adult cartoon 'Family Guy' that depicts mass deaths at the Boston Marathon. 

The episode, which first aired on March 17, was removed from Fox.com and Hulu.com and the network has no plans air it again, Fox spokeswoman Gaude Paez said Tuesday. 

The episode features the show's main character, Peter Griffin, unwittingly befriending a terrorist who is planning to blow up a bridge and then accidentally detonating two bombs using a cell phone the friend gave him. The sounds of screams follow the detonations.

Pulled: Fox will not re-air an episode of the adult cartoon 'Family Guy' that depicts mass deaths at the Boston Marathon

In a separate and unrelated scene, the episode depicts Griffin reminiscing about how he won a former Boston Marathon by mowing over runners in his car. 

'I'll tell ya, Bob, I just got in my car and drove it,' Griffin says. 'And when there was a guy in my way, I killed him.'

As he talks, he is illustrated driving his car across the finish line with a trail of bloody carnage behind him. 

Internet users mashed the clips together and suggested that the 'Family Guy' episode had either predicted or influenced the tragic explosions at the marathon on Monday that killed three people and injured 183.

The show's creator, Seth MacFarlane, said it is 'abhorrent' to suggest that the show predicted or influenced the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon on Monday

The show's creator, Seth MacFarlane, called the edited clips 'abhorrent.'

'The edited Family Guy clip currently circulating is abhorrent,' MacFarlane tweeted on Tuesday. 'The event was a crime and a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victims.'
