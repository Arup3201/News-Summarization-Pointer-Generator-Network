If you're the type to forget important dates but your other half isn't, it might be wise to invest in this piece of relationship-saving jewellery.

The Remember Ring is a nifty little gadget that resembles a normal ring from the outside, but inside uses Hot Spot technology to heat itself up... a handy 24 hours before your anniversary.

Every hour the piece of metal gets hotter and hotter for 10 seconds, continuing to warm until, at 120ºF, it becomes impossible to ignore, reminding you that a special day is around the corner.

Fitted with a battery-charged micro-chip clock that converts heat in your hand into electricity, manufacturers promise the ring is maintenance free and will never switch off.

'Using a micro thermopile, The Remember Ring converts the heat from your hand into electricity, keeping the battery charged and microchip clock running perpetually,' say makers Alaska Jewelry. 'Just specify your anniversary date when you order, and we'll program your ring for you. Set it and forget it-until your anniversary!'

The ring does, in theory, cost $760 (£497), have a lifelong warranty, and come in seven styles available in 14 carat white and yellow gold in men's sizes 10 to 13.

Sadly, it is still a concept product. So you'll have to actually remember those special dates for a little bit longer.

Maybe a diary?

Would you forget your wedding anniversary?
