The aerial pictures of the devastation that wrecked Queens and struck at the heart of the close-knit community of Breezy Point.

A disastrous combination of overwhelming waves, rapid winds and a resulting fire brought a neighborhood of homes to the ground.

The foundations of over one hundred homes are clearly visible, giving a grisly picture of the ferocity of the damage.

New York City fire crews fought neck-deep water and battering winds as they battled a raging inferno that reduced 111 homes to ash in a neighborhood that is home to hundreds of their fellow firefighters.

Devastation: The Breezy Point neighborhood, in New York, where more than 50 homes were burned to the ground

Gutted: More than 50 homes were burned to the ground at Breezy Point on Monday  night as a result of Sandy

Destruction: 111 homes in Breezy Point, Queens, were reduced to ash after an uncontrollable blaze spread across the neighbourhood

The massive blaze in Breezy Point, 
Queens, was sparked by a downed power line about 11pm on Monday and was 
not brought under control until daybreak on Tuesday.

Many of the residents refused to 
participate in the mandatory evacuation that Mayor Bloomberg ordered 
before the storm hit, claiming that they could handle whatever Hurricane
 Sandy had for them.

Their thinking was based on 
experience: the hype before Hurricane Irene caused only some flood 
damage, and when the area was hit with a freak tornado just months ago, 
it came out remarkably unscathed.

That wasn’t the case this time, however, as the area now looks like a deserted warzone.

Firefighters waded into rushing 
floodwaters and scaled walls to perform dramatic rescues of dozens of 
trapped residents of the neighborhood at the tip of the Rockaway 
peninsula.

The blaze claimed the home of Rep Bob Turner, a Republican who won the seat of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner last year. 

Conservative Party chairman Michael Long also lost his house.

But for many of the 190 firefighters who heroically waged combat against the fire and the bluster of Superstorm Sandy, the battle was personal.

The tight-knit Irish Catholic community of 5,000 is home to hundreds of firefighters.

During the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 70 current or former residents of the neighborhood were killed.

Dozens of them were Fire Department of New York rescuers, who were rushing into the World Trade Center moments after it was struck.

The storm battered the little peninsula of Rockaway that juts between the Atlantic Ocean and Jamaica Bay.

The entire area, which has 130,000 residents, was in the city’s mandatory evacuation zone, but hundreds decided to stay and weather the storm.

Sorrow: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured in Breezy Point, said the blaze 'looked like a forest fire out in the Midwest'

Floodwaters made the community inaccessible for fire crews for many hours.

Firefighter Michael Parrella told the New York Times that the area was ‘probably the most flooded part of the city.’

Tropical storm-force winds whipped the small blaze into a frenzy, and it engulfed house after house. Initial reports late on Monday said 25 homes were on fire. Then the toll rose to 50. Then 80.

The final estimate is 111 houses leveled, most of them reduced to smoldering ash.

‘It looked like a forest fire out in

were just devastating blowing from one building to the next one. We are 
hoping and praying that there was no loss of life in those fires.’

One firefighter was injured and two residents were hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.

Some
 took advantage of the chaos, with men arrested on burglary charges 
after they struck a Radio Shack in Rockaway Beach yesterday.

The six-alarm fire - a rating system indicating it is dangerously serious - was whipped into a frenzy by wild winds. 

‘The Rockaways are devastated,' wrote Twitter user @KevinNeafsey. 'I can't believe the place that I grew up in looks like this after today, it's so incredibly sad.'

Tracie Strahan tweeted: 'We're on a submerged, powerless street in the Rockaways. I can't imagine how hard it is for @FDNY New York Fire Department to get to fires in the area this AM.'

NYC Arecs (Amateur Radio Emergency Communications Service) said that police in the 100th Precinct station house in the area were trapped on the building’s second floor.

‘What we have seen here is absolutely devastating,’ said ABC News producer Jim DeBreuil.

At Rockaway Park, a crew of Fire Department of New York special operations firefighters found themselves stranded on the last dry ground in the neighborhood.

They took a small boat into the heart of the fire and carried 30 people to safety.
