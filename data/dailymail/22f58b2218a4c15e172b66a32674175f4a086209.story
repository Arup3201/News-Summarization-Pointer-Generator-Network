Scientists believe our galaxy could contain a staggering 60 billion planets that might be capable of supporting life.

Based on data from NASA's Kepler spacecraft, scientists had predicted there should be one Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of each red dwarf, the most common type of star.

But a group of researchers has now doubled that estimate after considering how cloud cover might help an alien planet support life.

Cloud cover is crucial for life, as clouds not only reflect sunlight to cool things off - they keep the planet warm enough to sustain life.

A new study by the University of Chicago and Northwestern University said that the Milky Way alone could contain 60 billion planets orbiting red dwarf stars that could support life.

It also suggests new ways for astronomers to test whether planets orbiting red dwarfs have cloud cover.

The researchers based their study, which appeared in Astrophysical Journal Letters, on rigorous computer simulations of cloud behaviour on alien planets.

This cloud behaviour dramatically expanded the estimated habitable zone of red dwarfs, which are much smaller and fainter than stars like the sun.

Dorian Abbot, assistant professor in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago, said: 'Clouds cause warming and they cause cooling on Earth.

'They reflect sunlight to cool things off and they absorb infrared radiation from the surface to make a greenhouse effect.

'That's part of what keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life.'

The planets believed capable of supporting life fall in habitable zones where they are the right temperature to be able to have liquid water on their surfaces - a requirement of life as we know it.

As red dwarf stars are slightly cooler and less bright than our sun, the planets are usually closer to their star.

Nicolas Cowan, another author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University, said: 'If you're orbiting around a low mass or dwarf star, you have to orbit about once a month or once every two months to receive the same amount of sunlight that we receive from the sun.'

As the orbit of these habitable planets around a red dwarf is tight, they are tidally locked, so that one side of the planet always faces the star.

Therefore anything living on one of these planets would enjoy continual daylight.

The researchers used 3D simulations to model how air would move over a planet tidally locked with a dwarf star. 

Mr Cowan said: 'There’s no way you can do clouds properly in one dimension.

'But in a three dimensional model, you’re actually simulating the way air moves and the way moisture moves through the entire atmosphere of the planet.'

They found that if water was found on the surface of a planet it would result in clouds.

These clouds would gather on the star-facing side of the planet where it is always noon.

Their position would have a cooling effect on the inner ring of the habitable zone, enabling the planets to have water on their surfaces, even though they are much closer to their red dwarfs than the Earth is to the sun.

Clouds exert a major influence on Earth's climate. If clouds only cooled the planet by reflecting solar energy back to space, Earth (pictured) would completely ice over. But if clouds only warmed the planet by absorbing and reemitting infrared energy back to the surface, Earth would fry under a runaway greenhouse effect like the one on Venus

The scientists believe that their findings could prove a new way to confirm the presence of liquid water on the surface of alien planets using the James Web Space Telescope.

The new space observatory is scheduled for launch in 2018.

Mr Cowan said: 'If you look at Brazil or Indonesia with an infrared telescope from space, it can look cold and that's because you're seeing the cloud deck'

He explained that the as the cloud deck is at high altitude it is extremely cold and the same could be true of a habitable planet with a highly reflective cloud cover.

The researchers said that if the telescope detects a similar cold signal over the star-facing side of an alien planet, it is 'almost definitely from clouds.'

'It's a confirmation that you do have surface liquid water.'
