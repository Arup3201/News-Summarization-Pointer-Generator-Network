Liverpool Chairman Tom Werner is confident Raheem Sterling will end his contract impasse and commit to a long-term deal.

Brendan Rodgers warned Sterling’s advisors earlier this week that Liverpool would not be held to ransom over their demands.

And Werner said in an interview with the Liverpool Echo: ‘All I can say is that I’m hopeful that we’ll conclude a deal. Obviously it’s important for us. He’s an exceptional player.

‘Brendan and Ian Ayre are quite involved and Brendan is talking to Raheem about this and I hope and expect a very positive outcome that is good for Raheem - and good for the club.

‘I would say that I’m confident that we will reach an agreement that works for all parties.’

The England international has yet to agree new terms after talks stalled for a number of months.

Sterling has just over two years left on his current deal and Liverpool manager Rodgers said on Monday he is confident that the issues will get finalised sooner rather than later.

'Raheem is going to get rewarded. He has been offered a wonderful deal, an incredible deal for a young player. He is very happy here and you can see that in his play,' Rodgers said. 

'We are certainly not going to be a club that gives out way, way above what they are worth. We reward our best players.

'It is very important for young players to have something to strive for and if they get too much too soon it will sabotage their development. Raheem has been outstanding since he was put in the team but you have to remember this was a 17-year-old who was put into the team.
