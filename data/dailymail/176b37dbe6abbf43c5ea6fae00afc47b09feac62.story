 

Billionaire oil bosses today joined the President of France in paying their last respects to Total boss Christophe de Margerie – as the investigation into his death in a plane crash uncovered mysterious new evidence. 

The 63-year-old chief executive died when his private plane crashed into a snow plough at Moscow's Vnukovo airport a week ago. 

President  Hollande joined numerous other dignitaries including  Tamim Ben Hamad Al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar and IMF managing director Christine Lagarde at the service at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris.

Russian ambassador Alexandre Orlov represented President Vladimir Putin, who said de Margerie had been a 'true friend' of his country before he died in a tragic accident. 

But a French investigator has now suggested that the snow clearing machine crossed the runway and then mysteriously reversed back into the jet's path. 

Before his death De Margerie worked closely with Russia and had plans to invest in Russian energy

Francois Hochart, who was sent to Moscow by France's BEA accident investigation bureau, told AFP news agency that the initial take-off was routine. 

'The pilots did a few checks and at that moment, the runway was clear,' said Mr Hochart. 'Fourteen seconds after the start of the acceleration, one of the pilots said: "What's that car crossing the runway?" '

Referring to the control tower, Mr Hochart said: 'We know that the snowplough crossed the runway without the tower's authorisation. 

'For a totally unknown reason, it reversed back onto the runway just as the plane arrived.' 

Such findings will heighten conspiracy theories around the crash, which is under criminal investigation.

There have been a number of arrests, including that of the 60-year-old snowplough driver, who was said to be drunk at the time. 

Vladimir Martynenko is said to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.6 grams of ethanol per litre of blood, compared to the legal limit of zero for driving in Russia, but he denies it. 

Instead, Martynenko said he had 'lost his bearings' and did not notice he was on the runway.   

Total, one of the world's largest hydrocarbon producers, is among France's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization and a major player of French international business.

Total recently named Patrick Pouyanne as the new chief executive, while former Total CEO, Thierry Desmarest, was appointed chairman.

During his time as CEO, De Margerie worked closely with Russia and had plans to invest in Russian energy. 

Hours before the crash, he met Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to discuss foreign investment in Russia.

Following the memorial service, De Margerie will be buried Tuesday morning in a small private ceremony in Normandy, northern France.
