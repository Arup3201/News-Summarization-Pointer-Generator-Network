A soldier gave his sister the surprise of a lifetime by showing up unannounced at her wedding.

Jessie Smith, 26, hadn’t seen her brother in several years before her brother Ryan Douglas surprised her by attending her June 29 wedding in Virginia. With Douglas is currently serving active duty in the US Army, Smith had resigned herself to the fact her brother would not be at the blessed event.

‘I was upset that he couldn’t make it but understood he had a career that he had obligations to,’ Smith told ABC News.

Surprise!: Soldier shows at sister's wedding, brings her to tears

Douglas knew weeks in advance that he would be able to attend the wedding, but intentionally kept it a secret from most of the family for fearing of letting the secret out, according to ABC.

When Douglas showed up in uniform it confused the photographer, who initially thought it might be Smith's soon-to-be husband. Nick Smith serves in the Coast Guard.

‘The photographer asked me, ‘Is Nick wearing his uniform?,’ because she saw someone wearing a uniform outside,” Smith told ABC. “I said no, and then wondered who was wearing their uniform. I peeked my head around and saw my brother and his wife and sister-in-law and freaked out.’

Smith cried tears of joy as she hugged her brother for the first time in what probably felt like an eternity, before hustling everyone out of the room to avoid her soon-to-husband.

‘I was ecstatic but also remembered we had to avoid Nick so I quickly ushered them all inside,’ Smith told ABC.

A exceptional day made even more so by a rare visit from her brother, Smith told ABC she could not have been happier.

‘I rarely get to see my brother as we are both busy working on our careers and education, and it was amazing to get to have him there for my special day.’
