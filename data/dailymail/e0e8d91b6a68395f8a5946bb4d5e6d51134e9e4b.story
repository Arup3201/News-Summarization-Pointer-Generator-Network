The lone survivor of a 1985 Reno airplane crash that killed 70 people who were returning from a Super Bowl junket says he can't bring himself to attend a memorial on the 30th anniversary of the disaster.

George Lamson Jr. was 17 when Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 crashed in a field in south Reno on January 21, 1985.

Rescuers responding to the fiery wreckage found him strapped in his seat in the middle of a street.

Then and now: Gregory Lamson Jr. (pictured recently at left and as a senior in high school at right) was the sole survivor of the Galaxy Airlines Flight 203 crash that killed 70--including Lamson's father--in 1985

Miraculous: Lamson was was discovered still strapped into his seat after the plane broke in half just in front of him and an explosion sent him flying behind a ball of fire into the middle of a street

'I don't want to be remembered as the boy who survived this accident. I want to be remembered as the man that lived,' Lamson, 47, told the Reno Gazette-Journal this week.

'Life is a gift for which I am always grateful for. Thank you to all that have helped me along in my journey.'

Washoe County officials plan to unveil a new memorial plaque on Wednesday after the original was stolen two years ago near the campus of the University of Nevada, Reno.

Though Minnesota native Lamson moved to Reno way back in 1990--to the place he spent the last unscarred day of his youth and last saw the father he so greatly admired--he says he can't bear to attend the memorial re-dedication.

But he said he recently visited the new memorial and was pleased with the plaque, which is embedded in a granite boulder and surrounded by pine trees that were planted in memory of the plane's passengers and crew. 

Lamson, his father, George Sr., and 64 other football fans from Minnesota had traveled on a charter flight from Minneapolis to Reno. 

Too emotional: A previous memorial plaque was stolen near the campus of the University of Nevada. The new was to be rededicated this week--without the only survivor in attendance

Moved near to his nightmare: Lamson would not attend the rededication despite living in the very city where it sits. The Minnesota native moved to the city where his life turned upside down--Reno, Nevada--in 1990, a decision he attributes in a documentary to the city making him feel closer to his dad

Some of the group went by bus to Stanford, California, to attend the Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and the Miami Dolphins. Others traveled to Lake Tahoe and watched the game at Caesars Tahoe.

The group reunited late Jan. 20, 1985 at then-Reno-Cannon International Airport. Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, a Lockheed Electra 4-engine turboprop, took off just after 1 a.m.

A minute after takeoff, the co-pilot notified the tower of a severe vibration and requested an immediate return. 

The plane crashed and broke in half just in front of the row where Lamson and his father were seated. A huge fireball followed, catapulting Lamson onto a street. 

His life would never be the same.

'I came from St. Paul, Minnesota,' he said. 'I grew up in a neighborhood where I was the paperboy. I was the kid that cut your grass, shoveled your sidewalk, the altar boy at Mass. I identified myself as the son of George Lamson Sr. I played hockey. I was a Boy Scout. I was an all-Minnesota kind of boy.' 

Lamson struggled to fit into society after the crash, for which he would receive a sizable settlement after the pilot was found to be at fault. Eventually, he would marry and have a daughter, Hannah

Lamson now works as a dealer at a Reno casino. The 47-year-old father appears in the CNN documentary Sole Survivor, which follows him and others who escaped death in major crashes that killed all their fellow passengers, which airs Thursday at 6pm

Like many in his unimaginable situation, Lamson would go on to suffer from survivor's guilt--much of it stemming from his feeling that others would judge him for the way he lived his life following his brush with death.

He told the Gazette-Journal earlier this month that for years he longed to share the story of his life after the crash. He got that opportunity in the form of a documentary called Sole Survivor.

The film follows Lamson and others in his position, including a young French girl and a pilot from Colorado.

'It was a wonderfully warm and enriching experience,' Lamson said of the first screening of the film. 'After the film was over, I got up to walk to the front of the theater and was given a long standing ovation.'

Sole Survivor makes its national premier on Thursday's 30th anniversary of the Galaxy crash at 6pm on CNN.

Seventy passengers and crew members perished when Galaxy Flight 203 went down and exploded shortly after takeoff from Reno-Cannon International Airport, since renamed Reno-Tahoe.

It was a charter flight operated by Galaxy Airlines.

'We saw it crash,' said Floyd Arterburn, who still lives with his wife, Jeanne, near the accident site. 'My boy and I ran out to South Virginia Street. Somebody was screaming out in the field.'

The plane crashed south of the airport runway in a field on the east side of South Virginia.

The pilot was trying to return to Reno-Cannon for an emergency landing after reporting a severe vibration, possibly caused by an open service-access door under one wing.

The National Transportation Safety Board report said the plane went down when the pilot, Allen Heasley, reacted to the vibration incorrectly by ordering an engine power reduction.
