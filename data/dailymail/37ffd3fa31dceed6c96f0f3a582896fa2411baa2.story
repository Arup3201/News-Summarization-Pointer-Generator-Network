Double Olympic gold medalist snowboarder Shaun White has been charged with public intoxication and vandalism after an incident at a Nashville hotel.

White tried to attack a hotel guest who had followed him out of the hotel early on Sunday morning, according to police.

When the guest told 26-year-old White he had called the police, the snowboarder 'attempted to attack the man and fell and hit his head'.

A police report said the champion snowboarder appeared to be drunk. A separate affidavit stated that White deliberately broke a phone belonging to the hotel.

Police said he was given the opportunity to sign misdemeanor citations and refused.

A spokeswoman for Baptist Hospital said White was treated there and released on Monday.

When he was confronted by staff during the incident, the 26-year-old supposedly set off several fire alarms before running off.

White was spotted at the 2012 London Olympic Games but he didn't participate.

Instead the sportsman did little to dispel reports that he is dating model Bar Refaeli as they attended a swimming event together.

The duo were sat behind Debbie Phelps and her daughters Hilary and Whitney as they watched Michael score his record 19th Olympic medal.

The pair were first linked after meeting at the Maxim magazine Hottest Woman In The World party in May.

San Diego native White, who is also a world-class skateboarder, was just 19 when he first won snowboarding gold at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He won gold again four years later in the halfpipe event at the Vancouver Games.

He has been a semi-professional sportsman since the age of seven after being backed by label Burton Snowboards. He has also been sponsored by Oakley Inc.,Birdhouse Skateboards and Red Bull.

The 26-year-old has his own range of successful video games. In 2009, Forbes magazine estimated that he had earned $9 million from his endorsements in 2008 alone.
