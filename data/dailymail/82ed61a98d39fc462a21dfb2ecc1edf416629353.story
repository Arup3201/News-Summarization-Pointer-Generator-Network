Hilary Mantel was given the powerful drug during a hospital stay

Author Hilary Mantel claims to have found inspiration for her forthcoming book of short stories about Margaret Thatcher while high on morphine.

The double Booker prize winner admitted she had hallucinations while in hospital during which a key character in her book The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher appeared to her.

Miss Mantel had been receiving treatment for the womb condition endometriosis when she was given morphine as a painkiller.

‘That story I started years and years ago and I could not get it right,’ she said.

‘The first night I was in hospital full of morphine I simply stayed up all night making up stories. And one of the things that happened was that I saw the assassin. I knew exactly who he was. So the missing piece of that story dropped into place.

‘I made up some other stories too. It wasn’t me going temporarily mad; it was a drug-induced thing. But as a writer you try and use everything.’

The author, 61, told The Observer that, despite the experience, she had not been tempted to dabble with drugs to fuel her writing since.

‘It was a one-off,’ she said. ‘For every profitable idea, I think, ten are going to be garbage. My problem is never ideas. My problem is time.’

The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher features ten stories about the late prime minister in ‘contemporary settings’ and is due to be published later this year.

Her publisher, Nicholas Pearson of 4th Estate, has said the collection shows ‘the country we have become’. Miss Mantel is best known for her historical novels Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies. She won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction for both, making her the first woman and first British author to have won the award twice.

She has attracted controversy in the past after claiming that the Duchess of Cambridge was being portrayed as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ whose only purpose was to breed.

During a lecture at the British Museum, Miss Mantel criticised Kate for appearing to have been ‘gloss-varnished’ with a perfect plastic smile in contrast to the late Princess of Wales, who she described as awkward and emotionally incontinent.

She went on to suggest that the ‘painfully thin’ Duchess was selected for her role of princess because she posed no risk of showing any character.
