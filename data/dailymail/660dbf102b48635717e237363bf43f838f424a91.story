Nick Fairley has signed for the St Louis Rams on a one-year, prove yourself deal.

When fit and focused, Fairley is one of the NFL's better defensive linemen, but his career has been plagued with concerns about injuries, attitude and his weight.

Worth $5million, but with the incentive to make up to $7.5m according to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport, the defensive tackle joins arguably the most fearsome front four in football.

The 27-year-old will likely slot in alongside either Defensive Rookie of the Year Aaron Donald or Michael Brockers to aid the Rams' frightening pass rush.

With defensive ends Chris Long and Robert Quinn, quarterbacks facing the Rams next season - who include Matthew Stafford - will seldom get a moment's peace.  

Fairley, the 13th overall pick of the 2011 draft, spent the first four years of his career in Detroit, playing 46 games.which yielded 98 tackles, 13.5 sacks, four forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries.

But the Lions declined to take up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract and did not exactly bend over backwards to retain his services. A history of inconsistency, injuries and off-field concerns led the Lions to allow him enter free agency.

Coach Jeff Fisher made the announcement at a press conference to unveil new quarterback Nick Foles. 

Fairley injured his knee in the 22-21 win over the Atlanta Falcons at Wembley last year, which ended his season. 

Following the departure of fellow defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, the Lions have brought in Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker.
