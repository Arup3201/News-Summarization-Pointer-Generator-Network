A mother claimed today that her three year-old son was left with burns and bruises when a new £3 football exploded on his lap.

Nikki Thomas, 28, bought ‘two for £6’ balls from a Sports Direct store in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, for Codey and his four-year-old brother Tod.

Her partner Tom Winn asked a member of staff to inflate them both before they left the store - but when they got in the car, Miss Thomas claims one of them ‘spontaneously exploded’ as Codey held it.

Miss Thomas, of Berryfields, 
Buckinghamshire, said the youngster suffered friction burns on his legs 
and bruising and claims the explosion was so big it even damaged her 
car’s speakers.

She said: 
‘They were selling the balls at two for £6 so we bought them and my 
partner took them to the counter and a member of staff put air into 
them.

‘When we had paid we got into the car and as we were driving into a supermarket car park to pull up we heard a huge bang.

‘We
 stopped the car and I got out and when I opened the back door I saw 
that the football had literally split into two while it was on Codey’s 
lap.

‘He was in tears and he
 had bruises and burns on his leg. It’s so lucky that it wasn’t his 
face. I then took the football off Tod because it looked as though it 
was splitting at the seams as well.’

Miss Thomas and builder Mr Winn, 30, returned to the store to complain and were given an apology and their money back.

Miss Thomas, who lives in a £240,000 house and also has 15 week-old son Ronnie, made a second trip later when she discovered her car speakers had also been damaged.

She added: ‘We then got into the car to drive home and after my partner decided to put some music on we heard crackling from the speaker.

‘We had a look and because Codey’s leg was next to the speaker at the time the ball exploded it had burst the speaker as well, all the inside lining of it had been ripped.

‘I went back because I wanted to make it really clear that it wasn’t just a little thing, it had really hurt my son. We were told staff are supposed to undertake training to inflate the balls.

'He was in tears and he had bruises and burns on his leg. It’s so lucky that it wasn’t his face'

Nikki Thomas

‘I don’t know if it was down to the member of staff over-inflating the ball or whether they were just really poor quality balls, I think it was probably a combination of both.

‘Codey usually sits next to our newborn son, Ronnie, so we are lucky that wasn’t the case this time. I also dread to think what could have happened if the ball had exploded in Ronnie or Codey’s face.’

A Sports Direct spokesman said today: 'Sports Direct is aware of the incident and is investigating.'
