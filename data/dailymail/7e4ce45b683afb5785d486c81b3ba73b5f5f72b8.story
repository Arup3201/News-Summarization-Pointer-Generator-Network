Business leaders have accused Labour of seeking to burden firms after the party announced plans to make it easier for employers to be sued.

Last year the Coalition introduced moves to tackle frivolous employment tribunal cases by making claimants pay an up-front fee.

But yesterday Labour’s rising star, Chuka Umunna, told the Trades Union Congress conference that he wanted to scrap the fees for many people by introducing a means test.

Fighting cases at employment tribunals currently costs firms an average of £8,500.

Since the £1,200 fee was introduced, employment tribunal cases have dropped by three-quarters – with sex discrimination cases dropping by 80 per cent and race claims down 60 per cent.

Under the current system, any employee who wins their case will be reimbursed. And low-income workers or people who claim certain benefits can apply to have their fee waived.

The fee can also be lifted if it would prevent the claimant from paying an overdue rent or mortgage payment, if they are threatened with legal action over unpaid bills, or if they are faced with uninsured losses due to fire, flood, theft or criminal damage.

The fee has been credited with almost destroying the multi-billion pound industry based on vexatious discrimination claims against employers.

But Mr Umunna, Labour’s business spokesman, revealed that he is planning to reform the tribunals system.

He made his announcement just hours after the TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady demanded that the tribunal fees be scrapped, fuelling concerns that Labour is in thrall to the unions.

Miss O’Grady said: ‘If your boss robs you of holiday pay, why on earth should you have to find more than £1,000 to see justice done in an employment tribunal? It’s plain wrong that workers are priced out of justice. So – and let’s demand it – we want employment tribunal fees scrapped, once and for all.’

Only hours later, addressing the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool, Mr Umunna said he wanted to introduce a means test, claiming that the Tories’ system is preventing the poorest employees from upholding their rights in the workplace.

He said: ‘We have fought to defend people’s rights and voice in opposition but these rights are only meaningful if you can get proper redress.

‘The current tribunal system is unfair, unsustainable and has resulted in prohibitive costs locking people out of the justice they are entitled to.

‘Affordability should not be a barrier to workplace justice. So if we are elected, the next Labour Government will abolish the current system, reform the employment tribunals and put in place a new system which ensures all workers have proper access to justice.’

But James Sproule, director of policy at the Institute of Directors, criticised the plans, saying: ‘Claimants on benefits or low incomes are exempt so we don’t think the fees are a barrier to wronged employees getting compensation.’

He added: ‘Before refundable charges were introduced, fewer than one in ten tribunal cases against IoD members were won by the claimant, wasting large amounts of money and time for businesses. Fees are a sensible way to weed out weak or vexatious claims.’

And Neil Carberry, from the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘Firms have been frustrated for years by false and misleading claims that take up time and resources.

‘Recent reforms which encourage early resolution of disputes are a step in the right direction, and fees to make a claim are a vital part of that.’

Last night Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Of course we want to make sure everyone can get justice in the workplace. That’s precisely why we’re giving waivers to people who can’t afford to pay employment tribunal fees.’

He added: ‘These proposals would undermine our record jobs recovery and make it harder for employers to create jobs. Labour just haven’t learned their lesson.’
