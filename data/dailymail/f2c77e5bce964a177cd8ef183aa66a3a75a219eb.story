Australia's drug addiction has reached a new high as recent figures revealed that the use of illicit substances are more extensive than other nations around the world.

Shocking statistics were released by the United Nation's 2014 World Drug Report, detailing that Australia ranked the highest ecstasy-users in the world, followed by fourth place for cocaine and then seventth for cannabis.

The report also showed Australia's disturbing rise in demand for prescribed pain opioids such as codeine and morphine, ranking second after the U.S.

But while Australia tops the world in ecstasy consumption, data suggests that usage has been reduced.

'In Australia, expert opinion points to an increase in the consumption of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, and solvents and inhalants, but a decline in the use of "ecstasy",' the report said.

'There is a wide range of drug analogues and new psychoactive substances that are currently available in the Australian illicit drug market.'

The declining availability of heroin in Australia has consequently increased the abuse of prescription opioids, including so-called 'hillbilly heroin', the report suggests.

It stated that high-income countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States have a high consumption of opioids for medical purposes.

Australians are the 7th highest cannabis users in the world

'In 2001, the heroin market in Australia underwent a supply drop and a consequent change in consumption patterns, in which most indicators of heroin use declined and some consumers resorted to prescription opioids as a substitute,' the report said.

In particular, use of oxycodone increased significantly, displacing morphine in some cases.

'A comparison of price data for heroin and oxycodone in Queensland, Australia, in 2011 and 2012 shows that a tablet containing 60 mg of oxycodone cost $20-30, while an equivalent amount of heroin at retail prices would have cost $40-50.'

Cocaine use remained stable over 2012 with an estimated number of 14 million to 21 millionÂ  past-year users globally.

However the report suggested that the increasing availability of the drug in Europe could possibly be driven by an increasing supply originating from Peru.

Such supplies, which are destined for Europe, could be entering the emerging Australian market which has expanded in recent years while prices are higher than western and central Europe.

'Past-year use of cocaine among the general population aged 14 years or older in Australia rose from 1.6 per cent in 2007 to 2.1 per cent in 2010, although the average frequency of consumption appears to be low possibly due to high prices,' the report said.

The manufacture of methamphetamine in North America expanded once again with a dramatic increase in the number of dismantled methamphetamine laboratories reported in the United States and Mexico.

These two countries along with China, Thailand and Iran continue to report the highest amounts of methamphetamine seized worldwide while the report also suggested that there's a growing demand in south-east Asia.

Topping cocaine usage is Scotland while Iceland came placed first for cannabis.
