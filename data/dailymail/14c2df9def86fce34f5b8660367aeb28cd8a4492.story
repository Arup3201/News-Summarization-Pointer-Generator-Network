They were voted the biggest fashion faux pas of last year, but 'meggings' - that's male leggings - could become a male wardrobe staple this season.

Two British designers have unveiled a range of meggings, which they hope will enable men to 'both look great and feel comfortable in leggings.'

Luke Shipley and Tom Hunt established sTitch Leggings in 2012 after they were forced to wear 'ill-fitting female leggings' to a themed party.

New trend? Meggings, male leggings made from lycra, could become a seasonal staple thanks to two designers who are trying to make them mainstream

This embarrassing fashion faux pas inspired the duo to join forces with friend Joe Hollingworth and set about designing a legging range just for men.

Priced at £25, sTitch leggings are inspired by celebrities such as Russel Brand and Justin Bieber, who both favour meggings.

They come in an array of colourful designs such as rainbow-coloured diamonds and hot pink - and even come complete with back pockets for your valuables.

Writing on their website, the team say: 'We envision a day where men can wear what they want as opposed to what they should, to achieve this, we will strive to design and produce garments that liberate the modern man from conventional male fashion.

'We grew up wearing, doing and saying what we wanted. We believe this is how life should be lived.

'We have therefore made it our goal to expand this way of life and have built sTitch Leggings as a vehicle to do so.'

Speaking to the Express, they added: 'Meggings are the natural evolution from the skinny jean and the once widespread baggy jean.

'Everyone knows leggings are an incredibly comfortable and stylish garment - why should women have all the fun?

'From Henry VIII to David Bowie, style icons through the centuries have accepted them as an essential garment in their wardrobe. As the 21st century man becomes both more metrosexual and well-groomed, the once well-defined gender fashion barrier is slowly eroding.'
