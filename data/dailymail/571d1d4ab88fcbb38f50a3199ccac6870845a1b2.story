Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is hoping to spring a surprise during the remaining days of the summer transfer window.

Reports from Italy suggest the Black Cats have signed Inter Milan's Argentina international winger Ricky Alvarez on a season-long loan deal, although sources on Wearside were insisting on Thursday morning that was not the case.

However, Alvarez is very much on the radar as Poyet attempts to put the finishing touches to his summer rebuilding programme.

Frustrated: Poyet hopeful of surprise signings after spending most of his summer attempting to sign Fabio Borini from Liverpool 

He has given little away about the men who remain in his sights, but told the Sunderland Echo: 'We're moving, we're moving very fast because it's getting close. I'm confident we'll be doing something.

'You're going to be surprised.'

Sunderland have spent much of the summer attempting to lure Liverpool's Fabio Borini back to the Stadium of Light after his successful loan spell last season.

Defensive support: Sunderland have also been linked with Celtic's centre back Virgil van Dijk

However, an increasingly frustrated Poyet indicated at the weekend that he would have to turn his attention elsewhere if he did not get a positive answer soon.

Indeed, the club has also expressed an interest in Lille's former Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou as a potential alternative.

The left-hand side of midfield remains a major focus, as does central defence, where the Black Cats have been linked with Celtic's Virgil van Dijk in recent days.
