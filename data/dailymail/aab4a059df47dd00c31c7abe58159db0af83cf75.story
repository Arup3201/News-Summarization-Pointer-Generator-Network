An alcoholic who brutally murdered a grandmother by stabbing her repeatedly in the face with a pitchfork while she lay sleeping in her bed has been jailed for life.

Anthony Hall, 48, wanted to steal 57-year-old Rhoda Youson's bank card so he could withdraw cash for a takeaway.

A court heard the grandmother-of-seven had her face 'caved in' by Hall as he bludgeoned her with a wooden bat and stabbed her again and again with the fork.

Murderer: Anthony Hall, left, left Rhoda Youson, 57, so disfigured that her face was unrecognisable after he battered her with a wooden bat and stabbed her in the face with a pitchfork

The attack left her so disfigured that her facial features were unrecognisable.

Hall was one of a number of homeless people for whom Mrs Youson would cook dinners in her home in Coventry, West Midlands.

Two days after the attack, Hall bragged to a friend - who reported him to the police - about 'bashing someone with a pitchfork'.

Hall was later arrested and officers forced their way into Mrs Youson’s flat in Coventry, West Midlands.

They discovered her lifeless body in bed on November 22 last year.

The pitchfork was later found tossed aside in a car park along with a carrier bag containing the broken bat.

She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls.

Hall went on trial accused of her murder which he denied on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was found guilty by a jury in July.

Passing sentence today Judge Patrick Thomas said Hall meted out gross violence to his victim and showed 'a complete willingness to destroy a life'.

He said: 'The reality of this case is that the lady whom you killed was small, frail and ill.

'She
was a lady who demonstrated to the end of her days - to others but also
to you - levels of generosity and care that are apparent to all.

'I am satisfied that the motive for this was your desire to have her bank card so that you could use it, as you did.'

During the trial prosecutor Philip Bennetts told the court Mrs Youson was attacked after she took pity on a group of ‘street drinkers’ for whom she often cooked meals for at her home.

He said: 'The following day Hall told several people that he had done something bad.

'He mentioned to a customer at a betting shop that he had killed someone and told a friend that he had killed Rhoda and had caved her face in.

'Generous': Mrs Youson invited Hall to her house to cook for him and gave him and other homeless people money

'She became friendly with street drinkers - she was generous with money for homeless people she met.

'Hall was one of those people who she used to invite to her home and cook meals.

'She had massive injuries to her head and there was nothing left of her facial area. Blood was splattered on the walls.'

After the case, Mrs Youson's family said a statement through Warwickshire Police: 'Rhoda Youson had a heart of gold and would always help others without being asked.

'She was kind and generous to her friends offering support, food, shelter, shower and clean clothes when needed just as Anthony Hall knew after she walked him to hospital despite not being in the best of health herself.

'Words alone can not describe how we are feeling or how we’ve managed to function on a daily basis, and we would never, ever want any other family to go through what we have gone through over the last nine months.

'She is greatly missed by her daughters and grandchildren, her sisters, mother and friends.'
