The outlook is sunny for an experimental solar aircraft set to circumnavigate the globe next year, after it has successfully made its maiden flight.

The Solar Impulse 2 HB-SIB took off from Payerne airbase in Switzerland today and successfully soared above the clouds for more than an hour before landing safely.

The solar-powered plane has no fuel on board and with a wingspan of 236ft (72 metres), it is larger than a Boeing 747-8I jet liner. It weighs around the same as a car at 382 stone (2,300kg).

The revolutionary single-seater aircraft is made of carbon fibre.

It has a 236ft (72 metre) wingspan - larger than that of the Boeing 747-8I.

But it weighs just 2,300kg - equivalent to a car.

The 17,000 solar cells built into the wings supply four electric motors (17.5 CV each) with renewable energy.

During the day, the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing  2,077lbs (633 Kg) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy.

No fuel is carried aboard the aircraft.

It is set to become the first solar-powered plane to fly around the world thanks to its vast wings covered in 17,000 solar cells, which supply four electric motors.

German test pilot Markus Scherdel flew the cutting-edge machine, which is the second solar plane in the Solar Impulse Project. He also flew the first prototype aircraft in 2009.

Writing in a blog on the Solar Impulse website, the team said: ‘It is a great moment for everyone who has built this revolutionary solar airplane…

'All of this hard work to reach next year our ultimate goal: the attempt of the first round-the-world solar flight... only powered by solar energy’.

The solar aircraft of Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg is a single-seater and was flown for over one hour ‘in line with calculations and simulations,’ Solar Impulse said.

Pilots Bertrand Piccard and André  Borschberg will take turns in the single-seater cockpit of the Solar Impulse 2 plane.

Their five month mission is set to begin in March 2015 and last for five months.

The plane is completely solar-powered with no fuel on-board.

They will make a 22,000mile (35,000km) journey over approximately 500 flying hours.

There will be 10 legs, some of which will last for more than five days and nights.

A team of 60 people will support them.

The two co-founders of the project will pilot the plane themselves for a record-breaking attempt in 2015.

Before then, there will be several other flights taking place in the coming months so that the plane can be obtain certification.

Mr Borschberg, co-founder, pilot and CEO of Solar Impulse, said: ‘This inaugural flight is an important stage - a step closer towards the round-the-world flight.

‘It is also
 a huge emotional step for the entire team and all our partners who have
 worked on the aircraft. Si2 incorporates a vast amount of new 
technology to render it more efficient, reliable and in particular 
better adapted to long haul flights. It is the first aircraft which will
 have almost unlimited endurance.'

Mr Piccard, founder, president and pilot, said: ‘Throughout such an 
innovative project, each stage is a leap into the unknown. Today 
suspense was at a high!

‘The results show that our team of engineers can be very proud of the work it has accomplished during the last 10 years.’
