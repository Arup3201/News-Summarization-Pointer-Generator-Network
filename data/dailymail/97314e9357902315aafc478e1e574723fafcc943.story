Origi seems keen too, having revealed it is his dream to one day feature in the Premier League.

But the youngster is keeping grounded while in Brazil and will not decide on his future yet.

'As a little boy I always dreamed of playing in the Premier League,' said Origi, as reported by the Express.

'But I'm still young and now I'm in an important tournament so I'm trying to focus on the team. Then my entourage will see with Lille what I will do.'
