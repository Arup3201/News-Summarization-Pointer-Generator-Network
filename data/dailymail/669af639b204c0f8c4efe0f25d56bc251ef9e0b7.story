Furious parents have attacked a school's 'ridiculous' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges.

Students at The Grange School, in Runcorn, Cheshire, were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the Marie Curie cancer charity.

Head Barry Carney defended the decision, saying the school selected one charity to support each year and couldn't be seen to prefer one cause over another, but parents branded it 'pathetic'.

Student Lily Gaynor, 16, said that up to 70 students from The Grange School, Cheshire, had been taken out of lessons ahead of their GCSEs for refusing to remove the charity pins

Pupil Lily Gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student's plight by calling them from isolation. She estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes. 

The 16-year-old said: 'We have been taken out of lessons before our GCSEs because we won’t take off our charity badges.

'We’ve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they’re saying it isn’t part of school uniform and it’s singling out some charities over others.

'We’ve been here about an hour. They’re planning on keeping us here all day. It jeopardises our learning and we’ve got exams soon.'

Corinne Versleys, whose daughter Caitlin Mulchrane is among those in isolation, said: 'The school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers.

'I think it’s absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower.

'The majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they’re being told to remove them. I think it’s absolutely pathetic.'

The Marie Curie daffodil appeal has been running every March since 1986. Supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear.

Support: Pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the Marie Curie cancer charity during March as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised £8.26million

Last year the campaign, which is supported by the likes of actors Olivia Coleman and Dominic West, helped to raise £8.26 million, funding 413,000 hours of nursing care.

Despite criticism, Barry Carney, the head of Grange School, said he was simply applying the school's uniform policy, which was available online 'for all to see'.

He told the Liverpool Echo: 'Each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl’s charity. This year it happens to be the Teenage Cancer Trust.

'A number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school, which are pretty clear.

'When we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support.'

He said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity, rather than wearing a ribbon or badge.

He added that the school holds plenty of charity events, and has raised £1,000 for the Teenage Cancer Charity in the past year, with an open door cafe planned next Thursday.

He said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year.
