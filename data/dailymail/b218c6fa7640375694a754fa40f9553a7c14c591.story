Barry McGuigan would like to point out that Carl Frampton, the heir apparent to his own Irish legend, would be only too happy to accommodate Scott Quigg, who has just defended the ‘regular’ WBA world super-bantamweight title with a quick-fire KO.

However, McGuigan makes it clear that there would be more chance of that Battle of Britain happening if Quigg’s promoter Eddie Hearn would ‘stop posturing on the internet and engage in proper discussion.’

Hearn expressed being ‘keen to make Quigg-Frampton’ in his most recent MailOnline column but McGuigan says: ‘Eddie has not responded to our invitation to take part in meaningful talks.

‘He keeps twittering that he wants this fight for Quigg but the social media is no way to conduct serious negotiations. Certainly not for us.

‘Eddie did make one early offer to us but it was derisory. I invited him to meet with us immediately for sensible talks but he said he had to go abroad for another fight. So I suggested an appointment the following week... but he never came back to us.

‘Since then he’s kept saying in public how eager he is  to do this fight but we’ve still heard nothing from him. We would be delighted to get it on but do they really, really want it? I doubt it. 

‘Quigg’s a good fighter but Carl is special and I believe he would knock him out. I suspect Eddie thinks so, too.’

Both boxers impressed in their most recent fights, each with second round stoppages.First, in a rocking Belfast, Frampton took out Mexico’s former two-time world champion Hugo Cazares in a final eliminator for the WBC world title.

Then, on Saturday in Manchester, Quigg made his statement by halting African challenger Tshifiwa Munyai. Unless they can be brought into the same ring, each will move on to alternative championship fights.

McGuigan is in talks with WBC belt-holder Leo Santo Cruz, who has declared himself willing to come to Belfast for a big-money stadium defence against Frampton later this summer.

Hearn is eyeing a unification fight for Quigg with Kiko Martinez, who has been soundly beaten by Frampton but has come back to lift the IBF title. Hearn hints, also, that he is holding his own talks with Santa Cruz.

The British public are already hungry for Frampton v Quigg  but it would appear that boxing politics are again at work here.

There is no mention of Quigg making the logicial step up to meet full WBA champion Guillermo Rigondeaux, nor of Frampton taking that route.

In all honesty that is probably a wise precaution on the part of both Brits.

Cuba’s former two-time Olympic gold medallist was one of the greatest amateurs of all time is now in a brilliant class of his own in the professional super-bantam division. He, too, has offered to make the trip to Belfast but it would be foolish for either Frampton or Quigg to take on Rigondeaux at this stage of their development.

And while Quigg-Frampton is potentially a big-money match at the moment, it will be even hotter box office if the meeting waits until they both hold world titles.

Not that the great McGuigan ever ducked or delayed fighting anyone on his way to the pinnacle. And he says: ‘I never want to be drawn into the politics or arguments like these. But in this case I find myself having to make the case for Carl.

‘We are 
caught up in the cross-fire of rivalry between two television networks, 
BoxNation where Carl is appearing, and Sky, with whom Eddie has an 
exclusive deal and who don’t want Quigg to fight on another channel.

‘But I have to make it known that Carl will gladly fight Quigg if they are willing to do it.’

Boxing politics: A number of obstacles need to be overcome if Quigg is to fight Frampton, like TV channels

It also has to be said that while both are exciting prospects, the quality of their latest victims left something to be desired.

Cazares baled out after his first taste of Frampton’s power, staying down on one knee and then claiming he had misunderstood the ten count.

Munyai was a very late replacement against Quigg, struggled as a consequence to make the weight and appeared drained and weak as soon he took a heavy shot.

Of the two of them Frampton, who has yet to win an alpha-belt, looks more mature than Quigg at this point in their careers.

Bernard Hopkins continues to defy all-comers, Father Time included.

Already, at 49, the oldest boxer to win a recognised world championship, he has now became the longest in the tooth to unify two titles.

He did so on Saturday by not only outclassing Kazakhstan’s Beibut Shumenov in Washington but decking, in the process, a challenger 19 years his junior. Thus he added the WBA light-heavyweight title to his IBF belt.

So on to 50. His birthday is in January, when he will become eligible for senior citizen benefits in America. Expect him to fill in the gap by fighting, and probably defeating, Jean Pascal in Canada.

Even if he does not make it to his half century still wearing the belts, his place in the pantheon as the ring’s oldest champion will surely never be challenged.

George Foreman won the world heavyweight championship by knocking out Michael Moorer at 45 but relinquished the title a year later. 

And while Big George looked as if he was scoffing several times a day from one of his famous barbecues, Hopkins diets and trains to stay at or near his fighting weight at all times.

Way back when: Hopkins hits Keith Holmes  at Madison Square Garden in 2001

Dust off: The Executioner beat Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2004

He still looks every inch – in his case a young man’s 31in around the waits - the modern professional boxer. This man, who enters the ring wearing the mask of an alien, really is a freak of nature.

But he protects his human health by the clever way he fights, saying: ‘Boxing is a science.  If you don’t have to get hit, don’t. You don’t want to end up having to get someone else to count your money.’

It is 26 years since Hopkins lost his first professional bout and 20 years since he won his first world title, the IBF middleweight crown, by defeating Segundo Mercado at extreme and for him unfamiliar altitude in the Ecuador capital of Quito.

He is the champion of bus-pass holders the world over and he adds: ‘I’m making history every day.’

Long may he continue to do so.

Kell Brook’s long-awaited world title shot appears to be nearing but Sheffield’s finest could be forgiven for wishing that the fight between two Americans which has led to that opportunity had ended in a different result.

Next in line: Kell Brook is awaiting a world title shot

Paulie Malignaggi – a loser previously to Ricky Hatton and Amir Khan – might well have been a manageable opponent for Brook but he was blown away in four brutal rounds by IBF welterweight champion Shawn Porter and ended Saturday night in a New York hospital.

New York favourite Malignaggi, 34, recovered to say: ‘If this is it for me I want it to be known that I went out to a great champion.’

Brook is now Porter’s mandatory challenger and the fight is supposed to take place in July.

If, as expected, the champion is granted a recovery-time extension of an extra twp or three months Brook should not be too concerned.

He will need to be at his absolute best against Porter, who packs middleweight punching power, and every minute of preparation time will be precious.

Ricky Hatton’s hot prospect Adam Etches continues his unusual route to the top in the Hitman’s show in Sheffield on Saturday night.

Etches fights for his third world youth title against Mexican Felipe Teniente at the Ponds Forge Arena.Already the holder of two IBF championships at this level, he goes now for the WBC Youth middleweight crown.

For the moment, the traditional progress to a British title is on hold.

Etches says: ‘A lot of people are asking me when I’ll be fighting for a Londsdale Belt but these fights are getting me up the ratings with the world bodies.’

However, he is expected to meet Chris Eubank Jnr or John Ryder later this year.

Lucas ‘Big Daddy’ Browne tops Saturday’s bill in his clash with Canada’s Erik Bahoeli for the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title.

*Browne-Bahoeli and Etches-Tenient are live Saturday night on BoxNation.

It is the end of the road for boxing bin-man Rendall Munroe following the loss of his commonwealth featherweight title to young Josh Warrington.

Munroe, 34 in June, was in tears as he retired on his stool at the end of the sixth round in Manchester on Saturday night.

Once the emotions are back under control he can reflect on his admirable contribution to this hard old game, climaxed in 2010 by taking Japan’s brilliant Toshiaki Nishioka the distance in Tokyo in his one world featherweight title shot.

Munroe is one of the best-loved of British champions and it was fun for me to join him and his work-mates on an early-morning rubbish collection round in Leicester shortly before he flew to Japan.Thanks for the memories.
