You'd never know it with his clothes on, but 22-year-old blogger Matt Diaz is carrying around sizable rolls of excess skin underneath his shirt, and he's finally ready to reveal it to his fans.

Mr Diaz, from Brooklyn, New York, has lost an impressive 270lbs from his nearly-500lb frame since the age of 16 - a journey he's documented on his Tumblr blog, My Annoyances - but he has 'never' shown his excess skin before, and says he can no longer 'preach' about body positivity while continuing to hide his own flaws.

So, in an emotional video he shared on Tuesday, Mr Diaz removed his shirt and stated: 'I'm really scared to put this up. But I think it's important for me to share this with you guys, because this is who I am.' 

Laid bare: Blogger Matt Diaz, 22, revealed his excess skin in an emotional video he made for his fans this week, saying he could no longer 'preach' about body positivity and continue to hide his own flaws

Mr Diaz, who is on the verge of tears throughout the five-minute video, says he suffered 'an anxiety attack' before going ahead with the big reveal.

'I have stretch marks, I have birth marks, I have all this excess skin,' he says as he shifts from side to side and showcases his folds of skin.

'I'm scared people won't find me attractive anymore. I'm scared that all the nice messages will stop.'

On the contrary, Mr Diaz was amazed to receive nothing but support from his fans and followers.

'You are gorgeous Matt, I would date you,' wrote one user.

'This is hands down the bravest thing I’ve ever seen,' commented another.

Mr Diaz, who describes himself as a 'writer, comedian [and] all-around f*** up', states in the video: 'I want to be proud of who I am, and I want all of you to be proud of who you are, and part of that is not hiding it.'

Despite working out 'hard' and following a healthy diet plan, Mr Diaz knew that the only way he would be able to get rid of his excess skin would be with surgery. 

With that in mind, he set up a GoFundMe campaign on Wednesday to raise the $20,000 he needs for the procedure, and already, donations have reached $32,000.

Asked by Upworthy to offer advice to anyone struggling to come to terms with their own body-related insecurities, he said: 'I want you to remember that you are not the problem, certain aspects of society are the problem.'

He continued: 'Luckily, we're slowly starting to see these ideas get phased out by modernity.

'Plus-sized, un-retouched models are getting more attention in major brands... it's becoming clear that these negative ideas are not going to last, though it's going to take a while.'

Yesterday, Mr Diaz uploaded another (clothed) video to thank people for their donations.

'You have shown me so much kindness and now I have so much more faith in people,' he said, promising to document the skin-removal surgery with his fans when he undergoes it.
