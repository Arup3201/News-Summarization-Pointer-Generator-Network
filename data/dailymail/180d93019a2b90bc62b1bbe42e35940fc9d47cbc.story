Passengers flying from Brussels to Stockholm were shocked when airline bosses refused to return their luggage - after it was found to be infested with maggots.

The surprised travellers were told that their baggage would be flown back to Brussels, to be either sanitised or destroyed.

One passenger on board, 60-year-old 
journalist Willy Silberstein, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet: 'When 
they opened the baggage area, 
maggots spilled out.'

'In these times of ebola, it's understandable that they have to be careful,' he said.

'But it's certainly unusual.'

Brussels Airlines reported that the 
infestation was due to a passenger packing expired food in their suitcase.

Spokesman for the airline, Geert Sciot, said: 'I can confirm that we have 
had sanitation problems with a passenger's baggage, which apparently 
contained food which was expired and rotten.'

'It was transfer baggage from another continent.'

The airline also confirmed that the infested bag had been destroyed.

And the remaining bags had been flown back to Brusels to be sanitised, before being returned to passengers in Stockholm.
