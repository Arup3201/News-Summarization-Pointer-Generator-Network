American Lindsey Vonn equaled Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 women's Alpine skiing World Cup victories when she won a downhill race in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Sunday.

The four times World Cup overall winner and 2010 Olympic champion, who returned to action this season after a year out due to knee operations, can now break the record in Monday's Super-G at the same Italian resort.

Vonn, 30, also celebrated her 32nd downhill win -- four fewer than Moser-Proell who set her record between 1970 and 1980.

However, only four disciplines were on the World Cup programme during the great Austrian's era, with the Super-G not introduced until the 1983 season.

"It's been a long way to get to where I am now. If I look back on my career, I can hardly believe I won that much," said Vonn.

"I could never have imagined I would go that far and that high," she added.

Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark holds the men's all-time record of World Cup wins with 86 between 1975 and 1989.

 It was no easy task for Vonn, who was only 10th in a shortened downhill held in Cortina on Friday after being rescheduled from the Austrian resort of Bad Kleinkirchheim.

The regular Cortina downhill, which Vonn has won three times in the past, had been postponed from Saturday to Sunday due to snowfalls.

Vonn used her peerless technical skills and experience of the piste to win the third downhill of her comeback season in one minute and 39.61 seconds in front of her parents and relatives.

"I never gave up," said Vonn, who took her comeback win in a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada, this season.

"I knew deep inside that I would one day reach this record but now all my family came to support me and to celebrate this special moment. It's such a beautiful day for me. I wanted to do it for them," added Vonn, the girlfriend of golfer Tiger Woods.

Former downhill world champion Elisabeth Goergl of Austria was second, 0.32 seconds adrift, 0.18 faster than third-placed local favourite Daniela Merighetti.

Fellow-Italian Elena Fanchini, winner of Friday's shortened race on the same course, was fourth, 0.77 off the pace.
