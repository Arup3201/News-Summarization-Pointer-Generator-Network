One of Sydney's inner city suburbs has sold a classic terrace on the market, with a price tag that has set the new homeowners back seven digits – but it's completely unliveable.

Located in the heart of Redfern, the two-bedroom property will require an extreme makeover after it had been left empty and abandoned for the past five years.

The wide terrace on Wells Street was snapped up by a young couple for a staggering $1.18 million, which was more than the expected price of $850,000.

Sold by McGrath Real Estate, based in Edgecliff, selling agent Ben Forsyth told the Daily Telegraph that he did not expect the two-storey property to smash the million-dollar barrier.

'I guess everything costs $1 million now,' Mr Forsyth told the Daily Telegraph.

'I think the couple are going to sit on it for a while and wait for plans to go through council. It was a good buy for them.

'A lot of potential buyers were interested because of its block size. The backyard, which is a bit of a sculpture garden, is quite deep.'

It is one of the dilapidated properties in Redfern and formerly an artists's home and studio, it features an original kitchen with multiple living spaces and a wide-fronted sunroom upstairs.

Experts believe the original terrace is a perfect opportunity for new home owners, renovators or developers to upgrade for a tremendous scope to capitalise or even an extensive overhaul.

With a paved rear courtyard and an overgrown stunning garden, the humble terrace is filled with future promises and could potentially design and create a brand new residence or duplex.

While the suburb is slowly undergoing an extreme makeover, it offers a rare prospect and opportunity for young families and investors in prime enclave.

Sitting on a sizeable 201 square metre of block and an impressive 6.6 metre wide frontage, the property features a sun drenched rooftop area set against a leafy urban outlooks.

It occupies a wonderfully peaceful yet central position within walking distance to public transports such as buses and Redfern Station, popular shopping and dining hubs, parks, and just a couple of train stops away from the CBD.
