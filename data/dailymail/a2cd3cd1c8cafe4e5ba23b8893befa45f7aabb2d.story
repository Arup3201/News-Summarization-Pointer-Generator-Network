Gareth Southgate has expressed his complete confidence that racism will not scar England’s play-off clash with Croatia.

Two years ago, England’s black players were racially abused by a hostile crowd in Serbia and a mass brawl broke out on the pitch at the end of a game Stuart Pearce’s side won 1-0.

Vinkovci, where this week’s game will be staged, is close to the Serbian border, but the Under-21 head coach has no concerns about the environment to which England are headed.

‘We have players who were involved in that game against Serbia still in the squad,’ said Southgate. ‘But I don’t think the Croatian people are like that. I’m expecting a tough test, definitely.

‘But having worked with a number of Croatians, they are really good people and I have never felt that element in them. I’m hoping that will be the case.’
