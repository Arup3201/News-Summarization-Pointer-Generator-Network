Ken Perenyi will reveal, in a memoir, how he managed to forge his way to riches by conning high-profile dealers and collectors

A gifted artist who used his exceptional talent to get rich by faking art work will expose all his tricks in a confession-style book.

Ken Perenyi will reveal how he fooled, dealers, collectors and auctioneers into believing his paintings were rare finds by old masters in his memoirs Caveat Emptor: The Secret Life of an American Art Forger.

For four decades American Perenyi,aged 63, who lived in London for 30 years, earned up to $100,000 a time by pretending his paintings were the work of well-known second rate artists, the Observer reported.

He steered away from the greatest masters because they were too well documented and kept under the radar by rotating the auctioneers and visiting regional dealers, often claiming he had found the artwork in a relative’s attic or in a car boot sale.

His specialties included British sporting and marine paintings of the 18th and 19th centuries, painting in the style of artists such as F Herring and Thomas Buttersworth .

The book, to be published next month, is expected to embarrass experts both in Britain and the US who were deceived by the cunning artist.

He tells how he used fake stamps, chalk marks, old inventory labels and salt water to create rust. He even used canvas weaves form India and China which had the irregularities of cloth used by 19th century artists.

Perenyi, who is self-taught, told the Observer that he had attempted to become a legitimate artist.

He added: ‘But every time I needed supplies or food, I would make a fake and sell it...I started to rely on faking more and more. I eventually turned it into a full-blown career.

‘I pride myself on my forensic expertise. I started with extensive research…the correct canvas, correct stretchers…framed in good period antique frames.’

Perenyi's specialities include British sporting and marine paintings of the 18th and 19th Centuries. He concentrated on the work of well-known but second-rank artists

Perenyi told dealers he had spotted the paintings at car boot sales or that they were found in a relatives attic

He was behind the forgery of Ruby Throats with Apple Blossoms by the American 19th-century artist Martin Johnson which was hailed as a major ‘discovery’ and fetched nearly $100,000 at auction in New York.

Although investigated by FBI, the case against Perenyi was dropped in 2003, subject to the statute of limitations, which leaves him free to publish his secrets. 

He was never told why the case was dropped, but he believes the art world would be keen to prevent the exposure of the serial forgeries.

Publisher Pegasus Books said Perenyi’s confession is ‘certain to be a bombshell for the major international auction houses and galleries’.

Today he owns a studio in Maderia Beach, Florida.
