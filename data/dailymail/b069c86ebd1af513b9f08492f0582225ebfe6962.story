A Mississippi man believes that a hairless, dog-like animal he shot on his property isn't a dog at all - according to Matthew Harrell, the animal he killed is the legendary Chupacabra, a ferocious creature that most animal experts agree is a nothing more than an urban legend.

Mr. Harrell was 'coon hunting' at his home in Leake County when he first was confronted by the four-legged beast. At first, he thought the animal was a raccoon, or coyote - his neighbor reported that the animal already had killed three of his chickens.

His opinion quickly changed when - according to Mr. Harrell - he noticed that the animal had glowing red eyes and that it appeared aggressive.

Legend: A Mississippi man says this animal killed on his property is a legendary Chupacabra

Convinced: Hunter Matt Hewharrell is certain that the animal he killed is a Chupacabra

'This one just wasn't lunging. He was down like a cat,' Harrell told 
WJTV-TV. 'When I was standing right yonder, he hit right here. And I was
 seeing the teeth and red eyes. It looked like he was going to jump down
 there and I didn't give him the chance.'

Mr. Harrell shot the animal with a .22-calibur rifle. He then shot it again to make sure he'd killed it.

The animal, Mr. Harrell noticed, is nearly hairless and has nails much longer than a dog's. He's convinced the animal is a Chupacabra.

'My dog, even when it’s dead, my dog’s been scared of it,' Mr. Harrell says of the animal.

Chupacabra translates from Spanish to 'goat-sucker,' in reference to the legendary animal's affinity for sucking the blood of live animals, particularly domesticated goats. The legend of the Chupacabra date back to 1995 in Puerto Rico, where many local farmers claimed to have seen the animal after finding their livestock had been killed.

Claws: Hewharrell insists that the animal's claws are much longer than that of a dog or coyote

Sightings of the animal have been reported throughout Mexico and much of the United States, particularly in the Southwest, where it is usually determined that suspected Chupacabras are just emaciated, sickly coyotes.

The description of the Chupacabra varies, but typically those who claim to see the animal describe it as being about the size of a small bear, with a row of spines along its back.

In 2004, a rancher near San Antonio killed a supposed Chupacabra that he claimed had been killing his livestock. DNA from the animal later revealed that it was a coyote with demodectic or sarcoptic mange.

Fangs: Harrell insists that the animal's teeth are also indicative of a Chupacabra

In nearly a dozen other cases where the suspected Chupacabra's body has been discovered, DNA testing showed that the animal was some sort of wild canine with severe skin disorders, particularly mange.

Harrell - who is defiant in his belief that the animal he killed is in fact a Chupacabra - has disposed of much of the animal. However, he says he's saved some of the animal for science.

'Auburn University called up wanting a sample,' he told the Huffington Post. 'I saved a jawbone with teeth, and cut off the ears and toenails. That's all I could stomach.'
