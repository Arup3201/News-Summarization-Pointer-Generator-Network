Apple is said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its smartwatch - dubbed the iWatch.

According to the Financial Times (FT), the tech firm wants to bring in fresh pairs of eyes to look at the device because its in-house developers may be struggling to solve the problems.

A source told the paper that Apple started 'hiring aggressively' in recent weeks, which suggests that the smartwatch is nowhere near being ready for release and could be pushed back to next year.

Speculation around Apple's iWatch - the wearable technology that can connect to smartphones and display 
texts, Facebook notifications and more on a device on the wearer's wrist - began at the end of last year.

Chinese websites reported in December that the computer 
giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It is thought to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other rumours suggest that the iWatch will feature Siri voice control to let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The screen could switch on when a user flicks their wrist.

It would connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth meaning wearers could see messages and access menus without getting their phone from their pocket.

The iWatch could also be Wi-Fi enabled and show tweets, weather and be able to download apps.

The watch could also be as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

The iWatch would be a move away from Apple's current iPhone, iPad and iPod products and one source told the FT that the device involves 'hard engineering problems that they [in-house staff] have not been able to solve'.

Apple is believed to have started 'seeking out acquisitions 
of early-stage start-ups working on connected devices.'

A senior member of the iWatch team, who recently considered leaving 
the company, decided to stay after being given a pay rise, one source told the FT.

The FT even claims that Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, could still decide to shelve the product.

Indro Mukerjee, the CEO of Plastic Logic that makes flexible displays like the one rumoured for the iWatch, told MailOnline he isn't surprised Apple is seeking outside help: 'In order to make a smart watch and use the whole surface (not just the face), there needs to be the ability to make a display which can be completely bent around the wrist and remain robust enough to be able to frequently put it on and take it off.

'As the market for wearable technology grows, the search for specialised talent will also intensify.'

Speculation around Apple's iWatch - the wearable technology that can connect to smartphones and display 
texts, Facebook notifications and more on a device on the wearer's wrist - began at the end of last year.

Chinese websites reported in December that the computer 
giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It is thought to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Patent applications published in March suggested that Apple was 
working on a device with a bendy strap that could be snapped onto a 
wearer's wrist, and would have a flexible display.

Similar devices are already on the market, including the Pebble smartwatch that launched from a successful Kickstarter campaign, and the Android.ly device developed by Indian college students.

Apple is believed to have 100 people working on its iWatch, according to recent rumours, but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering. Here is MacUser magazine's mockup of what the iWatch could look like

Samsung announced earlier this month it is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health.

Samsung announced earlier this month that it, too, is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health.

‘Eventually you won’t even know you’re wearing the device, it could be the fabric in your clothing, your glasses or your watch,’ Samsung’s Chief Strategy Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference in San Francisco at the start of July.

As well as the iWatch, Apple is rumoured to be working on a plastic version of its iPhone, pictured, according to images leaked on a Chinese site

If the FT's sources are to be believed and Apple has only just begun hiring development support, the release date of the iWatch could be pushed back to 2014 - previous reports expected the device to be announced later this year. 

During April's earnings call, Mr Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services that we can't wait to introduce this fall.'

Aside from the iWatch, Apple is also thought to be working on a low-cost colourful iPhone Mini, as well as the follow-up to the Apple iPhone 5 - dubbed Apple iPhone 5S.

And earlier this month, International Business Times magazine claimed that one, or possibly both, of these products will be launched in September.

The new, cheaper handset could be made of plastic to keep costs down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink and blue.

The new iPhone 5S model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but includes a faster processor and updated camera.

It will also run iOS 7, the major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software launched last month.

Both handsets could be released in time for the iOS 7 roll out in October.

Apple recently hired Paul Deneve, from Yves Saint Laurent, to work on undefined 'special projects'.

The FT continued that Deneve may have been brought in to use his experience in fashion and luxury goods to help develop the branding for the iWatch.

After Chinese sites began reporting on the iWatch rumours in December, a number of designers created realistic concept images in a bid to predict what it would look like. This concept was by Italian designer Antonio De Rosa

A Japanese patent in February detailing Apple's plans for an iWatch followed an earlier application to the U.S Patent Office in 2011. This image, taken from the American Patent Application describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap

A patent application filed by Apple in February revealed that its iWatch could use the same technology as a 
child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist.

Later that month a number of designers from Sweden, San Francisco and Italy - among others - began creating mock-ups of what the watch could look like.

These included glass and coloured straps with digital, touchscreen faces.

In March, MacUser magazine designed a mock-up of what the watch could look like and its version contained a small screen - similar to the iPod Nano - would be mounted to a traditional leather strap.

Cook then fuelled the rumours further by telling the AllThingsD conference in June that wearable tech was an area 'ripe for exploration' and 'incredibly interesting'.

Apple has not made any official comment about the iWatch or the news reported by the FT.
