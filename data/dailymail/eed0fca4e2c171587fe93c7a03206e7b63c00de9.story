The cast is known for their stiff upper lip at dinner parties and restraint in responding to a range of dramas ranging from death to murder and secret love children.

Lady Mary is cold, the Dowager Countess of Downton Abbey sometimes unkind. 

But now the secret behind their detachment has been revealed, as the stars have been banned from being tactile to make the series more believable.

The cast of Downton Abbey have been banned from hugging each other to make the series historically accurate, but occasionally breaks convention, such as Lady Mary's night of passion with Lord Tony Gillingham

Alastair Bruce, who advisers producers of the ITV drama on etiquette and historical accuracy, said characters should not hug or show lots of affection to each other as this was simply not done in the 1920s.

A lack of antibiotics in the era meant disease was less easy to cure and spread rapidly, so people would avoid physical contact in a bid to reduce the risk of becoming ill. 

'I tell the actors not to touch each other,' Mr Bruce told BBC Radio 2. 

'I don't want any hugging, no physical contact; they just didn't do that in those days.' 

His reasoning sheds some light on some of the Downton Abbey storylines. 

When Lady Mary, played by Michele Dockery, receives little comfort from her family after the death of her husband Matthew Crawley following the birth of their first child. Despite the tragedy characters show restraint, with Lady Edith unable to comfort her bereaved sister.

Lady Mary Crawley and Anthony Gillingham appear to break with the stiff upper lip convention of the show  

Mr Bruce said the number of Downton Abbey devotees, who are known for paying strict attention to the historical accuracy of the Julian Fellowes show, means he tries to be extra strict to make the series as realistic as possible. 

'It is important getting the detail right and the pressure does increase,' added Mr Bruce, who also advised producers of the King's Speech. 

'People long to find error.'

However, just as a television aerial was seen on set and a plastic water bottle in a publicity photograph, some instances appear to have slipped through the net. 

In episode one of the series four Carson, the trusted butler, appears to break with both 1920s convention and the upstairs-downstairs rule, as he warmly hugs Lady Mary who is still struggling to come to terms with her new role as a widow.

And Lady Mary's night of passion with Lord Tony Gillingham also appears to go against the cold, detached expectations of the era. 

The scene where Lady Sybil dies, in which a number of characters comfort and try to hug her, also shows the cast departing from their usual detached interactions.  

However Lady Mary, whose character is known for her frosty approach, manages to bring back the coldness in series five as she appears shocked that her sister has run away after her secret love child was revealed.

 'I can't think why!' she exclaimed.

The response, typically Downton, from the Dowager was: 'My dear. A lack of compassion can be as vulgar as an excess of tears.'
