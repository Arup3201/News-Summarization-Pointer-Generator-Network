Rhyan Wilson, 18, died after suffering fatal injuries in a fight which took place outside a pub in Urmston, Greater Manchester, shortly before 2am

A 25-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after an 18-year-old suffered fatal injuries in a fight which is believed to have spilled out of a pub in Urmston, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of this morning.

The woman, who is understood to have known the victim, is being questioned in custody following the death of Rhyan Wilson, who died in hospital after being stabbed in the chest.

A second 18-year-old from Stretford, Greater Manchester, was stabbed in the neck and leg during the same fight and was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary where he is in a stable condition.

A murder investigation is now underway.

Police said they were alerted to a report of a group of men and women fighting on Flixton Road at 1.55am.

It is not yet known how many people were involved in the fight, which is thought to have taken place outside the Ivory sports bar and nightclub.

A large area of Flixton town centre was sealed off this morning as police forensic investigations continued.

A senior detective said there was a 'verbal altercation' outside the Ivory sports bar and nightclub which 'escalated into violence'.

Detective Superintendent Andy Peach said: 'Clearly this is a shocking incident and a man has lost his life.

'However, I can reassure the community that we will thoroughly investigate what happened this morning and do not believe that members of the public are at risk.

'From early accounts we believe there was an earlier verbal altercation outside the Ivory pub which escalated into violence and this tragic death.

'From what we can tell, the people involved in the disturbance knew each other. We have made an arrest but we believe there are outstanding offenders, which is why we are appealing for witnesses.'

'This happened in Urmston town centre on a busy Friday night and we know there were lots of people out at the time.

'If you saw this incident, or what happened in the lead-up, and we haven't yet spoken to you, then please get in touch.

'I
 would urge anyone who knows something to speak to officers from the 
major incident team and anyone else who has other concerns can speak to 
my officers, who will be providing an increased presence to provide the 
community with reassurance.'
