A Jetstar Airways flight was forced to return to Melbourne – causing a delay for passengers and crew – after one of the travellers was caught drinking and smoking on board.

The Perth-bound flight turned around about an hour after take-off and the disruptive man was arrested after the plane was met by police officers early Sunday morning.

An airline spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the unruly passenger has been banned from flying with Qantas and its subsidiaries, including Jetstar Airways.

A flight attendant told passengers that the man was caught drinking his own booze on board the plane

A YouTube video captured by a passenger shows a man getting out of his seat as Australian Federal Police officers board the plane in Melbourne.

One of the flight attendants tells passengers: ‘Ladies and gentlemen we do have security forces coming on board, we ask you to please remain seated, thank you.’

The man makes his own way to the front of the cabin, where he is met by the officers before being escorted off the plane.

The flight attendant tells passengers that the man was drinking alcohol that he brought on board and was twice caught smoking on the plane.

She added: ‘We carry jet fuel which is 10 times more volatile than car fuel, so for safety reasons [the flight turned around]’.

The plane was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide, and return to Melbourne

The cross-country flight normally takes four hours to complete, but was forced to turn around over Gulf St Vincent, west of Adelaide.

Flight JQ968 landed in Melbourne at about 1:40am local time and departed for Perth a second time about an hour later, putting it well behind schedule.

A Jetstar Airways spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald: ‘We regret that the passenger’s actions interrupted the travel plans of others.’

She said the man has been placed on the ‘no fly list’ used by Qantas and its subsidiaries until further notice.
