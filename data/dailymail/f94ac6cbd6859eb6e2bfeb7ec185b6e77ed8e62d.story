Jean Léonard Teganya was arrested on the Maine/Canada border after being wanted for war crimes

A 42-year-old Rwandan citizen who is wanted for war crimes has been arrested at the border of Maine and Canada, U.S. Border Patrol says.

Jean Léonard Teganya is wanted for deportation for violating human rights under the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act related to the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, a Canadian warrant says.

An agent found Teganya in the Houlton, Maine, area near the border with Canada on Aug. 3.

Teganya was sent to Houlton Station for processing on a violation of entry without inspection.

The patrol says a database search revealed the warrant for Teganya, the patrol says.

He was turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Teganya's lawyer said he wasn't aware his client was detained.

The Rwandan genocide saw up to one million Rwandans killed between April and July in 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War.

Teganya's arrest comes as two top leaders of Cambodia's former Khumer Rouge regime have been sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity during the 1970s genocide that left as many as two million people dead.

The trial of Khieu Samphan, 83, the regime's head of state, and Nuon Chea, 88, right-hand man to the group's late leader, Pol Pot, began in November 2011 and ended with closing arguments in October 2013. More than 100,000 people attended its 222 sessions.

Both men were found guilty of 'extermination encompassing murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, enforced disappearances and attacks against human dignity.'
