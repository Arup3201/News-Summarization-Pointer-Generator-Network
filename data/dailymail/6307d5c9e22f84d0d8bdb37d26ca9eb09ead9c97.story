An Army recruit has been  prosecuted by the RSPCA for swallowing his pet goldfish as part of the NekNomination drinking game.

Gavin Hope, 22, filmed himself drinking a pint glass of beer, spirits, a raw egg and some fish food, before downing a glass of water containing the unfortunate fish.

The video was uploaded to his Facebook page along with the comment: ‘Not a proper man unless you drink fish.’

Swallowed: Gavin Hope and the goldfish Neknomination which lead to him to being brought before Gateshead magistrates court

The footage was seen by the RSPCA and Hope was charged with animal cruelty in the first prosecution related to the drinking game.

He was ordered to pay a £300 fine after admitting the offence.

The prosecution told Gateshead Magistrates' Court that the goldfish suffocated and died as a result of the stunt.

Hope’s defence, Rachel Mangenie, said the creature, which did not have a name, had ‘deserved to be treated  with respect’.

She added: ‘No one is trying to minimise the effect on the goldfish, but he hasn’t made that goldfish suffer for a long period.’

Hope, a father of one, videoed himself carrying out the bizarre act at his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in January.

The 22-year-old gulped down the drink on camera, and footage was later seen by the RSPCA

It was part of a NekNomination stunt –
 the drinking game in which people post videos of themselves drinking 
dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol, then dare their friends to
 outdo them.

The video shows Hope, who is due to join the Armed Forces as a Royal  Engineer in September, thanking a friend for nominating him.

He then downs a concoction in a pint glass, comprising of a bottle of Stella, chilli powder, the spirit Jägermeister, a raw egg and some fish food.

He says: ‘There’s a reason the fish food is going in and I’m about to show you why.’ Holding up a glass containing the fish, he adds: ‘That’s why’ – before swallowing the fish.

Prosecuting for the RSCPA, Judith Curry, said: ‘The fish was in a totally unsuitable environment which in time would have led to its death.’

In an interview, Hope said he had owned the goldfish for a couple of months. He thought it was ill because it kept swimming into the sides of its tank and he was going to flush it down the toilet before deciding to drink it as part of his Neknomination challenge.

Miss Mangenie, for Hope, told the court: ‘Clearly this was a very foolish thing for Gavin Hope to do.  He is a young man aged 22 who has never appeared inside the courts before.

‘It is something that has taken a toll on him and he is extremely ashamed of himself. He is genuinely remorseful and apologetic. He accepts this type of behaviour is absolutely unacceptable.’

She described it as an ‘impulsive act’ and said the procedures had given Hope a ‘short,  sharp, shock’.

Miss Mangenie added: ‘This was an act of stupidity. He has a young son who he is trying to get regular contact with. He wants to put this behind him.’

Magistrate David Randall said: ‘We consider this to be a thoughtless, stupid incident.’

He ordered Hope to pay a £300 fine, £30 victim surcharge and £431.17 in court costs.

In a statement, RSPCA chief inspector Michelle Charlton said: ‘A vet report advised that the stomach would be a completely unsuitable place for a goldfish.

‘Eating a live animal and posting a video of it online for entertainment is not some light-hearted joke – it is unacceptable.’

A fish swallowed alive will survive no more than four minutes in a human stomach, experts said last night.

Marine biologist Alasdair Lindop, said: ‘Generally a stomach would be pretty inhospitable to a goldfish, largely due to the high acid content.’
