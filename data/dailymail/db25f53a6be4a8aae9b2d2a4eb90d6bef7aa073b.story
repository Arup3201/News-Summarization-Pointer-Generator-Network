Oxford Lord Mayor Alan Armitage has today resigned after allegedly making inappropriate remarks to a schoolgirl aged 13

A disgraced Lord Mayor who allegedly told a 13-year-old schoolgirl she looked 'sexy' when she bent over has today resigned from his post.

Liberal Democrat Alan Armitage quit his coveted role as Lord Mayor of Oxford today after being accused of telling the teenager: 'It's sexy when you bend down like that'.

The alleged incident happened while the youngster and other members of an under-13s sport team were having their photograph taken with him.

The
 married father-of-three, who is a city and county councillor, claims he
 may have said ‘best if you stand next to me’ and was misheard.

Mr Armitage's resignation follows a ruling by the council's standards committee last week that it was 'highly probable' he did make an 
‘inappropriate and disrespectful’ comment.

At
 a hearing held in secret to protect the girl’s identity, they ruled he 
had brought the office of Lord Mayor and the city council into 
disrepute. 

But apart 
from being ‘censured’ – effectively, given a telling off – the council took no disciplinary action and allowed him to remain Lord 
Mayor.

Mr Armitage, who is also a county 
councillor for West Central Oxford, said at the time he had no intention
 of giving up his position of Lord Mayor.

Speaking
 after he was censured, he said: 'My county council position is up for 
election and I have not yet decided whether to continue and fight it in 
May. I have not heard from anyone that I ought to be resigning.

'I
 have said all along that I may have said some of the words which are 
imputed to me but it is not very likely. I have tried to tell the 
truth.'

But the shamed public figure 
today announced his decision in an email to his fellow councillors and Oxford 
city council's chief executive, Peter Sloman.

Despite quitting his role as Lord Mayor, it is understood he has not left his post as a councillor.

Current deputy mayor Mohammed Abbasi will step into the role temporarily until the completion of the Mayoral year in May.

His comments were branded 'absolutely 
unacceptable' by the chairman of Oxford's Liberal Democrats.

Following the decision to censure Mr 
Armitage, Tony De Vere, chairman of Oxford West and Abingdon Liberal 
Democrats, said: 'Such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and this is a
 matter the Liberal Democrats take extremely seriously.

'We have started the process of seeking appropriate disciplinary action.'

The investigation began after a 
parent complained to the girl’s school about the incident in June last 
year, a month after Mr Armitage began his year in office as Lord Mayor.

The
 school passed it to Oxfordshire County Council’s child protection team,
 which found Mr Armitage was not a risk to youngsters.

But it did pass its findings to Oxford City Council to see if its code of conduct had been breached.

There were differing accounts of what Mr Armitage was alleged to have said.

They
 included: ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’; ‘bending is very 
sexy, isn’t it?’; and ‘ooh, that’s a bit sexy’. It is understood the 
girl and up to five witnesses gave evidence about the alleged offending 
comment.

Mr Armitage 
denied the allegation.
