Too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them as they attempt to 'copy American film stars', according to some of the great and good of theatre.

Doing away with the clear and enunciated acting style of yesteryear, some  directors and producers actively encourage 'laidback mumbling', as it is more 'truthful', it has been said.

But it has infuriated well established and leading theatre figures, including Edward Kemp, the artistic director of Rada and renowned classical actress Imogen Stubbs.

Imogen Stubbs as Lady Torrance in 'Orpheus Descending'. But the established theatre actress says too many actors are mumbling their way through lines leaving audiences struggling to understand them

Mr Kemp is concerned that the new style of delivery could mean audiences are driven away from stage productions of the works of Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde, among others, because they are unable to understand them, the Observer reports.

Ms Stubbs is concerned that the muttering is an attempt to imitate American film stars.

She leveled particular criticism at Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, saying: 'You're just longing for it to stop and breathe...They were rather garbling their lines.'

Mr Kemp said the problem was with 'education'.

He said Rada had had to change its training programme to adapt to teenagers who did not have the 'faintest notion of basic grammar'.

He said he had even encountered a first year student who had achieved an English A-level who had no idea what a noun was, and revealed Rada had to do away with a sight-reading test of a Dickens passage from auditions because it was too painful to listen to.

He said older and established actors honed their deliver through the use of pitch, intonation and tempo -Â  whereas today's actors relied on volume.

While Ms Stubbs said that others are terrified of being caught sounding 'like an old-fashioned actor'.

Rada is rethinking its voice training as it gets ready to launch its first public festival, which will be held from 29 June until 6 July .
