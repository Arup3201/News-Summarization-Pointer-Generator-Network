An 83-year-old woman who went missing from Ronald Regan Washington National Airport has been found drowned in the Potomac River.

Victoria Kong, who suffers from dementia, reportedly walked past an American Airlines representative her family had sent to meet her when she got off a plane from Barbados on Friday.

Searchers, volunteers and Mrs Kong's family spent the weekend combing the area around the airport.

On Monday, her body was found in the water off Gravelly Point, which is a park just up the highway from the airport.

Tragic: Mrs Kong's body was found a short distance from the airport, in the Potomac River

Her family is furious and says the 
airline did not do enough to protect the elderly woman and the airport 
did not do enough to sound the alarm and look for her when she first 
disappeared.

American Airlines says it sent an 
employee to meet Mrs Kong, but she walked right past as she left the 
plane and never made contact with the airline.

She was seen on surveillance cameras
making her way through the airport terminal and then later walking 
north along a paved trail for hikers and bicycles towards Roosevelt Island.

Mrs Kong's family said that they were waiting for her at baggage claim to be escorted off the American Airlines flight in a wheelchair but that she never showed up.

Concerns: Mrs Kong's family said that she was suffering from early signs of dementia

Sprawling: Mrs Kong was supposed to meet her family at baggage claim but became lost after leaving the flight

It is unclear how the elderly woman 
managed to leave the terminal. However Reagan National Airport has 
several sprawling terminals over three levels, with 44 arrival gates 
situated some distance from at least a dozen baggage claim points.

American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller confirmed to MailOnline that Ms Kong had been traveling on Flight 1094 on Friday.

He
said: 'While we understand that onboard assistance was not requested 
for deplaning, we have been working with our vendor that provides 
wheelchair assistance and have learned that the wheelchair waiting for 
Ms. Kong was not claimed after deplaning.

'We are concerned about Ms. Kong and are assisting authorities with their investigation.'

Her granddaughter Alexandria Anderson said Mrs Kong had been showing some early signs of dementia and they are worried about her safety.

Miss Anderson told Fox: 'I'm
concerned she doesn't know how to call us, how to reach us, how to find
us. I'm concerned she doesn't know we are looking for her.'

Hunt: Police and volunteers are searching the area surrounding the Washington DC airport for the missing elderly woman
