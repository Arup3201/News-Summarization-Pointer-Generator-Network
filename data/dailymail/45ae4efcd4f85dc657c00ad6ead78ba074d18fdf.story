The mother of a two-year-old boy who fell 10 feet into a cheetah enclosure could face child endangerment charges after witnesses claim she was dangling him over the edge.

Visitors at Cleveland Metroparks Zoo in Ohio heard a scream as the toddler tumbled into the pit at 3pm on Saturday.

His parents jumped in and pulled him to safety before paramedics arrived to treat the boy for a leg injury. 

Though the felines appeared to avoid the child, Dr Christopher Kuhar, executive director at the zoo, said there is a strong chance charges will be pressed on Monday.

The boy was rescued by his parents from the pit (pictured) before firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene. He suffered from minor bumps and bruises and was listed in stable condition at the hospital 

He told CNN: 'Unfortunately, we have a number of eyewitness accounts that point to the strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the rail.'

According to witnesses the mother was holding him and another child when he fell.  

Michael Lurie and his family were at the Cheetah exhibit when they heard the child scream. 

'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC.  

'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' 

The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials.

Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 

'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 

'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.'   

The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.
