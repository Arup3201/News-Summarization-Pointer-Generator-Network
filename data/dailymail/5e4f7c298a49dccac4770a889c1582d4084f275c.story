Two unfinished sketches by Paul Cezanne have been discovered on the reverse side of two watercolors after remaining unseen for almost one hundred years.

Officials at Philadelphia's Barnes Foundation museum says the collector who bought the paintings more than 90 years ago probably never knew the hidden sketches were there.

The foundation said the sketches — one graphite and the other watercolor — were found during conservation work on the reverse sides of two Cezanne watercolors depicting the landscape of southern France.

Two Cezanne drawings were found on the backs of his watercolors undergoing restoration at the Barnes Foundation, including this graphite sketch of houses found on the back of his work Trees

Officials said that the sketches haven't been seen since at least the early 20th century, 'most likely prior to Dr. Albert Barnes's purchase of the works from Leo Stein in 1921.'

'We've had (the watercolors) out of the frame before. But the backs were covered with brown paper,' said Barbara Buckley, the foundation's senior director of conservation and chief painting conservator, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 

'That's one of the reasons they were sent (for conservation). Brown paper is very acidic, and they needed acid-free paper.'

Officials said Cezanne often worked on both sides of the paper in his sketchbooks and on larger sheets, producing thousands of such drawings over the course of his career, but they were usually done 'to experiment with line and color.'

Mr Barnes bought the watercolors for $100 each, according to the New York Times. 

The additional small experiments by the artist, who influenced many 20th century luminaries such as Pablo Picasso, may be worth a fortune.

Cezanne's series The Card Players includes one of the most expensive paintings ever sold, a picture that the Qatari royal family bought for $263million.

Paul Cezanne, (seen left in 1906, the year of his death and right in 1895 self-portrait) influenced much of 20th century art and his works regularly sell for millions of dollars

His watercolors have fetched up to $25million at auction, according to Art Daily. 

Ms Buckley said the sketches, which were on the back of watercolors normally on view in one of the galleries, offer a window into Cezanne's artistic process.

On the back of 'The Chaine de l'Etoile Mountains,' conservators found that Cezanne had begun a sketch of trees with pencil and then color, but the center of the sketch is so unfinished it's hard to determine what it represents. 

Marks on the sketch include the word 'non', likely meaning that the work was not complete enough to be sold.

On the back of 'Trees,' conservators found a detailed depiction without color of houses and the same Etoile range that was often the subject of the artist's sketches and paintings.

'We had no reason to think there was anything there,' said Ms Buckley, who said nothing was found on the back of another Cezanne watercolor after conservation work in 2007. 

Barnes officials say 15 unknown Cezanne drawings have been found in the last three decades.

The Barnes Foundation, seen in its old building in 2003, also owns one of Cezanne's Card Players series, one of which sold for $263million to the Qatari royal family

Martha Lucy, a Drexel University assistant professor of art and art history and a former Barnes curator, said Cezanne frequently walked along a route that looked out over the Etoile mountains. 

The range ran near his home in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France.

'Cezanne walked frequently there and did many depictions of it,' Lucy said.

Both Ms Lucy and Ms Buckley said they believe that Albert Barnes was unaware that he had acquired, in Ms Lucy's words, 'four for the price of two.' 

The correspondence between Mr Barnes and Mr Stein, the brother of Gertrude Stein, contains no mention of the drawings, so the seller likely did not know about them either.

The foundation plans to display the works in double-sided frames that will allow viewing of both sides from April 10 through May 18, after which the watercolors will be returned to their original locations.

The Barnes Foundation was undergoing a multiyear restoration project for its work when the new sketches were discovered
