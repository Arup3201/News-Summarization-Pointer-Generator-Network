Prosecutors in Florida have reversed their decision to accept an insanity plea for a father who kidnapped his two sons and tried to sail to Cuba last spring.

Authorities had been prepared to let Joshua Hakken and his wife Sharyn get psychiatric treatment instead of prison - but a series of recent jailhouse phone calls have led them to believe that Joshua, at least, is faking it.

The Hakkens were arrested in April after allegedly kidnapping their sons Cole and Chase, age 4 and 2, from there grandparents in North Tampa, Florida. The parents had lost custody of their children and the grandparents had sole legal guardianship because of multiple run-ins with police.

'Mr Hakken is feigning insanity,' Assistant State Attorney Rita Peters Peters declared at a court hearing Tuesday, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Ms
 Peters said 'additional information that has developed since the last 
court date' from Mr Hakken's jail phone calls that led prosecutors to 
believe he was malingering.

She did not go into detail about what exactly Mr Hakken said that led prosecutors to reverse course.

Even
 the expert witnesses called by he state had concluded that Mr Hakken, 
an engineer, was 'paranoid and delusional' at the time he kidnapped his 
children - believing that the federal government was performing mind 
control experiments on him.

The Hakkens sailed to Cuba, where they were apprehended by U.S. authorities and sent back to Tampa. The grandparents now have custody of the two children.

Prosecutors
 released evidence showing Joshua Hakken believed the federal government
 was targeting him because he had uncovered a secret plot to poison 
Americans with airplane chemicals.

Jail cell footage released in September showed the couple discussing the plot to allegedly kidnap their sons - and desperately urging each other to stay quiet.

 and Sharyn Hakken are seen embracing, kissing and apparently talking 
about what they will say about the kidnapping on the video released by 
prosecutors.

Prosecutors 
also shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old 
woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she 
is '100% committed to you and our relationship'.

The
 Hakkens have been charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody 
and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped their sons from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted
 custody of them just a week earlier.

After
 the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they 
were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras 
filmed their conversations on April 10.

'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.'

'I
 know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I 
said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported.

The couple, who have both pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping charges, also apparently discussed their release from jail.

'When everything goes down I'll come 
find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out 
before you, I promise I'll wait for you.'

Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year.

They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition.

Prosecutors said the Hakkens had 
become paranoid about living in the U.S., claiming the government was 
trying to hack their computers and poison them. They had asked 11 
countries for asylum, documents show.

They
 lost custody of the boys last year after police officers in Louisiana 
found them and the children in a hotel room surrounded by weapons and 
drugs.

On April 3, Joshua Hakken allegedly 
forced his way into his mother-in-law's home, tied her up and put the 
boys in his car, before setting sail for Cuba.

Officials
 in Cuba learned that the parents were wanted in connection with a 
kidnapping and contacted U.S. authorities, who flew them back.

When
 the boys were returned, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob 
Hauser revealed that the youngsters, who were not harmed, did not know 
they were allegedly kidnapped.

'They
 have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - 
"another country", as they call it,' Mrs Hauser said at a press 
conference.

'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone 
wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a 
vacation.'

Mr Hauser said that they had never imagined they would be bringing up Cole and Chase - but that the 'smart, chatty' boys were a joy each day.

'It was initially a change of life-style for us, but having these boys here is just amazing,' he said.
