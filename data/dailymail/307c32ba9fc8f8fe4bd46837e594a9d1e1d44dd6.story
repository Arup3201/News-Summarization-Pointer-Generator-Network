Leeds United are considering an approach to Swindon Town for manager Mark Cooper.

The 45-year-old has forged a decent reputation with Swindon in League One and is the son of former Leeds and England favourite Terry Cooper.

Leeds owner Massimo Cellino sacked David Hockaday just 70 days after putting him in charge and is understood to have spoken to Italian coach Rolando Maran. 

Wanted man: Championship outfit Leeds United could make a move for Swindon Town boss Mark Cooper 

Short spell: David Hockaday was sacked after just 70 days in charge at Elland Road

However, Cellino is also keen to have a British coach who knows the English league and its players. 

Cooper fits that profile while his family connection to Leeds appeals as a prospective crowd pleaser.

Steve Clarke and Simon Grayson have also been discussed.
