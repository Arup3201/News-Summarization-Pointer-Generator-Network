The Coalition was hit by a new split last night following claims that George Osborne is blocking plans by Business Secretary Vince Cable to save the ailing British pub.

Liberal Democrat Mr Cable wants to launch a new watchdog to combat allegations that big pub companies are driving tied landlords to the wall by charging too much for beer and rent.

The new rules would give landlords the right to free themselves from brewers.

Community: The Coalition is at loggerheads over how to save the ailing British pub

But the Chancellor has stepped in amid Treasury claims that the changes could strangle the industry with red tape and put up the price of a pint. Mr Osborne has vetoed plans by Mr Cable to launch a public consultation this week, in the run-up to the introduction of new laws later this year.

Mr Cable says the best way to save pubs is to set up a statutory code governing the relationship between pub companies and publicans, backed up by an independent adjudicator. Pubs are currently closing at the rate of 20 a month, and nearly 29,000 of the 55,000 pubs in Britain are tied.

Conservative MP Brian Binley, who backs the new curbs, said last night: ‘The large pub owners have, quite literally, been drinking in the last-chance saloon for too long. These new controls are vital because some landlords have been brought to tears and the brink of bankruptcy by unfair terms. We treat post offices as a vital part of the community and it is time pubs were regarded in the same way.’

The rift between Mr Osborne and Mr Cable has fuelled fresh claims that the Chancellor has ‘sold out’ to big corporations and brewers at the expense of local communities. In the past the breweries were big donors to the Conservative Party, and close links remain in some areas.

The two biggest pub owners, so called pubcos, are Enterprise and Punch Taverns. Other pubs are owned by local breweries. One insider said: ‘The pubcos have organised a highly expensive and sophisticated lobbying organisation and it seems as though it has had a big effect on Tory Cabinet Ministers.

‘The pubcos bought pubs when property prices were high and now prices have slumped they are trying to exploit landlords. All landlords want is the right to a fair rent and to serve the beer their customers want at fair prices.’

Mr Cable said earlier this year: ‘There is some real hardship in the pubs sector, with many pubs going to the wall as publicans struggle to survive on tiny margins. Some of this is due to pubcos exploiting and squeezing their tenants by unfair practices and a focus on short-term profits.

‘I hope my new measures mean publicans are given a fairer chance at running their pubs.’

He added that he had given the pubcos one last chance to change their behaviour last year, but it was clear the self-regulatory approach was not enough.

Mr Cable’s code includes rents and the prices publicans pay for beer. The adjudicator would have the power to investigate and deal with disputes between pub companies and publicans, and impose fines.

Pubcos own thousands of pubs and bars and decide where tied landlords can buy beer from and at what price. The code would prevent tied licensees being forced to pay up to 50 per cent more for beer than other licensees.
