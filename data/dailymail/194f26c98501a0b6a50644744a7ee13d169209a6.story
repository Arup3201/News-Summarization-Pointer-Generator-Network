Johnny Depp and the cocaine dealer who inspired the film Blow have been reunited following the drug smuggler's release from prison.

The actor met George Jung, 72, the man credited with setting up the American cocaine market, after his 20-year stint in FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey ended in June.

According to TMZ, Depp reached out to the ex-drugs boss and invited him to his loft in downtown Los Angeles.

They were said to have relaxed for hours with the Hollywood star's fiance Amber Heard - discussing poetry, books and the movie's late director Ted Demme.

First encounter: It is the first time the pair have met since the actor visited Jung in prison in 2001 before they started shooting Blow

It is the first time the pair have seen each other since Depp visited the self-proclaimed 'coke star' in prison in 2001 - the year the film was released.

'It’s very rare in life that any person opens up their heart and soul to you with unlimited access to their most profound thoughts, dreams, fears, regrets, intimacies,' Depp wrote in a letter regarding that visit.

'Even more rare when you’ve just met that person and, because of the obvious predicament, it’s highly unlikely that you will be spending too much time with them in the near future. So for this and more, I owe a great debt of gratitude to George.'

Jung was released in June. TMZ reported that he will be living in a halfway house on the West Coast as he adjusts to life outside.

The ex-drugs boss was set to be released in November this year after being found responsible for more than 85 per cent of the cocaine smuggled into America in the 1970s and 1980s.

He has been behind bars since 1994 when he was caught with 1,754 pounds of cocaine in Kansas.

The former drug-boss was initially sentenced to 60 years in prison, but his sentenced was reduced after he testified against business partner Carlos Ledher 

He pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy, and received a 60-year sentence.

His sentence, however, was reduced after he testified in the trial of his long-term business partner, Carlos Ledher.

'I was a guy who had a lot of money and unlimited access to cocaine and even if I looked like Bela Lugosi I still had the most beautiful women on the planet because everybody at that time, especially women, were in love with cocaine and of course in love with the money – the access to the automobiles, the clothes, the dinners, the lifestyle,' he told PBS in 2000.

'Basically I was no different than a rock star or a movie star. I was a coke star.'
