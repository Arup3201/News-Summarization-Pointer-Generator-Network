Warning: 'There is a lot of ignorance and rather dim-witted prejudice of Christianity,' outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said

The Archbishop of Canterbury announced his decision to stand down yesterday – and took a parting shot at the 'dim-witted prejudice' of those who are trying to suppress Christianity.

Dr Rowan Williams said he will quit at the end of the year to return to academic life as master of a Cambridge University college.

Hinting at the pressures of the job, he said he hoped his successor would have 'the constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros'.

His departure came at a time of continuing rancour inside the Church over the rights of gay clergy and the appointment of women bishops. Outside there is deepening controversy as ministers try to impose same-sex marriage and remove the right of Christians to wear the cross.

But Dr Williams said he believes Christianity will survive the assault of those who believe faith has no place in public life.

'I think there is a great deal of interest still in the Christian faith,' he said.

'Although I think there is also a lot of ignorance and rather dim-witted prejudice about the visible manifestations of Christianity, which sometimes clouds the discussion.

'I don't think that there is somehow a single great argument that the Church is losing.'

The Archbishop, 61, resigned after ten years at Lambeth Palace, a shorter tenancy than his predecessor Lord Carey, who was five years older than Dr Williams when he chose to retire. His period in office as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury was marked by difficulties and continual church in-fighting.

Dr Williams, who is married to theologian Jane Williams, is known as a warm and humorous man, who said early in his tenure that he liked to watch The Simpsons cartoon series with his two children.

He is known not to carry a mobile phone and also told the New Statesman in 2008 that The Muppet Christmas Carol was one of his favourite films.

Past and future? Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, left, is now tipped to replace Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, right, who announced his departure yesterday

Dr Williams and his wife have been 
careful to keep their children, Pip, now 16 and doing his GCSEs, and his
 daughter Rhiannon, who is 24 and doing a master's degree, out of the 
public eye.

A favoured candidate of Church 
liberals, Dr Williams had the worst possible start as Archbishop when he
 was faced with the selection for the first time ever of an openly gay 
priest for a bishop's job.

The choice of Canon Jeffrey John as 
Bishop of Reading was almost certainly inspired by the assumption in 
2003 that the new Archbishop, a long-time supporter of gay rights, would
 warmly endorse the appointment.

Crowning moment: Dr Williams married Prince William and Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29 last year in front of millions across Britain and the world

But Dr Williams forced Dr John to step down and the powerful CofE gay lobby has never forgiven him.

The Archbishop however can look back 
on success in promoting the cause of women bishops and the personal and 
corporate success of William and Kate's royal wedding last year. He will
 relinquish his role in December to take up the post of Master of 
Magdalene College in Cambridge.

His decision to step down won warm 
tributes, particularly from the colleague who is favourite to succeed 
him, Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu.

Maverick: The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu is a seen both as a visionary and controversial character who is known for stunts like sky-diving with the Red Devils, pictured in 2008, as well as cutting up his dog collar on live TV

Dr Sentamu said: 'Archbishop Rowan is a
 remarkable and gifted leader who has strengthened the bonds of 
affection.' David Cameron said: 'As a man of great learning and 
humility, he has guided the Church through times of challenge and 
change.'

Dr Williams gave an interview in which
 he let slip his impatience with some secular critics of Christianity 
and spoke of the pressures of his job. I think that it is a job of 
immense demands and I would hope that my successor has the constitution 
of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros really.

'But he will, I think, have to look 
with positive, hopeful eyes on a Church which, for all its problems, is 
still for so many people a place to which they resort in times of need 
and crisis, a place to which they look for inspiration. 'I think the 
Church of England is a great treasure.'

Dr Williams' own worst moment is 
likely to have been his speech on sharia law in 2008, when his  advocacy
 of the legal recognition of Islamic law in Britain  briefly threatened 
to tip him out of Lambeth Palace.

The hot favourite to be the next Archbishop of Canterbury and first black leader of the Anglican Church has become well known for his strong opinions on the state of British society.

Dr Sentamu, pictured right, the sixth of 13 brothers and 
sisters, and a former barrister and judge, came to the UK in 1974 having
 fled Uganda where he was a critic of the dictator Idi Amin.

Dubbed by some as 'cleric of the people' he has most recently had a public row with the Government over gay marriage, accusing David Cameron of acting like a 
‘dictator’ and overruling the Bible if he chose to legalise it.

He attracted controversy - and racist emails - when he spoke out against this issue.

Recently he also launched a tirade against Britain's financial institutions and bankers for their role in the collapse of the UK economy.

Using the words of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, he said: 'Banks are more dangerous than a standing army. They can destroy individuals, communities and nations.'

Famously in 2007 he cut up his dog collar on live television in a dramatic protest against Robert Mugabe’s rule, vowing never to wear the symbol of his office again until the Zimbabwe president had been removed from power.

He has also pitched a tent and camped in York Minster for a week, and sky-dived to raise money for families of servicemen wounded or killed in Afghanistan.

In an attack on England he also argued the country must do more to mark St George’s Day on April 23, warning a failure to do so would lead to greater political extremism.

Dr Sentamu’s enthronement in 2005 featured a ceremony with African singing and dancing and contemporary music, with the cleric playing African drums during the service.

Such is his popularity in his archdiocese of York that he was named Yorkshire Man of the Year in 2007.

As Bishop of Stepney in east London, Dr Sentamu acted as an adviser to the inquiry into the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. He has also campaigned against guns, knives, drugs and gangs.

Dr Sentamu is married with two grown-up children and two grown-up foster children.
