The Married at First Sight star who almost left her groom at the altar because she wasn't physically attracted to him once again rebuffs his attempts to get intimate when he leans in to kiss her on their wedding night.

On tonight's episode of the FYI reality show, Ryan Ranellone, 29, from Long Island, New York, admits that he is worried that Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, is trying to put him in the 'friend zone' just hours after they said 'I do'. And just minutes later his fears become reality when the 30-year-old sales rep refuses to get intimate with her new husband once they settle into their honeymoon suite, admitting that he still feels like a stranger to her.  

'I haven't had sex in two years so there is now way we are having sex tonight, so I hope that we can just be buddies,' she says in a sneak peak from the upcoming episode.

Romantic gesture: Ryan Ranellone happily carries his new wife Jaclyn Methuen  on tonight's episode of Marriedat First Sight

Back off: Jaclyn says she needs time to get to know Ryan, but he is worried that she is putting him in the 'friend zone' only hours after they said 'I do' 

The clip shows Ryan romantically carrying Jaclyn across the threshold into their hotel room, just moments before he playfully tosses her on a rose-covered bed – but despite his attempts to try and win Jaclyn over with romantic gestures, she confesses she is still hung up on his looks.

Jaclyn, who has been single for the past seven years, notes that she needs time to adjust to her life-changing decision to marry a total stranger.

'Right off the bat, I am not physically attracted to him,' she explains. 'I don't even know how to be somebody's girlfriend never mind somebody's wife, so I just want to have some time to get to know him.'

But Ryan has no problem expressing how thrilled he is to have Jaclyn as his new wife. 

'We really don't know each other, but the experts definitely did a good job. I am very attracted to my wife, so I am looking forward to enjoying the rest of the evening with her and getting to know each other,' he says.

The newlyweds indulge in some champagne and they joke around as they toss rose petals in the air, but Ryan remains determined to try and get romantic with his wife, who hugged him instead of kissed him at the altar. 

'It feels like two good friends goofing around. I can't say it is exactly what I expected on our wedding night,' he tells the camera. 'I don't want her putting me into that friend zone.'

Ryan can be seen leaning in for a kiss, but it's unclear as to whether or not Jaclyn accepts. 

'Whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to take step back and I need a little space. I need time,' she tells the cameras at the end of the clip. 

On last Tuesday's episode of the reality series, Jaclyn was forced to smile throughout a cringe-worthy post-wedding photoshoot with her new husband as they held hands and cuddled close for their first pictures as newlyweds.

'When I look back at those pictures I am going to see a girl [who] was very overwhelmed - disappointed. I wanted to get a guy that's tall, dark and handsome,' she revealed to the cameras.

At their reception, Jaclyn's female friends reminded her that real-life is not a romantic comedy and that she shouldn't expect love at first sight. 

During the season two premiere of Married at First Sight, it was unclear as to whether or Jaclyn was going to say 'I do' to Ryan, but the reality TV star later confirmed to Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on the Today show that she did indeed marry the groom whose physical appearance was giving her second thoughts.

'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' she said of her disappointment in Ryan. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.'

And while, it looks like she making more of an effort to get to know Ryan on tonight's episode of the show, he might be moving too fast for her taste.
