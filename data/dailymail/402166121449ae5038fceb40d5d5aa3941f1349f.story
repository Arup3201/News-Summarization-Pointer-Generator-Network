Twitter is expanding its reach into real-life commerce with a new tool called 'Offers' allowing retailer to tweet money off coupons which can then be redeemed in store.

Advertisers can post promotions and discounts in users' Twitter feeds, whether or not the users follow those merchants on the short-messaging service.

Users then enter their card information, and when they use it in store, the offer is applied.  

When users see a Twitter Offer in their timeline, they can add the offer to their credit or debit card and redeem it by using the card at the store.

When users see a Twitter Offer in their timeline, they can add the offer to their credit or debit card in just a few taps, and redeem in real time by using the card at the store.

Because the offer is tied to their card, redemption is seamless and easy: there are no coupons to redeem at the point of purchase. 

After the purchase, the cash back savings appear on their card statement within a few days. 

To redeem an offer, customers enter their credit or debit card information. 

They then use the same card to redeem the promotion in a store. 

After they do, they will get cash back on their card. 

For now, the feature only works in the U.S. but Twitter could expand it to other countries.

'We’re planning to work with a handful of brands to begin testing this new feature during the holidays in the U.S,' the firm said.

'Stay tuned for more information of those partners in the near future.' 

San Francisco-based Twitter Inc. says it will encrypt and store the credit card information but users can remove it any time.

The company has slowly been branching out into shopping. 

It launched a 'Buy' button in September that lets users make purchases or donate money to charities without leaving Twitter. 

Facebook is also testing a similar tool.

After the purchase, the cash back savings appear on users card statement within a few days.

Pushing into e-commerce could help Twitter add another source of revenue as the digital advertising market grows and more people shop online. 

It has been trying to increase its user base amid some concerns of a slowdown. 

It had 284 million monthly active users at the end of September, an increase of 23 percent form a year earlier.

Its stock ended Tuesday down 43 cents, or 1 percent, at $39.76.
