Argentina's president has been formally accused of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 bombing at a Jewish centre in Buenos Aires.

The investigation into accusations against Cristina Kirchner will go ahead despite the mysterious death of one of the case's prosecutors, authorities have said. 

Alberto Nisman died just one day before he was due to face questions in Congress over his 289-page complaint against the president and her foreign minister Hector Timerman.

The case will now go before judge Daniel Rafecas who may call upon Kichner to make a statement.

Accused: Argentina's president Cristina Kirchner has been accused of covering up Iran's role in a deadly bombing in Buenos Aires in 1994

Fatal: 85 people died in the explosion at a Jewish centre in Argentina's capital city on July 18, 1994

The 61-year-old has used her Facebook page to deny the allegations and urge her citizens to look at the positives in Argentina.

She wrote: 'You know what? Let’s forget about the hatred, the pain, the insults, the false accusations.

'We have the AUH [an education loan for children of low-income families], pensions, same-sex marriage, more and more human rights, the highest minimum wage in history, nationalized industries, investments in infrastructure, education, universities, scientists, schools and children.'

President Kirchner has been under fire since Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment on January 18.

He accused her of protecting high-ranking Iranian officials from the deadly bombing which left 85 people dead in exchange for oil.

The case's new prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita accepted the deceased Nisman's conclusions. He also accused Kirchner, Foreign Minister Hector Timerman and other government officials of mounting a cover-up and violating their duties, according to a prosecution statement.

He said in a 61-page document: 'An investigation will be initiated with an eye toward substantiating ... the accusations and whether those responsible can be held criminally responsible.'

Mr Pollicita will present his finding to judge Daniel Rafecas - the federal magistrate assigned to the case - who will ultimately decide whether to dismiss it or send it on to trial.

Nisman, 51, was found in his Buenos Aires apartment with a gunshot wound to the head on January 18.

Mysterious: The case's prosecutor Alberto Nisman - who accused the government of secret deals with Iran - died one day before he was due to answer questions in congress

It is still not known if he was murdered or not. His death at the age of 51 was initially labelled a suicide but suspicion has since landed on Kirchner's government.

The president has suggested he was manipulated by disgruntled former intelligence agents who killed him to smear her name.

She branded Nisman's accusation that she conspired to whitewash his investigation 'absurd.' 

With eight months to go before Argentina's presidential election, the Nisman scandal has rocked Kirchner's credibility. She is constitutionally barred from running for a third term in office.
