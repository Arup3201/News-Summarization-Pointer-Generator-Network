In a meeting Tuesday afternoon with executives and lawyers from 14 media companies, Attorney General Eric Holder acknowledged that he and his team 'are not satisfied' with the way search warrants for reporters' phone records and emails were executed in cases involving leaks of classified information.

Referring to his own agency's description of Fox News Channel reporter James Rosen as a possible criminal co-conspirator for reporting information leaked to him by a State Department source, Holder said he was ‘not comfortable with that characterization of Mr. Rosen.’

‘He wasn’t aiding he enemy,' the attorney general said. 'He was just reporting news.’

'There was no chance he was ever going to be prosecuted,' Holder added. ‘I find it incomprehensible that it ever would happen.’

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Fox's James Rosen was just doing his job, and would never have been prosecuted, but an affidavit Holder approved told a federal judge otherwise

The U.S. Department of Justice headquarters in 
Washington, D.C. was the site of Attorney General Eric Holder's meeting 
Tuesday with executives from major U.S. media companies. Fox News 
reporter James Rosen's case has become a rallying cry for journalists 
concerned about government interference with the First Amendment

Holder told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday that his agency had no plans to prosecute reporters involved in leak scandals.

'The Department [of Justice] has not prosecuted, and as long as I'm Attorney General, will not prosecute any reporter for doing his or her job,' he said.

In Tuesday's closed meeting, Holder addressed the cases involving Fox News and the Associated Press, in which the DOJ obtained search warrants for reporters' records and emails without notifying the media companies they work for.

In Rosen's case, Holder personally approved a warrant that leaned on the Espionage Act of 1917 in order to satisfy technicalities in the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. That latter statute requires notification of media outlets before the federal government can interfere with journalists, unless certain conditions are met.

One of those exceptions is the formal identification of a reporter as a criminal suspect.

The DOJ asserted to a federal judge that Rosen himself was an investigative target, and could be criminally liable for publishing state secrets which harmed the United States. That claim, once made, persuaded a judge to approve the warrant.

Holder is now under fire for telling the U.S. Congress that he was wholly unfamiliar with any ‘potential prosecution’ of reporters in cases like these, testimony that Congress is investigating as possible perjury.

Deputy Attorney General James Cole explained that regulations under which the DOJ operates require him to determine -- before notifying a media company that a reporter's records are the subject of a warrant -- that the disclosure will not jeopardize an ongoing investigation.

That, he conceded, put him in the position of having had to prove a negative before notifying the AP or Fox.

But when pressed by MailOnline, Holder confirmed that there is no legal barrier stopping him from declaring on his own that the DOJ will no longer withhold that information from publishers and their attorneys.

‘We could do that,’ he said. ‘The big guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would have to check the box, but yes, we could.’

Holder also acknowledged that during the Obama presidency, his agency has yet to be 'burned' by sharing that kind of information with news agencies involved in similar cases.

And he said that the DOJ has no other outstanding leak cases involving requests for reporters' private records.

Holder agreed that President Obama could approve a new policy requiring the DOJ to notify media outlets every time records of journalists are sought in court, even though certain legal situations don't require it

President Obama has asked the attorney general for a set of recommendations by July 12, describing what can and should be done to change the way his agency treats cases that uncover a conflict between press freedom and national security.

But he was careful to point out that a proposed press shield law, which Obama favors, won't be a substitute for his own responsiveness to the president.

'I don’t want what we do to be tied to the shield law,’ Holder said.

'And I don’t think this is brain surgery.’

The DOJ caught flak from reporters last 
week after inviting them to two similar meetings about press freedoms, 
and initially insisting that they should be considered  'off the 
record.' That designation demands that 
journalists refrain from reporting on the event in any way.

The DOJ 
ultimately relented, holding a sparsely attended meeting on Friday, 
after which reporters and editors were permitted to discuss broadly the 
content of the discussion.

But of Tuesday's meeting, Holder said, 'We weren't intending it to be really "off the record."'

'I'm not sure what the status really is,' he conceded at one point.

MailOnline
 attended the meeting. Attendees on Tuesday were asked to 
'refrain from talking about specific suggestions' offered by the group 
of 20 executives and attorneys, and one working journalist.

Floating those suggestions publicly, a DOJ official said, could cause workable ideas to fall prey to premature public naysaying.

That official also asked that the participants refrain from reporting on the content of discussions about ongoing investigations. Holder's comments, however, make it clear that Rosen is not the subject of any criminal investigation.

MailOnline is also refraining from reporting on solutions the
 group offered to the thorny problem of how to balance national security
 concerns with journalists' freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment 
to the U.S. Constitution.

Media organizations in attendance on Tuesday were the Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Dow Jones, Fox News Channel, the Hearst Corporation, MailOnline, NBC News, the New York Daily News, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Politico, USA Today and The Washington Post.
