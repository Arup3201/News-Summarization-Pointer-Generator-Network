Close your eyes for a moment and you will recall Robin van Persie’s maiden season at Manchester United and the 26 goals that took Sir Alex Ferguson hurtling towards his 13th league title.

Then there was the World Cup in Brazil, when his flying header in the 5-1 defeat of Spain was immortalised by some street artists inside a favela. It was dreamy stuff, alright.

Since then there have been times when you want to shake Robin van Persie like a rag doll and ask him straight out whether he will ever be the same again. Please Robin, say yes.

Van Persie helped Manchester United claim all three points against Southampton at St Mary's

He remains a ruthless finisher, scoring the two goals here at St Mary’s that have taken United into third place in the Barclays Premier League. There is a sense they will stay there now.

Certainly there were flashes here, against Southampton, that Van Persie wants to add to the single Premier League trophy he has to show for brilliant career in front of goal.

In our heart of hearts we know that Van Persie, who scored in each half of this 2-1 victory, is every bit as good as Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero or Chelsea forward Diego Costa.

Perhaps we have grown accustomed to Van Persie over the years, scoring goals for Arsenal, United and Holland, and have simply grown accustomed to his name appearing on Jeff Stelling’s ticker.

These days we seem to talk ceaselessly of Aguero and Costa, arguing blindly on twitter, on bar stools or with colleagues about who is the better striker. Perhaps it is Van Persie.

He has been forgotten in all this, assumed to have taken his eye off the ball after Holland blew it all in the World Cup semi-final against Argentina in Sao Paulo.

Van Persie now has six in the Premier League: one each in games against Leicester, West Ham, Chelsea, Hull and the two here against Southampton.

Van Persie joined Manchester United for £24million in 2012 after leaving Arsenal

Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa have been in outstanding form for Manchester City and Chelsea respectively

Both were tidy finishes, beating Fraser Forster in the first half with a weighted shot to put United in front and then reading Wayne Rooney’s flighted free-kick to win it.

When he scored the opener, he nodded his head and ran towards the outstretched arms of his captain. He still has it; maybe you never lose it.

The goals were good, but there was also much to admire about his improvisation when his spin made Southampton’s central midfielder Steven Davis look a mug in the second half.

This was the real Van Persie, the man who took responsibility for launching United’s title charge when he made sure Arsenal sold him in July 2012 for £24million. The little boy inside him called it right.

It is easy to look back at last season, when injury affected his game and many regard it as a failure. He still scored 12 times in 21 Premier League appearances and infamously claimed ‘to be learning something new every day under David Moyes’ in a ridiculous interview with United’s matchday programme.

It is fair to say that he was never at his best. 

Van Persie and Rooney have managed to keep Radamel Falcao out of Louis van Gaal's starting line-up

Van Gaal gives fellow countryman Van Persie a celebratory hug after the striker inspired his side to victory 

Here at Southampton he had just two shots on target and scored from both of them, which goes a long way to explaining why he is such a revered finisher.

United did not play well and yet Van Persie’s two finishes made the difference on a night when Southampton lost their third successive fixture (Manchester City and Arsenal were the other two).

Working alongside Rooney, who has taken complete responsibility for the words of encouragement during the game to his strike partner, they suddenly appear to be a formidable partnership.

Undoubtedly they work better together when they Louis van Gaal dispenses with the nonsense of who is ‘nine’ and who is ‘10’. They were made to play together and their relationship benefited as a result. His first goal was a deft finish and so was his second, arriving at the back stick to meet Rooney’s accurate 71st minute free-kick.

It was there that he ran straight toward the thousands of travelling United supporters chanting ‘Louis van Gaal’s red and white army’ throughout the second half.

Make no mistake, Van Persie is one of them again.
