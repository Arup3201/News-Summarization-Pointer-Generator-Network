England got the result they desperately needed against Samoa but Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff did not get the performance they desired. 

Michael Cheika will bring his wounded Wallabies to Twickenham next week for England's final game of the autumn international series and serious improvement is needed if Lancaster's troops are to take a prized southern hemisphere scalp in November. 

Here, Sportsmail looks at five things England learned from the match. 

ENGLAND'S FORWARDS PACK A PUNCH 

England's attack may lack fluency and tempo, but their set piece remains one of the best in the world. 

England's lineout, bar a few late blips, operated beautifully again on Saturday night with Rob Webber hitting his targets with ease. Bath lock Dave Attwood continues to impress and did not take a backward step against the ultra-physical Samoan forwards.

The scrum remains a huge weapon for England going forward with young props Kieran Brookes and Matt Mullan providing huge impact off the bench.  

England's scrum was once again outstanding and squeezed vital penalties out of the Samoan pack 

FORD CAN GIVE ENGLAND FOCUS  

George Ford was picked by Stuart Lancaster to give England more direction out wide and the Bath fly half certainly delivered a promising performance. 

Ford's wraparound with Owen Farrell created the space for Jonny May's opening try while his pin-point cross-kick allowed Anthony Watson to put Mike Brown over in the right corner.  

Ford is made of tough stuff as well. The young number 10 copped several big hits including a huge tackle from Samoa lock Filo Paulo early in the contest and bounced straight back up after Jonny Leota's thundering tackle in the second half.

ENGLAND'S MIDFIELD IS STILL A CENTRAL ISSUE 

Farrell and Brad Barritt were solid but unspectacular against Samoa. Granted, conditions were difficult and the Samoans put in a monstrous defensive effort but Lancaster still has major issues in midfield. 

Farrell had an indifferent night and was substituted for Billy Twelvetrees in the 64th minute. Barritt could be England's answer at inside centre but does not have the acceleration or creativity to make inroads in the outside channels. 

Manu Tuilagi remains England's premier attacking three-quarter and there is no doubt that Lancaster will be keeping an eye on Luther Burrell's progress following his recent return from injury.

CHRIS ROBSHAW IS STILL ENGLAND'S MAIN MAN

Chris Robshaw has come in for some staunch criticism in recent weeks. The Harlequins skipper has often been pilloried for his breakdown skills and ball carrying impact. Many feel Robshaw is not in the same league as out and out 'fetchers' such as Richie McCaw, Michael Hooper and Schalk Burger in terms of the dark arts of openside play. 

Against a powerful Samoan backrow, Robshaw excelled and rightfully took home the Man of the Match award. The England skipper also topped the tackle charts with 21 hits and outshone his fellow backrowers Ben Morgan and James Haskell.

ENGLAND HAVE THE PACK AND HALF-BACKS TO BEAT AUSTRALIA 

England can round off a disappointing November series and defeat the Wallabies next Saturday but only if Stuart Lancaster goes back to basics. 

England have admirably sought to evolve their game in the last 12 months but if Lancaster's side implement their 'all-court' game against Australia, they will be ripped to shreds. 

The Wallabies caused Ireland all sorts of problems when they injected tempo into their play and have an arsenal of outside backs who can hurt England. 

If England keep it tight, pick Ford and Ben Youngs at half-back and play the percentages, they can strangle the Wallabies at Twickenham.  

England have the forward muscle and the set-piece to strangle a suspect Wallabies pack next Saturday
