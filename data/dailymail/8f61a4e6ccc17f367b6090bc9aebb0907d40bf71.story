The Deputy Prime Minister said the Coalition policy was a crucial step to ensure mental health problems were treated as seriously as physical ones

Peoplewith mental illness should feel as comfortable talking about it as they do talking about a sprained ankle, Nick Clegg will say today.

From April, patients who need counselling will be guaranteed it within a time limit of 18 weeks, the same as for surgical procedures, he will announce.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the Coalition policy was a crucial step to ensure mental health problems were treated as seriously as physical ones.

Another £120million will be put into improving treatment provision on the health service in England, for which there are no currently time limits.

Under the plans, someone experiencing psychosis for the first time – which includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression – would be referred for treatment within two weeks, the same as for cancer treatment.

At least one in four people experience a mental health problem during their lives, which costs the economy about £100 billion a year in lost productivity and hospital admissions.

Mr Clegg will say: ‘While I have nothing but praise for the tremendous work of NHS staff, the system is still letting patients down.

‘It’s wrong that relatives and friends needing a hip operation can expect treatment within a clear timeframe but someone with a debilitating mental health condition has no clarity about when they will get help.’

Mr Clegg is also making mental health treatment a priority for his own party. In his conference speech today, he will slam the ‘Cinderella’ treatment of conditions such as eating disorders, depression and self-harm.

Former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno revealed he had been sectioned twice in the past 18 months because of mental health problems

‘I want this to be a country where a young dad chatting at the school gates will feel as comfortable discussing anxiety, stress, depression as the mum who’s explaining how she sprained her ankle’, he will say.

In a video shown at the conference in Glasgow yesterday, former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno revealed he had been sectioned twice in the past 18 months because of mental health problems.

He said: ‘My name is Frank Bruno and I’m talking from experience of being sectioned about three times – two times in the last 18 months.

‘I’m just a nobody really, I’m just a human being. Yesterday I used to do boxing and I used to be a celebrity, but I’m talking to you as a human being from experience.’

Mr Bruno recorded the video to introduce a speech by Health Minister Norman Lamb, who told the conference: ‘Frank Bruno came to talk to me about his experience.

‘He talked about the acute embarrassment and humiliation of three marked police cars arriving at his house – as if a dreadful crime had been committed. But he was ill.

‘And so many people end up completely inappropriately in police cells. It is an outrage. Just imagine being very ill.

'Perhaps in a state of enormous anxiety. And then you are locked up in a cell. It’s inhuman.’

Simon Stevens, NHS England’s chief executive, said yesterday’s announcement on waiting times was an ‘important moment’ and the extra money would ‘bring parity of esteem for mental health services a step closer.’

If his party gets into power, Mr Clegg has promised to put another £1billion per year into the NHS budget in real terms, by scrapping some tax breaks.
