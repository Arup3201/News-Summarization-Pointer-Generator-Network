There was no doubt who won the hearts of the Centre Court crowd yesterday – but despite the support of spectators and her Royal namesake, ‘Princess of Wimbledon’ Eugenie Bouchard had to content herself with the runners-up trophy.

The stunning young Canadian – watched by the real Princess Eugenie in the Royal box – lost the Ladies’ Singles final to Petra Kvitova in straight sets.

After the match, 20-year-old Bouchard – whose royalist mother Julie named her and her twin sister after Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice and their brother after Prince William – said she wished she could have put on a better performance.

Eugenie – who was also supported by 
sitcom star Jim Parsons from the Big Bang Theory in the players’ box – 
was blown away by the explosive power of the Czech six-footer in 
straight sets.

After the match Bouchard spoke about what it was like being watched on court by her Royal namesake. She said: ‘That was crazy. I did see her in the box. I’m very happy that she came out.

'Disappointed I couldn’t put on a better show for her, but I’d love to meet her, of course. It’s the only person I’m named after. She’s the only one in the world. Hopefully I’ll get a chance to meet her.’

Throughout the match Bouchard was cheered on by the Princess, who was not as generous in her applause for Kvitova – who previously won the Wimbledon title in 2011.

After a thrilling rally won by Kvitova, the Princess sat with her head in her hands.

Before the match, a Buckingham  
Palace spokesman said: ‘Princess Eugenie has decided to attend Wimbledon
 today at the last minute. She is going to support Eugenie.’

Afterwards,
 the spokesman said: ‘Princess Eugenie was delighted to be able to 
attend the Wimbledon final and see the game.

'A last-minute change of 
plans made it possible. HRH sends her congratulations to both players.’

After the game, a crowd  gathered in the rain on Murray Mound, shouting, ‘Genie, we still love you.’

Miss Bouchard said: ‘It’s really special to hear that people want me to do well and believe in me. On court today I felt some special support from the crowd.  It’s humbling.’

She revealed that in the five-minute 
break between losing the match and picking up the runner-up’s trophy, 
she was made to sit  in the room with the engraver. 

She
 said: ‘It was cruel, a little odd. I sat down. I put my jacket on. Just
 reflected. I was in the engraver’s room, so I was watching them work, 
wishing one day, dreaming that he’ll write my name somewhere.’

She
 added she was looking forward to eating ‘comfort food... I’ll 
definitely have dessert tonight. I haven’t had dessert in a while, so 
I’ll have some brownie or something.’

But
 despite yesterday’s swift defeat, tennis insiders forecast that the 
photogenic Ms Bouchard has a golden future and if her tennis keeps 
improving, she could even outshine Maria Sharapova who is estimated to 
be worth around £52.5 million.

Debate: The female winners get the same prize money as the males, but play less time

Brave: Bouchard was runner-up but lasted just 55 minutes in the Wimbledon women's final
