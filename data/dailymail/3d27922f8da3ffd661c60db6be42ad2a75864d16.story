An Olympic silver medalist who won titles around the world in triple jump events has been charged with drink-driving.

Phillips Idowu, 34, was pulled over by police in Epping, Essex, while he was allegedly almost three times the drink-drive limit.

Idowu, who won the silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a European gold medal in 2010, is currently on bail ahead of an appearance at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Champion: Idowu, pictured here in action at the 2011 Athletics world championship in Korea, was allegedly stopped while at almost triple the drink-drive limit

He gave a breath sample to police after they pulled him over in his white Land Rover at 10am. The sample showed he had 96 micrograms 
of alcohol in 100ml of breath, according to papers filed with the court.

The figure is almost three times the legal limit of 35 micrograms per 100ml of breath.

Idowu was arrested on 20 September and charged with drink-driving.

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed that he had been charged.

He said: 'A man is due to appear in court 
charged with drink driving after he was stopped by police on Bridge 
Hill, Epping, shortly before 10am on Friday September 20.

Decorated: Idowu, pictured left receiving his MBE in 2011 and right posing as a member of Team GB ahead of London 2012, is a world-class athlete

'Phillips
Idowu, 34, unemployed, of Crossing Road, Epping, has been bailed to 
appear before Chelmsford Magistrates Court on Monday October 7.'

The athlete has a string of victories to his name, though he failed to make it past the qualifying rounds of the London Olympics last year.

He has five gold medals to his name, including the 2009 World Championship, 2010 European Championshipand 2006 Commonwealth games.

Idowuâ€™s management agency declined to comment on the allegations.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
