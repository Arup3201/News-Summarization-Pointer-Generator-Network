A leather coat belonging to Adolf Hitler's architect was bought for more than $10,000 - by the man's Jewish cousin.

The coat, belonging to Albert Speer,  was sold at an auction in Los Angeles last week alongside autographed copies of Hitler's hate-filled autobiography Mein Kampf.

It was bought by Jason 
Speer, a successful businessman who lives near Chicago who was also Albert Speer's third cousin, he said he was 'proud' to keep the jacket in the family.　

A label inside the coat depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite. Also included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed on it

Speer (right with Hitler center) was well known for his leather coat. The coat came with a note from a U.S. serviceman explaining how he found it

Speer was the Fuhrer’s chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War Production who escaped the death penalty at Nuremberg by acknowledging Nazi war crimes while denying any part in them. Instead he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

'I was amazed that Albert Speer admitted
 his guilt, served time, and repented for what he did,' said Mr Speer.

'I want him to 
be remembered for his amazing architecture and for what his role was in 
Germany during World War II. This item is of great significance, and I 
am proud to keep it in the Speer family.'

Jason, the son of a Jewish mother and a Christian father, said he was 'thrilled' to get the jacket adding: 'This is a fantastic piece of history. I am a great admirer of Albert Speer’s architecture, especially the Volkshalle - People’s Hall - in Berlin.'　

He learned of his link to the prominent Nazi when his grandfather traced his lineage back to Albert Speer when he was stationed with the U.S. Army in Germany.

Speer wore the coat when he visited Hitler for the last time on April 23, 1945.

Sewn inside the overcoat are labels bearing Speer’s name, the brand name of W. Fliegner and the initials of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the German regulatory office for quality control in manufacturing.

The label depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite.

Included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed on it, found stored in the coat’s pocket.

Hitler killed himself in the Berlin bunker along with his new bride Eva Braun on April 30 1945. Speer ignored the orders given to him by Hitler at their last meeting to destroy all German infrastructure and industry to prevent them being used by the Russians and the Allies.　

After the war, the coat was seized by an Allied soldier named 'Ralph,' who wrote a letter to his mother about his adventures. Dated May 6, 1945, the letter mentions that he 'looked around today in a huge chalet of a high-ranking Nazi.

'For you, I have a gold necklace. 'And for Dad, I have a great leather jacket...I took a coat with no Nazi symbols on the outside...Unfortunately, the name of Nazi Albert Speer is stamped in the jacket...''

Two rare copies of Mein Kampf signed by Adolf Hitler were also auctioned last week in Los Angeles

The signed two-volume set - a first edition and a second edition - of the future German Fuehrer's political manifesto were sold on Thursday February 26
