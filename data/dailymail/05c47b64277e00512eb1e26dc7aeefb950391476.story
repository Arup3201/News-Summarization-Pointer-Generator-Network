The U.S. Army private accused of releasing diplomatic cables and secret documents to website WikiLeaks has pleaded guilty to misusing classified material but denied the most serious charge in the case of aiding the enemy.

Private First Class Bradley Manning, 25, entered guilty pleas to 10 of 22 charges on Thursday while also revealing his feeling of accomplishment when he released the classified information in the biggest leak of government secrets in U.S. history.

'I believe that if the general public 
... had access to the information ... this could spark a domestic debate
as to the role of the military and foreign policy in general,' Manning,
dressed in full military uniform, testified calmly.

Pleas: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, seen in June of 2012, has pleaded not guilty to aiding the enemy at a military hearing and pleaded guilty to lesser charges that he misused classified data

Reading from a 35-page statement as 
he remained seated next to his lawyers, the short, slight private 
described his feelings of relief after uploading the first batch of documents from a Barnes and Noble bookstore in Rockville, 
Maryland.

'I felt I accomplished something that
would allow me to have a clear conscience,' said Manning, who spoke 
under oath for more than an hour.

In addition, Manning said that he was
appalled by 2007 combat video of an assault by a U.S. helicopter that 
killed 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer.

The Pentagon concluded the troops mistook the camera equipment for weapons.

'I take full responsibility for my actions.'

'I believe that if the general public ... had access to the information ... this could spark a domestic debate as to the role of the military and foreign policy in general.'

Feelings after submitting top secret information to WikiLeaks:

'I felt I accomplished something that would allow me to have a clear conscience.'

On the 2007 combat video of U.S. helicopter assault that killed 11 in Iraq:

'The most alarming aspect of the video to me was the seemingly delightful bloodlust the aerial weapons team happened to have.'

Regarding State Department cables he leaked:

'In many ways, these cables are a catalogue of cliques and gossip.'

What motivated him to initially leak documents:

'I felt we were risking for so much for people ... unwilling to cooperate with us. I began to become depressed.'

Referring to investigative items that Iraq Federal Police shared with the U.S. Army regarding possible political opponents of now Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki:

'I always want to figure out the truth.'

'The most alarming aspect of the video to me was the seemingly delightful bloodlust the aerial weapons team happened to have,' Manning said, adding that the soldiers' actions 'seemed similar to a child torturing ants with a magnifying glass.'

As for the State Department cables, he said they 'documented backdoor deals and criminality that didn't reflect the so-called leader of the free world.'

'I thought these cables were a prime example of the need for a more open diplomacy,' Manning said.

'I believed that these cables would not damage the United States. However, I believed these cables would be embarrassing.'

Manning also revealed that he 
first tried sending his classified documents to the New York Times, 
Washington Post and Politico before turning to WikiLeaks, according to a reporter Tweeting from the courtroom.

'Bradley Manning contacted New York 
Times and left message it was very important. He had information. He 
left email/Skype address. No response,' tweeted Firedoglake reporter Kevin Gosztola.

'Bradley Manning tried to contact POLITICO to give them war logs. Weather conditions hampered travel to office,' he wrote.

'Manning said he talked to person at WaPo who he did not think took him seriously when he described war logs.'

According to the New York Times' report, Manning said he tried a number at their office and left a message for the public editor, an ombudsman, who is not part of the newsroom.

At the hearing, Manning pleaded not guilty to the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, through his attorney.

Manning said 'No one associated with WikiLeaks pressured me into sending more information.'

Manning, who has been jailed at 
Quantico Marine Base in Virginia for more than 1,000 days, could face 
life imprisonment if convicted of that charge.

Washington Post: Manning also told the court he spoke with someone at the Washington Post who didn't take his offer seriously

Politico: The U.S. Army private also said he tried to give his war logs to Politico but was unable due to weather conditions

He pleaded guilty to a series of 10 lesser charges that he misused classified information at the hearing before military judge Colonel Denise Lind.

He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for those charges.

Under a ruling last month by Lind, 
Manning would have any sentence reduced by 112 days to compensate for 
the markedly harsh treatment he received during his confinement.

While 
at Quantico, Manning was placed in solitary confinement for up to 23 
hours a day with guards checking on him every few minutes.

Manning admitted to unauthorized 
possession and willful communication of information from military 
databases, including the Combined Information Data Network Exchange Iraq
and Combined Information Data Network Exchange Afghanistan.

He
also admitted to misuse of documents from the U.S. Southern Command 
pertaining to Guantanamo Bay, a memo from an unnamed intelligence 
agency, and records from a military operation in Farah province in 
Afghanistan.

Manning, an Army intelligence analyst, was arrested in May 2010 while serving in Iraq and charged with downloading thousands of intelligence documents, diplomatic cables and combat videos and forwarding them to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks began exposing the U.S. government secrets in the same year, stunning diplomats around the world and outraging U.S. officials who said damage to national security from the leaks endangered U.S. lives.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since June to avoid extradition to Sweden for alleged sex crimes.

WikiLeaks has been careful never to confirm or deny Manning was the source of the documents.

Reached by telephone in Britain on Thursday, Assange would not say whether he had any dealings with Manning but called him a political prisoner and said his prosecution was part of an effort by the U.S. to clamp down on criticism of its military and foreign policy.

Assange himself remains under investigation by the U.S. and has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for the better part of a year to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex-crimes allegations.
