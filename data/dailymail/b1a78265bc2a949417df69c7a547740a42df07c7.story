A model who suffered years of being teased about her height has beaten her bullies to become a Naomi Campbell lookalike.

Lystra Adams was constantly picked on by her classmates for being 'too tall and nerdy' but now says she can't leave the house without being stopped for autographs. 

The 37-year-old was bullied while at school in Montserrat and the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that used to suffer panic attacks before going to class.

But Lystra, who lives in Staffordshire, has since conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel's lookalike.

The model says that she could never have imagined such a turnaround after her bullies had left her confidence at an all-time low. 

'I was constantly bullied at school - I was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys, let alone girls my age, and I wore these thick glasses.

As a child Lystra, pictured left, had always towered over her school friends and had worn thick glasses but after growing up, right, and moving to Halifax people constantly remarked on her likeness to Naomi

Lystra says she can rarely walk down the street without being stopped for autographs 

'This one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like "freak" and "nerd" and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back.'

Lystra says that the jibes may have sounded tame but as a child they had really taken their toll. 

'It doesn't sound much, but when you're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school.

'It was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all I think now is look at me now!'

When people first remarked on Lystra's resemblance to Naomi (right) she had no idea who the supermodel was but after looking her up Lystra signed up to an agency and never looked back 

Lystra says that since Naomi has been less of a diva she has seen her bookings slow down 

In 1997, at the age of 20, Lystra moved from Montserrat to Yorkshire at the height of Naomi Campbell's catwalk career.

The town of Halifax was a far cry from the runways of  Paris, Milan and New York - but was still stared at in the street.

Astonishingly, at that time Lystra had no idea who the supermodel was so could not work out why she was receiving so much attention.

'When all these people stared at me I thought there was something wrong with me!

As well as being approached by fans, Lystra says she has received a few negative comments when being mistaken for Naomi

'I had no clue until one day, about a year after I'd arrived, this woman came up to me and told me I looked like Naomi Campbell.

'I just said "Who?" but when I looked it up I was flattered and started doing lookalike work.'

Soon after noticing her resemblance to Naomi, Lystra put her career into motion and has never looked back. 

'I signed up with the Model Bank modelling agency in Birmingham, and I have been in work ever since.' 

For the past 15 years Lystra has been hired to turn up at functions and events in stretch limos and be 'papped' on the red carpet.

Lystra even claims that at one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards, who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet.

As the supermodel - the first black model to cover French Vogue in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press, lookalike work has slowed for Lystra.

'She's been a bit less of a diva recently though - I need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in!'

Still Lystra says she is stopped in the street on the daily - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter Jasmine, 13. 

'There isn't a day goes by where I'm not told I look like her - if I had a pound for every time that happened I'd have as much money as her!

'Whenever we go on holiday I'm always stopped for autographs - it probably doesn't help that I'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva!

'I had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after I told her I wasn't Naomi.'

As well as admiration Lystra says that her likeness to the super model has seen her deal with some negative comments. 

'On the other hand, another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she didn't believe I wasn't Naomi and said I was lying and being a b**** and a diva!

'Sometimes I just can't win, but I try not to complain - there are worse people to look like!'
