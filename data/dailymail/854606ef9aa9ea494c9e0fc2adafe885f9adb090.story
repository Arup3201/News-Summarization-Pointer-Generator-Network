A grandmother who has worked in a laundry room for more than 30 years is believed to have ironed an incredible 1.1million items of clothing.

Val Robson, 56, only intended to cover a two-week maternity absence at Middleton Hall Retirement Village near Darlington back in 1983 - but ended up staying on.

Three decades later she says she still loves her job and can't wait to see endless baskets of laundry disappear.

Full steam ahead: Grandmother Val Robson is still ironing clothes every day after 30 years in the business

Mrs Robson puts on 30 washes and irons more than 180 items a day - but it doesn't mean she gets out of doing her own.

She says she still finds the energy on a Friday evening to press her own clothes, as long as she has a glass of red wine and a Westlife CD on.

She said: 'I came for a fortnight to cover someone on maternity leave and I've been here ever since.

'I get a lot of job satisfaction from coming in on a morning and seeing rows of empty baskets, and then seeing them all full of fresh, clean clothes when I've finished. I never stop.

'It's go, go, go all the time - but it keeps me fit.

'A million pieces seems like a huge amount of ironing but I don't really think about it, I just crack on. It sounds silly to most people but I love my job.

Despite having ironed an estimated 1.1million items of clothing in her career, Mrs Robson still does her own pile of ironing at home on a Friday night

'I think most people wouldn't want to see the ironing board again if they did it for a living, but I don't mind at all.

'It's my Friday evening sorted - a pile of ironing, a glass of wine and Westlife.'

Jeremy Walford, the Village's managing director, who awarded her a bouquet of flowers and a meal for two, said: 'Val is one of our longest-serving employees and her work ethos and dedication to our residents is fantastic.

'She has so much energy and a pride for what she does.

'No one can get through the laundry as fast as Val and she always ensures the quality is there too.'
