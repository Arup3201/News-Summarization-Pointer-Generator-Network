'Historic step': David Cameron says the reforms 'will change lives for the better'

David Cameron today hailed an 'historic step' in ending Britain's benefits culture as the Government's flagship Welfare Reform Bill finally became law.

The Prime Minister said the measures to curb welfare dependency would help get people back to work and start to turn around the something-for-nothing culture encouraged by Labour.

The Welfare Reform Bill cleared its final hurdle in the Lords last night despite bitter opposition from Labour and some Church of England bishops.

The legislation brings in a £26,000-a-year cap on the total amount of benefits any family can claim and introduces new curbs to a number of long-term benefits.

The Prime Minister said: 'Today marks an historic step in the biggest welfare revolution in over 60 years.

'These reforms will change lives for the better, giving people the help they need, while backing individual responsibility so that they can escape poverty, not be trapped in it.

'Past governments have talked about reform, while watching the benefits bill sky-rocket and generations languish on the dole and dependency. This Government is delivering it.

'Our new law will mark the end of the culture that said a life on benefits was an acceptable alternative to work.'

The Prime Minister paid tribute to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who faced fierce criticism from charities and pressure groups to water down the legislation.

He added: 'We've stood up against the abuse that left taxpayers footing the bills for people on £30,000 or even £50,000 a year in benefits.

'It's a fair principle: a family out of work on benefits shouldn't be paid more than the average family in work.

'This is a core part of the Government's task of turning around the legacy of debt, overspending and waste we inherited.

'We want money to go to people who need it, not subsidising the consequences of our broken society. By reforming welfare we will get people into fulfilling jobs - not abandon them to poverty and dependency - save billions of pounds of taxpayers' money and make sure those who really need help get it.'

The Bill had a stormy passage through the Lords, with peers inflicting seven defeats on the Government when the legislation was first considered and a further one after MPs had overturned all the setbacks.

The most prominent came when the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds John Packer led a move to exempt child benefit from the £26,000 cap.

Tory MP David Davies today pointed out that the Church of England pays its bishops' chauffeurs significantly less than the £26,000 still on offer to some benefits claimants.

MPs were told that the Church's 19 drivers are employed at a total cost of £352,719 - an average of £18,500.

Mr Davies said the clergy were morally obliged to pay their drivers at least as much as a household can receive in benefits.

The Monmouth MP said: 'The Welfare Reform Bill has just become an Act.'Those bishops who voted against this, who voted to ensure people who are not working should earn more than £26,000, should now feel a moral imperative to pay their chauffeurs accordingly.'

Conservative Tony Baldry, representing the Church Commissioners, said being driven around 'helps ensure the best use of bishops' time'.
