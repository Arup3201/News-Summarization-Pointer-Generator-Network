Philomena Lee, who was forced to give up her three-year-old son for adoption wrote to the New York Post after its critic slammed a movie based on her life story

The woman whose search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption inspired the film Philomena has slammed a U.S. critic who branded it 'anti-Catholic and anti-Republican'.

Philomena, which stars Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, tells the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish woman who was forced by nuns to give up her three-year-old son Anthony having fallen pregnant as a teenager.

After keeping silent about her loss for 50 years she tells her story to journalist Martin Sixsmith, played by Coogan, and the pair travel to America in an attempt to trace Anthony. 

In a scathing review in the New York Post, Kyle Smith described the film as '90 minutes of organised hate', 
the sole purpose of which was to 'simultaneously attack Catholics and 
Republicans'.

He brands the key characters as a 'ninny and a jerk' and goes on to describe the film as 'a sugary slice of arsenic cake'.

But
the review prompted Ms Lee to write to Smith in support of the film 
arguing that he had had missed the point entirely and pointing out that,
despite her experience, she is a proud Catholic.

Ms
Lee's letter, which was placed as full-page advert in the New York 
Times by the film's producer Harvey Weinstein, states the movie is 
supposed to be a 'testament to good things, not an attack'. 

She writes: 'Your review of the movie paints its story as being a condemnation of Catholicism and conservative views.

'It
states that the relationship depicted between Mr. Martin Sixsmith and 
myself comes across as contrived and trite, and funny for all the wrong 
reasons. Forgive me for saying so, Kyle, but you are incorrect.

'What
Stephen Frears did with Martin’s book is something extraordinary and 
quite real. Stephen’s take on the story of Martin and me searching for 
my long lost son, who I hadn’t spoken of to a single soul in fifty 
years, has overwhelmingly spoken to those who have seen it in a very 
positive light.

'For that I am intensely grateful, not just because people the world over have watched the movie with open hearts and embraced me for coming forward with the truth after all this time.

'The story it tells has resonated with people not because it’s some mockery of ideas or institutions that they’re in disagreement with.

'This is not a rally cry against the 
church or politics. In fact, despite some of the troubles that befell me
as a young girl, I have always maintained a very strong hold on my 
faith.'

The film is based on Martin Sixsmith's book Philomena, which charts his and Ms Lee's four year hunt to trace Anthony.

He described the film, written by Coogan 
and director Stephen Frears as 'beautifully wrought' and 'steering a 
path between affecting pathos and laugh-out-loud humour'.

Speaking exclusively to the Mail earlier 
this year, Ms Lee explained how she was sent off to work in a Catholic 
laundry just eight weeks after giving birth.

She described heartbreaking moment that she found out her son was being given up for adoption from one of the few nuns she considered a friend.

She said: 'I didn’t even have a chance to give him a last cuddle. I saw his little face looking out of the back window of the black car that was taking him away. That’s never left me, that image, in all my years.

'I was there when they filmed that scene for the movie and it was exactly how I remembered it. The director Stephen Frears said: "What are you doing here today, are you mad?" I did shed a tear. Awful. Awful.

'After Anthony was taken, oh, I cried and caused a right carry on. The nuns told me to shut up and to stop being stupid and that I was lucky I had my baby adopted.'

The film has also prompted an angry response from the order of nuns, he Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in County Tipperary, who claim they were made to look like ‘villains’.

Sister Julie Rose, the order’s assistant congregational leader, said the film ‘does not tell the whole truth, and in many ways is very misleading’.
