Keeping secrets: Lord Chris Patten is facing calls to quit over payouts

The BBC was at the centre of a fresh pay row last night as MPs demanded it name 150 fatcats who pocketed huge payoffs.

It has fought to keep the recipients’ identities secret, citing data protection issues.

But the influential Public Accounts Committee is to use its powers to force the broadcaster to hand over the list of names.

Many of the former staff affected by the move are said to be furious that their payouts could be revealed publicly.

The news comes amid speculation that the BBC Trust – its governing body – could be axed.

Former director-general Mark Thompson and Trust chairman Lord Patten face a grilling by the committee today, with both men blaming each other over who was responsible for lavishing licence payers’ money on the generous payoffs.

The showdown is expected to result in calls for Lord Patten to quit and for the Trust to be reformed or even scrapped.

Senior BBC managers received a total of £25milion in severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, a National Audit Office report found.

With the corporation in a state of near civil war, the BBC has  written to 150 former managers warning them that their severance arrangements may be  made public.

Referring to the NAO report, the BBC’s letter said: ‘PAC has recently confirmed in writing to the BBC that it is applying its Standing Order power to call for the 150 names and details of the 150 recipients of severance payments cited in the report, which includes you.’

Facing off: Former director-general Mark Thompson and Lord Patten blame each other over who was responsible for the generous payoffs

One of the 150 fatcats is thought to be Peter Fincham, the former BBC1 controller who walked away in 2007 with £500,000 after resigning over the so-called Crowngate scandal.

Mr Fincham, who is now ITV director of TV, wrongly told the Press at a screening that the Queen walked out of a photoshoot featured in a royal documentary ‘in a huff’.

It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited and that his account was untrue.

However some among the 150 ex-staff believe they are being unfairly targeted.

One former senior manager said: ‘The concern I would have is that a senior manager such as myself, whose redundancy settlement was perfectly in order, will be lumped together with the very small number of senior managers whose deals seem to have been rather more generous.’
