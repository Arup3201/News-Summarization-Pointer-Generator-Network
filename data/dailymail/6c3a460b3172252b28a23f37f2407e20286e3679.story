Luis Enrique took his first training session as the new manager of Barcelona on Tuesday.

Minus a significant number of World Cup stars, former Barca player Enrique looked in relaxed mood as he put a young squad through their paces.

German goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, a summer arrival from Borussia Monchengladbach, was the biggest name to take part.

Gerard Deulofeu, who spent last season on loan at Everton, was also present at Barca's Ciutat Esportiva complex.

Enrique was handed the Nou Camp reins after the club parted company with Argentinian manager Gerardo Martino at the end of last season.

Martino failed to deliver a trophy in his only season in charge following on from a highly successful period under Pep Guardiola and the late Tito Vilanova.

Enrique - a 62-cap Spain international - spent eight years at the Nou Camp as a player from 1996 to 2004.

He started his coaching career at Barcelona B in 2008 before an unsuccessful stint at Roma.

Enrique guided Celta Vigo to a ninth-placed finish in La Liga last season before Barca came calling.
