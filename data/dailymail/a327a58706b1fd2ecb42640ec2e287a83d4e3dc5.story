Nigel Farage was accused of hypocrisy yesterday over Ukip’s ‘racist’ EU immigration campaign posters because he employs his German wife as his secretary.

But as senior figures from the three main parties attacked his party’s latest publicity drive, the Ukip leader insisted that no British person could do the taxpayer-funded job taken by his second wife, Kirsten.

The anti-EU party is using a £1.5million donation from a multi-millionaire businessman to launch a poster campaign for next month’s European elections focused on immigration from the Continent.

'So, whose job is Kirsten taking?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage is asked by the BBC's Nick Robinson whether his German wife is taking a British worker's job, in light of the eurosceptic party's latest ad campaign

Secretary: Kirsten Farage, pictured last year, works for her husband in an EU-funded role

The most controversial billboard 
carries a warning that 26million are unemployed across Europe, and asks:
 ‘Whose job are they after?’ with a large hand pointing at the observer.

Ukip’s opponents have likened the posters to those used in the past by the far-Right British National Party.

Mr
 Farage yesterday dismissed the criticism as ‘nonsense’, but ran into 
trouble when he was confronted by the BBC’s Nick Robinson over his 
employment of his publicity-shy German wife as his secretary using EU 
allowances.

‘She came here as a highly skilled person earning a high salary paying a very large amount of tax,’ the Ukip leader insisted.

‘I
 don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going
 through emails and getting me briefed for the next day. 

‘It’s
 a very different situation to a mass of hundreds of thousands of people
 coming in and flooding the lower end of the labour market.’ 

Asked
 whether a British person could take the position as his secretary, Mr 
Farage said: ‘Nobody else could do that job, not unless they were 
married to me.’

Mr Farage 
said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage, of up to £30,000 a year, and 
worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week.

'Nobody else could do that job': Mr Farage gave a stout defence of his wife's EU taxpayer-funded role

Mr Farage faced embarrassment yesterday after it emerged that a woman posing as a voter in Ukip’s manifesto actually works for him.

Lizzy Vaid (right) appears in a full-page photograph as a voter from Devon, with a large quote stating: ‘I’ll be voting Ukip because they’re the only party listening to what people want.’

But Miss Vaid, who is half Indian, works in London and on her Twitter account she describes herself as ‘Ukip Events Manager and Assistant to Nigel Farage, as well as a lover of social occasions’.

He pointed out that one in four MPs at Westminster and more than 70 other British Euro MPs also employ a close family member.

Tory
 former defence minister Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston 
Churchill, became the first senior member of his party to attack the 
poster campaign, funded by internet and property tycoon Paul Sykes.

His
 intervention was seen as significant because he chairs a cross-party 
group on migration which is often critical of government policy.

‘At
 a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip 
advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant,’ Mr 
Soames said.

Labour MP Mike
 Gapes, former chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, had 
already said that he hoped the ‘racist posters encourage all decent 
British Commonwealth and EU citizens’ to vote for another party in the 
European elections on May 22.

Speech: Ukip leader Nigel Farage launches his party's European election bilboard campaign in Sheffield

Polish workers who arrived in Britain to pick fruit have graduated to better jobs and now feel fully ‘at home’ here – with some even joining Ukip, the country’s ambassador revealed yesterday.

Witold Sobkow (right) said that, initially, his countrymen and women were doing low-skilled jobs when they moved to Britain after Poland joined the EU in 2004.

But they have now learned English, obtained qualifications in UK schools and colleges and won ‘promotion’ to better jobs. Some had become involved in British politics.

In an interview with the Independent, Poland’s ambassador to London said: ‘There are some relatively young people from Poland who are members of Ukip and they have this group, Friends of Poland in Ukip.’

But he insisted he was not condemning those planning to vote for Ukip in the European elections but the party’s poster campaign.

‘I
 stand by my view that this is a racist, xenophobic campaign designed to
 win votes by whipping up animosity against foreigners living and 
working and contributing to this country,’ he said.

Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron said the posters were ‘wrong not just factually but morally’.

Former
 Labour activist Dan Hodges said Ukip was ‘worse’ than the BNP, which 
was now ‘finished’ as a political force. ‘The BNP were racist, but at 
least they had the courage to be open about their racism,’ he added.

Ukip’s deputy leader, Paul Nuttall, said Labour MPs were trying to close down a debate over immigration ‘by shouting racist’.

He
 said: ‘The fact of the matter is that we’ve got wage compression in 
this country, we’ve got uncontrolled borders. And the only way we’re 
going to get control of our borders is by leaving this club [the EU].’

UKIP yesterday unveiled four posters for next month’s European elections, which immediately sparked allegations of ‘racism’ from the party’s opponents. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK investigates the claims made by the controversial posters.

CLAIM: 75 per cent of our laws are now made in Brussels.

REALITY: No simple answer. Ukip’s estimate is based on figures produced by ex-European Parliament president Hans-Gert Pottering.

Viviane Reding, an EU Commissioner, recently put the figure closer to 70 per cent. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed in a TV debate with Nigel Farage that it is only 7 per cent.

The independent House of Commons Library says ‘it is possible to justify any measure between 15 and 50 per cent’. It depends on whether the figures include only primary legislation passed by the UK Parliament, or all laws and regulations influenced by, or related to, Brussels.

CLAIM: The United Kingdom pays £55million a day to the European Union and its Eurocrats.

REALITY: Technically accurate. The figure – the equivalent of £20billion a year – is roughly what the British Government paid to EU institutions in 2012.

However, the UK does get around £8billion of this money back in the form of the rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and other payments, such as subsidies to farmers.

This still leaves the UK making a net contribution of around £12billion a year, or £33million a day.

CLAIM: British workers are hit hard by EU policy that allows unlimited cheap labour.

REALITY: Last month a Government report concluded that ‘there is evidence for some labour market displacement in recent years when the economy was in recession’, with the low-skilled most likely to lose out.

The Migration Advisory Committee found that for every 100 extra foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK, there was a reduction of 23 in the number of Britons in employment.

Labour and the Tories have made similar comments to the Ukip poster in recent weeks.

The poster carries a warning that 26 million unemployed people across Europe are 'after' UK jobs

CLAIM: 26million people in Europe are looking for work.

REALITY: There were 25.622million people unemployed across the EU in February, according to EU figures. This includes the 2.2million unemployed people in Britain, most of whom are British citizens.

Of course, not every jobseeker in Europe plans to move to the UK. But, as the eurozone continues to struggle, the UK has become an increasingly popular destination for workers from southern Europe.

Last year, National Insurance numbers were issued to 51,000 Spaniards, 44,000 Italians and 30,000 Portuguese. Ministers have blamed the upturn in EU immigration to Britain for the increase in net migration, which currently stands at 212,000 a year.

Married man: Nigel Farage has previously said that his wife Kirsten's 'brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance'

Hamburg-born Kirsten Farage, née Mehr, keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience.

The Ukip leader has previously said of the moment he met Kirsten: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance.

'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’

Kirsten, 49, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and do her husband’s correspondence.

She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers.

She is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him.

She works from home and rarely visits Ukip’s HQ in London’s Mayfair, which she has described as a ‘freak show’.
