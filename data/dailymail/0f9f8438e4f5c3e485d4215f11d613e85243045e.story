Emma Kirsopp, 38, (pictured concealing her face outside South Tyneside Magistrates' Court) pleaded guilty to being drunk while in charge of her child

A drunken mother who was spotted swigging from a bottle of vodka while pushing a pram with her two-year-old son in has been spared jail.

Emma Kirsopp, 38, was pushing the youngster in his buggy along a road in South Shields when a concerned member of the public contacted police to say the woman could barely walk.

When officers arrived at the scene the mother - who could hardly talk or stand - was arrested and the toddler was placed under police protection.

Kirsopp pleaded guilty to being drunk in a public place while in charge of a child - for the second time in a year – when she appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday.

Handing her a 12-month community order, Yvonne Cracknell, chair of the court, told the mother: 'This is your final chance. Take it with both hands.'

The court heard how Kirsopp needed to pay her bills but had no money because her partner had taken away her bank cards to prevent her from drinking on July 9.

She walked into town to get some money from the bank but met a friend who gave her some cash, which she spent on a large bottle of vodka and proceeded to drink the street.

Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: 'At shortly before noon, police received reports of concern for a baby being pushed in a pushchair by a lady struggling to walk, who appeared intoxicated.

'When police arrived, they found Kirsopp in the street with her two-year-old son in a buggy.

'She was barely able to stand. She could hardly talk or walk. She was crying and said to police she was alcoholic.

'The child was taken into police protection and she was arrested.'

He added: 'It's fair to say she gave a full account in interview. She was emotional in interview and was full of remorse.'

David Forrester, defending, said Kirsopp - who is tackling her alcohol problems with the help of the probation service - had a 'difficult and traumatic history'.

He said: 'She had been alcohol free for a number of months and lapsed on this occasion.

'She had no money and felt helpless.'

South Tyneside Magistrates' Court (pictured) heard how alcoholic Kirsopp 'could barely stand or talk' as she drank from a large bottle of vodka while pushing her two-year-son along a road in South Shields on July 9

The court heard that Kirsopp, of South Shields, had been given a four month jail term suspended for 18 months last August for driving with excess alcohol and being drunk in charge of a child.

Magistrates agreed not to activate the suspended sentence - instead extending it for a further six months.

The court was told that the youngster is still under Kirsopp's care at her home address.
