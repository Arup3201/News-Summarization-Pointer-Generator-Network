This parish church’s iconic Victorian clock has been used by locals to set their watches since 1871.

But the time is now 5:20 all day long at the picturesque St Michael and All Angels Church in Haworth, West Yorkshire, due to a health and safety ban that has been imposed on winding the clock.

Retired policeman Jens Hislop has climbed the steps of the church several times a week for 23 years to set the clock - which has been ticking since 1863 and is older than most of the church.

But an insurance inspection declared that Mr Hislop’s stepladder and winding platform - which have been at the church for decades - were unsafe, and the clock has been stuck at 5:20 since February.

Mr Hislop, 73, who has branded the ban ‘barmy and crazy’, cannot touch the clock again until £1,000 of safety work on the joinery has been carried out - which will be mainly paid for by worshippers.

He said yesterday: ‘I have been looking after the clock for 23 years and it has gone like clockwork. Then we had an insurance assessment and now health and safety has kicked in.

‘They say the platform, which has been there for decades, and the ladder, which was there when I started 23 years ago and was there before, are unsafe.

‘I personally don’t think it is unsafe. But they say it’s dangerous. The clock is in perfect working order but has been stopped since February. It is crazy.

‘The platform is only 10ft off the floor and the wooden step ladder was here when I started 23 years ago and is no different now to what it was then.’

Work needed: Church officials said the ladder - pictured with Reverend Mayo-Smith - is beyond its sell-by date

The clock mechanism runs down in eight days if not kept fully wound. Mr Hislop normally visited two to three times every week to maintain it.

‘I am perfectly willing to do it but I am not allowed to. It is health and safety gone barmy,’ he said.

Mr Hislop, who is also the church archivist, added: ‘I am not aware there has been an accident in the tower since it was built in 1871.  If there had been I would have been aware of it.

‘You could argue the church itself is more dangerous. You could bang your head on a pew or slip on the chancellery steps.

'Where do you draw the line? It is not the fault of the church people who are my friends. They have to do what health and safety dictates.’

Mr Hislop and his two assistants wind the clock by going up the tower by a spiral staircase to the first floor, where the bell chamber is located.

No winding allowed: But an insurance inspection declared that the stepladder and winding platform - which have been at the church for decades - were unsafe, and the clock has been stuck at 5:20 since February

He then places his step ladder on the floor of the bell chamber and climbs up to the wooden winding platform with his crank handle to wind the chimes and the mechanism.

'I have had tourists commenting on it and people in the street who keep looking up at it. So the quicker we can get it running, the happier I will be. It has just taken a lot longer than we thought'

Reverend Peter Mayo-Smith

But church officials said the ladder is beyond its sell-by date. The other problem is that they have been advised the bannisters are worn out and need replacing and building up to the right height.

The bannister height needs to be 3ft 7in - but at the moment is only 2ft 4in. A second rail is also needed to stop people slipping through gaps, the assessors said.

The lower part of the church tower dates back four centuries to when Patrick Bronte, father of the famous Bronte sisters, had his living in Haworth.

The upper tower - where the clock is - and the rest of the church were rebuilt in 1871, but still contain Bronte relics and are popular with Bronte fans all over the world.

'We would not want anybody seriously hurt while doing something for the benefit of the church and village'

‘So the quicker we can get it running, the happier I will be. It has just taken a lot longer than we thought.’

Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury Parish Council chairman John Huxley said: ‘We had an insurance assessment and they said the tower did not meet health and safety requirements for the clock winder.

‘We were told the clock winder would have to stop until we had completed the safety work. We were asked to do the work by the insurers so we have to do it.

‘We would not want anybody seriously hurt while doing something for the benefit of the church and village.’
