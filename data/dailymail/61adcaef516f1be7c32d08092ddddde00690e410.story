The manor house immortalised in the classic film The French Lieutenant's Woman has gone on the market for £3million. 

Ware House has some of the most stunning sea views in Britain which include 26 miles of coastline with not a single property in sight.

The six bed Regency house, that is owned by Winston Churchill's granddaughter-in-law, featured heavily in the 1981 adaptation of the novel The French Lieutenant's Woman by John Fowles.

In the movie, Meryl Streep plays Anna, an American actress brought in to play the quintessentially English part of Sarah Woodruff.

Minnie Churchill has lived in the 200-year-old property for the last 14 years but is now downsizing and has put it up for sale.

It is situated on the edge of Lyme Regis, Dorset, and overlooks the town's Cobb wall where Streep famously stood when she met Jeremy Irons' character for the first time.

But the property's main attraction is the unbroken views of the Lyme Bay coastline across to the Isle of Portland, with nothing in the way to blot the landscape.

Martin Lamb, of estate agents Savills, said it is the first time in 40 years Ware House had come on the open market. Mrs Churchill bought it in 1999 privately for £1.2 million. 

He said: 'The house sits to the west of Lyme Regis and faces the south east, which means it looks down on 26 miles of coastline.

'A French visitor to Ware House once compared the view to the Cote d'Azur to which Minnie Churchill is said to have replied that you can sea wall-to-wall villas on the hillside of the Cote d-Azor whereas you can't see a single house along the coast from the house.

'It has to be one of the best views in the country and it is a beautiful location.

'Lyme Regis was the setting for the French Lieutenant's Woman and Ware House was used as the main house in the film.'

Ware House comes with four reception rooms, six bathrooms, a library and 17 acres of gardens. It also has two cottages within the grounds, a stable courtyard and croquet lawn.

Minnie Churchill was married to the late Winston Churchill, the grandson of the war time Prime Minister of the same name.

The couple divorced in 1997 and she moved to Ware House two years later.

Ware House was built for the mayor of Lyme Regis before it was bought by the baronet Robert Bourchier Wrey.

Another mayor of Lyme Regis, Alban Woodruffe, inherited the mansion in 1908 and lived there for many years.

Ms Churchill now lives in Ware House with her long-time partner Simon Bird.

She said: 'We have one of the most stunning views in the country here and have the most beautiful house. It's a wonderful combination.

'You look straight down this amazing World Heritage Coastline and see the wonderful beaches and headlands but you can't see one single house.

'I am sure there are houses there, it is just that you can't see them.

'We are so lucky in Britain that we have good organisations that look after our coastlines.

'We are going to miss living here enormously, not just the view but the house as well, but it is time to downsize.'

Ms Churchill said she and Mr Bird plan to move to the Newbury area to be near her children and grandchildren.
