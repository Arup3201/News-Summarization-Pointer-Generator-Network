A 3-year-old girl shot in the head by her mother who killed her two siblings and herself in the shooting at their Denver home has made a 'miracle recovery', doctors said today.

Little Isabel Perez has been photographed in her hospital bed burdened with life changing injuries caused at the hands of her mother who decided to shoot her three children dead following a fight with her husband.

Doctors have been left astounded that the little girl was able to survive at all.

Denver Emergency Center for Children neurosurgeon  Dr. Ken Winston told 9 News: 'Isabel is doing extremely well given the severity of her injury'.

'I don't usually use the word miracle, but if you could ever use it this would be the example,' he told the Denver Post.

Stay at home mom Mayra Perez argued with her husband, Ricky, on February 7 and he left their home on North Pearl Street  for the night.

The next day the construction worker found his bloodied daughter lying alongside the bodies of her 1-year-old brother Erick Perez and 6-year-old sister Neveah Morales - both shot dead by their mother.

Mayra Perez also died - having turned the gun on herself.

The director of the unit also expressed her delight with Isabel's progress.

Dr 
Katie Bakes told the broadcaster: 'It's what we do on a daily basis, and we are just happy and pleased to provide that to her'.

It is not known what the couple were fighting about on the night of Perez's murder-suicide but her brother said she told him it was 'just a married couple thing' hours before she decided to kill her children and herself.

The couple had moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas, two years before for better work opportunities.

Mr Perez and the couples families were left traumatized by the shooting but today expressed their thanks to well-wishers across the country and the world who offered their support.

'Our family has been deeply touched by the support we've received from Colorado, the nation, and the world,' they said in a statement released by the hospital.'Â 

'From the family in Colorado Springs who sent us pizza in the hospital to eat to the prayers and letters we've received from as far as Peru. Our family is grateful for the kind prayers and thoughts we've felt from the community.'

'We also want to express our deepest appreciation to the community in El Paso, TX. Their fundraising efforts, prayers, and support have meant the world to us.'

The statement also added that they hope Isabel will soon be leaving the hospital and they reiterated the doctors view that her recovery has been a miracle and thanked them for their tireless work.

'As Isabel prepares to leave Denver Health for the next step in her healing we are grateful to the paramedics, doctors and nurses who have cared for her and us during this difficult time,' it continued.

'Isabel is a miracle. She's a testament of strength and resilience our children can show during adversity and tragedy. Thank you again for your support and prayers.'
