Justice Secretary Chris Grayling apologies to the Commons for the breach in confidentiality

Phone calls between dozens MPs and inmates have been recorded and monitored by prison staff, it emerged today.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling issued an apology to the House of Commons after revealing the extraordinary breach, which dates back to 2006.

Labour condemned the 'truly shocking' admission, as an independent investigation was launched by the Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick.

MPs were told that the National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons across the country, had identified calls dating back to 2006 which had been recorded. 

It includes calls made by former Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw and staff working for current Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes.

Mr Grayling said he learned of the error last Wednesday, and had come to Parliament 'at the earliest opportunity'.

In total, there are 32 MPs 'whose calls or those for their offices appear to have been both recorded and listened to', Mr Grayling admitted.

'For 18 of these MPs it appears the prison did not list the number as confidential and therefore the action was not taken to prevent recording.'

He added: 'In a further 15 cases, members appear to have been identified correctly on the system as MPs, but due to a potential failure in the administrative process the required action was not taken by prison staff so the calls were recorded and appear to have been listened to, one member falls under both categories.'

Prison rules state that communication between prisoners and MPs must be treated as confidential where the prisoner is a constituent of theirs.

Mr Grayling said there is no evidence that information from the phone calls was passed on to anyone else and he did not believe it was part of a concerted attempt to monitor calls.

The Justice Secretary stressed it was part of the routine checking process and mistakes may have been made.

He told the Commons: 'I have as yet seen no evidence that information was passed on to anyone else, I don't believe this was part of a concerted attempt to monitor, it was simply part of the routine checking of this process to make sure nothing untoward was going on.

'But clearly again, it's something I'll be asking Nick Hardwick to confirm.'

Mr Grayling said he believed all recordings have now been destroyed as they are only kept for a limited period.

It emerged that a call made by ex-Justice Secretary Jack Straw and one by the office of Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes were among those recorded

Since improvements to the system in autumn 2012, only one MP clearly identified on prison lists has had their calls with prisoners recorded and listened to, he added.

But there have been a small number of cases where phone calls between prisoners and lawyers were 'accidentally recorded', Mr Grayling said.

He added: 'Whilst these have been dealt with individually with the prisoner at the time, I want to be confident that the safeguards for all confidential calls are satisfactory.'

Mr Grayling said Mr Hardwick will first report at the end of the month to ensure that safeguards to stop phone calls being recorded or listened to are in place before publishing a full assessment of the facts in early 2015.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the revelations were 'truly shocking' and welcomed the investigation to be led by Mr Hardwick.

He pointed out that some of the conversations may have taken place with prisoners who had not yet been convicted of a crime.

He told the Commons: 'What you have outlined in your statement is a very serious breach of confidentiality involving MPs and their constituents.

'Many of us in this House will deal with constituents in prison, many of which I remind the House have not been found guilty of any crimes, on a regular basis as part of our duties as good constituency MPs, often our staff speak to prisoners on our behalf as they do with other case work.

'I am sure I am not alone in being shocked in hearing today's news that some of these conversations have been listened into, that some of these conversations have been listened into and recorded.'

Liberal Democrat Justice Minister Simon Hughes said: 'This is a serious matter and everybody should be able to contact their MP confidentially, whatever their circumstances.

'The Ministry of Justice has appointed Nick Hardwick, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, to lead an investigation and I expect all officials to provide full and frank disclosures to this inquiry.'
