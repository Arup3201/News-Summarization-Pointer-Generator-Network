For centuries only the light of Rudolph's red nose could guide Santa's sleigh, and perhaps that's why he avoided being spotted for so long.

But with the march of modern technology, it was only a matter of time before he was caught on film.

Finally he has been captured - by the thermal imaging camera of a police helicopter above Leicester.

Could it be? Santa may visit the world's population of seven billion in just one night, but the Husbands Bosworth police helicopter crew apparently managed to spot him doing his rounds above Leicester

The image, which the crew confirmed was a bit of fun Photoshop trickery, showed the legs of two reindeer

The image was apparently taken at 1.44am on Christmas Day, a time consistent with when Father Christmas might have reached the East Midlands.

It appears to show a contraption being pulled by at least two deer- or horse-like creatures.

The photo prompted amusement after it was posted to the Twitter feed of the National Police Air Service helicopter at Husbands Bosworth airfield, south of Leicester.

The crew wrote: 'We picked up an unusual heat source on the last flight? Santa? Could it be? #999Crimbo'

Chief Constable of Leicester Police Simon Cole seemed unfussed about the potential danger from a UFO, however. He Tweeted: 'What a great heat source shot. Thanks for getting #Santa round.'

Hoax: The image by the East Midlands police helicopter, pictured, prompted chuckles among Twitter users

Amusing: This clearly Photoshopped image by the Met Police helicopter was a more obvious hoax

Twitter user Gordon Farmer added: 'I was trying for four years in security to get an image of the big man on CCTV. I'm jealous now.'

But not all were so positive. One, @Dan_Infidel, said: 'Pull him for drink driving'.

Sadly, the crew have since confirmed it was a hoax created on Photoshop for fun.

It is thought it may have been adapted from a colour image which was claimed to have been taken in Mexico in October 1998.

It came after the Metropolitan Police's helicopter crew also took a few minutes out of their day for a Christmas hoax.

Last night they posted a clearly manipulated photo showing a flying sleigh in front of their helicopter, with the Tweet: '#Santa Collision Avoidance System working well, according to the night crew.'
