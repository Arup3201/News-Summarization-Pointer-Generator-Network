A wealthy Serbian bachelor has been posting pictures of himself in his mansion in the hope that his wealth will lure in a lady.

And if his obvious opulence wasn't enough to tempt potential suitors, he has also donned a series of snappy outfits, including a pink dressing gown.

In a note attached to the photos, the man who calls himself Don Milisav Juan Gonzales Brzi, says: 'To all unmarried ones who would like to spend their life by my side and within all the beauties of my home.

Form a line, ladies: Serbian bachelor Don Milisav Juan Gonzales Brzi is hoping his wealth, interior design skills, and impeccable dress sense will find him an 'unmarried one' to share his life with

In a bizarre series of pictures the eligible man is seen sitting in various rooms around his mansion home

Snappy dresser: Mr Brzi is seen wearing everything from dressing gowns to dinner jackets

'Please look below at all the magic of my home that I have decorated with taste, perhaps just for YOU.'

The bizarre snaps have been circulating on Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian websites and have since gone viral.

In them the grey-haired singleton is seen standing awkwardly in his bathroom, 'relaxing' on a bed and kneeling in what appears to be a hallway.

If red really is the colour of love then he will surely have no problem attracting a partner with those shoes

Mr Brzi claims to be 39-years-old, living in St Petersburg and looking for a much younger 16-20-year-old for a relationship and marriage.

The Serb displays a clear love of the finer things in life, with everything from his bed to his bidet finished with gold trim.

Artwork and painted frescoes decorate nearly every wall in his home, including in both of the huge bathrooms.

Midas touch: after gold plated tables and toilets Brzi continues his love for the precious metal on this sofa set

The privileged man could be making himself out to be wealthier than he is, as several of the shots appear to be on the same room but from different angles. Here the sofas from the last image are clearly visible (bottom left)

Whoever takes up his offer will have to deal with the cold weather, as temperatures can plummet as low as -5C in winter.

Perhaps the young lady in question could borrow one of Brzi's fur coats to keep warm in, as he appears to have several.

Either the pictures were taken around Christmas-time, or Mr Brzi is slow to take his decorations down, as tinsel and baubles feature in the background of several shots.

In another festive photograph Brzi is seen outside in front of a snow covered pine tree complete with decorations

Hotting up: with a quick change into some other, very warm, furs the supposed 39-year-old is ready for another snap in the study

With this welcoming pose Brzi is hoping to entice a nubile wife into his home

Despite appearing on Eastern European websites months ago, it is not known whether or not Mr Brzi ever found his dream nubile bride.

It is difficult to image how he would have been unable to attract a partner given his dashing looks and dapper dress sense.

If he has been unsuccessful, he might want to consider adding a profile to one of the many dating sites which cater exclusively to wealthy men seeking younger women, such as sugardaddie.com.

Brzi's interior design taste even stretches as far as classical architecture, which probably helped to inspire this mosaic floor

Getting down to business: surrounded by more art and tinsel, the only place Brzi looks truly at home is behind his desk
