A federal judge  shot in the leg outside his Detroit home was trying to protect his family during a robbery attempt.

Terrence Berg  was taking out the  trash Thursday night when two people confronted him to try to get inside his home.

U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said Berg refused and was 'heroic' in protecting his family.

Berg was taking out the trash when two men tried to rob him or get into his house, at which point he blocked them to protect his family

'True to his character, Judge Berg heroically protected his family by refusing to let the robbers inside his home, McQuade told The Detroit News.

'He took a bullet in the leg, but possibly spared his family from a worse outcome. All of his friends and former colleagues at the U.S. Attorney's Office are rooting and praying for him for a speedy and full recovery.' 

Berg, 55, was shortly shot after 9pm, and police believe that the men were either trying to rob him or make their way into his home.

Berg's wife, Anita Sevier, says he will undergo surgery later Friday and that his injury isn't life-threatening. 

Nobody has been arrested in the shooting and the case has been turned over to the FBI.

If Berg was targeted by the men because he is a judge they will face federal charges.

The 55-year-old has been a judge for two years, and his court is in Flint. Berg served as a federal prosecutor for two decades, including briefly as head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit. 

He was nominated to the position in April 2012 by President Barack Obama.

'The lucky thing for whoever did this, is that they didn't kill him. Because then, my goodness. I'm glad he's OK.'

Berg has three children.
