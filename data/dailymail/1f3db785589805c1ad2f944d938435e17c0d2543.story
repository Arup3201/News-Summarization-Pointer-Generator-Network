Fear: Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party

Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party.

The Liberal Democrat peer - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘nuclear’ if party leader Nick Clegg stops him from re-joining the party.

Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party.

Now friends feel he has been treated ‘cruelly’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently.

He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times.

A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night.

The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him.

According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets.

The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him.

The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book. It’s no wonder that it’s taken ten years for anyone to confront him.’ 

Crisis management: Lord Rennard was also at the centre of managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that Mark Oaten (left) had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown (right)

Lord Rennard was also at the centre of 
managing other Lib Dem crises such as the discovery that former MP Mark 
Oaten had hired a rent boy and the extra-marital affairs of Lord Ashdown
 when he was party leader.

He was also chief executive at the time that former party leader Charles Kennedy resigned after his drinking habit was exposed.

Another Lib Dem source revealed: ‘He is the mastermind of many of the dirty tricks campaigns during elections that we have, rightly or wrongly, become known for.

He once suggested printing a 
photograph of an opponent’s house on a leaflet to point out that he did 
not live in the constituency. This was vetoed.’

But
 sources close to party leader Nick Clegg have called it a ‘grubby 
threat’ and warned that ‘it is this sort of thing that got us into this 
mess in the first place...it’s time to move past it.’

An independent mediator is being appointed by the Lib Dems to try and broker a truce between both sides.

Plans for a second inquiry might be 
dropped if Lord Rennard apologises but he will only do so if any threat 
of legal action by the complainants is dropped.

Mr Clegg’s leadership faced a fresh crisis last week after revelations that Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent. Mr Clegg said the first he knew about the crisis was when he saw a report by an independent QC into the claims.

There is no sign yet of the crisis abating. Yesterday (SUN), senior Lib Dem councillor in Portsmouth, Eleanor Scott,  quit the party group over the way it had handled the affair.

She has represented Fratton, the same ward as Mr Hancock, since 2002.

Cllr Scott told the Mail she had quit the Lib Dem group of councillors on Portsmouth City Council.

She added: ‘I remain a Liberal Democrat Party member, and committed to being a councillor and Portsmouth.

‘I hope that others involved in the Group’s decision On Friday will reflect on their positions, and do the right thing.

‘We need to run a city, not a game show.

Cllr Scott added: ‘I have previously raised concerns with Liberal Democrat Party headquarters in London, and I trust that they will concede that they need to give me, and others here, support to clean out the Augean Stables.’
