Manchester United scouts are watching Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka.

The long-time Liverpool target is available for £12.1million this summer and United have joined the throngs watching him lately with Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham, Arsenal and German club Schalke all represented.

Liverpool came close to doing a deal of nearly £20m in January while Tottenham have maintained dialogue with Dnipro ahead of appointing a new manager.

United were approached about the 24-year-old last year but did not believe he was consistent enough and they will take further reports before making a decision whether to bid in the coming weeks.

Louis van Gaal is an admirer but winger is not a priority position and United have other players under consideration.
