Andrew Watson is acknowledged as the first black international player

The unseemly incidents involving John Terry and Luis Suarez have brought the issue of racism in football to the fore again.

But it is a problem almost as old as the game itself.

The first black man to play international football sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, encountered abuse on the pitch it emerged today.

Andrew Watson first played for Scotland in 1881 in a 6-1 defeat of England in London.

He was captain of the side that day in a game that remains England’s heaviest defeat on home soil.

He made two further international appearances, and enjoyed a highly successful club career, playing as a full back, at a time the game as we know it today was taking shape.

But being a pioneer for black players on the pitch meant he was subject to abuse.

Richard McBrearty, the curator of the Scottish Football Museum, told CNN: ‘What we come across in a very polite article about Watson is that he encountered "splenetic players" on the field. Now that suggests to me that the colour of his skin was a subject of attack.

‘That's an insight into the fact that, even in that time, this was clearly happening and Watson had to rise above that as a footballer and more widely as a human being.’

But Watson was able to maintain his dignity and apparently had a reputation as a gentleman off the pitch.

‘Certainly there is widespread praise that he wins,’ said Mr McBrearty. ‘The adoration that he has is clearly because he manages to rise above the difficulties that he encounters on the field of play.’

For a while it was believed that the first black footballer was Arthur Wharton, who played for the English team of Preston North End.

But Watson pre-dates him by 11 years. Mr McBrearty told CNN that up until Pele arrived on the world stage, Watson was perhaps the most important black player in world football.

Watson played three times for Scotland in the 1880s, twice against England and once against Wales

Watson was born in French Guiana in 1857 to a wealthy Scottish sugar planter Peter Miller and a local woman named Anna Rose.

But  attitudes of the time meant that Watson, while enjoying financial support and a good education, was never truly acknowledged by his father.

‘Anything that had to be signed, due to school or education, was usually done through an intermediary,’ Mr McBrearty explained. ‘So he was recognised as being of the blood, but there was a distance.’

‘He was the son of a Glasgow merchant who traded out in the West Indies and parts of South America as well. It's a story of the time, I suppose.’

He was educated at King's College School, where he excelled at sports including football.He
went on to study natural philosophy, mathematics and engineering at 
University of Glasgow, before leaving, it is thought, to begin work as 
an engineer.

But his love of – and talent for – football blossomed.

Early
records show Watson left a club called Maxwell to join Glasgow team 
Parkgrove - which at the time enjoyed a higher profile than Glasgow 
Rangers.

He also filled the role of  match secretary, thus creating history by being the first black football administrator.

In
1880 he joined Queen's Park, the biggest of the Glasgow clubs. He led 
the team to several Scottish Cup wins, creating further history be 
becoming the first black player to win a major competition.

The
following year he represented Scotland in his first of three 
international outings, captaining the country in the landmark 6-1 
victory over England at the Oval.

Watson's
entry in the Scottish Football Association Annual of 1880–81 reads as 
follows:‘Watson, Andrew: One of the very best backs we have; since 
joining Queen's Park has made rapid strides to the front as a player; 
has great speed and tackles splendidly; powerful and sure kick; well 
worthy of a place in any representative team.’

In
November 1877 he married Jessie Nimmo Armour. Their son, Rupert, was 
born the following year and a daughter, Agnes Maude, in 1880.

Records show that by 1881 the family was living in Govan.

A few days after his first game for 
Scotland, he played again as they defeated Wales 5-1. His third and last
cap came on Scottish soil at Hampden Park, against England on 11 March 
1882. A game which ended in another 5-1 victory for Scotland.

In 1882, he was the first black player to play in the FA Cup when he played for London club Swifts. Two years later became the first foreign player to be invited to join the Corinthians, a team that allowed only 50 members of high elite to join.

Little is unknown about Watson’s later life, but he passed away in Sydney, Australia in 1902 aged 44,What is not in doubt, however, is the pioneering contribution he made to the game of football.

Mr McBrearty said: ‘He's massively important to global football, not just Scottish football, not just British football. He's one of the first few pioneers. He played international football, he captained the international team and they happened to be the best there was at that time.

‘As football spreads across the globe with black players who are now among the best in the world, and you look at the legacy of fantastic Brazilian players like Pele and Garrincha, it really stems back to guys like Watson.’

In 1926 the sportswriter ‘Tityrus’ (the pen name of J.A.H. Catton, editor of the Athletic News), a man who had watched almost every England-Scotland international over the preceding 50 years, named Andrew Watson as left back in his all-time Scotland team.

It was a fitting accolade for a man whose influence is still felt in the modern game.
