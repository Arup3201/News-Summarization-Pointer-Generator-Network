As the Mini Style Hacker, Ryker Wixom's impressive Blue Steel has already won his Instagram account over 200,000 followers.

But it seems the four-year-old, from Los Angeles, California, has plenty of opinions about the clothes he models, too.

In a new shoot for zulily, he poses in mom Collette's favorite fall must-haves. But while her praise is largely for items that marry versatility and durability with style, Ryker has different reasons for liking his clothes.

Ryker's choice: 'Wait, are these two jackets or one? It has a hood… I think it’s gonna rain! I love the hood. I can’t wait for it to rain!'

Faux leather patches on a pair of jogger pants, for instance, are great only because they 'have leg shields so I can joust on a horse.'

A classic button-down is hailed a 'Daddy shirt' and T-shirts only pass muster if they are funny (in this instance, pineapples and pandas wearing hipster glasses fit the bill).

As far as Collette is concerned, denim, graphic T-shirts and button-down shirts form the basis of her boys' closets (she is also mother to two-year-old Grey)

'Every boy should own a button down,' she says. 'They are so versatile and comfortable. My boys wear them constantly!'

Jogger sweats with faux leather patches: 'These pants have leg shields so I can joust on a horse'

Button-down shirt: 'This shirt looks like a Daddy shirt. I am going to go to work with him when I wear it'

Denim, she adds, is 'always on trend for kids - and T-shirts don't have to be boring.

'If my boys wear a graphic tee it has to be a great one!' she says. 'There are so many amazing designs out there that don’t just involve the usual kid characters.'

The Mini Style Hacker Instagram shot to fame when Collette began posting photos of Ryker  copying the outfits and poses of celebrities and models.

The mother-of-two, who works full-time in publishing and runs the blog and social media feeds in her free time, admits she never anticipated this level of success when she started sharing photos of her son online.

Check blazer and pineapple tee: 'My friends at school like this jacket [Ryker wore it last week]. I wanna eat that pineapple but he has glasses on so I can’t'

Velvet blazer: 'This jacket is cozy. It feels like Softy Pizza [Ryker’s favorite stuffed white tiger]'

Polka dot blazer and panda tee: 'I like to wear shirts with funny stuff! The panda has a funny face and glasses. He also has a bumblebee on his tail, that’s why the jacket has polka dots'

She writes on the Mini Style Hacker blog: 'We use our imaginations a ton and have a great time while doing so. If you see him with his hands in his pockets, he is holstering his imaginary laser guns. 

'If you see him leaning against a wall, he is trying to push it over with his body weight.'

Of course, it is a priority for Collette that the Mini Style Hacker project remains fun for Ryker.

'I don't want it to be something he doesn't like doing,' she said. 'He is a four-year old. He's not a model kid who will do whatever I say.' 

Family affair: Ryker's mother Collette Wixom is the real talent behind Mini Style Hacker. Younger son Grey (right) also makes occasional cameos on the Instagram page
