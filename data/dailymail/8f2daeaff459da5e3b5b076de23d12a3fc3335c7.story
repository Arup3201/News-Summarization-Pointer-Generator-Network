Over the past few weeks, much has been written and remembered about the Titanic, which famously sank exactly one hundred years ago yesterday.

But while the story the hubris surrounding Titanic has been told again and again, not so much has been said about its nemesis - the iceberg that sent it to a watery grave.

These pictures, taken after the Titanic sank, show what is quite possibly the only photographic evidence of the ice floe that caused the tragedy.

Ancient: This photo of the iceberg that sank the Titanic was taken by the chief steward of the German ocean liner SS Prinz Adalbert just hours after the tragedy. Its identity was confirmed by a red streak of paintwork scraped across its base, an indication that it had collided with a vessel in the past 12 hours or so

The first was taken by the chief steward of SS Prinz Adalbert, a German liner, which sailed through the North Atlantic on April 15 just miles from where the Titanic sank the night before.

He recorded seeing a streak of red paint smeared across the base of the floe - indicating that it was likely it had collided with a ship in the past 12 hours.

The next photo was taken by Captain De Carteret of the Minia, a cable laying vessel which raced to the scene of the shipwreck to recover corpses and debris. According to the Minia's records, it was the only iceberg in the area. He also noticed the red scar along the base - a clear sign it was the culprit for the Titanic's ignominious end.

That iceberg began its slow journey to
the North Atlantic over three throusand years ago - making it a rough 
contemporary of Egyptian King Tutankhamun.

The
exact details can only be a matter for speculation, but io9.com reports
that it likely began with snowfall on the Western coast of Greenland 
somewhere around 1,000BC. As
months passed, this snow gradually turned into a more compacted form - 
known as firn - which over subsequent decades was compressed into dense 
ice as new layers of fresh snow fell on top.

Massive: Captain De Carteret of the cable laying vessel Minia captured this shot of the iceberg as it sped to the scene to help with the Titanic recovery. It likely began life some 30 centuries ago - around the time of King Tutankhamun - as a blizzard on Greenland's tundra solidified to form glaciers

Hundreds of generations passed and entire civilisations rose and fell as this ill-fated ice was slowly forced further west towards the sea.

Finally reaching Greenland's Arctic Ocean coast, the lapping tide began breaking away chunks of the glacier and the infamous iceberg was calved - thirty centuries after first freezing. But after it finally fell into the sea, the iceberg's life was a short one, io9.com reports.

In
order to reach the spot in the North Atlantic where the Titanic met its
fate, currents must have taken the floe far south from where it was 
calved.

From the Greenland 
coast, it would have floated on the currents from Baffin Bay to the 
Davis Strait, onto the Labrador Sea and then finally into the Atlantic.

By April 15, 2012, the date of the Titanic disaster, the iceberg was some 5,000 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

That night, the water temperature was estimated at about 28F (2.2C) - lethal for anyone unlucky enough to find themselves plunged into it but far too warm to sustain icebergs for long.

The life-expectancy of an iceberg in the North Atlantic is about two or three years from calving to melting.

This means, according to io9, that it is likely the Titanic iceberg broke off from Greenland in 1910 or 1911 and was gone for ever by 1913 at the latest.
