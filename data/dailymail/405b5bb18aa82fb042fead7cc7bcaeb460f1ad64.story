The European Tour suffered a blow on Wednesday when Volvo announced they are ending a multi-million-pound commitment to sponsor two events.

The Swedish car makers are pulling out of deals to sponsor the World Match Play Championship, to be played at the London Club next week, and the Volvo Champions in South Africa. This year, total prize money for the events was £5million.

The news will cast a dampener on proceedings when the Match Play, staged at Wentworth for more than 40 years, returns to Britain for the first time since 2007 for its 50th anniversary.

Volvo have been ever-present on the Tour since 1988 so it is a severe blow in terms of prestige. In a sign of the times, they will continue to sponsor one tour event — in China.

Guy Kinnings, global head of golf for IMG, who promote both Volvo events, is confident of finding a new sponsor for the Match Play but admits that staging the Champions event may be a problem. ‘We might have to skip a year and bring it back in 2016,’ he said.

Meanwhile, England’s David Howell will complete the five-man panel who will choose Europe’s next Ryder Cup captain. He joins previous captains Paul McGinley, Colin Montgomerie and Jose Maria Olazabal plus Tour chief George O’Grady.
