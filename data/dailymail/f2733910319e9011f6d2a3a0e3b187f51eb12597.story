They were the footwear de rigueur on the fashion circuit this year, and now New Balance has been given the seal of approval by supermodel Heidi Klum.

The supermodel has collaborated with the sportswear brand to design a new collection of women's activewear this autumn.

The 41-year-old promises that her new range offers 'fashion forward and versatile' sportswear, suitably influenced by her own statement style.

According to the brand, the range includes their usual attention to detail with a splash of Heidi's modern, sophisticated taste.  

The collection includes capri pants and lightweight vest tops featuring elements such as moisture-wicking fabrics to keep the wearer cool as they work up a sweat.

Meanwhile woven bomber jackets will keep out the winter chill when training outdoors.

Speaking about the collection, Heidi said: 'I was inspired by animal prints and bold colours like oxblood, combat green, and UV blue that give it a strong, urban, street wear vibe.  

'In this collection, I also played with fabric cut-outs for an edgy and fashion-forward look. I really love the way everything came together in this collection.'

A spokesperson for New Balance said: 'The range continues to combine our expertise in innovative technology and performance with Heidi’s commitment to sophisticated style. 

'This is an extremely versatile collection that women will find both wearable and chic for every day.'

The collection, which is available now from UK retailers, Sporting Pro and Next, ranges in price from £30-£65.

This isn't the first time Heidi has turned her hand to designing. The mother-of-four also has her own maternity wear lines called Lavish & Loved By Heidi Klum.

'I experienced fashion challenges during my four pregnancies and combined my knowledge of what works in terms of style, comfort and practicality to create these lines,' Heidi said when those lines were released.

'Being pregnant shouldn't stop you from being fashionable and feeling great about your changing body. It's an exciting journey.'  

Despite her busy life as a fashion designer, presenter on Project Runway and judge on America's Got Talent, being a mother definitely seems to come first for Heidi. 

The blonde got to enjoy some family time on Thursday, and had her mother Ema on hand to help keep an eye on her brood. 

Heidi has had primary custody of her children since her divorce from their father, British singer Seal in 2012.
