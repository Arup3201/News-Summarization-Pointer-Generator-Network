Parkinson's affects 127,000 Britons mostly aged 60 and over

Scientists are developing a ‘teardrop’ test that could help identify people in the early stages of Parkinson’s.

Powerful MRI scans reveal that patients with the disease do not have a distinctive teardrop mark in their brains like healthy people.

The discovery could help doctors diagnose the degenerative brain disorder, track its progress and monitor whether drugs are working.

Comedian Billy Connolly revealed this week that he is in the early stages of Parkinson’s disease, which affects 127,000 Britons mostly aged 60 and over.

The condition destroys brain cells producing the chemical messenger dopamine in the part of the brain that controls movement. As well as affecting movement, it can cause memory problems.

Researchers at Nottingham University and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust believe they have found a biological marker that shows the presence of the disease in the brain.

Using imaging techniques, they compared the brains of Parkinson’s patients with those of healthy people, focusing on nigrosomes, clusters of dopamine-rich cells in a particular part of the brain.

The findings, published in the journal Neurology, showed that a telltale teardrop mark in the brains of healthy people was missing in Parkinson’s sufferers.

Professor Penny Gowland, who is based at the University’s Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre, said the mark showed up under an extremely powerful 7T MRI scanner.

‘This was a breakthrough discovery in that we now know that using this particular MRI scanner, we can see that patients living with Parkinson’s disease don’t have this particular feature in their brain,’ she said.

She added that there is a need for imaging tracking to monitor the progression of the disease and allow for the development of neuroprotective drugs.

Researchers plan to develop a test that could be adapted to standard MRI scans.

Professor Gowland said: ‘We are now conducting a study of patients with Parkinson’s to ascertain when this mark actually disappears, which could potentially have huge implications for early diagnosis of the illness, and subsequently how it is treated.’
