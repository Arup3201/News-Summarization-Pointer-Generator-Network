A team of emergency responders turned up to treat 15 cheerleaders who were overcome by bus fumes traveling home from a competition in Virginia on Sunday night 

An official said the bus was traveling on Interstate 95 on Sunday night when passengers began smelling an unknown fume. 

The bus stopped and emergency responders were contacted. Fire crews revealed that carbon monoxide poisoning was suspected.

The bus was traveling to North Carolina from a cheerleading competition in Washington, D.C.

One girl fell ill on the bus while another was vomiting in the bathroom, a clerk at the gas station where the bus pulled over told CBS.

The store employee said: 'A lot of people, they can’t breathe inside the bus... And all of a sudden, five or six ambulances came in.'

Ten victims were taken to Mary Washington Hospital while another five were sent to Spotsylvania Regional Hospital.

Details of the cheerleaders' condition are unknown. MailOnline was awaiting an update from the Spotsylvania Sheriff's Department on Monday.
