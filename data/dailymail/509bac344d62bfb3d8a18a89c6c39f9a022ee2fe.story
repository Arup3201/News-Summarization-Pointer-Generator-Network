Ricky Ponting has backed Kevin Pietersen and says he has seen 'pointing of fingers' and 'expletives' from bowlers James Anderson and Graeme Swann after fielders made mistakes.

Pietersen's autobiography, launched on Monday, brought forward allegations of a 'bullying culture' in the England camp and Ponting insists Australia batsmen have witnessed the abuse.

'We saw them doing it, Anderson was always the same, and Swann,' the former Australian captain says, reported by Daily Telegraph.

'The pointing of fingers and you'd hear a few expletives if there was a misfield or a dropped catch.

'The guys who were doing it were the so-called leaders. That's where the captain has got to come in, not wait and let little things turn into big things. That's what it sounds like has happened in this England team.'

Ponting admits Australia were far from perfect when dealing with errors from team-mates, but says he would not stand for such abuse while he was at the helm. 'If a young bloke had dropped a catch and a bowler went off at him, that's just not acceptable,' he adds.

'No one means to drop a catch, no one means to bowl a bad ball, no one means to play a bad shot. It just happens in a game and you have to accept it and move on.' 

A damning five-page dossier from the ECB on Tuesday appeared to expose Pietersen as a hypocrite

It comes as a damning five-page dossier from the ECB appears to expose Pietersen as a hypocrite and divisive influence, which was revealed on Tuesday. 

Ponting reckons he witnessed a better England side with Pietersen included during three Ashes defeats, but the Australian knew they were capable of folding under pressure.

'They had lot of very good players that were able to achieve a lot of success as a team,' he adds.

'But if you could just get inside of them and start pulling them apart, we always had a feeling they would implode pretty quickly and that's what's happened over the past 12 months.

'I wasn't surprised with (Jonathan) Trott (leaving the Ashes tour), I wasn't surprised with Swann retiring when he did when the ship started to go down, he jumped off pretty quickly, and now all the Pietersen stuff.'

Ponting would not tolerate such abuse in his Australia camp and adds: 'That's just not acceptable'
