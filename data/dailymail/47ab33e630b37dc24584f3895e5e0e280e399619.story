The founder of StandUp for Kids, the national group for at-risk and homeless children, has been arrested in Aurora, Colorado on child sexual assault charges.

Richard Koca Sr., 69, faces seven felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust involving a pattern of abuse, according to an Arapahoe County Court case summary. The court record indicates the alleged abuse began in August 2009 and continued into 2012.

Aurora police spokeswoman Sgt. Cassidee Carlson said Koca was arrested Saturday on a felony arrant for sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust for acts with a child he was supervising in Aurora.

Carlson said the investigation, which began on Aug. 29, has identified a single juvenile victim. 

However, police said that because of Koca’s extensive contact over the past several decades with juveniles through his work with several non-profit organizations that primarily serve children, there are concerns that there may be additional victims.

'We're aware of the fact that there might be other victims out there. We're encouraging them to come forward,' Carlson told 7NEWS.

Koca made his first court appearance Monday in Arapahoe County. He is being held in the Arapahoe County Jail on $250,000 bond.

While an archived version of the StandUp for Kids website included Koca’s message about helping homeless youth, the site appears to have been taken offline.

Koca has volunteered with organizations to help children worldwide. He was a Scout Master for the Boy Scouts of America in Panama, volunteer at an orphanage in England, and involved in Explorer scout programs in San Diego, California.

'He placed himself in situations where there were youth around with the facade that he was doing good,' Carlson said.

Koca founded StandUp for Kids in San Diego in 1990. The nonprofit, now based in Atlanta, reports involvement with programs in 37 cities nationwide.

Justine Madison, the organization's interim national director, said StandUp for Kids - or SUFK - has not been contacted by law enforcement about Koca.

'However, if contacted, the organization intends to cooperate fully,' Madison said.

The statement said Koca retired from his position as SUFK's chief executive officer in June 2010. Koca continued to serve on the organization's board of directors until his arrest, Madison said.
