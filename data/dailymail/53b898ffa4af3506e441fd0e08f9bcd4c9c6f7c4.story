The grandfather of premature twin babies has spoken of the heartbreaking decision to turn their life support off before their mother was ever able to meet them. 

Melody and Rose Clarke were born on October 29 eight weeks premature when their mother, Jocelyn Bennett, was rushed to hospital having suffered a placental abruption. 

While the 27-year-old remains in a coma at Birmingham Women's Hospital, her father, Joe Bennett, has spoken of the agonising decision to turn off her daughters' life support six days after their birth.   

Premature twins Melody and Rose died six days after being born by Caesarian section after emergency services took 30 minutes to help their mother, Jocelyn Bennett (pictured right), who is in a coma 

Jocelyn Bennett phoned 999 after waking up with severe stomach pains. The 27-year-old had suffered a placental abruption 

'We wanted Joyce to see them so asked to keep them alive until Tuesday at 1pm,' Joe Bennett, the babies' grandfather said. 

'That's the decision I made and I will have to live with that for the rest of my life.

'We knew they weren't going to make it.' 

Melody and Rose were born on October 29 via emergency C-section after their mother, Jocelyn, phoned 999 shortly after 5am.  

Paramedics arrived at the tower block of flats where she lives minutes later, but were locked out for half-an-hour as the 27-year-old writhed in agony inside.

By the time they accessed the building, Ms Bennett's was barely conscious and she was rushed to hospital.

After being born in an emergency procedure on October 29 doctors, placed the babies on life support to fight organ failure at the family's request, in the hope their mother would regain consciousness. 

But on November 4 after neither Ms Bennett or the babies showed signs of improvement, their ventilators were turned off.  

With his wife Lorraine and the twins' father Kevin Clarke, Mr Bennett celebrated Christmas with a small party in the hospital for the babies, and witnessed their baptism on the day they were born.

'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives,' the 54-year-old added. 

'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' 

After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. 

'She had packed her suitcase for the girls already as she was so organised.

'Each had a pink vest with the slogan 'Born in 2014', Melody wore a pale pink shade, whilst Rose had a brighter one.

'They both wore a babygro with a teddy bear on the front. Once the girls were dressed and ready, they were taken over to Joyce so she could have special time with her twins.

'We wrapped them each in blankets that had been put on Joyce.'

The grandparents then left the babies with their father, Kevin Clarke, before their deaths.   

Speaking of the day her daughter was left for half-an-hour in agony, she said: 'She phoned me very early in the morning to say she was in a lot of pain. 

'We quickly established it wasn't labour but knew it wasn't right and I told her to call 999.

Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin Clarke (left) have one child together. The mother's father, Joe Bennett (right) said the decision to turn off the babies' life support was one he would have to live with for the rest of his life 

'I said would head over there straight away on foot.

'I started off and Joyce managed to call emergency services. The crews passed me on the way and saw me dashing along but obviously didn't know I was Joyce's mother.

'When they got there, they couldn't get her to open the door and the police officer smashed through panel so they could get in.

This is the tragic timeline that shows it took paramedics some 30 minutes to reach Jocelyn Bennett after she called 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. 

'I arrived just as they were doing that. When we got into the flat she was semi-conscious on the bed and was in so much pain. She wasn't really with us at all and was drifting in and out of consciousness.

'By this point Joyce wasn't talking or responding to anyone. All I could see were her lips turning blue and she wasn't breathing.'  

Previously Mr Bennett said neighbours in the block of flats refuse to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid.  

'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid.

'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 

'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place. 

A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.'
