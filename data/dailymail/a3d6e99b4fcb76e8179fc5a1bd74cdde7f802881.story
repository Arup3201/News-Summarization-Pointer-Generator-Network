A fast-food worker in southern New Jersey has been caught on video viciously beating and kicking a mother in front of her young son as a group of people stood by and did nothing to help he. 

As bystanders watched and some recorded it on cell phones, the woman in a burgundy McDonald's uniform pummeled the mother and kicked her in the back along a trail in Salem on Tuesday night.

The suspect is also heard threatening to attack the victim's 2-year-old son, who repeatedly kicked the suspect's legs to stop her from hurting his mother.

Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem

Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times

Salem Police Chief John Pelura III said the attacker has been identified as 25-year-old Latia Harris. She remains at large.

Wanted: Latia Harris, 25, is facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats

According to Pelura, the 27-year-old victim told officers a woman named 'Tia' who works at McDonald's accused her of spreading rumors about her and her manager.

The victim has been treated at a hospital for her injuries.

Police obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. 

The graphic footage shows the McDonald's employee pounding another woman as a group of people stand around and watch in a wooded area behind the McDonald’s eatery on East Broadway in Salem. 

After the victim is thrown to the ground, the attacker proceeds to punch and kick her at least 20 times.

The woman's toddler tries to intervene on his mother's behalf by kicking her assailant and yelling at her to stop.

‘Mommy!’ the little boy cries out.

At one point, Harris threatens to beat up the 2-year-old.

No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her

‘You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams.

The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on the victim lying bleeding on the ground.

Before
 she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not 
over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.'  

Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood.

They found the 27-year-old bleeding 
profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was 
taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face. 

Chief Pelura said in a statement to 
MailOnline Thursday that criminal complaints have been signed against 
Harris for aggravated assault and two counts of terroristic threats, but
 she could face additional charges after her arrest.

Bail for Harris has been set at $35,000. One of the complaints stated that Harris threatened to shoot the 27-year-old mother.

According to the police chief, Harris has not returned to work since the Tuesday assault.

Ominous warning: The 25-year-old allegedly threatened to shoot the victim as payback for nearly getting her fired from McDonald's before she spat on her and walked away

Her last known address is currently vacant and police are working to identify family members and potential locations of Harris’ whereabouts.

'Police in this county deal with this type of violence everyday. Yet, this video is physically sickening to watch,' Pelura stated.

'There is a moral and social breakdown in the fabric of our society which is clearly evident when a woman gets pummeled in broad daylight in front of her child while a dozen people pull out their phones to record the incident instead of calling for help.'

He added: 'There is so little regard for human life - by the actor and the bystanders.'
