Career civil servant: Stephen Harrison received almost £260,000 in redundancy payments

Two bosses of a failed anti-fraud quango have been rewarded with payoffs worth almost £400,000.

The National Fraud Authority was accused of ignoring victims of conmen who rang its Action Fraud hotline, and of failing to get a grip on soaring levels of online crime.

It was shut down by Home Secretary Theresa May earlier this year so that elite police units could ‘strengthen the Government’s fight against economic crime’.

But now it can be revealed that  the two most senior figures in the organisation, which cost taxpayers £11.8 million last year, have been given massive voluntary redundancy payments.

Stephen Harrison, who served as the NFA’s chief executive from September 2011, received between £255,000 and £260,000 – on top of his £95,000 salary and £1,600  in perks.

The career civil servant, who spent 20 years in the Home Office, also left with a pension pot worth £509,000.

The NFA’s ‘director of knowledge’ Edward Nkune, meanwhile, was given a £120,000-£125,000 ‘golden goodbye’ to go with his £70,000 annual wage.

Mr Nkune, who previously worked at the Serious Fraud Office, has retirement funds worth £263,000.

The NFA was established only in 2008 by the Home Office and was devoted mainly to collating statistics on the scale of fraud in the UK.

It also set up the Action Fraud  hotline that left local police unable to take details of criminals.

But as The Mail on Sunday has 
reported, many victims say their plight was ignored by the call-centre 
staff who took their crime reports.

Only
 half of crimes reported to Action Fraud were ever passed on to police 
forces to investigate, and few of those were ever solved.

Matters were made worse still when BSS, the private company that ran the hotline, lost 2,500 reports because of IT problems.

Amid growing concern that cyber fraud was not being taken seriously enough, the NFA was shut down in March this year by the Home Secretary.

The National Crime Agency – dubbed Britain’s FBI – took over its strategic role while City of London Police assumed responsibility for the Action Fraud hotline in an attempt to ‘improve fraud reporting and analysis’.

However, an elected crime tsar fears that even after the costly reorganisation, victims are still not being supported and cases still not being investigated.

Martyn Underhill, the independent Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It really is time that this Government is held to account for its continuing failures in relation to fraud.

‘The NFA was a failing body and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money have been wasted on closing it.

‘Its successor continues to fail victims and continues to fail the public.’

The NFA’s final accounts stated that the voluntary redundancy payments made to both Mr Harrison and Mr Nkune were made  on ‘standard Civil Service compensation scheme terms’, based on their length of service.
