It is one of those magical moments a footballer seldom gets the chance to experience... a return to the place he once called home. And for Emile Heskey, a man maligned by many, Bolton's FA Cup fourth round trip to Liverpool provided an opportunity to prove himself at the highest level once more.

At 37 years of age, it is something Heskey himself admitted he never thought would happen. At the end of last season, he was plying his trade at Australian A-League side Newcastle Jets, meandering towards the end of his career.

But the big man had one last stint left in him. He wanted a move back to England, to play out his remaining season or two on home turf. Bolton gave him that opportunity, and alongside Eidur Gudjohnsen - himself 36 - he was tasked with leading the line in the FA Cup.

It is a cup competition that Heskey holds in high regard. In fact, he won it with Liverpool in 2001. Poetic that he should return to Anfield in perhaps his last season participating in it.

His reaction from the crowd pre-match was marvellous - and fully deserved. Anfield loves a returning hero, and four successful years at Liverpool have earned him respect on Merseyside.

In truth, Heskey's first-half contribution was minimal. He sat on Liverpool's back line, a relatively imposing three of Emre Can, Mamadou Sakho and Glen Johnson, waiting for his moment.

It would be unfair to expect a world-beating performance; those days are gone. Bolton were always going to be on the back-foot, playing on the break after stifling a Liverpool attack, and that proved to be the case.

His heat map shows exactly what you'd expect. A dark patch in the middle of Liverpool's half. And his aerial stats, too. 10 contests with a defender, six won. On the floor, he had 11 duels, and won seven of those.

He didn't set the game alight, but he provided a presence for Neil Lennon's side. Strength and power, attempting to hold the ball up for Gudjohnsen in behind him. 

Heskey has fond memories of his time at Liverpool, and is loved by the Anfield faithful

The former Liverpool man's overriding memory of the FA Cup will be winning it with Liverpool in 2001

Heskey will remember his return to Liverpool, and the reaction he received, for the rest of his life

It was the same in Liverpool's treble-winning season in 2001; Heskey teeing them up, and Michael Owen firing them home.

As for Heskey firing one home himself, it wasn't to be. There will have been millions watching from their sofas at home, wanting, waiting, wishing for the ex-England man to put one past Simon Mignolet.

Alas, his number was up after 56 minutes, Lennon revealing after the game that Heskey had felt a slight tweak in his hamstring. If more proof was needed of his status on the red half of Liverpool, the whole stadium were on their feet. A standing ovation for the man who evokes proud memories for the Anfield faithful. Memories of an FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup treble-winning campaign. Memories of 60 goals in a Liverpool shirt. Memories of that partnership with Owen.

There was no magical moment on Saturday night. Not even close. But it wasn't necessarily about that. It was a moment for Heskey to savour, and one that he deserves after a 21-year career.

That long round of applause as he left the Anfield pitch for perhaps the last time as a player is something that will stay with Heskey for the rest of his life.
