Steven Gerrard will likely face his first Stateside showdown with Frank Lampard when LA Galaxy host New York City in August.

The former England team-mates are set to come up against each other on Sunday, August 23 with the match due to kick off at the 27,000-capacity StubHub Center at 10pm UK time (2pm local).

Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in July after his contract with Liverpool expires, while Lampard's extended deal with Manchester City ends this summer.

Gerrard and Lampard will be on opposite sides at least once before this summer when Liverpool take on Manchester City in the Premier League at Anfield on Sunday, March 1.

The full fixture list for Major League Soccer's 20th landmark season was released on Wednesday with Gerrard's first possible appearance in an LA Galaxy shirt taking place on Independence Day when they take on Toronto FC on Saturday, July 4.

The 34-year-old will come across a familiar face on Saturday, July 25 when LA Galaxy travel to Owen Coyle 's Houston Dynamo.

The regular season begins on Friday, March 6 with champions LA Galaxy hosting Chicago Fire.

Gerrard will very much hope to be involved in the MLS Cup play-offs which are held from October 28 to early December.

Another intriguing fixture is Orlando City's season opener against New York City on March 8.

Orlando head coach Adrian Heath, the former Everton midfielder, last month stirred things up by having a pop at New York's relationship with Manchester City.

Heath said: 'We are looking forward to that Man City game - I mean New York.'
