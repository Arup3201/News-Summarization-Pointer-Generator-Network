This is where Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will wage violent combat on Saturday night.

The MGM Grand Garden Arena will also be the place where they add untold fortunes to their already significant wealth.

As for me, I’m just thrilled that I will be sitting at ringside.

On the safe side of the ropes rather than inside with either of the two greatest fighters on the planet.

The fight is expected to earn at least $300million (£195m) with Mayweather receiving $180m (£117) and Pacquiao $120m (£79m). 

The fight will attract a record amount of revenue from sponsorship, which is expected to add another $13.2million (£8.72m) to the mega-fight. 

Tecate have paid $5.6million to become the official beer and lead ring mat sponsor of the bout

Top Rank president Todd duBoef told ESPN.com that the five title sponsors for the event will chip in a total of $13.2m, roughly three times the previous highest amount.

Although exact records for sponsorship have not been kept, some Mayweather bouts from years gone by have attracted around $4m.

According to the report by ESPN, Tecate have paid $5.6m (£3.7m) to become the official beer of the fight and the main ring mat sponsor, beating the $5.2m (£3.44) bid from Corona.
