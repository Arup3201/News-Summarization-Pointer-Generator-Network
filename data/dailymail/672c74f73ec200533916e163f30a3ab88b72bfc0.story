Chinese authorities have found the German automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz guilty of manipulating the price of spare parts.

The authorities have launched an anti-monopoly crackdown and BMW, Audi and Chrysler are also likely to face penalties. The level of the punishment is yet to be decided.

The official Xinhua News Agency says that Mercedes-Benz took advantage of its position to supply replacement parts.

It is not just car makers but manufacturers in the pharmaceuticals, technology and food sectors that have also been investigated recently.

However, the European Chamber of Commerce in China said its members were wondering if they were being singled out.

The Xinhua report says that the prices were so steep that you could buy 12 cars for the parts needed for one Mercedes C-class car.

"Mercedes-Benz is a typical case of vertical price fixing - that is, the use of its dominant position in after-market parts to maintain price controls," said Zhou Gao, chief of the Jiangsu's anti-monopoly unit, according to Xinhua.

A Daimler spokesman said on Monday that the company was still "assisting" Chinese authorities, but was "unable to comment further on what is still an on-going matter".

Lexus, a part of the Toyota group, is also facing questions and General Motors has agreed to give the authorities more information on its business.
