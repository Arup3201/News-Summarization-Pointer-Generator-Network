Two off-duty police officers wearing animal onesies on their way to a fancy dress party made a detour to arrest a drunken yob.

West Midlands Police constables Terri Cave and Tracy Griffin were walking through Coventry dressed as a monkey and a zebra when they heard a drunk man allegedly yelling threatening abuse in a supermarket.

The officers sprang into action - still wearing their onesies - and wrestled the man to the ground once he left the Co-op shop.

The officers surprised colleagues at Solihull Police Station by carrying out the arrest while dressed as a zebra and a monkey

They restrained the man and called for help from their colleagues, who collected him in a Fiat Panda and took him a police station.

The pair's stunned colleagues tweeted: 'Off duty officers dressed in
zebra and monkey onesies arrest a violent man in the street - 
@SolihullPolice keeping you safe whatever it takes.

'Man threatening to kill people didn't expect to be wrestled to the 
ground by our off-duty officer in a zebra onesie. We go that extra 
mile.'

A man was arrested in connection with the incident and is due to make a second appearance at Coventry Magistrates' Court next month.
