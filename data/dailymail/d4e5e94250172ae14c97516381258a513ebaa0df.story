Nick Clegg today dismissed Prime Minister's Questions as a farce and called for it to be scrapped altogether.

The Lib Dem leader is so fed up with sitting silently next to David Cameron that he wants the Wednesday lunchtime session cancelled forever.

It is the strongest attack yet on the political institution by the Deputy Prime Minister, who says he feels 'ridiculous' being attacked by Labour and Tories with chance to fight back.

Mr Clegg has previously called for PMQs to be moved to a prime time slot so they can be shown on live TV to a large audience, instead of being aired at midday on Wednesday.

He has also suggested  allowing voters to send in questions to be answered by the Prime Minister.

But after almost five years of being forced to sit through David Cameron and Ed Miliband tearing chunks out of each other, he has had enough. 

Interviewed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Clegg said: 'How much (more) awkward can you get?'

Mr Clegg added: 'To have to sit to listen to your two main rivals tear strips off each other and you're not allowed to say anything.

'Of course it's awkward, it's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous, the whole thing should be scrapped. It's an absolute farce, Prime Minister's Questions.'

Mr Clegg said he has faced criticism throughout his time on the frontbench next to Mr Cameron.

At first he was seen as being too close to the Tories, then for looking glum and after missing the Autumn Statement last month was accused of snubbing Parliament.

He admitted that he plans to attend some sessions before the election in May, but not all.

Farce: Mr Clegg said he would not attend all of the final clashes between David Cameron and Ed Miliband ahead of the election in May

Asked whether he would be sitting next to Mr Cameron at PMQs right up until Parliament dissolves for the general election, Mr Clegg said: 'I sometimes will, I sometimes won't.

'Do I think that use of my time, sitting there biting my tongue as I listen to them say increasingly daft and shrill things to each other, do I think it's a great use of my time?

'No. Do I wish I didn't have to do it? Probably, quite a lot of the time. 

'At the beginning, apparently, I was criticised for being too comfortable, then I looked a bit sombre, then I looked too sad. And now if I show any expression it’s interpreted one way or the other…'

Mr Clegg became particularly animated during last week's PMQs, when Mr Cameron mocked the Lib Dems for being beaten by the Greens.

The Prime Minister said: 'We had a set of European elections last year, and Ukip and the Greens both beat the Liberal Democrats, I am afraid to say.'

It came as Mr Miliband accused the Tory leader of running scared from TV debates by insisting the greens took part. 

Mr Clegg was seen shouting: 'Excuses, excuses.'
