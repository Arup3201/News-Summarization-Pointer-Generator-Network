Holding a blade to his own throat, this was the moment a knifeman brought chaos to the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace yesterday.

Talhat Rehman, 54, of Harrow, has been charged with possessing a bladed weapon in public and affray, and will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court today. 

The middle-aged man walked through crowds of tourists clutching two large kitchen knives before police surrounded him and used a Taser stun gun to disarm him.

As a policeman shouted a warning call of ‘Taser, Taser, Taser’ to his colleagues, the knifeman allegedly lunged forward, brandishing a six-inch blade in a series of swipes, before falling to the floor as he was stunned by the electrical charge.

Scary: The dramatic incident saw the 54-year-old brandish two knives in front of hundreds of terrified tourists last February

Down: The knifeman charged towards a police officer outside Buckingham Palace who fired a taser gun at him

A video showed Mr Rehman 
shouting and holding the knife to his throat as he walked past the 
Victoria Memorial, towards the gates of the palace.

Police officers 
shouted to tourists to keep away from the man as they raced to surround 
him.

The Harrow man, who clutched a
 set of wooden beads and wore a flat woollen hat similar to the pakuls 
traditionally worn by men in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, was 
later arrested.

The drama 
unfolded as crowds gathered outside the palace before the midday 
Changing of the Guard ceremony, one of London’s most popular tourist 
attractions.

Witnesses described seeing the bespectacled man breaking 
through a barrier and walking towards the palace before he was stopped 
and surrounded by police.

Police response: Twitter user Josh Greenberg also posted this picture from outside Buckingham Palace

Eyewitness Kevin Burrows, 33, said: ‘He had a knife in each hand.

‘The police were on him in seconds, he didn’t have a chance of getting close to anyone.

‘They
 surrounded him, they were telling him to calm down, and then a 
policeman Tasered him.’  Mr Burrows, a kitchen porter from Surbiton, 
Surrey, added: ‘The police were fantastic, it was all over in minutes. 
The procession was diverted away from him and the band just kept 
playing.’

Another witness, 
Grant Shepherd, filmed the incident and put it on YouTube. He described 
the scene in a Twitter message, saying: ‘Crazy man with a knife to his 
throat just stopped the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.’

The
 Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were at Sandringham but were understood
 to have been informed about the drama. Scotland Yard is responsible for
 security at the palace and armed officers maintain a round-the-clock 
presence there, even when members of the Royal Family are not in 
residence.

Police cordoned off the area where the Taser was fired, some 30 yards from the palace gates.

The
 man, who has not been named, was checked by medics and arrested on 
suspicion of affray. Shocked tourists said police told them the man 
could have ‘mental health issues’.

In
 June 1982 an intruder armed with a knife managed to get on to the 
palace forecourt before he was stopped.

A month later Michael Fagan got 
inside the Queen’s private chambers while the monarch was still in bed.
