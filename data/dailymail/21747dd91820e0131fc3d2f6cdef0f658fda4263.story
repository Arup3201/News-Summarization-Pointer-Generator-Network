A Chechen warlord who had urged his followers to attack the Olympic Games has been killed, it has been reported.

Doku Umarov, who threatened to attack the Games in Sochi, Russia, is dead according to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov who wrote the unverified claims on his Instagram account.

Kadyrov has made the claims a number of times in the past and no proof has been submitted to verify his death.

Dead? Doku Umarov is reported to have been killed by Russian secret services

News of Umarov's death came from intercepted communications between rebel leaders who were discussing his replacement, according to Kadyrov.

However CBS News reports he didn't say when the conversation was or how he had the information. But messages appearing to confirm the claims have appeared on Chechen jihadist web forums and an audio recording of Islamic sharia judge Abu Mohammed Ali Daghestani, who is linked to Umarovâ€™s movement, also confirmed the news.

Bloggers on militant Chechen sites say he was killed in a Russion Special Forces operation but there has been no time or place revealed for the alleged attack.

Kadyrov, says his followers are trying to find a replacement to Umarov and they will not pose a threat to the Olympics on February 7.

'That's why all the talks about the threat to Sochi are absolutely groundless,' he told CBS News. The Interfax news agency has also quoted an unidentified source in Russian security agencies saying they cannot confirm the death.

Umarov is the leader of the Caucasus Emirate, an alliance of rebel groups. They want to create an independent Islamic state in Russia's North Caucasus.

The warlord has claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Moscow's Domodedovo airport in 2011 that killed 37 people and injured 180 as well as two suicide bombings in March 2010 that killed 40 people and injured 120.
