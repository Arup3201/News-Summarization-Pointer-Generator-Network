It is one of the irritations of modern life. But forking out for printer cartridges may soon be a thing of the past.

Epson has launched a cartridge-free printer that uses a refillable ink tank.

The machine is the first of its kind in Britain, and the printer manufacturer claims it will cost a fraction of the price to fill it with ink.

Tokyo-based electronics company Epson has unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges. In place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir. This can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill. Two printers are on sale, the L355 at £249.99 and the L555 (shown) at £329.99

How the costs compare of a traditional cartridge wifi printer and a new Eco-tank printer 

The catch is that you will have to pay a lot more for the printer – but Epson says it will still work out cheaper in the longer term. Calculations suggest the saving could be more than £100 a year.

Until now manufacturers have sold their printers on the cheap, relying on the exorbitant cost of the inkjet cartridges to make a profit.

Those cartridges – of which Britons buy 50million a year – contain as little as 3ml of ink. And with many printers needing four cartridges, it can cost £45 to refill them.

Both the L355 and L555 have print, copy and scanning functionality.

The L555 also has fax, a 30-page Automatic Document Feeder and a two-line LCD screen.

They both have Wi-Fi connectivity that can be used with Epson iPrint on smartphones or tablets.

Meanwhile the refillable ink tank system, which can print 4,000 pages in black and 6,500 in colour when full, also comes with an Epson warranty of one year or 30,000 pages.

But fewer households now own a printer, instead choosing to share photographs and documents on the internet rather than printing them.

As a result, the big firms have had to rethink their commercial model, because if people are buying fewer cartridges, firms will not make as much money on them. Epson claims its new EcoTank printers will last two years without running out of ink – based on a household printing 200 pages a month – and will then cost up to £32 to refill. But the tank adds about 25 per cent to the size of the printer. And the printer is more expensive.

While a traditional cartridge wifi printer costs £55, the EcoTank L355 retails at £249 and the more advanced L555 at £329. But Mark Reynolds, of Epson, claimed the new system will save the average family a large amount in the long run.

‘We estimate up to 65 per cent savings versus the average across the top ten printers in Western Europe,’ he said. Over two years, this would equate to savings of about £500 per machine, taking into account the initial outlay, he claimed. But by the Daily Mail’s calculations, comparing the Epson EcoTank L355 with the firm’s popular inkjet model, the Epson XP-312 which sells for £55, that saving would be closer to £230.

The new printers come with wifi connection, scanner and copier, with the L555 also including a fax.

When using the printer for the first time the user will need to pour the ink themselves into the printer’s tank (shown). Epson says this is ‘hassle-free’ using drip-free bottle spouts. Once depleted refills can be bought for £8 - but it has to be Epson's own brand of ink

Purchasing replacement ink cartridges (stock image shown) for existing printers can be a costly and complex process, so the new refillable printers will be welcome new to many
