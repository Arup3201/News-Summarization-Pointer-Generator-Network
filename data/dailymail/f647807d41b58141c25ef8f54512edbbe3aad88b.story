Who said facing German opposition spells doom for Barclays Premier League teams? After a chastening week for England’s finest, Everton emphatically restored pride here last night.

If Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal were left red-faced following their meetings with the Bundesliga’s leading lights, Everton had no such problems at Goodison Park, blitzing Wolfsburg to announce their return to Europe in the grand style. 

From first whistle to last, Everton impressed, attacking with menace and defending stoically when questions were asked of them. The margin of victory — courtesy of an own goal and strikes from Seamus Coleman, Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas — was fitting reward.

Match facts from DOMINIC KING at Goodison Park

Everton remain unbeaten against German sides and that record was never in danger here. Crucially, victory puts them in the driving seat in Group H. Martinez believes his team will thrive in the Europa League and this display supported that view. 

‘It was a phenomenal feeling,’ said Martinez. ‘Our work rate was magnificent and we were clinical when it was needed. The teams were evenly matched and maybe the score did not reflect the game but we are delighted. I was so impressed. We looked mature.’

An idea of how much importance Martinez had put on this game came in his team sheet. It has always been his intention to take this tournament seriously and he selected the same team that had beaten West Brom 2-0 at The Hawthorns last Saturday.

With a big crowd at Goodison crackling in anticipation – this famous old stadium looked a picture under the floodlights – the stage was set for Everton to deliver and though there were a couple of early, anxious moments, they soon found their stride.

Gareth Barry and James McCarthy ensured they had plenty of the ball and soon Everton’s passing and movement started pulling Wolfsburg players out of position; in the 14th minute, a flowing counterattack resulted in them taking the lead, albeit with a hint of good fortune.

Naismith started the move, ushering the ball out to Baines, who scampered forward menacingly; he increased the tempo, exchanging a one-two with McCarthy before playing in Naismith. The Scot did the rest, applying the finish via a deflection off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. 

If his first year at Everton was unremarkable, the past 12 months have been a roaring success and Naismith could comfortably be described as the biggest beneficiary of the Martinez era. He has blossomed from sporadic substitute to regular starter.

That goal immediately settled any nerves but it did not necessarily mean Everton had things all their own way. Wolfsburg have quality and they tried to cause problems, not least through the former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne.

Everton, however, got their tails up and key men started ticking. Mirallas and Baines, especially, had an influence and those two were heavily involved as they got the goal on the stroke of half-time that provided a crucial buffer.

Mirallas seized possession on the edge of the area and Benaglio could not deal with his dipping shot, parrying it only as far as Baines, who had followed in. His cross-cum-shot skidded off the floor and Coleman applied the finishing touch, heading in unmarked from four yards.

On the touchline, Martinez celebrated in his usual manner, punching the air with one arm, the other folded around his waist, and smiling broadly. It was a big moment in this game. Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking called his team “naïve”; Everton were on the front foot.

Mirallas broke away late in the game to score Everton's fourth goal before Rodriguez netted a consolation free kick

Immediately after the restart, the hosts had extinguished any hope of a comeback. When Robin Knoche dithered, Aidan McGeady darted forward but his run was crudely halted by Knoche and, after some deliberation – the initial foul looked outside the area – a penalty was awarded.

Up stepped Baines and he took his record to 18 successful conversions from 19 penalties when sending Benaglio the wrong way and Mirallas completed the demolition in the final minute, when he raced on to pass from substitute Darron Gibson.

‘The environment was incredible,' said Martinez. ‘We had a bit of everything, we were well organised, we carried a good threat. We have had some magnificent tests so far and we have a great platform to build on.’

Though Ricardo Rodriguez scored a consolation with a thumping free-kick, the mood could not be altered. Goodison revelled at being back on this stage.
