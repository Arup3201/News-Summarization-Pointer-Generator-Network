Comedy actor James Corden could barely hide his delight when he turned up to a charity football match in Bedford and bumped into the man who inspired one his most popular TV characters.

The comedy actor based his character Neil 'Smithy' Smith from Gavin & Stacey, a beer drinking builder on a real life 41-year-old dad of three called Neil 'Smithy' Smith.

Smithy - the real life one - had been close friends with Corden's cousin Lee Andrews for over 30 years and their friendship gave Corden his inspiration to create comedy gold.

The pair met up unexpectedly in Bedford recently when they both played in a charity football match.

In the popular BBC show, art imitated life when Corden made Neil and Lee's legendary scrapes  a part of his show. 

Smith told The Mirror: ' Some of the stuff me and Lee got up to in our twenties probably couldn't be shown on TV.'

'I think James saw a good craic with how we used to be. We were inseparable, just like Smithy and Gavin in the show.'

He added that when the show first aired all of his friends kept texting and talking about the resemblance to his character.

Smith said he tends to enjoy watching football, a drink and  a good laugh and can see why James thought it would make a good character for television.

Luckily the real life Smithy thought that his on stage alter ego was hilarious.

He recalls that when the pair first met he was already taking on roles in adverts and soap operas.

But he praised him for being 'a normal guy' who is very down to earth.

Corden who is close friends with David 
Beckham, a BAFTA  winner and one of the country's most treasured comedy 
actors puled on his T-shirt and played at the match.

The match, for the opening of a new Salvation Army pitch was planned by his late uncle Roger Collins.

Smithy said he was delighted to be playing alongside the award winning actor.

Corden, in turn, praised his muse Smithy saying he was a great guy and he hoped that the character that he had created based off him had done him proud.
