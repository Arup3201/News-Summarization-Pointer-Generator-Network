Shocking security camera footage released by the NYPD shows the moment a music video shoot descended into violence when one rapper shot his 'best friend' five times before pistol whipping him as he lay on the ground on Saturday.

After the vicious argument has been settled, five people step over the 37-year-olds twitching body as they attempt to leave following the disturbing attack and not one of them stops to help the victim.

According to owner Ali Abdul, speaking to the New York Daily News, 'They were fighting over who’s the star, who’s better. They were drunk. They spit at each other then one guy pulled out a gun and shot the other guy five times.'

No mercy: The rap-rival pistol-whips his friend after shooting him on the floor

The shooting suspect, wearing a red polo shirt with jeans and baseball cap, doesn't even put the drink he is holding in his right hand down while he fires at least three times at the victim, who falls to the floor.

Not content with unleashing a barrage of bullets against the unidentified victim, the suspect who also has braided hair, is seen to viciously pistol-whip his 'friend' while he lies on the floor.

Then, in a heartless twist, five other men who were in the store at the time are seen to walk over the victim without offering to help or provide assistance.

Paramedics arrived shortly after the store was vacated by the six men and the victim was rushed to Lincoln Hospital, where he remained in a critical condition on Monday.

The argument reportedly began during the filming of a rap video in the Bronx at E.170th St. on Saturday morning.

Police have yet to announce what the argument was over and if any of the people who ignored the plight of the victim were connected with the suspect.
