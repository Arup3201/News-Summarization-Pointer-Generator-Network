House of Commons Speaker John Bercow faced calls for an official inquiry last night over why he gave a Parliamentary pass to a friend of his wife – who later donated thousands of pounds to his re-election campaign.

Wealthy businesswoman Farah Sassoon was given the pass – which allows full unescorted access to the Palace of Westminster – two years ago.

She is a friend and drinking partner of Mr Berow’s wife, Sally, and was pictured cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow last year.

Mrs Sassoon’s company, Trust Reservations, has also donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’ s 2015 campaign in his Buckingham seat.

The donation this year from the conference and hotel booking company became public when Mr Bercow lodged it in the official register of MPs' interests.

Last night former Tory Party vice chairman Michael Fabricant said: ‘I’m sure the Speaker would welcome an inquiry in to this matter in order to clear his name.’

And former Transport Minister Simon Burns said: ‘I do not quite see why at the request of the wife of the Speaker a friend should be given a pass to the House of Commons – in that they are not usually given to MPs’ friends.

‘It makes it look rather difficult for the Speaker when he then receives a rather nice cheque for his elelction campaign – and leaves him open to criticism and questions.’

Details of the donation to Mr Bercow’s election campaign emerged over the weekend.

Then, on Tuesday, the Tory MP for Reading East, Rob Wilson, wrote to the Speaker asking him a series of questions about the pass and demanding ‘transparency’.

In a statement, the Speaker’s office confirmed Mrs Bercow applied for a pass for a ‘female friend’ in 2012. A spokesman said it was ‘not unusual for residents living on the parliamentary estate to be able to apply for passes for close friends and family’.

She pointed out that Mrs Sassoon’s donation was made on June 7 2014, and that it was accepted three weeks’ later.

However, the statement did not address the question lodged by Mr Wilson of whether Mr Bercow consulted with the Parliamentary authorities – including the Clerk of the Commons - on the ‘propriety’ of accepting a donation having issued the pass.

A parliamentary pass gives the holder full access to the high-security Palace of Westminster estate. 

Passes are given to MPs, their aides and journalists and staff who work in the Commons and the Lords.

They allow the holder to wander unaccompanied around the estate and eat and drink in its restaurants and bars. Anyone applying for one must go through extensive security checks.

Mrs Sassoon came to public attention last year when she was pictured draping her leg across Mrs Bercow's lap in a cab while the pair were on a night out after awards ceremony for gay magazine Attitude at the Royal Courts of Justice.

Mrs Sassoon is married to hotelier Peter Sassoon Munns, and her daughter Sophia is an actress and model who starred in the reality TV show Made In Chelsea.

She is listed as a director of Trust Reservations, and has donated more than £40,000 to Labour, including £4,200 to Ed Miliband's leadership campaign in 2010.

In his letter to the Speaker, Mr Wilson said he was raising concerns highlighted by several constituents.

He wrote: 'Integrity, accountability and openness, are part of the seven Nolan Principles of Public Life which are enshrined into Parliament by their inclusion in the Code of Conduct for MPs.'

Mr Wilson also raised the prospect of writing to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about the issue.
