With vivid green and purple streaks lighting up the night sky these breathtaking images look more like a collection of artwork than a set of photographs.

But the stunning splashes of colour across the star-speckled sky are one of nature's most breathtaking phenomenon - the aurora borealis at its best.

The naturally occurring light show is thought to be nearing the peak of an 11 year solar cycle affording viewers the best possible conditions to catch them at their beautiful best.

The set of stunning pictures was captured by New York photographer Steven Kazlowski who had travelled to snow covered Alaska to view it.

Breathtaking: Steven, 44, travelled to Alaska's Cleary Point and North Slope to witness the cosmic ballet

Steven said: 'I find the aurora 
borealis to be otherworldly - it's an amazing sky light show that 
happens as a natural phenomenon.

'Even when you see them you don't believe it, they are so incredible, even magical.

'As quickly as they flare up, they also disappear.

'I've been photographing them on and off when opportunity has allowed over the last 20 years.'

At one of the locations for his pictures, Steven spent the night alone in freezing temperatures to get these incredible shots.

Steven, 44, travelled to Alaska's Cleary Point and North Slope to witness the lights.

At their best: NASA scientists predict that the peak time to see the lights for the next decade will come in December thanks to a 'solar flip' - a complete reversal of the sun's polar magnetic fields

Unusual: The Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the atmosphere and emit burning gasses on entry which produce different coloured lights

Breathtaking: The lights are perhaps one of the most photographed naturally occuring phenomenon

He
said: 'Seeing it up close creates a euphoric feeling in one's life - 
it's an amazing enough feeling that people will stay up all night in 
cold weather to get to view them.'

Steven added: 'There are varying theories about how the colour is created. The pink lights are a lot more rare than the green.

'Anytime you see a strong aurora it's a pretty unique site to see.'

The phenomenon is named after the Roman godess of dawn.

A similar phenomenon in the southern hemisphere is known as the aurora australis.
