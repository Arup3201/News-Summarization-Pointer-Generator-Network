A 20-year-old Southern Methodist University (SMU) student has been charged with raping another student in a campus dorm.

Donald Samuel Cuba, of La Grange Park, Illinois was recently arrested in connection with the alleged rape of a fellow SMU student in February.

He was released from Dallas County jail after posting a $15,000 bond on September 10.

This is the first case where a grand jury has charged a SMU student for sexually
assaulting another student, reports the Fort Worth Weekly.

The university has traditionally relied on a system of secret hearings for students suspected of sexual assault

'This case might be one of the first, if not the first of its kind to 
make it this far in the criminal justice system,' said Erin Hendricks, chief 
prosecutor in the district attorney’s Sexual Assault Unit from 2007 
until 2010.

In February, SMU police issued a crime alert that a student had reported that she was sexually assaulted during the early hours of Feb 10 by a 'student acquaintance' in a dorm at the Smith Hall campus.

Officials referred the report to SMU’s internal judicial system. The first panel (three students, a faculty member and a staff member) found Cuba guilty of sexual assault, according to two sources close to the investigation.

After Cuba filed an appeal of that ruling, a second panel (three students, two faculty members and two staff members) found Cuba not guilty.

The accuser then appealed the second panel’s not-guilty finding, an effort 
that eventually resulted in last week’s indictment of Cuba.

Exactly how the case reached the district attorney’s office is not clear. In most cases, police departments and other law enforcement agencies 
refer criminal cases for prosecution along with an offense report 
describing the alleged crime.

However, judicial officials said that in the Cuba case, the district 
attorney’s office referred the case to the grand jury and that there is 
no offense report from the SMU Police Department.

Over the past 25 years, more than 100 SMU students have reported being 
sexually assaulted. Yet in only one
case - the three men who raped Monika Korra in 2009 - were the suspects
successfully prosecuted and they were not SMU students. 

SMU officials say the system - where all records are kept secret - works well. 'The university is confident in the integrity of its process and its procedures,' said SMU spokesperson Kent Best.

Serious questions have been raised in the past about the fairness of the university’s approach.

In 1990, a secret panel found an SMU student guilty of sexually assaulting another SMU student only to have a second panel overrule that decision in 1991, a decision upheld by then-President A. Kenneth Pye.

Best said university officials couldn’t comment on student conduct matters.
