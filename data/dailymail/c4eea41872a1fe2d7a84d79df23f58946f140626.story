Mark Pougatch is to replace Adrian Chiles at ITV's lead football host with immediate effect.

Pougatch will present ITV's next live match which is the Chelsea vs Paris Saint-Germain Champions League game next month.

ITV will not comment on the reasons for Chiles' departure.

Chiles was the subject of a Facebook campaign to have him removed from ITV's football coverage after last year's World Cup, and last summer it was announced he was being given a much bigger role on BBC Radio 5 Live as a presenter. 

The decision follows ITV choosing not to renew their current second presenter Matt Smith's contract at the end of the season, while pundit Andy Townsend recently left by mutual consent.

ITV also lost Roy Keane as a pundit when he decided to focus on his coaching duties prior to the start of the World Cup.

It's understood that Chiles was told this week that ITV wanted to terminate his one-year contract extension that was signed shortly before the World Cup last year.

It was a one-year deal worth around £500,000  just to host football. He had had to take a £1million cut in salary at that time as he was no longer hosting the doomed Daybreak breakfast show.

The fact ITV will make no comment about Chiles' shock departure points to a likely legal battle over the terms of his pay-off.

ITV, who employed Chiles on hugely extravagant terms, finally came to the conclusion that he wasn't the football presenter they wanted going forward.

Pougatch will continue to work for 5 Live but will cut down his football commitments to ensure there is no conflict with his new role on ITV.

He ironically was in competition with Chiles for the anchor role when BBC first launched Match of the Day 2.

After being confirmed as ITV's new lead presenter, Pougatch said in a statement: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining ITV and to be given this great opportunity.

'I'm looking forward to working with ITV's talented pool of commentators and pundits on some of the very best football there is.'

ITV Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said: 'Mark is a highly-respected sports journalist and an outstanding broadcaster. We're delighted to welcome Mark to the ITV Sport team.'

Although the reasons for Chiles' departure remain unclear, ITV's reduction in staff may be linked to their dwindling broadcast rights.

Their FA Cup deal ended last season, while they will not show live Champions League or Europa League games until at least 2019 after losing out on the rights to BT Sport.

They will, however, show highlights from both competitions, while continuing to broadcast all of England's home and away matches, both friendlies and qualifiers.

Chiles, who earned £4.1million last year, was no stranger to controversy during his four-and-a-half year spell at ITV, often drawing criticism from viewers.

In October 2013 there were calls for him to be sacked after he made a potentially offensive remark at the end of England's win against Montenegro.

Chiles said: 'And it’s practically a home game for Poland – 15,000 Poles will be in here, I’m sure.'

And in February of last year he told viewers that had not fallen asleep at half-time in extra-time of Fulham's FA Cup clash with Sheffield United that he would 'send them a fiver' if they wrote in.

The comment led to plenty of activity on social media, with viewers taking to Twitter to demand money from the presenter.

Mark Pougatch has joined ITV Sport as a presenter for the channel's football coverage.

Mark joins the ITV Sport team as the Champions League and Europa League enter their knockout rounds and England's Euro 16 qualifying stages are set to resume.

He will appear alongside ITV's panel of pundits, commentary and reporting team for the live England international and European football programmes from February.

He brings with him a wealth of experience in sports broadcasting over 20 years, including presenting major events such as World Cups, European Championships and the Olympics.

Mark said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining ITV and to be given this great opportunity. I'm looking forward to working with ITV's talented pool of commentators and pundits on some of the very best football there is.'

ITV Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said: 'Mark is a highly-respected sports journalist and an outstanding broadcaster. We're delighted to welcome Mark to the ITV Sport team.'

ITV will show exclusive live coverage of all England's European Championship and World Cup qualifying matches and friendlies, both home and away fixtures, until 2018. ITV also holds the rights to show Champions League and Europa League matches and highlights until the end of the 2014/2015 season, after which it will show Champions League and Europa League highlights.

Mark will continue to present sports programmes for BBC Radio 5 Live and PLTV while in his ITV role.
