The woman who has accused Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov of assault and kidnapping her told reporters on Thursday that he laughed as he beat her at their Denver apartment.

Russian native Evgeniya Vavrinyuk, 24, who spoke through an interpreter, said Varlamov had been drinking for more than 12 hours before he attacked her.

‘He was having fun, he was laughing,’ said the model. ‘He has no concept of when to stop drinking, and when he drinks he turns into an animal.’

Evgeniya Vavrinyuk told investigators that Varlamov kicked her in the chest, knocking her down, and stomped on her chest as she lay on the ground in her apartment on Monday, according to an arrest affidavit

Semyon Varlamov, 25, starting goaltender for the Colorado Avalanche, appeared in court on Thursday on kidnapping and assault charges in a domestic incident involving his girlfriend

Vavrinyuk had been dating Varlamov for a year. He has been arrested for allegedly beating up his on-again, off-again 
model girlfriend in what authorities are calling a domestic violence 
incident.

She described in court how her 6-foot-2, 209-pound goalie
boyfriend kicked her in the chest and stomped on her as she lay on the ground, before he dragged her by her hair from their bedroom in the early hours of Monday morning.

She pointed to her chest, arms, stomach, neck and head - places she said she are bruised. She also said he kicked her out of the apartment, reports The Denver Post.

Vavrinyuk admitted it wasn't the first time that her boyfriend had hurt her, but throwing her out on the street was ‘the final straw.’

A judge set Varlamov's bond at $5,000 and issued a restraining order for his girlfriend

‘She
wants to make sure he is punished for this,’ Vavrinyuk said through 
Diana Senova, an interpreter and the fiancee of her attorney, Robert 
Abrams.

‘(Varlamov) is 
very arrogant and thinks he can get away with anything, that he can beat
her up and no one will ever know about it.’

She
said her boyfriend had beat her at least four times before in other 
countries, but she had remained hopeful that he could change, as she 
loved him and wanted to have children with him.

She
said she broke a modeling contract in Hong Kong so she could come to 
Denver to be with him ‘because he asked her to,’ Senova said.

Varlamov,
25, turned himself into police on Wednesday evening, after practicing 
with the team that day. He was arrested on suspicion of second-degree 
kidnapping and third-degree assault.

According to news reports, Varlamov and Vavrinyuk, known to her friends as ‘Evie,’ have been in a rocky four-term relationship disrupted by breakups.

Vague: John Rotole, the attorney for Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, told reports that he will defend his client in court

His agent, Paul Theofanous, said Varlamov ‘is completely innocent of all of these charges.’

The
Avalanche said in a statement they were aware of the allegations but 
wouldn’t comment further until the conclusion of the investigation.

Acquired
from Washington in a 2011 trade, Varlamov is 7-1 this season with a 
1.76 goals-against average. Last year, the goaltender earned $3million.

According to court documents made public on Thursday, Varlamov then told her in Russian that 'if this were Russia, he would have beaten her more,'

The NHL star appeared in a Denver courtroom on Thursday dressed in an orange jail garb.

A judge set his bond at $5,000 and issued a restraining order for his girlfriend. Varlamov also was given permission to travel with his team. If convicted, Varlamov could face two to six years in prison.

The alleged lovers' quarrel took placed on Monday at the couple’s apartment in the 1700 block of Bassett Street in Denver.

Varlamov’s arrest warrant and affidavit state that the 25-year-old athlete held his girlfriend’s face to the floor, grabbed her by her arms and shook her before pushing her down to the floor.

'Her statement is that this is the most minor of the beatings she received. She's received five in all, and the last one was to unconsciousness,' said Vavrinyuk's attorney Robert Abrams.

Abrams said his client spent five hours in a hospital after Monday's beating.

‘This time Evie said to us, “That’s it, go lock him up,”’ Abrams said. ‘This girl is 5-foot-3, 100-and-nothing pounds; he’s a 6-foot-2, 210-pound professional athlete. This is a very sizable force approaching you. This is terrifying.’

Varlamov’s father, Alexander, downplayed the domestic violence case and came to his son's defense in an interview with Russia's R-Sport.

'I can only say one thing with complete responsibility: No crime has been committed whatsoever,' he stated, adding that his son has ‘no serious issues.’

It has been widely speculated that Varlamov is expected to be invited as the starting goalie for the Russian Olympic team during the Winter Games in Sochi next year.

In light of his arrest, some Russian officials wasted no time accusing the United State of sabotage.

Stunner: The Russian model told police in Denver that her boyfriend struck her in the chest and warned her in Russian that were they back home, he would have given her a harsher beating

State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, called Varlamov's arrest a 'sports and political move.'

‘The main goal is to suspend him from training and games so that he loses practice and misses the Olympics,’ said Ananskikh.

The LDPR member has vowed to use his sway as the head of the Russian parliament's physical training and sports committee to 'influence the situation.'

According to the Russian tabloid Dni.ru, Varlamov and the blonde fashion model called it quits at least once before, but the woman, who resides mostly in Russia, returned to Denver for a three-month stay and moved back in with him.

In response to Varlamov's arrest, the model wrote on her Russian social media account VKontakte, which has since been deleted: 'If a man has raised his hand against a woman - he will do it again. And no amount of oaths and assurances should shake a woman's resolve.’

Rising star: Varlamov is among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage

She went on saying: ‘Break up with these men instead of feeling sorry for them!'

According to the hockey player's father, his son's only crime was that he decided to take his girlfriend out to the movies ‘against her will,’ and she rushed to press charges against him, Russian Gazette reported.  

Conspiracy theory: State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh claims that Varlamov's arrest is an act of sabotage ahead of the Winter Olympics

The Avalanche play at Dallas Friday night and Varlamov was scheduled to start. His backup, Jean-Sebastien Giguere, has been just as good in net, recording two shutouts.

Varlamov is in the midst of a resurgent season under new coach Patrick Roy and a staff that includes goalie guru Francois Allaire, who once mentored Roy and Giguere.

Between Roy and Allaire, they’ve restored Varlamov’s confidence a year after he allowed three goals a game. Varlamov said he credits his improvement to Allaire altering his form in goal. Just minor tweaks, he said, but wouldn’t elaborate on the specifics of what they were.

Whatever was changed, it has been paying off as he’s among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage.

After practice Wednesday, Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson said it was ‘pretty cool to see Varly transition into an elite NHL goalie.’
