Andrea Atzeni will be the new first jockey to Qatar Racing next year after replacing Jamie Spencer, who retires at the end of the season.

He will be joined at the racing organisation of Sheikh Fahad Al Thani and his brothers by teenage sensation and runaway apprentice title leader Oisin Murphy, who has also been contracted to ride for the operation.

The appointment of the pair was predicted by Racemail.

Time to go: Jamie Spencer is retiring from as first jockey at Qatar Racing, allowing Atzeni to come in

Also being shown the exit door at Qatar Racing is their second jockey Harry Bentley.

While the changes are being dressed up as a change of structure within Qatar Racing, with 34-year-old Spencer taking up a management role, it seems clear that the current team of jockeys are paying the price for a moderate season for Sheik Fahad with his expensively assembled team.

Bentley admitted as much when saying in his Racing UK column: 'I had been retained by Qatar Racing for two years so to part company after that period is naturally going to take a little time to sink in.

'There has been a reshuffle, with Jamie Spencer retiring, and questions have no doubt been asked after what has been a quiet season for Qatar Racing. '

The appointments of Atzeni, 23, and Murphy, 18, will mean a completely fresh riding roster for Qatar Racing in 2015 and Sheik Fahad has certainly invested in two of the Weighing Room's brightest young takents.

David Redvers, Racing and Bloodstock Manager to Qatar Racing, said: 'With Jamie retiring and Harry concluding his two-year contract, Sheik Fahad is delighted to have secured the services of Andrea and Oisin for Qatar Racing.

'He has also asked me to reiterate his gratitude to both Jamie and Harry for all of their hard work, skill and professionalism.'

During his two-year contract, Bentley rode stakes winners for Qatar Racing, most recently a Listed win on Valonia last weekend, and was runner-up in both the British and Irish 1,000 Guineas on Lightning Thunder, as well as being crowned champion jockey in Qatar.

Redvers added: 'Andrea and Oisin have impressed us greatly this season and we are delighted to agree terms with them to take effect from the start of 2015.'

Atzeni said: 'I feel very privileged to have been asked to ride as first jockey for Qatar Racing. I am excited at the prospect and look forward to repaying the faith Sheikh Fahad and his brothers have shown in appointing me.'

Qatar Racing currently has around 250 horses in training worldwide, the majority of which are based in Britain, Ireland and France, as well as horses in Germany, Australia and USA.
