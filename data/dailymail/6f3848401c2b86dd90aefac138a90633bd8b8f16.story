A former medical student who murdered his roommate with poison and then tried to pass it off as an April Fool's joke gone wrong has lost his appeal against the death sentence.

Lin Senhao, 28, a former master’s student at Shanghai Medical College, was convicted last February of the intentional homicide of Huang Yang, who was 27.

Mr Huang died of multiple organ failure in April 2013 after swallowing a toxic chemical that Lin had placed inside a water cooler in their halls.

Impassive: Lin Senhao stands for his appeal at the Shanghai Higher People's Court in Shanghai, where his death sentence for the lethal poisoning of his university room-mate was upheld

A post-mortem revealed that he had been poisoned with the toxic chemical N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA).

After Lin's death sentence was upheld today, his father was seen breaking down outside court. Surrounded by reporters and cameramen, he dropped to his knees and held his head in his hands. 

At his original trial in November 2013, Lin confessed to poisoning the water, but insisted he never intended to kill Mr Huang.

The Global Times reported that prosecutors rejected Lin's argument, claiming he was familiar with the effects of the chemical he put in the water as he had used it in experiments on laboratory animals.

'The defendant Lin Senhao committed intentional homicide by poisoning due to trivialities. The method was ruthless, the harm to society was great, the crime extremely serious,' the court said in a statement.

Prosecutors asserted that Lin killed Mr Huang because of a grudge he held over 'trivial daily matters'.

Lin's lawyers argued against any intention, claiming 'trivial daily matters' were not enough for Lin to commit the murder. In addition, they said he would have used a different chemical if it was his intention to kill due to NDMA's strong odour.

Lin stated he was prompted to do the prank after Mr Huang announced his own plan to trick someone on April Fool's Day but added that he only wanted to cause Mr Huang some discomfort.

Still, his understanding of NDMA was believed to be extensive after he published several articles with descriptions of experiments with the chemical in national academic journals, including measuring lethal volumes in mice.

Lin put at least 30 grams - 10 times the fatal does for an adult man of Mr Huang's size - of the chemical in the water dispensers on March 31, 2013, at about 5.50pm.

Prosecutors said Lin had taken the chemical from an experiment at the hospital on the same day.

NDMA is primarily used for research and according to the US Environmental Protection Agency exposure in humans may cause liver damage and affect the blood.

After drinking the toxic water on April Fool's Day, Mr Huang was hospitalised. He was later transferred to intensive care with liver failure, plunging blood platelets and fever.

Lin examined Mr Huang on the morning of April 2 and told him there was nothing wrong with his liver. Lin even visited Mr Huang in hospital. Mr Huang's condition was undiagnosed for eight days after drinking the chemical. 

Lin's other roommate, Ge Jungi, not a resident in the dorm at the time, remembered Lin had written articles about the chemical.

When police found the chemical in the water dispenser and arrested Lin, he confessed. Police also found Lin had searched murder cases involving fatal doses on his laptop from April 1 to April 4.

China's top court must review death sentences before execution can take place.

The crime has been compared to a 1994 case that saw a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing allegedly poisoned with thallium, a toxic chemical used in rodent and insect poisons, by classmate Sun Wei while the two were studying chemistry.

The victim, Zhu Ling, survived the poisoning but sustained severe brain damage. CNN reported that, at almost 40 years old, Zhu remains mostly bed-ridden, practically blind and with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old child. He was previously a keen swimmer and skilled musician.

Despite being suspected of the poisoning, Sun was never tried and now lives abroad.
