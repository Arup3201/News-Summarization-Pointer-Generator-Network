Incredible new photographs have revealed the dramatic gun battle which broke out between police and the suspected Boston bombers in a residential street, leaving one brother dead.

The images, taken by a resident of the Watertown street in the early hours of Friday, show the Tsarnaev brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and clearly taking aim at police officers.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother Tamerlan, 26, are seen running to a car for more supplies before hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the street with smoke.

The photographs, taken on the eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the harrowing scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that left one brother dead.

They come as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck in hospital, told investigators that his older brother was the ringleader in the attacks.

Andrew Kitzenberg, who snapped the photographs as he sought refuge in his home, shared the dramatic images and details on his blog.

'I was in my living room working on my computer when I heard multiple "pops" coming from outside,' he recalled. 'At that point, I had no idea that I was about to become an eye witness to the biggest news story in the country.

'When I looked outside my window, I could clearly see two people (the Tsarnaev brothers) taking cover behind an SUV and engaging in gunfire.'

He ran to the third floor of the home to seek shelter from the gunfire.

'As I ran into my room, overwhelmed by shock, adrenaline, and curiosity, I jumped onto my bed to stay below the windows but also have a clear view at the shooters and photograph the event,' he said.

Escape: After detonating the bomb and filling the street with smoke, the youngest brother jumped in the car and ploughed towards the police officers lining the end of the residential street

Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening 

He described seeing the men jump out of a green sedan, which they returned to for supplies - 'assumingly, more ammunition and explosives'.

In another picture, he highlights a dark object that he identifies as a pressure cooker bomb.

'The use of this explosive created an enormous cloud of smoke that covered the entire street,' he wrote. 'While the street was still cloudy with smoke one of the brothers started running down the street towards the officers, while still engaging them in gunshots.

'As he got closer to the officers, within 10 -15 yards of them he was taken down.'

Kitzenberg added he had been unable to see whether police knocked him to the ground or shot him.

Aftermath: When the gun battle was over, police rushed to where the green sedan was parked and announced there were other devices on the street, sparking a search

His brother then jumped in their car and barreled towards the police cars barricading the end of the street. Authorities said he ran over his brother, who was later pronounced dead.

The images reveal the moment Dzhokhar headed for the police cars - dodging between two.

'The SUV side swiped both cars taking out doors and windows and ultimately broke through the vehicle barricade and continued driving west on Laurel St.,' Kitzenberg wrote on his blog. 'This was the last I saw of the black SUV.'

The battle took place after the FBI released the brothers' photographs on Thursday - four days after they allegedly detonated two bombs at the Boston marathon, killing three and injuring 180.

Hunt: Police swarm the street to check all the houses. The witness' home was then evacuated

The Tsarnaevs then allegedly shot dead a police officer outside MIT and hijacked an SUV, telling the driver they had New York in their sights. The car and suspects were then traced to Watertown.

After the gun battle, Dzhokhar fled the scene and hid in a boat which was parked behind a home, but he was scuppered in his escape when the homeowner spotted him and alerted authorities.

A startling homemade video was released showing the terrifying moments residents were forced from their homes at gunpoint as SWAT teams performed door-to-door searches as they searched for him.

While millions of Bostonians waited in their houses on Friday during the city-wide lockdown, the people of Watertown were faced with SWAT officers yelling at them to get out of the buildings.

The video, shot by an unidentified 
Watertown resident, shows a team of SWAT officers wielding 
semi-automatic guns bang on his neighbor's front door and scream for 
them to get out of the house.

The
 residents are whisked away - hands in the air, one by one - to a nearby
 group of officers as the SWAT team searches the house for the second 
shooter, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Resident
 Lauren Kelleher said she saw State Police with massive automatic 
weapons in her backyard, walking past her children's swing set and a 
plastic silver castle.

'The troopers went through. They looked in our yard, they looked in our garage,' she said.

'It was crazy,' said her husband, Tim Kelleher. 'We had SWAT teams, ATF on our lawn.'

Watertown police chief Edward Deveau 
said a resident was checking his boat after the lockdown was lifted 
Friday evening and noticed the straps weren't the way he left them.

He looked in the boat, saw blood and 
someone huddled in a corner and quickly called police. The discovery set
 up the final confrontation and capture with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Officials
 used Dumitru Ciuc's home as a staging area, taking out the windows and 
ripping down curtains and window blinds to monitor the boat.

'They didn't say nothing,' about why they were there, he said. 'They just said leave the house and go up the street.'

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,
 who was pictured being taken away on a stretcher, remains in hospital 
as he recovers from an apparently self-inflicted gun wound to the neck.

He told investigators in scrawled 
notes on Monday that his brother orchestrated the attacks because he 
'wanted to defend Islam from attack', but that he and his brother were 
not linked to any Islamic terrorist groups.

According to CNN, Dzhokhar said his 
older brother, Tamerlan, was the ringleader in the attacks that shook 
the nation a week ago, but that the pair were working alone.

On Monday, he was arraigned in his hospital bed.

He is charged with one count of using
 and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction - namely, an 
improvised explosive device or IED - against persons and property within
 the United States resulting in death, and one count of malicious 
destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in 
death.

If he is convicted, he faces the death penalty or life imprisonment. He also faces a fine of up to $250,000.
