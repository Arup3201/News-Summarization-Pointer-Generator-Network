Civil servants will be given vouchers if they come up with ways to save taxpayers’ cash.

Whitehall workers will be given shopping vouchers for thinking up ‘innovative, thrifty’ ideas to cut costs.

The move will be used by Eric Pickles for staff in his Department for Communities and Local Government.

Mr Pickles said: ‘I want to hear from the bright sparks in the Department who, in the years of spend, spend spend, may have felt that their ideas to save, save, save fell on deaf ears.

‘I want to tap into their expertise and insight , shaving pounds off the balance sheet and saving taxpayers’ money. I want to change the culture of the Civil Service: rewarding people for taxing, regulating and interfering less in other people’s lives.’ 

Mr Pickles was recently praised by the Chancellor George Osborne for running a department that was the ‘model of lean government’.

In recent years, he has clamped down on the use of corporate credit cards and slashed spending on civil servants’ bonuses.

He agreed to cut 10 per cent off his budget by 2015/16 in the latest spending round.

Mr Pickles has also scrapped 12 quangos and already cut his department by 60 per cent.

But just two days after being praised for its ‘lean’ model, Mr Pickles’ department was fined by £20,000 by the Treasury for going £217 overdrawn.

Departmental sources said the vouchers would be for ‘small’ amounts but would not give a precise figure.
