A popular YouTube beauty guru has come under fire from her viewers after she revealed that she uses her nursing friend's breast milk as a homeopathic remedy for combating eye infections

Jackie Aina, who runs the YouTube channel Makeup Game On Point, shared her bizarre trick for treating eye infections, including pink eye, in a recent video about her favorite beauty hacks - but not all of her 400,000 followers approved of her suggestion that people should put someone else's bodily fluid in their eyes. 

'That hack can actually be very dangerous,' one of the video's 450 commenters wrote. 'Breast milk is a bodily fluid that can transmit many infections/diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, CMV, some Herpes viruses and more.' 

Strange cure: Beauty vlogger Jackie Aina from Makeup Game On Point revealed that she used her friend's breast milk to treat a recent eye infection 

Beauty hack: Jackie can be seen demonstrating how she used a cotton swab to put three or four drops of breast milk in her eye per day until the infection was gone

The critic continued: 'Regardless of how close a friendship between you and a friend, you can never be fully aware of all the details of their medical history, so I would strongly advise against it.'

In response, Jackie noted that she never suggested people should take breast milk from strangers. 

'This was not at all some random chick I went to high school with,' she explained. 'The precautions are something everyone should take heed to but I definitely know better.'

She continued: 'I care about my subscribers way too much to just put irresponsible information out there like that, however, if someone does not utilize good judgment on things like this it is not at the responsibility of the YouTuber.' 

But her explanation failed to convince her critics, with a second person adding: 'There has GOT TO be another option than breast milk... like come on.'

'Ummm of course there is another option than breast milk,' Jackie replied. 'But it works and is efficient.'

And while her beauty trick may not have gone down well with all of her viewers, some of Jackie's fans were happy to defend her and her advice. 

Odd request: Jackie said she asked she asked her nursing friend for a small amount of her breast milk after she researched natural remedies on the internet 

'Come on people. Just stop with the "breast milk is a bodily fluid". I'm pretty sure most of us know that. These are just some tips that [Jackie] was trying to share with us from her experience,' one woman wrote.

She added: 'You don't HAVE to do any of them. If you don't agree, then don't try any of them. Simple.' 

In the video, Jackie noted that it was an 'odd' form of treatment that she discovered when she found herself in a desperate situation.   

'I am just a huge believer,' she said. 'The body is supposed to heal itself in some ways - in a lot of ways actually.'

She continued: 'I will always go for a natural method before anything [else] when it comes to stuff like that.'

Jackie came across the remedy when she started to develop an eye infection just days before she was supposed to travel. 

Many uses: A mother can be seen breast feeding her baby. In addition to supposedly treating eye ear infections, it has been claimed that breast milk is a natural solution for skin conditions such as acne 

'Not to sound vain, but the way that I look is everything,' she explained. 'I need to be on point 24/7. For something like an eye infection, that could put me out of commission.'

She admitted that because she didn't have didn't have time to find a doctor to treat her, she began searching the internet for natural remedies to clear up her eye swelling.

Breast milk can supposedly treat eye and ear infections when applied to the infected area with a dropper

People also use it as a contact lens solution because of its anti-bacterial properties 

Gargling with breast milk can allegedly cure a sore throat

It has been used as a body ointment for the treatment of burning, itching and stinging of skin

Breast milk can be used as a facial cleanser with claims that is a natural solution for acne and other skin disorders such as eczema 

It has been used as a substitute for cow's milk in coffee and cereal

And according to Jackie, breast milk was the first solution to come up. She soon called her nursing friend and asked for some of her breast milk.

'Yo this is awkward. I need some pumps, I need some calcium girl. Hook it up,' she said of her conversation with the new mother.  

After her friend gave her a small amount of breast milk, Jackie used a clean cotton swab to apply it to her eye area three or four times daily.  

'The next day the swelling that started was starting to appear in my eye went away completely,' she said. 

'It never came back honey,' she added. 'Get you some breast milk.'  

Breast milk has also become the latest trend in skincare. 

Mud Facial Bar in Chicago is planning to offer clients breast milk facials with the claim that it can help sooth conditions such as acne and eczema because of its anti-bacterial properties.

'Human breast milk has a lot of antibodies in it that helps fight infection, and since acne is an infection of the skin, that is one that it helps fight,' Spa owner Shama Patel told Daily Mail Australia.

'Additionally, it helps with sun burn, eczema, wrinkles and making the skin's overall appearance smoother.'
