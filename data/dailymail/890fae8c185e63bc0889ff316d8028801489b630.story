Ambassador Chris Stevens was still breathing as Libyans pulled him from a room where he was found after last week's attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, according to an eyewitness.

A video shot after the assault on the consulate shows people scrambling to save Stevens after he was discovered in a room of the building.

Fahd al-Bakoush said he was there when a crowd pulled Stevens out of the room inside the consulate where someone stumbled across him, thinking he was dead.

No one knew who he was.

Desperate: Stevens' legs can be seen emerging from the doorway as Libyans are apparently trying to help him

Al-Bakoush told the Associated Press on Monday that Stevens was breathing, though his face was blackened and he seemed paralyzed.

A translation provided by The New York Times shows that one of the Libyans said: 'I swear, he's dead.'

Another man says: 'Bring him out, man! Bring him out,' another says.

There is hope as others are heard saying: 'The man is alive. Move out of the way. Just bring him out, man.

'Move, move, he is still alive!'

Struggle: A crowd that had developed around the entrance to the room shouted with joy after Stevens' was found to still be alive, but he later died at a hospital

The crowd that had formed in the area then shouts: 'Alive, Alive! God is great.'

Al-Bakoush said the crowd carried Stevens to a private car to drive him to a hospital, since there was no ambulance.

Three other Americans died in the Tuesday attack, part of a wave of unrest over an anti-Islam film, Innocence of Muslims.

In an original English version and another dubbed into Egyptian Arabic, Mohammed is branded a child molester, a fraud and a madman, and he's shown him having sex and calling for massacres.

Arguing for action: Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah pushed for the creation of an international law that would ban insults of Islam in wake of the offensive film that prompted global protests

Meanwhile, the leader of the 
Hezbollah militant group called for protests against the film and said 
the U.S. must be held accountable for it, a move that may escalate tensions in the Arab world.

In
a televised speech, Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah pushed for 
the creation of an international law that would ban insults of Islam and
other religions, citing similar laws that exist to prevent 
anti-Semitism.

'Those who should be held accountable, punished, prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them, primarily the United States of America,' Mr Nasrallah said.

He called for protests on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too.

'We should not only express our anger at an American embassy here or there. We should tell our rulers in the Arab and Muslim world that it is "your responsibility in the first place" and since you officially represent the governments and states of the Muslim world you should impose on the United States, Europe and the whole world that our prophet, our Koran and our holy places and honor of our Prophet be respected,' he said.

Emotions run high: Thousands of protesters shout
slogans during a march in Lahore, Pakistan, against an anti-Islam film, Innocence of Muslims, which was made in the U.S.

A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site.

The violence began Tuesday when mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in the courtyard.

President Obama has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice but also stressed that the U.S. respects religious freedom.
