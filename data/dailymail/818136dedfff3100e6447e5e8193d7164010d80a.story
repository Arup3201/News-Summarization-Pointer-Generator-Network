A doctor is accused of raping a former lover he had a secret affair with in Pakistan and threatening to release naked photographs of her when she rejected his advances.

Dr Muhammed Khan, who practices in Glasgow, is fighting for his career at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing (MTPS).

His alleged victim, who can only be identified as 'Miss A', has accused Khan of raping her when she was a student in Pakistan when she was 17 in 2001.

Defence: Dr Muhammed Khan, pictured, is fighting for his career at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal 
Service hearing. Miss A claims Khan threatened to disgrace her by showing photographs of her nude

She told the medical watchdog panel in Manchester that over a nine-year period Khan forced her to have sex and pose for explicit photographs.

The woman, who also works in the medical profession, finally made the complaint to the MPTS in 2009 after claiming Khan arrived at her workplace with the explicit photographs.

Miss A claims Khan threatened to disgrace her by showing the photographs of her nude and performing a sex act to her father in Pakistan and friends.

It is against Islamic law for women to have boyfriends and a sexual relationship is taboo in Pakistan and with devout Muslim families who have strict rules on marriage.

Despite this Miss A admitted to the panel that she and Khan did have a sexual relationship which continued even after she was allegedly 'brutally raped' in 2001.

Under cross-examination Miss A claimed she continued with a relationship with Khan because she 'was convinced that what he did was out of love'.

The incident is thought to have happened at the Khyber Medical College in Pakistan when Khan is said to have 'lured' Miss A with a promise to hand over some photos.

Defence counsel Mr Anthony Hayworth refused to accept she had been raped and they instead confirmed their love for each other by swearing on the Quran.

Allegations: The victim, who has not been named, told the medical watchdog panel in 
Manchester (pictured) that over a nine-year period until 2009 Khan forced her to 
have sex and pose for explicit photographs

He said: 'You regarded each other as husband and wife, didn’t you?'

Miss A denied that but admitted that their relationship continued for a further seven years afterward, during which the two regularly exchanged telephone calls and text messages.

The panel were told that gifts, birthday cards and messages with elaborate 'I love you' sentiments were swapped between them.

But the relationship soured when Miss A, who was dating and has since married another man, refused to rekindle their relationship once Khan arrived in the UK in 2008.

It is claimed that Khan then embarked on a campaign of blackmail because he was demanding that Miss A should have his hand in marriage.

The MPTS is to ascertain whether he has acted improperly as a GP which carried a most severe penalty of being struck off.

Defence counsel Mr Anthony Hayworth claimed Miss A’s accusations were a 'fantasy' and she was trying to get 'revenge' for going against her faith.

Mr Hayworth also accused her of lying for failing to admit that she and Dr Khan had sex 'over a dozen times' to the panel.

She said: 'I have not been lying. This is a story over ten or 11 years. It’s been very difficult.'

Mr Hayworth claimed that no photos of Khan exist and she never received any because she has not been able to produce them as evidence.

She said: 'I was told to delete them which I did because it was very dangerous for me to have them on my home computer.'

Khan is further accused of telephoning a friend of Miss A and saying he had discussed kidnapping him in Pakistan but denies all the charges against him.

The medical professional qualified at the University of Peshawar in 2004 but is not registered as a GP or a specialist in the UK.

He is 'registered with a licence to practise', according to the General Medical Council.

No criminal charges have been brought.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
