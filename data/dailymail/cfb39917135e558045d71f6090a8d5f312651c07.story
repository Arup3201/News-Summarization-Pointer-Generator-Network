Jose Mourinho thinks it is unfair to single out David Luiz after the former Chelsea defender made a number of mistakes during Brazil's humiliating 7-1 defeat by Germany.

In the absence of suspended captain Thiago Silva, Brazil's back four was ripped apart by Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte.

And Luiz, who started alongside Dante in the centre of defence and skippered his side, endured a torrid evening as Joachim Low's side tore through the hosts at will.

But Mourinho, speaking in his capacity as Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador, thinks the whole Brazil team are to blame, not just Luiz.

The Chelsea manager said: 'I don't think it's fair to separate a player from the team, because the team was really bad.

'David made mistakes? Yes he did. But, Dante made mistake, Marcelo made mistakes, Fernandinho made mistakes. The team as a team made mistakes. So I don't think it’s fair.

'I think everyone in my situation, everyone that is a player, everyone that is a coach, everyone that is not involved in the World Cup, but could be in that position.'

Luiz was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £50million this summer, but he was part of the most devastating defeat in Brazil's World Cup history in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday.

Mourinho said: 'I think all of us are feeling really sorry for them. Because it is a historic moment.

'A moment that we will remember forever the same way that we all know that once many, many, many years ago, once Brazil lost a World Cup final against Uruguay in America and the same way my son, who is 14 years old, knows that.

'In 50 years’ time our kids will know that Brazil lost at home against Germany, one to seven.

'From my point of view, from the professional point of view, it's heartbreaking and I'm really sorry for them.'
