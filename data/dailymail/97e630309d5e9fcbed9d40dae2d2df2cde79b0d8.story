The BBC is sending 272 staff to the World Cup in Brazil this summer - enough to field almost 25 football teams.

Licence-fee payers will spend £12million funding the trip to cover the month-long tournament in South America starting on June 12.

The bill will include five-star treatment for pundits Gary Lineker, 50, Alan Shearer, 43, Alan Hansen, 58, and Robbie Savage, 39.

Corporation bosses have justified the spending by saying they plan to make Brazil 2014 the first '24/7' World Cup and say it will cost viewers and listeners 'less than a pint of milk' each.

There will be 12 separate commentary teams covering more than 50 matches for TV and more than 60 for radio as well as shows including a documentary about David Beckham travelling to the Amazon rainforest.

BBC and ITV split World Cup coverage down the middle yet the licence-fee funded Corporation are sending more than double the number of personnel to Brazil than their commercial rivals.

Bosses claim their bloated presence of 272 at the tournament is less than the excessive 295 they sent to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup but will be delivering up to 50 per cent more TV output.

Yet the BBC army compares with ITV making do with a 120-strong task force in South America, with most of those freelance operators.

BBC director of sport Barbara Slater tried to justify the cost to taxpayers in a lengthy website blog claiming: ‘Our aspiration is to make Brazil 2014 the first 24/7 World Cup, which will appeal to all age groups, is available across all devices at any time of the day or night. We will be producing all this for less than the cost of a pint of milk for each viewer, listener or website user.’

Ms Slater added: ‘Throughout the planning process, all parts of the BBC have been acutely aware of striking a balance between editorial ambition and value for money'.

But critics have accused the BBC of sending staff on a 'wasteful jolly'.

Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said:‘Auntie continues to send an army of staff to cover big sporting events while other broadcasters manage to with far fewer.

‘The BBC needs to stop wasting so much of the licence fee on this extravaganza and cut back on the number of additional jollies that come with the coverage.

‘Viewers want to watch the World Cup, but they shouldn’t have to pay for so many extra staff to cover the games.’

It came in the week where fans accused the Football Association of ripping them off over the £90 price of England's new shirt for the World Cup.

Fans are unhappy that the new, costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale.

Problem: Supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing England's World Cup strips - with the new Brazil shirt costing £90

It was only last May that the previous home kit was released, which has been worn just seven times.

The red away kit, released even more recently in June 2013, has had just two airings.

The
 £90 shirt is identical to those worn by Roy Hodgson's side, while an 
adult 'stadium' England shirt is priced at £60 and shirts for children 
aged between eight and 15 cost £42, with mini-kits priced at £40.

David Cameron has led calls for a 'rethink' and insisted the charges are 'not right' and risk punishing 
loyal supporters who are 'the bedrock of our national game'.
