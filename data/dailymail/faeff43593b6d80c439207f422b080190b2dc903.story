Do you match your top to your tipple? If so, you aren't alone as a new survey has found that more than half of British people 'drinkcessorise' or match their drink to their style.

The study also found that some drinks are considered more stylish than others, with cocktails, wine and cider topping the cool chart while lager and beer languish at the bottom.

What's more, revealed the survey, your choice of tipple can even have an impact on how attractive you are to the opposite sex, with the majority of respondents saying that your favourite drink speaks volumes about your personality.

Looking good: The research found that more than half of British people match their tipple to their style

Londoners were the most likely to judge attractiveness based on tipple tastes, with over half (52 per cent) of those in the capital saying that drink choice helps to make someone appear more attractive.

Stylist, Alexxia Elizabeth commented: 'Of course people match their drinks with their style, it’s one of those unspoken rules of the pub.

Cocktails such as the Cosmopolitan are perceived as being a cooler drink than beer and lager

'If you’re in a summery beer garden you might go for a floral print with biker boots to add some edge and in that case a blush pink drink can not only complement your outfit colour-wise, but it can also help you carry off the overall mood and style you’re going for.

'Choosing a clashing drink, or something that just isn’t sexy, can ruin a whole look.'

Surprisingly, the study, which was carried out by Koppaberg cider, also found that men are slightly more likely to 'drincessorise' than women.

More than half of men admit to matching their drink to their look, compared with just 47 per cent of women.

A spokesperson for the brand said: 'I think the major influence on what people drink is whether they like it or not, but it’s interesting to see just how important it is to match your style of drink with your overall style.

'Since we launched Kopparberg in the UK, the brand has carried on the Swedish tradition for great design, as has our glassware, which is perhaps why we are seeing a lot of people characterising it as stylish and matching it with their look.'

Coco Face: Coconut water doesn't always have to be healthy

APEROL SPRITZ: A little bit bitter, a little bit sweet, and a little bit spritzy. 
It's like an Italian summer in a glass, and it's lower alcohol than most
spirits, so go on, get a second round! Head to any decent Italian or 
make them at home ...

COCONUT WATER COCKTAILS: We're all up-to-speed on the healthy-ness of coconut water by now (if not - where have you been?), did you know it also makes a mean cocktail mixer? Skip the pre-bottled stuff though and buy the real thing from the guys at CocoFace www.cocoface.co.uk (they even do home delivery) and pour in 50mls of vodka (we choose Belvedere) and voila, mind = blown. As seen at some of this summer’s hottest festivals.

BEER COCKTAILS: Yeah, you heard us right! Peroni are doing it, London’s hottest restaurant Dabbous is doing it. Now you can do it at home by shaking and straining the ingredients below and topping with your favourite beer ...

Sunshine Marys: Your new breakfast drink?

SUNSHINE MARYS: Forget Bloody Marys now it's all about the Sunshine Marys. Made with Yellow Tomato Juice from the Isle of Wight, spices and Kamm & Sons Ginseng Spirit. The yellow tomato juice is slightly sweeter, so you can add more spice, and Kamm & Sons is made with loads of awesome botanicals, like manuka honey and echincea,  your poor alcohol soaked livers might even thank you! Try one at The Beagle in London, or just make it yourself ...
