A lottery winner from Minnesota hit the $11.7 million jackpot but that isn't stopping him from keeping his job as a snow plowman.

Joe Meath told Fox that he's been retired for years and snow plowing is something he does to help his neighbors and contribute to his community in East Bethel.

Meath drives a Chevy pickup with 300,000 miles on it and promised to clear the snow before he won the lotto two months ago and he's standing by his word.

Lucky pair: Joe and Rhonda Meath appear at a press conference after winning the $11.7 million Hot Lotto jackpot back in September

'I don’t know what I’d be doing if I wasn’t doing this today,' Meath told Fox. 

'It’s been fun doing what we’ve done with the money. We bought another house, we bought a motor home, but other than that, it’s been difficult with trying to figure out what to do with the money.'

Meath won $11.7 million in September after he luckily matched a Hot Lotto ticket at a local Shell gas station.

'It took a while for it to sink in,' Meath told the Star Tribune after his big win.

'We’re just ordinary people,' said Rhonda Meath, his wife of 32 years.

Meath said he's been getting letters from people asking him for money but that he's not too quick top spend the sum. 

'I had one person send me an arrest record because he needs $75,000 for bail because he was wrongfully arrested,' he said.

'We think about making sure there's enough for our kids and our grandkids down the line,' he added.

They said they want to hold on to the money they have won for their future and are aware of the problems too much money can cause.

'It's sort of scary now because you have to realize you have to keep a hold of the money you have won for your future,' he said.
