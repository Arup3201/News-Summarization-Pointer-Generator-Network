Claudia Fragapane might only be 16 years old, 4ft 6in tall and weigh less than six-and-a-half stone but she produced an almighty comeback to top an all-England medal podium.

Fragapane’s team-mates Ruby Harrold and Hannah Whelan, who she had just knocked into the minor medal positions, held her aloft and Glasgow’s SSE Hydro arena erupted into an ear splitting roar as she was announced the winner.

Fragapane, whose career highlight before this week was making four finals at the English Schools Championships, thought she had blown her medal chances falling off the beam. But her tiny legs propelled her to 14.733 points for her floor routine and a total of 56.132, enough to nick gold on a stunning day for English gymnastics.

Whitlock earlier won gold in the men's all-around final ahead of Scotland's Dan Keatings and England team-mate Nile Wilson who claimed bronze.

The women's competition was split into two subdivisions and Scotland's Emma White led after the first with a total of 51.532 from the four pieces of apparatus - the floor, beam, vault and bars.

England's Harrold achieved the best score on vault with a 14.800 tally to start her medal bid in the second half of the competition in the best possible way, closely followed by top all-around qualifier Fragapane, who went on to continue her good form on the bars with a score of 13.700.

Whelan, having performed a good vault, stumbled on landing from bars to lose ground on her two team-mates, with Harrold scoring 14.566 to hold top spot at the halfway stage, with Fragapane second, Canada's Elsabeth Black in bronze and Wales' Elizabeth Beddoe in fourth place.

Fragapane came off the beam to slightly dent her medal bid, scoring 12.966, but Whelan impressed and achieved 14.033, with Harrold also scoring in the 12-point zone to marginally sit ahead of Fragapane and Black ahead of the final rotation.

The last piece for the English trio was the floor and Whelan finished off with a solid routine which put  before Harrold moved into gold medal position with a performance that scored 13.700.

Black scored 12.766 meaning with Fragapane left to compete, England could claim all three places on the podium, and the diminutive gymnast stepped up and hit her routine to a huge ovation from the crowd as she won gold with a score of 14.733.

Making a name for herself: Fragapane, who weighs just six-and-a-half stone, is only 4ft 6in
