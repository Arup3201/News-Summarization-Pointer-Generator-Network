One of the Government’s first flagship free schools was axed yesterday after inspectors condemned its poor teaching standards.

The Discovery New School in Crawley, West Sussex, was among the first free schools to open under the Coalition in 2011.

However, it will now be the first to be closed down after the Department for Education decided to terminate its funding, and  parents of the 65 pupils will be forced to find places elsewhere from April.

Free schools are state-funded but free of local authority control, and can be set up by parents, groups of teachers and charitable trusts. Some 174 have opened, including 93 this year alone.

Closure: The Discovery New School on Crawley, West Sussex is to shut after inspectors found none of the teachers provided good quality lessons

Flagship: The school was one of the first of 24 to open in 2011

Discovery New School – which has received millions of pounds of state funding – was declared failing and placed in special measures by Ofsted in May. It was re-inspected in November when it was warned that not enough progress was being made.

Yesterday, Schools Minister Lord Nash wrote to Discovery’s chairman of governors, Chris Cook, warning him that the Department for Education was terminating its funding agreement.

In his letter to Mr Cook, Lord Nash said he had expressed ‘grave concerns’ about the primary school’s education standards.

He added: ‘None of the school’s teachers were delivering good lessons and all were still consistently inadequate or required improvement.’

The letter said it was also unclear whether the trust running the school, which was supposed to be part of the Montessori movement, had identified what was needed to make improvements.

It said: ‘The staff are currently unable to deliver teaching and learning even at the most basic level, with the consequence for the pupils of continued inadequate teaching for an unacceptable length of time.’

Blow: The closure of the Discovery Free School is a significant setback for Education Secretary Michael Gove's flagship reforms

The closure is hugely damaging for Education Secretary Michael Gove’s free schools programme and comes after a damning Ofsted report into the country’s first  Muslim free school, Al-Madinah in Derby.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘Since [Discovery New School] was placed in special measures in May we have monitored progress closely. The trust has not provided evidence they are making the changes required. Lord Nash has today notified the trust that the department will terminate its funding agreement at the end of the spring term.

Plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years were thrown out yesterday.

Tory councillors in Kent hoped to use newly relaxed Coalition rules on school expansions to create an ‘annexe’ to an existing grammar in Sevenoaks that could take up to 1,300 pupils.

But the Department for Education dismissed the plan, saying it was the ‘establishment of a new selective school’ rather than an expansion, which is not allowed by law.

Campaigners reacted angrily,  claiming that the law needs to be changed to give parents choice over their children’s education.

‘We are now working with West Sussex County Council to ensure the children have suitable alternatives in place and their transition is as smooth as possible.’

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘When a school closes it is the children who suffer and their education that is affected. There will be many worried parents in the run-up to Christmas concerned about what this means for their child’s education.

‘The blame for the closure of this school lies squarely with Michael Gove and his free school programme, which has failed to ensure schools opened under the policy can provide a decent standard of education.’

Philip Bujak, chief executive of the  Montessori St Nicholas Charity, said: ‘We advised the DfE to allow us to oversee the implementation of the Montessori element and curriculum.

‘That advice was ignored and the result is the waste of a large amount of money, the name of Montessori tarnished and a large number of parents very badly let down.’
