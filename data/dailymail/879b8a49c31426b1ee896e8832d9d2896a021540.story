Ricardo Carvalho has warned Premier League defenders that Monaco team-mate Radamel Falcao is on the verge of realising his frightening goalscoring potential on loan at Manchester United.

The striker, who completed a £6million season-long loan move in the summer ahead of a £43.5m permanent deal, is yet to find the net in his first three United games.

But with Wayne Rooney banned for three matches, there is increased pressure on the Colombian to open his account for the club.

Falcao arrived in England with a fearsome goal-scoring reputation, but has so far drawn a blank.

But Monaco defender Carvalho warned: 'He doesn't need too much time. He's a striker that smells the goal and is dangerous in the box. Always when he gets the opportunity to score, he will score.

'The Premier League is a tough league to play in, but I think he'll do well and score there.

'He has that thing with him when he gets a half chance he will score. He's a great striker and a great professional.'

According to Carvalho, Falcao was intent on leaving Monaco when he started to hear of interest from Real Madrid and Manchester United in the summer.

Falcao knows the Spanish La Liga well due to his his two years at Atletico Madrid, so began asking Carvalho about the Premier League.

Carvalho spent six years playing in the top flight at Chelsea – where he won three titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups – and is well-versed in what it takes to succeed in England.

Being a centre-back, he is also aware of what forwards require to cope with and flourish in a league known for its brutal and unforgiving nature.

'For him it would've been easier to go back to Spain,' Carvalho added. 'But he wants to try the Premier League. It is physical and strong and there is more pace.

'When he heard Manchester United were interested he wanted to try it. He was speaking with us about the Premier League. He knows the Spanish league also, but he was asking about the Premier League.

'For me the Premier League is the best. Real Madrid is a big club and Barcelona too, but I enjoy the games more in England than when I was in Spain. Also the way Falcao plays, I said that for me it's the best for him.'
