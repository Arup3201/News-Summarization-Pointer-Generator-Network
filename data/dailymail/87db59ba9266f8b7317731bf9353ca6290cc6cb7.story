Prince Harry enjoyed a night at the arrows when he headed to the home of the darts for an evening of fun.

The royal is often seen at rugby and polo matches and recently hosted a Christmas Eve football match for staff at Sandringham.

But he enjoyed a more laid back spectator sport last night when he was seen at the William Hill PDC World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace in north London.

Bunting - known as 'The Bullet' - later joked: 'I didn't know Harry was here. I'm going to have a pint with him now! But it is great that darts is getting this type of coverage.'

The prince also got to see defending champion, Dutchman Michael 'Mighty Mike' van Gerwen, beat Terry 'The Bull' Jenkins.

The royal was not the only famous face at the event; TV presenter Clare Balding and football referee Howard Webb were also spotted among the crowd.  

It's not the first time the prince has been seen at the darts. He first headed to watch the sport four years ago

The darts championship has attracted a number of famous visitors this week, including TV presenter Clare Balding and England footballer Andros Townsend

Harry was first seen at the darts nearly four years ago when royal protocol was breached by victorious semi-finalist Adrian Lewis, who inadvertently kissed the fifth in line to the throne.

But the boisterous atmosphere didn't put off the Prince and he was headed back to the north London venue while on a break from military duties in January.

The royal's appearance again last night went down well with darts fans, who hailed him as 'a lad' and 'a legend'.

A Twitter user called Rock Geek Girl tweeted: 'The fact that Prince Harry is at the darts gives me a tiny bit of faith in the future of the Royal family.'

And website user Mikey Smith added: 'Prince Harry at the darts, just make the man king.'
