Members of the Jedi church believe in the Force, rather than the Holy Ghost. It's a religion barely two decades old and based off a movie franchise, but there's still a lot the Jedi have in common with other religious groups. 

Details' Benjamin Svetkey recently attended a gathering of Jedi in Norris, Texas where he witnessed the 'knighting' of padawon learner Ally Thompson, 28, an Iraqi-war veteran from Tennessee. 

From the get go, Ms Thompson explains that her religion doesn't seek to turn fictional characters like Yoda or Obi-Wan Kenobi into idols.

Father, son and the holy Force: Jediism is a growing religion around the world. The church began to form in the late 1990s, and is based off the league of knights from the Star Wars movie franchise

'No we don't worship Yoda. And telekinesis is not something that we necessarily do - at least not like in the movies,' she explains. But I won't deny that the Force is very present in our teachings. Some people call it magic. Some call it Ashe. The scientific community calls it energy. But it's everywhere. You can find it in the Bible. When Moses parted the Red Sea - how did he do that? With energy. With the Force.'

While the group in Texas only included fifteen men and three women, The Jedi church has been growing around the world. In England it's the seventh-largest religion with 175,000 members. There are 15,000 Jedi in the Czech republic, 9,000 in Canada and 65,000 in Australia.

While many of these so-called members list the Jedi church as a joke, John Henry Phelan, who runs TempleOfTheJediOrder.org (the most trafficked Jedi church website online), estimates that there are about 5,000 real Jedi in the U.S.

'I'm talking serious, committed Jedi - not people who sign up on a website because they're curious or bored,' Mr Phelan says.

One of Jediism's prominent members, Kevin Trout (known as Opie MacLeod in the community), explains how the late 90s created the perfect storm upon which to start the religion.

'With Jediism you needed a way for people to connect,' Mr Trout says, meaning the internet. 'And you needed something to reignite the imagination, which was the re-release of the first three Star Wars movies in 1997, then the release of Episode I in 1999.'

While it may sound like a crazy concept, Jediism already shares a lot with mainstream religions.

Like the Mormans were driven from the Midwest in their church's early years, so the Jedi are facing their own type of persecution.

Trout explains that he usually keeps his Jedi beliefs hidden from women in the early stages of a relationship.

'Yeah, there's a stigma to being a Jedi. But most Jedi prefer that to the baggage other religions carry around from history. You know, like the Crusades.'

And who needs women when you can move objects with your mind? 

COURTESY TEMPLE OF THE JEDI ORDER

'There have been times when I've found myself on the freeway behind some horrible driver and I'll do the Jedi hand trick: "Take the next exit, that is the exit you're looking for..."' Trout said.

Jedi mind tricks aside, the group's real center revolves around an ethical system just like any other religion. Basically it all stems from a Jedi code laid out in a Star Wars role-playing guide from 1987, which states:

'There is no emotion, there is peaceThere is no ignorance, there is knowledgeThere is no passion, there is serenityThere is no death, there is the force.'

Anthropologist Matthew Kappel who wrote 'Finding the Force of the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and the Critics' explains that it was the participatory nature of the book that helped start the religion, and the code's content that gave it a purpose.

'The Code is in the glossary in the back in the "stuff you need to know" section. But what's important about the book from an anthropological point of view, is that it's participatory. It's the first Star Wars role-playing game. Before the book, you could only see the movies. Afterward you could participate in its fictional world. And you can't have a religion without participation,' Kappel said.

For members of Jediism, the point of religion is not to secure some spot in the afterlife, but to do right for humankind on earth which translates to a lot of community service time.

'With Jediism...our religious observance is found through service ot the community,' said 30-year-old Jedi Knight Andy Spaulding, who is also a member of the Kentucky National Guardsmen. 'Service is sort of what we do for prayer.'
