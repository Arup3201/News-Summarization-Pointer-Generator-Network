Accused: Frank Saucier allegedly enticed children into his postal truck to 'play house'

A postman has been accused of sexually assaulting children in his delivery truck after enticing them into his vehicle to ‘play house’.

Former US Postal Service (USPS) worker Frank Saucier, 44, was arrested on April 26 in Manchester, New Hampshire after children told their parents he had invited them inside his truck, police said.

The postman allegedly assaulted several children while on his postal route on the west side of Manchester. 

In the games, Mr Saucier would allegedly play the ‘dad’ and sometimes pretend to be driving the parked vehicle according to The Manchester Union-Leader. 

Mr Saucier was originally arrested for allegedly smacking a 10-year-old boy inside his truck and as investigations continued, more charges involving other children, aged seven to ten-years-old, came to light.

Originally charged with assault, police investigators have now accused the man from Tyngsborough, Massachusetts of several charges including six counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, one felony charge of indecent exposure and one charge of sexual assault.

Yet to be convicted: Mr Saucier, who was working in Manchester, New Hampshire when the alleged incidents occurred, is expected to front court again in August

The USPS released a statement in response to the allegations on the day of Mr Saucier’s arrest.

It reads: ‘This isolated incident is not representative of the honesty and integrity of postal employees serving our nation today.  

‘The Postal Inspection Service will continue to enforce the laws that protect and prevent the American people from criminal acts.

‘Even with today’s arrest, the individual charged is entitled to a presumption of innocence until he or she has been convicted in a court of law.’

Mr Saucier fronted Hillsborough County Grand Jury last Friday to hear the charges and an arraignment date expected to be set sometime in August.
