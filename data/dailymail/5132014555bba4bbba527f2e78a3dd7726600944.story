Chelsea are considering a renewed bid to sign Raphael Varane from Real Madrid this summer.

Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer of the France international centre-back and is willing to test Real Madrid's resolve to hold onto the 21-year-old.

Varane is valued at £40million by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and was signed after being persuaded by Zinedine Zidane that Madrid was where his future lay.

However, Varane has grown frustrated this year with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit.

Manchester United are also keeping tabs on Varane after losing out to Real Madrid in 2011.

Age: 21

Appearances: Lens 23/Goals 2;

Real Madrid 76 (20)/5; France 17/1

Varane has been labelled Real Madrid's Lion and former France defender Frank Leboeuf believes he has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro

Varane signed a new six-year contract at the start of the season

Sir Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him from Lens and the Old Trafford club will challenge for his signature again should Madrid show a willingness to deal.

Mourinho has concerns about the centre of his defence. Gary Cahill has sometimes looked uneasy against European opposition while John Terry is 34.

Kurt Zouma has done well this season but is still inexperienced and Varane is already an assured performer at international level.

Chelsea captain Terry will be given a new one year contract while Branislav Ivanovic, who is 31, has 16 months left on contract. 

The Blues also have Andreas Christensen and Tomas Kalas in reserve but both lack big game experience.
