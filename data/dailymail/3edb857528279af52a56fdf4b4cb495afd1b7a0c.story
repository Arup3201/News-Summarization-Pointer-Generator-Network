These incredible pictures show the gripping moments a snowy owl snatches its prey off freezing ground.

The sequence of images follows the bird from being perched on a post to taking flight after spotting a helpless mouse with its piercing yellow eyes.

In one of the shots, the bird flashes an glance to the camera as if to say 'watch this', before swooping on the unsuspecting creature.

A small explosion of powder shoots off the turf as the owl's claws grab the rodent as it swoops down, wings outspread, to grab its dinner.

And seconds after spotting dinner, it soars off into the sky before gobbling down the feast.

Photographer Peter Stahl, who took the images in Alberta, Canada, said he was so focused on capturing the shot he wasn't able to enjoy the incredible moment until afterwards.

'To get the right setting and lighting rarely comes along, so this was a once in a lifetime shot,' he said.

'When I realised I was going to get the image, I was just so focused on the subject thinking "I better get this shot right" because it might not happen again all winter, that I didn't really appreciate how amazing it was until I looked back at my pictures.'

According to National Geographic, the snowy owl has unmistakable white plumage that echoes its Arctic origins. Young owls get whiter as they get older.

Females are darker than males with dusky spotting and never become totally white. They have keen eyesight and good hearing which help them when they are hunting for prey hiding under vegetation or snow.

The magnificent birds sometimes remain year-round in their northern breeding grounds, but are frequent migrants to Canada, the norther United States, Europe and Asia.
