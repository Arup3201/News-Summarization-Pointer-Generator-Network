A devoted boyfriend spent months building his girlfriend a beautiful customized armoire for her jewelry - and then popped the question after hiding an engagement ring inside it. 

Blake Bullinger gave the handmade mahogany drawer set to girlfriend Carly Stene for their second anniversary on October 9, telling her: 'I thought you needed something a little bit better than shoe boxes [to store your jewelry].

'Start at the top [drawer] and work your way down.'

The happy couple: Blake Bullinger (L) popped the question to girlfriend Carly on their second anniversary

'Make me the happiest guy in the world': The bride-to-be was so overcome with emotion that she could only nod her 'yes' to her kneeling fiance

His stunned bride-to-be was overwhelmed with the overly-generous gesture and - surrounded by her family and friends - eagerly began exploring the armoire, exclaiming with joy when she found a variety of her favorite things, including gluten free brownie mix, rice krispie treats and a pumpkin spice candle, secreted away in each of the drawers. 

It was in the very bottom of the elaborately-designed furniture that the real surprise lay in wait however.

After Carly had unearthed a treasure trove of sweet treats, Blake suggested that she take another look in the Twix-filled bottom drawer, saying: 'I don't think you looked in that drawer hard enough.

'You've got to dig around a little bit.'

It didn't take long for Carly to uncover a small wooden box hidden among her favorite chocolate bars, which she opened to reveal a stunning diamond ring. 

Sealed with a kiss: Carly's family and friends were all there to witness the surprise proposal

Ever the gentleman, Blake quickly dropped to one knee and asked the sobbing college senior: 'Will you make me the happiest guy in the world and marry me?'

Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for his speechless girlfriend to nod her consent, before enveloping her fiance in a big hug.

'I just got really emotional because he put so much thought and work into it,' Carly told Today.com. 'He was so considerate in taking into account what I actually needed and might like.'

The heartwarming moment was captured on camera by Carly's mother - and posted to YouTube the day after the proposal, where it has quickly amassed more than 630,000 views. 

'I was so thankful they were videotaping it because I really don’t remember from opening the box until five minutes later,' Carly added. 

'We just put it up because we knew our family would want to see it. If our friends wanted to watch it, that was cool. 

'But we had never thought it would do anything like this.'

'Start at the top...' Carly's future husband told her to open each drawer of the armoire to check what was hidden inside

The couple are both currently in their last year of college - Carly, 22, is spending the year doing clinical lab work at a Kansas City hospital, while 21-year-old Blake is studying at a school about two hours away in Pittsburg, Kansas - and are due to finish up their courses in May. 

And it looks as though Blake will have plenty to occupy his free time after he graduates; the skilled carpenter has already received a number of armoire requests from viewers of the YouTube video eager to get their hands on one of his custom pieces. 

'I am very interested in buying a jewelry chest like that if you make more!' one commented, while another added: 'This is so beautiful and the armoire is amazing. Could you make me one if I pay you?!'
