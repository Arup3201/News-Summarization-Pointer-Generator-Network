War of words: Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said Nick Clegg should be ousted to ensure they don't fail badly in 2015

The Liberal Democrats were plunged 
into turmoil yesterday as Vince Cable’s closest political ally suggested
 Nick Clegg should step down to prevent a rout at the next election.

In a devastating intervention, Lord 
Oakeshott said the party needed to overhaul its policies and leadership 
in the face of dire opinion poll ratings.

Lord Oakeshott, the party’s former 
Treasury spokesman, said: ‘We have lost over half our market share – if 
you like to put it that way, if we had been Sainsbury’s – since the 
election, and any business that had done that would be looking very hard
 now at both its strategy and its management to see how we get some of 
that back because otherwise we are going to lose a large number of seats
 at the next election.’

And in a clear shot at Mr Clegg, he said elections were ‘not just about the message, they are also about the messenger’.

He said many Lib Dems found it 
‘difficult’ to be in a coalition and suggested Mr Clegg had to work 
harder to drive the party’s values home.

He added: ‘We do have... very good 
policies which are popular. But on things like the banks, sorting them 
out, like taxing the wealthy, we have to fight very hard not just to put
 the message across but to get it implemented in government.’

Lord Oakeshott was sacked by Mr Clegg 
after criticising the Government’s failure to tackle bank bonuses.

But 
he remains a close ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable who is 
emerging as the most likely candidate to replace Mr Clegg if he quits or
 is forced out before the next election.

Differences: The Cabinet colleagues have shown a united front in the Commons since the coalition Government was formed, but they disagree over a new tax for the rich

There was no suggestion that Lord 
Oakeshott was acting on behalf of Mr Cable, and senior Lib Dems last 
night dismissed his intervention as ‘one man’s views’.

And last night Mr Clegg said: ‘For as 
long as I have been in politics you always have back seat drivers who 
end up making endless comments about people who actually have to lead 
and make decisions and take responsibility.’

But the intervention was another 
setback for the Deputy Prime Minister whose attempt to relaunch his 
leadership with plans for a wealth tax have already fallen flat.

Criticism: Senior Conservatives John Redwood (left) and Bernard Jenkin (right) have attacked Mr Clegg's proposal

Lord Oakeshott’s comments highlight 
mounting concern within Lib Dem ranks about the impact of the Coalition 
on the party’s poll ratings.

Recent polls have put the party on 
just 10 per cent of the vote – less than the UK Independence Party. If 
this level of support does not improve, the party stands to lose 47 of 
its 57 seats at the next election.

Earlier this summer 69-year-old Vince 
Cable fuelled speculation about his ambitions by refusing to rule out 
succeeding Mr Clegg, saying: ‘I don’t exclude it – who knows what might 
happen in the future?’

Under the Lib Dem constitution  a leadership 
contest would be triggered if Mr Clegg chooses to call one or quit. 
Otherwise it requires Mr Clegg to lose a vote of confidence among his 
MPs or to face a call to resign from 75 constituency associations.

Many observers believe Mr Clegg will 
quit before the election – possibly at the party’s 2014 conference – 
unless the polls show major improvement.

Vince Cable is five times more popular with voters than his party leader, according to a new poll.

The YouGov survey found that the Lib Dem Business Secretary enjoys more support among both Lib Dem voters and the wider public.

Asked which of six senior ministers they respected the most, 17 per cent said Mr Cable, compared to just three per cent for Mr Clegg.

William Hague topped the poll with 22 per cent, David Cameron scored 12 per cent and the Chancellor George Osborne won just one per cent support.

Among Lib Dem voters, 51 per cent said they supported Mr Cable, compared to just 19 per cent for their party’s leader.

The findings will encourage those within the party who believe its best chance of survival is to install Mr Cable as leader before the next election.

The poll also highlights the sense of betrayal among many former Lib Dem voters.

Among those who voted Lib Dem in 2010 but say they will not do so again, just one per cent said Mr Clegg was ‘strong’, and just four per cent agreed that he ‘sticks to what he believes in’.

Among this group 28 per cent said they respected Mr Cable, compared to just two per cent for Mr Clegg.

ANALYSIS by ALEX BRUMMER

The call by Nick Clegg for an emergency wealth tax to help pay the nation’s bills looks like a throwback to the 1970s when then Labour Chancellor Denis Healey threatened to squeeze the rich ‘until the pips squeak’.

Instead of raising extra income, Healey’s attacks on the wealthy stifled economic growth and jobs creation and sent capital scurrying overseas.

It is, of course, deeply frustrating that some of the super-rich, like the comedian Jimmy Carr, seek to avoid paying tax by using complex schemes designed to keep Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) at bay.

But the answer to that problem is to bring in simpler and lower taxes, with fewer loopholes.

Out of sync: Nick Clegg¿s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy

The consequence of imposing surcharges or super-taxes on the rich is presently to be seen in France.

Since President Hollande came to power promising to raise the top rate of income tax to 75 per cent, more than half of France’s most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas or shift their money out of the country.

Hollande’s grotesque policy error has become Britain’s gain as many of the French wealth creators are setting up home in London as tax exiles taking advantage of the UK Government’s special scheme for non-domiciles and lower tax bands.

Clegg’s proposals fly in the face of modern tax policy. All the evidence suggests that the higher the marginal tax rate, the smaller amount of revenue it produces.

Wealth taxes act as a disincentive to work and wealth, and lead the individuals targeted to look for clever ways to avoid paying, move overseas or stop working altogether.

'Grotesque': More than half of France's most wealthy individuals have indicated that they intend to move overseas because of President Hollande's tax policies

The work of Professor Arthur Laffer of Southern California, author of the famous Laffer curves, demonstrates that if income taxes are slashed the incentives to work become greater and more wealth is created.

Lord (Nigel) Lawson’s adoption of this tax-cutting principle as part of the Thatcherite economic reforms produced a flood of new income for the Exchequer.

Of course it is not Clegg’s responsibility to design the nation’s tax system.In the much-derided March 2012 Budget one of the Chancellor’s biggest reforms, to be implemented next April, was to cut the 50 per cent emergency rate of income tax – imposed by Labour before it left office – to 45 per cent.

Labour has sought to portray this decision as a tax break for millionaires. The reality is that studies, carried out by the Treasury, show that above 45 per cent people resent paying their taxes, seek to avoid or try to persuade their employers (if they work for big companies) to move them overseas.

The result is a loss of tax revenue rather than a gain.

Moreover, because the 50 per cent rate is levied on a  PAYE basis, and is deducted directly from pay packets, it largely hits senior management both in the private and public sector rather than the super-rich.

Senior managers are also the principal victims of the removal of personal tax allowances for those earning over £100,000, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and high rates of stamp duty on their homes.

Osborne is already seeking to capture extra income from high-wealth individuals by abolishing the loopholes that allow ownership of some of the most expensive homes in Britain to be shifted offshore out of the range of HMRC.

Closing these loopholes has become a priority and is a much more efficient way of ensuring that the real millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.
