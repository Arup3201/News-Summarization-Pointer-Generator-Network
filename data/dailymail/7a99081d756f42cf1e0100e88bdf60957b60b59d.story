Amy Winehouse’s former boyfriend has been arrested on suspicion of rape.

Reg Traviss attended a police station by arrangement and was questioned about an allegation made to police on January 18.

Last night, friends said the 35-year-old film director was devastated by the claim, which one insisted had come out of the blue.

‘He does know the woman who made the report to police and he completely denies the allegation,’ a friend told the Daily Mail.

‘He wants to do everything in his power to fight this.’

Traviss was left heartbroken after Miss Winehouse died last July and told how he had planned to marry the 27-year-old singer.

He said he had gone through hell following his girlfriend’s death, adding: ‘Yes, absolutely, we had talked about getting married.

‘It wasn’t planned as in this date or that date, but it was a topic of conversation and had been for some time.’

He also spoke of the suddenness of the star’s death at a time when she was getting her life back on track and had beaten her drug addiction.

Toxicology tests showed there were no drugs in the singer’s system at the time of her death.

However, it was revealed at an inquest that she had 416mg of alcohol per decilitre of blood – five times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg. The inquest heard that 350mg could be a fatal amount.

Three empty vodka bottles were found near her body in her bedroom at home in Camden, North London. Traviss was told in a phone call from her security guard Andrew Morris that she had been found dead in bed.

He had been in a relationship with Miss Winehouse for two years before her death and their romance received the blessing of her parents.

Last night, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘A 35-year-old man was arrested by appointment on April 5 by officers from Westminster Sapphire unit in relation to an allegation of rape reported to police on January 18.

‘He is bailed to return to a Central London police station in early July.’
