Raheem Sterling's driving run saw him equalise for Liverpool after the break - click here for our brilliant matchzone service

It was what one might call a Michael Owen moment. Maybe a Jimmy Greaves moment for those whose memory extends to football's golden age. Raheem Sterling turned and ran, straight at the heart of the Chelsea defence. You know, like the great goalscorers do.

In that instant of pure athletic acceleration nobody could live with him. Not Nemanja Matic, the stand-out defensive midfield player of this season, not Gary Cahill who appeared to be plodding through quick-drying cement by comparison. 

Sterling, having dropped deep to receive the pass, was reaching top gear as he arrived in the penalty area, yet he didn't look at all hurried. As Thibaut Courtois began his advance he slipped the ball smartly past him and into the far corner. It was a gem of a goal, worthy of winning any match. That it only achieved parity for Liverpool is testament to Chelsea's defensive resilience. 

It was going to take something exceptional to breach that defence, and Sterling provided it.

Credit, also, to his manager Brendan Rodgers. After the Christmas and New Year fixtures he gave Sterling time off to recharge his batteries, as promised. 

Sterling was pictured holidaying in Jamaica. Some mocked. Who do they think they are these softy footballers, unable to play a full season without taking off to the Caribbean? And how foolish is that mug of a manager to fall for it? Yet Sterling played as if revived. 

Eden Hazard comfortably stroked home a penalty in the 18th minute to give Chelsea the lead against Liverpool on Tuesday night

He was a proper handful, buzzing around Chelsea's back line, desperately trying to make up for the absence of a genuine striker in Liverpool's ranks. With Daniel Sturridge still missing it speaks volumes that Rodgers prefers Sterling to either Rickie Lambert or Mario Balotelli. Certainly it is hard to imagine either of his rivals scoring a goal of that quality on current form. 

Just like Sterling's trip to Jamaica, that was a bold managerial move. It would have been very easy for Mourinho to keep Petr Cech in goal for one last game - particularly as this competition is regarded as the least important of Chelsea's quartet of campaigns. 

Instead, Courtois was recalled immediately, and was superb in keeping Liverpool at bay. He saved from Philippe Coutinho in the 67th minute, from Jordan Henderson after 75 minutes and from Sterling again when he tried to capitalise on the rebound a second later.

True, Courtois rode his luck when, in gathering the ball under pressure from Sterling, he began to slide out of his area and regained control only with his elbow. 

It should have been a free-kick for handling, and in a dangerous area just outside the box, but referee Martin Atkinson waved it away. Moments later, the Belgian made amends with a quite magnificent stop from Sterling. Without him, this match could have got away from Chelsea. 

They will most certainly have felt greatly relieved when Steven Gerrard shot against the post after 66 minutes. Coutinho set him up and the goal was open in front of The Kop. 

Perhaps he tried to place it too perfectly. With the momentum of a Gerrard goal at the right end, Liverpool's head of steam may have proved unstoppable.

Gerrard was taken off soon after, no doubt with mixed emotions. He had more than played his part in Liverpool's comeback but that miss will have weighed heavily. It will be all about him again at Stamford Bridge, too, with Chelsea's travelling contingent ignoring Mourinho's plea to show respect for a great player.

The game hadn't even kicked off when the blue corner began taunting Liverpool's captain about the famous slip. The home fans immediately replied with their tribute and at one point in the first half the entire ground was singing Gerrard's name, with levels of appreciation at opposite extremes. 

Gerrard has heard it all before, of course, and as expected no man did more to try to get Liverpool's noses in front. This being his last season at Anfield there is almost an entire area of The Kop reserved for Gerrard-related banners. 

'The best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be,' said the largest, and most poetic - although it's a depressing thought if the best Liverpool will ever have retires without a league championship winners medal. 

A more attainable ambition was contained in the message 'Get Gerrard to Wembley'. As usual, though, if you want anything done properly do it yourself, and in the first half at least the duties of propelling Liverpool forward fell to the usual suspect again. 

It was Gerrard who forced the only two saves from Courtois in the first half, Gerrard who was involved in just about every Liverpool move that was memorable or incisive. A fierce shot, 35 yards out, demanded the first stop of the game, then, when Gary Cahill fouled Sterling on the left, it was Gerrard who curled a vicious free-kick in from a tight angle, bringing Courtois into action once more.

That he did this in front of Chelsea’s mocking fans made the attempt all the more ambitious. Every neutral must have secretly wished for the perfect retort. The effect of his absence next season is close to incalculable. 

Chelsea, by contrast, had one first-half chance, and took it - from the penalty spot. 

Cesc Fabregas played the ball inside to Eden Hazard, who was bundled over clumsily by Emre Can. Atkinson had no doubt and Hazard stepped up to capitalise on his work. Belgian against Belgian, he sent Simon Mignolet the wrong way, planting the ball low to the right. 

Liverpool will claim the award was soft, but they won’t have much of a case. Can took a chance stepping into Hazard; a penalty the likely outcome. Knowing what we know of Chelsea it was always a foolhardy move. Goals like Sterling’s come rarely, Chelsea nick results like this in their sleep.
