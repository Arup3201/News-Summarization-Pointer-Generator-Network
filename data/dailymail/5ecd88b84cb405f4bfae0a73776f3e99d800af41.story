The Facebook page of a mother who abandoned her two daughters in Brooklyn was updated with a photograph of a seemingly naked man holding a bottle of champagne hours after the children were dumped.

Police were looking for Dalisha Adams around Canarsie, Brooklyn, at around 6.15pm on Sunday when the image of the pink champagne was uploaded.

Dominae, five, and three-year-old Diani were found shaken and confused in front of Bay View Houses - around a mile-and-a-half from their home in Breukelen Houses.

Abandoned: Dominae, five, left, and her younger sister Diani, three, said their mom Dalisha, dropped them near a busy intersection in Brooklyn and drove off

Mother: Dalisha Adams was arrested on Sunday night after abandoning her two daughters, aged five and three

Adams, 26, was arrested at around 11pm on Sunday night - more than four hours after the image was posted on her Facebook page.

Two women discovered the two little girls and stayed with them until police arrived.

They were bundled up warm wearing hooded down coats and Ugg boots at the housing project on Shore Parkway, the New York Daily News reported.

A neighbour of the mother, who also has another eight-year-old daughter, said she often heard Adams screaming at her children.

She told the New York Daily News: 'She was always yelling at the kids, "shut the f*** up".

'One day, I heard her curse out the little baby, "I'll punch you in the f***ing face".'

The woman also said she heard more shouting on Sunday, shortly before the girls were abandoned.

'A kid was crying. She was saying, "stop crying, shut the f*** up. I'm gonna get you out of here",' she said.

Dominae was able to remember she 
lived in a blue house with flowers in front of it on 53rd street, but 
did not know which borough of New York it was.

She told a photographer: 'Mommy just left us on the sidewalk and drove away.'

She also said her mother's name was Dalisha and she drove a white car.

Abandoned: The children were left near this busy intersection in Shore Parkway, Brooklyn

The children showed no signs of physical abuse but were taken to Brookdale University Hospital for observation.

Just after 10pm on Sunday night, police arrived at Adams' house and opened the door with a crow bar, but she was not at home.

Adams was arrested after police matched the girls' identity with photo records from Administration for Children’s Services, where the children are currently in custody.

Adams was charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, police said.

Police were alerted to the the abandoned children by an elderly couple who found them standing at a busy intersection with the diapers in their arms as cars zoomed by them.

Rescue: A good samaritan found the children near Bayview Housing Projects on Shore Parkway in Brooklyn, with their extra diapers and called police

Heroes: Police Officers Billy Morales and his partner Ed Centeno made sure they were safe after taking them from the two elderly woman who found them

Grandmother: Bertha Davia said she thinks it has all been a misunderstanding and Dalisha was supposed to leave the girls with her

The girls’ grandmother, Bertha Davia, said it was all a misunderstanding and is asking ACS to place them in her care.

The 52-year-old told Eyewitness News that she lives in the complex next to where the children were left and the mother must have intended to leave her children in her care.

She said she is furious her daughter never told her the children were coming and only realised what had happened when she saw their picture on the news.

'She left them on the corner here. I live all the way over there. And they was roaming the hallways and all that. Why would she do that to my grandkids? For what reason?'

Although she is angry over the incident, she said she does not believe the two girls were abandoned on a street corner and it was just a big misunderstanding.

Michelle Davis, 43, from Brooklyn, told the Daily News: 'They were wandering up and down the sidewalk for a while, just playing by themselves.

'It’s horrible. How could you leave your own children out there? They’re babies and you just leave them out there like that?'

The police said both children were in good condition after being checked over in hospital and were now in the care of the ACS, who did not immediately respond to an inquiry.
