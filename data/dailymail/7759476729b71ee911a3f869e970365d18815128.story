Theresa May has today warned police there is a risk the public will be scared to dial 999 if they fear being sued by officers responding to emergency calls.

The Home Secretary told the Police Federation national conference that she wanted to stop 'frivolous' claims being made by officers.

WPC Kelly Jones triggered a furious backlash after it emerged she was suing a garage owner in Norfolk after tripping on a kerb while investigating a burglary.

Compensation warning: Theresa May addresses the Police Federation annual conference today in Bournemouth where she warned there is a risk the public will be scared to dial 999 if they fear being sued by officers

The officer, 33, is also demanding compensation from Norfolk Constabulary for a knee injury sustained in an accident in a police car.

The case prompted Mrs May to order a review of police compensation amid fears it may be deterring victims of crime from coming forward.

In the latest example of police suing taking legal action for accidents at work, it emerged today that an unnamed South Yorkshire officer was awarded £8,000 compensation by their employers after slipping on ice and snow.

Addressing the annual Police 
Federation conference in Bournemouth, Theresa May also pledged to change
the law so criminals who kill police officers face minimum whole-life 
jail terms.

Receiving a more restrained reception 
than last year, when she was confronted by heckling and calls to resign,
Mrs May also announced further prosecution powers for the police so 
they can bring charges against minor shoplifters.

Payouts: Theresa May, with Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, warned about the risks of a compensation culture in the police following a number of high profile claims

'I know that the vast majority of you
are dedicated public servants of the best kind. But when a police 
officer sues a member of the public because they slipped on private 
property – that is simply not the sort of attitude police officers 
should exhibit,' she said.

'I want to work with the Federation to make sure police officers don't make frivolous claims.

'Not least because it would be quite wrong if people become reluctant to call the police for fear of being sued.'

Last
month it emerged PC Richard Seymour is suing a burglary victim after he
allegedly tore his Achilles tendon when he fell into a drain while 
investigating a break-in in Surrey in 2012.

He is suing for ‘loss of overtime’ during his six-month absence from work despite being on full pay.

Outrage: WPC Kelly Jones took action against a garage owner after tripping on a kerb while responding to a 999 call

Today it was revealed an officer in South Yorkshire was awarded £8,162 after breaking a leg and damaging ligaments when slipping on black ice.

Another worker received £1,000 after suffering a laceration putting a plug into a socket and two firearms officers received payouts after they were hit by spent cartridges during training.

An officer was given £1,500 after a colleague accidentally shut a van door on his hand.

Details of payouts worth £21,412 made to officers over a two-year period were released under freedom of information laws.

Legal action: The garage where WPC Jones slipped on a kerb while responding to a burglary call

A police officer in South Yorkshire was awarded more than £8,000 compensation after slipping on ice, it emerged today.

Since 2011, 14 payouts have been made to officers for injuries suffered at work, new figures have revealed.

They included:-

Since 2011, 34 staff at South Yorkshire 
Police have lodged compensation claims against their employer and 20 are
still outstanding.

Addressing the conference today, Mrs May also said the Government is to 
propose that the starting point for anyone convicted of the murder of a 
police officer in the line of duty should be increased to whole life 
without parole from a current minimum of 30 years.

Receiving a round of applause from 
officers in attendance, Mrs May said: 'The murder of a police officer is
a particularly appalling crime. To attack and kill a police officer is to attack the fundamental basis of our society.'

She added: 'That is why I can 
announce today that, subject to consultation with the Sentencing 
Council, the Government will change the law so that the starting point 
for anybody who kills a police officer should be a life sentence without
parole.

'We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.'

There have been 12 direct killings of
police officers in the course of duty since 2000 - including the murder
of Pcs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in Greater Manchester last year.

Mrs May said she wanted to increase 
the number of police-led prosecutions to empower officers to deal with a
wider range of offences where people plead guilty.

In the last year, police officers 
have been given control over the prosecution of offences including drunk
and disorderly to criminal damage - rather than handing a file to the 
Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

She said: 'I know that dealing with 
the CPS on minor offences wastes a great deal of your time, and I know 
how frustrating that can be.

'That’s why I can announce today that
I will increase the scope of police-led prosecutions to include 
shoplifting of goods worth £200 or less.

'That means up to another 50,000 
prosecutions being led by the police - cases that will be dealt with 
faster and more effectively.'
