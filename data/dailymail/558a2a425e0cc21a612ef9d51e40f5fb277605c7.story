You'd be forgiven for thinking that paying for excess baggage on skiing holidays would ensure guests leave with everything they arrived with.

But ski resorts have seen a record amount of lost property this season with some bizarre items left behind beggaring belief, according to one specialist tour operator.

Crystal Ski Holidays has compiled a lost property inventory from December to January that ranges from predictable apparel such as goggles and long johns to dentures and a frightening number of mankinis.

Three pairs of Spanx, two unwrapped Christmas presents, a customised flute, a set of dentures and a life-size cutout of EastEnders character Lucy Beale, played by actress Hetti Bywater, have also been discovered.

The list of items includes 98 Santa hats, 756 empty bottles of alcohol and a walking stick.

A spokesperson for Crystal Ski Holidays said: 'With our resorts accommodating more than several hundred-thousand guests this season, its unsurprising that so much lost property was left behind, however some of the more bizarre items have caused disbelief for our staff.

'We expect a number of ski-related items to be left behind, but the life-size cut out of Lucy Beale was somewhat of a surprise, especially as none of our staff saw "her" entering the chalet. 

'We can confirm she was still in good condition when we found her.'

The spokesperson added: 'What has been interesting in the finds is that you can start to track the trends of our customers. 

'Despite Borat being released in the cinema nearly 10 years ago, the mankini is still a "style" trend, and the selfie stick, which was touted as the "must-have" Christmas present was obviously not popular with 17 of our customers.'

A similar study by travel website SkyScanner investigated the unusual things left behind on planes. It found that passengers had discarded or forgotten to take with them a wedding ring, trombone, false teeth and even a fridge.
