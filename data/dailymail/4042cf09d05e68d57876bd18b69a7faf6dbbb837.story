Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to co-operate with a new Royal Charter enshrining a newspaper watchdog

One of David Cameron’s closest ministerial allies has attacked plans to regulate the 300-year-old free Press.

Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to co-operate with a new Royal Charter enshrining a newspaper watchdog. They should also mount a legal challenge to the way the Government has handled the issue.

The remarks by the planning minister, a member of the Prime Minister’s inner circle, are by far the strongest criticism from a member of the Government of a cross-party deal imposing a new system of regulation on the industry.

Mr Boles said of the Royal Charter on Press regulation, published last week: ‘There’s nothing we’ve done that troubles me as much as this.’

He said the best argument Culture Secretary Maria Miller could muster to justify it was that Labour and the Liberal Democrats were threatening to join forces to push through something more draconian.

Mr Boles also launched a strong attack on his Lib Dem Coalition colleagues, saying their stance was ‘completely amazing’ from a party that likes ‘spouting guff about liberalism’.

He added: ‘One of the strands that connects Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and modern Conservatives is freedom under the rule of law. We do not believe in freedom under the watchful eye and wagging finger of a state-sponsored regulator.’

The minister’s remarks, in an interview with the ConservativeHome website, cast serious doubt on the future of the cross-party plan and suggest it does not command support at the top of government.

The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages in privacy and other cases.

However, senior figures including Lord
Lester, an eminent QC who is the architect of reforms to Britain’s 
notorious libel laws, have suggested that will violate Article 10 of the
European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of 
expression.

Last week, the 
three main parties finally agreed the detail of a Royal Charter setting 
up a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry 
into media standards.

'One of the strands that connects Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and modern Tories is freedom under the rule of law.

'We do not believe in freedom under the wagging finger of a state-sponsored regulator,'

Nick Boles, Planning Minister

An alternative proposal by the Press, 
which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative 
powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million, up-front 
corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and 
independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected.

It
is thought to be the first time that the Queen has been asked to sign a
Royal Charter imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry.

Mr
Boles said that the strongest argument put by Mrs Miller was ‘that if 
it didn’t go through, Labour and the Liberal Democrats would do 
something much worse through explicit statutory legislation’.

He
added: ‘If you ask yourself a simple question “Would a 
Conservative-only government be doing this?”, I think the answer is 
unquestionably “No”.’

He said the proposal ‘does not compel any publisher of any news publication to co-operate with it. All it does is create this [pressure to co-operate] through the punitive damages. So there is absolutely no legal reason why any publisher needs to play along with it.’

Mr Boles went on to suggest that the use of the Privy Council, a ministerial body which advises the Queen, and the Royal prerogative to impose the regime was a ‘pretty big constitutional innovation’ and suggested the Press should challenge it. He likened the use of the Privy Council and the Royal prerogative to ‘Alice in Wonderland’.

Three out of four voters believe there is a risk that future governments would use a legal system of press regulation to try to stop newspapers from criticising them.

A YouGov poll for the Sun also found that 45 per cent agree it is vital that a free press is protected.

He said it would be ‘very reasonable’ for the Press to want to ‘establish whether each and every one of the steps that has been undertaken to set up these structures has been properly undertaken’.

‘This is a very, very big constitutional innovation, using a mechanism that is itself a pretty arcane piece of constitutional machinery.’

He added that by their behaviour over Press freedom, the Lib Dems have shown that they are not liberal. ‘What I find completely amazing is how they can carry on spouting guff about Gladstone and liberalism…while co-operating with statist Labour to try to bring in a much more draconian system of state regulation of the Press.’

The editor of the New York Times has said she would ‘probably not sign up’ to a charter for state regulation.

Jill Abramson, arguably the most powerful Press figure outside the UK, also said US journalists had more freedom than their counterparts here. ‘The Press in Britain has more restrictions on it than we do,’ she told BBC’s Newsnight.
