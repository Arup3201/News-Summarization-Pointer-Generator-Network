He loves beer, red wine, headbanging to Status Quo and kicked out his girlfriend because they kept arguing but this Jack the Lad is a parrot.

Six-year-old blue and gold macaw Jack loves popping down to his local pub for a pint of best and once got so drunk on Rioja he fell off his perch.

But he is at his happiest when he's rocking out and squawking all over the world to his favourite band Status Quo.

Owner Norie MacKinnon, of East Kilbride, Scotland, said: 'He loves Quo. He headbangs to them all the time. They're his favourite band.

'It's hilarious when he gets going, his bangs his head back and forward in time with the music. He even tries to sing along to songs like Whatever You Want but it just comes out as a squawk.

'He likes other music - he's quite keen on Billy Idol and he likes a bit of jazz - but Status Quo are far and away his favourite.'

Mr MacKinnon, 54, an A&E nurse at Hairmyres Hospital, bought his pet for Â£1,500 from a friend six years ago.

Jack's not much for conversation but he does say 'geez a kiss' and 'where's my boy?'

Jack was only three months old at the time but his friend's wife didn't like him.

Father-of-one Norie said: 'He's named after Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and he is a right Jack the lad.

'A couple of years ago I bought a mate for him, a female blue and gold macaw called Cheeky, but he couldn't stand her so she had to go. I think she cramped his style.'

Who's a tipsy boy then? Jack loves beer, red wine, headbanging to Status Quo and kicked out his girlfriend because they kept arguing

When Jack's had enough of his owner's company he screeches 'night night'

Jack's not much for conversation but he does say 'geez a kiss' and 'where's my boy?' and when he's had enough of his owner's company he screeches 'night night'.

He regularly accompanies Mr MacKinnon to his local pub, the Stewartfield Farm in East Kilbride, where he enjoys sipping away at a pint of Caledonian Best.

Mr MacKinnon said: 'He loves his beer and red wine. But one night at home I heard a clunk and turned round to see he'd fallen off his perch. He'd had too much wine.

'Nowadays I buy him a pint down the pub and he just takes a few sips out of it.

'He's a great character and a great companion. I love Status Quo too so we rock out together.'
