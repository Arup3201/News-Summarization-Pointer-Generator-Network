Hackers proclaiming allegiance to ISIS broke into a Twitter account for a military families' support organization and used it to threaten soldiers' wives.

The shady group took over an account on the social network operated by the Military Spouses for Strength nonprofit, then used it to target women who had spoken out against their jihadist organization.

'You think you're safe but the IS [Islamic State] is already here', the hijacked account blasted out to six military wives in succession.

'#CyberCaliphate got into your PC and your smartphone.'

The victims were seemingly handpicked because they spoke out in an earlier story about jihadist hackers turning on the military.

In the wake of the Twitter account for the Pentagon's Central Command being compromised, the women had spoken to CNN for an article published in January.

Liz Snell, who runs Military Spouses for Strength, told the network then: I see being online as a way to stay honest, to stay healthy, to help.

'I don't want that to be hurt because of some threats that are just some dumb hacker. I don't want to let them win that way.'

The women, who largely agreed that they would not be intimidated, ended up on the hackers' hitlist as a result.

Threats: These messages were sent to six military wives. Threats were also sent to President Obama

Some tweets posted from the account also contained threats to President Obama and his family, NBC reported. The account has since been suspended, and the messages in question deleted.

Amy Bushatz, an officer's wife who was targeted, said she was shaken by the messages. She also got sent a friend request from a man apparently affiliated with the hacking group.

She told CNN: 'I would be lying if I didn't say it (made) me a little nervous, I don't think you can receive what appears to be a personal threat from ISIS without being nervous.'

However, writing later in a blog post she said she had no intention of 'giving them the victory' of staying afraid.
