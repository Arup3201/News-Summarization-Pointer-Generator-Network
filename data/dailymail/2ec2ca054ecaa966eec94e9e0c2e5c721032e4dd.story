England's stars headed to Turin to face Italy as Roy Hodgson's men seek revenge for their World Cup defeat last summer.

Both England and Italy exited at the group stage in Brazil, but the Italians did at least manage one win, beating Hodgson's side in the opening game in Manaus.

But a new-look squad, led by Harry Kane, who scored on his debut last Friday, flew out on Monday hoping to set the record straight when the sides meet in Tuesday evening's friendly

England have been in excellent form in qualifying, the 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley marking their fifth straight competitive win since the debacle in Brazil. 

And with captain Wayne Rooney, who scored again on Friday, primed to match Bobby Charlton's England goalscoring record, there is optimism again for the Three Lions. 

But they are now set to be tested by a stronger side for the first time, in the shape of Antonio Conte's team.

The Italians however have had a testing time of things since the World Cup, sitting second in their qualifying group after snatching a late goal away to Bulgaria in their last match.
