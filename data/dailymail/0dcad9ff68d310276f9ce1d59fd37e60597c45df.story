Sometimes it's difficult to know what to wear while travelling.

Do you opt for smart - looking good but feeling slightly restricted - or wear casual clothes for optimal comfort?

If you're the Bathrobe Crusader you go for none of the above - instead, touring the world wearing a dressing gown.

Cultural experience: The traveller is pictured inside Marie Antoinette's private retreat in the grounds of Versailles

The social media traveller is currently touring Europe, posting photos of himself wearing the casual nighttime attire on Instagram.

So far he has just 200 followers, but writes that it doesn't matter to him.

On the site, his profile adds: 'Mr Bathrobe Crusader. Changing the world before before he changes his clothes.

Among the crowds: The Bathrobe Crusader can be seen in front of the Mona Lisa at The Louvre in Paris

Appropriate attire: The student can be seen wandering the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles

'Follow, or don't, he doesn't care, he only crusades.'

Little is known about the wander, except that he's a University of Southern California student.

From a photo of him in front of Big Ben in London, to him pictured looking at a Monet painting in Paris, the Bathrobe Crusader is certainly making the most of his time travelling Europe.

He's also posted snaps in Versailles, in the Louvre Museum in France, and reading a paper in Amsterdam.

He told www.brobible.com: 'I am traveling Europe for the summer in style and have created a new Instagram, @bathrobecrusader. 

'I am a student at the University of Southern California. 

'For example, I will be in Tropez soon with a group of ballers (for lack of a better word), and will be getting tables at VIP Room and will walk in wearing my bathrobe.

'I have been doing this at clubs in different countries almost every night and at famous attractions almost every day.'
