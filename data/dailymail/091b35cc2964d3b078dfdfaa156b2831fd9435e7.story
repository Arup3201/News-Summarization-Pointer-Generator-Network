The decomposed body of Theresa DeKeyzer was found stuffed inside a 55-gallon plastic drum at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing.

Results from an autopsy of the Michigan woman's remains checked over the weekend.

DeKeyzer's boyfriend Scott Wobbe reported that he last saw the 22-year-old on June 16 near her Warren home, police said.

The boyfriend has been jailed for violating probation in a Midland County drug case.

Horror: The decomposed body of Theresa DeKeyzer was found stuffed inside a 55-gallon plastic drum at a Detroit-area storage facility three months after she was reported missing

X-ray equipment was used to help determine the contents of the barrel, according to the state police

Since her disappearance, DeKeyzer hadn't used her cellphone, accessed her bank account or picked up her paycheck, The Detroit News reported earlier this month.

In her home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety.

The body was found Thursday at Travel Trailer Storage in Plymouth Township after Warren police executed a search warrant, Plymouth Township detective Charlie Rozum said.

Police were led to the facility after receiving tips.

The trailer was later removed, storage facility manager Doris Temple told the Detroit Free Press.

Temple, who has worked at the facility for over 30 years, said the discovery terrified her.

'I've never had anything like this happen, and it's kind of frightening for me,' Temple said.

Temple said a man had rented the storage facility nine days before DeKeyzer disappeared.

DeKeyzer had been assaulted the night before her disappearance by boyfriend Scott Wobbe, right, who is considered the main suspect

Both storage facility employees and police said they were disturbed by the bizarre and gruesome discovery at the Michigan storage locker

She declined to identify the renter to reporters.

'It was an enclosed trailer, it had no windows, no nothing, just the back opens, that's it,' she said. 'Sixteen feet long, maybe.'

Rozum said investigators believe the barrel was filled with sand and was sealed with a concrete cap. He said the barrel was inside a small trailer.

X-ray equipment was used to help determine the contents of the barrel, according to the state police.

The body was removed from the barrel Friday with the assistance of a forensic anthropologist, said Mary Mazur, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County medical examiner's office.

DeKeyzer was identified by her tattoos, clothing, and jewelry.

There were also crime scene photos available from a domestic assault reported the day before her disappearance when, according to police, a drunken Wobbe assaulted her.

Wobbe reportedly dragged her out of his car by her shirt and punched her in the face.

'Obviously, the discovery is linked to the suspect in the case,' Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green told Detroit CBS, referring to Wobbe.

DeKeyzer's family said they had been rocked by the horrifying discovery but were survivors

In DeKeyzer's home, police found that she had left behind her cellphone charger, a half-finished cigarette resting in an ashtray, and a medical marijuana card prescribed for depression/anxiety

Wobbe is now in jail on drug charges and for violating his probation with the assault.

Green said he too had been disturbed by this unique crime.

'It was quite disturbing to see a 22-year-old young gal stuff in a 55-gallon drum and cement poured over her in the fetal position,' he said.Â 

DeKeyzer's family said they were devastated.

'My heart breaks for my cousins and my aunt,' Melody Baetens, a Detroit New staff writer and cousing to the victim told the paper. 'They have a lot of family support and they're going to get through it.

'The DeKeyzers have been through a lot these last few years, and they don't deserve this. But there's a lot of love in this family, and we're all here for them.'
