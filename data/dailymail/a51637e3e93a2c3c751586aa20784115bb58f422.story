A loving wife died of a 'broken heart' just days after her husband of 62 years passed away.

Nora Spencer, 83, died just days after her husband of more than six decades Edward Spencer lost his battled with cancer, aged 86.

The loving pair, who lived together at Amherst House Care Home in Horley, Surrey, raised seven children during their remarkable marriage - and have 32 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

In a public tribute written on behalf of the family after her death, son Stephen said: 'Painless peace, rest was called, sadly missed and loved by all - night night, God bless.'

Edward Spencer met his future wife Nora during his National Service in the early 1950s - and only spent 17 days away from her in 62 years of marriage.

Originally from Leeds, Mr Spencer was stationed at the Chatham Naval Docks in Kent, where he met his future wife - who he lovingly called his 'Chatham Cutie.'

Within a matter of weeks, the couple married and they moved together to Crawley, West Sussex.

The pair raised seven children at the same family home, before moving to nearby Southgate.

As their health began failing with age, the lifelong companions moved together to the same care home, in order to not be apart.

Mr Spencer lost his battle against cancer on October 13, and his heartbroken widow, who suffered from Alzheimer's and dementia, passed away just 17 days later.

Their son Stephen thanked the carers who made his parents' last days as comfortable as possible.

He said: 'The family would like to express their fondest gratitude to Arthur Tanare and his dedicated staff at Amherst House, Horley.

'They excelled in not only their care, but their awareness and vigilance regarding Nora's Alzheimer's and dementia whilst supporting the family during such difficult times.

'Also special thanks to staff at Walstead Court, Southgate, for providing 24-hour care for the past three years and St Catherine's Hospice for their specialist support and care in making Edward comfortable during the final stages of his battle with cancer.'
