Just over a month ago Joachim Low’s team arrived in Brazil with the mentality of champions. They bullied and beat everything in sight.

Ask Per Mertesacker, a late substitute in the Maracana, what it takes to be a World Cup winner and he will tell you.

‘You think a Mickey Mouse team reaches the last eight of the World Cup?’ he snorted after they needed extra-time to beat Algeria 2-1 in Porto Alegre. On Sunday they hit all their targets.

Germany know, more than any other team in the history of the World Cup, what it takes to go deep into tournament territory.

So, too, does their coach. He raised four fingers at Frankfurt airport to signal their intent to win win a fourth World Cup.

Now he can flick two fingers at anyone who doubted him.

This has been a Slow Burn for the David Bowie lookalike, with near misses in the final of Euro 2008, the World Cup semi-final in 2010 and the last four of Euro 2012.

Here they have been regarded as the best prepared team at the tournament for some time: Best players, best training ground, best coach, best everything.

However much they will crow about the number of coaches in Germany after their fourth triumph, it takes a special unit to be together for seven weeks. It is far more than tricks and flicks.

This was a target tournament, something every player involved with the German national team had made abundantly clear as they criss-crossed their way around this incredible country.

If it felt and sounded ballsy, they backed it up on the biggest stage of all. They are footballing gods now.

From Germany with Low: The Mannschaft boss celebrates at the final whistle

Low, along with some of the world’s finest footballers - Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and, well, the list is endless - are staring down from heaven now.

Quite how Argentina, Brazil, Holland, Italy and others - yes, even England - retaliate remains to be seen. It hurts to even type it.

This team is Low’s baby now and by end the time the final whistle went, everyone involved with the German national team was blubbing.

Mario Gotze got the goal, beautifully taken on his chest with the first touch and rifled beyond Sergio Romero with his second after 113 minutes.

They had been rough around the edges until then and yet, somehow, you always knew they were going to win it.

No matter how good Germany’s squad is, dealing with an unexpected event - an injury to one of their most influential players before kick-off - is never easy.

Whatever happened in those moments after Sami Khedira pulled up lame in the warm-up, it upset Germany’s rhythm. It threw them out of kilter.

Even Khedira’s replacement didn’t last long, with Christoph Kramer taken off with a head injury after just 32 minutes. Soon enough Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle was on.

Still, Germany expects and the problem, after victories over Portugal, United States, Algeria, France and that extraordinary win over Brazil, is that so did everybody else.

After victory here, it doesn’t matter that those powerful powerful combinations we have become accustomed to were spluttering.

Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller down the right; Toni Kroos and Bastian Schweinsteiger in the centre; Mesut Ozil and Miroslav Klose through the middle.

Kroos was unsettled, ruffled by the menacing presence of Javier Mascherano and Enzo Perez in the centre of midfield. It was congested and dirty at times.

The two Argentinians are the types to wait in dark alleys in the dead of night and rob you blind of all your gear. This was another ambush.

Kroos’ elementary first half mistake, a dopey, looping header over the top of Mats Hummels and his defensive partner Jerome Boateng gave Gonzalo Higuain a free run on goal. Inexplicably he fired wide.

Kroos had a couple of chances, the best of them he sent wide of Romero’s left hand post.

We had come to expect better from one of the stars of the tournament, but Low can pick over the bones of this performance at a later date.

All that counts is the fact that this victory - the first by a European team on south American soil - has been in the calendar for quite some time.
