Barcelona star Luis Suarez has warned Liverpool that MLS-bound Steven Gerrard is 'irreplaceable', but backed the club captain to return to Anfield in the future.

Suarez spent three years on Merseyside before making a £75million move to La Liga last summer. The Uruguayan forward credits Gerrard with having a huge impact on his career and insisted manager Brendan Rodgers will find it virtually impossible to replace him when he leaves at the end of the season. 

'There are a small number of players in the world that are irreplaceable, and Steven is one of them. Suarez told the Mirror. 'Not just irreplaceable as a player, but also as a captain, and what he represents for Liverpool.

'Liverpool are a great team though, big players will want to play for them. They have great midfield players already there who can make a step up - and I am sure the boss is already thinking about replacements.'

Gerrard hinted that he doesn't see his imminent departure to LA Galaxy as the end of his association with Liverpool, and Suarez is inclined to agree. 

He said: 'I can't speak about what Steven's plans are after he retires from the game, only he will know if he wants to go into coaching or not.

'All I can say is that it would never surprise me to see him return to Liverpool in some capacity. To say he loves the club would not do his feelings for Liverpool justice, Liverpool is a part of him.'
