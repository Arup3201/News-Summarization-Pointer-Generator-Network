Before: Angela with her normal straight hair

Memories of my Eighties childhood are speckled with images of my mother, wafting around the house before a night out, her head laden with heated rollers and pins, like a perfumed porcupine.

Dynasty and Dallas were the TV shows of the day and hair was big. The heated rollers were Mum's weapons in her life-long battle to tease a little Krystle Carrington va-va-voom into her naturally straight tresses.

She stayed loyal to her trusty Remingtons over the next 30 years, even as big hair fell out of fashion. In fact, it was that trusty box of rollers that elicited the biggest pang of nostalgia when I cleared out her things following her death, at the age of 81, in August. How could I possibly throw them away?

I'm glad I didn't; big hair is back. With the Duchess of Cambridge and Cheryl Cole sporting big, bouncy, curly styles that would make Krystle - and Mum - proud, heated rollers are essential again. But how would Mum's rollers compete against the latest, 2013 versions? I put them to the test.

The Enrapture effect: The final result

This set of 20 rollers - ten large for 
'extra volume curves' and ten medium for 'extreme curl' - are stored and
 heated simultaneously on four lines of horizontal metal bars in a case 
the size of a large handbag. Butterfly clips are attached round the 
rollers so they get a blast of heat, too. An LED light goes red when the
 rollers are ready.

EASE OF USE: The rollers have a lovely velvet feel and take only two minutes to heat. There are plenty of them for my thick hair. The clips do get a little hot to handle, but thankfully they don't burn your head. Rolled out easily after 15 minutes.

RESULT: Delivered a nice overall bounce rather than cascading waves. Not for lovers of really BIG hair if yours is quite long. But a good, mid-priced buy.

BEST FOR: Thick hair. 3/5

Budget: Remington Jumbo Curls Rollers

Ah Remington, the brand beloved of my mum. They have certainly come a long way. Only eight medium sized and four larger rollers, pictured right, each with a wax core that, according to the blurb, helps retain a high heat, setting curls faster. Each roller fits on a vertical bar so they heat simultaneously.

EASE OF USE: Velvety and bristle-free, these rollers took nearly 15 minutes to heat. There's no indicator light so I had to guess. Even then, they still didn't feel too hot and it was fiddly getting the hair clips in place, resulting in some minor temper issues.

RESULT: They give a tightly flicked curl rather than a cascading wave, but a reasonable price.

BEST FOR: Budget buyers 2/5

The set has 12 large, soft-to-the-touch, thermo-ceramic rollers that, so it's claimed, give a smooth, shiny finish. Like the Enrapture brand, the rollers line up on horizontal heated bars within the case, so they are easy to store.

EASE OF USE: They take about three minutes to heat - a dot on top of each roller turns from red to white when they are ready - and they fasten into hair with easy-to-handle butterly clips.

RESULT: Produces long waves rather than full curls - but since the rollers are quite large the overall look is quite soft. My hair had a nice bounce but nobody's going to invite me to join Girls Aloud any time soon.

BEST FOR: Clumsy fingers 3/5

These are the lightest and most portable. Twelve medium-sized rollers come complete with easy-to-use metal clips in a neat little zip-up storage case.

EASE OF USE: Unfortunately you can heat up only six of the rollers - on vertical bars in the bottom of the case - at a time. Since the appliance takes ten minutes to reach a decent temperature to begin with, then a further six minutes to heat each set of rollers, getting the full set ready tested my patience. At least the rollers felt quite hot once they were in.

RESULT: Oh dear - this resulted in straggly rats' tails, rather than big bouncy curls, and they dropped out fairly quickly. Redeemed only by the nice case and price.

BEST FOR: Travelling light 1/5

It may look like a small pudding bowl with a plug on the end but this, apparently, is the new dawn in hair rollers. And it is known as a pod: you pop rollers in individually and, thanks to the wonders of induction, they heat up in eight seconds. When the pod is ready, the word DIVA lights up - a lovely touch. But it's not cheap: you buy the rollers separately; they come in three sizes, and at nearly £30 for four that's serious cash.

EASE OF USE: They feel heavy and hot on my head - just wearing four gave me a headache. The comb clips were a bit scratchy, too.

RESULT: Fantastic. Big, generous waves fell around my face and I saw myself reborn as Holly Willoughby.

BEST FOR: Quick results 5/5.

Another one to rely on the pod system, the Velcro rollers are placed in one at a time and when ready to use eight seconds later, the pod bleeps and a blue light flashes. Better value than the Diva as you get 14 rollers - two large, eight medium and four small.

EASE OF USE: It was a real grapple with the grip combs, they reminded me of those arcade games where you try to grab a toy with a giant claw. The flex is very short so you have to sit next to a plug point while they heat up, which is irritating.  

RESULT: I do like the effects. My hair is big and bouncy with some strong, springy curls pooling on my shoulders.

BEST FOR: Those with lots of power points. 3/5

Well these are very pretty to look at, see below, - two large, two medium and six small black and pink Velcro rollers in a rather fetching pink case. You know they've heated up when a dot on the rim of the rollers turns from green to dark grey - not an easy colour change to spot.

During and after: Mark Hill's rollers are a pain to use but delivered some nicely flicked out waves

EASE OF USE: These take six minutes to cook and the thick bristles feel like rolling a loo brush in your hair. I also struggled threading the pin through the rim of the rollers.

RESULTS: Delivered some nicely flicked out waves - think Pamela Anderson in Baywatch. The curls passed the tug-them-and-see-if-they-fall-out test. But they were such a pain to use.

BEST FOR: Those with manual dexterity. 2/5

The purse-aching price of a budget airline ticket to the Cannes Film Festival, this set is high-tech - the soft-grip rollers heat from cold to 130C in four seconds, while remaining cool to the touch. Only the core of the roller is heated, rather than the surface. An electronic beep and light alert you when each roller is ready.

EASE OF USE: The problem with pod rollers is that you can't get into a rhythm. You have to keep stopping and starting to heat each one.

RESULTS: I love the overall effect - a head of loose waves, which kink and curl rather fetchingly around the shoulders - very Kate Middleton.

BEST FOR: Lottery winners and Duchesses. 4/5

Compared to modern rollers, Mum's old ones are like an instrument of torture. With their spikes and surgical-style pins, I'm tempted to take a paracetamol to ease the pain of putting them in.

Touchingly dated: They took a long time to heat up, but Mum's old rollers produced a nice ringlet effect

EASE OF USE: Heated up on vertical posts within a compact case, they took an hour - yes, a whole hour - to warm up. Though you do get a lot of rollers for your money: six big ones, ten medium sized and four small. The biggest were only the same size as the medium rollers in most of the modern sets.

RESULT: Actually, the effect was really nice and touchingly dated since with so many smaller rollers it produced quite a ringlet effect that brushed out into beautiful waves. But they needed at least 40 minutes to produce a curl. My mum always liked it when I had curly hair - she railed against the fact I blow-dried it straight. So I hope this would have made her happy.

BEST FOR: An afternoon of nostalgia. 3/5
