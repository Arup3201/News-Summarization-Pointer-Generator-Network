It is just day since apple revealed its new iPhone 6, which doesn't even go on sale until Friday.

However, the firm is already hard at work on its next launch.

It is claimed Apple will unveil two new iPads and a radical overhaul of its Mac software next month on October 21st.

Apple will unveil two new iPads and a radical overhaul of its Mac software next month on October 21st, it has been claimed.

The iPad is expected to have a 9.7 inch screen, while the
new version of the iPad mini will have a 7.9 inch screen,
Bloomberg earlier reported, citing people familiar with the
matter.

The iPads are expected to have a thinner, curved design similar to the new iPhone 6, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

Apple is also believed to be working on a larger 'iPad Plus' for release next year with a 12.9inch screen. 

The iPads are expected to have a thinner, curved design similar to the new iPhone 6, and a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

However, opinion is divided over the claims.

The Daily Dot report cities 'sources familiar with the matter'.

However, blogger Jim Dalrymple, known for his knowledge of all things Apple, pointed out the link and simply said 'nope' on his blog. 

The company plans to unveil the sixth generation of its iPad
and the third edition of the iPad mini, as well as its operating
system OS X Yosemite, which has undergone a complete visual
overhaul, the Internet news website said.

Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple, declined to comment.

new version of the iPad mini will have a 7.9 inch screen,

matter.

The rumours come just days after Apple revealed the iPhone 6 and the Apple watch, pictured.

A Bloomberg report said the Cupertino, California-based
company will launch its next generation of iPads around
mid-October as Apple prepares for the holiday season by boosting
its product lineup.

Apple sold 13.3 million iPads in the quarter ended June,
falling short of analysts' projections for more than 14 million.

Apple also unveiled its Apple Watch, two larger iPhones and
a mobile payments service dubbed 'Apple Pay' last week.
