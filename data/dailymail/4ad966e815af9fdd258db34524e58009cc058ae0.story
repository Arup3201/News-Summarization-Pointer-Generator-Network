Cliff Richard lashed out at police  for apparently leaking news of the highly-controversial search of his home to the BBC.

A phalanx of journalists from the national broadcaster were waiting for officers as they arrived at his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire.

They were in position to film the motorcade as it swung through the gates both from the roadside and a helicopter hovering overhead.

Anger: Cliff Richard, pictured in Portugal on Sunday, lashed out at police yesterday for apparently leaking news of the highly-controversial search of his home to the BBC

At 1pm, the BBC launched a broadside of pre-prepared reports across its network, on TV, radio the internet and via numerous social networking accounts.

Its coverage included a pre-recorded interview with a uniformed senior officer standing outside the Sheffield headquarters of South Yorkshire Police.

The avalanche of publicity sent shockwaves around the world and clearly surprised Sir Cliff, who is currently staying in Portugal.

In an indignant statement released several hours later, in which he vehemently protested his innocence, he also revealed his anger over the wall-to-wall live coverage.

He said: ‘ ... the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.’

The BBC was well prepared for the arrival of eight officers at Sir Cliff’s penthouse flat yesterday morning.

The team of plain-clothes detectives were filmed walking into the complex and even donning blue latex gloves as they searched a desk in his home.

A helicopter chartered by the BBC hovered above the scene for several hours, filming officers as they carried materials outside.

The news was broadcast simultaneously across the BBC network and tweeted by a handful of journalists and producers near Sir Cliff’s home.

Before the bombshell exploded, one regional radio presenter commented: ‘Watch the news at 1pm please. Or listen to the radio. Any channel.’

One reason the access is so controversial is the furious reaction in some quarters to the presence of a tabloid photographer at the arrest of Harry Redknapp.

The Sun was pilloried by the liberal media after it caught the football manager being driven from his home in 2007 over corruption allegations.

Redknapp was acquitted and later sued City of London police and spoke of his ‘bitter disappointment’ at the way the raid and his arrest were handled.

A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman strongly denied that the force officially passed any information about the search to the broadcaster.

She said: ‘The BBC had their own source and the information categorically did not come from South Yorkshire Police.

‘The BBC were the first to request an interview with a senior officer and all subsequent media requests were accommodated.’

A BBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the source of their story.

The Rev Richard Coles, a regular on BBC Radio 4, criticised the broadcaster’s coverage.

He said: ‘What an amazing coincidence that the news media had cameras outside Sir Cliff Richard’s house and in a helicopter when the cops arrived.’
