Protestors in the Ukraine have installed a golden toilet on a plinth that was once the home of a statue of former Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin.

A student group in Kiev placed the toilet there as a scathing commentary on allegations of corruption among government ministers.

Among the accusations against Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych that have fueled the demonstrations is the charge that he had gold toilets installed at his sprawling country estate near Kiev.

Rage: The statue was torn down in protest at closer ties to Moscow

Earlier, Ukrainian activists targeted the Kiev offices of Germany's Deutsche Bank, claiming that it was handling corruption money from President Viktor Yanukovych's inner circle.

Protestors are angry that the government has moved away from a closer relationship with the EU to develop stronger ties with Russia.

The statue was torn down as a gesture rejecting Moscow's historic influence over Ukraine.

Ukrainian opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, after meeting with the country's beleaguered president, is warning that tempers are heating up and says the president must take action to resolve the country's political crisis.

The former boxer's meeting on Tuesday with President Viktor Yanukovych came as parliament held a session that took no action.

Two months of protests have put Yanukovych under substantial pressure. But he has made no moves to work with the opposition since last week, when he pushed parliament to pass a measure providing amnesty to many arrested protesters if demonstrators vacate buildings they occupy.

Protesters rejected that condition and continue to seek Yanukovych's resignation and early elections.

After the meeting, Klitschko said: 'The temperature of society is growing and I told the president we have to immediately take a decision.'

Meanwhile, the leader of a main anti-government group in Ukraine fled to the UK after a warrant was issued for his arrest in Kiev.

Oleksandr Danylyuk, 39, leads Spilna Sprava is wanted by the Ministry of Interior for provoking mass anti-government protests, an offence punishable by 15 years in jail.

Danylyuk's personal Facebook page states he is now in London with his wife and children having crossed the border 'by foot' on January 28.

A source close to the activist said: 'He has good connections in London and a lot of friends there, but his reasons for coming are political and not related to business.

'It is quite possible that Zhena 
Tymoshenko [daughter of Yulia Tymoshenko] helped organise his family's 
move, since Spilna Sprava have connections with this camp.'

Zhena Tymoshenko's spokesperson denied there are any ties.

Writing on his Facebook page, Danylyuk said he had little faith in the so-called amnesty being offered by the government.

'This will not protect anyone from further repression, especially as the kidnapping and murder of activists are extralegal acts.

'We are confronted with maniac serial killers with whom it is impossible to find a compromise," he said.

Danylyuk also wrote on the social networking site that he plans to continue his activism from the UK.
