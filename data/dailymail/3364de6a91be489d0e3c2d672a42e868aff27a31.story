Lamar Hawkins, 14, was found dead with a bullet wound to his head at Seminole County school 

The family of a 14-year-old boy who shot himself dead in a school bathroom have claimed he endured years of bullying at school. 

Lamar Hawkins III was found dead with a bullet wound to his head at a Seminole County middle school on September 11, just hours after being reported missing by his mother.

Today at a news conference his mother, Shaniqua Hawkins, fought back tears and said she felt powerless to help her son against the bullies.

'It was a feeling I hope no other parent has to fear,' she said.

'They won, because he took his life as a result,' she said reported the Orlando Sentinel. 

'We called him Shaq because despite his size, he had a larger than life personality and attitude towards life,' said Shaniqua Hawkins, Lamar's mother.

'Shaq was physically and emotionally abused while at school. Many students would be just down right cruel to him,' she said reported WFTV. 

She claimed he was pushed down the stairs, knocked out of his chair and mocked at lunch.

'The child was a relatively small child for his age due to complications early in life,' attorney Matt Morgan said Friday. 

'As a result, he became a very easy target for mean-spirited bullies.

According to Seminole County Sheriff's Office, Lamar's mother drove to Greenwood Lakes Middle School in Lake Mary to pick up her son at around 5pm, but could not find him.

The boy's family then set out scouring the neighborhood for him, but to no avail.

Two hours later, the 14-year-old was reported missing to police. 

Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to Greenwood Lakes Middle School to search the campus, where they eventually came upon the missing boy, who was found in a men's room stall with a bullet wound to the head. 

Police said Lamar shot himself with a gun that belonged to his father, Lamar Hawkins Sr., 34.

'We are still investigating the facts leading up to this tragedy and I can tell you that Mr. Hawkins' firearm was stored with full compliance of Florida law,' said Matt Morgan, attorney for the Hawkins family.

Police are still investigating how he managed to get hold of the gun.  No charges have been announced.

The suicide prompted hundreds of mourners to gather for a vigil across the street from the Lake Mary school late Friday.

Last week Matt Morgan told Wesh.com: 'We believe this child was bullied, literally to his death.

Friends and family gather to pay their respects to the teenager who was allegedly bullied 

'He was tortured by mean-spirited children at his school and ultimately took his own life as a result,' said Matt Morgan, of Morgan and Morgan Law Firm.

'It was physical, it was mental, it was emotional. It was repeated attacks by individuals at this school that ultimately led him to make the final decision to end his life,' he said. 

He said that the family even moved from New York to Florida to help their son, but his call for help allegedly went largely ignored.

One student told the Orlando Sentinel: 'This one girl was beating him up since sixth grade and he was in eighth grade and no one knew it really bothered him.'

Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Cannaday told the Orlando Sentinel that investigators are still trying to determine why the boy killed himself and whether bullying was a factor.

'It's really unclear whether that played a role in this,' Cannaday said. 'We're still trying to determine the events that led up to this tragedy.'

Also at today's news conference was Tricia Norman, whose 12-year-old daughter, Rebecca Sedwick, (both pictured) jumped to her death in September 2013 after months of alleged cyber-bullying
