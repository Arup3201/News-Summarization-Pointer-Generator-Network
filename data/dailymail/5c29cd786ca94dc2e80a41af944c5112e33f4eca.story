Democratic lawmakers amped up their criticisms of President Barack Obama this week, openly expressing irritation with the president's leadership style and his tendency to hold members of his own political party at arm's length.

Multiple Democratic senators told the New York Times that they not only lack a personal relationship with the president, who was once a senator himself, they've rarely had the opportunity to talk to him one on one throughout the course of his presidency.

Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, now in her second term, summed up the president's attitude toward his former colleagues this way: 'For him, eating his spinach is schmoozing with elected officials.

'This is not something that he loves. He wasn’t that kind of senator.'

Loner: Democratic lawmakers are irked that President Barack Obama doesn't work more closely with them

Republicans inside and outside of Congress have expressed annoyance with Obama throughout his second term over what they perceive as a disinterest in governing and the politicking that goes with it.

But the president's political allies have also begun coming forward with their own lists of grievances toward Obama, some of which sound similar to their counterparts across the aisle.

'Talented guy but no leader,' a former member of Congress who is now a lobbyist told the National Journal's Ron Fournier a couple month's ago.

'If he could govern half as well as he campaigns, he'd be a good-to-great president,' the former lawmaker said.

'He's bored and tired of being president,' a current Democratic lawmaker told Fournier.

On several occasions in recent months the president has made major policy decisions without consulting Congress, and, more importantly to Democrats, his party's leadership.

The most egregious example dates back to late May, when Obama secretly swapped five Taliban commanders being held at Guantanamo Bay for the safe return of Bowe Bergdahl, an Army private who was abducted by the Taliban five years ago in Afghanistan.

The White House is legally required to inform Congress 30 before it releases prisoners from Gitmo of its intentions. The Obama administration ignored the law to make the Bergdahl trade, however, and notified members hours beforehand or not at all.

'Even I have had enough,' a powerful Democrat in Washington told Fournier after the terror trade.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva, leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told The Hill last week that Obama's penchant for acting alone has become a source of irritation for Democrats.

'Not being consulted ahead of time — that just makes people crazy,' the Arizona congressman said.

'Let us know ahead of time. Call us in when you're developing something so we can give you our ground-level reality check about how this is going to work.'

The previous Sunday President Obama played with businessman Glen Hutchins. As of this week, Obama has played 189 games of golf. And only twice has he played with lawmakers

Obama's behavior is baffling, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly told The Hill.

'It's hard for us to fathom; I mean, is it just lack of full staffing and resources? [Is it] professional commitment? Is it a disdain for the legislative branch? I mean, what is it?' Connolly wondered.

'People like me want to be allies — I mean, I am an ally,' he continued. 'So work with us, reach out to us; you know, we're not the enemy.'

Obama may not view Congress as the 'enemy,' but he certainly doesn't view most members of the legislative body as his friends.

The 
president rarely takes lawmakers on his golfing trips or invites
 them over to the White House outside of big group events.

Obama has only golfed with lawmakers twice in the 189 times he's been on the course since taking office and only one of those times did he bring a Democrat - Sen. Mark Udall, Golf Digest's top-ranked golfer in Congress in 2011.

'The White House has something in common with the rest of America, and that is disdain for Congress,' McCaskill said. 'It is hard to blame them.'

The White House says the president has had Democrats over to the White House for meetings 18 times this year, but Richard Blumenthal, a Senator from Connecticut who was elected in 2010, told the Times that he 'can count them on both hands' the number of times he has been to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since he moved to Washington.

And all of those visits were for formal events, he said.'It’s more the interaction that I think has been somewhat lacking — the personal,' he noted.

Asked by the Times to describe his relationship with Obama, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said: 'It’s fairly nonexistent. There’s not much of a relationship.

'Maybe we wanted something different,' Manchin said of his party's expectations of Obama. 'But it kind of is what it is.'

Virginia Rep. Jim Moran tried to explain Democratic lawmakers' frustrations with Obama in terms of football.

'Certainly, [former Democratic president] Bill Clinton saw us as his offensive line, and so he attended to the nurturing of his offensive line,' Moran told the Hill. 'And I don't think this president, this quarterback, invests all that much time and effort into the care and feeding of his offensive line.

You can still win,' Moran pointed out. 'It just makes it a little more difficult.'

'In order to work with people, you need to establish the relationship first before you ask for something,' Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats told the Times.

'And I think one of the things the White House has not done well and the president has not done well is the simple idea of establishing relationships before there is a crisis.'

Manchin said the White House may want to rethink its strategy for dealing with lawmakers moving forward if the president wants to accomplish more items on his legislative agenda.

'Maybe if something isn’t working, you’d say, "What can I do better?" ' the Democratic Senator said.
