Murdered: One of the victims was Sakine Cansiz, co-founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party

The founder of a Turkish militant group has been found shot dead alongside two other female activists in what is believed to be a 'politically motivated execution.'

The body of Sakine Cansiz was discovered alongside Fidan Dogan, 32 and Leyla Soylemez at the Paris headquarters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.

The women were all members of the group - known by the initials PKK - which campaigns for an independent Kurdish nation free from Turkey.

The grim discovery was made last night in the 10th arrondissement of the French capital.

Angry protesters gathered outside the building chanting anti-Turkish slogans this morning as the corpses was carried out and riot police had to be deployed.

The women had been working together on Wednesday but the institute had been closed from midday.

A partner of one of the victims raised the alarm when she did not return his calls.

‘The
scene points to an assassination, but an investigation is being carried out to
establish exactly what happened,’ said a police source at the scene.
