Edward Lewis, 72, who has dementia, went missing from Morriston Hospital in Swansea on Monday

An NHS patient who went missing from his hospital bed was found wandering around two miles away still attached to his heart monitor sensors.

Edward Lewis, 72, who has dementia, was discovered trying to sell his wristwatch in a petrol station for the money to get home.

The heart patient climbed out of his bed, changed his clothes, and walked out of the ward on Monday.

His family claim nurses had failed to notice he had disappeared.

His granddaughter and official carer Kelly Morris, 35, said: ‘He put on his clothes and walked out of the hospital and caught a bus.

‘He walked around for around an hour and didn’t know where he was.

‘He was asking people to buy his watch at a Tesco garage - he was trying to sell it to get home.

‘A couple spotted him trying to get across the dual carriageway. They called us as our phone number is in his wallet.

‘The hospital staff hadn’t notified us that he had gone missing.’

Mr Lewis was being treated for a low heart rate at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, South Wales, when he disappeared.

Mrs Morris said: ‘His heart rate is 52 when it is meant to be 62. When he left the hospital on Monday he still had his heart monitor on.’

Mr Lewis was being cared for by family at his home in Port Talbot, near Swansea, yesterday.

The Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board which runs the hospital yesterday apologised to Mr Lewis and his family.

Mr Lewis (pictured with his daughter, Christine Robinson, and his granddaughter, Kelly Morris) was found wandering around two miles away from the hospital and still attached to his heart monitor sensors

When he was found, he was at a petrol station trying to sell his wristwatch to raise enough money to get home

A spokeswoman said Mr Lewis’s disappearance was being fully investigated but denied the family’s claims that staff had not noticed he had gone.

She said: ‘The health board and staff on the ward offer their sincere apologies to the patient and his family.

‘We are currently in the process of investigating what happened.

Mr Lewis's family claim that the nurses on his ward at Morriston Hospital did not notice that he was missing and that they only found out when the family called in to say that he had been found

Morriston Hospital says that it is carrying out an investigation into what happened but it claims that nurses quickly noticed that Mr Lewis was missing and started to look for him

‘Patients are checked on an hourly basis and it was at one of these checks it was noticed the patient was missing.

‘All staff and security were immediately informed and began looking for the patient.

‘Staff were in the process of alerting the family when the family themselves phoned within a short time of the patient being discovered missing.'
