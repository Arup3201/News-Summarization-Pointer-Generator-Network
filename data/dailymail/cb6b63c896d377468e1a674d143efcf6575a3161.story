No, he didn't squeal like a girl. And unless you're a cricket supremo, don't diss his tattoo. 

When legendary cricketer Kevin Pietersen revealed his latest piece of body art overnight - a huge world map stretching from his chest to his back - some punters were quick to sledge his selection.

England's Daily Express branded it 'shocking', TVNZ 'bizarre' and a BBC sportscaster simply described it as 'astonishing'.

But Pietersen's acclaimed tattoo artist, Melbourne's Mick Squires, has now come out swinging in defence of his client's choice in an interview with Daily Mail Australia. 

'It's his tattoo. At the end of the day if you can go and score as many centuries as he has and be able to and be able to put them on a world map then you've got something to say.' 

'But if you can't, you should shut your mouth,' he said with a laugh.

'A little nervous': Cricketer Kevin Pietersen, pictured being inked with his world map tattoo by Mick Squires, did not squeal or move during the tattooing on Wednesday

Hailed the 'Wizard of Oz' by Tattoo Master magazine, Squires, 30 - who has a waiting list six months long - is highly regarded in the  tattoo artist community.

The one-time IT worker, who said he 'never would have thought' his career would make such a drastic change, is the co-owner of Behind Closed Doors. 

It's a high-end private clinic in Northcote, north-east of Melbourne's CBD. It is a far cry from tattoo parlours where customers drunkenly stumble into at 4am to get inked with Chinese characters.

Squires, who has travelled the world to teach his art and appeared at conventions in Berlin and London, is known for his breathtakingly detailed hyper-realistic portrait designs.

Using relatively rare techniques, some of his stand-outs include his artwork of Breaking Bad character Walter White, pop star Rihanna with a snake biting her nose and Star Wars mainstays Darth Vader and Boba Fett.

Squires has inked several sports stars. But as a 'massive cricket fan' planning to head to the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) next week, he said Pietersen's visit on Wednesday was a highlight.

Pietersen's wanted a world map with red stars highlighting each place where he had scored 32 centuries over a career spanning nine years. 

Each mark represents a place that Pietersen has scored an international century for England - be it Test or ODI - including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Pakistan and Australia.  

The work took around an hour-and-a-half on Wednesday, Squires told Daily Mail Australia. The heavily-inked cricketer - known for his very patriotic Three Lions tat - was a little nervous.

'You know what he actually was quite good in getting tattoos,' Squires said. 'There was no squealing, no moving, nothing like that. He was pretty good. 

'He was actually quite nervous but apart from that he wasn't too girly or anything.' 

Squires described Pietersen as a 'top bloke'. 

The batsman is currently plying his trade in the Big Bash League for Melbourne Stars. 

He is averaging 39 runs across five innings in the Big Bash for the Stars, who sit fourth of eight in the standings. 

Previous works: The batsman is well-known for his tattoos; on his bicep he marks the first three of his four Ashes victories

Finished product: Squires is well respected in the tattoo artist community, dubbed the 'Wizard of Oz' by one industry magazine
