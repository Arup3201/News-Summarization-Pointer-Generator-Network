A Victorian church where Sherlock Homes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tried to contact the dead has gone up for sale.

The Cedars Spiritualist Church in Ipswich, Suffolk - once a hotbed of British spiritualism - is on the market for between £500,000 and £700,000.

In the 1920s it hosted packed meetings where psychics would try to contact the spirits of people who had passed on.

Spiritualist: One regular visitor to the church was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was one of the most famous spiritualists of his day

One regular visitor was writer Doyle who was one of the most famous spiritualists of his day, finding solace in the practice after losing his wife Louise in 1906 and his son Kingsley just before the end of the First World War. 

Records show that Ipswich Psychic Society - as the church was once known - hosted popular garden parties and talks that attracted as many as 1,000 people.

Kandi Munson, The Cedars' president, said the imposing Victorian property was originally bought for £800.

On the move: Church leaders have taken the decision to sell up as they want a property more suited to what the church now offers, including activities such as yoga and meditation, as well as regular services

She added: 'We had our own mediums, Joan Brown and Dorothy Abraham, who lived here in the flats above the church for many years.

'They talked about people arriving in horse and carriages from London, visits from and to Native Indians in Canada and, of course, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who came to society meetings on a number of occasions.

'We've got all his books on spiritualism - all first editions which he gave us. They are locked away but they won't be sold as part of the house.

Creation: Conan Doyle was the man behind the famed literary detective Sherlock Holmes, played in the BBC series Sherlock by Benedict Cumberbatch

'They are too precious and will be coming with us to our new home.'

Church leaders have taken the decision to sell up as they want a property more suited to what the church now offers, including activities such as yoga and meditation, as well as regular services.

Auctioneer Tim Golding said: 'It's a special property and not just because of its history.'

The Cedars will be going under the hammer at Goldings Auctions at Wherstead Park next month.

Beliefs: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle found solace in spirituality and the belief in being able to contact the dead after sinking into depression following the deaths of his wife Louisa and son Kingsley, as well as his brother and other relatives.

Kingsley Doyle had died in October 1918, just before the end of the First World War, after contracting pneumonia while recovering from an injury inflicted during the Battle of the Somme.

The year after his youngest son's death Doyle attended a sitting with a Welsh medium in which he claimed Kingsley had spoke to him, and that he had also seen his mother and nephew.

He became a leading voice in the spiritualist movement, even writing a Professor Challenger novel The Land Of Mist on the subject, while his 1922 book The Coming Of The Fairies revealed he was apparently convinced that the Cottingley Fairies photographs were real.

Doyle's staunch belief in spiritualism even brought about the end of his friendship with magician Harry Houdini, who began to speak out against spiritualism after the death of his mother.

Houdini insisted that mediums used trickery and illusions to fool grieving relatives, but was unable to convince Doyle this was the case.

Just after the author's death in July 1930 at the age of 71, a spiritualist meeting was organised at the Royal Albert Hall to enable Conan Doyle to make one final appearance.

Thousands of people attended including his second wife Jean and some of his children, and even though the author did not appear, some in the audience claimed they had felt his presence.
