An engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were 'an inconvenience to carry' has come up with a solution - the folding helmet.

Philippe Arrouart carried out his own study as to why urban cyclists and commuters felt the need to ditch helmets while cycling in cities.

And his solution, the Plixi helmet, neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags.

A Paris-based inventor has designed a portable bike helmet (shown). Called Plixi the £60 ($95) product folds to a third of its size. It has a number of segments and hinges that let it be stored more easily. It also meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists to BMX riders

The Plixi helmet, which costs about £79 ($126), was made by engineer Mr Arrouart, 40, from Paris, France.

He began his study when he noticed increasing numbers of people were using the Velib bike sharing system in Paris - similar to the Boris Bikes in London.

But he felt people were not sufficiently protecting themselves without a helmet.

Volume is divided by 3 when folded.

Size of the helmet when folded: 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches (21 x 11 x 16 cm).

Weight: 490g (one pound).

Outer shell is made of ABS plastic - inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene.

The helmet has 14 vents. 

Sold with inner fitting pads of various thicknesses to adjust the comfort of the helmet

Adjustable straps with chin protection 

'Many people immediately used those bikes to commute when Velib came in,' he said.

'Drivers were not used to them and people started to say "it is dangerous, we'll have many accidents".

'I wondered why those people were not protecting themselves with a bike helmet.

'I asked urban cyclists why they didn't wear a helmet and the number one answer was the inconvenience of carrying your helmet with you when you're not on the bike.

'The other main reason was the look and style you have when wearing a bike helmet.

'So I got the idea to create a folding bike helmet which is much easier to carry and store while also being chic and trendy.'

 

The helmet meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists, BMX riders and other people on a bike. The product is available in black or white (shown) and will come in two sizes

The Plixi helmet, which costs about £79 ($126), was made by engineer Philippe Arrouart, 40, from Paris, France. He began his study when he noticed more and more people were starting to use the Velib bike sharing system in Paris - like Boris Bikes in London

He created the company Overade in December 2010 and began making prototypes, involving designers to improve its look and style.

The result is a helmet which takes no longer than two or three seconds to stow away in a bag.

It currently is available in one size, large/extra-large, which measures 23.2 to 24.4 inches (59 to 62 cm), although a smaller version is planned. 

The helmets are also open to customisation, with add-ons like covers and visors, and come in a range of colours.

Plixi answers European certification on bike helmets, meaning that despite targeting commuters and urban cyclists, it can be used by road racers and BMX riders as well.

Business partner Clement Cailleau, 31, added: 'People who have seen it really like the finishing quality of the product.

'They enjoy manipulating the Plixi and agree it is easy and simple to use. They realise in their everyday life that it truly brings a real value added.'
