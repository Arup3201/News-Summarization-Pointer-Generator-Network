After four years, over $1 million in medical costs and dozens of blood transfusions and skin grafts, a Michigan woman says she has recovered from not only one but two rare spider bites that nearly cost her her leg.

Bedridden and warned of potentially losing her leg, Jane Hefferan of Dearborn, Michigan said she would have never guessed that a single spider bite would end the way it did, but neither did her doctors.

'It was eating up so much of my leg, and so much of my tissue was gone,' Ms Hefferan who had just graduated from Vanderbilt University when first bitten told Click on Detroit. 'At that point there was like nothing left of my leg. It was just basically bone.'

Mending: Jane Hefferan is seen during her recovery after a brown recluse spider bit her leg requiring over 20 surgeries that cut dead tissue away straight to the bone

It was in the summer of 2008 after graduating from law school that doctors believe a poisonous brown recluse spider crawled into her bed in Nashville - how experts say 38 per cent of brown recluse bites occur.

Primarily known throughout parts of the southeast, though capable of spreading elsewhere, the spider's bite immediately puffed up her knee but she shoved it off as related to a previous running injury than something far more serious.

It was her physical therapist who realized it was something more.

'The physical therapist looked at it and he's like, "You need to go to the emergency room,' she said.

'I immediately said that no, it wasn't a spider bite. It couldn't possibly be. I had no idea that a spider could do something like that,' she said.

Double trouble: Adding to her horrific fight, just after beginning treatment on her knee doctors discovered a second, newly sustained bite on her other leg

Before what would accumulate to over 20 
surgeries, over 50 units of blood transfusions and multiple skin grafts,
 Ms Hefferan spent her first day in surgery, stripping the first layers 
of dead tissue from her knee.

'The
 initial surgery was just to cut out all of the necrotic or dead tissue 
that the spider had destroyed,' Ms Hefferan said. 'It was on the side of
 my knee. They cut down basically to the lining of the bone.'

What could only make matters worse, however, was news of a second bite found during her 
recovery on her other leg, 
adding to her student health insurance running out a month after the first treatment.

Working in overdrive, doctors said the bites triggered an auto-immune disease called pyoderma gangrenosum, according to the Dearborn Free Press, that caused large, painful sores that weren't healing.

'It kept opening up, and I was having a lot of bleeding. The graft wasn't taking. They ended up doing another graft which didn't take. And then they ended up doing a third graft, at which point they kept me in the hospital on complete bed rest,' she said.

'Something so small, something that I could have stepped on and killed, could cause all of this,' she said this week of her disbelief.

As the law school graduate documented 
her recovery on her Facebook page, showing her painful skin graphs and 
the large amount of blood loss sustained from her open wounds, she 
reached out to friends and her community for help.

She asked that anyone who could donate blood would.

'...its [sic] sad that I had never 
donated blood until now. But from now on, I will donate as often as I 
can!' a friend of hers wrote on her Facebook page showing a photo of a 
red wristband printed ‘For Jane.’

Further coming to her aid, with some of 
her hospital stays costing she said around $300,000-400,000, friends in 
Dearborn held fundraisers and blood drives in her name and Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center provided her with several months of charitable
 treatment.

Inspired: Despite having passed her bar exam following graduation, Ms Hefferan says her experience has inspired her to go back to school for nursing

'After over 1300+ days my knee is finally healed!!! Too bad I think my days as a leg model might be over,' she posted with a picture of her knee late last month.

And throughout all of her work toward recovery coupled with studying, Ms Hefferan said she passed the bar exam.

On to bigger and better things, Ms Hefferan said that despite her academic accomplishments, her experience has inspired her to change career paths.

'I'm now going back to school and hope to start a nursing program next fall,' she told Click on Detroit.

While her injuries sustained by the bites were deemed unusually severe by her doctors - with 90 per cent of brown recluse bites healing on their own and only 3 per cent requiring skin grafts, according to a University of California, Riverside researcher speaking to ABC - she hopes to use her experience as a patient advocate after receiving a nursing degree.

Until then, she's busy warning others as a model to immediately seek treatment if a bite is suspected.
