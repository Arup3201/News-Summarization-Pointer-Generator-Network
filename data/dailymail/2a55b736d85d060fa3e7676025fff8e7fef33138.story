Russell Slade has been appointed Cardiff City manager, the Welsh club confirmed on Monday - and  owner Vincent Tan couldn't resist taking another swipe at disgraced former boss Malky Mackay.

Slade resigned as Leyton Orient manager last month but the East London club and the Bluebirds had been in a dispute over Slade joining Cardiff to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who departed in mid-September.

The matter has now been resolved and  Tan said of his new gaffer: 'I'm delighted to appoint Russell Slade as the Manager of Cardiff City. I have personally offered Russell this opportunity after giving much thought to the needs of the Club at this point in time and firmly believe that he is the right person for the job.

Slade has already been working at Cardiff as a football consultant and was in the stands for the Bluebirds' 1-0 defeat by Blackpool on Friday  

'I have spoken to many knowledgeable people in the game about Russell, and the feedback has been extremely positive.' 

Tan then took a pop at former boss Malky Mackay, and said: 'He [Slade] certainly deserves to be given a chance. After all, Cardiff gave a chance to a mediocre manager from Watford and he took the club to the Premier League. I did however give him a lot of money to spend for that – in fact, too much money.'

Slade, who has been working with Cardiff as a consultant since leaving Orient, said, 'I'm grateful to Vincent for giving me this opportunity as Cardiff City is a fantastic Football Club. We have a large squad and it's more than putting out the best eleven players on paper. We need the best group of players out there with the right balance and chemistry. 

Cardiff owner Vincent Tan said he is convinced Slade is the right man to take the club forward 

'It's now about building a relationship with the players and installing a strong ethos and work ethic. That's what I want us to take onto the pitch every week.' 

The 53-year-old traveled with the Cardiff squad for the 1-0 defeat by Blackpool and watched the game from the stands, and will now take over from Scott Young and Danny Gabbidon, who had been in caretaker charge since Solskjaer's departure.

Slade led Leyton Orient to the League One play-offs last season but resigned as manager in September 

The former Notts County and Yeovil manager was also in the stands to watch Cardiff's 2-1 win against Sheffield Wednesday and the 1-1 draw at Brighton. 

Club owner Tan said last week he hopes Slade can stay at the club for even longer than Arsene Wenger's 18-year stint at Arsenal.
