Going food shopping with your mother was only ever truly fun if you could ride along in the cart, and the animal kingdom is no different as these anteaters show.

The exhausted baby giant anteater ensured it got a much-needed piggyback from its mother as the hunt for food gets all too much.

The peculiar little animal slumped onto its mother to hitch a ride as she dug through the earth in search of ants and termites for dinner.

Hurry up mum: Tired of hunting for food, the baby anteater has climbed up onto the back of its mother

Can we go home now? The strange-looking animals were photographed  in the Pantanal wetlands in Brazil

Grand moves: The giant anteater is also known as the ant bear due to its large size and can be found across central South America

Young anteaters often travel on their 
mothers’ backs, using their large claws to climb up their parents' thick
 fur where they are cleverly camouflaged from predators.

The one-foot-long baby was dwarfed by its mother, which measured around nine feet from nose to tail.

The pair were snapped by Mario Haberfeld in Pantanal, an area of wetlands in the mid-west of Brazil.

Mr
 Haberfeld, 37, a former racing driver who now runs a jaguar 
conservation project, was visiting the region with his son when they 
stumbled across the scene.

Dinner time: The giant anteater is an insectivore and uses its tongue to eat ants and termites

Are we there yet? A baby anteater normally stays with its mother until it is nine or ten months old, after which they wander off independently

Safe haven: Baby anteaters use their large claws to climb up their parents' thick fur and onto their backs where they are cleverly camouflaged from predators

He said: ‘I was in the Pantanal wetlands in mid-west Brazil working on my jaguar conservation project.

‘One day I was walking with my son Roberto and we came across a giant anteater with its baby on its back.

‘Giant anteaters have terrible eyesight and as long as you stay upwind of them you can get quite close to them.

‘We
 slowly walked over to the anteater until we were about six feet from 
it. They are very docile creatures and it just kept going about its 
business, looking for ants.'

Score: The mother dives down, nose first, after finding insects in a small bush on the Pantanal wetlands

Heading back: Having eaten, the mother looks to find a safe place where she in turn can feed her baby

He added: ‘Giant
 anteaters have very long nails and the adults have thick fur, so the 
baby had just clambered up onto its mum's back for a rest.

‘I
 have been going to the region for ten years and sights like this are 
not uncommon. It seems that as long as the babies are small enough, the 
mums are happy to have them on their backs.’

The giant anteater is also known as the ant bear due to its size and is the largest of the four species of anteaters.

They have one of the longest tongues per body size in the animal kingdom, measuring more than two feet long.

They are native to Central and South America and live in a range of different environments from grassland to rainforest.
