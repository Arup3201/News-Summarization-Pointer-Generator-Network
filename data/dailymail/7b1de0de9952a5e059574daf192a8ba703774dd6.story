Aston Villa midfielder Gary Gardner has signed a four-month loan deal with Brighton and could play against Swindon in the League Cup on Tuesday night.

The 22-year-old has endured two years of injuries to curtail his development but is so highly-regarded at Villa Park was given a two-year contract extension this summer taking him to June 2016.

But with the arrival of Colombian Carlos Sanchez, manager Paul Lambert has allowed Gardner to go on loan at Sami Hyypia’s Championship side until January to get regular action.

Gardner has been at Villa since he was 13 and progressed to make his debut aged 19 in a Premier League win at Chelsea in December 2011.

He has played just two games for the club in the past two seasons after suffering two serious knee injuries and went on loan at Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the last campaign, appearing four times.

Gardner has been capped by various England youth sides, including five appearances and two goals at Under-21 level, and joins Villa team-mate Joe Bennett on loan at Brighton.

In an interview with Sportsmail this summer, his brother Craig – now at West Brom – believes Gary has the opportunity to impress with injuries appearing to be behind him.

‘I’m his biggest fan,’ said Craig. ‘It shows how good he is when he’s been injured for two years and they give him another contract. This season is a big one for him.’
