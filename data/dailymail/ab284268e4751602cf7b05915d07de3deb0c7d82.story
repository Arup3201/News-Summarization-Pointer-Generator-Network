When the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis released of a list of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, victims' groups complained it was incomplete.

Harry Walsh wasn't on the list of 30 priests made public two weeks ago. But church documents obtained by Minnesota Public Radio show he had been accused in the 1990s of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul in the early 1980s.

The archdiocese contributed to a financial settlement for the girl in 1996. Nonetheless, two archbishops allowed him to continue working in parishes until the fall of 2011, MPR reported.

Accused: Harry Walsh, 79, is accused of molesting a 15-year-old girl in Detroit in the mid-1960s and a 12-year-old altar boy in South St. Paul, Minnesota, in the early 1980s

Archbishop John Nienstedt asked Pope Benedict last year to defrock Walsh after he learned of the abuse allegations from documents in church archives, as well as an old internal investigation that determined Walsh had an affair with a married parishioner at a church in Monticello. Walsh agreed to leave.

Walsh now teaches sex education to troubled teenagers and vulnerable adults in Wright County. He signed a two-year, $1,508-a-month contract this year, according to public records.

Claims: Walsh served at Holy Redeemer parish in Detroit from 1965 until 1967. In 1994, a woman reported that Walsh had sexually abused her there when she was a 15-year-old girl

He told the station he never sexually abused children.'I'd have been shocked if I was on the list because there's nothing credible about it,' Walsh told MPR.

'If I were hiding that, you wouldn't be in my house right now; I would have been very careful.'

In 1997, Walsh contributed to a book called 'How I Got into Sex', which drew on the experiences of 'sex therapists, educators, prostitutes, sex toy designers, sex surrogates, transsexuals, criminologists and clergy.'

In it he described a life of sexual repression, mostly at the boys boarding school he attended.

'Removed from all contact with  "members of the opposite sex," it soon became clear that the one remaining fortress of sexual expression that needed to be conquered and leveled was 'the solitary vice of self-abuse.'

He told how, soon after he became a priest, he showed his mother a picture when he was three years old. She was shocked, he wrote.

He went on: 'In the name of all the saints in Ireland, what was wrong with the photograph? Mother pointed at my crotch … Following the direction of my mother's extended forefinger, I noticed that the cotton suit was snug enough in the crotch area to reveal a tiny bulge where my three-year-old penis was located. That was Mother's problem.'

He wrote that she cut the photo in two and burned the bottom half. 'I stared in disbelief as the disintegrating picture of my young self, consumed, like Joan of Arc, in the flames of orthodoxy,' he wrote. 'I knew, at that point, that my sexual script had been written for me years before. My parents' horoscope read: This one shall be crotchless. This one shall be a priest.'

Walsh said he might have kissed the girl affectionately, but it wouldn't have been sexual. He denied the allegation about the boy, who reported it as an adult to the archdiocese in 1996, and said he had never heard of the accusation.

Archdiocese spokesman Jim Accurso failed to explain why Walsh wasn't on the public list of accused priests, nor
 would he say why Walsh was allowed to serve as a music minister at St. 
Henry's Catholic Church in Monticello until he retired from that post 
two years ago, MPR reported.

'These
 disclosures are intended to be ongoing,' the archdiocese said in a 
statement.

'We are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of clergy
 files and the list will be updated as additional announcements are 
made.'

Accurso did not immediately return a phone call from the Associated Press seeking comment on Thursday.

It
 could not be immediately determined if either instance of alleged abuse
 was ever reported to police.

South St. Paul and Detroit police 
officials said records were not immediately available, if they exist. 
MPR's report said there were no records of archdiocese officials 
notifying police about the allegations.

Jennifer
 Haselberger, a former top adviser to Nienstedt, said the church had a 
moral responsibility to disclose Walsh's alleged abuse, particularly 
because he now teaches children about sex.

No
 one told Wright County officials about the allegations, said Carol 
Schefers, the county's public health director, who signed Walsh's 
contract. She also said she didn't know what she would do with the 
information.

On Tuesday, 
Nienstedt said he has stepped aside from active ministry while police 
investigate an allegation that he touched a boy on the buttocks in 2009.
 The archbishop called the claim 'absolutely and entirely false.'
