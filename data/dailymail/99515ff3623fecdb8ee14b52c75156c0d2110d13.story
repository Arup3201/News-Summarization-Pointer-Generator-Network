Liverpool midfielder Suso has confirmed Porto's interest in signing him.

The 20-year-old is the subject of an offer which Liverpool are considering and has underlined his desire to play more regularly after a loan spell back in his native Spain with Almeria last season.

He said: 'My priority is to stay here [at Liverpool], but Porto is an excellent option if I leave Liverpool. I know there’s negotiations.

'Porto are the best club in Portugal and they have faith in their youngsters. They also have a coach I like working with [Julen Lopetegui].

'I will only renew with Liverpool if I’m guaranteed I’ll play regularly. The option is clear if I don’t renew: let me leave.

'I think Liverpool thinks the same. They won’t let me leave on a free in a year if I don’t renew. Let's see what happens.'

Meanwhile, Alberto Moreno's girlfriend, Lilia Granadilla, has posted pictures on her twitter account of herself and the Sevilla left-back enjoying a break in Spain as Liverpool's proposed move for the 21-year-old continues to stall.
