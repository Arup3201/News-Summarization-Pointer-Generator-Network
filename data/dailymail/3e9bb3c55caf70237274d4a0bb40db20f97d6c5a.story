In a move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal.

The
 department opened an investigation into Martin's death last year but 
stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed.

In
 a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of
 the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for 
the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence 
generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and 
testimony from the state trial.

The statement 
said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal prosecutors 
will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation.'

Outraged: NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous (center) has launched a petition to have federal civil rights charges brought against George Zimmerman by Attorney General Eric Holder

This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene.

Already,
 over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP 
has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the 
Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old 
Zimmerman.

In his first public statement since the verdict, President Barack 
Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman 
in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying 
his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem 
gun violence.

'We are a nation of laws and a jury has 
spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement.

'I 
now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two 
parents who lost their young son.'

Obama,
 who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added
 that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings.

'And 
in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even 
higher,' he said.

The president 
urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and compassion' 
in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused 
into curtailing gun violence.

'We 
should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun 
violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily 
basis,' he said.

'We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a 
society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.'

'That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin,' he added.

Support: Steve Cohen (D-TN) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) (right) both have come out in support of the NAACP's petition calling for federal charges against George Zimmerman

And on 
Sunday, Daryl Parks, an attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin was 
non-committal when asked if they supported the NAACP's call for 
Zimmerman to be prosecuted by the Justice Department.

When
 asked on 'Fox News Sunday' if Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy and 
mother, Sybrina Fulton, supported such a move, Parks seemed to defer.

'The
 beauty of our country is that we have several tiers of government, 
several aspects of laws and that different times different aspects 
apply,' said Parks.

'Different laws apply at different times, different places apply at different times. That would be a different arena.'

Both
 Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton chose not to be in the
 Seminole Circuit Court when the jurors announced their decision just 
before 10 p.m.

George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman.

NAACP President Benjamin Jealous was unequivocal in his response to the not-guilty decision by the Florida jury.

'We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,' NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement. 

Difficult Decision: U.S. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have a difficult decision to make with regards to George Zimmerman

'We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,' said Jealous.

Politicians such as Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y) and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson have all added their voices to the NAACP's position and demanded the administration review the case.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, called the verdict 'a sad day
 in the country' and 'a slap in the face to those that believe in 
justice in this country.'

'I think this is an atrocity,' Sharpton said. 'It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.'

Jesse Jackson called the verdict 'Old South justice.'

'I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,' Jackson said.

Jealous said Martin's family may bring a civil
 suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges must be filed 
because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case.

He
 told CNN the black community is upset with a situation in which 'our 
young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys. The robbers 
and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who think 
that they're keeping folks safer.'

Sharpton,
 who called the verdict 'a slap in the face to the American people,' 
cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by 
Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state 
criminal trial found the police officers not guilty.

Later, the Justice 
Department brought a federal case that resulted in the conviction of two
 officers.

However, after Zimmerman was found not guilty on second-degree and manslaughter charges by a Florida jury on Saturday, Attorney General Eric Holder has been left with a decision of massive implications.

The enormous pressure on Holder, the United States' first African-American attorney general will grow over the coming days - especially in light of previous statements made on the matter.

Earlier this year, the Department of Justice launched a review of the shooting and Holder went on record to say that he would take appropriate action if there was sufficient evidence of a civil rights crime.

'If we find evidence of a potential federal criminal civil rights crime, we will take appropriate action, and at every step, the facts and law will guide us forward,' said Holder in a speech in April to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network.

However, in remarks subsequent to that, Holder toned-down his comments, saying that the DOJ faces a 'very high barrier' to bring federal criminal charges.

Holder made personal remarks about the death of Trayvon Martin in April, saying 'as a parent I reacted to it.'

'This is a pain that no parent should have to endure. The notion of having to bury a child is something that is, I think in some ways for a parent, the ultimate pain,' said Holder.

Attorney General Eric Holder,The Department of Justice has closely monitored the State of Florida’s prosecution of the case against George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin murder since it began.

Today, with the acquittal of George Zimmerman, it is time for the Department of Justice to act.The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin.

We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.Please address the travesties of the tragic death of Trayvon Martin by acting today.Thank you

'The primary responsibility we have in the Justice Department is to support the state in its ongoing investigation, to do our own thorough and parallel investigation which we are in the process of doing and try to resolve this matter in as fair and complete a way and as quickly as we can.'

Federal Charges?: George Zimmerman leaves the courtroom at the end of the day during his trial in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida

Zimmerman, 29, maintains he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense, while the state argued that Zimmerman 'profiled' Martin and concluded he was a criminal.

For their part, the NAACP is trying to build a ground swell of support for its call for federal charges.

'The Department of Justice has closely monitored the State of Florida’s prosecution of the case against George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin murder since it began,' reads the petition.

'The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin.'

'We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.'
