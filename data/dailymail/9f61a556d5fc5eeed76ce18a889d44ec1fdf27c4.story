Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone could face an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office after he admitted paying a banker £27million to stay silent over the tycoon's complex financial affairs.

The billionaire admitted last week that he made the payment to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a banker at the centre of a huge fraud trial in Germany.

Although the tycoon has not been charged with any offence, his admission placed him at the heart of the corruption case.

Evidence: Bernie Ecclestone testifies  in a Munich courtroom last week in the trial against banker Gerhard Gribkowsky. The F1 boss admitted that he had paid the banker £27million

It also raised further questions about the business affairs of the flamboyant billionaire, which have always been shrouded in mystery.

It has now emerged that the Serious Fraud Office is looking closely at the case in Germany to decide if 81-year-old Mr Ecclestone needs to be investigated.

A spokesman for the SFO said today: 'The SFO is aware of the allegations against Mr Ecclestone and is liaising with the authorities in Germany to ascertain if there is a case in the UK to answer'.

The Attorney General Dominic Grieve confirmed the involvement of the SFO to his Labour counterpart Emily Thornberry.

The Financial Times said Ms Thornberry had earlier written to Mr Grieve saying the trial in Germany
 'raises questions relating to bribery, corruption and tax evasion that 
need to be investigated further by British authorities'.

Gribkowsky is charged with receiving corrupt payments, breaches of trust and tax evasion.

The case centres around the 2005 sale
 of F1 shares by Gribkowsky's former employer, the German bank BayernLB,
 to the London-based private equity group Citicorp Venture Capital, CVC.

Gribkowsky, who engineered the deal, 
was charged with fraud after he was found to have £27million in an 
Austrian bank account following the deal's completion.

Expensive: Bernie Ecclestone and daughter Petra. The tycoon admitted last week that he only found out her wedding cost him more than £12m after the big day

Prosecutors claim this money was 
given to him by Mr Ecclestone as a bribe for securing favourable terms 
for the F1 boss. Mr Ecclestone denies this.

As a result of the deal arranged by Gribkowsky, Mr Ecclestone was paid five per cent commission – or £27million.

But the F1 boss told a packed Munich courtroom last week that a payment of £27million he subsequently made to Gribkowsky was because he was being blackmailed.

Request: MP Emily Thornberry wrote to Attorney General Dominic Grieve to say the trial in Germany which featured Bernie Ecclestone raised questions which need to be investigated

Mr Ecclestone claimed that Gribkowsky was 
threatening to make false accusations to the Inland Revenue about his 
tax affairs which would cost him 'billions' even though he was innocent.

Mr Ecclestone said he paid the banker the money not to do 'silly things'. He told the court: 'I really did not have any alternative.

'I was under the impression he might have given some information to the Revenue in England which I did not know much about.

'If he had done and the Revenue had investigated and been successful it would have been extremely expensive.'

He added: 'My fear was he would do something. I thought I could keep him peaceful and quiet and not do silly things.'

Following the sale of BayernLB's F1 stake to CVC, Mr Ecclestone was appointed chief executive of the equity group and was able to retain his controlling influence over F1.

Mr Ecclestone said the £27million commission he received was for facilitating the deal and giving the bank assurances that F1 was in rude health.

At the same trial last week Mr Ecclestone revealed his daughter Petra's wedding had cost an astonishing £12million.

But he admitted he only found out how much it had cost after the big day because his ex-wife settled the bill and didn’t tell him.

Mr Gribkowsky denies all charges against him. The case continues.
