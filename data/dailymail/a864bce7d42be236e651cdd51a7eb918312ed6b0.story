Britain faces a further wave of unemployed migrants arriving from southern Europe, as struggling Croatia became the latest country to join the EU.

Croatia, which has a youth jobless rate of more than 50 per cent, became a member at midnight, meaning its citizens can travel freely to Britain from today.

The news comes as a major international survey revealed tens of thousands of southern European workers have been coming here since the start of the eurozone crisis.

The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report reveals numbers of migrants fleeing here from countries hit by the euro crisis are close to the 100,000-a-year mark.

Croatia became the latest country to join the EU

Croatia has a population of 4.2million and overall joblessness rate of more than 20 per cent.

However Croatians must wait until their country has been in the EU for seven years, till 2020, before they can take jobs here.

Migrants fleeing Greece, Spain and Italy to look for work in Britain have almost doubled amid the the recession, the OECD said.

Spain and Greece’s emigration is more than twice the rate of 2007 and, it added, ‘the main countries of destination are Germany and the United Kingdom’.

Britain received 88,000 from southern European countries in 2011 and Germany 78,000.

Like citizens of Romania and Bulgaria – who will have the right to work in Britain from January – people from Croatia must wait until their country has been in the EU for seven years before they can take jobs in this country.

The report said: ‘As the debt crisis has followed on the heels of the financial crisis in a number of countries, the deteriorating labour market situation in some of them has resulted in an increase in the outflows of their nationals in search of work towards other OECD countries, which have been less affected, if at all, by the economic downturn and debt crisis.

‘This is especially true for the countries of southern Europe.’

The OECD’s International Migration Outlook report added: ‘The main countries of destination are Germany and the United Kingdom, with flows to these two having almost doubled in recent years and reached 80,000 or more.’

The OECD report has derived its count from national insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals in Britain.

However the official British figures for EU immigration are notoriously unreliable, since no checks are made on people coming into the country on EU passports, who enjoy the right freely to travel and work here.

The Office for National Statistics uses a survey, the International Passenger Survey, carried out among arrivals at ports and airports, to reach its estimates.

Unemployment in Britain is low compared to levels in other EU countries. The jobless rate here is 7.8 per cent among those willing to work, compared to 27 per cent, more than a quarter of the workforce, in both Spain and Greece.

Youth unemployment in this country, among workers aged 16 to 24, is just over 20 per cent, compared to nearly 63 per cent in Greece and more than 56 per cent in Spain. Greece is suffering political unrest as well as deep economic hardship.

Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch think tank said: ‘These numbers do not tally with British immigration numbers, but they do seem to be evidence that Germany and the UK are the main destination for workers from southern Europe as a result of the economic crisis.’

Croatia has gone through seven years of tortuous and often unpopular reform under Brussels instructions in order to become the 28th EU country while the eurozone remains deeply mired in crisis.

It has handed over more than a dozen Croatian and Bosnian Croat military and political leaders charged with 1990s war crimes by the United Nations tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.

It has privatised shipyards, steeped in history and tradition but deeply indebted, and launched a high-profile fight against corruption that saw former prime minister Ivo Sanader jailed.

There remain concerns at the level of graft and organised crime. Croatian citizens get immediate freedom of movement rights across the EU, but have to wait through a seven-year period before they get free access to labour markets in Britain and other EU states with the most jobs on offer.

Citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in 2007, have the right to work in this country from January. There are powerful signs that many thousands will take advantage of their new right to work in Britain.

The OECD figures, from national 
insurance numbers issued to overseas nationals, do not correspond with 
those from the Office for National Statistics.
