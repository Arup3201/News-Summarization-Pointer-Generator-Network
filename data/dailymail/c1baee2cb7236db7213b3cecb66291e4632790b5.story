Michael Jackson was a 'basket case' who would 'fall on his ass' if he attempted one of his trademark dance moves, according to an email written by the production manager of the star's planned comeback tour, a court heard.

In the message to AEG live director Randy Phillips, sent just five days before Jackson died, production manager John 'Bugzee' Hougdahl raised concerns about the singer's poor physical and mental health.

He wrote: 'I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks. He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now.'

Houghdal told Phillips how AEG live director Kenny Ortega had sent Jackson home early from rehearsal.

He wrote: 'He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage, or worse yet -- get hurt. The company is rehearsing right now, but the DOUBT is pervasive.'

Ortega also wrote to AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips raising his concerns about the star's ability to perform.

He said: 'I honestly don't think he is ready for this based on his continued physical weakening and deepening emotional state.'

He said Jackson was having trouble 'grasping the work' at rehearsals.

Ortega,
who knew Jackson well and worked with him closely preparing his 'This 
Is It' shows, described seeing 'strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and 
obsessive-like behavior' with Jackson.

Jackson would 'fall on his ass' if he tried to do a 360 degrees spin production manager John 'Bugzee' Hougdah, claimed in an emaill

'I think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist to evaluate him ASAP.'

In his reply to Ortega, Phillips said: 'Please stay steady. Enough alarms have sounded. It is time to put out the fire, not burn the building down.'

At an earlier hearing Phillips has explained thatÂ  by 'burn the building down,' he meant pulling the plug on the tour.

Michael Jackson died after Dr. Conrad Murray administered an overdose of anaesthetic propofol on June 25, 2009.

Murray, who agreed to work on the 'This Is It' shows for $150,000 a month, provided Jackson with propofol as a sleep aid.

Lawyers for the Jackson family claim AEG bosses could have prevented his death if they had heeded warning signs about his health and mental condition.

The suit contends AEG had hired, retained or supervised Dr Murray, however AEG denies this and claims it bears no responsibility for Jackson's death.

On the day the emails were exchanged Phillips met with Dr Murray, Jackson and Ortega at Jackson's home.

The Jackson family's lawyers claim AEG used the meeting to put pressure on Dr Murray to ensure Jackson was fit to rehearse.

AEG lawyers argue that Dr Murray had assured the producer's there was nothing to worry about.

The court heard yesterday from a doctor who treated Michael Jackson during a 1993 concert tour that had to be canceled when the singer entered rehab testified Monday about the signs that led him to conclude the singer had a problem with prescription pain medications at the time.

In videotaped testimony, Dr. Stuart 
Finkelstein said he was later asked by concert promoter AEG Live to act 
as Jackson's personal physician during the ill-fated 'This Is It' tour 
in 2009 but wanted to know if Jackson was 'clean.'

AEG executive Paul Gongaware said he didn't believe Jackson had any prescription drug issues, Finkelstein testified.

Finkelstein's testimony was recorded 
during a February deposition that was played for jurors hearing a 
negligence lawsuit by Jackson's mother against AEG Live LLC.

Katherine 
Jackson claims AEG failed to properly investigate another doctor who 
later gave her son an overdose of propofol and that the 
company ignored warning signs about her son's health.

Finkelstein
said he first suspected Jackson had a dependence on pain medications in
1993 while working on the 'Dangerous' tour. He recounted spending 24 
hours in the singer's hotel suite and administering morphine 
intravenously to deal with Jackson's pain.

He
said he gave Jackson morphine during their first meeting because the 
singer's buttocks were scarred from previous unspecified treatments and 
he was concerned about giving an injection of the painkiller Demerol.

He
said he also noticed that Jackson appeared to have a high tolerance for
morphine and had on a patch that administered another opiate drug.

Finkelstein
said he gave Jackson one other painkiller treatment before the 
'Dangerous' tour was halted after what he described as an intervention 
by Elizabeth Taylor and others in Mexico City.

Jurors
also heard Monday from Kenny Ortega, a choreographer and director who 
worked with Jackson on preparations for the 'Dangerous' tour and later 
shows, including 'This Is It.'

Ortega
was not present on the 'Dangerous' tour at the same time as Finkelstein
and testified that he never saw Jackson take any medications. Ortega 
will resume testifying on Tuesday afternoon.

Finkelstein, who now specializes in addiction medicine and works for concert promoters treating injuries to performers, said he relayed his concerns about Jackson's painkiller use to Gongaware, then a 'Dangerous' tour worker.

Gongaware is now a top AEG Live executives and a friend of Finkelstein, the physician said.

Finkelstein said he and Gongaware had five to 10 conversations in 2009 about working on Jackson's 'This Is It' shows. Finkelstein said he wanted $40,000 a month and was not hired.
