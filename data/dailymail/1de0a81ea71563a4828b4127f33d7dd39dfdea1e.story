She started swimming with her brother as a way to make friends because, as she says, 'we didn't know anybody'.

But Katie Ledecky won't need to worry about not being recognised anymore after the 15-year-old, and the youngest member of Team USA, breezed to a gold medal on Friday.

Ledecky flew into the lead during the women's 800m freestyle and snatched the title with a time of 8:14.63, beating defending Olympics champion, British swimmer Rebecca Adlington.

Winner: Fifteen-year-old Katie Ledecky holds her gold medal after winning the women's 800m freestyle final and setting a new U.S. record. She first started swimming as a way to make friends

Her time even smashed the U.S. record of 8:16.22, which had been held by Janet Evans since 1989, and just missed the world record of 8:14.10, set by Adlington in Beijing in 2008.

She won four seconds ahead of Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain, who touched 
in 8:18.76, while Adlington 
finished in 8:20.32 for bronze.

Not bad for a girl who's only just completed her freshman year of high school and hasn't even got her driver's learning permit yet.

Ledecky is the youngest of the 529 Team USA athletes and now the second youngest swimming gold medalist in the team's history after Beth Botsford, who won gold in Atlanta in
1996.

She had never even swam a major competition before the Olympic tryouts in June, as her coach had wanted her to work steadily towards the big titles despite her obvious talent.

Shock: Ledecky gasps as she realises she has won gold on Friday. Her astonishing time comes just two months after she took part in her first major competition

Joy: Before the race, Ledecky's mother said they were just hoping for a good experience - nothing more

Power: Ledecky's time of 8:14.63 just fell short of the world record of 8:14.10, set at the last Olympics

'I always thought of the Olympics as 
this unreal thing,' Ledecky, who stands at 5 ft 10, said earlier this summer. 'My only goal, 
when I was six, was to make the A meets.'

Rather than swimming in the senior nationals last summer, she swam in the junior nationals, where she won three events and the high-point trophy.

'Katie could 
have skipped some steps, but she has learned from each experience and 
still moved up the competitive ladder,' Coach Yuri Suguiyama said.

'Some people questioned us not taking her to Nationals last summer, but I
think it was great that she was able to go to Juniors, win four races 
and win the high-point award.'

The hard, consistent work of her coaches in her hometown of Bethesda, Maryland has clearly paid off; Ledecky swam 21 seconds faster in 
London than she had the same time last year.

Having fun: Ledecky's mother said she has enjoyed the camaraderie of the Games and has come out her shell

She's not the first 15-year-old from Maryland to qualify for the Olympics. The last was Michael Phelps in 2000. He now has the most Olympics medals ever at a staggering 21.

Her family joined their local Maryland pool in 2003, and she and her brother Michael joined the swimming team as a way to make friends because 'we didn't know anybody', she explained.

Despite meeting friends in the pool and at Stone Ridge High School, Ledecker and her teammates admit that she is still shy and reserved.

'I’m not into much pop 15-year-old kind 
of things,' she told Yahoo Sports, adding that she doesn't even have her driving 
learner's permit yet.

'She is adorable,' veteran swimmer 
Natalie Coughlin added to NBC. 'The first few days she was 
so quiet because she was really young.

Support: After the race, Ledecky hugs British swimmer Rebecca Adlington who won the event in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and set a new world record. This year, Adlington won bronze

Disbelief: Ledecky, pictured hugging Adlington, said the Olympics were never on her radar

'But with rookie skits and everything 
else, she really broke out of her shell. It's hard when you're 15, but 
she's doing an amazing job.'

Before her daughter's astonishing feat, Mary Ledecky said it was this social aspect of the Olympics that Katie was enjoying most, but that they had no expectations for anything more - like a medal.

'She loves being on the team and really 
appreciates and respects the vets on the squad,' Mrs Ledecky, who is in London to watch her daughter, said.

'She's enjoyed practicing with them. There a couple 
traditions the team has. The rookies put on a skit for the vets. She 
participated in that. She participated in the YouTube video that some of
the older kids on the team spearheaded.

'They've just been terrific. 
Overall, she's going to come away from this with a really great 
experience. That's what we hope for.'

Emotional: With tears in her eyes, Ledecky waves from the podium after winning her gold medal

She went on: 'We don't have any expectations for her 
at this meet. We want her to swim well. If she 
makes the finals, we'll be thrilled because we'll have another event to 
go and see her swim in.'

Ledecky's mother said they never even imagined her daughter would make it to the Olympic trials - and was stunned when she actually qualified.

'We hadn't made any plans to come to London,' she said.

When asked, before the race, what they would do with a medal if Ledecky won, her mother appeared taken aback at the possibility.

'I don't know,' she said. 'We haven't thought about that. She'd 
probably show it to all of her friends.'
