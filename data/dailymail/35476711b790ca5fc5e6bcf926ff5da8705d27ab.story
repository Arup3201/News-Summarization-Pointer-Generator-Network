A lorry driver inadvertently carried out some extreme littering today when his transporter overturned and spewed out tons of scrap metal from a bridge on to the M6.

Commuters on the busy stretch of motorway near Walsall had a lucky escape when the hefty J.R. Foster vehicle flipped on to its side and a tangle of metal debris poured down a bank before spilling across two lanes of the northbound carriageway.

Incredibly the lorry driver who lost control of his vehicle was unhurt in the incident.

Messy: A scrap lorry overturned on a motorway bridge over Junction 10 of the M6 spewing metal pieces onto the road below in Wolverhampton today

Metal mountain: The tangled mound of scrap contained old kitchen sinks as well as other used bits of metal

Hanging rough: The driver of the lorry was crossing a bridge over the M6 when he lost control and his vehicle rolled

The incident happened during rush hour and no other vehicles were affected.

Officers from West Midlands Police arrived at the scene just after 9.40am and were forced to close the motorway while they cleared the mound of metal, causing miles of tailbacks.

Northbound traffic was forced to exit
the motorway at junction ten and re-enter via the island on 
Wolverhampton Road, by Walsall during the clear up and recovery operation.

The were long delays and congestion around junction ten following the incident with one lane re-opened to traffic shortly after midday.

What a tip: As it rolled onto its side, tonnes of scrap metal fell out of the lorry and off the bridge onto two lanes of the northbound carriageway at junction 10 near Walsall

Lucky escape: No other vehicles were involved in the incident and there were no injuries - despite scrap metal covering two lanes during rush hour

Clear up operation: Officers from West Midlands Police arrived at the 
scene just after 9.40am and were forced to close the motorway while they
cleared the area, causing miles of tailbacks

Dump: Onlookers can't believe their eyes as the river of metal flows down the bank and on to the carriageway below

Incident: Police were called just after 9.40am this morning to the report of a lorry overturned and shedding its load of scrap metal near to the north bound exit of junction ten M6

Tailbacks: One lane was reopened to traffic shortly after midday after several hours of congestion
