Their stone tools may have been simple and their dwellings made from simple straw huts, but ancient Britons were in fact ahead of the times - literally - when it came to the world's first ever calendar.

That's the claim of archaeologists who believe they have found evidence of a giant 'year clock' capable of tracking lunar months and the changing seasons in a field near Banchory in Aberdeenshire.

Dating back 10,000 years, it is twice the age of time-keeping systems created by the ancient Mesopotamians, which were thought to be the world's oldest.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Vincent Gaffney, professor of landscape archaeology at Birmingham University, said: 'The capacity to measure time if among the most important achievements of human societies and the issue of when time was "created" by humankind is critical in understanding how society developed.'

Gaffney and his team analysed the findings of previous excavations at Warren Field, which had once been home to a Mesolithic (middle Stone Age) settlement in 8,000BC.

A series of pits, perhaps used to hold large posts or stones, mystified archaeologists at the time.

But the Birmingham University academics found the pits were aligned with key astronomical events, such as the phases of the moon and the midwinter sunrise.

A full report will be released tomorrow, but among their findings is evidence suggesting this calendar could track the mid-winter sun.

Many early calendars were designed to track calendar months, but could not tell users when a year had passed.

This is because the lunar calendar differs from the amount of time taken for the Earth to orbit the sun.

Ancient tribes failed to recognise this and so their calendars became increasingly out of step with the time of year as shown by the sun.

The Stone Age inhabitants in Aberdeenshire however noticed this problem and used their calendar to work out when the mid-winter solstice had arrived.

They then used this information to 'reset' the lunar clock system.

Gaffney said: 'The monument anticipates problems associated with simple lunar calendars by providing an annual astronomic correction in order to maintain the link between the passage of time, indicated by the moon, and the asynchronous solar year and associated seasons.'

The use of a calendar also suggests the inhabitants of Warren Field were not just hunter-gathers but had something of a settled existence and wanted the ability to track time.

It is close to the River Dee, where fish supplies were plentiful, and in the middle of forests full of game.

Gaffney added: 'This suggests that early hunter-gatherer societies in Scotland had both the need and ability to track time across the years - and perhaps within the month - and that this occurred 5,000 years before the first formal calendars were created in Mesopotamia.

The Warren Field calendar predates a number of time tracking methods including Stonehenge, built in 2,400BC and which may have been used to track time.

It is also older than the Mayan Calendar, established before 500BC and the 365-day Julian Calendar, introduced by Roman emperor Julius Caesar in 45BC.
