The body of Dane McNeill was found charred in Sydney's south-west on Monday

The family of a man whose burned body was found in a park have expressed their horror at his death.

The badly burned body of Dane McNeill, 20, was found by a council worker, who was preparing to open the gate at the Lambeth Street Reserve at Picnic Point, on a roadway just after 5am on Monday.

The man's burns were so severe efforts to identify him and his age had been difficult. Police said on Wednesday a post-mortem confirmed it was Mr McNeill.

Family fear the stonemason had become caught up with drug dealers.

'If you think that you can play in this world you need to think again,' his grandmother, Elsie McNeill, told the Ten Network.

'You can't even imagine how wicked these people are.'

The Narellan man was reported missing last Friday.

It emerged on Thursday that Mr McNeill had twice been busted for drugs. On one occasion he was caught high on ice and with three knives on a Sydney suburban street.

When police on May 20 searched his padlocked bag in a car at St Andrews, they found digital scales, a black wallet with crystal methamphetamine-filled capsules and a drug tick book, with names and dollar amounts.

When police searched him two weeks earlier in another car in the same south-west suburb, they found a "nervous" Mr McNeill with three knives and 0.22 grams of ice.

Mr McNeill had pleaded guilty in Campbelltown Local Court last month to a string of drug charges, including supply and possession, stemming from the May drug busts.

When Mr McNeill was granted bail following the second bust on May 20, police found there was an unacceptable risk he would offend again, court documents state.

However, police decided the risk could be mitigated by the strict conditions of living with his family in Narellan and adhering to an overnight curfew.

But it seems his parents were fed up.

'My parents told me to leave and I have no choice,' Mr McNeill later informed the court as to why he needed to change his bail address.

Ryan McNeill, 13, said his brother's killers could hurt others.

'It was sick what they done to him,' he said. 'These people could do it to other people.

Ryan also urged people with information about his brother's death to come forward.

'Tell the police what they can so those people can get locked up,' he said.

Friends of Mr McNeill took to Facebook as news of his death broke.

'Can't stop thinkin about you Dane McNeill didn't deserve it, won't forget you bro,' Dom Mosca wrote on Tuesday.

Other friends shared memories of Mr McNeill, while some others left simple goodbyes.

'Rest easy brother never gonna forget you,' Blake Mills said.

Mr McNeill's final Facebook post was on July 16, just days before his death.

'I believe that everything happens for a reason,' Mr McNeill said.

'People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right.

'You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.'

Superintendent Dave Eardley confirmed the body had been burned beyond recognition on Monday.

'But other than saying it's a male person, it's very hard to expand on that at the moment," he told reporters.

'We are hopeful we might be able to narrow down a time-frame when the person was brought here.'

Supt Eardley said police want to hear from anyone who noticed cars stopping or suspicious activity around Henry Lawson Drive during Sunday night.

'I think it would be fair to conclude that the body was brought here at some stage during the evening,' he said.

Mr McNeill was reported missing on Friday and was found at Picnic Point

He confirmed one scenario would be someone carrying the body, which was found 50 metres inside the reserve boundary, to its leafy resting place.

Supt Eardley said he could not fathom why someone would burn a body.

'Any time a person loses their life is a tragedy,' he said.

'This is compounded by the fact that someone has chosen then to do that to a body.

'I can't fathom that, I don't think any rational person in our community can make sense of that.'

Nearby resident Sue Parmaxidis said she heard an explosion early on Monday morning.

'It was a loud noise and would have been from about 4.30am or 10 to five,' she told reporters.

'You could say it might have been an explosion, it was like a bang.'

Ms Parmaxidis said the reserve was popular with families and children.

Investigations are continuing.
