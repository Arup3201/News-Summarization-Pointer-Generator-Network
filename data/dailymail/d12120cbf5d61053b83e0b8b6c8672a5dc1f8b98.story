Ritual: Chun Michael Deng died after being knocked unconscious during a fraternity hazing

The 19-year-old New York college student who died from brain injuries after a hazing has been pictured as police claim that his fraternity brothers tried to cover up how he got his injuries.

Members of Pi Delta Psi allegedly failed to get medical attention for Chun Michael Deng for more than an hour, as they changed him into dry clothes and researched his symptoms on the internet.

Brothers from Baruch College also removed fraternity related items from the Pennsylvania home they were in, according to a police affidavit.

Mr Deng, died from head injuries on Monday, after three fellow students took him to the hospital at about 6.40am on Sunday.

He had been knocked unconscious between 5am and 5.30am earlier that day.

According to a police report seen by the Daily News: 'Deng was reported to be unconscious 
and unresponsive immediately after he fell ...Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive.'

Police believe the student received his injuries during a hazing ritual called the Glass Ceiling, where people are blindfolded and made to drag sand-filled bags across a room while being tackled by members of the fraternity.

Members of the fraternity had initially said Mr Deng had hurt himself while wrestling in snow outside the rented property, about 100 miles from the Manhattan campus.

A Pennsylvania prosecutor has said charges in the case are expected once the police investigation ends.

The level of charges and who specifically will be charged is not clear, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine told CNN.

'As a result of this incident we are immediately suspending all new member education nationwide until further notice', national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, said in a statement.

Fraternity ritual: Police are investigating how an NYC student died over the weekend in Pennsylvania

The
Monroe County District Attorney's office said the 19-year-old was injured at a Tunkhannock Township residence, 
where about 30 members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity had travelled for 
the weekend.

The township is in northeastern Pennsylvania, about 30 miles north of Allentown.Â 

Mr Deng, a freshman at Baruch College, was one of four students pledging to the fraternity in the hazing ritual, the practice of humiliating newcomers as part of their initiation into the group.

Pocono
Mountain Regional Police Chief Harry Lewis told NBC News that the 
pledges were told they had to get from one point to another while 
blindfolded.

They had to carry loads while the others pushed him over, knocking him unconscious.

The national website for Pi Delta Psi said that it takes 'hazing allegations very seriously'.

The
fraternity identifies itself as 'an Asian American Cultural Fraternity'
founded in 1994, with a mission 'to spread Asian American Cultural 
awareness.'

Baruch College issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon that said: 'The
preliminary reports indicate that Michael died over the weekend while 
participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event.'

'Baruch 
College had no knowledge of this event or that the fraternity was 
rushing a pledge class. Pi Delta Psi did not request permission nor were
they approved by Baruch on this matter.'

The
school also said that it has a 'zero tolerance policy regarding hazing'
and that all fraternities and sororities are required to attend an 
orientation session that includes anti-hazing training, and sign 
statements that they understand the policies.

'Michael's
death is a deeply painful reminder that no individual should ever be 
put into a position where his or her personal safety is in jeopardy. Our
deepest sympathies go out to Michael's family and his friends.'
