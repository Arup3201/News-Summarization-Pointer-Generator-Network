Guilty: Rapist Edward Putman covers his face as he leaves St Albans Magistrates Court where he pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud

A convicted rapist who won nearly £5million on the lottery had the gall to claim £13,000 in benefits after persuading the authorities that he didn't have enough money to eat.

Edward Putman wrote letters to his local council  pleading for his benefits to be reinstated after they had been stopped - despite having secret millions stashed away in another account.

He failed to tell the Department for Work and Pensions, who had been 
paying him income support, about his fortune, as well as his local council, who had been paying him housing benefit while he was living the high life.

As
a result, benefit payments to scheming Putman, who lives in a £600,000 home in upmarket Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, began once more and, over
20 months, he cheated the taxpayer out of £13,000 he was not entitled too.

His
dishonesty was only discovered later when he applied to 
buy his council flat in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, for £83,000 under a 
Right to Buy scheme and said he would pay in cash.

Those paying his benefits were immediately suspicious and an investigation of his financial affairs began.

Today, Putman pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud when he appeared at St Albans Magistrates’ Court in Hertfordshire.

The 47-year-old, who was jailed for seven years for raping a 17-year-old woman at her home in Milton Keynes in 1993, scooped his windfall in September 2009 and spent the cash on two sports cars and houses.

At the time of the attack, the woman was pregnant with his child and despite her injuries her unborn child survived and is now 19. He has never received a penny in support from his biological father, who also has a conviction for violence, and now his mother is planning on suing him for the agony he caused her and wants to 'see him penniless'.

Today, magistrates said the offences were 
too serious for sentencing under the powers available to them, and the 
case was committed to St Albans Crown Court on July 24.

Protection: Putman is pictured leaving court trying to shield his face and with an entourage of bodyguards

Cheat: Edward Putman, left, in September 1999 and right, at a recent court appearance. He began receiving income support in 2000 after being incapacitated by anxiety issues and his benefits were suspended in 2009

The court heard Putman began receiving income support in 2000 on the basis of his being incapacitated by anxiety issues.

In
order to do so he needed proof from his doctor of his mental health 
problems and signed a document confirming that he would notify the 
authorities if his condition changed.

But
when he failed to attend a medical check-up in 2009, his benefits were 
suspended, before being officially ended in April the following year.

In
July 2010, 10 months after being made a millionaire by his lottery win,
he wrote to the Department of Work and Pensions, begging them to 
reinstate his benefits.

He claimed he did not attend the medical examination because he was too ill.

'I lost a lot of weight and had lot to deal with,' he wrote.

'I didn’t know whether I would still be alive. I’m on the brink of being evicted.'

Riches: Edward Putman's £600,000 four-bedroom home in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire. He won the lottery in 2009 and spent the money on two sports cars and a new house

Property: Putman's home from the front. The authorities became suspicious when he went to council wanting to buy his council house under the right-to-buy scheme telling them he had the £84,000 needed to buy it in cash

He also wrote to Dacorum Borough Council saying that he had been forced to survive on handouts from his family and friends, and had not been able to pay his council tax or rent, apart from putting £200 towards it, which he had borrowed from his family.

The court heard that his benefits were then reinstated and were also back-dated, as he had asked them to be, to January 2010.

But the court heard that the authorities became suspicious when, that October, he went to the council asking if he could buy his council house under the right-to-buy scheme, telling them he had the £84,000 needed to buy it in cash.

Further investigation then found that Putman also had an account with St James’s Bank - the bank recommended to lottery winners by operator Camelot.

Edward Putman's victim has told how she was pregnant with his child when he raped her

Its records showed that, on September 10 2009, two large sums of cash were paid into his account with them - one for just over £2.5 million, and the other for £2.4 million, prosecutor Hita Mashru said.

Putman was invited to be interviewed under caution, in which he said he had not spent any of the money he received in benefits because he knew it would have to be paid back.

The court heard he claimed a total of £4,809.18 from Dacorum Borough Council between September 2009 and October 2010, and £8,033.59 from the Department for Work and Pensions between between September 2009 and May last year.

'When you look at the entirety of the facts in full in relation to how this has gone about, it’s very calculating,' Ms Mashru said.

She added that Putman had opted not to go public with his lottery win.

'You may see that it’s very clear why. He has previous convictions and the fact that he was claiming benefits, clearly any publicity would have warned the Department for Work and Pensions that he was a person who should not have been receiving benefits.'

During mitigation, the court heard that the defendant had admitted his deceit during questioning and had now paid back the money he owed in full.

Bearded Putman sat at the front of the court dressed in a grey anorak and grey trousers.

He was released on unconditional bail until his sentencing.
