The number of cinema tickets bought in the United States in 2014 fell to its lowest level in nearly 20 years - despite the fact that the box office raked in more than $10 billion.

Some 1.259 billion tickets were bought in the past year, the lowest number since 1995 when 1.211 billion people went to the cinema.

The figure is down six per cent on the 1.34 billion tickets that were sold in 2013, meaning that 81 million people who went to the cinema last year chose not to in 2014.

Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8m

The statistics, reported by Deadline, include January 1-December 31. 

Movie distribution chiefs have put the disappointing sales down to distractions such as video games, the increase in viral videos and online streaming sites such as Netflix.

But despite relatively low ticket sales in 2014, as of last weekend six studios had made in excess of $1billion this year, including Fox, Disney, Warner Bros, Sony, Paramount and Universal.

In fact, 2014 is the sixth year in a row to pass the $10billion mark and this year's takings are currently three per cent higher than 2011.

1. Guardians of the Galaxy ($332.8m)

2. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ($306.7m)

3. Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($259.8m)

4. The LEGO Movie ($257.8m)

5. Transformers: Age of Extinction ($245.4m)

6. Maleficent ($241.4m)

7. X-Men Days Of Future Past ($233.9m)

8. Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes ($208.5m)

9. Amazing Spider-Man 2 ($202.9m)

10. Godzilla ($200.7m)

This week, figures from Box Office Mojo, reported that Guardians Of The Galaxy was the number one film at the US box office in 2014 with ticket sales of $332.8 million.

The Marvel space adventure starring Chris Pratt, 35, as Peter Quill and his alter-ego Star-Lord was released on August 1 and was the first film to pass the $300 million mark this year. 

The film, also starring Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, was a  a risk for Marvel as it centered on lesser known comic book characters but it found an eager audience.

It was followed closely in second place by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, which remains in theaters and has taken in a haul to date of $306.7 million.

The film's star Jennifer Lawrence popped up again in the seventh-place finisher X-Men Days Of Future Past which earned $233.9 million.

The 24-year-old actress last week was named the highest-grossing actor in Hollywood in 2014 with her films taking in $1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. 

Marvel also landed the third-highest grossing movie of the year with Captain America: The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan earning $259.8 million domestically. 

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, starring Jennifer Lawrence, has taken in a haul to date of $306.7m
