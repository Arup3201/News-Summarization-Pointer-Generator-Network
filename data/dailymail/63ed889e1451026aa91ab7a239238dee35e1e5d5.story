Home-owners in one of Britain’s busiest commuter towns were today celebrating the extension of the £14.8billion Crossrail scheme to include Reading.

From 2019, the cross-London fast-train service will also include the busy Berkshire commuter  town – giving a fast track for workers in the City,  the Government announced.

As well as benefiting commuters, the improved travel links are also likely to push up house prices in the Reading and Twyford area.

The £14bn Crossrail scheme will extend as far as Reading to the west of London, it has been announced today. Pictured is the new extended route

There had been intense speculation that the line could be extended further west from Maidenhead  - given a major refurbishment of reading station - although until today there had been no firm decision on this.

Crossrail stretches from Berkshire in the west to as far east as Shenfield in Essex and also takes in spurs to Heathrow Airport in west London and to Abbey Wood in south east London.

Transport Minister Stephen Hammond said that, once Crossrail services began across the whole line in 2019, passengers travelling to London from Reading and other Thames Valley stations would be able to reach more destinations across London without the need to change at Paddington.

Once operational, Crossrail services are expected to serve Maidenhead on a four-trains-per-hour basis as originally planned, with two of these services continuing to Reading via Twyford.

In addition, the planned future Great Western franchise service pattern from Reading to London will not change. Twice hourly, semi-fast services and existing fast mainline services will continue, calling at the same stations as today.

Mr Hammond said the Reading extension will also generate some cost savings from reduced infrastructure enhancements at Maidenhead and Slough, and only minor works will be required at Twyford and Reading to accommodate Crossrail services.

Rail minister Mr Hammond said the extension of Crossrail to Reading was ‘further proof of our commitment to deliver a transport network fit for the 21st century.’

He said: ‘It will improve connectivity and deliver greater choice and convenience for passengers travelling into London. It will also make better use of the already congested Great Western Main Line.’

He said this would free up capacity for potential direct services from Reading to Heathrow as part of the western access scheme.

The minister said he had also asked Network Rail to look at the cost benefit analysis of ‘increasing the number of faster trains between Reading and Paddington.’

Mike Brown , managing director of London Underground and London Rail, said:  ‘Extending Crossrail to Reading will provide passengers with more journey options and will create better connections and direct services between Reading, Twyford and destinations across London without the need to interchange at Paddington.’

Trains will be introduced to run Crossrail services as follows:

Ministers said Crossrail will boost 
London’s rail capacity by 10per cent by connecting Reading and Heathrow 
in the west with Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. Up to 24 trains 
an hour will run between Paddington and Whitechapel during peak times.

A Transport department spokesman said: ’It is estimated that Crossrail will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full-time jobs around the UK. Three out of 5 businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside London.’

London mayor  Boris Johnson said: ‘I am thrilled that the people of Reading and Twyford will be able to take advantage of Crossrail, putting them on the doorstep of London's main employment centres by directly linking them to the City and West End in world-class style.’

Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh MP said: ‘Labour in government safeguarded the potential Crossrail route from Maidenhead to Reading, so we welcome the decision to extend Crossrail to Reading.

‘This is good news for commuters struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and will make the most of Labour's investment in Reading station, which should help the Thames Valley economy to grow faster.’

Reading East Conservative MP Rob Wilson, although welcoming the extension, said: ‘This can only be seen as stage one in the process of delivering Crossrail for Reading. This first phase will not reap the full benefits that Crossrail can and should bring to benefit people and businesses in Reading and the wider region.

‘Because there will be so many stops between here and London, journey times to London will be no faster than they are now.’
