France is preparing laws that will jail people for encouraging binge drinking on the internet or selling products which make drunkenness look fun.

Although the French are renowned for their laissez-faire attitude to alcohol, the new laws tabled yesterday will crack down on those who incite people to binge drink on the internet, as well as those selling t-shirts, mobile phone covers and other gimmicky products which portray it as fun.

Marisol Touraine, the French Health Minister, said: 'We have to put a stop to drunkenness that does such damage to young people.'

Alcohol-related admissions at French hospitals increased sharply last year and health experts have warned binge drinking is a growing problem in the country

Touraine said she wanted to target  'games or objects that glorify the excessive consumption of alcohol', such as t-shirts or mobile phone covers with amusing scenes of drunkenness.

She went to add the draft legislation also aimed to prevent 'inciting people to drink on the Internet.'

The punishment for 'directly provoking a minor to excessive consumption of alcohol' will be a year in jail and a fine of £12,000 (€15,000).

And anyone who incites someone else to 'drink until drunk' will be liable to six months in prison and a fine of £6,000 (€7,500).

Last year France saw short term hospital admissions for binge drinking symptoms increase by a staggering 80 per cent.

Despite being one of the world's key producers of wine and spirits, the French are often perceived to have a healthy attitude towards alcohol with most drinking done at mealtimes and rarely to excess.

Last year Professor Michel Reynaud, an addiction specialist in Paris, co-authored a report into alcohol-related hospital admissions in France.

The laws will crack down on encouragement of binge drinking, and in particular the encouragement of minors. Pictured is a vineyard in the wine producing region of Champagne

He said young French women were turning more and more to binge drinking in order to show off to their friends.

‘It is particularly worrying that large numbers of young girls see getting drunk as a form of glory.

‘This is a health emergency. We have no longer government money to cope with this problem. When one considers the rising scale of it it is hard to see how it can be stopped.’ 

According to the French Society for Alcohol abuse, hospital admissions for drink related diseases , particularly among young people, are now twice as numerous as those for common complains like diabetes or cardio vascular disease.
