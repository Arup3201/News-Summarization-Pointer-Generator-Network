Mark Noble has ended any uncertainty over his future by penning a new long-term contract at West Ham.

The Hammers skipper has stated his delight at committing his future to the Hammers until 2020,

Noble told West Ham's official website: 'I'm obviously over the moon because it takes me until I'm 33.

'I'm very happy with the contract and very grateful to the chairmen for giving me it and I'm looking forward to the next five years.

'I love playing football and I love playing for the club so to be rewarded with a new five-and-a-half year contract is fantastic.

'In football you don't get any younger, but I keep myself fit and this is great for me and my family, because it gives us security for the rest of our lives.

'It's not about the money, though. I always give 100 per cent in every game I play, even if it's not enough. As a West Ham fan, I know we'll lose games like everyone does, but I'm settled, I'm happy and that's when I play my best football.' 

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has tied Noble down to a new long-term deal 

His existing deal was due to expire at the end of the season, but the Hammers did have an option of extending his deal by a further two years.

Noble's future came under scrutiny in the final days of the transfer window.

West Ham's move for Darren Fletcher, who eventually joined West Brom, raised question marks over Noble's place in Sam Allardyce's plans.

However, the Hammers have underlined their commitment to Noble, and vice-versa, with the new deal.
