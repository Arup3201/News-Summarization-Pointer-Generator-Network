Demonstrators loyal to Ukraine were attacked with whips, baseball bats and clubs in Sevastopol yesterday as the mood in Crimea turned increasingly tense after the stealth invasion by Russia.

The assault by about 100 Cossacks and pro-Russian militiamen was described as ‘very savage’ by BBC reporter Ben Brown – who had to sprint to his hotel to escape the thugs.

The violence came after 200 people took part in a rally in Sevastopol to commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko.

Pro-Russian activists attacked a pro-Kiev rally in Crimea with clubs and whips on as thousands took to the streets across Ukraine in rival demonstrations, escalating separatist tensions in the troubled ex-Soviet state

Fighting started after a group of militia and Cossacks arrived at the rally, with both sides saying Crimea was ‘our country’.

One
 man was kicked, beaten and lashed with a Cossack’s whip, while the 
attackers also smashed the windscreen of a car and tried to turn it over
 with the terrified driver inside.

Brown later tweeted it was ‘a terrifying moment that was  a glimpse of the abyss Crimea hovers over’.Russian troops are now in effective control of the region, and have been joined by hundreds of

Cossack paramilitaries in recent days. Sevastopol in particular is a key strategic city and is largely sympathetic to Moscow.

However
 in Simferopol, the regional capital, rival rallies passed off 
peacefully. Several thousand people joined a pro-Russian protest in 
Lenin Square, while a far smaller number sang the Ukrainian national 
anthem.

The Russians 
appear to be continuing to build up troops in Crimea – where a slender 
majority of the 2.3million population are ethnic Russians – and are 
reported to have around 30,000 elite troops in the region.

The
 Ukrainian defence minister, however, said yesterday that there were no 
plans to send additional forces to resist the invasion, despite alleged 
intimidation and violence towards Ukrainians who are trapped behind the 
blockades.

Energy 
Secretary Ed Davey warned yesterday that fuel costs could rise as a 
result of the crisis in Crimea, but urged the Big Six energy firms not 
to cash in. He said they ‘shouldn’t use it as an excuse to put up 
prices’.

In Donetsk 
pro-Russians have set up a round-the-clock picket on the square under a 
red Soviet flag with the hammer and sickle and they are calling for a 
secession referendum like the one planned in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.

In Kiev, meanwhile, Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a crowd gathered at the statue to nationalist writer Shevchenko: 'This is our land... Our fathers and grandfathers have spilled their blood for this land. And we won't budge a single centimeter from Ukrainian land. Let Russia and its president know this.'

'We're one country, one family and we're here together with our kobzar (bard) Taras,' said acting President Oleksandr Turchynov.

In the afternoon, Ukrainians in the 
tens of thousands massed in their capital city's downtown for a 
multi-faith prayer meeting to show their unity and honor Shevchenko, a 
son of peasant serfs who is considered the father of modern Ukrainian 
literature and is a national hero.

One
 of the speakers, former imprisoned Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky,
 almost burst into tears as he implored the crowd to believe that not 
all Russians support their country's recent actions in Ukraine.

'I want you to know there is a completely different Russia,' Khodorkovsky said.

But in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it clear that he supports the March 16 referendum the regional parliament in Crimea plans to hold on leaving Ukraine to join Russia.

In phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Minister David Cameron yesterday, Putin defended the situation in Crimea where Russia has reinforced its armed presence, the Kremlin said.

'The steps taken by the legitimate 
leadership of Crimea are based on the norms of international law and aim
 to ensure the legal interests of the population of the peninsula,' said
 Putin, according to the Kremlin.

Following an extraordinary meeting of the Ukrainian government in Kiev yesterday, Yatsenyuk announced that he will fly to the United States this week for high-level talks on 'resolution of the situation in Ukraine,' the Interfax news agency reported.

'Our country and our people are facing the biggest challenges in the history of modern independent Ukraine,' the prime minister said earlier in the day.

Russia's occupation of Crimea will prove a 'big miscalculation' in the long-term, William Hague said as he sought to keep up pressure for a diplomatic solution.

The Foreign Secretary conceded that none of the sanctions being threatened by the West could remove Moscow's military forces from the Ukrainian peninsula.

But he said there would be 'very significant' consequences for Russia's future global influence if it refused to enter talks with Kiev over the stand-off.

The population of the key strategic region is due to vote in a referendum on becoming part of Russia in a week's time after pro-Russian forces seized control of key military and other facilities.

'It would be wrong to conclude that Russia has won in some sense. I think this will turn out over time to be quite a big miscalculation,' he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.

'The long-term consequences will be very significant for Russia.'

'Will we be able to deal with these challenges? There should only be one answer to this question and that is: yes.'

Crimea, a strategic peninsula in southern Ukraine, has become the flashpoint in the battle for Ukraine, where three months of protests sparked by President Victor Yanukovych's decision to ditch a significant treaty with the 28-nation European Union after strong pressure from Russia led to his downfall.

A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia, and Moscow's Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, as is Ukraine's.

This weekend, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ruled out any dialogue with Ukraine's new authorities, whom he dismissed as the puppets of extremists.

Senior lawmakers in Moscow have said they will support Ukraine's March 16 referendum, ignoring sanctions threats and warnings from President Barack Obama that the vote would violate international law.

In Simferopol, the Crimean capital, a crowd of more than 4,000 people turned out Sunday to endorse unification with Russia.

On Lenin Square, a naval band played World War II songs as old women sang along, and dozens of tricolor Russian flags fluttered in the cold wind.

Meanwhile, it was announced that U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House on Wednesday.

Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said the president would consult with Yatsenyuk and that the meeting demonstrated U.S. support for Ukraine.

Blinken says the White House strategy is to mobilize the international community behind Ukraine, isolate Russia for its actions and reassure U.S. allies and partners.

It happened during a pro-Ukrainian rally he described as 'terrifying'.
