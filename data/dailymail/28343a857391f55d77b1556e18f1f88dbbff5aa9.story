Passengers smashed open the windows of a smoke-filled Boston subway on Thursday after it stopped unexpectedly and the doors failed to open.

The Red Line train had pulled into Quincy Station at 7.20am when its propulsion system failed, officials explained.

One set of doors failed to open and smoke started sweeping the car, making it hard to breathe, passengers explained.

Taking action: A group that managed to pry open the doors of their own car then kicked a window

Taking action, a group that managed to pry open the doors of their own car kicked a window, smashing the glass, before pulling out the panicked commuters.

'Eventually, there was so much smoke it was becoming hard to breathe,' one of the group, 20-year-old student David West, told the Boston Globe.

West, who had been en route to his class at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said people were rushing to get out the station before noticing the locked cabin.

'My first thought was, "Oh man, there are people in there, that's not good",' he said.

Another member of the group, Kristin Bello, told the Globe: 'People were pretty shaken up, you could see the smoke billowing out of the train.'

Rescue: Commuters rescued those trapped inside by pulling them out of the opened window

MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo lashed out at the would-be saviours, insisting the doors were opening when they smashed the windows.

'There was no reason for this to happen. It’s unclear why some acted in such a manner,' he told the Globe.

He also denied that smoke filled the car.

But one of the trapped, Genevieve Davis, 65, said: 'The way the MBTA presented in the newspaper is insensitive and wrong.

'There was a problem: People were trapped in a car, we could not get out, we could smell a burning smell, we had people looking underneath the car thinking there was a fire about the consume the car.'

An investigation into the incident is ongoing.
