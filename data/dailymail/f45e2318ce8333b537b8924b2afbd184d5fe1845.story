Like binders full of women and Big Bird before them, Mitt Romney has become the target of a new string of memes from internet jokesters.

Before the conclusion of the third and final debate tonight, the World Wide Web was abuzz with horses and bayonets, a term that stole the show.

The president’s sarcastic retort to 
Romney's jab about the size of the Navy took off instantly on social 
networks and dominated online discussion of the candidates' final 
debate.

‘Well, 
governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets... We have these things
called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them,' Obama said.
