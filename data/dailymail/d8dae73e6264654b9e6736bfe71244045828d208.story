Ban: Morrisons has banned unaccompanied under-16s from buying energy drinks like Red Bull

Red Bull and other caffeine-loaded energy drinks are taken by millions to pep them up when they are tired or hungover.

In bars and clubs, Red Bull is a popular mixer with vodka and other spirits. Sales in Britain top £200million a year.

The drink started as a tonic to keep Thai truck drivers and factory workers awake during long shifts.

The ban applies to drinks containing at least 150mg of caffeine per litre - including Red Bull (320mg), Monster (338mg), and Relentless (320mg).

Morrisons is believed to be the first major UK retailer to bring in this restriction, although similar bans have been introduced in Sweden, Denmark and France.

It comes amid health fears about extreme-caffeine intake by children who consume energy drinks.

The soft drinks have long been a source of controversy - and have even been linked to deaths.

Last month, a family announced it was suing Red Bull for $85million (£52million) following the death of a father-of-one who died from a heart attack after downing the soft drink.

Cory Terry, 33, from Brooklyn, consumed the caffeine-based drink 45 minutes after playing basketball at Stephen Decatur Middle School in Brooklyn on November 8, 2011. He then collapsed and died.

Mr Terry's relatives are blaming the company which makes the energy boosting beverage for his death.

However, a Red Bull spokeman said that health authorities across the world have said it is safe to consume.

Shops have come under increasing pressure to stop selling high-caffeine drinks - with a Morrisons insider admitting that the company is frequently lobbied by MPs on the issue.

However, some shoppers have not taken kindly to the restriction.

Kate Webber, 23, said she was shocked to be asked for proof of age before being sold Red Bull at the supermarket's Southwood store in Farnborough, Hampshire.

Ms Webber, who was with her one-year-old son Oscar, said: 'At first I thought she was joking but she just sat there and gave me a serious look.

'I couldn’t believe they were asking for ID for a can of Red Bull. I was stunned. I am used to showing proof of age for alcohol because I look young, I have a baby face, but 16?'

However, after being informed about the ban, Ms Webber said she had decided to back the restriction.

'It’s sensible. When I was younger I loved Red Bull, it was like an adult drink, a step up from Coke,' she said.

'But I know people worry about the affects it can have, especially on kids, so I think it’s right.'

Morrisons spokesman Claire Johnson said the restriction is currently being trialled in selected Morrisons stores, with a view to rolling it out nationwide.

'We understand the concern that exists over the potential impact of high caffeine energy drinks on young people and are taking steps to address this,' she said.

'We adhere to the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) code of practice. This states that products containing more than 150mg caffeine per litre must carry the warning "Not suitable for children, pregnant women and persons sensitive to caffeine". 

'Currently, a number of our stores are not selling high caffeine drinks to under-16s unless they are accompanied by an adult.

'We are also implementing Challenge 25 scheme to ensure this is enforced consistently.

'We will monitor the impact of this policy carefully before deciding whether to roll it out across all of our stores.
