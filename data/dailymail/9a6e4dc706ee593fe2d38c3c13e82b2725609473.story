Roy Hodgson's row with Brendan Rodgers escalated when England’s head coach claimed Daniel Sturridge wanted to train on the day he picked up his thigh injury.

Sturridge, who has been left out of England’s squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, has not played since picking up the injury after England’s 1-0 win over Norway.

Rodgers claims the Liverpool forward is instructed not to train for 48 hours after a match, but Hodgson offered a very different version of events on Thursday.

England’s head coach said: ‘The interesting thing for the session where Daniel got injured is that he was quite keen to take part in that training session because he was such an important part of it and we were trying to develop a new system of play.

‘He was the forward who understood it best. He was more than happy to come in and help us to get our points over to the others.

‘It’s doubly unfortunate that he got injured. But injuries do happen. No manager has as yet said to me that players must not train two days after a game.

‘But I understand that Daniel is an important player and I understand Brendan being unhappy that he is injured.

‘You have to be careful saying injuries are preventable. We could have done a completely different training session or Daniel could have done a recovery session which Brendan might have thought was more suitable but I still couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t have been an injury.’

Hodgson insists he will not be dictated to by club managers over which players he can select for international duty, but Rodgers appears to have outmanoeuvred the England boss.

Sturridge has yet to train with the first team at Liverpool as he recovers, but there is a chance he will be a substitute in Saturday’s game against West Bromwich Albion. 

If Sturridge is included for the first time since the 3-0 victory at Tottenham on August 31, it will come as a severe embarrassment to Hodgson.

Rodgers said: ‘I respect Roy has work to do but my thoughts are for the Liverpool players and what their needs are.

‘We agreed it was too soon for Daniel to meet up irrespective of whether he is involved or not. He has not trained with the team at all so it was not the right time for him to go.

‘It was amicable, there is no issue. We will have to wait and see how he is. He can’t be ready to play for England if he is not ready to play for Liverpool. Liverpool is our priority.

‘He has had a Grade One injury now for near on four weeks which is a long time and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool.

Daniel Sturridge hasn't played since England's friendly win against Norway last month 

‘Once he is playing for Liverpool and showing that level of fitness, Roy will then look at him and get him into the squad.’

Hodgson also revealed on Thursday that Sturridge has now taken on the role as an unofficial team leader with England.

‘The one person who is unhappy is Daniel because he would have loved to have been with us,’ he added

England have confirmed they will play an international friendly away to Italy in March.
