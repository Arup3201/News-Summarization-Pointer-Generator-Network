A sex-trafficking survivor, who was chained in a basement and raped aged seven by her male nanny, spoke movingly at the Grammys on Sunday about her ordeal.

Before Katy Perry sang By The Grace Of God, Brooke Axtell, 34, took the stage and spoke directly to domestic violence victims, urging them to seek help. She shared the story of her own abusive relationship which followed a traumatic childhood.

The Austin-based writer was sold for sex to other men by her nanny whose care she was under while her mother Mollie was in hospital and her father Calvin was traveling for work.

Miss Axtell is a singer-songwriter, poet and activist along with communications director for Allies Against Slavery, a nonprofit that fights against human trafficking.

Miss Axtell was cared for by a number of nannies before being looked after by a man she called 'Jim', who was training to be a priest.

In an essay in 2012, entitled What I Know of Silence, Miss Axtell shared the horrifying details of how she was sexually abused by Jim at the age of seven.

She wrote: 'Jim tied me up and called me a whore. He gave me to other men who pay to rape little girls and film it for their private pornography collections.'

Miss Axtell wrote that she was confined to a basement in chains, where was raped and filmed.

Even when her ordeal ended, she didn't report Jim because of the shame she felt about what she had suffered, according to Washington Post.  

Miss Axtell never told anyone what had happened to her and later found herself in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend. 

At the beginning of her speech at the Grammys in Los Angeles on Sunday, Miss Axtell, who is unmarried, said: 'I am a survivor of domestic violence. After a year of passionate romance with a handsome, charismatic man, I was stunned when he began to abuse me.

'I believed he was lashing out because he was in pain, and needed help. I believed my compassion could restore him and our relationship. My empathy was used against me. I was terrified of him and ashamed I was in this position.

'What bound me to him was my desire to heal him. My compassion was incomplete because it did not include me. When he threatened to kill me, I knew I had to escape. I revealed the truth to my mom and she encouraged me to seek help at a local domestic violence shelter. This conversation saved my life.'

She added: 'Authentic love does not devalue another human being. Authentic love does not silence, shame or abuse.

'If you're in a relationship with someone who does not honor or respect you, I want you to know you are worthy of love. Please reach out for help.' 

Miss Axtell finally told her mother about the abuse after her boyfriend threatened to kill her. 

Her mother, Mollie O'Meara Axtell, helped her get in contact with a shelter. 

The 34-year-old went on to found Survivor Healing and Empowerment (S.H.E.), a group which supports survivors of rape, abuse and sex-trafficking.

She is also a spokeswoman for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) and works with a domestic violence shelter in her hometown of Austin. 

Miss Axtell has also won the Phyllis Smart Young Prize for Poetry and published several books of poetry.

She has also produced three albums and performed with British pop star Dido and drummer, Terry Bozzio (who played with Frank Zappa). 

The multi-talented artist has also worked with with Bob Dylan's guitarist Charlie Sexton and Mitch Watkins (guitarist for Leonard Cohen and Lyle Lovett).

But it was through her activist work, that Miss Axtell drew the attention of the executive producer of the Grammys, Ken Ehrlich.

She penned a powerful message for the Grammys  to highlight violence during the ceremony. She didn't know that she would be appearing alongside Katy Perry until last week.

Miss Axtell said that Perry's choice of song may have been because of similar experiences in her life.

'I think it's clear from the song that she is choosing to perform that she has had an experience in her life where she felt very devastated by a relationship, and I think that's her entry-point into this,' she said. 

However the activist insisted Perry had never confirmed that specifically.

In an interview with Slate Magazine this weekend, Miss Axtell said sexual abuse before the age of 18 is a major factor in being vulnerable to domestic violence.    

'I wanted to find a balance between sharing the reality of my own trauma but also to emphasize that there is a path to freedom, and to offer a call to action: to encourage women in this position to value their own lives and their voices and reach out for help,' she told the magazine. 

'I know last year they addressed the issue of gay marriage [when Macklemore performed Same Love while Queen Latifah officiated a mass wedding of gay and straight couples]. This year they wanted it to be the issue of violence against women.' 

Asked about what she would think about on stage, she told the magazine: 'I’ll be thinking of the survivors I’ve worked with over the years. I know if I speak from that place, I’ll be very peaceful and very clear. I’ll try not to focus on the fact that Beyonce and Madonna and Lady Gaga are sitting right there. And I won’t be wearing a shark costume [referring to Perry's Super Bowl halftime performance.'  

Miss Axtell spoke after President Obama made an appearance via a pre-recorded video, stating nearly one in five women in the U.S. has been a victim of rape or attempted rape and one in four women has experienced domestic violence.

Obama urged viewers to back the White House's anti-domestic violence campaign ItsOnUs.

'It's not OK and it has to stop,' Obama said. 'Artists have a unique power to change minds and attitudes and getting us talking and thinking about what matters.

'And to the artists at the Grammys tonight, I ask you to ask your fans to do it too,' he added. 

The hashtag #ItsOnUs began trending within minutes on Twitter. 

My name is Brooke Axtell and I am a survivor of domestic violence. After a year of passionate romance with a handsome, charismatic man, I was stunned when he began to abuse me.

I believed he was lashing out because he was in pain, and needed help. I believed my compassion could restore him and our relationship. My empathy was used against me. I was terrified of him and ashamed I was in this position.

Authentic love does not devalue another human being. Authentic love does not silence, shame, or abuse. If you are in a relationship with someone who does not honor or respect you, I want you to know that you are worthy of love. 

Please reach out for help. Your voice will save you. Let it extend into the night. Let it part the darkness. Let it set you free to know who you truly are. Valuable. Beautiful. Loved.
