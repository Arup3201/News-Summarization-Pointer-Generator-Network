The search for a cure for dementia is being hampered by ‘funding fatigue’, a major report warns.

Donors and drug firms are becoming more ‘conservative’ following a string of ‘repeated and costly failures’, said the report by the dementia forum of the World Innovation Summit for Health (Wish).

Just three drugs for Alzheimer’s gained approval between 1998 and 2012 and without a major breakthrough dementia will become a ‘global economic crisis’, it says.

The report highlighted new sources of funding including private investment from industry. 

The move was welcomed by British charities including Alzheimer’s Research UK. Dr James Pickett, of the Alzheimer’s Society, called for a ‘massive step change’ in research funding.

More than 100 potential drugs for Alzheimer’s disease failed to live up to initial promise between 1998 and 2012, the report says.

Just three drugs gained approval for treating the symptoms of the disease during that time - it has been 12 years since the last treatment was licensed in the UK.

The report claims a succession of ‘repeated and costly failures’ have created ‘funding fatigue’ among donors and drug manufacturers. 

Major drug companies halved the number of research programmes into central nervous system disorders, which includes dementia, between 2009 and 2014, the report said.

Experts said that with no known cure and a huge increase in cases expected within a decade, ‘a massive step change in research funding’ was needed.

Dementia research has been relatively neglected for research funding compared with other major diseases such as cancer.

The report was presented at Wish 2015, a gathering of health experts in Doha, Qatar. Wish is an initiative of the Qatar Foundation, the charitable organisation linked to the Gulf state’s ruling al-Thani family.

Its executive chair is the former Labour health minister Lord Darzi who said the social and economic burden of dementia was already clear.

He said ‘Yet the future costs to societies and economies will be enormous without significant intervention now.’

The Wish report says there has been speculation among experts that ‘repeated and costly failures in drug development have created funding fatigue in donors and pharmaceutical companies.

‘They believe this has caused the field to become more conservative, and limited unconventional strategies and parallel drug discovery opportunities.’

The report sets out a range of potential new funding options for dementia research, including attracting private investment from industry and high net worth individuals.

Dementia affects over 830,000 people in the UK and costs the UK economy £23bn a year.

Alzheimer’s Research UK, the world’s largest dedicated dementia research charity, earlier this week announced a £30m Drug Discovery Alliance to buck the trend by using academic resources.

It has launched three flagship Drug Discovery Institutes at the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford and UCL (University College London).

The Drug Discovery Institutes will see 90 new research scientists employed in state-of-the-art facilities to fast-track the development of new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.

Hilary Evans, Director of External Affairs at Alzheimer’s Research UK, the UK’s leading dementia research charity, said the number affected by dementia in the UK is expected to exceed 1 million by 2025.

‘Yet we currently lack treatments capable of tackling the diseases that cause it.

‘If we are to find ways of tackling diseases like Alzheimer’s and transform people’s lives, we must work together, increase investment and galvanise research efforts’ she said.

Dr Pickett added said: ‘With no known cure, limited treatments, and a projected prevalence of one million within the decade, we need a massive step change in research funding in order to develop new treatments.’

He said that public-private partnerships designed to share the risk of investment had potential for future funding of research.

The UK Government has taken a leading role in the global fight against dementia.

London hosted the world’s first Dementia Summit in 2013, where the Prime Minister pledged to double the country’s research funding for dementia to £66m in 2015.
