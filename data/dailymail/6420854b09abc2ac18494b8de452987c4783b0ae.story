'He is having a great time, playing great football, nobody is indifferent to what he is doing and I think he should be on that list.

'I do not know what will happen, but it would be something fantastic for him and I would be delighted.’

Former Sporting Lisbon centre back Rojo also revealed Nani, who switched positions with the Argentine by sealing a loan move to the Portuguese capital, is being tracked by Manchester United's coaching staff.

Rojo added: 'The people here at Manchester United are always asking me about Nani.

'[They are asking] if he score goals, whether he's playing regularly and playing well in that position. They are very attentive to the work of Nani.'
