Champion boxer Joseph Selkirk has escaped jail after admitting assaulting his girlfriend

Champion boxer Joseph Selkirk has escaped jail after admitting assaulting his girlfriend - Bollywood actress Amy Jackson.

The European light-middleweight title holder, 28, originally denied pushing the Bollywood superstar to the ground during a row at the Malmaison hotel in Liverpool on November 8 2013.

He vowed to fight any allegations after being charged but pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on March 17.

The court heard Malmaison staff became concerned when the couple pulled up in silver Mercedes car and appeared to be having a heated row.

Selkirk had been celebrating a win at a boxing match that night and they’d both been drinking.

The hotel night porter revealed he saw Selkirk push Ms Jackson, 23, as she tried to get out of the car.

The argument continued as the pair entered the hotel.

The porter also said he heard Selkirk referred to his model and actress girlfriend as a 'skank', and as the couple left, the porter saw Selkirk use his open palm to push Ms Jackson causing her to stumble on the hotel steps.

When the police were called Ms Jackson was said to be holding her jaw and wincing in pain.

Selkirk, who is said to now be living in Spain, has been given a 12-month community order and ordered to pay £300 costs.

Ms Jackson was not willing to pursue the case but the Crown Prosecution Service decided that a prosecution was necessary and was in the public interest.

Angie Rowan, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'Selkirk is a boxing champion and an assault by him would clearly have a substantial impact.

'There were witnesses to what had happened in the early hours of 8 November and they were definite about what they had seen happen between the couple.

'Victims of domestic violence often don’t want to pursue a complaint because they’re frightened of reprisals or are worried about the impact it will have on their families.

'However, the Crown Prosecution Service is determined to bring these cases to court wherever possible in the interests of the public as a whole.'
