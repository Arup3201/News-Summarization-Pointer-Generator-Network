Tottenham are monitoring developments with Everton midfielder James McCarthy.

The Republic of Ireland man did not travel with the club to Hull on New Year's Day as he protects his hamstring injury. However, clubs have become aware that he has grown frustrated following the lack of talks over a revised contract.

The 24-year-old only joined Everton from Wigan in 2013 for £13million and signed a five year deal. It is understood that was linked with incentives and Roberto Martinez has since hinted that he would discuss new terms with the player to reward his performances.

McCarthy has been pivotal to Martinez's style and has been one of Everton's most consistent performers. His troublesome hamstring injury has been sorely felt by the team as well as the player this season. His importance has been widely recognised by team-mates and other Premier League clubs have taken keen notice.

Arsenal wanted to buy him in January and were willing to go to £20m but they are wary Everton will refuse all offers and don't want to become engaged in a saga hence looking at other targets. Tottenham have similar reservations but like the player and will see how events develop.

Head of recruitment Paul Mitchell was a big admirer of McCarthy during his time at Southampton and watched the midfielder regularly while he was playing for Wigan. Tottenham are in the process of re-shaping their squad and are looking to offload midfielders but believe McCarthy would fit into Mauricio Pochettino's pressing style should he be willing to make the move.

Arsenal, meanwhile, have had an opening offer for Legia Warsaw midfielder Krystian Bielik rejected. The 16-year-old also has an offer from Roma.

Arsene Wenger has made a bid to bring Krystian Bielik to the Emirates, but it was rebuffed

Real Madrid are showing an interest in Wilfried Bony.

The Swansea striker is a target for Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham. City have played down their chances of signing the Ivory Coast star but it is understood the club's hierarchy are keen on a £25m transfer.

Madrid are scouring Europe for potential new strikers to back up Karim Benzema while rumours also persist that the Frenchman may yet move on in the summer. Javier Hernandez is also expected to return to Manchester United from his loan at Madrid where he has scored four goals in 13 appearances.

Madrid are also favourites to sign Marco Reus from Borussia Dortmund although Chelsea, Manchester United and City remain interested.

Arsenal and Liverpool have checked on Villarreal striker Luciano Vietto.

The 21-year-old was offered to Leicester City for £3.5m last summer but they were unsure about taking a gamble on a young forward from Racing Club who was untried in the English leagues.

The Argentina U20 forward, who is looked after by Diego Maradona's former agent Jorge Cyterszpiler, has scored six goals in his last six games and is now rated in the £12m bracket after helping propel Villarreal to fifth in La Liga.

Liverpool scouts are looking for forwards who fit into their profile of being quick, technically good and able to play a pressing game.

Their budget at this stage means a loan is more likely for January if anything with permanent deals shelved until the summer.

Villarreal would be reluctant to sell Vietto in January unless clubs made an inflated offer.

Chelsea expect Inter Milan to resume talks over a loan deal for Mohamed Salah over the coming days.

Inter want a loan with view to a £12m deal for the Egyptian but have also asked about taking Xherdan Shaqiri from Bayern Munich. They expect Shaqiri to choose Juventus although Liverpool have also been asked if they wish to revive interest in the Switzerland star.

Chelsea are awaiting news on their bid for Andrej Kramaric. HNK Rijeka's officials are in Dubai and will return to Croatia on Sunday. They want Chelsea to increase their offer for Kramaric while Chelsea will then decide whether to loan him to Leicester or Vitesse.

Liverpool's highly-rated defender Lloyd Jones has signed for Cheltenham Town on loan and will be joined by team-mates Kevin Stewart and Jack Dunn.

Jones, 19, was initially signed from Plymouth and is tipped to make a breakthrough at centre-back while Stewart, 21, a former trainee with Tottenham, is a full back who can play either side. Dunn, 20, can play across the forward line.

Martin Odegaard spent last Thursday training with Manchester United at Carrington before visiting Manchester City but the growing belief is that Ajax may have persuaded him that they could be his best option. 

Their youth system is renowned and guarantees a quickfire progression into the first team. Odegaard and his father are considering, understandably, whether moves to bigger clubs would stagnate his progress. 

He is already playing in the first team and is a Norway international at 16. Bayern Munich had been considered favourites to sign him.

Martin Odegaard visited Manchester United and Manchester City last week as the Stromsgodset youngster chooses which club to join. Ajax are also interested in the youngster.
