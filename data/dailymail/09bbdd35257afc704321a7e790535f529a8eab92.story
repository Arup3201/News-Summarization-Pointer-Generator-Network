World number three Sergio Garcia intends to copy Paul McGinley's winning formula if he ever becomes Europe's Ryder Cup captain.

McGinley has received widespread praise for his methods after overseeing Europe's latest victory over the United States at Gleneagles.

McGinley made much of his captaincy template in the build-up and during the event itself and Garcia, who scored 2.5 points in the 16.5-11.5 victory, believes it was a near-perfect blueprint.

The 34-year-old Spaniard said: 'They say perfection doesn't exist, but if perfection doesn't exist then he has been as close as you can get to it.

'I think he has done a great job and I have learned a lot from him.

'Hopefully, one year, in the long-term future, I can bring some of his thoughts into my captaincy. It would be great, it was amazing.'

Europe dominated the 40th edition of the biennial contest in Perthshire.

They led 5-3 after the first day, 10-6 after the second and then prevailed on Sunday thanks to impressive singles performances from the likes of Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Martin Kaymer.

Garcia, who also won his singles contest against Jim Furyk, felt the whole week at Gleneagles Hotel was a success from start to finish.

'We always have such amazing teams,' he said. 'The chemistry we have between us is just amazing.

'I just feel so honoured and proud to be part of it. I couldn't think of nicer teams to be around in the team room, not only the players but the captain and vice-captains, the wives, everybody.'

While for Garcia the victory was a fifth in seven Ryder Cup appearances, for Lee Westwood it was a seventh from nine.

Westwood, who claimed two points with two foursomes victories to move to fourth on the all-time European points list, said: 'It's incredible. I'd love it to be every week. I'm sure I'd get tired but I'd love it every week. The European Ryder Cup team is dominant at the moment.'

Westwood was also impressed with every aspect of McGinley's camp.

'I couldn't pick a fault with any point during the week,' the 41-year-old said.
