Harry Kane is 'loving every minute' right now as the Tottenham striker prepares to meet up with England for the first time buoyed by a maiden Premier League hat-trick.

The 21-year-old's scarcely-believable rise continues apace, with the Chingford-born forward making it 29 goals in all competitions with his treble against Leicester on Saturday.

Kane's performance helped inspire out-of-sorts Tottenham to a 4-3 win and saw him move top of the top-flight scoring charts - a remarkable feat considering the first of 19 league goals did not arrive until November 2.

It capped a whirlwind few days for the striker, who on Sunday is meeting up with the England senior squad for the first time ahead of the matches with Lithuania and Italy.

'I can't wait,' Kane said. 'It has been a dream to be called up but obviously I want to go and play.

'There is great competition for places and hopefully I can just do my best whilst I am away and see what happens.

'(I want to play for England) like any boy would. That's what I want to do.

'There is great competition and I have to keep working hard if I want to get a place in the team.'

Kane insists he is able to savour such moments, despite so many things coming 'thick and fast'.

It is form he wants to keep up and, as much as he wants to impress for England, retains a focus on club matters.

Saturday's win kept Spurs' hopes of a top-four finish alive and was the perfect response to their insipid display in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester United.

'Obviously we all know that was a poor game from us,' Kane said, speaking to Sky Sports. 'There is no hiding away from that, but it is how you react.

'I've always said we've got a great bunch of lads here and again we've proved that. We've come back with a great win today.

'We have got a great squad, we all enjoy it. We're loving every minute, obviously we want to keep the wins coming and see how far we can get up the table.'

The emotions those connected to Leicester are feeling could not be much different.

The Foxes are seven points from safety with only nine matches left after the harsh defeat in north London.

City's performance belied that of a side rock-bottom of the standings and manager Nigel Pearson praised his players' character afterwards.

'It's a very disappointing result for us because I think we deserved more,' he said. 'I don't think we deserved to be on the receiving end of a defeat today.

'To be 2-0 down after 13 minutes and really stretch one of the top sides away from home all the way to the end is a measure of the commitment that the players have shown today.

'To a man I thought they were really excellent in terms of how they went about trying to win the game.'
