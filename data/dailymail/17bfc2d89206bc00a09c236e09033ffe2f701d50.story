Arrest made: Three-year-old Tharell Edward was shot in the head early Saturday morning and police suspect a family acquaintance of pulling the trigger

A man has been arrested after a Brooklyn, New York toddler was shot in the head while sleeping in his crib early Saturday morning.

Three-year-old Tharell Edward is in stable condition, recovering at Cornell Medical Center after being shot yesterday.

Police have arrested 22-year-old Akeem Bernard, a family acquaintance, on six charges related to the shooting including criminal possession of a weapon, assault and endangering the welfare of a child.

According to police, Tharell's mother Nichelle Edward, 43, was not around when the shooting happened.

Instead she left him with a woman her neighbors say is her roommate.

The roommate invited Bernard over that night to their Ditmas Park apartment. Around 3:30am gunfire was heard and Bernard came to the roommate with Tharell in her arms.

Bernard claimed that the shots came from outside.

But police aren't buying his story. They say that the bullet holes are only seen on his story and not in the windows.

The weapon was never found, so they are also charging Bernard for tampering with evidence by possibly getting rid of it.

Bernard has retained a lawyer and has not made any statements so far.

A three-year-old boy is in a critical condition after being shot in the head in the early hours of Saturday morning

Neighbors said the young boy has had to endure a tough start to his young life.

Several months ago he was left seriously injured when a pit bull owned by his mother's boyfriend attacked him.

According to neighbors the boy is called Terrell and his mother is 40-year-old Nitchell Edwards

'She's very irresponsible, very neglectful,' neighbor Tony Reid told the New York Daily News.

'She had a dog that bit the baby and when the baby came back from the hospital the child fell down the staircase that week. Twice that week.'

The child was rushed to Kings County Hospital, where he was initially listed in critical condition early Saturday.

He was later transferred to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and then to Cornell Medical Center, where he is listed in critical but stable condition.
