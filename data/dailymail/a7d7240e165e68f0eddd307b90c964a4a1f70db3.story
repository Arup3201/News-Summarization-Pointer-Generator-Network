Bad cop ... but best dad?  

An Illinois police officer is currently under investigation for allegedly going outside his jurisdiction and using his emergency lights to pull over a school bus - all because his teenage son forgot his lunch.

The curious traffic stop occurred about 7am Tuesday in Johnsburg, McHenry County. 

Lt. Brian Keller was in an unmarked black Dodge Charger at the time.

Investigation: Cop Brian Keller used his unmarked black Dodge Charger to stop a bus and deliver his son's lunch in Johnsburg, Illinois, on Tuesday morning

He pulled over the bus about nine miles from Marion Central Catholic High School in Woodstock.

The bus was transporting high school students at the time.

Keller is said to have gotten out of his vehicle and onto the bus, given his son lunch, and then told the bus it could carry on. 

The traffic stop appears to have startled the driver of the bus, who filed a police complaint over the incident.

'The apparent purpose of the stop was to issue his son his lunch for the day,' the complaint read, according to The Chicago Tribune.

'The complainant was advised that documentation would be made, however, she needed to contact (the Lake County Sheriff’s Office) regarding the incident.'

Lake County Undersheriff Raymond Rose said the complaint was currently under investigation.

'We received information regarding allegations of inappropriate actions by Lt. Brian Keller,' Rose told the Tribune.

'As a result of that, Sheriff (Mark) Curran and I have ordered an internal investigation into the allegations.'

Keller is a former chief at the Lake County sheriff's department.

However he recently transferred to a new position as a lieutenant working in court security.
