Everton fear they will be without Kevin Mirallas for at least four weeks after he suffered a hamstring tear in Saturday’s Merseyside derby.

The Belgium forward pulled up after just 30 minutes of the game and early signs are not good.

Manager Roberto Martinez said afterwards: ‘It seems bad. It’s a hamstring. We’re going to assess him in the next 24 hours.

‘Kevin has been in great form and we’ve got a lot of games coming up. It’s very unfortunate for us.’

Mirallas has scored three goals for Everton so far this season.

Further tests are planned today to establish the severity of the tear but Everton and the Belgium national team doctor expect him to be out for a minimum of four weeks.
