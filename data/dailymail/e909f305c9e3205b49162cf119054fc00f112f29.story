A school nurse accused of failing to properly raise the alarm after meeting a 'tormented' teenager three times in the month before her suicide has been charged with professional misconduct. 

Donna Barbara Moore is said to have had several chances to assess 15-year-old Helena Farrell before the gifted pupil hanged herself in a woodland area near her home in Cumbria on January 4 last year. 

The nurse, who worked at Kirkbie Kendal School, where Helena was a student, has claimed that initially she 'didn't see the risk' that the tragic pupil would end her own life - despite the girl's extremely distressed state.

Several accusations have now been brought against her - for which she must appear at the Old Bailey on September 1.

In all of her time with Helena, it is alleged that she failed to refer her case to children's services or complete a safeguarding profile of the teenager - recording her deep issues.

When Helena attempted suicide on December 4 2013 - one month before her death - by taking an overdose, the nurse allegedly failed to make a referral to Cumbria Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in a reasonable period of time - namely between 24 and 48 hours.

This and other factors meant Helena did not get an appointment with a social worker from CAMHS until January 3 - the day before her death - where she was deemed as not posing an imminent risk to herself.

The inquest in July at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard Helena was a ‘bright, intelligent, adventurous and fun-loving’ girl who was a gifted cellist and singer

During an inquest in July, Ms Moore spoke about her early meetings with Helena, saying: 'I asked her if she had thoughts about ending her life. She said "no, not really, I just feel up and down". At the time I didn't see the risk then.'

Her alleged oversight was one of many apparent failings in the lead up to Helena's death.

The teenager was academically very able and gifted in sports and music, playing hockey and also attending the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester.

In the months before her suicide she had become depressed after splitting up with a boyfriend and had self-harmed on several occasions.

She had even written letters saying goodbye to her family and friends in the weeks leading up to her death - but they were confiscated by a teacher and later binned. 

Helena's parents, Enda & Maria Farrell, speak at the end of the inquest into their daughter's death

On January 4, the former Windermere School pupil was found hanged in woodland behind the Castle Green Hotel, Kendal - with Coldplay song The Scientist playing on repeat in the background.

July's inquest into the death concluded that Helena died 'as a consequence of her own actions'.

However the coroner at the inquest criticised the school nursing system after hearing that Donna Moore had responsibility at the time for the welfare of around 5,000 pupils across five secondary schools and at least 20 primary schools.

The CAMHS have also come under heavy criticism for failing to offer Helena an appointment with a social worker until her mother, Maria, called them - despite the case being classed as 'urgent'.

Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement: 'We have conducted a confidential investigation into Donna Moore's conduct and await the outcome of the NMC hearing.'

Helena is said to have become deeply depressed after splitting up with a boyfriend towards the end of 2012

Helena was said to be an extremely gifted student - after her death her parents said 'this unbearable tragedy has profoundly changed our lives'

A Serious Case Review by Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board, part of Cumbria County Council, was published shortly after Helena's inquest, criticising child mental health care in the county.

Helena's parents, Enda and Maria Farrell, have called for changes to the way the services are funded, organised and run.

They said earlier this year: 'This unbearable tragedy has profoundly changed our lives.'
