Halloween is still over a week away, but a contender for the year's most inappropriate costume has already arrived: Ray Rice dragging the limp body of the wife he'd just beaten into unconsciousness.

Photos of the stunt showed up on Reddit Sunday in a forum reserved for taboo and tasteless humor called Too Soon.

However, commenters elsewhere quickly agreed that anytime was too soon for the the costume, photos of which were first posted by Redditor AL0311 along with the caption:

'Ladies were falling for my friends Ray Rice costume.' 

Sick: Halloween is still over a week away, but a contender for the year's most inappropriate costume has already arrived--Ray Rice dragging the limp body of the wife he'd just beaten into unconsciousness

Not funny: The man drags around the blowup doll, meant to be Rice's wife Janay, and friends were amused enough to post the photos online

In the photos, a man in the Baltimore Ravens running back's jersey is seen dragging around a blowup doll in a long, dark wig.

In one pic, he smiles for the camera as he grabs the doll's hair.

While commenters in the Reddit forum have largely accepted the costume as just a funny gag, readers on Buzzeed, Barstool Sports and UpRoxx have put the wheels of internet justice in motion with cries of outrage over the 'sick,' 'despicable' and 'contemptuous.'

Shocking abuse: Footage taken inside the Revel casino in Atlantic City show Rice bashing his wife in the head with a horrific left hook

Insult to injury: After he knocked her out cold, Rice dragged his wife's limp body out of the casino elevator

The domestic abuse the costume is made to mock took place in Atlantic City in February and shows Ricen, 27, and his wife Janay in an elevator of the now-shuttered Revel casino.

With one powerful left hook, Rice knocks his wife unconscious and she crumples to the ground.

The events turn all the more sickening when Rice is shown dragging Janay's limp body from the elevator, an act the Halloween jokester mimicked with the inflatable doll over the weekend.

Rice is currently under indefinite suspension from the Ravens. His wife has spoken publicly in support of her husband.
