In her former life as a party planner, some said her advice verged on the blindingly obvious.

But now she has reinvented herself as a fitness instructor, Pippa Middleton’s keep-fit tips are more unusual.

The 31-year-old has advised her followers to feast on beetroot and invest in a pair of padded Lycra shorts to achieve her toned physique.

She even shared her favourite healthy recipe, a ‘pre-dinner canapé of beetroot fritters topped with cream cheese and smoked salmon’, which she said comes in at just 47 calories each.

Writing in her new monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine, she said she has recently developed a passion for cycling that has helped keep her famous toned behind in perfect shape.

Miss Middleton – who was dubbed Her Royal Hotness ever since she appeared as a bridesmaid at her sister’s wedding to the Duke of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011 – even shared four ‘strength work’ exercises to help her fans keep up in the saddle.

And she has put her new found athleticism to good use. In June, she completed a 3,000 charity bike race across the United States along with her brother James. 

She admitted she initially found the sport ‘intimidating’ as her experience before that was limited to ‘winding along country lanes on a dusty old mountain bike, most likely en route to a pub lunch’.

But with the right preparation and equipment, she was soon hooked: ‘With a basic fitness level, I found you can get bike fit in a matter of months with a combination of core Pilates exercises, spin classes and time on the road in the evenings or at weekends on quieter off-road routes.’

Pippa Middleton gives out some keep-fit tips

Pippa Middleton said of her new passion: 

‘Cycling uses muscles differently from the way in which they’re used in other sports I enjoy, like running.

'I had to retrain my body with core exercises and explosive moves to get bike fit.’ 

JUMP SQUAT

Builds lower body power

Drop down into a squat, feet hip-width apart (A). Press through your heels to jump into the air (B). Land in the squat position to reset. Do three sets of 10 jumps.

FRONT PLANK

Great for core strength

Start in a push-up position and lower yourself down onto your forearms. Brace your abs, squeeze your glutes and hold for 30 seconds. Do three sets.

GLUTE PLANK

Fires the glutes – the powerhouse for cyclists.

Start in a front plank position with your abs engaged (A). Lift and lower one leg at a time (B), keeping your hips level. DO three sets of 10.

PLANK ROTATION

Strengthens obliques

Start in a side plank on your left forearm, feet stacked, right arm up (A). Rotate it under the body (B), keeping your hips up. Repeat for 10 and swich sides. Do three sets of 20.

Miss Middleton advised her disciples to be ‘minimalist’ with their kit, but added: ‘In terms of bike essentials, it’s all about making your experience more enjoyable.

‘In my case that meant getting a gel-padded seat and cushioned Lycra shorts, gloves, a bike computer to gauge speed, lights, hi-vis jacket and some good glasses to protect eyes from stones.’

Advising her readers to ‘use real food for energy rather than relying on sugary bars’, she revealed her secret beetroot

She added: ‘With this in mind, my chosen food this month is beetroot, which is great for energy because new science suggests it opens up the blood vessels, increasing blood flow to muscles.’

In 2012, Miss Middleton’s party planning book Celebrate was ridiculed for including elementary advice on how to play conkers and how to create a Halloween ghost using a white sheet and a bamboo cane.
