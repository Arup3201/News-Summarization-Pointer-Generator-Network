Police have called for witnesses to help them put someone who allegedly unknowingly filmed women in the shower, on the train and licked the back of neck behind bars.

A 38-year-old has been in custody since a court appearance in January, and was charged with 17 counts of filming person's private parts without consent, trespassing, peep and pry and acts of indecency.

Ryde Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Richard Puffett said police are now trying to identify the victims, and potential witnesses.

Police have called for witnesses to help them put someone who allegedly unknowingly filmed women in the shower, on the train and licked the back of neck 

'Some of the images include 'up-skirting'; peep and pry where people have been filmed in their own homes showering; women travelling on trains where another passenger has allegedly licked the back of their heads; and the reactions of women to an act of indecency,' Det Insp Puffett said. 

It is believed one victim is aged under 16. 

A property in Sydney's north was raided last December, which resulted in the seizure of a GoPro camera and a number of electronic storage devices.

The storage devices show acts of peep and pry, voyeurism and 'up-skirting' conduct, along with acts of indecency, an indecent assault, and aggravated break and enter offences.

A 38-year-old has remained in custody since a court appearance in January, and was charged with 17 counts of filming person's private parts without consent, trespassing, peep and pry and acts of indecency

Police believe the footage comes from up to 40 different incidents.  

'The images were taken in Carlingford, Epping, Beecroft, Normanhurst and Thornleigh areas between October and December 2014,' Det Insp Puffett said.

'We have released two images of females; we believe they may have witnessed one of these incidents, or could have been a victim. We are hoping they may come forward and speak to police.'

The investigation is ongoing, with police calling on witnesses or victims to come forward to help.

The person was remanded to reappear in Parramatta Local Court on 12 March 2015.
