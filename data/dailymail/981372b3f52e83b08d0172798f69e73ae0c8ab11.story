 

Two New Jersey teenagers looking to make extra money shoveling driveways in the wake of storm Juno, were stopped by police for flouting the travel curfew.

Matt Molinari and Eric Schnepf had been passing out flyers offering to shovel snow in their local area when they were told by police their entrepreneurship was flouting the travel ban.

A neighbor in  Bridgewater, New Jersey, had called police and reported the two teenagers as 'suspicious', and when police came upon the two boys, an officer ordered them back inside.

The harsh weather affecting the east coast had seen New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declare a state of emergency and imposing a travelling ban on all non-emergency vehicles.

Mr Molinari and Mr Schnepf effectively flouted the ban on they drive around the neighbourhood while trying to make some pocket money in the wake of the storm.

'The roads were fine enough to go out and drive,' Mr Schnepf told NBC New York, saying he had 'no idea' there was a travel ban in place.

Local Police Chief Michael Jannone explained that the teenagers were stopped and questioned but were only told to go back inside and resume their business once the  the state of emergency was lifted.

However, despite the innocent concern for the two teenager's safety, news of the incident spread quickly on social media, where a large number of people suggested that 'you can't even shovel driveways without a permit anymore,'

Police Chief Jannone denies this, saying that he made it clear to Mr Molinari and Mr Schnepf that they were more than welcome to offer their services in the community once the travel ban had been lifted the next day.

Gov. Chris Christie lifted the New Jersey travelling ban at 7:30am on Tuesday.

The state-wide restrictions were put in place on Monday night to aid plowing.
