From children to high-flying businesses executives, fold-up scooters are a popular way to get around town quickly, but they're often bulky and awkward to carry. 

Now there’s a new design of scooter that's so tiny, it folds up to the size of an A4 piece of paper.

A university student created the award-winning scooter by linking pieces of aluminium with a cable, which when tightened, pull them together to support an adult’s weight.

The scooter was designed by London-based student George Mabey. It works by linking parts of aluminium with a cable which, when tightened, pull them together to support an adult's weight. At its smallest, the scooter (pictured) is approximately 8-inches wide and 11-inches tall - the same size as an A4 piece of paper

The scooter folds down to the size of an A4 piece of paper.

It is so small it can fit in a rucksack or handbag.

The lightweight scooter weighs less than 11lbs (5kg) and will be on display at an exhibition at London South Bank University from Saturday.

There are no immediate plans to release the scooter.

In fact, George Mabey’s design is so small it can fit inside a handbag, and could go on sale soon.

The 22-year-old from Southampton recently won the top prize at the Power of Aluminium Awards, which celebrates innovative uses of the metal.

His scooter weighs less than 11lbs (5kg) and has gone on show at London South Bank University as part of its Product Design and Engineering Product Design degree show.

The product (pictured) recently won the top prize at the Power of Aluminium Awards, which celebrates innovative uses of the metal. Mabey picked up his award at a ceremony hosted by the Aluminium Federation, and held at the Houses of Parliament

The scooter (pictured) will be a lightweight alternative to the current foldable bikes used by commuters

Just like a conventional scooter, it 
measures 37 inches (95cm) in height when fully extended, but folds up to
 a tiny 11.7inches (29.7cm) in length and 8.3inches (21cm) in width when
 collapsed – exactly the same size as a sheet of A4 paper.

‘The
 innovative design will fetch a premium price on the market,’ said Alan 
Arthur, marketing and communications executive at the Aluminium 
Federation.

‘Nothing else out there at the moment folds away this small and it could even fit in a handbag.

‘Aluminium weighs a third of steel and now Jaguar and Land Rover cars are made from the metal.

‘Based on some of the premium fold-away bikes, like Brompton Bicycles, this product will sell for several times that of a standard scooter - so up to and over £1,000.’

George picked up his award and prize of £1,000 at the ceremony, which was hosted by the Aluminium Federation and held at the Houses of Parliament.

Mabey said: ‘Having my work acknowledged at the awards and recognised by the industry is the icing on the cake. It’s a great way to finish my time at university.’

Simon MacVicker, president of the Aluminium Federation who hosted the awards, added: ‘This year’s awards have really demonstrated the immense talent among young people. The creativity is outstanding.’
