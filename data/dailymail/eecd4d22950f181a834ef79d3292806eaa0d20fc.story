The crisis in Ukraine 'would have been different' if Mitt Romney had been elected president, according to a former Republican Virginia governor.

President Barack Obama, said Jim Gilmore, is sacrificing America's national security on the altar of rank partisanship, blaming Republican-led cuts in the rate of spending growth for new limits on America's involvement abroad.

'He's satisfying himself with "Well, I have to scale back our safety because of you, because of your sequester,"' Gilmore told MailOnline, referring to a series of Defense Department budget cuts put in place as a dicey solution to a congressional budget stalemate in 2012.

'That's politics. That's not national leadership. He seems to be using partisanship as his excuse for a reduction of our national security and safety.'

Jim Gilmore. Former governor of Virginia, briefly ran for president himself in 2007, but now dishes out criticism about the White House's current occupant

Would Putin have flinched? Gilmore says Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's more aggressive foreign policy would likely have made the Russian president sit on his hands instead of invading Ukraine

Gilmore was Virginia's governor from 1998 to 2002 and now runs the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank that pushes for aggressive U.S. foreign policy.

He told MailOnline on Friday at the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference in Nashua, New Hampshire that Obama 'doesn't have a vision for the big-picture safety and security of this country.'

'He should have reversed course' after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Gilmore insisted.

If Obama had lost his re-election bid to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, he said, Putin would have been less bold.

'In all probability it would have been different' with Romney in charge, Gilmore told MailOnline, since Obama isn't believable overseas.

'He doesn't seem to have the experience himself, because of his background â€“ his limited time in the Senate, his previous background in Chicago,' he said. 'That doesn't give him any foreign policy experience.'

'Moral authority and military power is necessary to preserve our security in the 21st century. Perhaps Gov. Romney would have done that better.'

A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council responded to Gilmore's comments by referring MailOnline to interviews Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken gave Sunday on NBC and CNN.

Gilmore, no longer seeking any office, has become a GOP firebrand with a sharp tongue on foreign policy

Ukraine has sought urgent Western backing after Russian President Vladimir Putin is insisting that Crimea had the right to join his country even while shock troops have maintained a grip on the region's borders

Putin, fresh off the global luster of a successful Olympic Winter Games, has seized international attention by marching across Russia's western border, apparently not fearing a robust American response

Blinken said on CNN that Putin 'is not acting out of a position of strength. He's acting out of a position of weakness,' and claimed 'the international community [is] mobilized against the actions [Putin] has taken as a result of the president's leadership.'

On NBC he added that the 'result of the mobilized support is that the financial markets in Russia have hit lows, the ruble has hit a low. Investors
 are wondering whether to get involved in Russia because of the 
instability. And all of that is exacting a real cost and a real 
consequence.'

Gilmore said the U.S. should continue to press Russia with economic sanctions, but do a better job of protecting Eastern European countries that want to change their courses.

'We need to recognize that Eastern Europe wants to be Western, and it's our duty to engage them as publicly as we can,' he explained, 'and make sure that everyone understands that we're drawing a line here. Obama says he's drawing lines, of course, but they don't seem to mean much.'

'What's driving him seems to be this idea that we have to pull back and pull back and pull back,' Gilmore said.

'Our friends in the United Kingdom, our friends in Europe and Japan, they don't want to see that. They still count on a robust America to lead the world.'

Japan, the UK and the rest of Europe, said Gilmore, wants to see a strong America as a disincentive to Russia and other aggressive states

Obama 'doesn't seem to have the experience himself, because of his background,' to run an effective foreign policy, he said,
