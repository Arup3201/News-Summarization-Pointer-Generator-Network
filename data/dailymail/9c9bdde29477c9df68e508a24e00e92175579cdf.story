Amber Kirwan, 19, was stabbed more than 10 times and buried in a shallow grave

A convicted murderer who was released after 10 years in prison will spend the rest of his life behind bars after he was found guilty again for murdering a teenager and dumping her body in a shallow grave. 

Christopher Alexander Falconer killed Amber Kirwan, 19, who was last seen alive after leaving Dooly's pool hall in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, on October 9, 2011. 

Her remains were found a month later in a shallow grave in Heathbell, Pictou County.

Supreme Court Judge Nick Scaravelli sentenced Falconer, 31, to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 

The jury spent seven and a half hours deliberating before reaching a verdict. 

Miss Kirwan's mother, Marjorie Kirwan, wept as the sentence was read out. 

According to CBC News, crown attorney Bill Gorman said the Kirwan family will never recover from the death of Amber. 

Speaking after the case he said: 'Their sense of relief, I believe was palpable, this tragedy that I don't think they'll ever get past.

'Justice was done. The jury carefully and thoughtfully considered. They would have deliberated for the better part of a day and they got our message and they made their finding'.

Miss Kirwan's body and clothes were found in a shallow grave close to the home of Falconer's stepsister.

A bloody tank top with both Miss Kirwan and Falconer's DNA was found in his car. 

According to a medical examiner, Miss Kirwan was stabbed at least 10 times - mostly on her neck, upper back and through the heart. 

The court heard there was evidence to suggest Miss Kirwan put up a fight against her attacker despite having high levels of codeine in her body.

Falconer's defence lawyer Mike Taylor said he was not surprised by the verdict and that at this time his client did not intend to appeal.

Falconer pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1998 and was sentenced to life in prison.

He and another teenager killed taxi driver Robert Leblanc before joyriding in his cab.

The murder took place on Heathbell Road - the same road where Miss Kirwan's body was found. 

However, Falconer was released after serving more than 10 years for the murder of Mr Leblanc.
