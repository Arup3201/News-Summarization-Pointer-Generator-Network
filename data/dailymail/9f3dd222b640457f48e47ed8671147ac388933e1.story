Despite boasting world-class players James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao, Monaco’s average gate last season was 8,906 – fewer than MK Dons in League One.

Rodriguez, the leading scorer at this summer’s World Cup, has since escaped the empty spaces of the Principality with a £65million move to Real Madrid.

And If Falcao has his way, he’ll be next. Despite the trappings of Monaco – hot sunshine, low tax, you get the picture – he finds it soul-destroying to perform in front of meagre crowds, even when finishing runners-up in the French League to Paris St Germain.

Liverpool are reported to be keen and with super-agent Jorge Mendes directing operations and Brendan Rodgers still needing to fill the space vacated by Luis Suarez with a genuine A-lister, it could add up.

Certainly, Falcao has the quality and goals to be a hit at Anfield. Importantly, he also possesses the physical strength to succeed in the Premer League.

For him, hearing a rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone from thousands of Koppites will be a marked contrast to the wide gaps he encounters at the Stade Louis II.

Until a year ago, AS Monaco was best known for being the launchpad of Arsene Wenger’s career. The Frenchman even persuaded Glenn Hoddle to join him.

Last year, a new high-roller tried to recapture the magic. Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of Monaco, went on a huge spending spree and landed Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho from Porto for £60million.

Then he gazumped Manchester City and Chelsea to capture Falcao for £50million after the Colombian striker scored 32 goals in La Liga for Atletico Madrid.

But now the dream has turned sour for the 28-year-old striker who is getting to the age now where trophies are more important than an already-healthy bank balance.

VIDEO Falcao quiet over possible Madrid move 

The Colombian was devastated to miss the World Cup with a knee injury and is in no mood to tread water in the French Riviera for another 12 months.

Now back in action, he is aware of the interest from Liverpool, who were possibly less upset about missing out on Loic Remy because they knew Falcao was an option.

Manchester City have also been mentioned as a possible destination because of injury to Alvaro Negredo though the club have done nothing to encourage the link.

Former Rangers, AC Milan and England striker Mark Hateley, who won a French championship under Wenger, says working and living in Monaco is a surreal experience for a footballer.

‘In Milan, it was very intense, I couldn’t go shopping or to a restaurant without getting mobbed. Monaco was a different way of life, you could go for a stroll without anything,’ he said.

‘Boris Becker lived next door. Ayrton Senna was in the same apartment block. We got friendly with the royal family, and all the sportsmen would go out to lunch. The motor racing drivers wanted to be footballers and vice-versa!’

It all sounds idyllic in one sense but it hasn’t given Falcao enough professional pride. With debate about the Monaco tax laws and the importance of financial fair play, even the compensation of the sky-high salaries may soon be a thing of the past.

Falcao is a late developer which may help Liverpool who usually buy young.

He was 23 when he left South America for Europe and started in Portugal. He was in his mid-twenties before he played in one of the top leagues, for Atletico.

Waiting for his chance didn’t harm Falcao. He scored 52 goals in three seasons for Atletico and helped them win the Europa League and Copa del Rey in successive seasons.

Last summer, every big club owner in Europe wanted him, including Roman Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour.

On that occasion, he chose the trappings of Monaco. This time round, with his pal Rodriguez gone and strike partner Dimitar Berbatovn not known for doing his share of the workload, he’s tempted by the passion of the Premier League.
