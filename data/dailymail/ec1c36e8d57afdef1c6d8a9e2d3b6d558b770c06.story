This two-year-old boy was meant to be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

Doctors claimed little Nolan Rooms would never walk, roll, crawl or even swallow food and he would see life out as a vegetable.

But now he is remarkably defying the experts and slowly overcoming the debilitating symptoms of his cerebral palsy with the help of alternative therapies.

Two-year-old Nolan Rooms is slowly overcoming the debilitating symptoms of his cerebral palsy with the help of alternative therapies known as Vojta and therasuits

Nolan, who was born three and a half months premature in March 2012, was diagnosed with a severe form of the disorder soon after birth.

He spent two weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Townsville with his parents, Nicole and Christian, before he contracted both a blood and chest infection that caused him to lose about 40 percent of his brain cells.

'He lost brain cells mostly on the left hand side, which is responsible for motor skills... they said he will be a vegetable in a wheelchair,' Ms Rooms told Daily Mail Australia.

'They said he wouldn't even be able to hold his head up, swallow food or drink water.'

He started the alternative therapies on the Sunshine Coast when he was eight months old and his parents say he has improved immensely 

Prior to the Vojta therapy, Nolan couldn't sit up, roll over or even extend his limbs. But the two-year-old was able to reach out for a toy after just one week of treatment

But it took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince Nolan's parents he could defy the doctors.

His parents started to counteract the effects of his cerebral palsy with early intervention using alternative therapies. 

'In the first year he didn't develop at all. He couldn't roll over and I couldn't put him on his tummy because he went blue,' Ms Rooms said.

His parents, Nicole and Christian, then flew the two-year-old to the United States for two months to undergo extensive therapy

'He couldn't straighten his arms or unclench his fists. He couldn't move or do anything - his limbs started to slowly deform.'

Ms Rooms found a therapy called Vojta, which is popular in her native Germany. 

'We started when he was eight months old. We came to the Sunshine Coast from Townsville for one week to see the only Vojta therapist in Australia,' she said. 

'After one week, Nolan opened his hand for the first time and reached out for a toy. He rolled over three times and we thought that was a miracle.'

He spent three months battling in hospital after doctors told his parents he was unlikely to survive

The family moved to the Sunshine Coast soon after so Nolan could undergo the therapy everyday.

After hearing about another therapy available in America known as the 'therasuit', Nolan and his parents  spent two months overseas for treatment.

'When we brought him back from America… he could hold his head upright and the rolling became consistent. He also started commando crawling. It was just another miracle,' Ms Rooms said.

'For us he is becoming more and more mobile, so that means when you look at Nolan you can't immediately see he has cerebral palsy any more.

'Even the eating has changed. Before he could only eat liquid and he struggled putting weight on. Now, today he ate half my toast with avocado.'

'He can now see the world while sitting instead of laying flat on his back.'

Nolan has now started eating solid foods after surviving on a liquid diet because he couldn't swallow properly 

It took just one successful breast feeding attempt after a three month stint in hospital to convince Nolan's parents he could defy the doctors

Due to the therapy's success, the Rooms and five other families pitched in to hire a therapist from the US program to come to Australia for 10 weeks.

'The next step for Nolan is crawling on his arms and legs. He just wants to stand up and walk, but we need to teach him to use the right muscles first,' Ms Rooms said. 

'I think he will walk eventually, although I'm not sure if it will be with an aide. We know it will still take a long time, but he surprises us every single day.

'He does the therapy every day for three hours. If I went to the gym for that long, I would be narky and sore. But he does it with a smile, so it's just amazing.' 

His mum Nicole says she's hopeful Nolan will walk in the near future, but they are trying to teach him to use the right muscles first

Nolan undergoes three hours of therapy every day and his parents say the results have been remarkable

The two-year-old's family moved to the Sunshine Coast  so Nolan could undergo the therapy everyday

As for the doctors who said Nolan would not be able to move, Ms Rooms said they're gobsmacked.

'The doctors were very amazed. When we used to go to the doctors, they would just prescribe medication or equipment. But we were always against,' she said. 

'Now they keep saying, "whatever you’re doing keep doing it".'

Fellow Queenslander Blaise Wyatt, 3, has undergone the same therasuit treatment in the US. 

Diagnosed with cerebral palsy in 2010, Blaise has had similar success to Nolan - he can now roll over and sit up on his own.
