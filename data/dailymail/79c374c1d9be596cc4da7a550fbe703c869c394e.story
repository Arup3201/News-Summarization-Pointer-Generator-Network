Many of the planets discovered elsewhere in our galaxy are not like Earth, but rather more like Jupiter.

Such gas giants, as far as we know, are not hospitable to life, but now it has been suggested that the moons of these planets could be habitable.

If confirmed, it would suggest these locations could be the predominant sources for life in the universe, not worlds like our own Earth.

The idea was discussed by Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington in Seattle, on the Public Radio International's (PRI) show The Takeaway.

Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington was speaking to PRI. She said exomoons could be the 'predominant sites of life in the universe'. Shown is an illustration of Upsilon Andromedae d, the large world in the distance, orbiting the gas giant in the foreground, which could have habitable moons

She explained how Jupiter-sized planets in the habitable zones of stars - where conditions are ideal for water, and perhaps life - are more common than single rocky worlds like Earth.

Hot exomoons

Too close to a star and an exomoon may have an average temperature above the boiling point of water, making it highly unsuitable for any form of life.

Habitable exomoons

Exoplanets orbiting in a system’s habitable zone (where liquid water can persist on a planet’s surface) still need sufficient gravity to trap an atmosphere that regulates their temperature. If these conditions are met, however, the prospects for life are promising.

Snowball exomoons

Moons formed in the outer reaches of an alien solar system are likely to be dominated by ice. They will remain deep-frozen unless heated by tides from their parent planet - again these are unlikely to be habitats for life.

Transient exomoons

Moons of planets with elliptical orbits might be habitable for most of their planet’s year, but can experience hot or snowball periods as they venture too close to their star, or too far from its life-giving heat.

‘If even some of these Jupiter-sized planets have moons, they might be the predominant sites of life in the universe,’ she said.

In particular, she focused on the world of Upsilon Andromedae d, a gas giant exoplanet about 10 times the mass of Jupiter, located 44 light-years from Earth.

While the planet itself is not thought to be habitable, it is possible that a moon in its orbit - known as an exomoon - could be.

And if you were to step on the surface of the moon, you would see ‘beautiful tumultuous clouds on the Jovian planet’ and ‘incredibly complex cloud activity,’ according to Dr Ballard.

So far, no exomoons have been discovered, but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons, most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found.

It might be possible to find one in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope, or it may be necessary to wait for a more powerful planet-hunter to come online, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), due to launch in 2017. 

Finding exomoons is a bit of a problem though, as their mass and size is so much less than their host planet. 

One technique to find them that may prove successful is gravitational microlensing, which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one.

The chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star, and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit.

And we are able to rule certain planets out - ones that are too close to their host star, like Mercury and Venus in our own solar system, are unable to cling on to natural satellites.

But finding out if moons are common in our galaxy will be key for the search for life, and could signal a change in goals for planet-hunters in the near future.

‘The fact we reside on a single rocky hunk of rock, orbiting without a big brother planet, might be relatively unusual,’ added Dr Ballard.

Many planets discovered outside the solar system are Jupiter-sized worlds

It suggests habitable Earth-like planets may not be that common

Instead, moons orbiting larger planets could be the best bet for life
