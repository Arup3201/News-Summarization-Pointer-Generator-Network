A 17-year-old who was caught attempting to flee Australia to join jihadi militants in the Middle East had also been stopped by police just one day earlier during a first escape attempt.

Wearing a lime green cap and carrying a black backpack, the teen was removed from a plane at Sydney Airport on March 12 and interviewed by counter-terrorism officers, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton revealed on Wednesday.

However this was already the second effort the boy had made to escape the country after he had attempted to hop on a flight to Abu Dhabi - allegedly on his way to Syria - on March 11 before first being stopped, News Corp reports.

The third teenager to be caught by authorities trying to join Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East, was stopped from leaving the country by federal police two days in a row

'His name triggered the system and his passport was ­cancelled. He then turned up the next day and tried to board the same flight,' a senior source told News Corp.

Police then intercepted the teen during his second attempt, detaining and interviewing him before releasing him to his parents. 

It comes after two teenage brothers were also discovered trying to travel to the Middle East earlier this month. 

The first incident occured on March 11 and the second on March 12

The boy is the third teenager government officials have intercepted and amongst about 200 people stopped from heading overseas to become foreign fighters with terrorist groups.

He has since returned to his family again, with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO investigating the matter.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that while it was hard to believe people who had grown up in Australia's free and open society could be susceptible to brain washing by extremist groups such as Islamic State, it was clearly happening.

'It is very dangerous for you. It is very dangerous for others,' he told reporters in Canberra. 

It follows two brothers who were detained for doing the same earlier this month (pictured above)

The siblings aged 16 and 17 were questioned by counter-terrorism officers before they were sent home to their mother in Sydney's south-west 

There are fears that more teenagers could end up like Abdullah Elmir (pictured) who has been dubbed the 'Ginger Jihadist'

'We will do everything we can to stop you if you do try.'

The two brothers who were stopped earlier this month were aged 16 and 17.

The siblings were south-west Sydney and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained.

Authorities' suspicions were aroused after the two had booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage was searched. 

The latest teenager to be caught were trying to fly to the Middle East like notorious extremists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar 

Mohamed Elomar (above) has caused a stir on social media after posting photos of him with weapons and severed heads 

Meanwhile Khaled Sharrouf made international headlines after he posted photos of his children posing with guns

They were stopped on the night of March 6, Mr Dutton said at the time of the revelation.

Their parents were unaware of their plans to travel to the Middle East. The brothers were later issued court attendance notices. 

Under the new Foreign Fighters Act, customs officers are allowed to detain people where the officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is intending to commit a Commonwealth offence or is a threat to national security or the security of a foreign country. 

Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State.

Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner.
