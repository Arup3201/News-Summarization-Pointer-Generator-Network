The huntsmen look on as a baying pack on hounds rip a fox to shreds.

And then the horn is sounded: the fox is dead.

This harrowing video has been released after four members of the Middleton Hunt, based in North Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to hunting with hounds.

Scroll down for video...

Banned: This is the moment a pack of hounds attacked and killed a fox - footage of the banned hunt was used in evidence against four men who pleaded guilty to hunting a mammal with dogs

The men were fined between £85 and £200 each, but despite being caught, investigators doubt their case will have any impact on their future behaviour.

Paul Tillsley, head of investigations at the League Against Cruel Sports, and one of the team that filmed the incident, said: 'While we are pleased with this result, and the admission of guilt from the hunt staff concerned, we doubt it will change their behaviour going forward, or that the hunt themselves will admit illegal hunting and change their ways.'

The grisly video shows the terrified fox taking refuge under bales of hay for 25 minutes before hunt staff use terriers, sticks and hounds to force it into the open where the pack of dogs bring it down and tear it apart.

Hiding: The huntsmen initially sent terriers to flush out the fox who had been hiding from the pack of dogs in a pile of hay bales

Killed: The hunt master, right, blew his horn to announce the kill and congratulated the hounds

A triumphant huntsman then sounds his hunting horn - the traditional call for a kill when hunting was legal.

He then picks up the fox carcass and holds it over the hounds so that they can better attack and 'rag' it.

The shocking clip, filmed at Full Sutton, near York, last December, was handed over to police.

Huntsman Tim Holt, of Leavening, North Yorkshire, whipper-in Shaun Marles, of Titley, Hertfordshire, terrierman Lee Martin, of Birdsall, North Yorkshire, and amateur terrierman Brian Cuthbertson of Norton, North Yorkshire, all pleaded guilty to hunting a wild mammal with a dog, at York Magistrates Court.

Holt was fined £200, Marles was fined £100 and Martin was fined £100. All three had to pay a £20 surcharge and £85 in costs.

Cuthbertson was granted a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge and £85 costs.

Encouraging: He then picks up the carcass of the fox by the tail and allows the hounds to tug at it or 'rag' it

After the kill, the 'terrierman' picked up the carcass and took it away with the terrier continuing to bite at it

After the case, Mr Tillsley said: 'We know that many hunts are regularly out there breaking the law, and that's precisely why we have a team of professional Investigators in the field - to capture illegal activity and work with the relevant authorities to bring about prosecutions.

'This case is one of several from our work during the last hunting season (2012/13), but a new season is just beginning. We can only hope that successful cases like this will make hunts think twice about continuing to blatantly flout the law, and start adapting their practices to hunt false trails, leaving animals well alone.

'This was the will of the British public when the Hunting Act 2004 was passed, but sadly it didn't save this fox. The successful outcome of this case today is a clear example of how the Hunting Act 2004 can, and does, work when enforced.'

The hunt retreats taking the evidence of the mauled fox away with them

Tim Bonnar, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: 'The Middleton Hunt has accepted that the fox should have been shot in accordance with the exemption rather than killed by hounds.

'Whilst the Hunting Act remains a ridiculous and illogical law, pleading guilty to minimise the time and money wasted on this case, was the sensible thing to do.'

The Hunting Act 2004 bans the hunting of wild mammals, notably foxes, deer and hares, with dogs in England and Wales.

In addition, a person commits an offence if he knowingly permits land which belongs to him to be entered or used in the course of hunting wild mammals.

A person also commits an offence if he knowingly permits a dog which belongs to him to be used for hunting.

Anyone found guilty under the Hunting Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.

The pursuit of foxes with hounds was banned in Scotland two years in the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002.

However, hunting foxes with hounds remains legal in Northern Ireland.
