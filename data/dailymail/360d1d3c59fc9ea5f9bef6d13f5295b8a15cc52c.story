Millions of Britons could be at risk of life-threatening diseases from an unlikely source - their filthy carpets.

Unclean rugs can contain a shocking level of disease-inducing bacteria, according to research released today.

After swabbing the shoes of people of various ages across the UK, scientists found high levels of bacteria from the pneumonia and E.Coli families.

They also discovered vomit-inducing toxins and traces of  gut and faecal bacteria from both animals and humans.

The vast majority of those surveyed did not know some carpets are often embedded with horse and fox manure, urine, vomit, tar, human and pet hair, dust mites, pollen and traces of skin, according to the study by carpet cleaning firm Rug Doctor.

It found that around 40 per cent of Britons wear footwear inside and less than one in five clean the bottom of their shoes.

More than a quarter (28 per cent) of the UK’s population has had a pet vomit on the floor and 24 per cent have endured a pet leaving their mess.

Furthermore, nearly a third (30 per cent) have had a baby or someone else be sick on their carpet and a quarter (22 per cent) admit to having had sex on the floor. A total of 91 per cent  let their children play on the carpet.

Dr Pixie McKenna, from TV's Embarrassing Bodies, called the statisics 'shocking'.

'Dangerous bugs like pneumonia and E. Coli
 are being brought into our homes on the soles of our shoes, and are 
then trampled into the carpets by us not removing our shoes at the 
door,' she said.

Dr Pixie McKenna, who appears on C4's Embarrassing Bodies, says poor hygiene in the home is a health risk

'In fact, 41 per cent of people say they still don't intend to remove their footwear at the door.

'This is no laughing matter - poor hygiene at home risks your health.'

The research also asked Britons about a range of hygiene habits and saw a third admit they don't always wash their hands after going to the toilet, almost half leave the same sheets on their bed for weeks, while half use the same dish cloths and sponges over and over again. 

One in ten don't wash their towels weekly, the same number don't clean their teeth twice a day, and only half (53 per cent) shower or bathe once a day.

Almost a third of pet owners admit they 
let the animals sleep in the bed with them, with more than 40 per cent 
saying they let them up on the sofa.
