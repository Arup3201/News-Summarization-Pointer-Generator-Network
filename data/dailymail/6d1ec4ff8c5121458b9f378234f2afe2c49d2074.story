A Hong Kong man has been found guilty of murdering his parents before chopping their bodies and cooking them in a microwave. 

Nine members of the jury found Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, 31, guilty by a 8-1 majority although his co-accused Tse Chun-kei, 38, was acquitted. 

Both men had previously pleaded guilty to charges of preventing the lawful burial of Chau's father Chau Wing-ki, 65, and his mother, Siu Yuet-yee, 63.

Tse was handed a one-year jail term for the unlawful burial charges but was released from custody due to the length of time he has already spent on remand. 

However, Henry Chau will be sentenced on Monday. 

The South China Morning Post said Judge Michael Stuart-Moore described Henry Chau as an extremely dangerous man who was a complete failure in life.

Judge Stuart-Moore added that the killer blamed everyone except himself for his current problems. 

Both men denied murdering the couple on March 1, 2013. 

The court heard that Henry Chau's parents went with him on the morning of their murder to see his new home in Tai Kok Tsui. 

Several days after they disappeared their eldest son Chau Hoi-ying wanted to raise the alarm, but Henry Chau said the couple had travelled to mainland China on a visit. 

Eventually the eldest son went to the police with the killer to report their parents missing. 

The court heard that Henry Chau sent a Watsapp message to friends admitting killing his parents.

Police found the heads of Chau's parents inside these refrigerators removed from Tse's apartment  

One of the friends reported the message to police who arrested Henry Chau and his friend Tse Chun-kei. Searching Tse's flat, forensics officers recovered the couple's heads stored in two large refrigerators. Several plastic lunch boxes containing chopped flesh and organs were also found.

A further three plastic boxes containing salted body parts were found in a different room. 

The missing body parts are believed to have been cooked and eaten. 

A pathologist reassembled the skeletons, which had same parts missing. He testified that the couple were stabbed in either their chest or neck before being dismembered. 

Henry Chau told investigators that he wanted to kill himself six months before the attack, but was convinced to take revenge on his parents instead by Tse. 

Police believe that the couple were murdered and dismembered in Tse's flat, although he denied taking any part in the killing.

Prosecutors claimed that Henry Chau and Tse discussed a range of methods of disposing of the bodies - including mixing the remains with cement and throwing them away as bricks.  

Other plans included cooking the remains and throwing them into the sea. 

Tse said the only reason he helped Henry Chau is because he was afraid that his friend would kill his mother.

Henry Chau first claimed that he did not kill his parents but only helped his friend dismember the remains. 

He later tried to plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.
