Support: Patrick Rock, 63, pictured arrving at Westminster magistrates' court yesterday, was assigned a welfare officer after his arrest

A former adviser to David Cameron accused of possessing indecent images of children is still being supported by Downing Street, a court heard yesterday.

Patrick Rock, 63, was assigned a welfare officer by No 10 when his arrest led to his resignation from a role at the heart of Government four months ago.

He appeared at Westminster magistrates’ court in London even though no evidence against him was found on British soil.

He was held at his sister’s home in the US state of North Carolina. 

The court was told he had 59 indecent images of children on an iPad. District Judge John Zani ordered Rock, from Fulham, West London, to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court later this month.

He was released on bail with a number of conditions, including that he maintain contact with the Downing Street-appointed welfare officer. 

He was also told to surrender his passport.

Rock was arrested in February by the National Crime Agency, but the investigation was made public only when it was revealed by this newspaper. 

The secrecy remains unexplained.

Rock, ex-deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidants. 

He worked for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s and was involved in drawing up government policy on filters designed to block images of child abuse.

The crimes are alleged to have taken place between July 31 and August 31 last year.

Mr Rock, deputy director of the Downing Street policy unit and a protege of Margaret Thatcher, was one of Mr Cameron’s closest confidantes.

The two men were close for two decades and worked for Michael Howard when he was Home Secretary in the 1990s.

The public servant was involved in drawing up Government policy on filters designed to block vile images of child abuse.

And his seniority was demonstrated by the fact that he was one of only three advisers given his own private office in No 10.

According to official guidelines, people convicted of possessing category C indecent images are likely to receive a community penalty.  

Rock was arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in February after he was accused of being in possession of indecent images on his iPad
