A Muslim cleric is demanding £50,000 compensation from the Home Office after he was placed under house arrest over his suspected links to Al-Qaeda.

The alleged hate preacher was put under a control order for three years after MI5 reportedly suspected him of being one of the greatest terror threats to national security.

His movements were restricted, he was banned from using the internet or a mobile phone and prevented from studying science at college.

The man, who can only be referred to as 
AE because an anonymity order prevents him being named, was also forbidden from contacting a ring of alleged 
extremists linked to a British mosque.

But the control order, made in 2006, was quashed by the High Court when the security services refused to reveal more of the evidence against him after a request from the Iraqi cleric's lawyers, it was reported by The Daily Mirror.

The man, who lives in Britain with his 
wife and children, is one of at 
least four former terror suspects who courts have given the go-ahead to 
sue for 'illegal detention'.

In a court document detailing its evidence, MI5 alleged AE had 'extremist and criminal' contacts in the UK.

During a search of his home in August 2005, MI5 said his computer revealed he had 'visited websites selling toy remote-controlled helicopters and cars'.

It alleged he had also looked into buying lowlight pinhole cameras and had been involved in identity fraud on behalf of his extremist contacts.

But the security agency said giving more evidence was not in the national interest.

AE's Bradford-based lawyer Mohammed Ayub said he was now negotiating with the Home Office for a payout.

He said: 'He contends he is innocent. The Home Office never disclosed any evidence, therefore my client could never receive a fair trial.

'He couldn't respond to the allegations other than to deny them. My client has lost a significant portion of his life while subject to the control order.'

The Home Office told MailOnline: 'We cannot comment on individual cases.'
