Harlequins stuck to their side of the deal but were left to rue results elsewhere as they crashed out of Europe.

Under heavy snowfall in southern France, Conor O’Shea and his coaching staff watched on a laptop as Leinster’s failure to beat Wasps in Coventry brought a painful end to their Champions Cup hopes.

The seven tries to three scoreline will send the club’s England contingent — Joe Marler, Chris Robshaw, Nick Easter, Danny Care and Mike Brown — to Pennyhill Park in bittersweet spirits, as the west London side finished third in Pool 2.

‘We did what we needed to do and unfortunately we couldn’t control anything else,’ said O’Shea. 

‘Towards the end we were watching on the laptop and seeing Leinster miss drop goals and penalties. Ian Madigan is an 80-90 per cent kicker and I think he kicked three from seven. We could only control what we could control.

‘You can’t rely on others and that’s the position we left ourselves in. I thought we played pretty well in tough conditions.’

Just 6,802 turned out in the freezing conditions but Castres delivered a typically partisan reaction when Marler went over for the opening try in the 12th minute.

Quins were sniffing for the four-try bonus point and, after turning down a kick at goal, Nick Evans kicked for the corner. A serious looking knee injury meant Will Collier was withdrawn from action, however the travelling pack pulled together and Marler was on hand to finish a driving maul from the line-out.

Charlie Walker and Brown were reading from different hymn sheets when a misplaced pass almost gifted Castres a try, shortly before scrum-half Antoine Dupont dived over to level.

Walker used pace and footwork to skip past Remi Tales for the third try, but the Languedoc side once again evened things up, this time through centre Romain Cabannes.

His midfield partner, Thomas Combezou, was sin-binned just before half-time and that proved to be the turning point, as Quins used their advantage to pull away with scores from Care and Jack Clifford.

Castres were half-cooked, with star man Rory Kockott rested. When Remy Grosso was shown the second yellow card of the game, Quins turned the screw through Mark Lambert and Marland Yarde.

But in the end it was all for nothing. Johnnie Beattie and George Lowe exchanged late tries, but their fate had already been sealed back in the Midlands.
