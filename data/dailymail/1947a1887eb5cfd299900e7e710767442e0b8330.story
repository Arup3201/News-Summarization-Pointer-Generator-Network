Hearts officially exited administration on Wednesday and brought to an end one of the most painful and worrying periods in the club’s history. 

Now the priority is to fight their way back to Scottish football’s top flight under the stewardship of Ann Budge. 

With Hibs and Rangers vying for the Championship title next season that will be no easy task.

But when the very survival of the club was in doubt for much of the last 12 months, Wednesday’s announcement was another reason for optimism for Hearts fans.

In a statement, new owner Ann Budge said: ‘By now you will have all heard and, yes, it's true, we have formally exited administration!

‘Everyone associated with the club is ecstatic and now we can really begin to  move ahead in implementing our plans for the future.

‘So what now? Well, the first thing is to get season tickets on sale as quickly as possible and the club will be issuing information regarding this tomorrow. 

‘Following this, we will shortly be issuing information on new signings and more pre-season friendlies which, I know, is what all the fans are desperate to here.

‘However, for today, let's just celebrate the news!’

Ian Murray MP, chairman of Foundation of Hearts, added: ‘We are obviously delighted. We were always looking forward to this day and we were hoping it would have come a lot sooner, but we were never confident until (administrators) BDO left the Court of Session with the paperwork all signed,  sealed and delivered to say the club is officially out of administration and can progress towards fan ownership.

‘I am naturally a fairly optimistic person at the best of times but even the most optimistic person would have, at various points along the way, feared this  day was not going to come and that we should prepare for the worst-case scenario. 

‘But to be fair to BDO they have used all their skill and professionalism to  push things through and deal with all the frustrations to reach this historic  day for Hearts. 

‘It’s important to stress that this is not the end of the process, it’s the start of the process of rebuilding the club, a club which has been hollowed out by the previous owners, and it’s now about getting the finances healthy again  and getting the team back into the Premiership.

‘But Hearts fans are the same as supporters of other clubs, we want to be  talking about football and this means we can get on with that.’ 

Difficult: Coach Robbie Neilson will have a tough job turning the club's fortunes around in the Scottish First Division

FoH have already ploughed £1million into the club to help clear over £500,000 of football debt taken on by Budge’s new regime and the organisation’s more than 8,000 monthly contributors will finance £1.4m over the next two seasons.

Surplus cash raised by FoH will be banked to allow the fans to pay off Budge’s  £2.5m ‘loan’ within the next five years and give the supporters full control of a club brought back from brink. 

Joint administrator Bryan Jackson, who has now successfully overseen the administration exits of Hearts, Dunfermline, Dundee and Motherwell, was a satisfied man last night after finally being able to pass the club back to new owners with the prospect of a bright future ahead. 

He said: ‘This has been a challenging and complex process which has, fortunately, had a successful conclusion.

‘In entering into an administration you can never be sure of the outcome and it is often a case of dealing with the day-to-day issues whilst also pushing for the final goal of exiting administration. 

‘There have been many people involved with this process over the last year and many have lived and breathed every minute of this administration in their efforts to produce this result. 

‘I would again like to thank Ann Budge and her team at the club, the Foundation, the fans, Peter Duff and all at Morisons LLP for their outstanding legal advice and patience, as well as the staff at BDO who have all put up with  a lot to ensure the great name of Hearts survives to fight another day.’
