Bargain hunters swamped supermarkets across the country after hearing that twin packs of cheese were on sale for just £1.

Shoppers flocked to Tesco stores after an internet forum reported a price 'glitch' which saw the packs, usually priced at £6.55, sell for £1.

Financial expert Martin Lewis's Money 
Saving Expert website revealed two 350g Cathedral City Mature 
Cheddars were selling at an 85 per cent discount.

Say cheese! Tesco was swamped by customers after a price glitch which saw twin packs of cheese sold for £1

Tesco denied the bargain was a 'glitch' and said it was a deal introduced at the beginning of the week

Bargain experts working for the site believed it was an error over what was supposed to be a £1 off deal.

A message read: ‘We believe this was meant to be a one pound off the 6.55 packs promotion, but entered the wrong way around.

‘So if you can find the packs, it's scanning through tills at a ridiculously cheap price.’

After posting the bargain on Twitter through Martin Lewis's page, customers swarmed stores, taking advantage of the error 
and leaving with bags full of cheese.

They then posted photos online of their 
fridges bursting with the bargain packs.

Members of another money-saving website HotUKDeals reported buying more than 20 packs.

One, called Sliwka, said: ‘I don't have enough space in my fridge!!! What now?’

A member, called brycoboy, made up the HotUKDeals logo using a staggering 28 packs of the cut-price cheddar.

What a bargain! Financial expert Martin Lewis' Money Saving Expert website had revealed two 350g Cathedral City Mature Cheddars were selling at an 85 per cent discount

And another kel*ace said: ‘Just got two packs and scanned at £1 each, thank you :)’

Tesco today denied the bargain was a 'glitch', saying it had been a deal introduced at the beginning of the week.

Although stores were today advertising the packs at their usual price, at a branch in Bursledon, near Southampton, they were still scanning for £1.

A spokesperson said: ‘Our popular offer continues while stocks last.’
