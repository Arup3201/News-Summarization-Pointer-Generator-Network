Country lovers are queuing up to stay in one of Britain's most exclusive holiday homes - with its own herd of deer.

Visitors are handed the keys to a 1,000-acre estate, which includes a Victorian Abbey, a 17th-century orangery and the chance to feed their own bambis every day.

But holidaymakers will need deep pockets as the going rate is up to £1,000-a-week at Margam Park on the Welsh coast.

The cottage itself sits in the deer enclosure of Margam Park, which overlooks Swansea Bay

The cottage is on the same property as a Castle, Victorian Abbey and 17th-century orangery with gardens

Guests can book to stay in the newly refurbished Ivy Cottage which stands in the deer enclosure at Margam Park overlooking Swansea Bay in South Wales.

The orangery is popular wedding venue and Oscar-winning Welsh movie star Sir Anthony Hopkins - who was born in South Wales - had his 70th birthday party there in 2008.

But now people can stay for a stag night with a difference watching the deer go about their daily activities.

Margam Park spokeswoman Alison Lloyd said: 'As holiday cottages go. this one is unique. 

There are plenty of deer to spot as they roam among the 1,000-acre park

'Where else can you have your own key to a park like this, so that after hours you have it to yourself?'

The Jacobean three-bedroomed cottage was given a major makeover as part of a £2m refurbishment - including money from the national lottery.

Mrs Lloyd added: 'We have refurbished it to five-star standards and it looks amazing.

'It is a lovely private spot, but still so close to the M4 motorway if you need it.

'There's been no shortage of booking since we opened - it is the perfect spot for country lovers to view a heard of beautiful deer in an amazing setting.' 

With help from the National Lottery, the house now boasts a chic, walled garden

Indoor furnishings are complete with comfy leather seating and a flat screen TV

Guests just need to unlock the cottage's private gate for free access to the Margam County Park 

The cottage's Jacobean façade is a feature of historic significance because of its quality and rarity.

'It is the work of the great Victorian architect Inigo Jones according to the Cambrian Archaeological Association.

The frontage was originally from the banqueting house on the site of the present Margam Castle and it is depicted in two 17th-century paintings.

But before the restoration the cottage was being used as the country park's gardeners as a mess room.

Mrs Lloyd said: 'It had fallen into serious disrepair but with financial assistance from the European Regional Development Fund, the Heritage Lottery Fund and Neath Port Talbot Council we have been able to restore this important grade one listed structure.

'We are very pleased with the results.'

The cottage also comes with everything necessary to host a lovely dinner party with a view
