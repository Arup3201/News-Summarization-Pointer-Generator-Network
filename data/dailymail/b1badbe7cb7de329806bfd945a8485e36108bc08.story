The BBC Director General has lavished praise on staff for what he called their 'outstanding' coverage of the Jubilee weekend – despite a storm of protest about the standard of the programmes.

The broadcaster's Jubilee coverage had by last night prompted 2,425 complaints from viewers.

Nearly 2,000 were about the coverage of Sunday's river pageant, which even some BBC figures described as 'lamentable' and 'mind-numbingly tedious'.

Plaudits: BBC Director General Mark Thompson has heaped praise on his staff for their coverage of the Jubilee

Yet in an internal email to staff yesterday, Mark Thompson wrote: 'Our output has been impressive not only in its scale, but in its ambition, quality and outstanding journalism.

'By capturing the spectacle of the Thames Pageant and yesterday's ceremonies alongside smaller local celebrations we reflected reaction from up and down the country.'

He added – without irony – that the BBC had 'made our own contribution to a special moment in our nation's history'.

The extraordinary comments stunned many BBC journalists who are said to feel 'deeply embarrassed' by the coverage. There was further incredulity when the corporation confirmed that many of the presenters who fronted the Jubilee coverage will be given key roles in the Olympics.

Matt Baker – who viewers described as 'woeful' and 'out of his depth' during the pageant – will be fronting the 'live action'  from inside the Olympic Park.

BBC veteran Peter Sissons said the number of complaints was 'very serious' and bosses should have a 'serious rethink' about the presenting line-up ahead of the Olympics.

The former newsreader said: 'The BBC should look long and hard at a lot of the presenters from that Sunday. Some of them were absolutely appalling. You're only as good as your last show – and on that basis a lot of them should be very worried indeed.'

Viewers were aghast at the idea that the Jubilee presenters would be featured during the Olympics. One wrote: 'Chris Hollins – God I hope the BBC has more up its sleeve than this for the Olympics.' Another added: 'If we all bribe the BBC with cold, hard cash, will they promise not to employ Fearne Cotton or Matt Baker during the Olympics?'

War veterans have joined the criticism of the BBC river pageant coverage, claiming they were made to stand in the rain for more than an hour while waiting to be interviewed.

Fearne Cotton's interview with men on board HMS Belfast has already been condemned by viewers after she called one 'Jim' when his name was John.

Yesterday former petty officer Bryan Stockley, 75, who served on Belfast in the Far East, said the shipmates' experience was 'absolutely traumatic'.

The 26 former seamen, all aged between 70 and 90, were summoned to the quarterdeck, where they were left to shiver in the cold while only two were interviewed.

Mr Stockley, from Monmouth, south Wales, said their day was 'completely ruined'. He added: 'It was appallingly inconsiderate to ask people of our age to stand for so long and get so cold.'

A spokesman for the BBC said it had apologised for the delay to the interviews. 'We endeavoured to speak to as many of the people involved in the pageant as possible.'

As well as the river pageant, the BBC has received hundreds of complaints about its coverage of the palace pop concert on Monday. Around 500 were unhappy that the programme credits were played over the spectacular four-minute firework display which closed the event. Comedian Lenny Henry was also criticised for cutting short Rolf Harris's sing-along of Two Little Boys.

Some of the strongest critics of the BBC's Jubilee output have been its own stars. Stephen Fry said the BBC's coverage of the pageant was 'mind-numbingly tedious'. Kevin Marsh, a former editor of the Today programme and The World At One, called the coverage 'lamentable' and 'scarcely credible'.

The corporation's obituaries editor Nick Serpell said that some of the coverage had him 'reaching for the sick-bag'.

The executive responsible for the coverage has gone on holiday. BBC Vision director George Entwistle was unable to appear on Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday to defend the corporation, although it is understood he did not leave until the coverage had been completed on Tuesday.

As a result, the job fell to former BBC executive Mark Damazer – who was less than robust in his defence of the corporation.

Damazer admitted that the BBC had 'probably tried too hard' to be inclusive. What had gone wrong was 'a conscious attempt, I think, to make the whole event as it were informal and to use the modern idiom, inclusive and warm'.

'The BBC just probably tried too hard. It's just that the BBC on these occasions – and there's a long history of it – is worried about being seen as “Auntie” and being too formal and too stiff.'

He added: 'I don't think this is going to be the BBC's Bafta Award winning entry next year.'

A spokesman for the corporation said: 'The concert was watched by a peak audience of 17million, making it the highest rating show of the year, whilst an average audience of over 10million saw our coverage of the pageant, a broadcasting event of unprecedented scale and complexity.'

BBC creative director Alan Yentob also dismissed the complaints, saying no coverage ever received a 'universal three cheers'. He told Radio 4's Media Show that the BBC had tried to make the 'tone' of the river parade about the 'people too' and 'enjoying that day'.

Mr Yentob added the BBC was 'happy to learn' from the mistakes which had been made, admitting that there were 'some aspects of it perhaps which could have been better'.

He said: 'It's fair to criticise it and we will certainly look at it. But I don't believe that you can say in every aspect this thing failed.'
