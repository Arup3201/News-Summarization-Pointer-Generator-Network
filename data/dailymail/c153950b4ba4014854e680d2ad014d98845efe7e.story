Great Britain's men and women had to settle for silver in today's 470 class events.

Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell, were pleased with their medal, but Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark said they were 'gutted' with their position.

The men's pair came into the re-arranged medal race with second-place assured and still eyeing top spot, which they hoped to wrestle off Mathew Belcher and Malcolm Page.

Patience and Bithell needed at least one boat in between them and the Australians to take gold, but, after an impressive start, lost ground on their rivals, who finished ahead of the home favourites to claim the victory.

The medal race was originally due to take place yesterday, but light winds on the course saw it delayed until midday Friday.

There was only six knots of wind this afternoon but racing got under way as planned, with Patience and Bithell making the better start.

After chasing Belcher and Page during the pre-start, the British pair enjoyed a successful first leg and rounded the windward mark in the lead with Croatia second and their rivals in third.

However, the Australians proved why 
they are world champions by overtaking Patience and Bithell downwind to 
round the bottom mark in the lead.

Britain
were behind Croatia's Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic in third, but 
responded well with aggressive sailing to bring the fleet back in.

They
rounded the third mark in fourth, though, and saw their hopesof gold 
fade when they had to do a penalty turn for pumping the sails in the 
light winds.

Patience and Bithell rounded the 
final mark in fourth and could only watch on as Croatia won the medal 
race and Belcher and Page crossed the line second to secure gold - 
Australia's third of the sailing regatta.

'We tried it, we got the better of them at the start and just managed to just sneak ahead,' Bithell told BBC Sport.

'Unfortunately we sneaked ahead of the rest of the fleet as well. We had hoped they would be there as well.

'They
sailed a fantastic race, we tried to attack them when we could and hats
off to them. They held their nerve and are worthy champions. We're 
happy with second.'

Patience
echoed those sentiments, adding: 'It's been three years, four years of 
hard work together and we're here standing on an Olympic podium.

'It's
not gold but there's plenty of time. We're young boys and we'll be 
coming back and we'll mean business next time around yet again.

'For now, enjoy the moment. Stuart's 
an absolute legend and we're happy, happy boys. What a week. Regatta of 
our lives. What a place. We're in paradise, aren't we? It's cool - so 
cool.'

Mills and Clark lost 
their battle for gold as Great Britain were thwarted by Antipodean 
opposition for the second time of the day.

Having
seen Australia deny Luke Patience and Stuart Bithell top spot in the 
men's 470 class, the world champions suffered the same fate on the south
coast.

Mills and Clark 
entered the medal race top of the standings alongside Jo Aleh and Olivia
Powrie, although it was the New Zealand pair that won the race and took
the gold medal as Britain collected their fourth sailing silver of 
London 2012.

They were 
guaranteed of winning a medal due to their points tally after the 
opening 10-race series. as long as they were not disqualified or black 
flagged, and began impressively.

The Kiwis tacked off at the start due to pressure from the Brits, which saw the rivals end on opposite sides in the first leg.

Unfortunately for Mills and Clark, it was the right side that paid and they were on the left so could only watch on as Aleh and Powrie powered ahead.

The New Zealand pair rounded the first mark in the lead, with one minute 13 seconds separating them and the 10th-place Brits.

As the wind all but disappeared, Aleh and Powrie moved into an almost unassailable lead - two minutes 22 seconds ahead around the second mark.

Mills and Clark saw their chances cut even further as the race officials chose to shorten the course due to the lack of wind.

It meant less distance for the British pair to catch the Kiwis, who went on to win the medal race and secure gold.

Britain won silver despite coming home in ninth, while the Netherlands' Lisa Westerhof and Lobke Berkhout took bronze ahead of France's Camille Lecointre and Mathilde Geron.

'I think we just feel a bit gutted at the moment that we didn't even put a good show on, really,' Clark told BBC Sport.

'We had the Kiwis at the start line and then we let them go to the right and didn't follow them.

'We were wedged in with a few boats and halfway up the beat we knew that the gold medal had gone from us.'

Mills echoed her sentiments, adding: 'It was tricky. We felt the left had better breeze, which is why we wanted to get left, but the wind died and that was kind of game over.

'I am pretty gutted, to be honest, but we've had a wicked 18 months together. Sas is amazing and we've had a great time.'
