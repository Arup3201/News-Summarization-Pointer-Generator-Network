The first time I saw the young Jimmy Anderson bowl, in a televised match for Lancashire, I turned to the Sky producer and asked if the speed gun was working properly. He assured me it was. It said he was bowling at 90mph.

Back then he used to just bowl as fast as he could. Since then, Jimmy has become an artist — and has answered every question posed of him.

He put them to bed; Anderson can only bowl in English conditions, it was said. It has to swing for him to prosper, it was said. Now he is rapidly approaching Sir Ian Botham’s English Test wicket record and has the capacity to go well past 400 wickets.

Jimmy is a typical Burnley lad. Burnley folk tend not to speak until they’re spoken to and they weigh up strangers before deciding whether they are worth talking to. They have a dry sense of humour.

Duncan Fletcher once said to me: ‘What can you tell me about this lad Anderson? He never says anything.’ I said: ‘Fletch, you played in the Lancashire Leagues just up the road. You know what they’re like!’ All of which makes Jimmy’s attitude on the pitch such a contrast. To me, he is just like Glenn McGrath. But Jimmy does not get sidetracked if he loses his rag with someone. It fires him up.

Anderson has come a very long way from his Burnley days. And maybe sometimes, like at Trent Bridge this season, he really does think of himself as the Burnley Lara!

Consider the best fast bowlers England have had and you think of Fred Trueman, Botham and Bob Willis. Well, Anderson is right up there with them and I’m thrilled for him.

I imagine Jimmy is a captain’s dream because he just gets on with his job. All power to him.

He's up there with the best ever ! Anderson is similar to Australia legend Glenn McGrath
