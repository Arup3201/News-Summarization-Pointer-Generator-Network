A schoolboy has forced Tesco to admit it made a mistake on the label of its orange juice after he noticed an embarrassing grammatical blunder.  

Albert Gifford, 15, was enjoying his breakfast at home in Shepton Mallet, Somerset when he saw that his carton of juice boasted it was made with the 'most tastiest' oranges.  

He wrote to the supermarket giant to complain, suggesting they change the wording to 'tastiest' or 'most tasty' - and they have now agreed to correct the packaging.  

Fury: Albert Gifford was shocked to find an embarrassing grammatical blunder on a carton of Tesco juice

Albert, who is studying for his GCSEs at Whitstone School, saw the mistake on the £1 carton of orange juice one morning last month.

The label read: 'Only the best quality fruit makes the grade for our juices. We squeeze or press it only when it's perfectly ripe and at its most tastiest.'  

In his anger at the use of redundant language, Albert marched to his local branch of Tesco to confront the management - but decided it might be more prudent to write to the company instead.  

He also sent a letter to his local newspaper, saying: 'I am writing concerning an issue I have had with the very popular supermarket chain, Tesco.  

Wrong: The supermarket giant described the fruit contained in its juice as the 'most tastiest'

'There is a grammatical error on one of their products, and this has affected me greatly.  

'I
 woke up on Thursday morning a few weeks ago, thinking it would be like 
any other. I sat down at the table for breakfast like normal, and picked
 up the Tesco orange juice.  

'It
 was then that I noticed it said "most tastiest" when describing the 
fruit on the side of the carton. Of course, this could be either "most 
tasty" or simply "tastiest" but to say "most tastiest" is just wrong.  

'I
 was so astonished by this error - especially as Tesco is such a large 
company - that I almost started pouring the orange juice on to my 
Weetabix.

'My mum stopped me just in time, and shared my shock when I showed her the side of the carton.' 

Campaign: The 15-year-old schoolboy wrote to Tesco in a bid to make them acknowledge their error

After writing to Tesco, he said, 'For the next few weeks I rushed home after school, beside myself with the anticipation of a receiving a reply.  

'But every day I came home to a doormat with only the occasional leaflet urging me to buy this furniture or those clothes, but nothing from Tesco.  

'I was devastated the mighty supermarket chain hadn't even acknowledged my existence.'  

Finally the firm replied, apologising for the mistake and promising not to repeat it in future.  

'I'm sorry that there's a grammatical error on our Tesco Pure Smooth Orange Juice packaging,' a spokesman told Albert, who hopes to study medicine at university.  

'Our design team checks all packaging very carefully before it's used on any of our products, and we carry out regular reviews, but apparently we overlooked this mistake. I've told our team about this and they will correct the error when the packaging is reprinted.'  

The schoolboy said: 'I was happy to have a letter back, but a little bit disappointed because it didn't say more and I didn't get any vouchers - but I'm pleased with the result.' 

He joked: 'I don't think supermarket packaging should be wholly responsible for teaching young people English grammar - but I can't help thinking that "every little helps".'
