One man decided to take the 'cute couple selfie' to a new level by using it as an opportune moment to propose to his flabbergasted girlfriend.

Kenny Mercier, 33, a film producer from Troy, Michigan, struck a pose alongside his sweetheart, Lisa Holloway, while he whipped out his phone.

But instead of hitting 'photo', he hit the 'record' button. After pretending to encounter a technical hitch he got down on one knee to ask: 'Will you marry me?'

Footage shows a shell-shocked Lisa struggling for words.

'Oh my God, yeah! Are you serious? Is this for real?' the full-time nurse exclaims, while pulling a mix of surprised facial expressions.

'Oh my God,' she continually repeats while fanning her face.

Kenny reassures Lisa that the whole thing is real and pulls out an engagement ring to prove it.

As he puts the band on her finger he discovers it's the wrong size.

Caught on camera: One man decided to take the 'cute couple selfie' to a new level by using it as an opportune moment to propose to his flabbergasted girlfriend.

Novel idea: Kenny Mercier, 33, a film producer from Troy, Michigan, struck a pose alongside his sweetheart, Lisa Holloway, while he whipped out his phone.

Look of surprise: But instead of hitting 'photo' he hit the 'record' button and got down on one knee to ask: 'Will you marry me?'

'It's way too big,' he says in a disappointed tone, but an excited Lisa doesn't care.

She gives Kenny a big hug and kiss as tears well up in her eyes.

The couple got engaged  in Detroit last year and there is no word on when their wedding will take place.

Their proposal video, which went online this month, has been watched more than half-a-million times.

Many viewers have deemed 35-year-old Lisa's reaction 'cute' and 'hilarious'. However, one less enthused viewer wrote: 'Do women really get this blown away when they get proposed to? 

'Is she shocked at the size of the ring or the moment of proposal? Or both? I never really understood this sort of thing. Then again, I'm not a woman.'

Speechless: Footage shows Lisa with her eyes and mouth wide open, struggling for words 

Bride-to-be: 'Oh my God, yeah. Are you serious like now? Is this for real?' the full-time nurse exclaims, while pulling a mix of surprised facial expressions
