Strumming on his guitar and singing to an intimate audience of fellow Christians, this is Sir Cliff Richard backstage at a Billy Graham rally in June 1985, after appearing as a special guest.

Almost three decades later, the singer has been accused of sexually assaulting a boy at the event at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane football stadium – an allegation he vehemently denies.

Today, 95-year-old Graham, who once toured the globe spreading the message of God to millions, is confined to his North Carolina home, suffering from Parkinson’s disease.

The American evangelist is in no physical or mental state to support his old friend but there is little doubt he would do so if he could. 

The pair, united by a shared faith, have been friends for 48 years.

Sir Cliff has repeatedly described Graham as his ‘hero’. 

The singer was one of the country’s biggest stars when he became a Christian in the mid-1960s. 

It was at a Billy Graham ‘crusade’ event, in front of 27,000 people at Earls Court in London, that the star announced his newfound faith.

Word of his conversion had spread to Graham’s organisers, who invited him to be a special guest on June 16, 1966. 

Dressed in a jacket and tie and wearing glasses, Sir Cliff spoke from the lectern, crediting his parents for bringing him up on the Bible.

‘I can only say to people who are not Christians that until you have taken the step of asking Christ into your life, your life is not worthwhile.

When Graham returned to the UK in 1984 to preach, Sir Cliff was by his side. He told an audience at Villa Park, Birmingham: ‘For me being a Christian has become the most important part of my life’ 

' It works. It works for me,’ he said, before singing It Is No Secret, a gospel song recorded by Elvis.

After the service – during which Graham performed his brand of Christian rhetoric to the assembled crowds – the singer addressed the 5,000 people listening via a PA system outside the venue. 

That night was a turning point in Cliff Richard’s life. The influence of Graham stayed with him over the decades and he made many more guest appearances for the evangelist.

Realising that being a Christian was not in keeping with the usual image of a pop star, Sir Cliff contemplated becoming a teacher instead. 

He sat in on RE lessons at a Sussex grammar school and spent two months at an Anglican theological college. But friends persuaded him against abandoning music.

His association with Graham became stronger and he appeared in 1967 film Two A Penny – released by Billy Graham World Wide Pictures. That summer, Cliff discussed his faith on TV with Graham and was inspired by the preacher to use his stardom to spread the word of God.

In a tribute for a book about Graham, Sir Cliff wrote: ‘From the first time I heard him preach … I admired his courage, his faith and his style. As I got to know him … admiration developed into a huge respect as I recognised his dedication and unswerving integrity.’

When Graham returned to the UK in 1984 to preach, Sir Cliff was by his side. He told an audience at Villa Park, Birmingham: ‘For me being a Christian has become the most important part of my life.’ 

The next year he sang at an event in front of 47,000 at Sheffield’s Bramall Lane – details of which are the subject of the police inquiry.

As his career earned him a knighthood, Sir Cliff’s devotion to Graham remained as strong as ever. In 1996, Graham preached to a TV audience of 2.5billion. 

The programme, billed as the world’s biggest evangelist event, was hosted by Sir Cliff.
