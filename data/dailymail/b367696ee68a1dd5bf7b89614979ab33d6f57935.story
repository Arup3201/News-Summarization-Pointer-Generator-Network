Arsenal's Mesut Ozil ranks alongside Chelsea's Eden Hazard as Europe's joint-top attacking midfielder in 2015, a study has found.

Ozil's performances in the Barclays Premier League led to him being labelled a 'flop' previously, but rankings by CIES Football Observatory suggest the £42.5million player is pulling his weight.

The statistical research group compiled rankings for the position based on shooting, chances created, take-ons, distribtuon, recovery and rigour, and gave Ozil and Hazard a score of 100 each.

It follows Ozil revealing he is 'convinced' he can win the Ballon d'Or within the next few years.

The German World Cup winner moved to Arsenal from Real Madrid in September 2013, and has been trying to adapt to the 'physical test' of the Premier League.

'If I continue to develop well and stay healthy, I would like, in the next few years, to hold the Ballon d’Or in my hands. I am convinced that it can happen,' Ozil told Sport Bild.

'I’m feeling very positive. I’m a world champion and I play at a top club in the Premier League.

'There is much more of a physical test here than there is in Spain or in the Bundesliga – I constantly have bruises, but that makes me harder. I feel physically better than ever.'

The 26-year-old, currently on international duty with Germany, made headlines for the wrong reasons previously after being spotted in a Berlin nightclub just hours after missing Arsenal’s Premier League win over Newcastle United due to a cold. 

Ozil has not scored in all competitions since February 7 and has three Premier League goals to his name this season, while Hazard has 11.
