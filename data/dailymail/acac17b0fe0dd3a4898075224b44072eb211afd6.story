Having the name ‘Brian’ might not seem like the most promising start in life.

But in fact, the name – which is instantly associated with the Monty Python classic The Life of Brian – has the best ‘credit rating’ in Britain, according to a report published yesterday.

Women with the name Helen also tend to have a good credit rating, as do those who live in the gold-plated postcode of SL4 in Windsor, home of David Cameron’s former school, Eton College.

Best credit rating: The name Brian, which is instantly associated with Monty Python classic The Life of Brian (pictured), has the best 'credit rating' in Britain

The report, from the comparison website confused.com, looked at the records of tens of thousands of people to work out the names and addresses of those with the best credit record.

It found people called Brian, Alan, Ian, Peter and Robert are the least likely to have a black spot on their credit history, such as being made bankrupt or missing their mortgage payment.

This is because credit histories tend to be better among older people, who were brought up to avoid debt, to save and to spend only what they can afford, and worse among the young.

And for most people, these are the names of their fathers or grandfathers, but not their boyfriends, husbands or sons.

In fact, official records show that just one of these five names - Peter - appears in the top 100 of the most popular baby names in England and Wales last year.

Young parents are more likely to call their baby Harry, Oliver, Jack, Alfie and Charlie, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The name Brian has gradually slipped down the rankings of the most popular name from seventh position in 1944 to 51st by 1974, 87th in 1984 before falling out of the top 100 in 1994.

For women, the top five names with the best credit history are Helen, Susan, Julie, Elizabeth and Joanne.

The report says the people with the best credit histories have the postcode SL4 one of the exclusive postcodes in Britain.

This is the postcode of Winsor Castle, one of the Queen’s homes, and also Eton College, the leading boys’ private school which charges fees - before extras - of around £32,000 a year.

Other top addresses are Guildford, Manchester, Southend-on-Sea and Portsmouth, with losers in Swansea, Birmingham, Torquay, Edinburgh and Wolverhampton.

The worst names to have are Daniel, Lee, Matthew, Steven and Christopher. For women, the worst one are Lisa, Victoria, Emma, Nicola and Claire.

Nerys Lewis, head of credit cards at Confused.com, said: ‘While our research shows the names with the best and worst credit profiles in the UK, people’s names are obviously not a rating factor when looking at credit.

‘If you’re called Brian, you won’t automatically be gifted with a great profile or penalised because your name is Lisa.’

The report is based on the financial records of tens of thousands of people who used the website’s credit card checking service between January and August this year.
