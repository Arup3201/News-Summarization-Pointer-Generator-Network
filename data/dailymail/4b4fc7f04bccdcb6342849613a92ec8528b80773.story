Tragic: Senior bank manager Michael Foreman, 48, died when he fell 100ft from the Tate Modern

A senior bank manager with a fear of heights plunged 100 feet to his death from a private members' balcony at the Tate Modern while four times over the drink drive limit.

Michael Foreman, 48, had been drinking wine in the art gallery's bar for an hour before he was seen striding determinedly toward the railing and plunging off the London building from the balcony on the fifth floor.

A coroner returned an open verdict after he heard that there was no sign given to the family of the impending tragedy and his judgement would have been impaired by alcohol.

His father Stephen told Southwark Coroners Court: 'He lived an ordinary life, he was a very particular sort of person, he wanted to do everything correctly in the right way and that is how he went on in life until as far as we know that last moment.

'He showed no sign of distress or anxiety at all and to this moment how this happened, and in particular why this happened, is a complete mystery to us and to the rest of his family in company with everybody who knew him.

'It is completely indescribable what has happened and he gave no indication as to anything untoward that would lead to such a set of circumstances.'

Mr Foreman, who was not a regular visitor to the Tate but worked next door, was reported missing by HSBC on July 23, the court heard.

On July 24 he was seen sitting in the members bar of the Tate Modern drinking wine for roughly an hour by staff before they began closing the terrace.

Friends Victoria Young and Josephine Kelly were the only other people left outside when the suited man strode up to them, climbed over the railings and fell to his death.

Ms Young said she saw him take a couple of strides 'as though he was taking a run up' before he jumped.

She said: 'He appeared very determined, there was no way anyone could have stopped him.'

Paramedics who rushed to the scene could see it was too late to attempt resuscitation.

The post mortem found he had 300mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - four times the drink drive limit - which the coroner noted would have left him 'unsteady' and with 'poor judgement'.

His wife Janet, who also works at HSBC, said he was a very 'private man' who worked hard and enjoyed his hobbies, and they had no problems or arguments and a 'good family life'.

He was a trombonist in the Tilbury brass band in Essex, where they lived together, and also used to play regularly with The Aveley and Newham Band in east London and was looking forward to appearing on a TV show with the band.

When she heard he was dead she was 'absolutely shocked' and she could think of 'absolutely nothing' which would have prompted him to jump.

Mrs Foreman said: 'It was not in his character at all to have done something like that to himself, especially since he didn't like heights, if he went to the edge of a building he would get dizzy.'

Mr Foreman, who had no history of mental illness, had not left a note, sent a text message or given any indication of what was about to happen.

'It was not in his normal character or personality that meant he would even consider disappearing then taking his own life in such a dramatic way,' she told the court.

He died during a busy period for the gallery with shows by artists Damien Hirst and Edvard Munch taking place.

A statement from his boss Nadya Hijazi, Head of Global Interactive E-channels at HSBC, said he was doing well at work and was being praised and receiving good bonuses to confirm his success.

Mr Hijazi added: 'Not only was he highly respected by his colleagues and managers but well liked by all. He will be sadly missed by all his colleagues both professionally and personally.'

Coroner Andrew Harris noted that 'too all intents and purposes he had a happy life', adding in his verdict 'he was under the influence of alcohol and there is no evidence of intent or suspicious circumstances'.
