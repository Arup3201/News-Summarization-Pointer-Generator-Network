When artist Alessandro Diddi puts pencil to paper, his works really come to life.

His clever 3-D drawings are achieved by a trick of the mind, using shading and angles to give them a life of their own and make them 'leap off the page'.

'I want my drawings to put across the message that the eye can trick the mind and make you believe that there are dimensions that are not really there,' said Mr Diddi.

The drawings are a trick of the mind created by the designer, who said he wanted to create dimensions that weren't really there

Using his own hands and objects to make the drawings appear even more life-like, they appear to show two men using their strength to pull a pencil out of the artist's hand, as well as a snake slithering away as its being drawn.

Another shows Mr Diddi's fingers turn into claws and ripping the paper, while a different drawing indicates the designer trying to slam down the paper on a struggling man. 

He said: 'When people see my drawings they are often pleasantly surprised, they fail to understand exactly how I've managed to achieve the 3D look.

'When you understand the mechanism of the anamorphic design, you realise that putting together drawing like this is really not so difficult.

'My goal is always to create something new and original, which people will want to look at and feel intrigued by. 

'By simply trying to combine my two passions: the freehand drawing and three-dimensional representation, I was able to come up with these different designs.

The artist said all you need is a pencil and something to draw on to create something 'really magical'

'Although there is no message I'm trying to get across through my drawings, I do think it's important that people realise it is not necessary to consume a large amount of resources to achieve something interesting. 

'All you need is a pencil and something to draw on, and you can create something really magical.'
