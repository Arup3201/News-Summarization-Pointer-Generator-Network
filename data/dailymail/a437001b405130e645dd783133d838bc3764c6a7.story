A Victorian plumber who received an entire hand transplant three years ago says the process was so successful he has almost forgotten he had no hands to begin with.

Peter Walsh, 68, was the first Australian and oldest person in the world to receive the hand transplant back in March 2011.

Despite his new hand remaining numb for two months following the nine-hour operation, Mr Walsh said he had adapted well and could now write, feed himself, and attach his prosthetic limbs.

'I almost forget I had no hands now,' he told ninemsn.

'I can do things for myself. A few things I can't do with one hand, like it's hard to put a coat on. Things like that I still (need a hand with).

'I can put both my prosthetic legs on… the hardest I find is to put my socks on.'

Doctors were forced to amputate both of Mr Walsh's hands and feet back in 2006 after he was struck down with pneumococcal sepsis, a bacterial infection that saw him placed in an induced coma.

He woke from the coma to find his limbs dying in front of his eyes.

He doesn't know how old his hand is but does know it belonged to a mountain climber.

Before the operation at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne, brain scans showed basically a blank area because he hadn't needed to use his hand for several years.

But the same area has begun to 'wake up' in the years following the transplant.

'I've had two CT scans since and it improved both times,' Mr Walsh said.
