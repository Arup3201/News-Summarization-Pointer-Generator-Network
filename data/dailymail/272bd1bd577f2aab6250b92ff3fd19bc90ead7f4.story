Offensive ‘tribute’ pages devoted to alleged criminals on Facebook will not be tolerated as the social networking site takes a strong stance against internet trolls. 

It comes after a man was arrested for allegedly creating a tribute page for Dale Cregan, the alleged killer of police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.

Simon Milner, Facebook’s director of policy, said there was ‘no grey area’ when it came to the offensive tribute pages and that immediate action will be taken against anyone who deliberately sets up such a group.

Strong stance: Facebook will not tolerate offensive tribute pages to alleged criminals such as this page set up by an internet troll praising Dale Cregan, the man who allegedly shot dead two policewomen

Police arrested and questioned a man in September under the Communications Act 2003 after they traced the Facebook page ‘Dale Cregan is a Hero’ back to his home.

The page contained posts which mocked the deaths of policewomen Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.

One read: ‘So a pair of coppers got killed who gives a s***?’ 

Another internet troll, who described Cregan as a ‘legend,’ stood by his comments, comparing the murder suspect to crazed killer Raoul Moat. 

This week, Facebook made changes to the way members could report their concerns about posts.

Reporting posts: Facebook has made changes to the way members report their concerns about posts

For the first time people who make complaints can keep track of Facebook’s response using a new ‘support dashboard’.

The system has been tested since April and this week it was made available to all one billion members.

Online bully: Sean Duffy admitted defacing a tribute page for a teenager who was accidentally shot and was accused of posting fake photos of her with bullet holes in her head

Mr Milner told The Telegraph that
 the new system will be especially useful in alleged bullying cases on 
Facebook because moderators often find it hard to deem whether a post is
 designed to be hurtful and the changes will make it easier for members 
to challenge decisions.

Mr Milner said: ‘Only a small minority of our users ever report problems.

‘This will just increase transparency around how we respond to those that do.’

Earlier this year an online bully, who targeted dead teenagers and cruelly mocked their deaths, has been spared jail and banned from social networking sites today for 'trolling' about a tragic schoolgirl.

Sean Duffy, 26, from Reading, Berkshire, had admitted defacing a tribute site set up to remember Sophie Taylor, 16, between April 18 and 20 last year. 

The teenager was shot accidentally by her boyfriend, 18-year-old trainee gamekeeper Calum Murray, who then turned the gun on himself at a cottage near Tomintoul, Moray in Scotland, that month.

Duffy, an autistic alcoholic, was accused of posting fake photos of Sophie with bullet holes in her head.

He earlier admitted he was hooked on 'trolling' – where internet users deliberately leave abusive and bullying comments on networking sites to provoke others.

He was sentenced to a community payback order with supervision for two years and told to do 300 hours of unpaid work.

He is also banned from creating any accounts on social networking sites and is not allowed to post any videos or buy any device with internet access.
