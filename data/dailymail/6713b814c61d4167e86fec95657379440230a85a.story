Vanished: Madeleine McCann disappeared from Praia da Luz in Portugal in 2007

The News of the World’s former editor said yesterday he believed he had permission to publish the extracts from Kate McCann’s diary that she later said had left her feeling ‘mentally raped’.

Colin Myler said he was told he had full support for publishing a story from Clarence Mitchell, the press spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared from Praia da Luz, in Portugal, in 2007.

Mr Myler told the Leveson press standards inquiry he had ‘nothing to gain and everything to lose’ from upsetting the couple, having developed a good relationship with them.

Mr Myler, who edited the News of the World from 2007 until it closed this year, said: ‘I stressed that I did not want Kate to come out of church on Sunday morning and find that the diaries were there without her knowledge.’

Mrs McCann’s diary was published in the News of the World on September 14, 2008.

She told the inquiry last month that 
when she saw it published she felt ‘violated’. Her husband said: ‘Kate 
was distraught and in her words felt “mentally raped”.’

The
 McCanns said Mr Mitchell was told by the paper’s Head of News Ian 
Edmondson that it was planning to run a ‘supportive story’ but not that 
it would publish the diary.

Mr Edmondson, who has since been arrested as part of the phone-hacking inquiry, told Mr Myler the diary was obtained from a Portuguese journalist.

Asked why he did not phone Mr McCann to check if permission had been given, Mr Myler said: ‘Because Ian Edmondson had assured me on more than one occasion that Clarence [Mitchell] was aware of what we were intending to do.’

After the diary was printed, Mr Myler ran an apology in the paper ‘because I felt very bad that she didn’t know’, he said.

Speaking after yesterday’s hearing, Mr Mitchell said: ‘At no point in the one brief call that I received from Ian Edmondson on the Friday evening before publication did he spell out categorically that they had purchased a version of Kate’s diary that had been leaked by the Portuguese police and that they were planning to publish it in as big a way as they subsequently did.’
