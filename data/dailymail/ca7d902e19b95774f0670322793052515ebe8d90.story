Feckless fathers should have their benefits slashed if they refuse to support their children, senior Tories said yesterday.

Former minister Sir Gerald Howarth said action was needed to cut the £46billion of damage caused to society by the collapse of relationships.

Citing statistics showing married parents are far more likely to stay together than those who are cohabiting, he said ministers should be ‘more judgmental’ about family breakdowns.

Father of 22 Raymond Hull has not worked for 10 years but cost taxpayers £1.2million in unemployment handouts and housing benefits

And he suggested that fathers who refuse to support the upbringing of their children should have their benefits cut if they are on state handouts.

Opening a Commons debate, Sir Gerald highlighted the case of father of 22 Raymond Hull, who was last week revealed to have cost the state £1.2million in benefits.

He then listed a string of cases from his Hampshire constituency of mothers and children abandoned by their deadbeat partners.

‘We are not talking about a deprived inner city area – this is Aldershot,’ he said. ‘We cannot afford to continue subsidising people with dysfunctional lifestyles.

'Am I being judgmental when such an approach is deemed inappropriate? Of course I’m being judgmental – for the sake of our country we need to be more judgmental.’

Sir Gerald cited Marriage Foundation figures showing that family breakdown now costs Britain an astonishing £46billion a year – up from £30billion in 2000.

The figure comprises the impact of lower educational achievements, higher crime rates, pressure on housing stocks and healthcare and a higher benefits bill.

Sir Gerald said figures from the Centre for Social Justice suggested that while fewer than one in ten  married couples separate before their child’s fifth birthday, one in three cohabiting couples will do so.

He said successive governments had been too scared of popular opinion and failed to take heed of impartial evidence that marriage is in the interest of society. And he urged ministers to send a ‘clarion call’ that marriage provided the most stable bedrock for a family.

Fellow grandee Sir Edward Leigh also urged ministers to speak out against the ‘modern plague’ of  relationship breakdown.

‘There is almost a conspiracy of silence about this issue,’ he said. ‘Over 50 years, in our permissive society, the view has grown up that people are happiest, they are completely liberated, and they do what they want to do – it’s about “me”.

‘And I believe that the churches, successive governments, schools, the BBC, national newspapers, ourselves as members of parliament, are all complicit in this permissive view of society which  has actually left a trail of despair in its wake.’
