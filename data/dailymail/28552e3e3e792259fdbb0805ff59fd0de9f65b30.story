Opinionated: Jennifer Saunders, pictured with her husband Adrian Edmondson, believes it is important that children are disciplined by their parents

As Britain’s top comedienne, it’s not difficult for Jennifer Saunders to see the funny side of life.

But parenting is one subject that she does not consider a laughing matter.

The Absolutely Fabulous star has revealed that she has no time for modern child rearing which she claims prevents parents from disciplining their children and setting boundaries.

Miss Saunders, 55, who has three daughters with her husband Adrian Edmondson, said: ‘That ‘conscious parenting’ is rather odd, where you spend ‘quality time’.

'They [children] have to learn what life is like, that people have bad moods. People get cross. If I’m tired, and you’re pushing it, I’m going to shout.’

And referring to the need to teach children the importance of responsibility rather than being kind, she added: ‘If you want a pony, even if it’s wet and dark, you go out there and you do your bloody pony.’

The actress, also best known for her comedy partnership with Dawn French, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 following a routine mammogram. Tests revealed it to be several malignant lumps.

Miss Saunders underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Following the treatment she was given Tamoxifen which she has revealed plunged her straight into menopause and depression.

In her interview with the Saturday Times magazine she said: ‘I just thought that I was cross and that the whole world was wrong. Everyone was being stupid.’

Miss Saunders, who has written a new book, Bonkers: My Life in Laughs, is still taking an anti-depressant.

Controversially she claims some people like to wear cancer like a badge: ‘I’ll give you why. Because it’s the job you don’t have to work for. You suddenly get so much attention and if you’re not used to that, I bet it can sway you a little bit.

‘I’m used to it! My job gives me the attention I would otherwise crave. They must be so p***ed off when their hair grows back. And you think, ‘Oh, come on, cancer is so common now.’
