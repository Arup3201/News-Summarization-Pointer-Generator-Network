They gave more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes to a charity shop in an attempt to raise money for survivors of the Philippines disaster last month.

But many of David and Victoria Beckham’s donations have ended up in far less honourable hands.

When the sale opened 11 days ago at a British Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea, hundreds of fans queued around the block in a bid to get their hands on the famous couple’s rare designer items.

However, several shameless shoppers went straight home to sell their bargains online, with some making more than twenty times the sale price in profit.

Economics student, Jordan Silverstone, is one of many who has been criticised for cashing in on the stars’ good nature.

He bought David’s tailored Saville Row tuxedo for just £125 which he has now sold for £2,600 on auction website, eBay.

The unique item was hand-fitted for football star and worth at least £4,000 – but David had deliberately decided to sell it on for an affordable price so that normal people could afford it.

The 22-year-old queued for one and a half hours to get the suit - which Beckham wore to the Sun’s Military Awards in 2011, where he was pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge.

He claims he originally bought the William Hunt tuxedo for his father Matthew’s 53rd birthday, but when he got it home he realised his father would be ‘too fat’ for it.

So he decided he would sell it on, keeping three quarters of the profit – for a day out with his father and to put towards paying off his student loan. The rest, he said, he will give to charity.

But the Nottingham University student has received abuse through social media sites and on eBay accusing him of cashing in on a charitable gesture.

Nazaneen Ghaffer, a Sky News weather presenter, said on Twitter that if an item doesn’t fit, people should ‘just sell them for what he/she paid’ – not make a profit.

But Mr Silverstone responded, saying: ‘It is absolute nonsense. If I keep the suit and leave it in my Dad’s wardrobe never to be worn then that is okay, but if I sell it on to a buyer who really wants it that isn’t?'

He added: ‘Where is the logic behind that? It’s rich of anyone to knock someone else’s charitable donations.

Nazaneen Ghaffer poses pictures of her exotic holidays in Dubai on Twitter – is someone having a go at her for not giving this money to starving children? No.’

He said: ‘From an economics point of view, it makes complete sense.

‘It doesn’t fit my dad, so we want to sell it to someone who can get value out of it as that’s better than it being unused.

‘This way I can raise more money for charity than I already have by buying the tux and make a profit to do something nice with my dad.’

But Mr Silverstone isn’t the only one making a profit.

Among other items that have been in online auctions are Victoria’s white platform trainers that she wore at the Dodgers Mets game on 7th June 2007.

Despite the new owner paying less than £50 for them, bids started at £1,000.

And another eBay user is selling a pair of Victoria’s Gianni Versace black heels for £330.

Only 150 shoppers were allowed in to the charity shop near Kings Road in Chelsea on November 22, then it was one-in-one out as men and women lined up for hours waiting for their chance to grab a bargain.

More than 500 donated items went on sale, incuding designs by Dolce & Gabbana, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo, which started at just £25.

The couple also donated their famous matching Dickensian outfits worn at the Venice Film Festival in 2006.

Posting photos of her piles of discarded clothes ahead of the giveaway on her Twitter page, Victoria wrote: ‘Proud to support @BritishRedCross #ShopDrop Donating clothes for #Haiyan survivors.’

Victoria, who spent the weekend before last sorting through her wardrobe, has been urging others to follow her example and donate their old clothes.
