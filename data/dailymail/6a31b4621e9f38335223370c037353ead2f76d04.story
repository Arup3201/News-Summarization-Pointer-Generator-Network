There was a standing ovation for her son as he arrived on Centre Court as the first British man to defend a Wimbledon singles title for 77 years.

But up in the stands on Monday, Andy Murray’s mother Judy was getting ready to become the star of the show herself.

Mrs Murray is said to be in the ‘advanced stage’ of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing.

Murray is said to be in the 'advanced stage' of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing

The 54-year-old is a big fan of the BBC programme and often posts saucy comments about its male performers on her Twitter account.

A source said: ‘The final line-up is due to be announced in four weeks’ time and Judy is a long way down in talks to appear on it.’

Her son was also left aghast  in 2011 
when Mrs Murray  posted a series of tweets praising the good looks of 
his Spanish Wimbledon opponent  Feliciano Lopez.

In
 a rare outburst, Murray declared: ‘I think it’s about time that she 
stopped that nonsense. It’s making me throw up. It’s disgusting.’

If
 his mother does appear in this autumn’s Strictly, she will have to fit 
it around her duties as captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup Team.

Mrs
 Murray trained Andy and his older brother Jamie – now a successful 
doubles player – on public courts in their home town of Dunblane.

Her friend and former British tennis number one Andrew Castle, who appeared on Strictly in 2008, has described Mrs Murray as  a ‘Strictly nut’ who would jump at the chance of appearing on  the programme.

But he fears her 27-year-old son will 
be left squirming with embarrassment at his mother’s antics on screen 
and would be better off watching the show ‘through his fingers’.

She is credited with passing on her 
competitive spirit to her sons, and is often seen in the crowd 
fist-pumping and making faces during big points.

Mrs
 Murray – who once received vile hate mail accusing her of being a pushy
 parent – was greeted by embraces from friends and adoring fans alike as
 she watched her son sail into second round yesterday in a straight sets
 win over Belgian David Goffin.

And
 if she had felt any parental anxiety ahead of the clash, she hid it 
well, laughing and joking with fans queuing outside Centre Court.

She
 was joined by her son’s girlfriend Kim Sears and  his new coach Amélie 
Mauresmo to watch him defeat Goffin, 23, who is ranked 105 in the world.

Prior to the match, Judy tweeted a photograph of Mauresmo and Murray in matching T-shirts and nicknamed the duo ‘Murresmo’.

Last week she told of her ‘survivor’s guilt’ over the Dunblane massacre in 1996, when 16 children and a teacher were killed at the school attended by her sons.

Mrs Murray, who is divorced from her children’s father Willie, said she still becomes emotional when she revisits the town to talk about ‘everything that Andy and Jamie have achieved’.
