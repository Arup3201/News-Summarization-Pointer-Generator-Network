After President Barack Obama hilariously mixed up their names last week, there were hopes that George Osborne and U.S. soul star Jeffrey Osborne might have formed a lasting friendship.

However, things aren’t going too well, according to Britain’s Chancellor, who revealed today that he has been approached by the other Osborne to sing in a duet and play golf - but he can’t do either.

It comes after President Obama repeatedly referred to George Osborne as ‘Jeffrey’ - known in the UK for little more than a one-off hit in the 1980s - during G8 meetings in Northern Ireland last week.

The Chancellor told BBC One today: ‘He's asked
me for a duet, and sadly I can't sing. He's now asked me for a game of 
golf, but I can't play golf. So it's not going very well, this new 
friendship.’

He added, speaking to The Andrew Marr 
Show: ‘It's nice to be on first-name terms with the President
of the United States - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong. That's the way I look at it.’

Mr Osborne had jetted into the second 
day of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, determined to impress the 
world’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax
dodgers.

But his pride suffered a major setback
when the leader of the free world got him confused with R&B star 
Jeffrey Osborne - who most famously sang the 1982 hit On The Wings of 
Love.

Mr Obama called him ‘Jeffrey’ three times, to the visible embarrassment of the Chancellor.

‘It was obvious Osborne didn’t like 
being called “Jeffrey”,’ a government source said last week. ‘Why would 
he? His name is George.’

Confused: US President Obama later apologised to the Chancellor for getting in a muddle about his name

In fact the Chancellor’s real name is Gideon Oliver Osborne but switched to George aged 13 as a ‘small act of rebellion’.

Last week the soul singer said he was 
delighted to get a name-check at the G8 summit. And in a bizarre twist 
suggested singing a duet up with the Chancellor.

'He's asked me for a duet, and sadly I can't sing. He's now asked me for a game of golf, but I can't play golf. So it's not going very well, this new friendship'

Chancellor George Osborne

Jeffrey Osborne told Sky News: 'I was 
really delighted, actually. I was really not aware that he was that much
of a fan that he would call the Chancellor Jeffrey Osborne.

'Tell the Chancellor when I come over I
will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of On The Wings Of 
Love, or something.'

Jeffrey Osborne's entry in online 
encyclopaedia Wikipedia was tampered with by a mischievous user to reflect Mr 
Obama's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the Treasury.

After being edited, the entry 
read: 'Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American funk 
and R&B musician, songwriter, lyricist, former lead singer of the 
band, L.T.D., and as of June 2013, is the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
and Second Lord of the Treasury of the United Kingdom.'

Joke: Mr Osborne has now seen the funny side of the President's slip-up, which was the talk of Westminster

The bogus information remained online 
for under an hour before being erased. The name gaffe by Mr Obama came 
despite Mr Osborne boasting of his close links with the White House.

After delivering a 90-minute 
presentation on global data-sharing plans to stop companies and 
individual’s hiding their profits in tax havens, Mr Osborne was left 
deflated when Mr Obama responded: ‘Thanks for that, Jeffrey.’

'It's nice to be on first-name terms with the President of the United States - even if he sometimes gets the name wrong. That's the way I look at it'

Chancellor George Osborne

But the two men could not be more 
different. The Chancellor is the son of Sir Peter Osborne, 17th baronet 
of Ballintaylor and Ballylemon.

By contrast the father of 
singer-songwriter Jeffrey Osborne was Clarence ‘Legs’ Osborne, a trumpet
player who played with Duke Ellington and Count Basie.

He had a total of 12 children but died
when Jeffrey was just 13. In an attempt to make amends, Mr Obama 
insisted that he did know Mr Osborne’s name really.

‘I’m sorry, man. I must have confused you with my favourite R&B singer,’ he said.
