Gomis is keen to leave Swansea and could be set to join West Ham during the January transfer window

Crystal Palace have made offers for Gomis but the 29-year-old was reluctant to move to Selhurst Park. He has also been offereed to Schalke and Borussia Dortmund.

Swansea boss Garry Monk insisted Gomis would stay and see out the season after losing Wilfried Bony to Manchester City.

Swansea have signed Nelson Oliveira on loan from Benfica but see Gomis as their main striker. They do hold an interest in Rudy Gestede of Blackburn however after going cool on a deal for Jordan Rhodes.
