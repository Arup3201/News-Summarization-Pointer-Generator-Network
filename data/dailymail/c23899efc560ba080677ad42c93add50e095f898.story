Accusation: British model Emma Appleton appears to have uploaded and then deleted a very suggestive message she claims is from photographer Terry Richardson which she uploaded to social media on Sunday

A British model has claimed celebrity photographer Terry Richardson offered her the opportunity to pose for fashion bible Vogue in exchange for sex.

Emma Appleton claims the seedy offer was made from the photographer’s Facebook account on Sunday and involved a shoot in Richardson's hometown of New York City.

His spokeswoman said the message is a fake and denied her client's involvement.

Appleton uploaded the grab to Twitter on Sunday afternoon - setting off a flurry of shocked replies from her followers before she deleted her entire account and took the picture off her Instagram page.

'If I can f*** you I will book you in ny (sic) for a. (sic) shoot for Vogue,' reads the message grabbed by Appleton - which she claims was from the photographer who has been dogged by claims of sexual harassment over the years.

While it is not clear whether Richardson, who counts Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga as some of his photographic muses, is responsible for the message, Appleton explained in more detail to her followers what happened after the offer was made.

'I was like whaat and he said yes or no?', replied Appleton to one Twitter user, @lewisthegreat.

When asked what she then said, Appleton said that she declined the offer with a simple, 'no, I'm not your girl, bye ha.'

Shocking: This is the message - with offending language blurred out - that Terry Richardson was accused of sending to Emma Appleton on Sunday

Appleton, who hails from Witney, Oxfordshire and splits her time between there and London then said she felt the 'industry is f****d up'.

One appalled Twitter follower of Appleton said, 'I've been modelling for 5 years and I've never had this before, it doesn't make it okay.'

As her account was inundated with replies, some which appeared to be unsupportive of her, Appleton then bemoaned the fact that she had even uploaded the grab.

Before she deleted her account, she signed off with, 'The fact people think this acceptable blows my f*****g mind. See ya.'

Candice Marks, a spokesperson for Richardson denied the message was real and said that the photographer did not send the message.

'This is obviously a fake. Terry did not send this text,' said Marks to Buzzfeed.

A spokesperson for Vogue, who Richardson shot for in February, said that the magazine would not be commenting on the situation at the moment.

Despite many accusations of sexual harassment in the past, Richardson has never been charged, or convicted of any crime in connection with any allegations.

He continues to work at the highest echelons of the fashion industry with luminaries such as Lady Gaga singing his praises after collaborating with him.

In March he called claims that he has acted inappropriately with models he has worked with as 'a witch hunt'.

The high-profile snapper has worked with Barack Obama, Rhianna, Justin Bieber and Beyoncé and in the past has been described as an 'alleged sexual predator' and even a 'creep' by some celebrities.

The New York Post obtained a letter in which the Rolling Stone, Vogue and GQ photographer called the allegations against him, 'false, hate-filled and libelous tales'.

In relation to the years of allegations against him: 'I chose to primarily ignore a cycle of Internet gossip and false accusations against me.

'I felt that to dignify them with a response was a betrayal of my work and my character.

'When
 these allegations resurfaced over the past few months, they seemed 
especially vicious and distorted, becoming nothing more than an 
emotionally-charged witch hunt.

'People have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales

'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors.

Richardson has called allegations that he has taken advantage of young models for sexual gain 'a cycle of internet gossip'

'Without my voice, all that remain are the lies.'

Friends: Terry Richardson with pop superstar Miley Cyrus - one of his many subjects over the years

Danish model Rie Rasmussen said that 
the girls who work with Richardson 'are too afraid to say no because 
their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for 
themselves.'

‘He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of.

‘His “look” is girls who appear underage, abused, look like heroin addicts . . . I don’t understand how anyone works with him.’

Canadian model Liskula Cohen walked off a Vogue shoot with Richardson after his requests became more and more explicit.

In an 
interview with the New Statesman, she described how the men joining her 
on the shoot were not models or actors, but friends of Richardson, and 
soon he was requesting that she perform mock sex acts.

She said: 'He wanted me to be completely naked and pretend to give one of the men a sex act, while he was also naked.'

She also gave advice to models who might
 be working with Richardson in the future: 'Bring a body guard, keep 
your clothes on, and if he exposes himself call the police.'

Richardson is also known for launching a new look for Miley Cyrus with 22 highly explicit images publish last year of the pop star parading around an unfurnished New York studio in various states of undress.

In one of the sets, Richardson persuaded the singer to perform a sordid-looking sex act on an ice cream cone.
