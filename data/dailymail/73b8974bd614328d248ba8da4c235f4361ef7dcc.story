After missing his third cut in as many tournaments in Aberdeen last week, Lee Westwood conceded that his preparation for the 143rd Open Championship was less than ideal.

In Hoylake on Wednesday he remained every bit as candid, giving an interview that opened a portal into what at times sounded like a rather troubled mind; at the very least the mind of a 41-year-old golfer wrestling with one or two issues at what appears to be a bit of a crossroads in his career.

He spoke with refreshing honesty, not least when it came to responding to recent comments made by Paul McGinley.

Form: Westwood knows he must show what he's made of to make the cut for the Ryder Cup team

Any tips? Westwod took time out to watch the World Cup and get away from the tense golfing scene

The Ryder Cup captain said the former world No 1 needed to show a bit of ‘form’ to earn selection for Gleneagles, and Westwood thought that fair enough.

Indeed, Westwood said he would not want to be considered if he failed to start playing better, for fear of ‘letting down his team-mates’.

In Scotland last week, Westwood pointed to a three-week break as a reason for failing to make the cut. After a busy start to the year, he said he had been feeling jaded going into tournaments and required a complete break from the day job.

‘I needed to put the clubs away and not even think about golf,’ he told Sportsmail on Wednesday. ‘So I just spent time with my family. I watched a lot of the World Cup and we had some friends over from England for my wife’s 40th birthday.’ (Westwood lives in Florida).

Because he did not hit a single ball during that period he was, by his own admission, ‘rusty’ in Aberdeen.

By Wednesday he was pleased to report that he was happier with his swing. But it remains an introspective Westwood who tees off at 2.38pm on Thursday.

Concentration: Westwood had a three-week break from all things golf to recover

Every player goes into a major hoping to win but in Ryder Cup year there is an extra incentive.

Westwood, however, is applying a touch of realism to his situation and sounds like he would be happy enough just to be striking the ball sweetly again.

‘Listen, I want to show some form,’ he said when reminded of McGinley’s remarks.

‘I’ve got some big events  coming up and I’d still like to qualify for the (Ryder Cup) team. I feel like I can do that if I can get my game in shape. But if I did need a pick I’d want to be playing well.’

What he wouldn’t want is to be selected on reputation alone; on his fine record as a veteran of eight Ryder Cups.

‘No, I wouldn’t want that,’ he said. ‘You don’t want to let down your team-mates by playing poorly. And obviously if you get picked there’s a lot of added pressure to perform. You’ve got to justify your pick.’

Right now Westwood would not appear to know if he is playing well, even if those close to him would suggest he has been feeling more satisfied about his game than he is perhaps letting on.

With his son, Sam, for company in practice this week he has actually been attacking the course with the precision and creativity it demands.

‘You just have to be realistic about your game sometimes,’ he said. ‘I’ve been struggling with my swing a little bit recently.

‘I’ve been trying to make a few changes but obviously it’s hard to compete when it’s like that. I played a lot at the start of the year and I didn’t really give myself enough time off. I was feeling a bit mentally jaded. I’m still motivated. I’m still practising just as hard.

'I want to play. But you’ve got to feel fresh going into the tournaments. And I just wasn’t getting the balance right between working hard and taking time off.

‘That’s why I took three weeks off. I was supposed to play in the middle week in Washington but I decided not to in the end. I needed to work on my game but I also needed a break. It was just a case of which one I needed more.’

It all sounds perfectly reasonable. A sensible decision by a sensible man. But then he says something that suggests he is still wrestling with some fairly major issues.

‘In golf you’ve got to retain that keenness,’ he said. ‘Physically I feel the same as ever. But when you get to a certain age it becomes a balancing act. Do you still want to work hard at your game?

‘You’ve got 21-year-old kids who are dedicating their whole life to their game. When you’ve got a family, a wife and kids, you have to compartmentalise it a lot better.

Focus: Westwood says he finds it difficult to dedicate himself to the game with a family to look after

'I’ve been doing a bit of work with my coach over the last three or four days and I feel like I’ve found something I can take on to the golf course. I saw Ross Mackenzie (his sports psychologist) on Wednesday. That helps. Ross has given me a few pointers to take out there.’

Westwood says he can take encouragement from his performance in last year’s Open, even if it did end in crushing disappointment after going into the final round at Muirfield with a two-stroke lead. ‘I didn’t feel I played that well at Muirfield,’ he said.

‘I putted really well. But I don’t feel like I’ve struck the ball as well as I’d like to for a couple of years now. Certainly not well enough to win tournaments on a consistent basis.

‘And the fact that I’ve still managed to keep winning the odd tournament and play  consistently means the mental attitude going into tournaments is right. I just need to start hitting the ball better.’ Even so, he does appear flatter than a potential winner of this championship perhaps should.

‘I’m not flat,’ he insisted with a flash of defiance. ‘I’m always keen to do well and I go into every major trying to win. I like links golf. I look forward to this time of year.

'And in three out of the last five years I’ve been in the top three. So if I start playing well I expect to be in contention.’

And not just for The Open.
