Steve McClaren's target for 2015 is all too obvious: a return to the top flight. And he was provided with further confidence that his Derby side have what it takes for promotion with the kind of convincing display that has been expected of them during his 14-month tenure.

Alex Mowatt’s own goal before the break and a Jake Buxton header shortly after half-time ensured Leeds were never in this contest.

It was a night for Derby fans to savour as they enjoyed a seventh straight home win over their old rivals in front of a season’s best crowd of 31,690, even more than watched the recent defeat to Chelsea.

McClaren had hailed 2014 as one of his best 12 months in football prior to this match – despite defeat in the play-off final to QPR in May - as he hunted a 27th victory to finish the calendar year in style.

Leeds had beaten Derby 2-0 at Elland Road earlier this year but their evening got off to a bad start as left back Stephen Warnock injured himself tackling Cyrus Christie and he was replaced by Gaetano Berardi with just eight minutes on the clock.

Derby had the better of the play but this game lacked much in the way of clearcut chances early on with Souleymane Doukara seeing an effort blocked for the visitors while at the other end Will Hughes was also denied by a firm Leeds defence.

On-loan Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe was not punished despite going down easily in the area while Tommaso Bianchi curled wide from distance and Mirco Antenucci went close for Leeds. But they went on to concede in calamitous fashion on 40 minutes.

Hughes burst down the left and his low, teasing cross struck Cooper and then hit Mowatt before beating Marco Silvestri via the crossbar. It was the second game running that Leeds had conceded an own goal.

And up until that point they had been more than in the game.

Derby were buoyed by the goal and could have extended their lead before the break. Captain Richard Keogh’s header from Jeff Hendrick’s free kick was well saved by Silvestri before Ibe shot wide from the edge of the area.

The game was as good as up for Leeds at the start of the second half though. Buxton strained to reach a Hendrick 47th-minute free kick but got his head well to the ball to leave Silvestri well beaten.

It was his first goal since November 2013 but he still received more red cards this season – two – than he has found the net.

Things looked like they would get even worse for Leeds with confidence visibly draining out of them. Ibe went close to Derby’s third as his long ranger was pushed away by Silvestri.

Chances kept coming for Derby as Leeds wilted despite their fanatical support and Ibe headed wide from another pinpoint Christie cross but the fact it was not total humiliation will at least give Leeds’ fanatical supporters something to cheer.
