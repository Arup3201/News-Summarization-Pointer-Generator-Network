A Minnesota schoolboy has become an internet hit after presenting the weather on his local television station.

William Hallman, nine, charmed viewers of North Dakota station KVLY when he assisted chief meteorologist Hutch Johnson in front of the weather map last Thursday.

The YouTube video of his five minutes of fame has had more than 675,000 views and William has since been invited to New York to appear on NBC's Today Show with weatherman Al Roker.

Guided and prompted by Johnson and dressed in a smart suit, William was a natural in front of the green screen - intently concentrating on pointing to the right places on the map.

William, a student at Robert Asp Elementary school in Moorhead, Minnesota, was
keen to say hello to his teacher and classmates and to point out the 
3.2 inches of snow predicted for his upcoming cub scout winter camp.

He declared that the temperature at the end of the next school day would be '29 degrees and breezy'.

At one point Johnson asks William if he sees any snow on the radar, to which he replied: 'It's just a normal map' before the camera panned away to reveal snow 'in the Great Lakes area from Chicago to Toronto'.

Sadly William's sunny disposition 
couldn't warm up the winter weather for Valley Live News viewers, as he 
delivered a forecast of snow, rain - 'the green stuff' - thunder and 
temperatures as low as 5F.

His confident performance in front of the camera led the station's anchor to say: 'Do we have his resume on hand? Because we really should.'

William's mother Sally Hallman said her son first became interested in the weather after hearing about a tornado warning in May 2011.

She told Infoforum: 'He's very smart. He likes to talk a lot. He's not shy.

'He loves learning.'

Ms Hallman said her son has a talent for maths, likes numbers, and enjoys watching the History Channel and National Geographic.

She also revealed he had been telephoned by production staff at The Ellen De Generes Show, but no appearance had been booked.

William's appearance on the station was 
thanks to a weekly slot during the news programme where schoolchildren 
aged 8-18 in the North Dakota area can apply to present the weather 
through Scheels stores in Fargo, Moorhead and Grand Forks.
