These  pictures show the moment a Ukrainian mother embraced her son after he was released by pro-Russian rebels.

The man was among at least three prisoners of war handed over to relatives without any conditions by rebels in the Luhansk People's Republic.

But a larger exchange of hundreds of prisoners between Ukrainian forces and the pro-Russians was embroiled in controversy, with reports suggesting the swap has been pushed back a day.

The rebels had been set to release 150 Ukrainian prisoners in exchange for Kiev handing over 222 captives, government and rebel officials confirmed.

Russian state television today showed Ukrainian prisoners of war boarding buses in the main rebel stronghold of Donetsk before being driven to a location north of the city where the exchange was set to take place.

But a news agency in Russia quoted an official in the eastern city, who said the exchange was pushed back to tomorrow.

The conflicting reports could not be independently confirmed.

Discussions leading up to the planned prisoner swap led up to scheduled peace talks between Russian and Ukraine in Minsk, Belarus, which have since been called off. 

Previous rounds of talks in September led to a cease-fire and an agreement to pull back heavy weapons, but fighting has continued between the two sides.

More than 4,700 lives have been lost in the fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces, volunteer battalions and pro-Russian separatists.  

Ukraine's parliament vote earlier this week to abandon the country's non-aligned status, a first step toward a possible bid for NATO membership.

Train and bus services to Crimea, annexed by Russia, were cancelled today, with transport officials citing security concerns.

Russia invaded the Black Sea peninsula in March following the ousting of Ukraine's former Moscow-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych after months of protests.
