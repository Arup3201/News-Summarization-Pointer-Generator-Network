At least 36 people have been killed in a bus crash in Veracruz, southern Mexico, local authorities report.

A passenger bus slammed into a broken-down truck and burst into flames shortly after midnight in the southeastern Mexican state.

The victims were local businessmen and women, reportedly shopkeepers, who were travelling from the Tabasco state capital of Villahermosa to Mexico City, the state civil defense agency said.

Both state and federal officials said that four people survived the crash, and have been taken to hospital.

The agency's emergency director, Ricardo Maza Limon, said that all victims appear to have burned to death inside the bus.

Pictures from the scene show the vehicle so badly charred that the tires have melted and the markings on its sides are unreadable.

The federal highway department, which earlier gave the death toll as 34, said the bus was on a highway in the area of Acayucan when it struck a tractor-trailer owned by a milk protein company that had broken down and was parked along the roadside.Â 

'The trailer-truck was on the shoulder of the highway at [135 kilometres] ... when the bus hit the back of the trailer, which caused this regrettable accident,' governor Javier Duarte told AFP.

Forensic nightmare: The bus reportedly burst into flames shortly after impact, around 1am on Sunday morning

Struggle: Investigators say the state of the burnt-out bus will make it difficult to identify the victims

'In addition to crashing, the bus caught fire, which makes the investigative work to identify bodies more difficult.'

Federal police concluded that the truck was badly parked, the state government said.

Via Twitter, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto sent a message of condolences to the families of those who died.

The tragedy was a dark start to the Palm Sunday, celebrated as the start of Easter in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.

Bus crashes and road accidents occur frequently in Mexico, taking a heavy death toll each year.

In 2012, at least 43 people died when a truck hit a bus in Veracruz, and just a couple of months later more than 30 others were killed in a separate accident in Guerrero state.
