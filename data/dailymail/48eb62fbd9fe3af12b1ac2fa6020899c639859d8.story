Ed Balls has admitted he has been caught speeding.

The Shadow Chancellor and leadership hopeful opted to attend a speed awareness course on Tuesday rather than take penalty points on his licence.

Mr Balls said he was ‘bang to rights’ when caught going 56mph in a 50mph zone on a motorway in his West Yorkshire constituency.

Traffic trouble: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls admitted he had been caught speeding in his own constituency, and went on a speeding course to avoid penalty points

He blamed roadworks for his misdemeanour, as temporary speed restrictions were in force.

Mr Balls has form when it comes to 
motoring offences – in April 2010, he was caught on his mobile phone 
while driving between his constituency and London.

At the time, he was fined £60 and was meant to have received three penalty points on his licence.

However, yesterday the Shadow 
Chancellor said he had decided to take the safety driving course because
‘I currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it 
that way’.

Let the train take the strain: The speeding revelation is embarrassing for Ed Miliband's Labour party, which has sought to exploit George Osborne's parking faux pas for political gain

Writing on his blog, Mr Balls appeared to blame long-running roadworks for his error.

He said: ‘Like many local people, I was caught out by the never-ending roadworks on the M62. Pulling on to the motorway at Morley I realised too late that the speed restrictions were still in place.

‘I was caught and bang to rights – doing 56 in a 50 mile restriction zone. Going too far, too fast, you might say.

‘I paid my fine and chose to attend a speed awareness course. I currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it that way. Which is why, this week, I ended up in the Holiday Inn with 39 others.’

Her claimed the course – which allows drivers to escape penalty points by undergoing training the dangers of speeding was ‘very professional and actually really worthwhile’.

The driver of George  Osborne's car reversed into the disabled parking space outside Magor services on the Eastbound side of the M4

Mr Balls went on: ‘What hit home were the statistics which link speed to car deaths. At 20 mph, less than 10 per cent of people will lose their lives if hit by a car. But the probability rises exponentially, going above 40 per cent at 40mph.

‘Our course instructors explained that casualty rates have fallen over the past decade, as drivers have become more aware and car design has improved. The worrying thing is that this trend has started to reverse in recent years.’

He went on to claim that his own misdemeanor reinforced his call for more 20mph routes in near schools and residential areas in Morley in his constituency.
