In a lot of countries across Europe, the holding midfielder is the position for artists, those who effortlessly set the tone and tempo of a game.

Andrea Pirlo, for one, has made the role an art form. Sergio Busquets does it majestically for Barcelona and Spain, while Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger are others who have flourished in the role of being their team’s orchestrator, getting everyone to play at their rhythm.

In England, however, the holding midfielder has been more about breaking up play and protecting the defence. Go back through the years and you’ll see the national team has lacked a figure who has been happy to sit in and get the team moving forward.

We produce those who go box to box — think Bryan Robson, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard — or scufflers like Nobby Stiles in 1966. They produce scrappers in Europe, too, such as Didier Deschamps and Claude Makelele, while Javier Mascherano does that role today, but we have never had anyone in that class.

When I played for England’s Under 21s, I was a holding midfielder but my task was hunting down the opposition’s No 10. By contrast, the opposition’s main man was always holding and I’ll never forget facing Argentina’s Juan Roman Riquelme at the 1997 Under 20 World Cup in Malaysia.

Riquelme was so good he always had space to do what he wanted. It was as if he was making time stand still, plotting where he would ping his next pass.

That is what a high-class holding midfielder can do but, for whatever reason, England haven’t produced that kind of player in modern times. Could that be about to change? Roy Hodgson sprang a surprise by selecting Jack Wilshere at the base of his diamond in Switzerland. The move split opinion.

How did you feel he played? Personally, I thought he did OK, but it might be that he needs to get used to it in order to find his niche for club and country as the position we expect him to fill is not there at the moment.

Wilshere emerged as someone who likes to burst past players and get forward but, during the time he has been out injured, Aaron Ramsey has made the attacking midfield role his own at Arsenal, with lots of goals and dynamic performances.

If England are going to retain a diamond, you wouldn’t look to use Wilshere in the roles Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph fulfilled in Basle, as I don’t think he has their dynamism or energy. Equally, I don’t think he’d be comfortable playing with his back to goal, like the impressive Raheem Sterling.

But dropping deeper? It could work. One of Wilshere’s qualities, aside from his skill, is his aggression. I remembered that from when I watched him stand out during Arsenal’s FA Youth Cup final win over Liverpool in 2009 and it was evident when I first played against him.

Jack was only 18 when he lined up against us on the opening day of the 2010-11 season but, aside from being comfortable in possession, he was fearless, driving into challenges whenever the ball was there to be won. Trust me, he knows how to tackle.

He has that in his armoury but Wilshere, to maximise his opportunities, might have to learn the finer details of being a holding midfielder.

He would have to be more disciplined and stop running with the ball, for instance, as that would invite danger. Those short, sharp bursts have been a trademark for Wilshere but they probably haven’t helped with some of the injuries he has sustained.

Think about it: if you keep running with the ball, you become more susceptible to being hit by heavy challenges.

The point is England do not have many to choose from in that role. Michael Carrick could play it but enough England managers have looked at him and not been convinced; Gareth Barry continues to do well for Everton but his time appears to have gone.

Other options would be Phil Jones, if a man-marking job needed to be done on a world-class No 10, or perhaps Tom Huddlestone, but the concern would be why Tottenham sold him if he was truly international class. So it may be that Wilshere has to learn the role and it can be done.

Pirlo started as a No 10 but Carlo Ancelotti experimented by bringing him back at AC Milan. Schweinsteiger was converted from being a winger by Louis van Gaal, while Paul Scholes dropped back to control games for Manchester United.

You wouldn’t say any of those players, or some mentioned earlier, were outstanding defensively.

Maybe what happened to Wilshere in Switzerland was for the best, as I don’t believe he is a player you would yet describe, for all his ability, as being one of your first names on the teamsheet, either for Arsenal or England.

To excel in the role, he would have to improve his range of passing but it is encouraging to hear he is watching videos, working out what he needs to do to fulfil the expectations many have for him.

Time will tell whether he would be suited to playing in that role in the hurly-burly of the Barclays Premier League, particularly in a contest like Saturday's against Manchester City, and maybe he would be more suited to it at international level. 

Raheem Sterling has thrived in an advanced, central role for Liverpool and now for England

Some would argue that he isn’t suited to the position, that he should be used further forward, but others have more powerful claims to operate in those roles at this time. Who knows? In the future we might talk of Jack Wilshere as England’s conductor-in-chief.

Rodgers will relish return of famous Anfield nights 

Playing at Anfield on a Champions League night is one of the best experiences in football and my old ground will be full on Tuesday.

It is great that Liverpool are back in that competition and nobody will be looking forward to the meeting with Bulgarian side Ludogorets more than Brendan Rodgers, who has been working relentlessly to get his team back on this stage.

Starting this evening, though, is a period when a lot of questions will be asked of Rodgers and his squad and they will be scrutinised to see how they cope with the challenge of keeping the team near the top of the table and competitive in Europe. 

He has some injuries to contend with but that will not stop Liverpool supporters thinking that they are going to win the next three games — Saturday’s match against Aston Villa and a trip to West Ham sandwich the Ludogorets fixture — over the next seven days.

There is no doubt Brendan will have to rotate and it will be crucial that he makes the right decisions at the right times. This schedule shows why Liverpool made so many signings during the summer but fitting them all into the right blend will determine if they can continue to be successful.

What I'm looking forward to this week...

Seeing how Louis van Gaal manages to make it all work.

I have been reading a book by Dutch journalist Maarten Meijer on Van Gaal and one line sticks in my mind.

Van Gaal says that he does not ‘pick the 11 best’ when selecting his team but he ‘picks the best 11’ and it will be intriguing to see how he moulds everything together for Manchester United.

After an extraordinary end to the summer window, when they smashed the British transfer record with their £60million purchase of Angel Di Maria and then signed Radamel Falcao on loan, Van Gaal has a squad to start making progress.

Falcao, for instance, is a brilliant addition to the Barclays Premier League and if he recaptures the form he showed for Atletico Madrid — his performance against Chelsea in the 2012 European Super Cup is still in my mind — he will transform United.

But if 50 people sat down and tried to pick a team for the game against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, I’d say there would be countless formations and few would have the same names.

Angel di Maria, who joined in a British record £60m fee from Real Madrid, made his debut against Burnley

If Van Gaal is going to make things tick for United, he is going to have to make some high-profile and tough decisions with his team selection. The biggest one of all is how will he possibly get Falcao, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in the same team?

Should he continue to live by his rule of not picking ‘the 11 best’, there are going to be some disappointed stars in United’s dressing room.

How Van Gaal handles that will be key.
