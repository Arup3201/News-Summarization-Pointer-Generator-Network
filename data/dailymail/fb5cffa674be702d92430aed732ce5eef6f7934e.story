We're more accustomed to seeing her modelling Chanel and Marc Jacobs, but up-and-coming model Kendall Jenner is still happy to lend her good looks to charity.

Kendall, who is part of the Kardashian clan, has pulled on her BBC Children in Need T-shirt designed by her good pal, designer Giles Deacon, all in the name of charity.

The star looks fresh-faced and a far cry from the glamorous supermodel we are used to seeing on the runway.

A plethora of British celebrities have joined in too, including music legends Kylie Minogue, Paloma Faith and Tinie Tempah, British model Jodie Kidd, and Louise Redknapp.
