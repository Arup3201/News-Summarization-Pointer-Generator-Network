A California pastor accused of causing the death of a 55-year-old man last year has had a murder charge against him dropped.

Rob Lynn Cox was charged with murder several months after an altercation with Link Ellingson in the parking lot of a Las Vegas bar in June last year.

At one point, Ellingson fell backwards and hit his head on the ground, causing brain injuries that left him hospitalized for six months before he died from a hemorrhage.

Victim: Link Ellingson hit his head on the ground during an altercation last June. The 55-year-old died after spending six months in hospital

Cox was arrested in the California church he works at with his father-in-law after a coroner ruled that Ellingson's death had been a homicide.

The charge was dropped by a judge yesterday after prosecutors announced that they planned to bring the case before a grand jury.

The judge also ordered that the $100,000 bail for the pastor be returned.

'We’re simply not proceeding with the criminal complaint,' prosecutor Robert Daskas told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The grand jury, whose proceedings are 
carried out in private, will have to determine whether Cox should be 
indicted in the death.

Family and friends had gathered outside the court yesterday to show support for Cox, who could be disqualified from adopting children with his wife, Julie, because of the legal case.

At the time of the altercation, Cox had been visiting Las Vegas with some church interns for missionary work.

They had stopped at the Four Kegs pub for dinner, before continuing their journey to Texas.

According to witness Kelli Lane, Ellingson approached Cox and the interns and said: 'Hey girlfriend, you want to f*** with me?' 

She said: 'Rob was immediately like, "Oh my gosh, no," backed up, "I 
have kids here".'

Another witness, who was part of the church group, claimed that as Ellingson approached Cox grabbed him around the waist and they both fell to the ground.

Ellingson's widow, Marie, has refuted claims that her husband of 29 years would have acted in the way witnesses described.

Some of the things he was accused of saying 'are not even in his vocabulary,' she told Associated Press.

'Unfortunately, [the case has] been making me very sad. I'm a Christian myself. It's discouraging to see a Christian church and to see these 
horrible things [they're saying,' she said.

Mrs Ellingson kept a six-month vigil at her husband's bedside after the incident, and said she had to endure seeing her once-gregarious husband overcome brain surgery, and suffer strokes and coma before he finally died just before Christmas.

For a short time it appeared that Ellingson was recovering. Facebook posts to update friends and family of his condition, shared excitement when he managed to sit up or start speaking again.

Mrs Ellingson said members of her church group, Canyon Ridge Christian Church, had been helping her through her grief.

'I
 just really wish that the truth comes out, and that things are taken 
care of fairly and that Link is looked at in a good light. God is a judge, not me.'

For Cox, who claimed he was acting in self-defense and had immediately reported the incident to the police, he must now wait for the grand jury's decision.
