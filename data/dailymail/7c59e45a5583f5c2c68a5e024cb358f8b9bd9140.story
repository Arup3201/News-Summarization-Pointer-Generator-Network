Felicity Bassouls is charged with persistently emailing and phoning her son-in-law Ben Cohen

The mother-in-law of Rugby World Cup winner Ben Cohen is to stand trial accused of harassing the Strictly Come Dancing star.

Felicity Bassouls is accused of persistently emailing and phoning the former England player between September and October last year.

Bassouls, 67, turned up for a hearing of the case at Northampton Magistrates' Court today, but had not been called on to attend.

A three-day trial was set down to start at Corby Magistrates' Court on August 12, with the agreement of defence lawyers and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Bassouls, of Ardross, near Alness in Highland, Scotland, is also accused of harassing her own son, Austen Blaney, with emails and phone calls, between September 1 and October 29.

She was unconditionally bailed after the hearing.

Asked if she had any comment to make outside court, Bassouls said: 'I have nothing to say at this time.'

Cohen split with his wife Abby  but denied that it was due to a relationship with his Strictly Come Dancing on-screen partner Kristina Rihanoff.

The BBC show is said to have a 'curse' with its steamy routines believed to have a hand in ending celebrities' relationships.

At the time of the split, Cohen said: 'It is a sad world when two adults cannot have a friendship.' 

The athlete and activist, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup winning squad, had been married to Abby for 11 years and the couple have twin daughters.

Cohen met his wife in 1995, at the age of 17, and the couple married in 2003 before having their daughters in 2008.
