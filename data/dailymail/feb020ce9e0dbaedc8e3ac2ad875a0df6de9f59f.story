A damning report has revealed the Department for Transport was biased against Sir Richard Branson's bid to continue running the West Coast mainline

The Transport Department was biased against Sir Richard Branson’s bid to continue running the West Coast mainline, a damning interim report into the fiasco reveals today.

The independent investigation into the scandal highlights ‘significant errors’, ‘weak governance’, and a ‘flawed process’ in which ‘bidders were treated inconsistently’.

The contract to run the West Coast mainline franchise for 13 years was originally awarded to First Group over Virgin.

However, a legal challenge by Sir Richard cited significant flaws in the process forced the Government to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding.

The findings vindicate charges by Virgin and others revealed in the Daily Mail that there was an in-built bias against the Virgin bid which has been characterised as ‘ABB’, or ‘Anyone But Branson’.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin last night accepted the damning findings of widespread ‘flaws’ in the way the rival bids by loser Virgin and winner First Group were handled by his department.

But while conceding they made ‘uncomfortable reading’, he insisted there was nothing in the report to blame ministers - putting the onus firmly on his civil servants.

However, Labour’s spokesman on transport Maria Eagle named Mr McLoughlin, his predecessor Justine Greening, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond who also headed the Transport Department, and former transport minister Theresa Villiers, as serving Cabinet ministers with their ‘fingerprints’ on the fiasco.

She said: ‘This isn’t just a faulty process, it’s a faulty Government.’

Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw, who headed the independent investigation into the scandal cites a number of ‘contributory factors’ which added to the 
franchise fiasco – including ‘lack of clarity’, lack of leadership, 
lack of continuity in senior leadership roles, and officials being in 
too much of a hurry without sufficient planning or preparation.

These follow
cut backs in the department which have left staff ‘stretched’ when also 
dealing with other major projects.

The right to continue to run the West Coast mainline franchise from this winter was originally awarded to First Group – until a legal challenge by Sir Richard forced the Government earlier this month to abandon the decision and re-run the bidding after identifying serious flaws in the process.

The highly critical Laidlaw report blames:

Mr Laidlaw said: 'My strong initial 
view is that a number of factors operating together, caused or at least 
contributed to the flaws.'

'There is a body of evidence that strongly suggests that the DfT’s 
evaluation of the financial robustness of bids in the Inter City West 
Coast (ICWC) franchise process was developed late, in a hurry and 
without proper planning and preparation.'

Organisational changes within the department ‘resulted in a lack of 
clarity’.

’Key members of the franchise team were relatively junior and 
inexperienced in comparison with the bidder representatives they were 
facing.’

Labour shadow Miss Eagle said: 'Ministers must not be allowed to shuffle
off responsibility - not my words but the words of the Prime Minister. 
This isn't just a faulty process, it's a faulty Government.'

'Not one but four members of the 
Prime Minister's Cabinet and it's about time they took responsibility 
for it instead of blaming officials.'

Sir Richard Branson said Whitehall 
had accepted that First Group’s successful £7billion bid for the 15-year
franchise was ‘five times riskier’ than Virgin’s by demanding a 
£200million guarantee – compared to just £40million demanded of Virgin.

But if the Department had properly followed its rules, the Government should have demanded a £600million security, he said.

Mr McLoughlin told MPs: ’To be blunt, 
these initial findings make uncomfortable reading. But they they provide
a necessary and welcome further step to sorting this out.’

He said: 'It is clear that the 
Inquiry has identified a number of issues which confirm that my decision
to cancel the franchise competition was necessary.

‘These include the lack of 
transparency in the bidding process; the fact that published guidance 
was not complied with when bids were being processed; inconsistencies in
the treatment of bidders; and confirmation of technical flaws in the 
model used to calculate the amount of  risk capital bidders were asked 
to provide to guard against the risk of default.’

But he also told MPs:'It’s an interim report. Nowhere does it criticise ministers.’

A further report, with firm conclusions, is expected by the end of November.

Labour’s Miss Eagle urged Prime 
Minister David Cameron to make sure his ministers take responsibility 
for the cancellation of the bidding process for the new franchise, which
collapsed several weeks ago shortly before FirstGroup signed a contract
for the deal.

Mr McLoughlin was updating MPs on an 
interim report into the affair, which is set to cost taxpayers at least 
£40 million in refunding costs to the bidding firms, Virgin Rail and 
First Group.

But Miss Eagle said experts said the 
full cost of re-working all the affected franchises would be in excess 
of £100million and demanded to know how much.

She said: 'Do you agree ministers must 
take responsibility for serious or systematic performance failures, 
flawed policy and poor design?

'Ministers must not be allowed to 
shuffle off responsibility - not my words but the words of the Prime 
Minister. This isn't just a faulty process, it's a faulty Government.'

In August, the DfT announced that 
transport giant FirstGroup, rather than Sir Richard Branson's rail 
company Virgin Trains, had won the battle to operate a new 13-year West 
Coast franchise.

Sir Richard, whose company had run
West Coast since 1997, dubbed the bidding process ‘insane’ and launched
a legal challenge to the decision.

Former transport secretary Justine 
Greening, who presided over the original FirstGroup decision, and her 
successor, Mr McLoughlin, both defended the bidding process.

But it was while preparing to 
defend the Branson court challenge that mistakes in managing the West 
Coast bidding process were found.

Mr McLoughlin scrapped the bidding and
suspended bidding on other franchises. In addition, three DfT civil 
servants were suspended.

Mr McLoughlin also announced that two 
independent inquiries would be carried out - the first to look 
specifically at the West Coast bidding process and the other to 
investigate franchise bidding generally.

FirstGroup had been due to take over 
the London to Scotland West Coast route on December 9. Virgin has been 
asked to carry on for the time being, with a two-year interim franchise 
to be offered later followed by a longer, permanent franchise.

In addition to Virgin and FirstGroup, two other companies had bid to run West Coast.

FirstGroup which was stripped of 
the franchise when the flaws welcomed confirmation that it was ‘in no 
way at fault’, having acted entirely in accordance with the DfT's 
process throughout but added: 'Nevertheless we are extremely disappointed
and dissatisfied that, as a result of Government's reversal of its 
decision, taxpayers and West Coast passengers will not benefit from the 
better deal that our strong bid would have delivered.’

Derogatory emails about Sir Richard 
Branson’s Virgin Trains were allegedly sent between civil servants.

The messages were between a dozen 
staff at the Department for Transport, which has been accused of 
allowing the development of a culture characterised as ‘ABB – Anyone But
Branson’.

The Government awarded the new 
£7billion franchise to FirstGroup, but cancelled it before the planned 
handover in December after Sir Richard’s Virgin group, which offered 
£700million less, made a successful legal challenge on the grounds that 
the Government ‘got its sums wrong’.

An insider revealed: ‘There is 
electronic e-mail traffic between the officials. In some of them Virgin 
is referred to in derogatory terms. Some people sent these messages, 
others received them.’

Virgin executives had long been 
concerned about the perception of an ‘anti-Virgin’ bias and culture 
within the department characterised as ‘Anyone But Branson’.

Industry insiders said Whitehall 
officials – some of whom had worked for more traditional train operators
– disliked the firm’s maverick approach.

There was allegedly deep 
resentment when Virgin renegotiated the terms of the West Coast 
franchise in 2006 on terms which ‘nailed them to the floor’.

‘Some people in the department felt they were stitched up,’ said one source. ‘It’s a catalogue of calamities.’

Three civil servants have been suspended by the Departmernt as a result of the fiasco.

But one of them, Kate Mingay, the 
department's commercial and technical services director, issued a 
statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her 
role in the West Coast process had been ‘inaccurately portrayed mainly 
due to statements and other comment made by the Department for Transport
itself’.

She added: ‘I would like to make it 
clear that I did not have lead responsibility for this project and that 
neither I nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the 
economic modelling for this project, or for any DfT project.

‘Nor did I have any responsibility for
the financial modelling in respect of this project and I have not been 
involved in briefing DfT ministers or other Government ministers in 
respect of this project.’
