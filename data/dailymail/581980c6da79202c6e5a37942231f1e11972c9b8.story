A world-record holding motorcyclist died on Sunday trying to top 300mph on a test track in Maine.

Bill Warner, 44, died after he lost control of his bike and slid off the track, according to reports. The accident happened at the annual Maine Event, held at the former Loring Air Force Base.

Warner, of Wimauma, Florida, died at a local hospital an hour after the accident occurred, a spokesperson said.

The daredevil was alert and talking with emergency responders shortly after his accident, according to the Bangor Daily News.

A spokesperson for Cary Medical Center in Caribou later confirmed Warner had succumbed to his injuries, the paper reported.

Conflicting reports peg the speed Warner was travelling at between 260 and 285mph when he lost control of his modified turbocharged Suzuki Hayabusa, sliding around 1000ft.

‘He got maybe 4,000 feet or so, and where I was standing at the starting line, you could see a big dust cloud and then it got silent,’ spectator Cole Theriault told the paper.

Warner, who sells tropical fish while not rocketing through time trials, previously achieved a speed of 311mph over 1.5 miles on the same track in 2011 - considered to be the land speed record for a conventional motorcycle.

Rules posted on the Loring Timing Association website tell riders to veer to the left to slow down, veer to the right if there is a problem. Warner veered to the right, according to eyewitness accounts.

‘The bike, from what I heard, was demolished, just in pieces,’ Theriault said. ‘After a minute, all you could hear was the sirens.’

Calling the bike ‘significantly damaged,’ Limestone Police Chief Stacey Mahan declined to provide more details and said authorities were investigating.

Shortly after setting the record in 2011, Warner spoke of his unmatched achievements.

‘The big part of it, after the speed happens, is trying to stop the bike,’ he told the Bangor Daily News.

‘Here at Loring Air Force Base, there is a mile shutdown to slow the vehicles down and I used every bit of it.

'The bike was bouncing, hopping, skipping and sliding. Needless to say, I got it stopped safely. It was a little scary.’

Prior to Sunday’s crash, Warner set a record of 296mph in only one mile. The track itself is just more than 2.5 miles.

Event officials cancelled the rest of the Sunday’s events after the deadly accident.
