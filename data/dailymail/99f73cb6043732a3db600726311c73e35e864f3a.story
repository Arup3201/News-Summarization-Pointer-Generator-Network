Manuel Pellegrini savoured Manchester City’s Barclays Premier League title triumph, then vowed to start building on the club’s success immediately.

A 2-0 win at home to West Ham saw City finish two points clear of Liverpool as they completed a league and Capital One Cup double, but Pellegrini admitted the club’s ambitions were larger.

‘Big teams cannot be satisfied with just one title,’ said the City manager. ‘It is very important to celebrate today and tomorrow, and start on Tuesday working for next season. Then we will start thinking where we can improve.

Rebuild: But the Chilean vowed to build on the success and come back stronger next season

‘It was a beautiful, great season and in the future we will try to continue winning.

I manage a great group of players and a great institution. We were the best team in the Premier League.’ City will mark their second title in three years with an open-top bus parade through Manchester city centre this evening before catching a flight to Abu Dhabi to celebrate with the club’s owners.

They hired Pellegrini last summer to bring harmony after the rancour of Roberto Mancini’s final season in charge, and the Chilean admitted he had inherited an unhappy dressing room.

‘Maybe the relations were not the best,’ he said. ‘It was very important to have calm, to try to convince them how we can play and how important it was to be close, all of us. Maybe they were in a very difficult moment when I arrived here but they always believed what I told them.’

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose slip-up against Chelsea two weeks ago proved crucial in the title outcome, couldn’t hide his pain at missing out on a first Premier League triumph.

‘I’m devastated,’ he said, after Brendan Rodgers’ team had come from behind to beat Newcastle 2-1 at Anfield and finish second on 84 points. ‘I can’t sugar-coat this. I’m gutted for the fans but we can’t be too down. It was a fantastic season. We need to bounce back and go one better.

‘It’s taken me until I’m 33 to have a proper title race so the experience for these young lads in the squad is going to be vital. There is a lot of ability and we can keep improving.

Rodgers said: ‘My over- riding feeling is pride we have finished the season winning 12 out of 14. The players have shown an incredible consistency and quality. We would prefer to finish top but we’ve finished just behind City. It wasn’t because of the past few games. It’s over 38 games.’

Pellegrini becomes the first coach from outside Europe to win the Premier League title. His team set a record of 156 goals in all competitions, even though they fell one short of Chelsea’s best of 103 Premier League goals. ‘If I am the first one (non-European) to win it, that is a reason to be proud but I don’t think I’m the most important person,’ he said.

‘Maybe if we didn’t win the title it would be a very good reason to say it was my first season, but I did not want to give an excuse. We won with 102 goals, with the record of goals in all competitions and it is the way the team must play with our quality.’

City players celebrated by throwing Pellegrini in the air after lifting the trophy.

Captain Vincent Kompany, who claimed City’s second goal after Samir Nasri had calmly opened the scoring, said: ‘Forget about the money and everything. As a kid, you dream of lifting trophies, and I’m living that dream.

‘Next year we need to be even better. If you want to be a big club this must be one of so many.’

In contrast, West Ham boss Sam Allardyce contemplated an uncertain future. ‘It’s not a very secure industry to be in but it’s one we all love,’ said Allardyce. 

‘We are established in the Premier League for the second season on the trot, exactly where I was asked to get us.’
