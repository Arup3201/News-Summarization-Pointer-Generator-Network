An attorney for a German couple who lost their bid for U.S. asylum in order to home-school their seven children says deportation proceedings against the family have been called off after the family was granted a special 'indefinite deferred status' by the Department of Homeland Security.

The news comes only a day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Uwe Romeike's asylum appeal.

The family had initially been awarded asylum in the U.S. after they were threatened with incarceration and losing their children for their decision to home school. The decision to grant the family asylum was challenged by the Obama administration - a challenge the administration won.

'Indefinite deferred status': The Romeike family will be allowed to stay in the U.S. indefinitely thanks to a ruling from the Department of Homeland Security

Michael Donnelly, an attorney with the Home School Legal Defense Association, said the group received a call from the DHS on Tuesday morning.

'This is a great, great victory,' he said. 'We're all very grateful and pleased.'

Romeike had claimed in court that his family faced persecution in Germany, where almost all children are required to attend state-approved schools. Those include some private Christian schools.

The German government allows a few exceptions to the compulsory attendance law for parents who face logistical hurdles, for instance if they have to travel constantly for work. But children whose parents keep them home because of ideological objections to the state-approved schools are treated as truants.

The Romeikes moved from Bissingen an der Teck, in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, to Morristown, Tenn., in 2008 after pulling their children out of school and facing an escalating series of confrontations with German officials that led to fines totaling 7,000 euros, or more than $9,000. They said they feared that if they continued to home-school in Germany they could be sent to jail or lose custody of their children.

They initially were granted asylum by a Memphis immigration judge, but that decision was overturned on appeal when challenged by the Obama administration.

As it worked its way through the courts, the family's case won the support of many in the Christian home-school community, and an online petition asking President Barack Obama to grant asylum for the family was signed by more than 127,000 people.

Donnelly said on Tuesday that Romeike was declining interview requests, but he did issue a statement. It said the family — which includes Romeike, his wife and their seven children ages 1-17 — is 'happy' to have indefinite status, even if that means they won't get American citizenship any time soon.

'As long as we can live at peace here we are happy,' Romeike states. 'We have always been ready to go wherever the Lord would lead us.'

Donnelly said the deferred status is revocable, but he doesn't expect it to be revoked as long as the family stays out of trouble.

Donnelly said the news from Homeland Security was unexpected. The Romeikes' attorneys had been planning to ask friendly members of Congress to introduce a special bill allowing the family to stay.

The Home School Legal Defense Association still is pursuing legislation that would recognize people who come to the U.S. to home-school their children with some sort of refugee or asylum status, Donnelly said. He said there are a handful of other German home-school families seeking asylum in the U.S.

'We don't know how the government will handle their cases,' he said. 'They are still in the early stages.'

The case has garnered a lot of media attention. According to HSLDA, the Fox News website recorded more than one million views in 24 hours for the story about the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case, which is the most page views the site has ever received for a single story in a 24-hour period.

'This is an incredible victory that I can only credit to Almighty God. I
 also want to thank those who spoke up on this issue — including that 
long ago White House petition. We believe that the public outcry made a 
huge impact. What an amazing turnaround — in just 24 hours,' Michael 
Farris, chairman of the Home School Legal Defense Association told the Christian Post.

Romeike later said that the fight to stay in the U.S. was never about him.

'This has always been about our children. I wouldn't have minded staying
 in Germany if the mistreatment targeted only me — but our whole family 
was targeted when German authorities would not tolerate our decision to 
teach our children — that is what brought us here,' Romeike said.
