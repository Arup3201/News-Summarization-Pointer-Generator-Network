A wildfire that has already consumed more than 200 square miles is raging out of control in California's Yosemite National Park, threatening homes, hotels and campgrounds and cutting power supplies. 

The scale of the massive blaze, which has tripled in size to 128,000 acres  since yesterday to more than three times the size of San Francisco, has been captured in an incredible image by NASA.

Meanwhile, Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for the city of San Francisco 150 miles away because of the threat to the city's utilities, with two of three hydroelectric power stations shut down.

The governor had already declared an 
emergency for the area around the fire but extended it to 
San Francisco last night, saying the blaze posed a threat to the city's power lines
and stations in the fire area.

The city gets 85 percent of its water from the Yosemite-area Hetch Hetchy reservoir and that has yet to be affected.

The Rim Fire, named after the popular 
lookout point, is burning on rugged terrain making it harder for crews, totaling more than 1300 firefighters, to reach the blaze which is only two per cent contained.

'The terrain is so difficult that you
can't go into direct attack,' U.S. Forest Service spokesman Trevor 
Augustino said, adding that reinforcements are due to arrive on Friday.

The
Rim Fire is the fourth-largest and fastest growing wildfire in the 
nation, National Interagency Fire Center spokesman Robyn Broyles said.

The
fire is among the top firefighting priorities in the U.S, according to 
the National Interagency Fire Center. Currently there are 50 large 
wildfires in the West.

On
Wednesday, the fire had been five per cent contained and ranged across 
16,000 acres, but it has grown dramatically and the containment 
level fell.

Despite using 
aircraft to try to contain the fire for five days, it was still raging 
out of control with 100ft flames, according to CBS Sacramento.

Two
evacuation centers have been set up for residents, who have been urged 
to leave their homes if they suffer health conditions that could be 
affected by the thick smoke in the air. 

So far
the fire, which is mainly centered in the Stanislaus National Forest, 
has destroyed two homes and seven outbuildings since Saturday.

However, it is starting to spread to private land and is about five miles from the northwest outer edge of the national park.

The blaze is threat to about 4,500 homes and businesses in the popular vacation spot.

The private summer community of Pine Mountain Lake, which has a population of 2,800, has been voluntarily evactuated, along with several other campgrounds.

Yosemite, which spans 750,000 acres, attract nearly four million visitors last year, according to the park website.

Park officials were forced to stop 
traffic on Highway 120, one of four access routes to the park, on 
Tuesday because of the fire.

'This is typically a very busy time for us until Labor Day, so it's definitely affecting business not having the traffic come through to Yosemite,' Britney Sorsdahl, manager at the Iron Door Saloon and Grill in Groveland, five miles from the fire, said.

Christina Wilkinson, who lives in Pine Mountain Lake near Groveland, said: 'Usually during summer, it's swamped with tourists, you can't find parking downtown. Now, the streets are empty. All we see is firefighters, emergency personnel and fire trucks.'

Tourist cabins on a Groveland ranch directly in the fire's path have been evacuated and a couple of buildings on the site burned down.

'This fire, it's killing our financial picture. This is our high season and it has gone to nothing, we're really hurting,' Corinna Loh, who owns the Spinning Wheel Ranch and Iron Door Saloon, told the Modesto Bee.

She added that most of her employees had left the small town of about 600 people.

At an emergency meeting in Tuolumne County supervisors voted to ask Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency and free funds for the firefight.

There are no immediate plans to close the park, Yosemite ranger Scott Gediman said, adding that the sky above the park had been clear of smoke on Thursday.

The cause of the Rim Fire is under investigation.

The U.S Forest Service, the leading wildfire-fighting agency, is running out of money to deal with the large number of fires this year.

It has spend $967 million so far this year and was down to just $50 million - enough to cover just a few days of fighting blazes - before it was forced to divert $600 million in funds from other areas too boost its reserve.
