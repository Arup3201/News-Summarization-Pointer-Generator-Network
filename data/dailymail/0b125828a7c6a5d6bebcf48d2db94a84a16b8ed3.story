Baroness Thatcher died peacefully while sitting up in bed at the world-famous Ritz and reading a book, it emerged last night.

The 87-year-old former prime minister suffered a stroke at 11.28am on Monday while reading in a top suite at the five-star Ritz Hotel in central London, where she had been staying since Christmas.

Her body was removed from the hotel, where suites cost up to £3,660 a night, by private ambulance almost 13 hours later at 12.20am yesterday, and her funeral was scheduled for next Wednesday.

Her twins Mark and Carol were abroad 
at the time of her death. The body was driven away with three 
undertakers in the front and escorted by four diplomatic protection 
officers on motorbikes.

A 
BMW 4x4 followed with two men in the front and blacked-out windows 
behind. Security was heightened with more than a dozen police officers 
surrounding the hotel as the vehicle pulled away.

 the wrought iron gates at the rear of the hotel, which had been closely
 guarded since news of her death broke.

In the late period of her life she 
had the occasional lunch at the Ritz, where staff always knew to serve 
chicken consomme and a main course of lemon sole.

She was also sighted on a park bench in London enjoying the sunshine in March last year with her carer Kate. Gone were her high heels, replaced by comfortable sandals and a walking stick.

Then, at Christmas, she went to hospital for minor surgery to remove a growth from her bladder. When she came out she was very uncertain on her feet, and a return home was out of the question.

So she moved quietly into a suite at the Ritz – one of her favourite places – and she was invited by its owners the Barclay brothers to stay there for the foreseeable future. She never left.

Her two carers took it in turns to stay with her and the same group of friends who took it in turns to see her at her Belgravia home were put on a rota at the Ritz.

Preparations
 for the ceremonial funeral - due to take place at St Paul’s Cathedral 
in central London with full military honours - were underway as MPs 
began planning tributes to her in Parliament.

Meanwhile, the Queen and the Duke of 
Edinburgh will also attend the service at St Paul's Cathedral - the 
first political funeral Britain's monarch has attended personally since 
Winston Churchill's in 1965.

Lady
 Thatcher's family was expected to gather in London yesterday, with her 
son Mark due to fly in from Spain last night and his twin Carol also now 
believed to be in the country.

MPs
 are being recalled from Easter recess today to let them pay tribute 
to her. The House of Lords has also been recalled and will sit at 2.30pm
 - the same time as the Commons.

But
 as tributes poured in for our first and only woman prime minister, many
 on the Left condemned the social impacts of her policies encouraging 
the free market and stripping power from unions.

On Monday night, hundreds of people held 
parties to ‘celebrate’ her death in Glasgow and Brixton, south London. 
But today the Government will put down a motion expected to pay 
tribute to her.

Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to give a statement to the Commons, followed by Labour leader Ed Miliband. There will also be time for backbench MPs to make their own tributes to her.

As Lady Thatcher’s health deteriorated, the issue of whether she should be granted a state funeral - as Churchill was - grew increasingly controversial.

However, it has emerged that she rejected the idea herself, and also insisted she did not want her body to lie in state or money to be spent on a fly-past.

Instead, the streets will be cleared for a procession from Westminster to St Paul’s, where there will be a televised service attended by dignitaries from around the world.
