A in Maryland that has just appeared on the market has been making waves due to its unusual subterranean design.

At first glance, the residence at 8305 Poplar Hill Drive in the town of Clinton – population 26,000 - looks like any other stately two-story colonial-style home, complete with a red-brick facade and elegant white columns propping up a loggia.

Topography: The 3,300-square-foot home sits on 1.3 acres of land

But take a few steps to the side, and the true nature of the house is revealed: it's been built partially underground.

The Clinton house has all the bells and whistles of any above-ground dwelling, plus it is eco-friendly.

The home’s underground design provides a natural insulation, thanks to which its owners will be paying on average only $150 a month in utility bills, according to the real estate listing.

The house, conjured up by Formworks Buildings, an architecture firm that specializes in earth-sheltered 'green' homes, measures 3,300 square feet and sits on 1.3 acres of land.

Spacious: The house features three bedrooms and two fool bathrooms 

Sustainable design: The house was designed by Formworks Buildings, an architecture firm that specializes in earth-sheltered 'green' homes

Major savings:The home's future owners will be paying on average only $150 a month in utility bills

Inviting: The rooms in the house are painted a pleasant off-white hue, and thanks to an abundance of windows there is plenty of light

Convenient: The property comes with an above-ground detached two-car garage 

The home is the brainchild of architect Dale Percy, who has described it as his perfect project, according to MyFox DC.

Despite its quirky look, the residence has all the conveniences of modern living: three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a detached two-car garage, a fireplace and a gourmet kitchen with a separate dining room.

According to the team at Keller Williams Select Realtors, which is handling the sale of the property, doomsday preppers will especially appreciate the home’s underground structure.

Money talks: Constructed in 2006, the Clinton home is currently being sold for $425,000

‘So what is it about this home that makes it so fantastic? Well, aside from the obvious fact that it’s probably your best chance to stay safe should we ever see a zombie apocalypse, just imagine how jealous friends and family would be when they find out you’ve just purchased the coolest home in Maryland!,’ the listing jokingly states.
