A beauty queen known as the real Penelope Pitstop is shaking up the high-octane world of drag racing with her bright pink super-charged drag car.

Piston head Jayne Kay, 18, from Bury, Greater Manchester, competed to be Miss England but now hopes to become the only woman in Britain to hit 330mph on four wheels.

And while most teenagers are lucky to get a normal driving licence and buy a modest-engined small car, Jayne can drive a 2000 horse-power dragster, capable of 0-100mph in a staggering 1.09secs - consistently hitting 200 mph.

Determined: The 18-year-old has been racing for years and hopes to be the only woman in Britain to compete at the top level - where dragsters hit at least 300 mph

Miss Kay's pride and joy is her own bright-pink 200mph race car, aptly called Pink Lady, adding a touch of glamour to what is primarily a male-dominated sport.

'My dad Gary was a car champion in 1993, the 
year I was born. He then took me down to the track to watch when I was 
three or four and I was hooked,' she told MailOnline.

When asked if she is the real-life 
Penelope Pitstop, she said: 'I suppose. My pink car stands out and it 
means that people know it is a girl driving.

'It also makes a strong statement that women can drive just as well as men.

'I absolutely disagree that being a 
beauty contestant and a drag racer don't match. Nobody should be judged 
just by their looks and I have proved myself in the sport. Drag racing is 
aggressive but I have shown I can still do it my own way.'

But as if piloting a 200mph car was not enough for her, she decided to enter the Miss England competition in 2011 after securing sponsorship from Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire.

Coming a respectable fifth in the semi-finals, Jayne was the only entrant to take to the catwalk in her fire retardant boots.

'I was scouted in Manchester, competing against nurses and other professionals and I came in fifth. I'm very proud of representing my sport there because most had never heard of it because it is male dominated.

'In my racing class there are two other women and in the top class, where they go 300 mph, there are none. That is where I want to be next.'
