Australian scientists claim to have found a crystal clear lake that has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years.

‘It's like God's bathtub,’ Dr Cameron Barr said about the area named Blue Lake. ‘It is beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful.’

The lake, which is one of the largest on
North Stradbroke Island off the south Queensland coast, is so pure that
you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom.

Blue Lake, which is one of the largest on North Stradbroke Island off the south Queensland coast, is so pure that you can see to 10 metres below the surface to its bottom. Scientists say it has been untouched by climate change for over 7,500 years

Researchers studied the lake's water 
discharge, water quality and comparisons of historical photos over the 
past 117 years, as well as fossil pollen and algae to better understand 
its history.

The discovery was made as researchers were studying former lakes in the same area that have dried up over the past 40 years.

'We didn't realise just how unique and unusual this lake is until we started looking at a wide range of environmental markers,' said Barr.

'We know that there have been variations in climate in the region 
including North Stradbroke Island over recent decades, but during that 
time the depth, shoreline and water chemistry of Blue Lake has displayed
little variation.

'We also know that the region experienced a significant shift towards a 
drier climate around 4,000 years ago. Again, Blue Lake has demonstrated 
little variation over this period. This is in stark contrast to other 
changes in the region due to shifts in climate.

Blue Lake is in North Stradbroke Island, 18 miles off the coast of Brisbane. Its lakes are classed as one of the world's most ecologically important wetlands

According to Barr, Blue Lake has remained unchanged because its waters drain into a nearby swamp and are replaced by an aquifer. 

‘It appears that Blue Lake has been an important climate "refuge" for the freshwater biota of the region, and is in the same condition now as it was 7500 years ago.

'With appropriate management, the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds, possibly thousands of years to come,’ added Barr.

Project leader  Dr John Tibby, said the results of this research could affect decision making about utilising the freshwater aquifer of North Stradbroke Island as a source of fresh water for the mainland.

The results have been published online in the 
journal Freshwater Biology.

North Stradbroke Island lies 18 miles off the coast of Brisbane - and its lakes are classed as one of the world’s most ecologically important wetlands.

As well as Blue Lake, the waterways include Brown Lake, the Keyholes, Eighteen Mile Swamp and some small lagoons.

The Aboriginal name for Blue Lake National Park is 'Kaboora', which means 'silent pool'.

A haven for wildlife, the area attracts forest birds, goannas (a type of monitor lizard) and other reptiles. Blue Lake is also home to soft-spined sunfish.

The lake is not accessible by car, and the nearest car park is 1.5 miles away.
