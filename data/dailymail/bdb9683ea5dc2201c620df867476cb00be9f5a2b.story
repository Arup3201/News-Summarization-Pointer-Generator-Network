Nearly a quarter of British holidaymakers are willing to travel from a remote airport for cheaper flights and endure one or two connections, a survey of 9,000 Brits has revealed.

And a third of travellers would be willing to sacrifice refreshments for an entire flight if it meant securing a cheaper fare.

However, despite this, Ryanair - which specialises in cheap fares to out-of-town destinations without any on board frills - has been voted the worst airline in the UK.

Out of favour: Holidaymakers rank other airlines higher than Ryanair for value for money

When asked to name their favourite, holidaymakers voted for British Airways which topped the poll with nearly a quarter of the vote (23 per cent), followed by Virgin Atlantic in second place, according to the annual TripAdvisor study.

At the other end of the scale, Ryanair was named Brits’ least favourite airline, with nearly half of all votes polled (49 per cent) – compared to just two per cent naming it their favourite airline.

The age of austerity seems to be having an impact on business travel too, with 72 per cent of business travellers having flown on a no-frills airline in the last 12 months.

In fact, British business travellers are now less likely to fly exclusively with a full service airline (28 per cent) than British leisure travellers (32 per cent).

The annual air travel survey by TripAdvisor also revealed that when it comes to finding the cheapest airfare, the travel agent is no longer the go-to source for most British travellers.

Best overall: British Airways has been named the UK's favourite airline in a poll

Fewer than one five say they find the lowest prices using the traditional route, compared to over a third who say they can find the cheapest fares on price comparison sites.

Almost a third of Brits cite their previous experience of flying with an airline as one of the three most important factors when choosing flights.

The survey also revealed that over half of British travellers have experienced flight delays in the last 12 months and, of those, one in six (15 per cent) suffered delays lasting for more than six hours.

Yet despite the high number experiencing delays, only one in ten (10 per cent) chose to claim compensation. However, the good news for travellers is that, for those who did make a claim following a delay, two-thirds said they received compensation successfully.

In-flight meals: A third of passengers would be happy to ditch food on planes in favour of cheaper fares

Katherine Clark, regional business development director for TripAdvisor Flights, said: ‘Flights can make up a significant part of a trip in terms of both cost and experience,  the results of this year’s survey show that price continues to be a concern, with a significant portion of British travellers willing to forgo some comfort for savings.’

The survey also revealed those inflight amenities that British travellers could not do without.

Over three-quarters (76 per cent) said that legroom is most important to them, compared to just six per cent naming inflight entertainment options and three per cent naming meal options as most important.

The least favoured inflight amenity was duty free shopping, with less than one per cent of the vote.
