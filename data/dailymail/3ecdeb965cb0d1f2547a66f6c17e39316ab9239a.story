Nestled in the buzzing streets of west London, Knightsbridge has long been considered a playground for the rich and famous.

And every summer Arab playboys speed around its polished streets in garish super cars worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. 

But one Russian woman has given the young men a run for their money - by parking her crystal-encrusted Mercedes outside an exclusive hotel for  the world to see.

Dazzling: The unique Swarovski-crystal encrusted Mercedes was parked outside The Levin Hotel in Knightsbridge, west London, this afternoon 

With every last inch of the already luxurious car covered in crystals, the vehicle attracted the attention of onlookers who are used to the garish cars of Arab playboys 

Privileged: The 21-year-old student said she wanted something 'unique' and is glad so many people admire her car - but worry some drivers might crash if they look at it for too long. Miss Darionova, a business studies student in London, said she when she is ready to sell the car she will give the money to charity

At £55,000  many would consider the Mercedes CLS 350 an extravagance in itself. 

But Daria Radionova made her 2014 model even more luxurious, by covering it entirely in Swarovski crystals. 

'I wanted to have something unique and do something special,' the 21-year-old business student said. 

'The people who did it came over from Russia and worked for 12 hours a day for two months on the car.

'I am really happy with it and I am looking forward to driving it around.

'It has only just been finished and everywhere I go people stop to have a look at it.

'It gets lots of attention from people walking by and in cars. Sometimes I think they might crash.

'Everyone is taking pictures of it. When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.'

Onlookers stopped to admire the vehicle which usually costs around £55,000. It is not known how much Miss Radionova spent on her bespoke treatment

Blingtastic: No detail has been spared in the custom-job which is thought to have cost experts two months to complete. The car attracted attention in London this afternoon

The Mercedes CLS 350 is usually the trademark of company executives and luxury taxi services but has been given a blingtastic makeover by Miss Radionova 

Sparkling: Even the car's door handles have been included in the transformation which Russian-born Miss Radionova shared on her Instagram page 

Just in case: A small plastic bag of spare crystals rests on the passenger seat in case any of the one million crystals on its exterior falls off 

The dazzling car attracted more attention than any other that staff at The Levin Hotel had seen before including some of the more garish models driven by men 

As night fell the vehicle twinkled and sparkled as Miss Radionova drove home. The luxury jacket trader gave it the aptly named registration plate 'baiibyy'

The Mercedes CLS 350 is covered in one million individual
Swarovski crystals.

Each was painstakingly applied by hand by a group of workers
who flew over from Russia especially for the project.

They worked for 12 hours a day for two months straight to
attach the diamonds, worth £20,000, to the car.

Every single part of the vehicle has been covered in the crystals, from
the bumper to the rear, right down to the door handles and wing mirrors.

The 2011 Mercedes model, which is a diesel and is owned by
21-year-old Russian Daria Radionova, is now said to be worth much more than its
average £55,000 asking price.

Daria, who 
shares her privileged adventures on Instagram, uploaded a photograph of 
the finished product to the photo and video sharing website accompanied 
with the hashtags: '#crystal 'crystalcar #knightsbridge #harrods and im 
not an #arab guy (sic)'. 

Parking outside the Levin Hotel on Basil Street near Harrods today, the car drew in crowds of admiring onlookers.

A manager said: 'We have seen a lot of unusual cars like Ferraris parked outside but I think this one has got the most attention. 

'If you have the cash why not do it? It looks good and fun.' 

Every summer supercars are flown to the area by their wealthy owners in their droves. 

The most outrageous car to make the trip over this time around is the six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, an enormous £370,000 off-roader. A 220mph Pagani Huayra, worth more than £1 million, has also attracted attention from tourists and passersby.

There is also a gold Range Rover, various Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, numerous Bugatti Veyrons and a 1970s Datsun. 

The rich Arabs stay in the best hotels and empty their wallets in London's most expensive shops, but they also cause problems with their unique supercars.

Residents in affluent Knightsbridge have complained they are behaving in an anti-social manner, revving the cars and treating the exclusive area as their personal racetrack. 

The garish cars are usually the domain of wealthy Arabs. This Mercedes CLS - starting price £82,000 - was parked on Chelsea's Sloane Street in August

A Qatari-owned £200,000 Ferrari 458 in front of a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. The cars attracted gangs of camera-wielding youths, dubbed the 'Carparazzi' in Knightsbridge this summer 

This £50,000-plus Ferrari 456 Italia has been given a spider wrap by its Qatari owner, who was keen to show it off on the streets of central London last month 

A gold and black Saudi-owned Bugatti Veyron - which can sell for up to £1million - was parked in a street in Kensington in August causing many to stop and take photos

This heavily-modified gold Range Rover - estimated to be worth more than £150,000 - has attracted attention after its owner parked it outside the Wellesley hotel

A Bugatti Veyron Centenaire - one of the most expensive cars to be made in the world -d rives past admiring onlookers outside The Levin where Miss Radionova's car was spotted
