Staff at one of Marco Pierre White's gastropubs have allegedly staged a walkout in protest over the chef's 'bossy management style'. 

A group of 'frustrated' employees at the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire, are said to have resigned in quick succession, apparently forcing the venue to turn customers away.

But the manager has denied the claims and says they are telling guests to go elsewhere because the venue is undergoing refurbishment.  

Walkout: A group of employees at the Pear Tree Inn, Whitley, Wiltshire, are said to have left the restaurant in quick succession in protest at Marco Pierre White's (right) 'bossy management style'

The famous chef bought the pub in 2011, but locals quickly became 'upset' with the changes he made, and some shunned it for being too pricey.

Customers who have booked rooms are apprently being sent to a nearby hotel and tables can’t be reserve - but a spokesman for the venue claimed the restaurant is only shut for a quick refurbishment.

Local councillor Terry Chivers, who has been drinking at the pub for more than 20 years, said around 15 members of staff walked out in the past few weeks.

He said: 'It has been a down hill struggle since he [Marco] took over to be honest. He has gone through about eight or nine chefs in the last year.

'It is because they are not allowed to run the how they think it should be run. But the final straw came two or three weeks ago and most of the staff resigned en masse, basically because he wouldn’t let them manage. They just got frustrated.

'I understand the chef that was there left yesterday. He took most of the staff with him. I walked up there today and I said to the manager ‘what the hell is going on?’

'He’s a great guy but he’s there by himself. He said ‘well, I put my notice in and I’m leaving in two weeks time’. There is nobody there to run the place.

'When I was up there there was a Spanish couple there. He was there trying to explain "we can’t take you because we’ve got no staff".'

A member of the kitchen staff who left the pub two years ago, but worked under ‘Pierre White’s reign’ said there have always been problems.

He told Mail Online: ‘By the end of my time there, it was a horrible place to work.

‘It was always up and down. When he first turned up it was really good, but after the novelty wore off it just dropped. The standards weren’t great.

‘The head chef that was brought in and was having to train someone new every week because of the turnover of staff. It just didn’t go well at all.'

He explained that 16 and 17-year-olds would be talked down to while they worked and, by the end, some of them ‘just couldn’t take it’.

White bought The Pear tree in March 2011 with business partner Paul Clark as one of six pubs from The Maypole Group which went into administration.

He was slammed for removing all draught lagers from the bar and stocked just one bottled lager costing £4.20 a bottle.

Cider drinkers had to make do with a super strong 7.3 per cent drink, but the menu had more than 40 red wines, with the top bottle costing £139.

Allegations: The venue - which was bought by the chef in 2011 - has allegedly been forced to turn away customers as 'only one manager remains' - but staff claim it is just because of refurbishments

Reaction: Residents in the Wiltshire village 'shunned' Marco Pierre White's 'posh' food when he took the venue over in 2011

All pub snacks were removed with customers being pointed towards the 'posh' menu for food, and one of the eight rooms at the hotel cost between £70 and £170 a night.

Customers who have booked rooms at the venue are being sent to one of White’s other hotels - the Rudloe Arms in Corsham, Wiltshire.

Mr Chivers added: 'Marco doesn’t realise what’s going on. He lives in a bit of a dream world. And he won’t let the staff manage.

'The staff know what the locals want but Marco won’t let them. I’ve heard the place is losing £2,000 a week - that’s just the rumours though.'

But manager Duncan de Jager denied the place had lost its staff, defended his boss, and said customers were only being turned away because of a refurbishment.

He also said some younger members of staff had left to go to university.

Mr de Jager said: 'I’ve got a lot of respect for Marco, so it’s not my place to really say anything. I am leaving but I’m going on to my own career, I just want to take on something by myself - that’s the only reason behind me doing it.

Response: The manager has denied the claims - and says they have a 'full brigade' working at the restaurant and said the head chef had moved on because he was offered another job 

Interior: The venue in Whitley, Wiltshire, has a bar, restaurant and eight en-suite rooms 

'I’ve been working for Marco for coming on five years, which is a long time at one place, and I want to take on my own thing.'

He denied the staff has resigned en masse, or that he was the only staff member left, and added: 'We’ve at full brigade here.

'Yes the head chef has moved on, but that has been happening for some time really, we’ve been expecting it for a while.

'He is a very talented chef and he got offered a job in a restaurant where he can write his own menu.'

He said around ten members of staff remained and when asked about people being turned away to the Rudloe Arms, he said: 'We’re doing a refurbishment at the moment. We are refurbishing the kitchen and some of the rooms.'

Marco Pierre White has been contacted for comment.  

'Shunned': Rainbow Inn, Cooksbridge, East Sussex 

When Marco Pierre White opened the Pear Tree Inn in 2011, locals were said to have been upset.

Now staff have allegedly walked out because of the management style. However the chef's restaurants have been at the centre of controversy before.

In 2012 those living near The Rainbow Inn in Cooksbridge near Lewes, East Sussex, did not eat at the pub after the restaurateur took over because they believed it was too posh.

Customers reportedly rejected his new menu after he replaced traditional dishes like bangers and mash with delicacies including poussin a la chipolatas and pomme fondant.

Earlier this year, health inspectors allegedly found raw and cooked meat mixed together, filthy surfaces and poorly trained staff when they visited his flagship restaurant in Birmingham.

The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill in The Cube was given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers earlier this year.

It was revealed that inspectors found examples of cross-contamination at the premises including raw and cooked food being stored together and the same equipment being used for both.

The management were, as a result, ordered to carry out a thorough clean of the surfaces and equipment at the restaurant and train staff on food hygiene and hazard assessment.

In 2010, the Yew Tree Inn in Highclere, Berkshire, a pub he co-owned with proprietor Andrew Parton, was fined £30,000 for polluting a stream with sewage.

Neighbours complained after the Yew Tree Inn released the waste into a nearby stream. A court heard that the pollution amounted to a 'serious and continuing' environmental problem.

The restaurant pleaded guilty to five counts of polluting a water course between November 27, 2007 and January 15, 2009. Parton also pleaded guilty to five similar charges during the same period.
