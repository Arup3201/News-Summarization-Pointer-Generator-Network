Her performance in crime thriller Broadchurch helped the show become a hit.

But it seems the programme’s makers think Olivia Colman’s understated charm would be lost on American viewers.

The Bafta-winning actress was snubbed for the US remake in favour of an attractive blonde star, she has revealed.

Scottish actor David Tennant will reprise his role as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy – renamed Emmett Carver in the American version.

But Miss Colman’s character, Detective Ellie Miller, will be played by Anna Gunn, 45, who won an Emmy for her part as Skyler White, the wife of a drug dealing chemistry teacher, in American show Breaking Bad.

When asked last week why she had been dropped from the cast, Miss Colman, 39, said: ‘I don’t know. I never got the call.’

But she has previously admitted failing to live up to the American ideal of beauty.

She said: ‘I don’t fit in there 
really. Don’t get me wrong, if Hollywood calls, I’m going, but I can 
also see why they haven’t called.

Broadcasters are hiring only young, attractive women as on-screen sports presenters while sidelining older anchors, MPs claimed yesterday.

The BBC, Sky Sports News, Channel 4 and BT Sport were accused of casting aside anyone over 30 in favour of prettier, more youthful faces.

Channel bosses were also told they were guilty of ‘nauseating political correctness’ for claiming they were using female presenters to raise interest in sport among girls and women.

Labour MP Jim Sheridan said male presenters tended to be older, fat and bald, while women were young and attractive, ‘with one or two exceptions’.

‘There’s a feeling out there that if you’re over 30 in the sports pundit game then you’re finished,’ he said as TV chiefs were questioned by the Culture, Media and Sports committee.

But BBC director of sport Barbara Slater said: ‘We want a diverse mix of presenters, and we want them there on merit.’

‘I
 eat a bit too much, my teeth aren’t perfect, I’ve got eye bags. I look 
like a normal 39-year-old woman – but in England no one minds that.’

In contrast Miss Gunn is no stranger to pressures placed on US actors to look glamorous, recently revealing how she accidentally gained weight while filming Breaking Bad.

She said: ‘I was actually ill while I was filming and it affected my weight. They gave me cortisone and I puffed up and gained weight. Now I’m better, thank God. I run around after two kids. And I do Pilates.’

The remake – to be called Gracepoint – will start filming in January and screen towards the end of next year on US channel Fox.

With Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall in place as executive producer, the series will follow the same plot, with the same dramatic denouement that gripped 8.3million British viewers in April.

Miss Colman will reprise her role when the ITV drama returns to British screens for a second series next year.

Earlier this year, Will Mellor, who played psychic phone engineer Steve Connolly, hinted that the next series could be a prequel.

He said: ‘I can’t see it being about another murder because it will be a bit too coincidental.

‘It might go back to the old case that David Tennant’s character didn’t finish. Whatever it’ll be, it’ll be fantastic.’
