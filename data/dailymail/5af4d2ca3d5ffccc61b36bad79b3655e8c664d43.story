Lucky: This is six-month-old Sam Stevens who was rescued after his buggy was swept into the sea by a freak gust of wind

A baby who was blown into the sea in his buggy is expected to make a full recovery, his father said yesterday.

Sam Stevens, aged six months, was in the icy water for ten minutes after a gust of wind caught the buggy.

He is thought to have spent several of those minutes face down in the freezing water before a heroic harbour master dived in to save him.

George Reeder, 63, managed to turn the floating buggy upright and drag it against the harbour wall.

Onlookers then pulled the child to safety before he was taken to hospital.

He is said to be making amazing progress despite the length of time he spent in the water.

Yesterday the baby’s father spoke of the ‘pure euphoria’ of finding his son had survived – and thanked all involved in the rescue.

Martyn Stevens, 35, was at home while his partner Kate Cooper, 34, took their son and dogs for a walk around the nearby marina at Watchet in Somerset.

A gust of wind swept the buggy off the sea wall and Sam, strapped in his seat, fell face-down into 12ft of water.

Miss Cooper’s screams of ‘My baby! My baby has gone in the water,’ were heard by Mr Reeder.

He said: ‘When I got there the mum was
screaming and I saw the buggy floating.

'The tide was going out and the 
current was strong. It was slowly floating away, being swept out to 
sea.’

Dismissing suggestions he had behaved 
heroically, Mr  Reeder, who has worked at the marina for 11 years, 
added: ‘I didn’t have time to think. I just jumped in. I can’t believe 
the baby survived.’

Ten minutes seems an incredibly long time for such a young child to be in the freezing sea and survive.

One theory is that an air pocket formed between the water and the back of the floating buggy, allowing Sam to continue to breathe.

It is also thought that the bodies of young children are especially efficient at going into shock.

A baby’s smaller body slows down the metabolism more quickly than an adult’s and therefore protects the vital organs from being starved of oxygen.

In fact, many hospitals deliberately cool new born babies who have been starved of oxygen during birth.

One of the young family’s neighbours, 
Tanya Allen, 43, then performed CPR on Sam until emergency crews arrived
and an air ambulance flew him to Musgrove Park Hospital, in Taunton.

Mr
Stevens recalled the moment on Sunday morning when he was at home and 
heard sirens from the marina.

He said: ‘I looked up the road to see 
what the noise was and saw my friend Ben who looked absolutely 
distraught and just shouted at me “It’s your baby, it’s your baby”.’

Mr Stevens ran down to the marina where he saw his son being tended to on the ground.

He said: ‘I can’t stress how amazing George was, and Tanya as well.’

Mr Stevens added that Sam had astounded doctors with his recovery and he was expected home in the next few days.

‘All the doctors and nurses said he is doing fantastic,’ he said. ‘They have all been brilliant.

‘I’m feeling overwhelmed. It’s pure euphoria.’

Rain and high winds will continue to batter the UK this week.

Forecasters said there would be no 
let-up in the storms from the Atlantic until Sunday at the earliest, 
though temperatures will be unseasonably high.

Devon, Somerset and south-east Wales 
are likely to face a threat of floods as rain falls on ground saturated 
by snowmelt.

Warnings were also issued to areas in the Midlands, Wales, 
East Anglia and the North East.

Experienced kayaker Matthew 
Baird-Parker, 36, died on Sunday after he became stuck in a swollen 
river in the Yorkshire Dales.

A man died in Camden, North London, in the
high winds when he was struck by a sign falling from a bookies’ shop.
