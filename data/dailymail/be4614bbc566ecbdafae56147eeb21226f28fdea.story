Hull will pay up to £2.3m for Tom Ince, who signed for the club on a two-year deal in July.

The England Under 21 international, was a free agent at the end of last season and subsequently signed a two-year deal with Hull, after his contract with the Tangerines expired.

Ince is under 24 so Hull had to agree a compensation package with Blackpool to complete the signing of the 22-year-old on a permanent basis. They have now done so, without the need of a tribunal.

Blackpool will receive up to £2.3m cmpensation for Ince because he was only 22 when he left for nothing

Ince has recently been on loan at Nottingham Forest for two months after finding opportunities difficult to come by in the Premier League.

Steve Bruce said: ‘I think it’s a fair price. There has been a lot of hype about Tom and rightly so with what he did during his time at Blackpool. But, he’s only a young lad and he still has time to develop his game.

‘He has to be given time to find his way in the Premier League because there aren’t too many 22-year-olds playing regularly in the top-flight.

‘We’ve got to let Tom develop here. He’s done particularly well for us so far, we’re pleased with his progress but we still think there is more to come from him.’

The former Liverpool youth prospect scored 33 times in 113 appearances for Blackpool and was named the Football League Young Player of the Year in 2013.
