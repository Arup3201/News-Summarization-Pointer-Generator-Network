There are few things to make someone feel worse than being caught out after lying to a loved one.

For one man in Manchester, that feeling seems to have got too much, leading him to take desperate measures to apologise to his girlfriend.

These pictures show the mystery man standing on a city centre junction in Manchester wearing a sandwich board bearing the words, 'I'm so sorry I lied'.

'I'm so sorry I lied': The mystery man appeared outside an office block near Manchester city centre on Thursday evening and waited there for more than an hour

A woman, presumably the man's girlfriend, appears and, after chatting for half an hour, they walk off together to a nearby flat

The man, wearing only shorts and a t-shirt despite it being a chilly October evening, stood there for more than an hour sporting the humiliating hand-painted sign.

Eventually a woman appeared, presumably the man's girlfriend, and she spoke to him for around half an hour more.

They both then walked off together to a nearby block of flats and appeared to have got over whatever it was that had come between them.

Whether the man, who appeared to be in his mid-30s, was standing there for a dare, or whether the move was his idea to win her back or prompted by her is unknown.

Gareth Thatcher, 33, spotted the man near Manchester city centre from a nearby office window on Thursday evening and took the photographs.

He said: 'He was there for quite a while, I spotted him at about 8pm.

The man wore only shorts and a t-shirt as he waited for the woman to appear, but mystery remains over what he had done to warrant giving such a humiliating apology

'Then the girl came down. I don’t know if he knew she would be passing and was waiting for her or if he had been sent out there by her with the sign around his neck.'

Mr Thatcher, a director at a computer graphics firm, said: 'They talked for a long time out there on the junction.

'I assume he was off the hook by the end of it because they were all smiles as they walked off to one of the flats.

'I don’t have a clue what he did but it must have been pretty bad. I’ve never seen anything like it!'
