Among a tomb of gold pins, pearls and a rare bronze mirror dating back to the early Dark Ages, researchers have discovered a heavily deformed human skull. 

It is thought the tomb and skull found in the Alsace region of France have lain undiscovered for almost 1,650 years and may belong to an aristocrat. 

The forehead of the woman’s skull has been flattened, forcing the rear of the skull to narrow and become cone-shaped, and this artificial cranial deformation was a common practice in certain parts of the world at that time.

The cone-shaped skull was found in one of 18 tombs buried in Alsace. The tomb and skull is thought to be 1,650 years old when artificial cranial deformation was a common practice. Flattening the skull deliberately and forcing the rear of the head into almost a point was seen as a sign of wealth and status

Artificial cranial deformation, also 
known as 'head flattening' or 'head binding', is a deliberate method of 
deforming a person's skull.

The skull could be flattened, elongated, rounded or moulded into a cone-like shape.

The process usually began around a month after birth and continued for six 
months, although it can also be practiced for years until the desired 
shape was achieved. 

Practitioners used boards or thin strips of bandage to achieve the desired effect.

Skull deformation was
 a practice made popular by the Huns and spread to Europe during
 the time of the Roman Empire. It was particularly popular in Germany. 

Early
 examples of cranial deformation were found to date back to 45,000 B.C 
and were even found in the skulls of neanderthals in southwest Asia.

It still occurs today in a few places, like Vanuatu - an island in the south Pacific Ocean. 

Lead archaeologist Phillip Lefranc believes the graves were reserved for soldiers and their families from Asia who fought for the Roman Army.

Other treasures found in the aristocrat’s tomb were chatelaines - decorative belt hooks and chains worn at the waist - and a stag antler comb.

The mirror, as well as the chains, are thought to have originated in the Caucasis region of Asia and the tomb was one of 18 found buried in the Obernai region of Alsace. 

‘The deformation of the skull with the help of bandages and small boards is a practice coming from central Asia,’ Lefranc told LiveScience.

In a second burial site found in the same region, Lefranc and his team additionally found a necropolis containing 38 tombs. The skeletons were all positioned with their heads turned to the west, pictured, and among the skeletons were a collection of stone vases and jewellery

Having deformed skulls meant that people could be instantly recognised as being from a certain social class.

Each of these tombs were said to be well preserved because they were buried within limestone rock.
