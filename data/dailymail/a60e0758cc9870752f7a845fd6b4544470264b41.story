Luxury liner Queen Mary 2 is powering home to Britain for her 10th anniversary celebrations after being delayed by a huge snow storm in New York.

Almost two feet of snow was dumped on the cruise ship - named by the Queen in January 2004 - in the 18 hours she was docked in Brooklyn.

Her departure was put back by several hours to give the 2,600 passengers time to make it to the port in treacherous conditions.

Race against time: Luxury liner Queen Mary 2 (pictured previously in warmer climes) is powering back to Britain for its 10th anniversary celebrations on Friday after being delayed by America's polar vortex

Many faced delayed connecting flights as the United States struggled to cope with a 'polar vortex' that brought in temperatures as low as -53C.

The QM2 is now battling storm-force winds and huge waves mid-Atlantic as she aims to make it back to Southampton for Friday.

On her arrival she will be joined by fellow Cunard cruise ship Queen Elizabeth for a firework party.

Michael Gallagher, from cruise line Cunard, described the choppy Atlantic conditions as 'playful'.

Battling the elements: The QM2's departure was put back by several hours to give the 2,600 passengers time to make it to the port in treacherous conditions

He added: 'We delayed the ship's departure from New York to give passengers time to travel to the port.

'However, she is a fast Atlantic liner, built for speed and stability, and she is now powering across the Ocean back to Southampton.

'We are confident she will make it in time for the celebrations on Friday.'

He added: 'The ship was covered in snow in the hours she was alongside in New York. It created a wonderful Winter Wonderland for those coming on board.'
