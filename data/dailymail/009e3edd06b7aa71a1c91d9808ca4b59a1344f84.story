Hull City striker Nikica Jelavic is facing six weeks out following surgery on a long-standing knee problem.

Jelavic, 29, is Hull's top scorer with eight goals and is set to miss their games against Chelsea, Swansea, Southampton, Liverpool and Crystal Palace.

Hull are three points above the relegation zone with nine matches remaining.

The club initially wanted to manage Jelavic's knee through until the end of the season but after last weekend's goalless draw with Leicester it was decided the surgery should take place 'as soon as possible to prevent further damage and complications in the future'.

Elsewhere, the Hull City Supporters' Trust has once again called upon the club's owners to abandon plans to change the club name to Hull Tigers.

The FA Council rejected owner Assem Allam's attempt to rebrand last year but on Monday an arbitration tribunal ruled that that decision had been put aside.
