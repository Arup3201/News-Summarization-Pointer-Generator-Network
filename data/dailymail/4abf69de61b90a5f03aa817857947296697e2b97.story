But any ladies still dreaming they will one day run away with George Clooney are about to be disappointed – as it has been reported he is finally engaged.

So in love: Actor George Clooney with Amal Almuddin, 36, on safari in Africa

Clooney is understood to have proposed recently after the couple enjoyed a series of exotic holidays around the world during a seven-month romance.

His relationship with Miss Alamuddin, 36, is a departure from the long list of actresses and models he has dated in the past.

Rumours of their engagement have been circulating in the US media after she was spotted several times in the last week sporting a 'huge ring'.

US-based Entertainment Tonight reported that on Thursday, the lovers were spotted at celebrity restaurant Nobu in Malibu, California, with Clooney's friends Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber. At the dinner, Miss Alamuddin had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger, according to an onlooker.

The same ring was seen by another diner at another LA restaurant, Craig's, on Wednesday, when the pair were understood to be celebrating their engagement.

A friend told US magazine People: 'George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem.

Big news? George Clooney's girlfriend Amal Alamuddin, pictured here in October, was reportedly seen by multiple people showing off a ring at Nobu in Malibu, California, on Thursday.

'I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together for ever.'  

Clooney, 52, was first photographed with Miss Alamuddin last October in London.

In March, they went to Tanzania, where they were photographed on safari, and they also visited the Seychelles.

Earlier this year, a source who has worked with Clooney told People: 'He's with someone who is a very accomplished attorney. She isn't someone who is pursuing a career in acting or entertainment. She's on his level.'

History repeating? While known as a diehard bachelor, George has been married before briefly to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993, pictured here in 1990

Miss Alamuddin was once voted the 'hottest barrister in London' by a law blog, but her life could not be more removed from the celebrity world which Clooney inhabits.

She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire. Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger – a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by  all accounts.

Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut.

The family are believed to belong to the Druze religious sect, an offshoot of Islam. After leaving Oxford, where she gained a 2:1 in law, Miss Alamuddin studied at the New York University School of Law.

Now working out of London's Doughty Street Chambers, she specialises in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law.

Asked about the engagement news yesterday, her parents' housekeeper beamed a large smile and said: 'I don't know.'  But a neighbour said: 'I'm really happy for her – who wouldn't be happy with George Clooney as their husband?'  

Yesterday, Clooney's spokesman Stan Rosenfield did not deny the engagement rumours but just said: 'I do not comment on his personal life.'

Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993. Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type.

Last December he told Esquire: 'I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn't very good at it.'

His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.
