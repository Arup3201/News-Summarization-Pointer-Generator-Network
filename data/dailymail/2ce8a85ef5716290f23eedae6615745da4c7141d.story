As relatives wept, the body of an Alabama woman whose wish was to be buried in her front yard was removed Friday, after her devoted husband lost a lengthy court fight to keep her there.

James Davis, 74, said he promised his wife, Patsy, that he would bury her outside their two-story log home in the northeast part of the state.

After her death in April 2009, the Stevenson City Council rejected his request for a cemetery permit for his yard, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch anyway.

Missed: Davis, holding his wife's picture, said there has been 'so much hurt' from the court battle

The city sued and he eventually lost his legal battle. A judge this week approved a plan to remove the body.

One of Patsy Davis' daughters burst into tears as the vault containing her body was lifted out of the ground.

James Davis watched silently from a few feet away. Family members, the sheriff and a deputy also looked on.

Davis called the exhumation 'a travesty.' 'This never should have happened,' said Davis, 74. 'I broke no laws.'

Neighbor Phyllis Matthews stood by and watched the vault containing the casket being raised.

'I'm
sorry for the family, what they're going through,' Matthews said. 'I 
lost my mother back in April. I'd hate to think it was my mother they 
were digging up. But she's buried in a cemetery.'

James Davis, who had been married to his wife for 48 years, said he now plans to cremate her remains and keep them in the house.

Davis told Jackson County 
Circuit Judge Jenifer Holt during a hearing on Wednesday in Scottsboro, Alabama, that he would 
comply with an order she issued last year.

'I'm gonna take Mama up and have her cremated and keep the remains in the house,' he said.

He had previously vowed to never remove the remains of his wife after promising her before her death that he would bury her just yards from their front porch.

He maintained the city shouldn't be 
able to force him to remove the grave, which is marked with a headstone 
and decorated with plants and flowers, from his longtime residence in 
Stevenson.

But he 
conceded defeat earlier this week and said he would hire a contractor to
remove the body of his wife and then have it cremated.

Davis said the exhumation and an urn would cost $2,745, and the judge also ordered him to pay $678 for a legal transcript the city said it needed.

The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tennessee, and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival.

'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children.

In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in 2009.

The city sued to
make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from 
using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge 
last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery.

The
Alabama Supreme Court recently refused to intervene in the case, and 
Holt held the hearing to determine how the exhumation would occur and 
how the costs would be covered.

Outside court, Davis said he, his children and grandchildren were 'at ease' with the decision to remove the body and have it cremated.

'They can't hurt us anymore in this thing and there's been so much hurt, so much hurt,' he said.

City attorney Parker Edmiston said the 
town tried to work with Davis, offering him two plots in the town 
cemetery for Patsy and himself, but the man refused to cooperate.

'He said it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, and that's what he did,' Edmiston said.

Davis'
attorney, Tim Pittman, and Edmiston agreed that the body, casket and 
burial vault would be removed and the grave refilled immediately, but 
Davis said he would not move the stone tombstone that has marked the 
grave.

Edmiston said a city ordinance prohibits markers like the tombstone at homes, 'but that's an issue for another day.'

Davis said he had dropped a plan to declare his house a church so he could keep the grave as is.

Loyal: James Davis watches on. This never should have happened,' said Davis, 74. 'I broke no laws.'
