The 2014-15 NBA season started on Tuesday in dramatic style as defending champions San Antonio Spurs beat the Dallas Mavericks 101-100 in the Western Conference.

The Spurs, overriding favourites to defend their crown having won it in such a convincing manner last term, needed a late three-pointer from Tony Parker - who scored 23 points in total - to clinch victory. 

Before tip-off, San Antonio staff and players were presented with their championship rings. The inscription inside the ring was 'Good to Great', which was coach Gregg Popovich's mantra last season.

The Spurs were imperious throughout the regular season last time around, boasting a sensational win-loss record of 62-20. 

The franchise took this form into the play-offs which culminated in their 4-1 thrashing in the best-of-seven NBA Finals series against the Miami Heat.

In coach Gregg Popovich they have someone who understands when to utilise his squad and how to maximise their talents too.

Criticisms of Spurs in the past have been that they are an ageing side - but the experience of Parker, Tim Duncan, Parker and Manu Ginobli is brilliantly off-set by Kawhi Leonard.

The 23-year-old was the Finals' MVP last season and his qualities on both side of the floor will be a key component to a cohesive Spurs side.

Spurs' likely threats in the West are likely to come from the Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors.

The Houston Rockets - who travelled to the Staples Centre to face the LA Lakers on Tuesday - are likely to struggle following the departures of two starters in Jeremy Lin and Chandler Parsons.

Over in the East, the Conference is shaping up to be one of the most hotly-contested in years.

LeBron James' (right) move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers has made them strong contenders out in the East

All of the pre-season focus has been on LeBron James' move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat.

The four-time MVP won successive NBA titles with Miami, in 2012 and 2013, as he formed an unbelievable trio with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.

James' return to the Cavs immediately makes them a dangerous franchise to be reckoned with. In Kyrie Irving they have a star in the making alongside James, and the acquisition of Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves only makes them stronger.

However, the pressure on Cleveland to deliver so soon is a season premature considering they finished outside the play-off spots last year.

For the Heat, despite the loss of James coach Erik Spoelstra's can still rely on the talents of Bosh and Wade.

Miami have contested the last four NBA Finals series and the experience within their squad should see them come at least close to matching that feat again.

The additions of Danny Granger and Britain’s Luol Deng means success should continue to roll at the American Airlines Arena.

Arguably the team that both the Heat and Cleveland will be most wary of is the Chicago Bulls.

The Bulls finished fourth in the East last season but have been strongly tipped to go all the way in the Conference this campaign.

In centre Joakim Noah, they have the current defensive player of the year - and his tough-to-beat traits reflect that of coach Tom Thibodeau’s mindset.

The signing of Pau Gasol adds some much needed offense but it is the return of Derrick Rose from injury that has increased expectations at the United Center.

After suffering two serious knee injuries the 2011 MVP looks fit once more and ready to lead Chicago back to their Michael Jordan-inspired dominance in the 1990s.
