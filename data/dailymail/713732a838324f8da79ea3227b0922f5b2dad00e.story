The National Gallery of Australia will lift its 20-year ban on people taking selfies with art works from next year.

It is the Canberra gallery's attempt to catch up with times where social media is a major form of communication among friends and family.

Barely a month into his new role as director of the NGA, Gerard Vaughan tabled the topic at his first council meeting in November and had the restriction scrapped to the delight of the smartphone-welding public, The Australian reported.

The ban will be lifted come January 2015, bringing the NGA in line with many other galleries who have ditched the archaic practice.

Assistant director Simon Elliott told ABC News Online despite the latest exhibition, James Turrell: a retrospective, being exempt from the ban, there were plenty other art works that were allowed to be photographed - including a majority of its permanent installations.

He said this move not only meant people could document their time at the NGA for themselves and take home a souvenir, but it could also boost the gallery's profile.

'In 1982 when we opened you had to leave your camera in the cloak room,' Mr Elliott said.

The gallery's director Gerard Vaughan tabled the topic at his first council meeting in November. The 20-year ban was scrapped and will be officially lifted from January 2015

'These days we wouldn't dream of taking people's phones off them and we don't take their cameras.

'We hope that the younger audience who are a little bit more technologically sophisticated will take advantage of [social media]... and [share] their photos online.'

Restrictions on taking photographs remain in certain circumstances because artists opt to protect their copyright on art works by requesting no pictures are taken of their creations.

The NGA joins many other art galleries in Australia who have relaxed restrictions to allow more people to take away a selfie to remember their visit.
