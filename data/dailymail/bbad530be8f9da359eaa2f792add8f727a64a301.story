Earth Hour was launched in 2007 in Australia and has spread globally since

Last year nine million people in the UK took part, lighting candles in their homes as they switched off lights in their homes, as part of a record-breaking chain of 162 countries.

He said: 'Switching off the lights for Earth Hour is a statement of intent by everyone who takes part, making them part of a community which recognises that we really do have one planet and that we have it not just for ourselves but also for our children and grandchildren.

'It is a symbolic and powerful reminder that together we have the power to change things. It should also remind us that we do not have much time in which to make those changes. If everyone in the world consumed natural resources at the rate we do in the United Kingdom we would need three planets and not just one to support us.'

'The impacts - not least climate change, deforestation, overfishing, and the loss of numerous species for whom this planet should also be there - are already starting to affect us all.

'WWF works hard to address many of the environmental issues we face on our planet but Earth Hour is a chance for everyone to show that they care and are willing to do their bit to help because collective action has never been more vital. Last year over nine million people took part in Earth Hour in the UK.'

'They joined more than 1,000 businesses and organisations as well as the 4,600 schools which participated alongside some of the country's best known landmarks including Buckingham Palace, Edinburgh Castle, Tower Bridge, the Senedd, and Wembley Stadium.'
