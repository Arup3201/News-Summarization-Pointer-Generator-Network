Director Michael Bay is reportedly in the running to make a movie about the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. 

The man who brought the world The Transformers franchise, Armageddon and Bad Boys, is now in talks to direct 13 Hours - a big-screen adaptation from a book on the attack which killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. 

The film will tell the story of the six security team members who fought to protect the compound, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Director Michael Bay, the man behind The Transformers franchise, is allegedly in talks to make a movie about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012

The book has been adapted by Chuck Hogan, the writer behind books The Town, Prince Of Thieves and Devils In Exile. 

13 Hours was written by bestselling author Mitchell Zuckoff. 

According to Hollywood Reporter, 13 Hours will have a budget of no more than $40 million - a big change from the average $200million that it cost to make each Transformer movie.

Earlier this month Bay released new, explosive images from summer smash Transformers: Age of Extinction showing in great detail what went on behind the scenes of the blockbuster starring Mark Wahlberg.

Bay is also the 'star' of several images, as he appears in several shots looking right at home in his wild and fiery element. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Bay's representatives at William Morris Endeavor. 

It is not the first time that Bay will have taken on a major moment in U.S. military and political history.

The director was behind the 2001 epic Pearl Harbor starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale and Cuba Gooding Jr. 

It did well at the box office but less so with critics with the legendary Roger Ebert saying: 'There is no sense of history, strategy or context...'

The films that Bay has directed and produced have grossed $6.5 billion worldwide, according to his own website.

His other projects this year have included Transformers: Age of Extinction, The Purge: Anarchy, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija. 

On September 11, 2012, Islamic militants attacked the American consulate in the Libyan city, killing U.S. Ambassador  Stevens and three others. He was the first U.S. Ambassador killed on duty since 1979. 

The U.S. increased security at its embassies worldwide following the Benghazi attack as President Obama announced that 'no act of terror will go unpunished'. 

The U.S. has since captured those identified as being involved with the attacks and they are facing charges.
