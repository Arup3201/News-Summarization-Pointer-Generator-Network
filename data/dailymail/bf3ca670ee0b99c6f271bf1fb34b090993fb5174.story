Pay cut: Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, said the corporation's 
next director-general will be paid substantially less than the current boss

The BBC will ‘substantially’ cut the salary of its next  director-general, it was claimed last night.

Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, admitted that the broadcaster has already started a search for someone to fill its most senior role.

But he revealed the chosen candidate would be paid significantly less than the £671,000  given to current director-general Mark Thompson.

Although Mr Thompson, who has held the position since 2004, has not announced any plans to leave, there have been rumours he will step down after the London 2012 Olympics.

Lord Patten said an international head-hunting firm, Egon Zehnder, had already been appointed to produce a ‘succession plan’ by Easter.

He added: ‘It does not warrant the headline “Starting gun  fired for Mark Thompson succession”.

‘They are going to give us a report on what sort of people we should be looking for. They are not seeking a candidate.’

And he revealed that he believed Mr Thompson would  be able to stay in the role as long as he wished. Lord Patten spoke as he prepared to give evidence today to the Leveson inquiry into Press standards, along with Mr Thompson.

The former Conservative Party chairman said he did not agree with statutory regulation of newspapers.

Remuneration: Current director-general Mark Thompson earns £671,000. However he has not announced any plans to leave

He said: ‘It’s a more open, responsible and self-confident society that doesn’t give politicians any opportunity to prevent the accountability which goes with an interrogative, investigative press.’

And he was also quick to  defend journalists who did ‘things which flirted with the illicit’ if there was public interest in the story.

Lord Patten has often spoken of the need for reform at the BBC since he took over as chairman in June last year.

At the time, he said that he would take action over the ‘toxic’ issue of executives’ high wages and cut the number of senior managers from around 530 to about 200 by 2015.

He added: ‘Licence fee payers don’t expect the BBC to pay  sky-high commercial rewards to people that work for a public service.’
