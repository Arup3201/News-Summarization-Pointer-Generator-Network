A massive mountain wildfire that was visible from Las Vegas on Wednesday has destroyed residential and business properties as it nears Nevada's casino capital.

The first home - a ranch together with the main lodge and several outbuildings - has been destroyed by the blaze, while other commercial buildings had already fallen victim to the inferno.

No one was injured at the ranch, which is about five miles southeast of housing developments in Kyle Canyon, according to local media.

Glowing in the distance, the Nevada blaze ravaged for the 10th consecutive day. While now visible from Las Vegas, firefighters say they have mostly contained the flames

Quoted in the Las Vegas Sun, ranch owner Barry Becker, who offers the lodge to a group of friends and family for a getaway, said: 'We were hoping it would skirt north or go around us.It didn’t.'

The blaze, which was sparked by lightning striking dried woodland on July 1 and has so far destroyed 25,524 acres, lies around 25 miles east of the Sin City. On late Wednesday it was 15 per cent contained.

The U.S. Forest Service says on this side of the fire, it has burned into flatter terrain and 'fire managers are optimistic about containing this fire edge'. A public meeting will be held today to discuss further action.

The Mount Charleston forecast on Wednesday afternoon said today would see highs of nearly 28 degrees (82F) and westerly winds from seven to 13mph.

James Stone, public information officer for the National Incident Management Team, told Las Vegas Sun the somewhat cooler temperatures still made for tough conditions for firefighters, who have been tackling the fire in heat close to 40 degrees - or three-digit highs in Fahrenheit.

'The weather is continuing to be not good for firefighting,' Stone said.

Relative humidity is low on the mountain, adding to the extremely dry conditions. The National Weather Service on Wednesday afternoon issued a flash-flood watch warning for the Spring Mountains, throughout Thursday and Friday.

In the mountains they forecast a 50 per cent chance of rain; in the valley there was a 30 per cent probability.

But the possibility of rain also comes with a sting - the chance of further lightening strikes.

The Carpenter 1 blaze is one of 
scores of wildfires being watched and assessed by the Forest Service, 
across Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and other
states.

Hundreds have been evacuated from 
their homes as the deadly mountain wildfires continue to rage through 
parched woodland in northern and southern Nevada.

The 24-square-mile blaze near Vegas has forced more than 500 people out of homes in Mount Charleston, 25 miles 
northwest of the city, while other fires have broken out near Reno and Kearn

A total of 1,264 personnel are 
tackling the mt Charleston blaze - which has grabbed media attention due
to its proximity to urban areas - including more than 750 firefighters 
and 18
elite Hotshot crews.

Smoke created a towering white cloud that stretched northeast, 
visible from downtown Las Vegas. The Clark County Department of Air 
Quality has issued health advisories due to the relentless smoke.

An
influx of firefighters and equipment including bulldozers, seven 
helicopters, four air tankers and a DC-10 jet fire retardant bomber 
arrived in the area as other fast-moving fires were reported across the 
state.

On Tuesday, helicopters flew more than 43 hours and dropped 162,000 gallons of water on the fire.

Meanwhile, 700 miles away, near Yarnell, in Arizona, the funeral for 19 firefighters who lost their lives battling wildfires on June 30 took place.

Further north, a 26-square-mile fire has burned through the Pine Nut Mountains southwest of Reno while further south salt cedar trees have caught fire along the San Pedro River bed outside the remote community of Kearn.

Pinal County Deputy Chief Steve Henry 
said the new fire had claimed a home and two other structures. It also 
threatened the local airport in the town of some 2,000 residents.

Residents of a trailer park were evacuated as a precaution. It was unclear how it started. The Arizona Republic reported the fire had spread across 300 acres by late last night. 

In northern Nevada, the Bison Fire in the Pine Nut Mountains straddling the Douglas and Lyon county lines nearly doubled in size yesterday from a day earlier as it burned through tinder-dry brush, dead trees and pinion-juniper forests. By afternoon the fire was estimated at 17,500 acres, or more than 27 square miles.

The mountain range also stretches into Carson City. Late in the day, fire officials closed popular back-country roads leading from the state capital into the mountains because of the fire's path.

The blaze broke out on July 4 and firefighters initially hoped to have it contained Monday. But those ambitions were dashed Sunday when strong winds fanned the fire into an inferno that pushed to the northeast and created a towering, swirling smoke plume seen for miles.

No homes have been lost, but officials said several old structures burned in the Slater Mine area.

More
than 700 firefighters battled winds, low humidity and steep terrain to 
clear fire breaks through grass, pinion and juniper.

Firefighters
lost ground yesterday on all of the Nevada fires, which each were about
15 per cent contained. Fire managers expecting crews to spend a week on
both fire lines.

No injuries were reported in the southern Nevada fire and no structures burned in the fire since it started on the west side of Mount Charleston near Pahrump and quickly spread east into rugged terrain reachable only on foot. Officials said yesterday that some $2.4 million had already been spent fighting the fire.

Mount Charleston is a popular weekend getaway, where summer temperatures can be 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in Las Vegas, which has sizzled in the triple digits for more than 10 days.

More than 400 homes in Trout, Kyle, Lee, Harris Springs and Lovell canyons were evacuated during the weekend, along with a Clark County-run youth correctional camp that houses 98 teenagers at a mountain elevation of almost 8,500 feet above sea level.

State highways 156 and 157 were closed into the canyons, and evacuation shelters were set up at schools in Las Vegas and Pahrump.

Crews were also working to protect about 100 non-residential structures including barns, sheds and corrals, Nichols said.

Daytime high temperatures on the mountain were expected to decrease over the next few days after peaking at 90 degrees on Saturday, but firefighters were hampered by gusty winds and humidity levels in the single digits.

The fire, named Carpenter 1, was declared a top priority nationwide due to its size and the value of homes and structures at risk, said Suzanne Shelp, a Forest Service spokeswoman.

'This fire, these last few days and going forward, is going to depend on the weather,' Shelp said.
