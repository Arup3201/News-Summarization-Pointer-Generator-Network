U.S. prisoner of war Bowe Bergdahl could have his life turned into a film by the team behind Zero Dark Thirty, the big-screen dramatisation of the hunt for Osama bin Laden.

The director and producer of the award-winning film are rumoured to be 'in the early stages' of planning a feature after following Bergdahl's story 'for several years'.

Sergeant Bergdahl spent five years in Taliban captivity after going missing from a U.S. Army post in Afghanistan.

Background:

Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in 
Afghanistan and being held captive for five years

New project: The team behind Zero Dark Thirty, pictured above, are reportedly planning to dramatise the life of the man who was until recently the only U.S. prisoner of war

Raid: Zero Dark Thirty was a timely rendition of the manhunt for Osama bin Laden, which culminated in a raid on his Pakistani compound, as depicted above in the film

He was released to the U.S. Government last month in a controversial prisoner swap which saw the White House hand back five dangerous Taliban leaders.

He was brought back to the United States last weekend as is currently recovering at an Army hospital.

His return has prompted speculation that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal could base a production on his five years as the country's only prisoner of war.

The two brought out Zero Dark Thirty, a dark portrayal of the ten-year manhunt and eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, just a year after he was killed in a raid on his Pakistan compound.

According to Deadline Hollywood, the film is in the works but only at a very preliminary stage.

It is also rumoured that Fox Searchlight are poised to dramatise Sergeant Bergdahl's life.

The film company is said to have acquired rights to a long-form investigative article about the soldier, written by Michael Hastings of Rolling Stone magazine.

Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday

Briefing: In their short briefing, the military said that Bergdahl will gradually be shown media reports abou his disappearance

Sergeant 
Bergdahl himself is still being looked after by the Army after his 
return on May 31. Yesterday military chiefs said he was being slowly 
informed of the huge attention surrounding his return, for which some 
have severely criticised the government.

He
 arrived in the predawn hours of Friday at Brooke Army Medical Center in
 San Antonio, Texas, on a military flight from Germany, dogged by 
questions surrounding his disappearance from a U.S. Army post in 
Afghanistan and the deal the Obama administration reached to free him.

'He is 
gradually being provided media coverage about him,' Colonel Hans Bush, a
 reintegration mission spokesman for U.S. Army South, said in a brief 
statement.

Colonel Bush said Sergeant Bergdahl is yet to be reunited with his parents and that he will decide when he wants to see them.

He said: 'He
 has acclimated to his time change from Germany. He is eating and 
sleeping on a routine schedule. His debriefings and medical care 
continue.'

The
 U.S. military said on Monday it had begun an investigation into 
Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan, with no time set for its 
completion.

While
 the Army also gave little information about his health and 
emotional state, officials said they were pleased with his physical 
state on arrival.

The
 military hospital in San Antonio where Sergeant Bergdahl has been receiving what
 the Army calls 'reintegration' treatment has teams of specialists and 
has been helping returning prisoners of war for decades.

The soldier was handed over to U.S. forces in Afghanistan on May 31 in exchange for
 five Taliban leaders held at the Guantanamo prison in Cuba.

His release
 initially sparked a wave of support that was quickly overshadowed by a 
political uproar over the freeing of the senior Taliban members.

Lawmakers
 criticized the Obama administration for failing to give them 30 days' 
notice before transferring prisoners from Guantanamo as required by law.

Some
 charged that in making the exchange, the administration had effectively
 violated its policy against negotiating with terrorists.

Some
 of Sergeant Bergdahl's former comrades in Afghanistan claim he had deserted 
when he walked away from his post, which led to his capture.

As he continues his rehabilitation at the Army medical center in San Antonio, Texas, the investigation into his disappearance will get under way.

Part of it will examine what led to Sergeant Bergdahl leaving his base, which resulted in his capture.

An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof he deserted.

Sergeant Bergdahl has not yet been reunited with his parents. It is not unusual for former hostages to delay meeting close friends and family, as it can be an emotional strain.Â

A spokesman for his parents, Bob and Jani, said they were overjoyed that he had returned to the U.S.

They are waiting for the right moment to visit their son, who is currently being cared for by a specially trained team who have been preparing for his return since he was first taken hostage.
