Argentina has made a formal complaint to its neighbour Uruguay after the country's president called his female Argentine counterpart an 'old hag'.

The famously candid Jose Mujica had no idea his microphone was switched on when he attacked Cristina Fernandez
de Kirchner, 60, moments before a press conference.

He was heard loudly: 'That old hag's worse than the cross-eyed one,' referring to Ms Kirchner's late husband and former Argentinian president Nestor Kirchner.

The 77-year-old added: 'Cross-eyes was more of a politician, she's just stubborn.'

Pouring scorn on his colleague, who has spoken out repeatedly to attack Britain over The Falklands, 77-year-old Mr Mujica then accused of failing to act appropriately when meeting the pope.

Ms Kirchner presented the Argentinian Pope Francisco with a flask to drink traditional 'mate' tea when she visited last month. Mr Mujica said: 'She actually went to the Pope, who has lived 77 years, to explain what is tea and what is a thermal flask.'

Argentina's foreign minister Hector Timermanmade a formal protest to the Uruguayan government about Mr Mujica's 'outrageous' remarks about the country's current and former presidents.

Remarks: Mr Mujica was also overheard referring to late Argentine President Nestor Kirchner as 'cross-eyed'

In a statement handed to Uruguayan Ambassador Guillermo Pomi he stressed Argentina's 'profound unease with the terms' used by Mr Mujica.

He said: 'It is unacceptable that such outrageous comments, which offend the memory of a deceased person who cannot defend himself, have been made by someone Kirchner considered her friend.'

Relations between the two South American countries have deteriorated in recent years as Ms Kirchner has restricted imports and limited access to foreign currencies, measures which have hurt Uruguay's exports and tourism industry.

Nestor Kirchner accused Uruguay of 'stabbing Argentina in the back' in 2007 after president Tabare Vazquez restarted operations at a pulp mill on a river bordering the two countries which Argentina had blockaded.

In 2002 Uruguayan president Jorge Batlle accused Argentinians of being 'a bunch of thieves,' a comment for which he later apologised during a trip to Buenos Aires.

Mr Mujica, a former guerrilla who took office in 2010, last night insisted he had not spoken publically about the Kirchners at the event in Uruguay and would not be offering clarifications.

He made headlines in June 2012, when his government made a move to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana.

He reportedly said that by regulating the $40 million-a-year illegal marijuana trade in his country the government could take it away from drug dealers.

Tension: Ms Kirchner attempted to hand Mr Cameron a package last June marked 'UN - Malvinas' but the Prime Minister refused to accept it

Tensions between Britain and Argentina have risen under Ms Kirchner's rule, with the president  continually asserting her country's claim to sovereignty over the Falkland Islands.

Her ambassador to London caused anger when she dismissed a recent referendum on the islands' future - in which residents voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining British - as a 'publicity stunt.'

Last June David Cameron was involved in an 
extraordinary stand-up row with Ms Kirchner over the future of the future of the islands - which are known as the Malvinas by Argentina.

Ms Kirchner appeared to 
attempt to thrust a package stuffed with documents about her country’s 
claim to the British territory into Mr Cameron’s hands at the G20 summit
in Mexico.

To her fury, the Prime Minister 
refused to accept it – and insisted that she respect the views of the 
islanders, who want to remain British.
