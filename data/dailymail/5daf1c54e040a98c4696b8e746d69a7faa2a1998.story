A 50lb vinyl peace sign has been stolen from a Mystic, Connecticut playground built in memory of one of the 20 children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.

The sign at the entrance to the Grace McDonnell playground disappeared Tuesday.

More horrific than the theft is that a man claiming to be the thief called Grace McDonnell's mother and taunted her over the death of her daughter.

Community outrage: The vinyl sign designed by Grace McDonnell before it was stolen

William Lavin, who has been leading the effort to build playgrounds to honor all 26 Newtown victims, told The Day of New London that a man called Grace's mother and told her he took the sign because he believes the December 2012 school shooting was a hoax.

'There's still a lot of ignorance and evil out there that someone could do something like that,' Lavin said Wednesday.

'It's sad there are ignorant people who have to show their hatred in a place that was built by a community that shared and expressed their love for the families in Newtown that witnessed evil.'

Lynn McDonnell was upset after the phone call and worried about how the theft might affect those who helped build the playground, Lavin said.

Double blow: The theft comes just after a sign in a different playground, one dedicated to Ana Grace Marquez-Greene, was graffitied

The foundation has ordered a replacement sign.

The incident comes less than a week after graffiti was found on another victim's memorial playground.

However, the message found spray-painted Sunday at the Ana Marquez Greene Memorial playground in Hartford read, "Peace to Sandy Hook," using a peace sign and the numeral "2." It was later removed.

Ana's mother, Nelba Marquez Greene, told WTNH-TV she was not upset with the graffiti and plans to raise money to put up a graffiti board to allow others to leave similar condolence messages.

Each playground is unique and inspired by the victims it is dedicated to.
