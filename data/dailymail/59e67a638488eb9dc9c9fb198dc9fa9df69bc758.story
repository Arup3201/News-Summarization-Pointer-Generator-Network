David Cameron last night spoke of his anguish when he feared his wife Samantha might have been killed in the 9/11 attacks on New York.

In an interview to mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks, the Prime Minister warned that Britain had ‘lost some of our moral authority’ in the way it responded – with controversy still raging over the war in Iraq and allegations of complicity in torture.

But he also recalled his own personal torment on the day al-Qaeda struck, when he spent hours trying to contact Samantha, who had flown to Manhattan on a business trip the previous day.

Concerns: David Cameron with wife Samantha. He has told how he feared she had been killed in the 9/11 attacks

Mr Cameron was at the family home in Oxfordshire on the day of the attacks while Samantha, who was two months pregnant with their first son Ivan, was in New York opening a new branch of the upmarket stationers Smythson, where she still works as a consultant.

Although she was in the shop a few miles from the World Trade Center, she was unable to tell her husband she was safe for five hours because the phone and mobile networks went into meltdown in the immediate aftermath of the attacks.

In an interview with the Arabic satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera, Mr Cameron said: ‘Samantha was actually in New York that day, in Manhattan, and I’ll never forget the hours of ringing her mobile over and over again and not being able to get through because the mobile phone system was down.

‘I remember exactly where I was when I finally did get through and how pleased I was to hear her voice.

‘And it made a huge impression on her because of what happened in New York that day and what people felt about it.

'Obviously
 it’s been one of the defining events of this century. And I think we’re
 still coming to terms with it and trying to get our response to it 
right.’

Mr Cameron defended his decision to 
vote for the Iraq War, but said ‘mistakes’ were made in the way the West
 responded to the threat from al Qaeda.

He
 said: ‘We can certainly see with hindsight, and in some ways at the 
time, mistakes were made in that we lost some of our moral authority, 
which is vital to keep when you’re trying to make your case in the 
world.’

The Prime Minister said the insistence on a UN resolution on Libya, the establishment of an inquiry into allegations of torture and the controversial decision to pay tens of millions of pounds in compensation to 16 Guantanamo Bay terror suspects with British links, were all evidence that the Coalition was working to restore Britain’s moral standing.

He said the decision to settle the Guantanamo Bay cases out of court was designed to ‘remove the stain from Britain and to make sure that our security services could get on with their work’.

Mr Cameron said he would stick to the deadline to withdraw all British combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, just before the planned date of the next General Election.

And he said the West had to focus on preventing al Qaeda  establishing a stronger foothold in ‘badly fractured’ states like Yemen and Somalia.

But he insisted the events of the Arab springe were a ‘hugely optimistic and hopeful moment for our world’.

Meanwhile, Tony Blair yesterday backed ‘regime change’ in Iran and Syria – as he warned the West still faced a major threat from terrorism 10 years after the 9/11 attacks.

The former Prime Minister said the threat posed by Islamist extremists would take a ‘generation of effort’ to defeat.

Mr Blair, who remains unrepentant about the bloody aftermath of the Iraq War, conceded that the West had underestimated the scale of the threat it faced from Islamist extremists.

He said that although only a tiny number of people were directly involved in terrorist attacks, the number sympathetic to al-Qaeda’s message was ‘worryingly large’.

He added: ‘The majority, as the Arab Spring shows, want what we want. But the minority are well organised and very determined and they are not confined to the ranks of suicide bombers.’

But Labour’s former Foreign Secretary David Miliband took a swipe at the ‘war on terror’ waged by Mr Blair in alliance with George W Bush in the wake of the 9/11 attacks – saying the words should

And he suggested the Iraq War had done more harm than good, adding: ‘I have to recognise that list of positives including Saddam gone, Kurds safe - but outweighed by the longer list of negatives.’
