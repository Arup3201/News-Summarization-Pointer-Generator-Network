An Indiana senator began questioning a Treasury official at a hearing on Thursday before realizing he was at the wrong committee meeting.

Senator Dan Coats, who was supposed to be at a veterans affairs meeting, only realized his mistake when an aide passed him a note.

The 70-year-old senator took the mistake in good humor as he admitted he was in the wrong place, causing the room to erupt into laughter.

Before his mistake was realized however, Coats had given a lengthy speech, and commended his department for quickly responding to a letter he had sent about a military accounting office.

Veteran: Coats has served on the Senate since 1989

As he finished questioning Treasury undersecretary David Cohen, instead of an undersecretary of defense, the Senator's aide alerted him to his mistake.

'I just got a note saying I'm at the wrong hearing,' Coats can be heard telling the room in a video posted online by Politico.

A relieved Cohen then said: 'Well, that would explain why I didn't know anything about this letter.'

Coats had been due to address the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee, but because of a timing mix up, ended up questioning Treasury official Cohen, who works on terrorism and financial intelligence.

Coats, who has had a long career in the Senate starting in 1989, said: 'I saw some familiar faces and I thought this is where I should be.'

He then told Cohen, who he had 
grilled about a letter: 'I hope you’re able to respond as quickly as the
 undersecretary of the Army responded.

'I’ll go try to find out where I’m supposed to be. Thank you.'

Coats first served in the Senate from 1989 to 1999, before a stint as Ambassador to Germany. He then returned in 2011.

Error: The veteran senator joked about his mistake on Twitter

The veteran Senator said he had never mixed up his meetings before, and jokingly said he hoped it wasn't a precursor of things to come.

He referred to the mix up on Twitter later on Thursday, tweeting: 'I think the Russians have been messing with my schedule.'

Coats made it to his actual hearing, which was scheduled to take place an hour later than he had realized.
