A Los Angeles woman who fractured her skull while riding on an open top Starline Tours bus last October plans to sue the company.

Lauren Guerra has accused the company of negligence after she was struck by a branch while on an open top section of the bus during a chartered Halloween trip.

The 35-year-old fractured her skull, shattered her left eye socket, damaged an eye muscle and has been left with double vision.

Treatment: Guerra, pictured before the accident, has had to pay $20,000 so far in medical treatment

Guerra announced her plans to sue after hearing about the death of Mason Zisette, who died last week in similar circumstances.

Tragic: Mason Zisette, 16, died last week after hitting his head on a bridge while on a Starlines Tour bus

The 16-year-old boy was hit by a bridge and died as he stood on an open section of a bus while it drove down a freeway.

Guerra said she brought forward her planned legal action 'After hearing about what happened to 
Mason and realizing that this company did nothing to prevent this from 
happening,' she told KTLA.

She said after her experiences she felt the company should have taken steps to improve safety.

Guerra claimed that during the ride she was injured on, the bus had been traveling at 45mph and everyone was trying to avoid being hit by branches.

'There were times when people had to duck under branches. I stood up at the wrong time and I got taken out going about 45mph by a rather large tree branch,' she told ABC7.

Guerra's medical bills have cost $20,000 so far, and she still has problems with her vision and needs further treatment.

She plans to sue Starline Tours for negligence and damages.

The complaint alleges that none of the passengers had received safety warnings about traveling on the upper deck, and no staff were on the bus to supervise.

Her attorney, Brian Kabateck, said: 'My client feels that after her incident, Starline should have done something to change what was happening on the bus.

'As a result of the fact that they made no changes and this poor young man died, she wanted to go public.'

Starline Tours has not yet responded to a MailOnline request for comment.
