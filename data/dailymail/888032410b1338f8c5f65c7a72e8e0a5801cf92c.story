A Missouri teacher has shared his remarkable story at losing almost 350 pounds and regaining power over his life.

Ryan Blocker says he found himself in all kinds of trouble when he tipped the scales at 550 pounds two years ago.

The Lilbourn High School teacher, who was 28 at the time, was so fat he could hardly manage the most basic of tasks, and was reliant on three blood pressure medications just to get through each day.

'I know I was heading down a bad path, it was a matter of time,' he told KFVS 12.

Battle of the bulge: Blocker now admits he was 'terrible' to himself

'I mean you don't live for 20 years at that weight. 

'Not taking any kind of care of yourself. 

'You just don't make it like that.'

His turning point came in August 2012 when he directing the high school band for the homecoming parade and almost collapsed. 

'By the end of the block I was at the back of the band and seeing spots and I couldn't catch my breath,' he recalls.

'And I had to just stop.'

Turning point: It was during march band practice, where Blocker almost collapsed, that he realized he had to change his lifestyle

Blocker sought help at The Healthy Weight at Saint Francis Medical Center on a doctor's recommendation, and he was put on a strict diet.

He was provided with pre-made meals and given an exercise plan that had to be met.

He also attended group nutrition classes for support.

The result?

Blocker went from size 56 to a 32.

'Obesity is a problem. Working in schools and just walking through town you see it,' Blocker said.

'If I can help them out or inspire them or give them information on how to eat better i'm glad to do it. 

'Because I feel like I owe that to them. 

'I mean I was terrible to myself. I might as well help somebody else out.'

Now, when Blocker approaches students that he used to teach, they don't recognize him.

He has often had to whip out his driver's license to prove he is Mr Blocker.
