Fight: David Cameron used a speech to workers at the new London Gateway container port near Tilbury in Essex to warn against declaring 'stop the world I want to get off'

David Cameron today attacked Labour for dismissing people worried about immigration and the over-bearing power of Brussels as 'Little Englanders'.

The Prime Minister used a major speech on Britain's place in the world to condemn the other 
'wrongheaded approach' of people who embrace globalisation 'so 
enthusiastically that they lose sight of the national interest'.

He said: 'We’re familiar with their frankly patronising approach to those who may disagree. 

'"You’re a Little Englander" they say. "You don’t get the modern world".

'This approach – largely pursued under the last Government – didn’t feel too good for ordinary people – and frankly it didn’t do too much for our competitiveness either. 

'We saw mass, uncontrolled immigration changing communities in a way people didn’t feel comfortable with, putting huge pressure on public services.

'We saw large bureaucracies like the EU having a huge impact on our way of life in a way no one voted for, while at the same time burdening our businesses with red tape and regulation.

'We saw, fundamentally, a political class too easily seduced by the rewards of globalisation – and not alert enough to the risks.'

However, Mr Cameron also insisted that remaining part of the European Union is vital to Britain being able to compete in the world.

He vowed to take on people who adopt a 'stop the world, I want to get off' approach and ignore the threat posed by 'leaner, fitter countries'.

He claimed opponents to reforms of the ‘bloated welfare system’ and underperforming state schools are 'in denial'.

The Prime Minister lay out three key goals - creating a world-class education system, reforming benefits and rebalancing the debt-fuelled economy - which he described as ‘national weaknesses’.

In a bullish speech ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland next week, he revealed ‘ruthless’ plans to ‘turn our country around and give all our people the best chance of success’.

Taking on welfare spending, after a week in which the Labour party finally committed to caps on benefits, and economists predicted that austerity could last another decade, he said: ‘We have identified, very clearly, our key areas of national weakness compared to the rest of the world.

‘One – our debt-fuelled, unbalanced economy. Two – our bloated welfare system. Three – our under-performing education system.

‘These are the priorities that define and drive our domestic agenda. A stronger economy. Welfare that works. A world-class education system. And we are pursuing them with ruthless ambition for everyone in this country.’

He attacked Labour’s record on education, and say a ‘sense of opportunity’ has been lacking for too long for children in the worst performing schools.

Britain’s national interests are a battle ‘on two fronts’, with the need to both competing at home and stand up for British values abroad, and every government department will be focused on the global race, he said.

He also set a goal to make Britain one of the top five places in the world to do business and the number one country to do business in Europe in the next three years.

'When your prosperity is won in far-flung places, when your fortunes are disproportionately affected by what happens beyond your borders then your national interest is not just about standing up for yourself – but standing up for what’s right, and standing for something more. 

‘At the UN. The Commonwealth. NATO. The WTO. The G8. The G20. And yes – the EU. Membership of these organisations is not national vanity – it is in our national interest’, he said.

‘The fact is that it is in international
institutions that many of the rules of the game are set on trade, tax 
and regulation. When a country like ours is affected profoundly by those
rules, I want us to have a say on them.

‘That doesn’t mean supinely going with the flow…far from it. At the European Union we are prepared to stand up for Britain’s interests with resolve and tenacity.

Vision: Mr Cameron lay out three key goals - creating a world-class education system, reforming benefits and rebalancing the debt-fuelled economy

'In Europe, actions speak louder than words. This is about boldly pursuing our interests - not by withdrawing from the world but engaging with it.’

Mr Cameron boasted of how he secured a cut in the EU's seven-year budget, removing Britain from the Eurozone bailout mechanism and vetoing an EU Treaty.

But Mr Cameron argued a single market of 500million people in Europe would be a ‘huge advantage in this world’ if it worked properly and was not bureaucratic.

He added: ‘The EU is a way off that goal yet’ which is why he is seeking to negotiate a new membership deal for Britain and put it to a referendum.

He highlighted investment in apprenticeships which are equivalent of a degree, and ‘re-writing the benefits system so that work actually pays.’

He went on: ‘I have a very clear vision of the country we are building. It’s
one where there is a sense of opportunity that was lacking for too 
long.

'Where children in all our schools – in the roughest areas, the 
places that were once written off are encouraged to dream, inspired to 
learn and feel good about where they’re going.

‘Where those who want to work hard can get a good job, with prospects and a decent wage each month - enough for a home to raise their family in, enough to feel that things are getting better.

'As a parent what you want more than anything is to be able to look at your children and know they will grow up and be able to fulfil what they were born to be.

‘We tell them that if they try, they can make something of their lives. That is what we teach our children. And we need to build that country for them. Where everyone who works hard can get on. Where effort is rewarded. Where we pull together to make life better.’
