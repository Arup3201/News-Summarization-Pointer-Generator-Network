Singles holidays are on the rise, with the biggest surge in demand from the over 50s traveller, according to research out today.

Holiday companies that run group tours in the UK and overseas are reporting that 35 per cent of their clients now travel alone and they expect this figure to rise to 38 per cent in 2015, based on advance bookings. 

As a result, many holiday companies, including Cox & Kings, Caribtours and Journey Latin America are offering incentives to attract people who are single, divorced or widowed, such as dedicated holidays for people travelling alone and, increasingly, the scrapping of single supplements.

More and more of us are opting for singles holidays with the over 50s having the highest demand

The analysis of 100,000 holiday bookings was carried out by 101 Holidays which has launched a new website to meet the demand, 101 Singles Holidays.

The site has 101 suggestions for solo travellers selected by the award-winning travel writer, Cathy Winston.

Winston said: 'Travelling solo has lost much of the lonely hearts stigma it once carried. And it's not limited to the 18-30 age group backpacking around the world, with single people of all ages feeling more confident about travelling alone, especially women. 

Greece remains the most popular destination for singles, with a nice mix of sun, sea and.... other singles

New trips such as trkking in Nepal are becoming popular with people who go away on their own

'Our research showed that the average age of a solo traveller is now 54 and this is predicted to rise in future years.

'Not everyone holidaying alone is single, with more women leaving husbands and partners at home as they tick items off their bucket lists. The new figures also reflect changing UK demographics with a growing population that is older, healthier and wealthier.'

1. Greece

2. Portugal

3. St Lucia

4. Laos

5. Sri Lanka

6. Singapore

7. USA

8. Costa Rica

9. Turkey

10. Vietnam (as part of a small group tour)

According to the research, 58.3 per cent of single holidaymakers are female. But that figure rises for more active and exotic trips such as walking holidays (64 per cent) and African safaris (60 per cent). Men are more likely to take cycling and sailing trips.

The most popular destination for dedicated singles holidays is Greece, followed by Turkey, but travel companies say many solos are increasingly looking for adventure. Popular trips include cruises on the River Nile, trekking in Nepal, viewing the Northern Lights and gorilla trekking in Rwanda.

The report by 101 Holidays is supported by research from the Association of British Travel Agents. 

Its 2014 Consumer Holiday Trends Report found that 13 per cent of UK holidaymakers now travel alone. But, it said, 'for people aged over 65 the figure rises to 21 per cent, suggesting older age groups are among the most independent when it comes to taking holidays'.

Cathy Winston added: 'Increasingly, travel companies are waking up to the fact that single travellers are big business with a huge choice of solo holidays now on offer, and some are negotiating with hotels to remove the dreaded single supplements. This is a trend that looks only set to increase.'

The Northern Lights can offer a supremely peaceful moment that can be enjoyed whether with others or alone

Cathy also points to an increasing growth in single parent holidays, with several companies scrapping supplements for mums or dads travelling alone with their kids.

Recent years have also seen a sharp hike in self-development and learning holidays which are growing in popularity among singles - including meditation, yoga, pilates, weight loss, cookery courses and creative writing.

Making friends and joining a 'group' is a good way to stay safe on holiday

Look confident 

Look like you know where you're going even if you don't, and always try to learn a few key words in the local language including 'help'.

Do your research 

Spontaneous travel is wonderful but a bit of advance planning goes a long way. Try to memorise routes so you needn't look at maps too often, and try to avoid arriving late at night, but book taxis/transfers/accommodation in advance if you can't avoid that. Expat blogs can also be a great source of tips and information.

Dress sensibly 

You'll attract more negative attention and mark yourself out as a tourist by wearing inappropriate clothes. Instead look at the advice on what travellers should wear to ensure it's respectful to local culture, and you're more likely to blend in.

Join a group 

If you're planning a more intrepid adventure and you're nervous about going solo, book a group tour with a travel company specialising in your destination as there's often a large proportion travelling solo. For something more informal check out websites like Travbuddy, Wandermates and Meetup, to help you you meet other solo travellers.

Don't forget common sense 

You wouldn't be careless with your valuables or walk alone at night in a strange city in the UK, so don't do it while you're travelling. Danger doesn't lurk around every corner but do stay alert.

Book a guide 

If you're worried about being hassled, a guide is a great barrier. Even a short tour will help you find your bearings and get advice from a local before venturing out alone.

Learn to say no politely 

Declining firmly with a smile and a thank you is the quickest way to deter all but the most insistent without unintentionally causing offence.

Trying to stay relatively sober if travelling as a single on holiday is a good idea

Stay (fairly) sober 

Travel is all about enjoying yourself but having one too many drinks is a shortcut to potentially unsafe situations, whether that's being more inclined to take risks or simply getting lost.

Protect your paperwork 

Make scans of all your important documents, especially your passport, with a copy safely stored online, for example with Dropbox. Then if something is stolen, you can easily access the back-up. And always get a note of your hotel's address and phone number, written in the local alphabet if it's different.

Trust your instincts 

If something feels wrong or someone makes you feel uncomfortable, don't ignore your instincts for the sake of politeness. There's usually a good reason for your gut reaction so if you feel even slightly unsafe, get out as fast as possible.
