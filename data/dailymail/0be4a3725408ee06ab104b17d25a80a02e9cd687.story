Brendan Rodgers insists he has no problem with the treatment dished out to Mario Balotelli by Aston Villa defender Philippe Senderos during Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Anfield.

Liverpool boss Rodgers, who said football is a 'man's game', saw Balotelli kicked by Senderos in the first-half in an off-the-ball incident, which the referee and his assistants missed. 

Balotelli was also on the receiving end of a hefty challenge from right-back Alan Hutton.

Senderos then had another swipe at the Italian, which the referee completely missed

And although Rodgers says Balotelli should have been given protection by referees, he said there were no complaints overall.

Rodgers said: 'We expect the referee to protect all our players, not just Mario.

'It is a man’s game. It is a competitive game but if it oversteps the mark when he’s not involved in the build-up then we would expect the referee and officials to look at it.

'But there are no complaints for me. Football is competitive and strong and we ask the players to be that in our team but be fair in the way we work.'

Rodgers has set his sights on the knockout stages after he insisted Liverpool have earned the right to be in the Champions League.

Liverpool end a five-year absence from Europe’s premier competition on Tuesday evening with a home game against FC Ludogorets and Rodgers has admitted he is ready to embrace the challenges that await in the coming months.

Ludogorets will be viewed as the weak link in Group B but Liverpool will have no easy task progressing as they also face reigning champions Real Madrid and the improving Swiss side FC Basel.

Rodgers, however, believes his squad’s time to be at this level has come. They finished second in the Barclays Premier League last season, losing the title by just two points to Manchester City, and Rodgers wants Liverpool to be rubbing shoulders with the biggest names in the new year.

He said: 'I am very excited. Five years is a long time. We deserve the right to be in it. We had a great season.

'Success is about qualifying from the group. We will take it one game at a time. But the overall first objective is to get out of the group and qualify.'

But Rodgers is taking nothing for granted, even if fans will expect a comfortable victory against their Bulgarian opposition.

He said: 'Like all games at this level, it will be a tough game. They are the top team in Bulgaria and we have done a lot of research on them. They play 4-2-3-1 and the full-backs push up. They want to attack.

'They come here with confidence and will want to perform like they are in Bulgaria. We now have to be really aggressive with our pressing and passing. We know they will be a tough opponent.'

Liverpool struggled defensively against Aston Villa and while the manager confirmed Martin Skrtel will soon return he also admitted that more work was needed.

'We need to be better in those areas,' said Rodgers. 'We were disappointed with the goal we conceded. It is going to take that little bit of time. Our emphasis will always be positive but, for sure, we have got to tighten up.' 

Liverpool have not played a Champions League match since they lost to Fiorentina 2-1 in 2009, a result which saw them finish third in their group. But the five-time winners are back and, for Rodgers, it's not a moment too soon.

He said: 'It is only the last couple of days that it has brought home how long it has been a way. This was my main priority to get the club at this level.  

As well as Bulgarian side Ludogorets, Liverpool will face Real Madrid and Swiss side Basel in their group

'This is one of the football greats around the world and this is the elite competition. This game can’t come quick enough for us. I have had supporters in my office, telling me about it. We do this for our supporters.

'The key is to build towards making this a sustainable club. The Champions League is the elite level.'

Meanwhile, Dejan Lovren admitted Liverpool were still feeling the effects of the defeat to Aston Villa, but claimed the club just needs to move on. 

He said: 'We have shown to everyone that we can play and are not scared about defeats. Aston Villa was a little bit painful, we didn’t expect it but it happens. We need to keep our head up and concentrate. We need to move on. 

'We have the Champions League now and we have to forget (about Villa).Of course we need to improve in every game but I am really confident in our team. We are practically a new team with a lot of new players. Everything will settle down.

'I think for everyone it is a pleasure to be back in after five years. We want success here. I will not say that we have got an easy group but I am sure that we can pass (out of) the group.'

Unlike some of Lovren's team-mates, though, this is not his first time playing in the competition.

He said: 'It will help me (having played for Lyon). I think I have played 21/22 games in the Champions League and I know what can happen. It is something different to the Premier League. 

'I think I am ready to play in the Champions League and I can’t wait to start. It will be something different. It will be a massive game. 

'It is a big part of football, it is not the same thing to play in the Champions League for Lyon as it is for Liverpool. We just need to concentrate, be calm and play our style of the game. '
