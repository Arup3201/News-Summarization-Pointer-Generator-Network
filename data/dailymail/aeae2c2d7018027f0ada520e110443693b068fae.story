Thousands of people lined the streets of Preston today to pay their last respects to Sir Tom Finney, one of the greatest footballers in English history.

Dozens of legendary players attended the winger's funeral, which took place two weeks after he died at the age of 91.

Roads were packed as the funeral cortege travelled from Deepdale stadium, where Finney played for Preston North End his whole career, to Preston Minster.

The man known as the 'Preston Plumber' won 76 caps and scored 30 international goals, and played for Preston 569 times in his 14 years at the club.

Sir Trevor Brooking, the former England international who represented the Football Association at the funeral service, said: 'He was one of the most genuine invidividuals you would ever be likely to meet.

'Everyone admired and respected him. To come to this event today, over 50 years since he played, and see all these people both here in the minster and on the streets, I can't think of many who would get the same reaction.

'As a player, he was the match-winner, the crowd-pleaser, the one who could make the difference - I was a youngster in primary school when he was playing, I would watch him on a black and white telly and then go out into the garden with my brother to try to emulate him.'Â

Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey was also among those at the service, and he said: 'The great and the good of football have come out to say farewell to Sir Tom Finney - a man who was a genuine legend of our game.

'You only have to mention Preston and Preston North End... the conversation soon turns to Tom Finney and that sums up everything the man did for the club, the city and the game of football.'

David Moyes, the Manchester United boss who started his coaching career at Preston, attended the service, as did England's record goalscorer Sir Bobby Charlton.

The funeral cortege travelled from Preston's Deepdale home - Finney was born on a street next to the stadium in 1922 - with a mounted police escort from the Lancashire Constabulary to the minster.

The Preston and District Veterans' Association also joined the cortege to mark his service as a tank driver in the Royal Armoured Corps during the Second World War.

The funeral service was shown live on a big screen inside Preston's ground to a crowd of several thousand people.

Preston
 City Council had planned for tens of thousands to line the streets, 
with a number of schools giving children time off to attend the event.

Finney's father insisted he train as a plumber, and he continued working in the family business throughout his career.

He was regarded as one of the true greats of English football - and his record of caps and goals came despite having lost six years to the war.

FIFA's British vice-president Jim Boyce represented the world governing body at the funeral.

He said: 'Tom Finney was one of my boyhood heroes, and played in a day where footballers were earning a fraction of the money they earn today, and became a fantastic ambassador for Preston - the city and the club.

'It has been fantastic to see so many people turn out to show their affection to one of the game's true greats.'

Preston chairman Peter Ridsdale said Finney had 'touched the hearts' of the community.

He said: 'What I think is wonderful is that so many people - not only from the game but also from the city - have turned out to say farewell.

'This is a player that truly touched the hearts not just of football, but the whole community.

'The whole of Preston has almost come to a standstill in the two weeks since his death, and that is testament to what a great man he was.'
