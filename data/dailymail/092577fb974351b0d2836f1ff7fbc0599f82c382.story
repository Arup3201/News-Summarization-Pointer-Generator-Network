When the two top teams in Serie A met on Sunday night, it was always going to be a feisty encounter. That it was settled by a piece of brilliance, rather than a refereeing howler, was reassuring, but not entirely fitting.

Not only do these two teams not like each other, but there was also a huge amount at stake - neither side had dropped a point yet in the league this season. 

But few could have predicted just how much controversy would be crammed into  this clash, during which referee Gianluca Rocchi awarded three penalties in the first half and showed two red cards in the closing stages, nor the source of the stunning winner.

With just four minutes remaining, centre half Leonardo Bonucci unleashed an unstoppable volley from the edge of the box to win the game, connecting beautifully with a cleared corner.

It was a goal worthy of winning any game, but this match will be remembered for so much more.

The controversy began with a Juventus freekick in the 26th minute. Pirlo struck it, and it struck defender Maicon on the arm, seemingly just outside the box. 

Rocchi awarded a freekick, but, once the Juventus players had pointed to his magic spray line, clearly inside the area, changed his mind. 

Carlos Tevez dispatched the penalty, Rudi Garcia was sent to the stands for his reaction, apparently immitating playing a violin.

Juventus had still not conceded in their five league games this season, and would have been confident that Tevez's penalty was a significant advantage. But Roma are a different prospect, and this game had much more drama to come.

Just five minutes after going ahead, Juventus shot themselves in the foot, Swiss defender Stephan Lichsteiner inexplicably wrestling Francesco Totti to the floor inside the box.

If Rocchi was looking for an opportunity to level things up, he could not have asked for a more blatant one. Totti, like Tevez, made no mistake from twelve yards.

Now it was Roma who had a spring their step, and a minute before half time they were ahead.

Gervinho, the danger-man so often since his move from Arsenal, drove at the defence before slipping in Juan Iturbe, who finished nicely. 

The home support were getting restless - they are not used to being behind - but Mr Rocchi was on hand to level things up again just a minute later.

Paul Pogba cut in from the left hand side, and as he passed Seydou Keita, the French midfielder went to ground. 

Contact, if there was any, was minimal. Where it occured, if anywhere, was the subject of much debate, but Rocchi decided it was just inside, rather than just outside, the box. 

Cue Tevez again. Same corner. Same result. Two goals each at half time.

In truth, the second half looked like it might not be living up to the drama of the first. Both sides pushed for the win, but neither looked particularly likely to get it before Bonucci stepped up.

However, it was only right, in a game like this, that the last word should go to the referee. Kostas Manolas, superb until this moment of madness, squared up to Alvaro Morata. 

The two clashed heads, but, in truth, neither needed more than a yellow card for what was more handbags than a true fight.

Rocchi decided otherwise though. Both players were dismissed. The referee was back in centre stage.
