Becky Beaumont, 22 suffered her first stroke in October 2011. She was making a good recovery until a second one struck this August

A brave young woman who fought back from a stroke at the age of 21 has suffered another setback less than a year later. 

Becky Beaumont was 21 when she suffered her first stroke last October and was left completely paralysed down her left side.

She was making a good recovery until she suffered a second stroke in August this year, this time affecting her right arm.

Fortunately it was not as serious as the first - but Miss Beaumont is having to undergo further rehabilitation.

She has refused to let her ill-health get her down and has launched a moving blog, where she writes about her recovery.

Miss Beaumont's ordeal began when she woke up one morning last year and was unable to reach for her phone next to her bed.

Miss Beaumont, who had been training to be a hairdresser, at first thought she had 'pins and needles from sleeping funny'. But when she reached with her right hand to touch the left side of her face, she realised it had drooped. 'I just knew I'd had a stroke,' she said.

She explains this terrifying moment in more detail on her blog, www.luckygirlbec.blogspot.co.uk.

She writes: 'In my whole life and in my years to come I don't think I'll ever feel as lonely, vulnerable and helpless as I did in those silent minutes that I lay, motionless in my bed.

'Looking back, the seconds that went by seemed like decades, and the panic was escalating. My body wasn't working, and all I could think was, "Please God, let my voice work." With all my might and will, I screamed for my mum.

Her mother Julie, 50, rang for an ambulance and she was taken to Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport where doctors diagnosed the condition.

A stroke is an attack which happens when the blood supply to the brain is cut off. Around 150,000 people a year are affected. The average age people have a stroke is 75 so when Miss Beaumont arrived at hospital, doctors at first thought she must have an infection.

However, scans confirmed it had been a stroke due to a blood clot on her brain that had been caused by a previously undetected hole in her heart.

She was given clot-busting drugs, as well as intensive physiotherapy, and felt she was over the worst of it.

But in August she suffered a setback when she was hit by another stroke, this time affecting her right arm.

She said: 'It was a massive shock when I had my first stroke - I just thought it affected old or physically unfit people. 

'I was absolutely fine before my stroke but then I woke up early and found I couldn’t move my left arm or leg. I thought it was just pins and needles but then realised it was more serious. It’s been a tough year and I’m still in recovery.

'I can walk but I’ve been left with a limp and my arms and legs still don’t work properly. It has completely changed my life.'

Miss Beaumont is also helping Stroke Association raise awareness of the condition - and the fact it can affect young people

Miss Beaumont, who is engaged to Chris Coe, 22, added: 'I haven’t let the strokes dampen my fighting spirit. I am determined to make a full recovery in time, and with the support of my family, friends and fiance I know I’ll get there.

Her blog has already had almost 500,000 hits. 'The response to my blog has been incredible. It has allowed me to connect with other young stroke survivors, and made me realise that I am not alone. Hopefully it will change people’s idea about strokes. I had no idea that it could happen at any age, until it happened to me.'

She is also raising awareness of the condition - and the fact it can affect young people - with the Stroke Association charity, helping to launch Style for Stroke - a designer collection of eight black dresses, sold in aid of the Stroke Association. 

Celebrity style expert Nick Ede founded the campaign, working with fashion label Little Mistress.

Louise Kay, fundraising manager for the Stroke Association, added: 'We are delighted that Nick and Little Mistress have launched this initiative in support of the Stroke Association. The money raised will go a long way in helping us to support people to make the best recovery they can.'
