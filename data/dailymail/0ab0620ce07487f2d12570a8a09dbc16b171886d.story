Their plight has never been so desperate - the African elephant is hurtling towards extinction as a result of mass poaching, according to campaigners.

It is estimated that more than 20,000 were killed on the continent last year for their ivory tusks - which earn a fortune as they are traded illegally in China and south-east Asia. 

Their tragic situation has led British wildlife photographer, Paul Goldstein, to make an impassioned plea to the public about elephant conservation - using his majestic photo album, taken over 25 years of watching the animals.

The award-winning photographer, from Wimbledon, south-west London, has also spent 16 years working as a guide for Exodus travels, a company that specialises in adventure holidays.

In the lead up to World Elephant Day on August 12, Mr Goldstein is urging people to spare a thought for the fate of elephants, which some believe could be poached to extinction in little more than a decade.

He has spent 25 years in the African bush capturing the animals on camera while also giving lectures on wildlife, photography and conservation.

He co-owns Kicheche Camps in Kenya, a base for luxury safaris, and has previously run marathons in a 10ft Bengal tiger suit to raise money and awareness for the animal.  

Despite the elephants' grave situation, Mr Goldstein believes collective action could still save the wonderful species from becoming a footnote in history.

The last decade has seen a huge rise in poaching, with organised crime syndicates and rebel militias looking for ways to fund their operations in Africa, becoming increasingly involved.

The demand for ivory, also referred to as white-gold, is at its highest in China, where it is used in decorations and in traditional medicines, fueling a multi-billion-pound illicit trade.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there were around 10 million elephants roaming across Africa -that number fell to 1.2 million by 1980 and currently stands at about 500,000,  according to CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)

Organised crime syndicates and rebel militias looking for ways to fund their operations in Africa have become increasingly involved in the ivory trade, eager to reap the benefits as demand in China rises

In 2011, about 25,000 of the world's largest land mammals were killed and the number was around 22,000 in 2012

It's estimated that more than 20,000 African elephants were poached last year alone for their tusks which rake in a fortune per kilogram on the Asian black market
