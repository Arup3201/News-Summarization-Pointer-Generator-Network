A teenager who was barred from the Army because he has a nut allergy accused military top brass of 'dietary discrimination' today.

Adam John, 18, was told he could not be given nut-free products while out on the frontline even though the Army will cater for vegetarians and provide halal and kosher food for Muslim and Jewish squaddies.

Now the teenager from Bolton, Greater Manchester, intends to spark a debate in Parliament about the issue by starting an e-petition.

Adam, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'The UK Armed Forces are the best in the world and can surely be able to cater for those with nut allergies'

Adam, who has just completed his A-levels at Bolton Sixth Form College, is hoping to carry on his studies at Manchester University this autumn.

He said: 'Joining the Army means you get to the travel the world while serving your country - there is no better job.'

The former Smithills School pupil only found out he was barred when he tried to sign up and saw the restrictions on the form. 

He said: 'I was so shocked, I had never heard about this before. I feel it is extremely discriminatory.

'It has been my dream to join as an officer or soldier in the infantry on completion of university and yet I’m prevented from doing so.'

Adam has had two allergic reactions - one when he was 12 while on holiday in the U.S. and last year at the age of 17, when he was diagnosed with the allergy and issued with an EpiPen, which he can use to inject himself with a life-saving adrenaline shot. 

He said: 'The UK Armed Forces are the best in the world and can surely be able to cater for those with nut allergies.

Other conditions that can prevent you joining the British Army include:

'They can prepare other foods carefully for those who eat halal or kosher because for a Muslim to eat pork is a huge issue and care has to be taken to deliver those dietary requirements.

'I am prepared to sign a disclaimer that if I have an allergic reaction I will not sue - that is how much I want to join.'

The same restrictions apply in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

Adam is now urging people to sign his e-petition in a bid to force a ministerial debate on it in the House of Commons.

He would need 100,000 signatures to force a debate, but so far only has 30.
