Her family has been rocked by divorce, depression and teenage angst this year, but Kris Jenner is still determined to present a picture perfect image to the world. 

The Kardashian matriarch decided to dig through the archives to find a vintage happy snap to post along with a Thanksgiving message on Thursday.

The 59-year-old used a promotional image from season 8 of Keeping Up With The Kardashian's that was released in May last year.

Portrait of a happy family: Kris Jenner used this promotional image from Keeping Up With The Kardashians from May 2013 in her Thanksgiving message on Thursday 

She even had to crop Khloe Kardashian's estranged husband Lamar Odom out of the frame.

She wrote: 'Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!! I am so Thankful for my amazing beautiful family and give thanks every single day.....have an amazing day �� #blessed' 

Of course, the reality isn't quite so glossy. 

Kris filed for divorce from her husband Bruce Jenner in September following a tense separation. 

Since their split, he has shaved his Adam's apple, grown a ponytail, been pictured with hot pink nails and found himself the subject of rumours he's transitioning into a woman.

The 65-year-old has also been romantically linked to Kris Jenner's longtime friend Ronda Kamihira.

For her part, Kris has moved on with a toyboy named Corey Gamble, 33. 

In the portrait, her only son Rob Kardashian, 27, is beaming for the camera. 

But in recent months he has retreated from the spotlight after gaining weight and struggling with depression. 

Kylie Jenner, who looks so sweet and smiley in the happy snap, is now rarely seen with her trademark overdone pout with a moody pose to go with it.  

New tradition:The family are spending Thanksgiving at Khloe Kardashian's place this year rather than at Kris' home

The family are spending Thanksgiving at Khloe Kardashian's place this year rather than at Kris' home.

Kris, Khloe's pregnant sister Kourtney and her partner Scott Disick and their children, Mason, four, and Penelope, two, Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West and their daughter North and Rob are expected to attend.

It's unclear if Bruce and the younger Jenner girls will join in.   

She posted on Twitter this week: 'Happy Thanksgiving my loves ... Im hosting Thanksgiving dinner at my house 4 my fam! This is a first. We always go2 my mama's house, so this year I'm really really excited ... Already been cooking for hours! I started some dishes yesterday and I'm still going strong I love to cook! (sic)'

What a change: Since the image was released in May 2010, Bruce has had his Adam's apple shaved down, grown a pony tail and been pictured with a manicure (right in October). He has also been romantically linked to Kris's friend Ronda Kamihira

Tough times: Rob (pictured right in July) has retreated from the spotlight after gaining weight and struggling with depression. He company Arthur George has released a new loungewear line, but he has made no personal attempts to promote it

Time for a toyboy! Kris is now dating Corey Gamble (picture right earlier this month). At 33, he is around the same age as her Kardashian daughters

Selfie obsessed: Kylie Jenner's sweet smile has been replaced by a moody and overdone pout in recent times. Meanwhile, model Kendall has tried to distance herself professionally from her famous family by dropping her last name and banning her sister Kim from her catwalk shows

On the rocks: Kourtney and Scott (pictured right last week) are expecting their third child but their tumultuous relationship has been under strain since the death of both his parents. Despite her efforts to get him to stop drinking and focus on family, he has maintained his party lifestyle

Life after Lamar: Kris cropped Odom out of her Thanksgiving message. In real life, French Montana has stepped in as Khloe Kardashian's leading man following the sad demise of her marriage to the troubled basketball player

Kim comes out on top: Kris' golden child is riding high - she is still married to Kanye West, is a busy mom to daughter North and is happier than ever with her body. Her naked ambition reached a new level with a full frontal shoot in Paper magazine earlier this month
