Amie Miller died aged 15 of encephalitis, a disease which causes swelling of the brain

The parents of a schoolgirl who died after a catalogue of errors at a failing hospital told how they were forced to endure ‘five years of torture’ as they battled to find out the truth behind the tragedy.

Amie Miller, 15, died of a brain injury just days after she was admitted to hospital with agonising headaches.

Doctors failed to carry out basic neurological checks which might have saved her life.

But nobody from the hospital would even meet the family – even though the mother worked at the hospital – to discuss their concerns for more than a year.

They then had to fight for four more years to get an inquest.

Yesterday, that inquest jury found medics at Basildon Hospital in Essex missed a string of opportunities to save Amie’s life in 2008.

In a damning narrative verdict, they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps – such as checking whether she could open her eyes, or examining the size of her pupils – which might have alerted them to her injury.

Doctors also administered the wrong treatments – which may have made her condition worse.

After the inquest, Amie’s stepfather Mbarek Aitmarri said the past five years had been torture.

He said the hospital – which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates – had ‘evaded’ responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged.

Mr Aitmarri, a pharmacy technician, said: ‘From the moment Amie died we faced constant evasion and were passed from one person to another. This has tortured us for the last five years.’

Amie's step-father Mbarek says his other children have struggled to cope and won't go to the doctor

Amie's step-dad Mbarek has said that he would never take another of his children to the hospital and would advise other parents to consider all their options first

He added: 'They knew what had gone wrong from day one and they didn't implement changes because it was not in their interests.

'You have incompetent staff and management that, I believe, are more focused on collecting a pay cheque than caring for people and that is a recipe for disaster.

'I'm not saying that everyone in the hospital is a rouge but it is the system that fails. The culture, the intimidation, and the lack of value for life.'

Despite being singled out for its 
abnormally high death rates, Basildon Hospital’s procedures ‘had not 
changed’, Mr Aitmarri said.

‘For us there’s no doubt that systematic failings caused Amie’s death,’ 
he added. ‘Our daughter has been treated as collateral damage.

I ask 
myself every day whether, if I had taken her to another hospital, she 
would still be alive.’

Speaking about the continued problems at the hospital, Mr Aitmarri said: 'There is no way I would take any of my other children there.

'They don't want to go to the doctor anymore. We now dread taking them to any hospital let alone Basildon.

'It is not for me to tell other people what to do with their children if they are sick but going to a hospital with such high profile problems, I would think twice and consider other options.'

Amie was admitted to Basildon Hospital in Essex after suffering headaches, vomiting and fitting

His wife Sonia, Amie’s mother, added: ‘It took until 2009 for the 
hospital to arrange a meeting and the doctors were very vague. We were 
just passed backwards and forwards.’

Amie, a promising pupil who had dreamed of becoming a paediatrician, had
 had severe headaches for seven days and had started vomiting and having
 fits. She was taken to Basildon’s A&E department on November 16, 
2008.

Dr Michel Sun Wai told the inquest he did not carry out basic tests on 
November 17, because a colleague told him Amie’s condition had improved.

'A number of changes have since been 
introduced in the treatment of children and adults with neurological 
illness, including the introduction of more regular observations.'

She died on November 19 of encephalitis, which causes swelling of the brain and is normally triggered by infection.

The doctor said: ‘With hindsight the neurological observations should 
have been done. But the handover to me was that the patient was waking 
up and was getting better.’

The inquest at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court found a string of other 
errors. Staff misinterpreted the results of a CT scan and failed to 
carry out a MRI scan, despite one being recommended.

In addition, a lumbar puncture, in which fluid is taken from the spine, may have exacerbated her condition.

Amie was also given Propofol, a sedative only meant for adults, which 
could have masked warning signs of brain damage. It is the drug linked 
to the death of pop star Michael Jackson.

Amie’s mother works as a pharmaceutical technician at Basildon Hospital,
 and her husband admitted ‘it has been hard for her to work there’.

Amie was kept on an adult ward at the hospital because of a shortage of beds at London's paediatric intensive care units

She paid tribute to her daughter, a pupil at Grays Convent High School 
in Thurrock, saying: ‘She would be 20 if she were still alive. She 
wanted to be a paediatrician and we are sure she would be at university 
now. We miss her every day.’

The family said they would pursue regulatory, disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital.

Mr Aitmarri said the tragedy had been hard on his other children as some of them had become introverted while others cried constantly.

Despite this hardship he said the family would now work with solicitors to pursue regulatory, disciplinary and criminal action against the hospital.

'To stop here is just not fair to Amie and not just to any of her family' he said.

'Our legal claim is going to hopefully highlight the failures and those responsible for taking our daughter from us.'

Tim Spring of Moore Blatch, who was the family's legal representative, said: 'Whilst we welcome today's conclusions by the jury and the specific criticisms made - we remain concerned.

'The length of time taken to establish and document a plan to prevent a re-occurrence of this type of incident was unacceptable in our view.'

Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
apologised for the blunders. A spokesman added: ‘A number of changes 
have since been introduced in the treatment of neurological illness.’

The jury returned a narrative verdict.
