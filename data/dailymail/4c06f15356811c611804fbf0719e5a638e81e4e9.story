A 32-year-old Alabama man has been charged with murder and assault in connection with a Friday night car accident that left one man dead and five injured.

Stephen ‘Rusty’ Allen was charged with murder, first-degree assault and four counts of third-degree assault, a county sheriff's department told the Tuscaloosa News.

Witnesses told police that Allen's vehicle struck a Dodge Ram truck from behind on a local parkway.

Those witnesses said they saw Allen's vehicle ‘driving erratic, in the wrong lane and going exceptionally fast,’ Tuscaloosa County Metro Homicide Unit Commander Captain Loyd Baker said.

Investigators responded to the scene of the crash around 9.30pm on Friday.

Victims were transported to DCH Regional Medical Center.

One of the passengers in the Dodge Ram, 48-year-old Anthony Naylor, died at DCH Regional Medical Center after suffering several spinal fractures.

A 16-year-old girl had minor injuries and a 37-year-old woman had a minor head injury.

A 46-year-old woman was later airlifted to UAB Hospital and the 16-month-old child was airlifted to Children’s Hospital in Birmingham.

Sheriff's Office officials said the Dodge Ram driver and his family are from Jonesboro, Arkansas, and were visiting Naylor for the University of Alabama-Western Carolina football game.

Allen was treated for injuries at DCH and released.

Baker said a search warrant was obtained for a blood sample from Allen to see if he was under the influence of any substances.

Allen was still in the Tuscaloosa County Jail as of Sunday morning. His bond was set at $110,000 officials with the sheriff's office said.
