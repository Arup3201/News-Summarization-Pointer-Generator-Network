Support: one palace fan is in no doubt who is responsible for the club's revival this season

Palace unveiled a fan mosaic with a banner that read 'Fortress Selhurst' before getting behind their team, even as they fell behind against a rampant Liverpool.

The Selhurst faithful had to endure a difficult start to the season as Palace faltered under Ian Holloway.

However, since Tony Pulis, widely considered to be competing with tonight's opposite number Brendan Rogers for the Manager of the Year award, took over, they have put together an incredible run of results, and finish the season comfortably safe.

And the fans seemed determined to celebrate that fact, refusing to let Joe Allen's 18th minute header dampen the atmosphere.
