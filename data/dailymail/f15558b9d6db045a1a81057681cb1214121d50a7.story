Football supporters don't get managers sacked on their own but they can do their bit. David Moyes should be a little nervous to learn, therefore, that a minority of those on the Stretford End have this week discussed taking down the banner that hangs there in his honour.

It won’t happen, of course. It would be a self-defeating, tasteless act and United’s hard core support has more class than that.

But as they funnel down Sir Matt Busby Way towards Old Trafford before their team’s Champions League tie with Olympiacos on Wednesday night, a growing number already feel that ‘The Chosen One’ has turned out to be ‘The Wrong One’.

Moyes bucked his own recent trend and fronted up well at his Champions League press conference yesterday, exhibiting some calm and an overdue aura of defiance.

Earlier on at the training ground, he smiled as Wayne Rooney nutmegged him, even if the horseplay involving the United manager, Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Robin van Persie did look a little staged.

'This club will rise again,' said Moyes, striking a rather dramatic tone.

Nevertheless, the mood on Manchester’s red half is dark.

United supporters not old enough to remember that Sir Alex Ferguson was three years in to his tenure when supporters endeavoured to chase him out of town after a defeat to Crystal Palace in December 1989 are already convinced of Moyes’ unsuitability.

For the first time in memory, journalists covering United have been criticised by supporters for being too 'soft' on the manager.

Meanwhile, revelations in print on Tuesday that the United board were encouraged by Old Trafford’s apparent support of Moyes towards the end of Sunday’s humbling by Liverpool were quickly countered by many who claimed the spontaneous outbreak of singing was no more than an attempt to drown out the crowing coming from the away end.

This is a remarkable time in this great football town and as cocksure neighbours Manchester City prepare to come tearing round the corner for an Old Trafford derby next Tuesday, Moyes can only hope that an unlikely Champions League comeback gives him some unexpected breathing space tonight.

'I think the support inside Old Trafford has been phenomenal,' said Moyes on Tuesday.

'I’ve told the players we need to give something back now, we need to start performing together. Me and the team.

'We need to make sure that we work together to get a performance on the night to be remembered.

'We’ll leave nothing behind on the night hopefully and we’ll try to make sure that we somehow get ourselves through to the next round.'

Asked the inevitable questions about his future, Moyes did his best to talk of the long-term, mentioning once again fundamental concepts he feels need to be changed at a club, problems previously masked by Ferguson’s individual and unique brilliance.

'My future hasn’t changed and we never discuss it,' he said. 'The biggest assurance is that the club let me get on with the job.'

It is a familiar Moyes theme and would deserve a more sympathetic audience if only his team’s football showed some sign of improving.

Sadly, the manner of Sunday’s defeat to Liverpool has done nothing to inspire any kind of optimism as United try to overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit.

United vice-captain Patrice Evra did his best to talk up his team-mates’ chances tonight but even he was left without answers when asked exactly why a team of English champions have imploded almost overnight. 

'It’s a difficult moment,' said the French defender.

It’s a new challenge for us because we have never been in this situation. But you have to show your character and personality.

'When
 you put on the United shirt you know it’s big story, a big pressure 
every year and this year is more difficult than a year ago.

'We know we had a bad game in the first leg. I think even a three-year-old Man United fan has been hurting.

'But in life you always have a second chance and we get it in this game.

'I’m still confident. We don’t want to think about Sunday, it’s gone, the past is the past.'

United
 will be without the cup-tied Juan Mata against Olympiacos a blessing 
given his recent moribund form. We can expect Danny Welbeck to fill that
 hole and one of Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young to replace the 
tired-looking Adnan Januzaj.

From bad to worse: Olympiacos take a 2-0 lead into the second leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday

What can we do? The Champions League is United's last chance of a trophy this season

Certainly an early goal would help. On
 the fourteen occasions United have fallen behind in the Barclays 
Premier League this season, they have come back to win only three times,
 a damning statistic given this team’s erstwhile reputation for 
recovery.

An early goal would give Old Trafford something to cling to as well.

Moyes may have sounded confident about his future yesterday but if performances don’t change soon then something else will.

United’s supporters will not stay classy forever. They may have more power than they think.
