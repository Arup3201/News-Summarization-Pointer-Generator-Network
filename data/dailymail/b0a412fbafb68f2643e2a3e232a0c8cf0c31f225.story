This is the nail-biting moment a 21-year-old female store clerk single-handedly fends off an armed robber almost twice her size and sends him running away.

Zara Adil, 21, was working at her parents' shop, Discount Tobacco Zone, last Friday evening when two men wearing hoodies walked in.

CCTV footage shows one of the men approaching the open register after demanding cash and throwing his handgun to one side.

Adil then grabs the weapon and tackles the thief as he shoves her against a back wall lined with liquor bottles. 

The surveillance camera then shows the man pulling the money drawer out of the register and making off with it.

However, Adil grabs on to his jacket and manages to pull the case of cash out of his hands.

The robber then runs away.

Adil told WTVQ News that she fired the gun and shot the man in the shoulder.

She apparently suffered a few minor injuries during the commotion but was determined to defend her family business.

Lexington Police reported the robbery was similar to about 15 others in the area since January.

They have issued an arrest warrant for Darnell Thomas, Jr., 30, in connection to last week's armed robbery attempt.

'If more people stand up, they won't have that much courage to go around and do what they're doing,' Adil concluded.
