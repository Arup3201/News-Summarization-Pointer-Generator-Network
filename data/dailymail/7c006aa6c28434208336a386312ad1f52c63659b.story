Perilously perched over the edge of a raised pavement, bursting through a fence and even left on top of a concrete bollard - these photographs show the hilarious, and often dangerous, parking feats attempted by some of Britain's worst drivers.

Photographs posted on social media 
channels are providing a catalogue of parking disasters on the country’s
 roads, as bemused Twitter and Instagram users shame those who struggle 
behind the steering wheel.

The pictures, which have been taken across the country, include a black Mercedes parked on a double, yellow line and on the corner of a T-junction.

Shamed: In one of many examples of poor parking posted online, this car has been left on top of a bollard (and the driver has ignored the double yellow lines)

Overhang: Perhaps this driver didn't realise the kerb would become a wall as they drove up this pavement?

Dangerous: This black Mercedes has been left across a T junction, and a double yellow line

Blurred lines: Perhaps this Golf driver did not see the lines marking out the parking spaces in this car park

In another insurance-busting picture, a motorist has attempted tor by reversing into a space filled by a hatchback, which has in turn smashed into a fence.

One picture even shows a car parked in a grass ditch, while another is of a Mercedes 4x4 straddling a raised concrete curb in a busy B&Q car park.

Another image shows two cars, a Honda and a Vauxhall, which are parked side-by-side but are so close together, they are almost touching.

The positioning of the cars would make
 it impossible for the driver to get back in the Vauxhall, let alone 
drive off without smashing their wing mirrors.

There are also plenty of drivers who have ignored the spacious white lines and parked across two spaces.

Impact: The driver of this car has reversed into this hatchback, and pushed the other vehicle into a fence

Blocked: The drivers who have parked properly in these disabled spaces will be in for a surprise when they return to find this Audi blocking their route out

Cross country: The driver of this hatchback has left the road behind, leaving the car on the edge of patch of grass, having reversed onto a pathway

Too much space: The Fiat 500's compact sizes usually makes life easier for drivers trying to fit into a tight spot - but this motorist needed two spaces to park

Another shot to be posted is of a black Vauxhall parked precariously on top of a concrete bollard.

According to the Ford Motor Company, many drivers find it increasingly difficult to park as cars have got steadily larger, while parking spaces have remained the same.

'Statistics show that as car size increases in line with safety and fashion (10-17 per cent larger than their automotive predecessors) many drivers are struggling to master the art of parking them,' said a spokesman.

'Indeed, 72 per cent of car-owning households in UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain have reported parking-related door damage – at a cost of as much as £300 per door.

'Meanwhile, the minimum measurements of a car space have remained static since 1994.'

Hanging out: This driver (left) clearly struggled with the concept of parallel parking, while this driver may not have noticed the curb when they left their car outside this Tesco supermarket (right)

Hazard: Other motorists would struggle to get around this car safely after the driver abandoned it on a kerb

Poking fun: This man could not resist poking fun at a Seat Leon driver's poor parking skills
