The search for a missing Hawaiian woman who is five months pregnant continues after her pet dog was found 20 miles from where her friends found her burned out, abandoned car Wednesday evening on the island of Maui.

Carly Scott, 26, was last seen Sunday night when she drove to mile marker 20 on the Hana Highway to pick up Steve Capobianco, her ex-boyfriend and father of her unborn child, who was stuck in Hana, near the eastern shore of the island.

Capobianco told authorities that his truck had broken down and he called his on-again off-again girlfriend to help him.

Missing: Carly Scott, 26, hasn't been seen since Sunday when she helped her ex-boyfriend fix his car

'She picked me up from my house at 8:30, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,' Capobianco said in an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now. 'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rearview the entire time.'

Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning. She never got back to him.

The following day, Tuesday, Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30 a.m. by police knocking on his door. They told him Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother.

Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test.

'The Police told me I failed,' Capobianco says. 'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.'

Burned: Scotts car was found burned out and on its side several days after her disappearance

Capobianco says he knows he is 'undeniably probably the prime suspect,' but maintains that he did nothing to harm Scott, nor does he know where she is.

On Tuesday, Scott's pit bull, Nala, was found  at the Nahiku Marketplace along the Hana Highway.

'She 
was uninjured, unmarked,' Carly's mother, Kimberly Scott, told the station, '(Nala) 
was remarkably clean.'

The following day, friends of the missing woman - 'searching on a hunch' - found Scotts car 'on its side and part of it was burned,' at the top of Jaws surf break, a popular surf spot near Capobianco's home that is made up of mostly dirt roads and is littered with abandoned cars.Â 

'Peahi is a pretty bad notorious area for people who steal cars to go and ditch them,' he says.

However, there was no sign of Scott.

'There is absolutely no reason that Charli would have taken her car out 
there alone,' her mother said 'It's a party place. Charli is five 
and a half months pregnant, as a girl you just don't go out there alone 
and Nala wasn't with her.'

Mystery: Scott's burned out car was found in a remote area near the home of her ex-boyfriend

After finding the abandoned car, Kimberly Scott says she has 'every worst nightmare running through my head' but vows to continue the search for her missing daughter.

'Don't give up looking for her. The search plan has changed, it hasn't 
stopped. She still isn't found and now we know where the car is, so now
 we have to start looking all around here,' Kimberly Scott says. 'I'm going to try to get a 
helicopter again tomorrow and start looking for her along the 
coastline.'

Anyone with information on Scott's whereabouts is asked to contact Detective Wendell Loo at (808) 270-6516 during business hours or (808) 268-2763 after hours.
