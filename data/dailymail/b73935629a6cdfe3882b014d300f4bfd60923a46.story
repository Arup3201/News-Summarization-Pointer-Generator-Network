As well as dealing with the gruelling rounds of treatment and the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis, for many of the 2.5 million sufferers, the disease's impact on appearance is often a worry, too.

Half of patients don't ask  their doctor about the possible side-effects of treatment on their physical appearance, according to research. And more than a third said this is because they didn't feel it was 'appropriate'.

In response to this, Boots UK and Macmillan Cancer Support have trained pharmacists and beauty advisers to provide additional support, from the personal to practical, to cancer patients.

They are able to offer important advice on loss of hair, eyebrows and eyelashes, dry or sensitive skin and brittle nails to help people feel more like themselves.

Charlotte Goodacre, a Boots Macmillan Beauty Adviser from Plymouth, has first-hand experience of the positive impact the role has had on a women in her local area.

She said: 'I recently helped a lady learn how to apply make up in the right way following treatment, and when she returned home her husband and son cried as they were so overwhelmed at how well she looked. 

'They came in store to thank me personally for making a difference to her self-esteem and confidence. 

'It is when you hear stories like this you realise why it is important to make sure that people affected by cancer are receiving the everyday support - no matter how big or small - that is going to make a real difference to their lives.' 

Joanne Taylor, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and had six months of chemo, a single mastectomy and 20 rounds of radiotherapy, found comfort in the beauty consultations 

If she had a down day, Joanne would treat herself to a pampering session and said she can't stress enough that feeling pretty again helped her feel so much better

Three years on, Joanne's not only in remission, left, and back to her old, energetic self, she also wants to help others going through the same experience. Pictured right with her mother Betty Cook, 83

One woman who really made use of the service was Joanne Taylor, 45, from Derbyshire. 

Joanne, a former nursery teacher, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. She had six months of chemo, a single mastectomy and 20 rounds of radiotherapy. 

But, three years on, Joanne’s not only in remission and back to her old, energetic self, she also wants to help others going through the same experience by explaining what services she experienced on the high-street.

If she was feeling low, Joanne would treat herself to a pampering session. She said: 'If I had a down day, I can’t stress enough that feeling pretty again helped me feel so much better: putting on make-up and accessories, painting my nails, pencilling in my eyebrows and experimenting with eyeshadow (as I’d lost my lashes and eyebrows).

'I went along and it was great to talk to other women in my situation about everything from skincare and make-up to hair loss. 

'I learnt all the skills from my Boots Macmillan Beauty Advisers who were really helpful and there to talk about my visible side effects of treatment and help boost my self-confidence.'

Cancer treatment can cause more than hair loss; it can affect your skin, too. Joanna Proll, a specially trained Boots Macmillan Beauty Advisor based in Chesterfield, says: ‘It’s important to find out what customers need to help them through their illness. They come in because they want to feel like themselves again.’ Here’s her advice:
