It was a performance to set a new high watermark on what you can legitimately expect from a footballer returning after one of the most brutally debilitating injuries imaginable.

Fifty-six minutes into Real Madrid’s cup tie with minnows Cornella, Sami Khedira’s accidental collision with Israel Delgado brought Los Blancos’ chunky little barrel of talent and fun, Jese Rodriguez, back to the promised land.

The concussed German exited groggily and the stocky Spaniard burst back on to the scene eight months after his own unfortunate collision with a German — Schalke’s Sead Kolasina — ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament of his right knee.

No comparison is precise but - during the previous 27 matches of the 21-year-old’s debut season, producing eight goals - there were hints of Wayne Rooney’s extraordinary blend of power and technique at a juvenile age, plus delicate flavours of the cheek, love of life and showmanship of the young Paul Gascoigne.

Whether this kid, who himself had produced a kid before he even played first-team football (little Jese), and who is already through the ‘musical differences’ break-up in the first part of his budding pop career, can reach the same eights as Gazza or Wazza remains to be seen.

He may have been missing from Saturday night’s 3-0 win at home to Celta Vigo — which saw Real equal a Spanish record 18th-straight victory in all competitions and Cristiano Ronaldo complete his 23rd treble with his 200th Spanish top-flight goal, giving him more hat-tricks than any other La Liga player — yet he has talent in abundance.

The Real Madrid fans celebrate Jese's return to action 

Which takes us back to Tuesday night and the paroxysms of joy into which the 50,000 crowd were sent by their returning prodigy.

After a missed touch here and a twinge there, he produced the ‘nutmeg’ of the European season.

Miles better than Ricardo Kishna the other weekend for Ajax.

Jese drew David Garcia to him, turned his back on the defender so that — unlike Kishna — he couldn’t even see his opponent or his stance then, ‘blind’, used the instep of his right boot to chop the ball between Garcia’s legs before running around the player to regain possession.

The Bernabeu has seen some things in its time, but the ghosts of Ronaldo, Guti, Zidane, Schuster and Fernando Redondo joined in the ooohing, aaahhing and ‘Olé-ing’ which the trick drew from the crowd.

That Jese crashed in a rightfooted goal from Isco’s assist to make the final score 5-0 wasn’t just icing on the cake.

One of the things which sets the pulse running about this buzz-bomb is that, despite the fact that technical ability and a taste for the spectacular both ooze out of his pores, he’s no show-pony.

Dedicated to winning, properly focused on elbowing his way into the Madrid first team and staying there, he’s a scamp.

There’s a bit of the Artful Dodger about him, but he plays to win rather than to dazzle.

Jese has been likened to Manchester United's Wayne Rooney

Jese has shown similarities to Paul Gascoigne in the way he plays 

Even at the age of 21, this injury has been a massively costly setback for the kid from the Canary Islands — and for the teams he’d have played for.

It cost him a Copa del Rey winners’ medal and a Champions League medal — having previously contributed to Madrid’s trajectory to the finals, he lost the pride of playing in the showpiece matches against Barcelona and Atlético Madrid.

Real, too, lost out. Their title stumble came, in sight of the tape, when just two more goals — at home to Valencia and away to Valladolid — would have given them four more points.

Enough to win the title, meaning that they would also have won their first ever Treble.

Would Jese have guaranteed those late season goals when others, older than him, were tired and creaky? Maybe not.

Was his season shaping up to write that kind of script? Yes.

So explosive was his form, socontagious his Kama Sutra of goals (scoring from four different positions, left wing, right wing, centre-forward and No 10) that, by early winter 2013, Vicente del Bosque was raising the idea of taking him to Spain’s defence of their World Cup.

There is a lot of excitement around Jese's return from injury

Might La Roja have been better off with a lad exuding burgeoning confidence, dancing past opponents and scoring outrageous goals?

Answers on a postcard. Of course, there was another cost. The mental one. Within a couple of weeks of his first operation, in Germany, a nasty infection set in and a second operation was needed.

The coach who had been most influential in Jese’s development was Alberto Toril — now sacked from his job in charge of Real Madrid Castilla.

Toril suffered this injury himself, twice, while a player and spent much of the summer helping the youngster cope with the psychological trauma it brings.

‘Knee-ligament injuries aren’t just damaging physically, but mentally, too,’ Toril noted. ‘You go through huge ups and downs, times when the healing goes quickly and times when there seems to be no prospect of advances.

Psychological strength is vital. Over the months, I’ve managed to help him keep his equilibrium.’

During those months, his house went on fire and he had to move in next door with Álvaro Arbeloa.

Also, Jese’s pop group, Big Flow, broke up. He’s now a solo artist who wants to go by the soubriquet of ‘Jey M’.

Some of his Teflon confidence comes from the fact that, in Jese’s first five seasons at the club, he won five straight leagues and became a European champion with Spain at Under-19 level.

He has the winning habit and knows what it takes to be a champion. Not all do.

Some grim days recently in Spanish football — offset and lightened by the return of a phenomenal young buck.

Someone who carries the very essence of football in his soul and in his boots.
