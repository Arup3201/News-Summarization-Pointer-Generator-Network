Hundreds of animal welfare supporters marched through Westminster today in protest at Government plans to cull thousands of badgers.

Queen guitarist Brian May and Springwatch presenter Bill Oddie led calls for the plan - hatched to stop the spread of bovine TB - to be abanoned.

A group of protesters set fire to a pile of newspapers, causing smoke to drift over the grounds of the Houses of Parliament.

There was anger in the air in Westminster and police moved in after a pile of newspapers was set on fireÂ 

They chanted 'your cull, your lies, your greed' and 'shame on Defra'. Police officers arrived after a few minutes to put the fire out.

The
cull is designed to run for six weeks in order to kill at least 70 per
cent of badgers in each area. In total about 5,000 animals will die.

Trained
marksmen will either shoot them with rifles or shotguns in fields or after they have been 
trapped in cages. Dogs on leashes will be 
used to find injured badgers but will not be allowed to drive them from 
below ground.

A government agency will carry out sample post mortem examinations to see if the badgers have been shot humanely.

If the cull is deemed a success in reducing TB infection rates, further culls will be rolled out in other areas.

The protests were made as two pilot kills in bovine TB hotspot areas in Gloucestershire Somerset were due to start.

If successful, the Government plans to
roll out culling more widely in a bid to stop the disease, which is 
spread between badgers and livestock and between cattle.

But experts, including scientists 
behind the long-term trial, have raised concerns the policy will have 
'unimpressive' results in reducing TB and suggested it does not make 
economic sense.

Mr May, a long-time supporter of the 
campaign to spare badgers from execution, said: 'The great bit of new 
information is it has now been demonstrated that the cull cannot make 
economic sense. It will lose the taxpayer money rather than save it.

'That was really the last shred of reason that you could give for this cull going ahead.

'It is a very good time for Mr Cameron to reconsider and withdraw from this monstrous cull, in the public interest.'

The protesters say there is no evidence a cull will help eradicate the spread of bovine TB to cattle and fear it will wipe out entire populations of badgers in affected areas

Mr May said the cull calls into question whether Britain really is a nation of animal lovers

The
pilot culls aim to ensure free-running badgers can be killed humanely, 
with marksmen observed by independent experts to check they are killing 
the protected animal swiftly, and post-mortem examinations carried out 
to assess speed of death.

'Bovine TB is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry. (The cull) is an important step towards taking the action we need to tackle the spread of this disease in wildlife.

'These pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease. We are using everything at our disposal to get to grips with TB including new tougher controls on moving cattle, increased herd testing and working to get effective vaccines ready as soon as possible.'

The pilots will also assess whether sufficient badgers can be killed in an area to have an effect in reducing TB in cattle, following a long-term study which found culling 70 per cent of badgers in an area could reduce the disease in herds by 16%.

The Government said the cull is 
necessary as part of efforts to stop increasing outbreaks of TB in dairy
and beef herds, which saw 28,000 cattle slaughtered in England last 
year. Without action, infection and costs would continue to soar, 
officials said.

Labour, which opposes the Government-sanctioned plan, have tabled an Opposition Day debate for Wednesday.

Mr May said: 'It would be very rude of the Government to start a cull when there is a major debate coming up.

'Our
point is to save wild animals from abuse and there is no doubt this 
cull is going to cause intense pain on a massive scale to badgers. You 
cannot call it humane, which is apparently what these pilot culls are 
about.

'It has become 
increasingly apparent to me that, although we call ourselves a nation of
animal lovers, we treat them appallingly.'

A
poll released yesterday revealed that the public is divided on the 
issue of culling, with around a third (34%) opposing the policy, and 
almost as many (29%) backing it. The remainder of those questioned did 
not know or had no strong views on a cull.

The
British Veterinary Association, which is supporting the cull, urged 
protesters not to hinder the pilot schemes, so information could be 
gathered by independent experts to assess if shooting free-running 
badgers could be done humanely.

Nigel
Gibbens, the Government's chief veterinary officer, told Sky News how 
badgers would be killed 'quickly, without causing suffering'.
