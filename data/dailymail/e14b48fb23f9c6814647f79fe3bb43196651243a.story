It is only two by two-and-a-half metres and made entirely from recycled material, but James Galletly is hopeful that someone will call his tiny project home.

The multi-purpose space - which features a single bed, a desk and storage shelves, all of which fold neatly away – was inspired by the growing tiny house movement in the United States which is slowly gaining momentum across Australia.

'We made all the furniture fold up and fold down - the backbone of tiny space designing is to make sure everything can be used for more than one thing,' Mr Galletly told Daily Mail Australia.

James Galletly plans to auction of the tiny house he built in partnership with The Bower, a recycling centre in Sydney's inner-west

The building is two metres wide by two-and-a-half metres long and will be sold on September 20

'So if you flip everything up, you have a space which can fit about four or five people.'

The tiny house, which is made from discarded materials including cupboard doors and has lighting that is run by both solar panels and an old car battery, will be auctioned off at The Bower, a recycling centre in Sydney's inner west, on September 20.

With the opening bid set between $10,000 and $15,000, Mr Galletly said he originally saw it being used as a studio or bedroom.

'I would like to see it used for a practical use on a day to day basis. I originally envisioned it to be used as an extra bedroom for a family that has outgrown their house,' Mr Galletly said.

It features a table, shelves and a single bed - all of which fold away to make room for about four or five people

Mr Galletly said he envisioned the room would be used as a bedroom by a family which had outgrown the house

'But, I've had a lot of interest from artists and writers that want to use it as their creative space.'

The builder constructed the room atop a trailer as a prototype for his next project – a fully functioning tiny home complete with a bathroom and kitchen that won't leave the owners with a hefty mortgage.

'There are more tiny houses to come just after this one sells, and next time I'll make it twice as long with the same width so we can get a kitchen, bathroom and double bed in there, 'Mr Galletly revealed.

'It's a good alternative housing model that I'd like to see pushed out into the public as viable option,' Mr Galletly said

He hopes that like the movement in the US, home-buyers will be encouraged to live in a less materialistic way while also giving a larger number of people the opportunity to have a roof over their heads.

'It's a good alternative housing model that I'd like to see pushed out into the public as viable option,' Mr Galletly said.

'I'd love to see that idea taken up in Australia. I don't see it as an option for everyone, but it definitely fills the niche for a lot of people that enjoy living in a small space and the simplicity that it has to offer.

'It can also give people who are struggling with some freedom from monetary issues.'

The tiny house movement, which discourages mass consumerism, is popular in the US and is starting to take-off in Australia
