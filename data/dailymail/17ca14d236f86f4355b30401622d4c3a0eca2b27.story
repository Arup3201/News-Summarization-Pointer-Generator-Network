A Malaysian youth leader has been slammed after he suggested the MH17 tragedy was God's punishment for the airline serving alcohol on-board.

The leader of the youth off-shoot of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, Ahmad Tarmizi Sulaiman, said the airline had provoked Allah's wrath 'in the bellies of the planes' because it mocked Islamic rule.

'In serving alcohol [which is prohibited by Islam] and the dressing of [MAS flight attendants] which cross the boundaries of Islam,' Mr Sulaiman told independent online newspaper Malaysiakini.

His comments come just six days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over the Ukraine-Russia border.

At the same time, Mr Sulaiman expressed his party's condolences for the victims of the crash and their families.

But he said the party felt that it was time the government and the airline looked at the tragedies plaguing the airline as springing from 'the element of God and his creation', and its failure to fully embrace the teachings of the Koran.

'Flying in a MAS plane does not give passengers the feeling of an airline operated by a country which organises the annual Koran recital competition and in fact, even winning the competition,' Mr Sulaiman said.

But political commentators were quick to hit back at Mr Sulaiman's comments, with some saying they were 'disgraceful'.

Malaysian Chinese Association youth deputy secretary-general Tee Hooi Ling said Mr Sulaiman's remarks were to 'gain cheap publicity from the deaths of 298 people aboard MAS Flight MH17'.

'It is disgraceful that he is insinuating that this tragedy is a punishment from God against MAS for serving alcohol and allowing its crew to wear Malaysia’s traditional costume which he deems as indecent dressing,' she said in a statement.

'Time and time again PAS has always seen women as a scapegoat to be blamed for many crimes, thus causing disrespect for womenfolk and the creation of restrictions against women rights, but to blame a woman’s uniform for what happen to Flight MH17 is pushing things too far.'
