If you have ever fancied yourself as an undercover agent, or just want to see which animals emerge in your garden at night, there’s a gadget that lets you see in the dark.

Dubbed the Snooperscope, the device transforms your smartphone into a night vision camera.

It fits over a phone’s camera lens and uses infrared light to turn the screen into a monitor that people can use to see in the dark, and can even be used as a standalone camera and tethered to a drone for aerial views at night.

The device clips over the lens of a smartphone and works with a free companion iOS and Android app. It can be used to take photographs and HD quality videos showing green scenes (illustrated) that would show up completely black using a normal smartphone camera

The website claims: ‘Snooperscope makes it easier than ever to capture your world in complete darkness like never before.’

The device is intended as a tool for wildlife watchers, fishermen and hunters, who want to better see targets in the dark.

Sports camera: Action can be captured in low lighting and darkness and footage live-streamed. The Snooperscope can also be tethered to a drone.

Wildlife photography: Gadget lets users discover a 'world under darkness' to spy on animals and record the sounds they make too.

It can take photographs and HD quality videos, stored directly to the phone, or a SD card.

‘Snooperscope delivers clear images in complete darkness and colourful images in daylight, to provide you with the ideal monitoring solution,’ the London-based company claims.

Used in daylight, it shows objects that cannot usually be seen by the human eye, according to the website.

For example, a black or red dress will show up white through the Snooperscope.

‘Some objects appear opaque in daylight, but with Snooperscope they are transparent,’ the website says.
