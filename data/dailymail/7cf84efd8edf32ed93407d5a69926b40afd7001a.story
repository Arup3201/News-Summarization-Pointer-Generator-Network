U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton may not testify on December 20, as the State Department cast a certain amount of doubt on events.

Though Clinton is scheduled to testify before the House of Representatives and Senate foreign affairs committees on a report on the deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, the said documents may not be ready in time.

The state department spokeswoman added that Clinton has not yet agreed to testify next week, but would not say whether the hearings are on Clinton's schedule.

Doubt: U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton may not testify at the Benghazi hearings scheduled for December 20, if a crucial report on the attacks is not finished

Speaking at the department’s daily press briefing, a reporter asked State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said that the Accountability Review Board is continuing to do its work and has not yet finished its report.

Nuland said: ‘The Hill has talked about a planning date on the calendar. That presumes that the ARB is finished. I don’t have any dates – any schedule of the Secretary’s to announce here.’

She concluded that Clinton testifying on the 20th is contingent on the completion of the ARB’s report.The attack on September 11 killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, and raised questions about the adequacy of security in far-flung posts.

Republicans have criticized Democratic President Obama's administration for its flawed early public explanations of the attack.

They have also criticized shifting explanations of why talking points given to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice were changed to delete a reference to al Qaeda.

Some Republicans have used that criticism to question Rice's suitability as a candidate to replace Clinton, if Obama were to nominate her.

Answers: Clinton walks with President Barack Obama to the Rose Garden of the White House the day after the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya

Clinton has said she planned to retire from her post at State after Obama's first term.

An accountability review board convened by the State Department is expected to release a report on the Benghazi attack before Clinton testifies.

The board, led by veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering, is expected to consider whether enough attention was given to potential threats and how Washington responded to security requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya.

Democratic Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement: 'We ask our diplomats and development personnel to operate in some of the most dangerous places on the planet. 

‘We owe it to them, and we owe it to the memory of Ambassador Chris Stevens and his three fellow Americans who lost their lives in Benghazi to get past the politics and focus on the substance of what happened and what it tells us about diplomatic security going forward.'
