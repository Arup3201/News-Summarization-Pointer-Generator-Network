It looks uncannily like the R2-D2 robot from the Star Wars films, but in fact this roving robot is already hard at work in a Pittsburgh hospital, zapping superbugs.

The robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), all of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments.

The $67,000 machine emits UV light to penetrate through the cell walls of bacteria and viruses and destroy their DNA, rendering them unable to reproduce.

After a hospital environmental services employee thoroughly cleans a 
room with germicidal disinfectant, a trained technician wheels the robot
 into the room, opens all the interior doors and drawers to expose 
surfaces where germs could lurk, turns on and programs the robot, and 
leaves the room.

The machine then emits the UV light to 
penetrate through the cell walls of bacteria and viruses and destroy 
their DNA, rendering them unable to reproduce.

The process can take as 
little as 15 minutes or more than an hour, depending on the size of the 
room.

It is also being tested in dozens of other hospitals across the US, including Stanford.

The newest UV robot, nicknamed 'Violet,' was recently given to UPMC Passavant by the Passavant Hospital Foundation. 

Since February, the health system has used UV robots in a pilot project at three of its other hospitals – UPMC Presbyterian, UPMC Montefiore and UPMC Shadyside – and is considering them for additional hospitals.

'Hospital-associated infections are an issue nationwide and preventing them at UPMC hospitals is a top priority.

'These robots, coupled with our many other infection prevention measures, are an important tool in ensuring patient safety. We are grateful to the Passavant Hospital Foundation for helping us to expand their use,' said Tami Minnier, chief quality officer of UPMC.

'The robot enhances the cleaning done by our employees.

The robots emit ultraviolet light that penetrates and damages bacteria, including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), all of which are commonly referred to as 'superbugs' because they are highly resistant to traditional antibiotic treatments.

Using a variety of methods, high-energy ultraviolet light in the area of the spectrum known as UV-C is produced by either mercury or xenon gas lamps.

This UV-C energy passes through the cell walls of bacteria, viruses and bacterial spores. Once the UV-C energy is inside the microorganism, it is absorbed by the DNA, RNA and proteins.

One of the primary mechanisms of damage created by UV-C is the fusing of the strands of DNA creating what is known as 'thymine dimers.'

Once the DNA is fused, the organism can no longer replicate and is, therefore, no longer infectious. The technical term for this is 'deactivation.'

'The robot does not scrub surfaces or remove dirt; it kills microscopic germs that can be missed in even the most thorough cleaning,' said Joseph Romano, M.D., UPMC infectious disease physician.

Previous peer-reviewed studies at hospitals outside the UPMC system have shown that UV robots reduce bacterial contamination in hospital rooms by as much as 95 percent and cut hospital-associated infections by more than half.

Healthcare associated infections, or superbugs, are infections acquired by patients during the course of receiving care for another condition, and can be contracted in a variety of ways.

These infections, such as MRSA and C. diff, can be devastating and even deadly, and affect approximately 1 out of every 20 patients.

In the U.S. each year, more people die from a lack of hospital infection control than from AIDS, breast cancer, and auto accidents combined, and have an estimated annual cost of $40 billion.
