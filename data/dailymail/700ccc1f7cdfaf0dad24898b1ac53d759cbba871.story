He helped bring reversing vehicle alarms to the world.

But now Chris Hanson-Abbott says so many people now find the sounds they make 'annoying' that he hopes to replace them with a less abrasive noise.

'Beep, beep, beep - people hate the sound of them,' admitted Mr Hanson-Abbott, chairman and founder of Brigade Electronics, who gave up his career in shipping in 1976 to concentrate on the devices after spotting a lorry in Japan with a rudimentary reversing alarm.

Inventor Chris Hanson-Abbott says people find the sounds vehicles make when
 they reverse 'annoying' - and has said he hopes to replace them with a 
less abrasive noise

The alarms began to become widespread in the 1980s and have helped save lives thanks to their ear-piercing 'beeps'.

But there have been mounting complaints about them.

In 2012, there was even a reversing alarm flashpoint in Colne, Lancashire, with residents at loggerheads with a local supermarket.

One commentator told the Lancashire Telegraph: '[The residents] have to go work and they are being woken up early and then can't get back to sleep.

'They go to work tired, they come home tired and then it happens all over again. It is horrendous for them.'

Yesterday Mr Hanson-Abbott told the BBC: 'The sound tonal alarms make is very annoying', but added that has always been part of the point as they are meant to be heard and not ignored.

But he said complaints about them and a growing awareness of noise pollution in general, has got him thinking about alternatives.

He hopes the beeps will one day be replaced with single tones with 'broadband' sound, which resembles the crash of an ocean wave, albeit in short, staccato bursts.

'It sounds a lot nicer,' said Mr Hanson-Abbott.

He developed the quote broadband sound in 1999 and since then around 3 million supermarket lorries have switched to it. He said: 'there are still an estimated 6 million vehicles to be changed'.
