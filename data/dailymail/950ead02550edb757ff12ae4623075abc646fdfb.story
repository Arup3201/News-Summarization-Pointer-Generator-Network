Africa Cup of Nations hosts Equatorial Guinea made it through to the semi-finals for the first time in their history but the game ended in carnage in Bata on Saturday night.

The Equato-Guineans beat Tunisia thanks in part to a controversial stoppage-time penalty, which took the game to extra-time.

Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn was then chased from the pitch by the Tunisian players after Javier Balboa had won the game for the home side, with one player aiming a kick at the official.

Eventually riot police had to intervene to usher the hapless ref down the tunnel.

As the teams left the field missiles were thrown from the crowd at the visiting players, one of whom picked up a bottle and hurled it back into the crowd.

It had been a bad-tempered game from the start, with Tunisia’s play violent and Seechurn completely unable to manage the occasion.

But for a game lacking in any flow or quality, it more than made up for it with late drama and a spine-tingling atmosphere.

With seconds of stoppage time remaining and the hosts trailing 1-0, Ivan Bolado went down under a seemingly innocuous challenge in the box. But, inexplicably, a penalty was awarded to take the game to the additional half hour.

The 40-000 fans packed into the Estadio de Bata were excitable and raucus long Seechurn pointed for the last-gasp spot kick, and when Javier Balboa stepped up to convert in from the spot it felt like they might bring the stadium down.

But that was nothing compared to the noise when the same man, once a trainee at Real Madrid, curled in a beauty of a free kick from 25 yards in extra time.

Despite the controversial decision, there was little sympathy for Tunisia, a side set up to contain rather than create, and whose energies were as much directed at kicking their opponents as the ball.

Indeed, had Seechurn not completely lost control of the game long before the equalizer, the Tunisians could have been reduced to 10 men, or even fewer.

That the game ended with a brawl including both dugouts and several players was absolutely no surprise.

Tunisia had gone ahead through Ahmed Akaichi, but the striker was one of those who was fortunate to be on the pitch when he converted Manza Mathlouthi’s cross in the 70th minute.

Akaichi had lunged, dangerously and unnecessarily, at the Equato-Guinean keeper Felipe Ovono just minutes before scoring what had looked to be the winning goal.

Aside from his goal Tunisia created next to nothing, Ovono making one serious save, and even then it was exaggerated, perhaps for the camera, or perhaps to life his own boredom.

At the other end, for all their nice interplay, the home side didn’t make too many clear-cut chances.

Middlesbrough’s Emilio Nsue might have scored when he went through on goal, only to be denied by Hamza Mathlouthi, but for the most part it was a game of high tempers rather than high-tempo football.

That mattered very little though, after Balboa’s stunning double. Like the tournament itself – moved from Morocco at the last minute - we may not have arrived at the end point in an ideal manner, but few could deny it was the right one.

But it will be overshadowed by the shameful scenes that followed, with Tunisia in particular unlikely to escape serious punishment.
