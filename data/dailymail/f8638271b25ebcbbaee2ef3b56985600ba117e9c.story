One lucky tourist is set to receive the red carpet treatment with a once-in-a-lifetime trip to London.

Celebrities including Jessie J, Downton actor Jim Carter and Professor Stephen Hawking are offering guided tours of the capital to one competition winner who will be crowned London's Guest of Honour.

The campaign is a bid to promote the British capital around the world and will include taking in a West End show, visiting Lord's Cricket Ground and even opening the city's iconic Tower Bridge.

It seems only fitting that one lucky tourist will be able to enjoy afternoon tea with Downton Abbey's Carson (actor Jim Carter) at Lord's Cricket ground

To celebrate the launch of the competition, a Guest of Honour crest was projected onto London's City Hall

Available to anyone in the UK who does not already live in London, as well as potential visitors from around the world, the competition asks entrants to submit a short film or image and in 70 words describe their perfect day in London.

The winner will then be invited for a star-studded holiday in the capital in February, with a Wimbledon tour from Tim Henman, a trip to explore Parliament with the Rt Hon John Bercow MP, and explore The Royal Ballet with Darcey Bussell.  

The unique competition, offered by VisitLondon.com and Visit Britain, is not dissimilar to Queensland's iconic Best Job in the World contest - finding a caretaker for Australia's Hamilton Island in 2009 - with Briton's Ben Southall winning the chance to spend six months on the island. 

London calling: The competition will offer tourists a chance to win unique experiences with celebrities

The once-in-a-lifetime trip will also include the chance to open the city's iconic Tower Bridge

The trip will start with London's Guest of Honour opening Tower Bridge.

Then, he or she will have the chance to see a West End musical with international pop star Jessie J and visit the Science Museum with renowned physicist Professor Stephen Hawking,

'My career began on the legendary stage of Aldwych Theatre with my first professional performance so I’m absolutely thrilled to give London’s Official Guest of Honour a personal tour of this iconic venue,' Jessie J said.

'London is packed full of extraordinary arts, music and culture.

'There’s no better place to experience the phenomenal lure of the stage than at the West End production of BEAUTIFUL – The Carole King Musical. 

'This fantastic new show tells the story of one of music’s true icons, superstar Carole King, and I can’t wait to see her inspirational songs come to life on the London stage.' 

Together, the winner and Jessie J will watch BEAUTIFUL - The Carole King Musical at the Aldwych Theatre

The visitor will also have the chance to tour the Science Museum with physicist Professor Stephen Hawking

Next up, Downton Abbey's butler Carson - also known as actor Jim Carter - will take the winner to afternoon tea at Lord's Cricket Ground, before the Speaker of the House of Commons, the Rt Hon John Bercow MP takes he or she on a behind the scenes tour of the Houses of Parliament.

'London is an inspiring city with world-class heritage, built upon thousands of years of history,' Jim Carter explained. 

'I look forward to help showcasing some of our culture to the world by accompanying the winner of this wonderful competition on a visit to Lord’s, highlighting some of our sporting history and showing them the spiritual home of cricket – a quintessential piece of London’s past, present and future.'

Likewise, Rt Hon John Bercow MP is equally as excited to show off the spectacular Houses of Parliament to a lucky guest.

'The Palace of Westminster is an iconic building recognised throughout the world as both the centre of UK democracy and a major attraction to visitors both from within the UK and abroad,' he said.

'2015 marks a special year for Parliament as we will be recognising our democratic heritage with a year-long programme commemorating 750 years since the Simon de Montfort Parliament and 800 years since the sealing of the Magna Carta.' 

A private tour of the Houses of Parliament by the Speaker of the House of Commons is also on the agenda

The winner will go behind the scenes of Parliament with Rt Hon John Bercow MP

Fancy a quick game? The special afternoon tea will take place at Lord's Cricket Ground

And no trip to the capital would be complete without a dinner at one of the city's best restaurants, so Michelin-starred chef Jason Atherton will also be on hand to personally cook a meal at his trendy eatery, Pollen Street Social.

'I’m delighted to be cooking for London’s Guest of Honour at my flagship London restaurant,' Atherton shared. 

'Pollen Street Social holds a special place in my heart as it was the first restaurant we opened. 

'I'm very proud to be a Londoner and to be representing London's culinary scene on a global stage – I hope the winner will have a great time with us.'

World-famous conductor, Plácido Domingo and British ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell are next on deck to take the winner to one of their favourite theatres in the world: the Royal Opera House.

Opera singer and conductor, Plácido Domingo, said: 'I first performed at the Royal Opera House in London in 1971 as Cavaradossi in Tosca and I am delighted to be able to show the Guest of Honour around one of my favourite Opera houses in the world and a special place for me.

'London is a city I keep returning to and it is one of the world’s great cultural capitals with its theatres, musicians and of course magnificent audiences.'

Internationally famed prima ballerina Darcey Bussell is likewise thrilled to meet the special guest.

She added: 'Having spent much of my life in London, training and dancing with The Royal Ballet, it’s my favourite city in the world for culture.

'It is my great pleasure to give a personal tour of the Royal Opera House to London's Guest of Honour. 

'The Royal Opera House is a theatre that is so close to my heart, where I have spent many thousands of hours rehearsing and performing.'

What else would make a dream trip to the Big Smoke complete, you might ask?

A chance to fire the guns from HMS Belfast, to walk the red carpet at film premiere in Central London, and a meet and greet with tennis star Tim Henman for a VIP tour of the All England Tennis Club, which hosts Wimbledon, of course.

'Wimbledon is one of the world’s great sporting venues,' Tim Henman, the former world number four professional tennis player and four-times Wimbledon semi-finalist, said.

'As someone who has enjoyed some wonderful times in this incredible arena, it will be a privilege to help the Guest of Honour experience its unique atmosphere and history.'

Tennis lovers must apply, as one stop includes a VIP tour of the All England Tennis Club with Tim Henman

The All England Tennis Club is most famous for hosting the annual Wimbledon Championships

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, also spoke about this once in a lifetime opportunity: 'London is ready to welcome our Guest of Honour in style.

'This is an incredible opportunity to immerse yourself in the greatest city in the world, in the greatest possible way and I know the winner will take home something special, something unique, something that they will never forget. 

'So post a film, enter the competition and give yourself a chance to win an experience like no other on earth.'  

The Guest of Honour will be announced in January next year and will be invited to visit the capital in early February 2015 with an accompanying guest.

They will stay in a luxury suite, the official Guest of Honour residence at Radisson Blu Edwardian, Mercer Street. 

The selected winner will have a chance to be a Keeper for the day at ZSL London Zoo in Regent's Park

They'll also get an All Access Pass to London’s fashionable Oxford Street, including  a £5,000 shopping spree
