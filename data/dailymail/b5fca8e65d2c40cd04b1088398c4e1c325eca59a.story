MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen

Teachers should be forced to sit A-level exams along with their pupils, an MP has suggested.

Andrew Bridgen wants the Conservative Party to put the proposal in its manifesto and has discussed the issue with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.

Teaching unions have previously cautioned against the move, but Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the change was a logical way to drive-up educational standards.

He said: 'My idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves, along with the students.

'After all, how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam, if they themselves could not?

'This would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly, this could be looked into and their skills improved upon.'

His comments came as it emerged that Michael Gove still plays a leading role in shaping the Government's education policy, according to the Schools Minister.

David Laws said the Conservative Chief Whip, who was moved from the Department of Education in last summer's cabinet reshuffle, joins Number 10 and the Treasury in dictating policy rather than education secretary Nicky Morgan. 

Ms Morgan has previously denied reports Mr Gove was 'back seat driving' as 'nonsense' but Mr Laws, her Liberal Democrat deputy, appeared to undermine her picture of a united front. 

He told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne.

'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.'

Last month the Labour Party said that headteachers would receive business and leadership coaching under plans aimed at raising standards and improving management of multi-million pound school budgets. 

Morgan claimed recently that teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload.

The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff.

This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.
