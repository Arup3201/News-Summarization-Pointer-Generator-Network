An Oregon couple involved in online pornography has been arrested on charges of murder by abuse after an autopsy determined their 7-week-old baby boy died of starvation.

Douglas County sheriff's deputies said Wednesday that 26-year-old Stephen Michael Williams Jr. and 21-year-old Amanda Marie Hancock were arrested Tuesday at their home in Glendale.  

A probable-cause affidavit filed by deputies says the parents told investigators they did pornography, which involved the mother self-lactating while others paid to watch online. 

The two also said they fed the baby milk but never took him to a doctor, despite signs he was losing weight.

Meet the parents: Stephen Williams Jr., 26, of Glendale, Ore., and Amanda Hancock. Williams and Hancock were arrested Tuesday at their home on charges of murder by abuse after their seven-week-old baby boy, Data Hancock, was determined to have died of starvation

'Stephen and Amanda both admitted there was no prenatal care, and they didn't go to any doctor's appointments,' the affidavit read.

According to Williams, he never called a doctor because it was Hancock's responsibility.

An ambulance was originally called on January 22 to treat an infant in distress, though efforts to revive the child were unsuccessful. 

An autopsy performed on the child revealed that he had died of starvation.

According to the affidavit, the couple showed indifference to the infant dying.

“The charging document says the couple showed extreme indifference to human life in causing Data Toria Hancock’s death by failing to provide him adequate food and medical care.”

Williams and Hancock also have a 2-year-old son together. The child has been placed in child protective services for the time being. 

The couple openly admitted that they didn’t go to any doctor appointments, and didn’t participate in any sort of prenatal care before their baby was born. 

After being arrested at their Glendale home, the couple was charged with murder by abuse. 

The couple's 2-year-old son was taken into protective custody.

A grand jury will hear the charges next week.
