US aviation officials have launched an investigation after a JetBlue passenger jet was forced to abort its take-off when another plane filled with holidaymakers suddenly crossed the runway.

After being given clearance to depart, JetBlue flight 1295 was rolling down the tarmac at full speed at New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport when a Caribbean Airlines plane crossed into its path without authorisation, said officials.

The JetBlue captain hit the brakes to avoid a collision with the Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 which had just landed from Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Guyana on Saturday night.

Jet Blue passenger Brandon Card told WABC-TV: ‘We were headed full steam down the runway and the plane came to a screeching stop.’

Passenger Krista Hollis added: ‘When they said a collision was inevitable if the pilot hadn’t braked, I said “What?”’

JetBlue spokesman Rick Clark said no one was injured.

The Caribbean Airlines flight crew were on the wrong frequency when they landed, WABC-TV reported

An FAA spokeswoman said 'the closest proximity of the two aircraft was more than 2,800 feet'

The Caribbean Airlines flight crew did not answer air traffic controllers because they were on the wrong frequency and never heard tower instructions to stop, WABC-TV reported.

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen toldNewsday that air traffic controllers immediately ordered the JetBlue crew to cancel its take-off and stop.

She said: ‘The closest proximity of the two aircraft was more than 2,800 feet.’

The Jet Blue plane, an Airbus A320, returned to the gate at about 10:30pm and took off for Austin, Texas, three hours late.
