Dr Harvey Hawley Crippen was hanged for the murder of his wife Cora in 1910; two of his prescription books which were used in evidence to convict him are to be auctioned

Two of Dr Harvey Hawley Crippen’s prescription books containing a list of posions which were used as evidence to send him to the gallows have been unearthed and are expected to fetch £5,000 at auction.

Dr Crippen is one of the most notorious killers in British history and was hanged for poisoning his wife Cora in 1910.

The homeopathic practitioner was arrested as he tried to flee the UK with his mistress Ethel Le Neve, who had disguised herself as a young boy for the journey.

The American was put to death after a trial at the Old Bailey which captivated the Edwardian public at the time.

His ledgers mainly contain worthless ‘quack’ remedies which were promoted by the notorious conman James Munyon, but they also feature prescriptions and poisons.

Crippen made a fortune peddling potions - which were usually nothing more than sugar and alcohol - to a gullible public towards the end of the 19th century.

He became Mr Munyon’s first London manager until he was sacked in 1899 - 11 years before he was hanged - for spending too much time managing his wife's stage career.

The books both bear red leather labels and say: 'The preparations log books of Munyon Remedies London, removed by warrant reviewed in the murder trial of Dr H H Crippen found guilty and duly hanged Nov 23 1910.'

They also have labels on the spine gilt which read: 'Reviewed by Dr A Winter Blyt Home Office 1910’ H.H. Crippen Albion House Evidence 1910’ and ‘Wm Long Esq Collection, London'.

Each ledger includes numerous prescriptions - with some pages containing stamps with the logo of the Home Office.

The inside covers also contain two portrait photos which are unidentified, press cuttings relating to the Crippen Case and a solicitor letter chasing a debt.

Labels on Crippen's ledgers state that the prescription books were used during his murder trial and record the date he was hanged

The ledgers contain lists of poisons and prescriptions and cover the period from 1893 to 1896

The ledgers also contain a list of the names of some of Crippen's patients

The inside covers of the ledgers contain two unidentified portrait photos, press cuttings relating to his case and a solicitors letter chasing a debt 

They both cover the period from 1893 to 1896 and include an alphabetical index and the names of patients.

The books are expected to fetch between £3,000-£5,000 when they are sold at Mullock’s Auctioneers online sale on September 2.

Richard Westwood-Brookes, historical documents expert at Mullocks, said it is believed the ledgers came from William Long, the dental mechanic who was employed by Crippen and gave evidence at his trial.

Cora Crippen's remains were found buried in the London home she shared with her husband; large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her body

Mr Westwood-Brookes said once Crippen was hanged, there was no need to keep the evidence that convicted him,

He added: 'But it is rare to say the least that primary source evidence from such a spectacular and infamous trial should come on the market.'

Crippen fled to Brussels with Le Neve, who was a young typist after his wife mysteriously disappeared in January 1910.

The couple then boarded a ferry for Canada but the ship’s Captain Henry George Kendall recognised them and notified police who arrested them when the boat docked in North America.

Crippen went on trial in October 1910 and was found guilty by a jury after just 27 minutes of deliberation. He was hanged at Pentonville Prison, London, on November 23, 1910.

Police found the remains of Crippen's wife's body buried under the brick floor of the basement of their London home after searching it for the fourth time.

Large quantities of the toxic compound hyoscine were found in her remains and the court heard Crippen had bought the drug before the murder from a local chemist.

Le Neve was acquitted of being an accessory to murder and emigrated to the U.S on the morning of Crippen’s execution.
