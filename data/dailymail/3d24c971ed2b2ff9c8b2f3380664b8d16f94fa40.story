Records tumbled across Europe on Tuesday night, as the sixteen sides in Champions League action showed little regard for defending.

Forty goals were scored, the most on an eight-game Champions League evening ever. The Stadio Olimpico offered the best value for money in terms of goals-per-minute, as Roma were thumped 7-1 at home by Pep Guardiola's imperious Bayern Munich.

That was not the only record to be broken though, so read on to find who else etched their names in Champions League folklore, and where and when the forty goals flew in...

The Bavarian giants' starting XI vs Lille on November 7, 2012:

Bayern (4-2-3-1): Neuer; Lahm, Dante, Boateng, Alaba; Schweinsteiger, Martinez; Ribery, Muller, Robben; Pizarro.

Subs used: Shaqiri, Kroos, Tymoshchuk.

Eight of the players that helped dismantle Rudi Garcia's Lille side played at the Stadio Olimpico against Roma, with Thomas Muller, Franck Ribery, Xherdan Shaqiri and Arjen Robben responsible for five of the seven goals.

DEJA-VU FOR RUDI GARCIA

Rudi Garcia must hate the sight of Bayern Munich. The Roma boss watched Pep Guardiola's side smash five past his hapless team before the break - and remarkably it wasn't the first time the Frenchman has been in that position.

Two years ago he was in the Lille technical area when Claudio Pizarro ran riot in the first half at the Allianz Arena, scoring the fifth-fastest hat-trick in Champions League history, as Bayern led 5-0 at interval, before easing off in the second half to win *just* 6-1.  

Xherdan Shaqiri set a record for the visitors as they roared t victory. The Swiss forward scored the fastest goal via a substitute this season in the Champions League, in just 71 seconds.

Arjen Robben, who played when Bayern beat Lille 6-1 in 2012, scored the opening goal at the Stadio Olimpico

BATE BATTERED BY LUIZ ADRIANO

Shakhtar racked up the biggest half-time lead in Champions League history, by putting six goals past BATE Borisov, while their striker Luiz Adriano became only the second player to score five goals in a Champions League game. 

Lionel Messi was the first, the Argentine magician achieving the feat in a 7-1 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. 

In Shakhtar's astonishing opening 45 minutes, Adriano also scored the third quickest hat-trick in Champions League history (12 minutes). The Ukrainian side went on to win 7-0.

They were 40 goals on Tuesday night in the Champions League. This is the most on a Champions League evening featuring eight games – the record is 44 set on October 1997 (12 games played).

Along with Bayern's 7-1 rout of Roma and Shakhtar's 7-0 win away to BATE Borisov, Schalke and Sporting Lisbon served up a seven-goal thriller which the Germans edged 4-3, while in the early kick-off CSKA Moscow and Manchester City played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in front of fewer than 1,000 people at the Arena Khimki.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea swept Maribor aside at Stamford Bridge, as Loic Remy and Didier Drogba both netted. Elsewhere, PSG left it late to beat APOEL Nicosia. Edinson Cavani was their hero in the absence of the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

Barcelona, who so often hog the limelight when we talk about impressive wins, were put in the shade by the night's other games. They beat Ajax 3-1 at the Nou Camp, with Lionel Messi and Neymar continuing their fine start to the season by setting one another up for first-half goals.

In the eighth game of the evening, Porto beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 thanks to a 75th-minute winner by Portugal international Ricard Quaresma.
