A family faced an appalling dilemma when their car burst into flames in the middle of Longleat safari park’s lion enclosure.

Helen Clements and her daughter, Charlie, 12, and son George, nine, were enjoying an Easter trip to the Wiltshire attraction.

Their car then set on fire and faced a life-or-death decision of whether to stay in their vehicle and risk being engulfed by the flames, or leave and face the lions who were just 100 yards away.

Mrs Clements, 43, described how her family tried to get out of the car, but rangers at the park told them to stay put for 'safety reasons'.

She said: ‘Being Good Friday it was busy and we had to keep stopping and starting the car. Everything was fine until we got into the lion enclosure.

A family were forced to flee their 4x4 after it overheated at Longleat Safari Park, Wiltshire - but they had no option but to escape into the lion enclosure. Seconds after they abandoned the vehicle it burst into flames

The mother and her two children were on a tour of the park when the 4x4 overheated and smoke started pouring from the engine.  It burst into flames in the middle of the lion enclosure – which is home to 12 lions

‘The car just stopped and started to overheat. What I thought was steam started coming from the  bonnet then it got darker and turned into smoke through the vent and towards us.

‘I knew the lions were only 100 yards away and I just didn’t know what to do – should we get out of the car or should we stay? I sounded the horn and could see some park rangers but I kept an eye on the bonnet and then I saw the flames.’

Mrs Clements, who is an assistant in her village shop in Kingswood,  Gloucestershire, continued: ‘The kids were panicking and there were a lot of tears.

‘George was in the back and opened the door and got out of  the car but a ranger shouted, “Get back in.” 

Siblings: Charlie Clements, 12, and younger brother George, 9, were in the car when it set on fire

Terrifying: Helen Clements, 43, spoke say park rangers initially told her family to stay in the vehicle for 'safety reasons'

‘I shouted back that we can’t – it’s on fire – and opened the driver’s door and started to get out and at that moment the rangers pulled up and we all jumped in with them.

‘The rangers had to keep the lions out of
 the way.

'People who saw it happening said the lions knew something was 
happening and were intrigued but fortunately didn’t come too close.

'It 
all happened so quickly it’s difficult to recall exactly what happened, 
but the children soon calmed down and they’ve now got a wonderful story 
to tell all their school chums. 

A spokesman for Longleat said the trio were transferred to a ranger's vehicle and the park was temporarily closed while firefighters extinguished the blaze

They were forced to abandon the smoking vehicle and had no option but to flee to the lion enclosure, which is home to 12 adult lions

‘It could have been a lot worse. My daughter was mainly upset that she’d left her phone in the car.’

Fire crews from Warminster put out the flames within 15 minutes. Watch manager Chris Trimby said: ‘When we arrived the car was well alight.

‘Our main concern was being able to get to the car safely while inside a lion enclosure.’ A spokesman for Longleat said: ‘On Friday  at around 1pm a car overheated in the first lion enclosure at Longleat Safari & Adventure Park.

‘The lions were cleared from the enclosure and the safari park was closed. No one was injured in any way and no lions were hurt.

‘The vehicle has been safely removed and the safari park has fully re-opened to visitors.’

The family were forced to escape into the lion enclosure after their 4x4 burst into flames while they were on a tour of the park in Wiltshire on Friday

Wayne Skinner, who was in the queue with his family waiting to get into the enclosure told Mail Online: 
'We wondered what was going on, looked across and saw at first what 
looked like steam, so we assumed that the car had just overheated.

'Then we saw the steam getting thicker and turning to smoke. That's when we realised something was wrong.

'We couldn't really tell from the distance we were, but the mother and two children looked distraught.

'The passenger door opened twice as the rangers turned up, but they told them to close the door.

'However a ranger vehicle pulled up close by very quickly and took everybody to safety.

'None
 of the surrounding cars tried to help, I suppose they were worried 
about the lions. If we had been closer, we would have tried to get them 
all into our car.

'I know it would've been breaking every rule and sign, but it's better to get people to safety first.

'We
 couldn't actually see where the lions were, the first we saw was one of
 them going to their secure holding pen to the left (behind) us, looking
 a little scared and bemused, especially the adolescent male.

'It was scary. Our children were panicking, and we didn't know if the car was going to explode and hurt people nearby.

'We felt worried for the family, with the car on fire and lions in the vicinity.'

Park rangers managed to clear all of the lions from the enclosure to ensure they were not injured in the blaze
