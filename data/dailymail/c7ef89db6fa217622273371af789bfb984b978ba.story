Arjen Robben insists there is more to come as Holland progressed to the knockout stages of the World Cup with a 100 per cent record.

The Bayern Munich winger was man of the match as substitutes Leroy Fer and Memphis Depay scored late goals to beat Chile 2-0 and ensure they and not the South Americans topped Group B.

It sets up a last-16 clash with Mexico, who finished second in Pool A.

'If you told me that we'd win our three games to finish top of the group two months ago I'd have been delighted, but I don't want to end it here. We want to go on,' he said.

'Although we want to enjoy the moment we'll soon need to start to work hard in training to improve even more.

'You have to give compliment to both teams, both gave 100 per cent - and although Chile finished second I think they go far in this tournament.'

Manager Louis van Gaal adjusted his tactics and team-shape to cope with Chile's threat and it worked perfectly.

'We limited Chile to a handful of opportunities, we neutralised them extremely effectively,' he said. 'We did have to change our style - and I will always pick a system and a strategy that will help us win.

'However, we're not perfect - in possession we still need to improve, but I do think we're very good without the ball.'

Despite that, Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli was satisfied with his side's progress so far.

'We kept going and fighting for 90 minutes, but ultimately we didn't get the result,' he said. 'I felt that our intensity and commitment was outstanding. Our players should have their heads held high as we've played well in the three games so far and we're now through to the round of 16.'
