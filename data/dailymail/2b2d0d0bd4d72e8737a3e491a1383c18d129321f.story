Freya Grace Barton entered the world in a moving car - after her mother and father got caught in traffic.

Tanya Barton, 33, was heading for Furness General Hospital, in Cumbria, with her husband Lindsay, 37, after her contractions suddenly strengthened.

However, they got stuck in traffic and, as a result, Freya was born in the front seat of father’s Ford Focus.

Mrs Barton, 33, of Morecambe Bay, Cumbria, gave birth to the healthy baby on Friday morning.

‘It is without doubt the strangest and scariest thing that has ever happened to me,’ said Mrs Barton, a mobile hairdresser who was already a mother to Mya, two.

‘One minute I was ironing clothes at home and the next I was giving birth in our car.

‘Lindsay couldn’t help me much as he was still driving, so I had to go through the birth on my own.’

Mrs Barton called her husband at work at 9am when her contractions intensified and the couple set off for hospital immediately.

But after getting stuck in traffic for 10 minutes, and with baby Freya well on her way, Mr Barton made a split-second decision to head to his brother’s home in Ulverston instead.

Freya was born in the front seat of father's Ford Focus so he stopped heading for the hospital and decided to go to his brother's house which was closer

He said: ‘A man directing traffic told us “you can’t go up that road, there has been an accident”. I told him that my wife was in the middle of giving birth and he just looked at us gobsmacked.

‘I didn’t know what else to do or where else to go. I just thought I should go to my brother’s house.’

It was while on their way there that baby Freya made her appearance.

‘Even when Tanya said “it’s coming”, in the back of your head you just think it isn’t real. It wasn’t until I saw the baby’s head that I realised it was really happening,’ said Mr Barton.

Baby Freya was born at 10.16am, weighing 4lb 11oz.

When the couple arrived at Mr Barton’s brother’s house minutes later, local residents rushed to help.

Fortunately, a health visitor and a fireman trained in first aid were both nearby and offered assistance to the family.

An ambulance was called and the trio were taken to Furness General Hospital.

As Freya was born two and a half weeks prematurely, Mrs Barton and her daughter stayed in hospital overnight so staff could make sure all was well.

The family left hospital on Saturday afternoon and have since found the funny side of their ordeal.

‘It’s definitely a story to tell the kids and grandchildren,’ said Mr Barton.
