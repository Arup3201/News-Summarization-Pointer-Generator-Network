Jack Slater was still wearing his school uniform when he jumped in to help. He has since been rewarded for his bravery

A teenager in his school uniform dived in to stop a fight which saw four security guards punched, kicked, head-butted and bitten.

Have-a-go-hero Jack Slater, 14,  did not spare a thought for his own safety until after he saved the security man from four attackers.

His actions were captured on CCTV.

Jack was with a friend at his local shopping centre when the guards moved in to remove the four men who were celebrating after one avoided a jail sentence at a court hearing earlier that day.

The fight broke out after the group were asked to leave because they were drunk and causing a nuisance.

In total four security guards faced off against the gang of four men in full view of stunned shoppers.

Dozens of adults gathered to watch the  spectacle, but only Jack jumped in to help.

During the fight one security guard had his shirt ripped off others were kicked, punched and head butted. One was even bitten.

Jack, who saw one of the four guards pinned to the ground, jumped onto the back of the assailant and pulled him away.

The incident was captured on CCTV and bosses at the mall in Maidstone, Kent, tracked Jack down to give him an award for his act of bravery.

He was given £50 in shopping vouchers during a special presentation at his school - Oakwood Park Grammar.

The teenager, from Maidstone, Kent, said today: 'The security guards were getting flung around a bit and one of them looked like he was getting overcome.

'I ran over and grabbed the shoulders of the person he was struggling with and pulled him away.

'I’ve never done anything like this before and it was only afterwards I thought, "I could’ve been hurt there".

'My friend tried to stop me and said I was stupid for getting involved but it was a spur of the moment thing.'

Paul Alcock, manager of The Mall Chequers, said: 'I couldn’t believe a young lad wanted to go and help our guys.

'There were lots of people watching what was a frightening situation but he was the only one who tried to stop it.'

The modest youngster said he would not hesitate to help out again much to his mother’s distress.

His mother Michelle Slater, 42, said: 'I told him off at the time for getting involved, but I’m very proud of him.

'He won’t do anything like that again, hopefully.'

Kent Police have launched an appeal for witnesses to the brawl.

PC Alan Weller said: 'The shopping centre was very busy and a number of people would have seen the incident.'

Anyone with any information should contact PC Weller via Kent Police.

An 18-year-old man from Bobbing and two men aged 19 and 21 from Sheerness, all Kent, were arrested on suspicion of assault in connection with the incident.
