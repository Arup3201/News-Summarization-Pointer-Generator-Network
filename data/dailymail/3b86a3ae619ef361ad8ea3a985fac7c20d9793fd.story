A distressed mother is believed to have thrown her three young children to their deaths from a high rise apartment block in Japan - before jumping herself.

Shocked passers by found the four bodies lying on the footpath in a pool of blood, sparking a police investigation into what was behind the tragedy.

Police in the city of Yachiyo, 20 miles east of Tokyo, named the mother as 35-year-old Kyoko Kozu and said her children were her eldest son, aged, seven, youngest son, two, and her six-year-old daughter.

Kyoko Kozu jumped off a high rise apartment block in Japan after she threw her two boys, ages 7 and 2, and her six-year-old daughter from a balcony

Although all four were rushed to hospital, doctors said they were already dead on arrival.

Police said that the tragedy occurred shortly before 6pm on Saturday.

The mother and her children did not live in the building but resided about a mile and a half away.

It is unknown what she was doing in the apartment block but police said they assumed that the mother had thrown the children from a balcony on the 14th floor before jumping herself.

They found a bag containing the mother's belongings on the 14th floor stairwell.

Ms Kyoko's 32-year-old husband was at work at the time, the Japan Today website reported.

Police were today questioning the husband to try to find out what might have motivated his wife to kill herself and their children.

Yachiyo has a population of about 190,000.

The Shin River, which runs near the city is said to have a major pollution problem, with chemicals such as phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen draining from vegetable farms along the length of the waterway.
