Werder Bremen defender Sebastian Proedl scored late to earn a 3-3 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Friday, ending the home side's perfect start to the season.

Leverkusen, which had won all five competitive games under new coach Roger Schmidt, opened the scoring in the 17th minute through Tin Jedvaj's powerful shot in off the crossbar but was left to rue missed chances when Fin Bartels equalized with Bremen's first real attack just before the break.

The home side had already struck the post through Gonzalo Castro and Emir Spahic, and the crossbar through Leven Oztunali.

"We should have decided the game in the first half. It should have been 5-0 and that's no exaggeration," said Schmidt, who would have made a club record start with six wins in succession.

Franco di Santo put the visitors ahead on the hour when he was left in space to finish another counterattack, three minutes before Hakan Calhanoglu equalized with a brilliant free kick.

Leverkusen substitute Son Heung-min thought he'd won the game when he restored the home side's lead in the 73rd.

But Proedl was left free at the back post to convert the equalizer with four minutes to play.

"We had the game in our grip. The Bremeners didn't know how to react. Then they score a minute before the interval. Of course it's bitter," said Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling, who missed a golden opportunity early on. "I think they also did nothing in second half. It's not the end of the world, not at all, but it does hurt a little bit."

Leverkusen begins its Champions League campaign at Monaco on Tuesday.

Bremen coach Robin Dutt was pleased with his players' determination to come from behind to earn a draw for the third Bundesliga game in a row.

"It's a clear sign of the way forward," the former Leverkusen coach said.
