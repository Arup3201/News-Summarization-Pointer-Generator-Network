A French airline is offering business-class flights for nearly £1,000 less than its competitors.

La Compagnie announced yesterday it would be selling return tickets from London to New York for as little as £1,549. 

The same business-class flight on British Airways and Virgin would cost from around £2,365.

Bob Atkinson from the TravelSupermarket website said: ‘This is a bargain. They are offering business class at Ryanair prices.

‘The trade-off for business travellers is flexibility [on dates] and the ability to move from one flight to another. But it’s great for leisure travellers wanting a business-class-style experience without the cost.’

French airline La Compagnie announced it would be selling seats on its business class-only flights between London and New York for as much as £1,000 less than its rivals

Tickets start from as little as £1,549 - with the first 500 customers getting them for even less thanks to a special offer

La Compagnie, which launched in 2013, will begin the business-class-only flights between London Luton Airport and New York on April 24.

The first 500 passengers will get the flights even cheaper – with an introductory offer of £1,007 return for two people and £649 for solo travellers.

Flights went on sale yesterday, and the airline will run four weekly flights, going up to six by the end of the year.

They aren’t the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic – Norwegian Airlines offers one-way tickets from London Gatwick to New York’s JFK from £150 but it’s not business class.

In La Compagnie’s two Boeing 757-200s, which seat up to 74, passengers can expect 26in-wide seats (66cm), compared with 17.5in in economy on most Boeing 747s.

The French airline’s seats also recline to a fully flat bed, and each passenger will have use of a personal Samsung Galaxy tablet with a 12in screen, preloaded with films, TV shows, music and books.

The flight menus have been created by renowned French chef Christophe Langrée, and – of course – champagnes and wines are on the drinks list.

Passengers will also be given an ‘amenity kit’ by French cosmetics brand Caudalie.

The cabin crew uniforms have been designed by French fashion house Vicomte A, the brand founded by party-loving aristocrat and friend of Pippa Middleton, Arthur de Soultrait. The women will wear culotte shorts while the men will have knitted ties.

There are few luggage restrictions, with passengers able to take two pieces weighing up to 32kg each for no extra cost.

However, the transatlantic route has proved a tricky one for airlines to make profitable.

Four business-class airlines – Silverjet, Eos, MAXjet and L’Avion, which was also started by La Compagnie founder Frantz Yvelin – have come and gone. 

But Mr Yvelin says La Compagnie is using more economical jets.

He added: ‘My salary is smaller than any of my captains’ salaries; our offices are in a suburb of Paris rather than an impressive address in the city centre.’
