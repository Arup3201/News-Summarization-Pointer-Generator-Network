Two deputies have been accused this week of using excessive force while arresting a suspect who was left with severe bruising and facial fractures.

Two Broward Sheriff’s officers were caught on camera punching 50-year-old David Gonzalez before throwing him to the ground at a Florida gas station. 

An internal investigation is now being conducted into the actions of the deputies, Justin Lambert and Mike Manresa, during the arrest in Deerfield Beach on February 15.

One of the officers was caught on surveillance camera in February punching the 50-year-old suspect who had allegedly stolen beer and candy from a gas station

The attack comes just months after Lambert's use of excessive force led to a $350,000 compensation payout by the Broward Sheriff's office. He allegedly 'pummeled' a party host while responding to a noise complaint.

Questions have also been raised as to why Broward Sheriff Scott Israel was not notified of the use of force until three months later.

On February 15, the officers responded to store manager Mohamad Kabir who called 911 to report that Gonzalez was drunk and had stolen candy and beer.

The deputies claimed in their arrest report that Gonzalez was cursing, 'acting belligerent' and had lunged at them.

However the surveillance camera outside 
the gas station tells a different story. One officer is seen punching 
the suspect before he is thrown to the ground, landing on his face.

Gonzalez was taken to hospital and treated for facial fractures before being charged with two counts of resisting arrest

The allegedly violent arrest which took place on February 18 only came to light this month when surveillance footage from the gas station was made public

A witness also told CBS: 'He didn’t fight back he didn’t resist or 
anything he was drunk almost unable to stand up on his own so they beat 
him up pretty bad for no reason.'

The suspect was treated in hospital for facial fractures and lacerations before being charged with two counts of resisting arrest.

Gonzalez has been arrested in the past for domestic violence and drug possession. He refused to comment on the incident but said he would be releasing a statement through his lawyer soon.

The two officers have been placed on desk duty until the investigation is completed.
