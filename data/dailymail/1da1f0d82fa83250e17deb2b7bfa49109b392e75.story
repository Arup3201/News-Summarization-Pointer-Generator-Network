A teenager found dead inside his pick-up truck in January had overdosed on heroin and did not freeze to death as first thought. 

Police investigated the possibility 19-year-old Andrew Norris died from hypothermia after his frozen body was found outside his family's Ohio home in zero-degree temperatures on January 23.

However an autopsy conducted by Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office has now revealed the teen died from a drug overdose, The News Herald reported.

Heartbreaking: An autopsy has revealed Andrew Norris, 23, died from a drug overdose in January this year

Tragic: The family of Andrew Norris (pictured right, and left with his father Russell Norris) said the teen often liked to sit in his pick-up truck to talk on the phone

Earlier this year, 19 Action News reported Norris's stepmother found his 
frigid body slumped in the front seat of his snow-covered vehicle in the driveway of their Erich Drive, Willoughby Hills home. 

Police said Norris's family had last seen him a few days before his death and believed he was staying with a friend.  

Police also said at the time there were no signs of violence, alcohol or drug activity in the 
vehicle and that it was difficult to see Norris in the car from the 
outside.

Detective Brian Jackson of Willoughby Police told the News-Herald: 'Whether he died because of the cold or not, we don’t know.'

In January, Norris's family said the teen often sat in the truck to talk with friends on his cell phone.

The
 19-year-old, affectionately known as 'Andy', worked at a local Texas 
Roadhouse diner after graduating from Willoughby South High School.

When his body was found, Ohio was in the grip of a major cold snap which shut 
down schools, facilities and government offices.

In early January, the bodies of two people were found in snow in Ohio following the brutal polar vortex.

A
 postal worker discovered the body of a 42-year-old man in his driveway,
 while a 58-year-old man was found dead on a lake after failing to 
return home.

Speculation: It was initially thought that Norris froze to death, as the temperature in Ohio plummeted to as low as zero degrees in January
