A deer hunter is fearing for his life after he killed a rare albino buck in Missouri and posted photos of its corpse on Facebook, sparking outrage across the social network.

Jerry Kinnaman himself has now become a target since slaying the animal with a bow and arrow on a friend's property in Cape Girardeau County as dawn broke on Tuesday.

'Not my biggest buck but at 7 1/2 years old he might be the oldest,' Kinnaman wrote on Facebook alongside pictures of the dead deer. 'Let the bashing begin!' 

But killing the deer, which was something of a local celebrity on account of its striking appearance, has sparked a frenzy of anger and even led to  death threats against him.

Oh deer! Jerry Kinnaman killed the animal with a bow and arrow on a friend's property in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, as dawn broke on Tuesday

'People are all tough on the computer,' he told the Washington Post, 'but it's easy for them to say that because they know they're not going to get in trouble for it.'

But he said he also understands why people are upset, adding: 'I was the same way as anybody else about this deer, so I understand the relationship some of these people have.'

However, he claimed the ageing deer was  already in a poor state of health and would have died over the next few months anyway, adding that there was 'not an ounce of fat on him'. 

And on a Facebook post yesterday, he defended his actions: 'To all of you who have negative comments I say this: I know if you do not hunt it would be hard to for you to understand why I would take this animal. I knew that before I decided to harvest this animal. I can say this to you: first, after completely cleaning this animal I can tell you he had NO FAT on him for winter. 

'He Was extremely skinny. He had Been shot before. And his teeth were almost gone. We documented all of this tonight. He would have died painfully this winter. 

'I did NOT shoot this deer to sell nor did I poach it. I contacted MO Department of Conservation right when I harvested him. All of this is documented. I will see if our Nature Center will like to display him for everyone to see when I get him back. Good night.'

Even though he killed the buck legally on land just north of Cape Girardeau's city limits, Kinnaman knew he would be pilloried for shooting it. Hunters who had the opportunity in recent years had passed it up out of affection for the beast, including Kinnaman himself.

Albinism is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes.

A condition known to affect all vertibrates, including humans, it is due to the absence or defect of tyrosinase, a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of melanin.

Experts say in deer the condition is so rare that albinos are only born once in about 100,000 births.

The animals are typically identified by their pink nose and eyes – the result of blood vessels showing through the skin and clear lens of the eyes.

Any white deer that lacks all color pigments are called 'true albinos.'    

'I had a friend who let me hunt on his land a few years ago and I asked him, `Would you be offended if I shot this deer?' and he said yes because it was so beautiful, you know?,' Kinneman told the Southeast Missourian.

But eventually, his friend changed his tune.

'He had people trespassing on his land (to see the deer) and it was getting to be too much of a hassle,' Kinnaman said. 'It got so bad that he came back to me and said, 'I want you to shoot this deer.'

Kinnaman said the deer had been shot before, surviving wounds to the shoulder.

'I gave him a fair shot. He had a good life,' Kinnaman explained. 'He's famous. He still will be.'

Kinnaman said he had the white deer on his mind as he took his bow to the woods before sunrise Tuesday. He spotted the buck on a ridge with two does and drew him closer by grunting like a rival male.

'He came up looking like a monster when I made that grunt,' he said. 'He came in ready to fight.'

The first arrow glanced off a branch and just grazed the animal. Kinnaman lured it back using a doe call and, from 25 yards away, shot an arrow into its side. The buck ran about 30 yards before collapsing and dying.

Missouri Department of Conservation deer biologist Jason Sumner said albino deer are more susceptible to predators because their white color makes them stand out.
