The judge overseeing the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez denied a request by his defense on Friday to bar police surveillance video that showed the former Patriots player using a lawyer’s phone to call one of his co-defendants the day after the killing.

The video was taken in the parking lot of the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station on June 18, 2013, the day after Odin Lloyd was killed.

Prosecutors said it shows Hernandez sitting in the car and dismantling his phone, then being given a new phone by his lawyer.

Prosecutors said Hernandez was seen using the phone and calling co-defendant Ernest Wallace.

Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said Friday that the jury will not be told where the phone came from, just that it didn’t belong to Hernandez.

On Wednesday, a second juror was dismissed in the murder trial of Hernandez. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said she had dismissed a juror for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the case.

That's the same explanation she gave to jurors last week when she dismissed another juror. The judge said that juror had discussed evidence in the case.

That female juror allegedly discussed the case outside the courtroom and attended more Patriots games than she told the court. 

Garsh started Wednesday's session by saying she received a note from a juror about an issue. The lawyers, Hernandez and then the juror were brought in to discuss the issue with the judge - though it's not clear what they talked about.

When the judge ordered the jury back into the court room, there were 16 jurors left - the one who was questioned was among them.

Garsh did not give more details Wednesday. She ended the session for the day after about two hours, citing unspecified scheduling issues.

The panel is now made up of 10 women and six men. Twelve will ultimately decide Hernandez's fate. Alternates will be selected randomly immediately before deliberations.

Hernandez is accused of the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister.

Yesterday, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée  Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify. 

The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand.

Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home.

They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. 

Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleborough mansion with their 2-year-old daughter.
