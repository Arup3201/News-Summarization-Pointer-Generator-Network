With their faces smeared black as they push rusty carts up a remote mountainous area, these images depict the grim reality of the coal miner in northern Iran.

The miners toil deep into the mountains, working in dark, narrow passageways where the risk of toxic gases and cave-ins are never far from their minds. 

Above ground, men move old metal trolleys, loaded with coal, down rusty tracks. Some shift as much as 100 tonnes a day.

International sanctions relating to the decade-long dispute over Iran's controversial nuclear programme have hindered the import of heavy machinery and modern technology in all sectors and coal mining is no exception.

This has put the squeeze on workers, who work long hours in dangerous conditions - and make just £185 a month. 

Around 1,200 miners work across ten mines in the Mazandaran province, in a mountainous area more than 80 miles northeast of Tehran, the capital of Iran.

More than 12,000 tonnes of coal is extracted from the mines each month, almost all of which is shipped south for use in Iran's steel industry.

Iran's ministry of industry, mines and commerce has said it has plans for improving the working conditions of miners alongside a drive to increase the production of minerals. 

Deputy Minister Jafar Sargheini has said the ministry will grant loans and aid as part of the four-year plan for the sector, which will include safety improvements.
