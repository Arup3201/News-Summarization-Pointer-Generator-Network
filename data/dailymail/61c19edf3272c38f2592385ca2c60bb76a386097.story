The cancer-stricken father of a comedian who live-tweeted his final days in a hospice, died today.

Laurie Kilmartin has been providing her growing number of Twitter followers with heartbreakingly funny updates on her 83-year-old dad's deteriorating condition.

Korean War veteran Ron Kilmartin was admitted into a hospice facility on February 20, following six rounds of chemotherapy and a week of radiation treatment.

But in a devastating blow, the deeply-loved patriarch lost his battle against lung cancer today, with his grieving daughter tweeting to her 42,000 followers: 'Hey all, Dad passed away about an hour ago. Thanks for all your messages, he was bowled over that so many strangers were thinking of him.'

Kilmartin, a staff writer on 'Conan'
 best known for being a finalist on season seven of Last Comic Standing, has
 been sharing with the world her experience of watching her father deteriorate.

Her tweets range from deeply sarcastic to wistful and to genuinely sweet. 

But it wasn't until Wednesday that the Emmy-nominated satirist's live-tweeting went viral.

'Losing Dad, gaining followers. The Lord truly works in mysterious ways,’ the comic wrote to her 14,900 fans at the time.

Today, she thanked her thousands of followers for their support and shared several more moving comments following her father's death.

'After Dad took his last breath, I looked up. Either I gave Dad's soul a final heartfelt message, or the ceiling now thinks that I love it,' she wrote.

It wasn't long before she joked about the various grieving rites of passage.

Do' I correct the friend who wrote "condolences on loosing your father" ?' she wrote.

While many of her followers, including 
actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, have embraced Kilmartin's unique 
approach to dealing with loss, others have criticized her for making 
light of her father’s impending death.

In a tongue-in-cheek post, Kilmartin explained to her detractors what her ultimate goal is.

'Guys, I'm just trying to grieve in advance, so I can relax and have fun at the funeral,' she wrote.

It was Oswalt, a star of 'Young Adult' best known for his voiceover in Pixar's 'Ratatouille,' who put  Kilmartin's live-tweeting exercise on the map when he described it as 'epic' to his 1.6million followers on Wednesday.

User Bill Jensen raved: ‘If @anylaurie16 doesn't win a Pulitzer for her father's-deathbed tweets, the whole award system is a sham.’

The 140-character messages have allowed an unflinching look into Kilmartin's relationship with her octogenarian dad, including their political differences: Mr Kilmartin was a conservative and a big fan of Glenn Beck, while his daughter is a liberal.

'Dad just let me turn on MSNBC during a Fox News commercial break. Time for Last Rites,' Miss Kilmartin recently quipped.

Over the last two weeks, Mr Kilmartin was being cared for by his wife of 55 years, Laurie Kilmartin and another daughter, who is a doctor.

Laurie
 Kilmartin also took her seven-year-old son to the hospice to 
spend time with his grandpa, and the boy has offered his own take on the
 situation.

'I said, "Grandpa's dying," and my 7 yo 
son looked up at me with his big brown chocolate drop eyes and said, 
"what about his iPad?"’ the comic tweeted.

In the hours before her dad's death, Kilmartin took to social media with brutally honest but funny accounts.

'I want to be here for his last breath, but I really have to pee. #deathbedProblems,' she tweeted, just two hours before her dad died.

About a day before, she joked: 'Seriously my boyfriend picked the worst weekend to meet my parents.'

Kilmartin is not the first to live-tweet the passing of a parent.

As Daily Dot reported, NPR’s Scott Simon famously gave regular updates on Twitter describing his mother's final days in 2013.
