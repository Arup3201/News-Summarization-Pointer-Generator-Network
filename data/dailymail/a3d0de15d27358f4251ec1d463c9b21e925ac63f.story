A lawyer representing a woman who has accused Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting when she was 15 has stated in a court filing that he has interviewed two witnesses who corroborate her story.

Attorney Marc Strecker wrote in a sworn declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday that he has reviewed photographs of his client, Judy Huth, with Cosby at the Playboy Mansion in the mid-1970s, the place and time she says the abuse happened.

Huth's sexual battery lawsuit against Cosby comes amid an avalanche of allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted more than two dozen women.

He has never been charged in connection with any of the accusations, and his lawyers deny many of the allegations. 

He reached a settlement with a Pennsylvania woman who in a 2005 lawsuit said Cosby drugged and molested her in 2004.

Cosby's attorney Martin Singer is seeking to dismiss Huth's suit and has called it an extortion attempt. 

He says Huth, now 55 years old, tried to sell her story to a tabloid a decade ago and contends that undercuts her claim of recently discovered psychological damage.

Strecker's declaration does not provide details about how the witnesses corroborate Huth's story, but her lawsuit states she and a 16-year-old female friend were taken to the Playboy Mansion by Cosby sometime around 1974. 

The lawsuit alleges that they met him at a film shoot, and he later gave them alcohol while they played pool, before he took them to the mansion.

Strecker's filing also includes a declaration from Dr. Anthony E. Reading, a clinical psychologist who interviewed Huth and stated there is 'a reasonable basis to believe that Ms. Huth has been subject to childhood sexual abuse.' Reading's statement does not mention Cosby. 

Many of the allegations against Cosby are blocked from court by statutes of limitations, but Los Angeles police are investigating Huth's claims.

She appeared at a news conference December 5 with attorney Gloria Allred, who held up decades-old photographs of Huth with Cosby. Allred wrote in an email Monday that the photos were taken at the Playboy Mansion.

Judy Huth is among two dozen women who have come forward in recent weeks accusing the 77-year-old married comedian of drugging and raping them over the course of five decades.

Cosby has not commented on the accusations, but his wife and the mother of his five children, Camille Cosby, released a statement Monday staunchly defending her husband and proclaiming him the real victim of the scandal.

‘He is a kind man, a generous man, a funny man, and a wonderful husband, father and friend,’ Camille Cosby said in the 210-word statement released by Cosby's publicist. ‘He is the man you thought you knew.’

Mrs Cosby, who married the trailblazing comic in 1964, called her husband ‘the man you all knew through his work’ and excoriated the news media for not vetting her husband's accusers.

‘None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim,’ Camille Cosby continued. ‘But the question should be asked - who is the victim?’

The previous day, Cosby gave a brief interview with the New York Post, disparaging the media and praising his wife for giving him 'strength and love.'
