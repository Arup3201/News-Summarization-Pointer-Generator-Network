This is the moment a Premier League star was arrested for drunkenly assaulting a police officer hours after playing Manchester United.

West Ham defender, James Tomkins, 25, pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly outside the Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood, Essex.

He also admitted assaulting and obstructing a police constable during the incident on December 21 and was fined £3,500 when he appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today.

James Tomkins, West Ham defender, is arrested by police for being drunk and disorderly in Brentwood, Essex

Officers escort him to the police car, where he  injured an officer. He was fined £3,500 for the assault 

The footballer had been partying at the hotspot made famous by the ITV2 series The Only Way Is Essex hours after his club’s 3 – 1 defeat at Old Trafford.

The court heard that Tomkins had been pushed hard by a member of staff but he admitted ‘over-reacting’.

Martin Everett, chair of the bench at Southend Magistrates’ Court, told him that in the police car he dealt with the situation ‘inappropriately causing an injury to the police officer’.

He added that ‘this is a blot on your character’ and he had ‘no doubt that West Ham will take their own action’ to punish him.

Mr Everett told him: ‘It is a late guilty plea but it has saved the court a trial and witnesses’.

James Tomkins was spotted playing for his local Sunday League side at the age of seven and was signed to West Ham United’s youth academy.

He started out his football career as a striker before switching to his current position in central defence.

He has represented England internationally at U15, U16, U17, U19 and U21 levels and played every match of the 2008 UEFA U19 Championships.

Tomkins made his Premier League debut on March 22, 2008 in a 1-1 draw away to Everton.

In November 2008 he was signed to Derby County on a five week loan before he was recalled to West Ham on December 31.

He played for Great Britain twice in the 2012 Olympics – in matches against Brazil and UAE. 

Rupert Bowers, defending, told the court that as a footballer he gets ‘a lot of attention - much of it unwanted’.

He said: ‘They receive training and receive guidance from the Football Association. Mr Tomkins accepts that on this occasion he let himself down.

‘He has been extremely stressed about these proceedings, about his reputation and the coverage it has had.’

He also described Tomkins, who stood quietly in the dock during sentencing, as a ‘young man of previous good character [who is] usually looked up to.’

Tomkins, who was a former England Under-21 international and appeared for Team GB at the 2012 Olympics, was ordered to pay £3,785 court costs, £200 compensation to the police officer and a £120 victim surcharge.

He was told he would face no further charges and left the court and into a waiting car without comment.

MailOnline made contact with West Ham United which has refused to comment on the matter.
