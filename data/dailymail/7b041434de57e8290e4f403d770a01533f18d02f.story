Father's day is just around the corner but if you are thinking of getting your Dad a tool to do some DIY around the home - you might want to think again.

Each year, at least 4 people - mainly men - die due to ladder injuries with 1,300 people are injured.  While at least 46 Australians were crushed and killed while working under a vehicle in the decade to 2011.

NSW Fair Trading work are running a national 'Don't be a Tool' campaign, to combat the number of injuries that result from home DIY projects. 

But ladders are the least of your worries according to NSW Fair Trading Minister, Matthew Mason-Cox, who is urging do-it-yourself (DIY) enthusiast to 'take extra care' while doing work around the home.

'DIY gadgets are popular purchases for Father's day and many dads, me included, will be tempted to try out the new gadgets and do maintenance and improvements around the home,' Mr Mason-Cox said.

'The reality is that simple DIY jobs like pruning, cleaning out gutters and painting a ceiling can end in disaster,' said Mr Mason-Cox.

He advises people who attempt to fix their car to never work under it, saying each year '160 people experience fracture and crush injuries' due to car jacks.

Mr Mason-Cox suggests planning your home project in advance, to assess what skills  and equipment are required to complete the project safely, and to not be afraid to pass the job on to an expert.

Dr Tim Health, Head of Hand Surgery Unit at Sydney Hospital said injuries from a circular saw and angle grinders are common

Superintendent for Queensland Ambulance Service Sean Mutchmor has seen plenty of DIY victims and told Daily Mail Australia that Father's day weekend is a lot like any other long weekend where people need to be more conscious of safety.

'It's one of those things where a father and son build a deck - when it is a holiday and frosty beverages, alcohol and power tools are involved, it becomes dangerous. 

'We have to remind people to take on the project safely,' he said. 'A lot of people are too relaxed.' 

'Projects can be fun of course but you just need to remember to be conscious.' 

'Most of the injuries we see are related to power tools, people who aren't professionals, sawing their fingers off or lacerations,' Superintendent Mutchmore said. 

James Golfin, 35, an experience tradesman, knows the effects of a DIY injury all too well, after accidentally slicing off his pinky finger with a circular saw, while finishing off a day-bed he had built for his partner's family home in Bondi Beach, Sydney.

'I wasn't in any pain, it all just happened so quickly,' Mr Golfin told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Golfin was rushed to hospital for nine and a half hours of micro surgery on his right hand. He severed nerves, tendons and arteries to four of his fingers and lost his pinky finger

'When you see your bones exposed and the flesh smashed to smithereens it is pretty gruesome, but I said, 'Look, just save what you can', I thought I'd lose the majority of them.'

He says this incident is very common among do-it-yourself enthusiasts and suggests there should be restrictions on 'any joe-blow' buying those type of tools.

'I would have used that power saw a thousand times but sometimes they just don't recoil back and you take your mind off it for one second and then you are in trouble.'  

Dr Tim Health, Head of the Hand Surgery Unit at Sydney Hospital, said he has experienced an increase in home injuries, that become a significant problem when they involve the home and 'potentially deadly weapons.' 

'Injuries from the use of circular saws and angle grinders are common and so are injuries suffered by people modifying tools and using them as they are not intended,' said Dr Health.
