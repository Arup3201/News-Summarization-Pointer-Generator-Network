The Brazilian tycoon who bankrolled the bid to bring the 2016 Olympics to his home country has boasted how he will soon be the world's richest man.

Eike Batista, ex-husband of stunning Playboy cover girl Luma de Oliveira, said he would overtake Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim in the 'next three or four years'.

The 55-year-old serial entrepreneur, who has created a $30billion fortune from scratch in just 30 years, said by 2015 he will be making a staggering $10billion per year.

This, he claimed, would propel him 
clearly in front of Slim's $68.5billion, Microsoft honcho Bill Gates's 
$62.4billion and Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett's $43.8billion.

'I'm not bragging. It's just a 
consequence of all the things that we have done. Just look at the 
assets. Jesus, by 2015 we will be making $10billion.

'Between
2015 and 2020 that will double, or triple. And those are discounted 
numbers I'm giving you,' South America's richest man told the Sunday 
Times.

With
a McLaren F1 Mercedes in his plush Rio de Janeiro apartment living room
and a steely determination that saw him twice become world powerboat 
racing champion, it seems they are not idle boasts.

His influence over Brazil overtaking 
Britain to become the world's sixth largest economy is also not to be 
laughed at. The tale of the world's seventh richest man is not a true 
one of rags to riches.

His father was a famous Brazilian 
engineer, who became president of nationalised mining giant Vale, and 
who sent his seven children to a private international school in 
Brussels.

His monthly allowance did not cover all 
his expenses, and so he started selling insurance door-to-door in the 
evenings, something he continued to do as he studied engineering at 
Aachen in Germany.

After dropping out of college just two
years into his course, in 1980 he started to act as an agent between 
diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium, and Amazon miners.

He then started flying to the jungle, buying gold direct from the miners and selling it on. This led to him buying his own mine, the 
Novo Planeta, which later became the first mechanised one in the 
country. Another eight followed across the continent.

Eike Batista has built up a $30billion fortune from scratch over 30 years.

He is the richest man in South America - the seventh wealthiest in the world.

His EBX Group has assets he claims are worth $1.5trillion.

$300billion of high-grade coal in Colombia

He made $1billion for himself, and $20billion for investors, before the capital markets opened up for Brazilian companies in 2000.

His EBX Group is now, he claims, worth $1.5trillion.

His mining assets include $300billion of high-grade coal in Colombia, $200billion of iron-ore in the inland province of Minas Gerais and a gold mine he bought for $1.5billion two years ago is now worth four times as much.

The oil firm he created off the Rio coast less than five years ago is said to have has reserves of $1trillion and his power company generates 14,000 megawatts per year.

He is also building the world's third biggest $50billion airport north of Rio - creating 50,000 jobs. His new Acu superport, which will also be the third largest globally, will also boost the area surrounding Rio.

Once he has enough cashflow, which should be in two years time, he said he then wants to 'change my country'.

He said: 'I want to construct new departments in universities, modernise them. And great hospitals. Help educate Brazilians. I have learnt to build cathedrals.'

But the ex-husband of de Oliveira, whom he divorced in 2004 after 13 years of marriage, also revealed he had no desire to become a politician, adding that: 'This is not Russia, where eventually they take it away from you.'

Batista's boast comes in the same month that Brazil's economy overtook Britain's for the first time.   The South American nation became the seventh largest in the world, figures revealed earlier this month. Brazil's total output last year was worth £1.56trillion - compared with £1.53trillion in Britain, think-tank Cebr said.

The UK economy grew by just 0.8 per cent last year and contracted by 0.2 per cent in the final quarter, leaving the country on the verge of a double-dip recession. In contrast, economic output rose by 2.7 per cent in Brazil, which has a population of around 200million.

Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at Cebr, said: 'It's a natural enough movement. Brazil has a large population, has massive natural resources and strong local industry.

'It's just a country set for higher growth.' Britain fell one place to seventh in the world economic rankings while Brazil closed the gap on France and Germany.
