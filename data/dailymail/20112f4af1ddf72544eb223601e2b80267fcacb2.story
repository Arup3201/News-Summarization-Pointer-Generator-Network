As Ecuador harbours Julian Assange at its London embassy, Britain is continuing to send the Latin American nation foreign aid handouts.

Assange gave an Evita-style speech from the balcony of the embassy on Sunday which was a deliberate taunt to British justice.

His self-imposed exile is costing British taxpayers up to £50,000 a day in policing costs as scores of officers lay siege to the building.

Taunting British justice: Assange gave his speech from the Ecuadorian Embassy balcony on Sunday as more than 100 police watched on, powerless to arrest him because he did not leave the building

Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday faced demands to stop Britain’s aid programme in Ecuador in protest at its support for the WikiLeaks fugitive.

Britain funded more than £3.3million in aid to Ecuador in the ten years up to 2010, and continues to give around £60,000 a year.

Yesterday more than 20 uniformed police were stationed outside the embassy in Knightsbridge, despite only a handful of protesters remaining. With shift changes that means at least 60 officers a day are sucked into the stalemate.

On Sunday more than 100 were drafted in to police Assange’s balcony speech, but were powerless to arrest him because he did not leave the building.

The WikiLeaks founder is wanted in Sweden to face rape and sexual assault charges, and Britain’s Supreme Court has ruled he should be extradited.

But the 41-year-old Australian broke his bail conditions to claim asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in June and has remained inside the mansion block for more than two months.

Protest: Ecuador's president Rafael Correa has accused Britain of threatening to storm its embassy

Britain has vowed to arrest him if he steps outside but cannot send police into the embassy under the terms of the Vienna Convention.

Dozens of officers have surrounded the building for days to ensure he is not smuggled out and the Foreign Secretary has made it clear he will not be allowed safe passage out of the country. The impasse has left Britain in a diplomatic stand-off with Ecuador, which has won support across South America.

At a meeting of the Union of South 
American Nations yesterday, foreign  ministers issued a statement which 
‘condemned the threat of the use of force between states’ and reiterated
 ‘the right of states to concede asylum’.

Ecuador’s
 president Rafael Correa has accused Britain of threatening to storm its
 embassy after the Foreign Office said it could rescind the building’s 
diplomatic protection.

Between 2000 and 2010 the UK gave more than 
£3.3million to Ecuador to pay for ‘climate change awareness, 
environmental protection, children and human rights, gender, democracy 
and good governance issues’.

Douglas
 Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘We spend a lot of money on aid 
abroad trying to buy friends. But surely we should have learned that the
 more you pay people, the more they despise you.

Britain’s aid budget has become totally detached from the priorities of taxpayers, whose money it is.

Crowded: Hundreds of supporters, journalists and police officers filled the Knightsbridge street to listen to Assange speak

Granted asylum: Ecuador gave Assange asylum because Britain and Sweden refused to guarantee they would not extradite him to the US where he could face life in prison or death over leaked diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks

‘Pensioners in my constituency will struggle to heat their homes this winter. What officials decide to spend money to raise awareness of climate change in Ecuador, when my constituents cannot keep themselves warm in winter?’ 

Ecuador said it granted asylum to Assange because neither Britain nor Sweden would guarantee that they would not extradite him to the US.

The former computer hacker enraged Washington in 2010 when WikiLeaks published 251,287 leaked diplomatic cables.

His supporters fear he has been secretly indicted by a grand jury in America and that he could face life in prison or even the death penalty.

However the Obama administration yesterday accused Assange of making ‘wild assertions’ about US persecution to deflect attention from the Swedish sex allegations. 

In Downing Street, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘Under our law, having exhausted all the options of appeal, we are obliged to extradite him to Sweden. It is our intention to carry out that obligation.’
