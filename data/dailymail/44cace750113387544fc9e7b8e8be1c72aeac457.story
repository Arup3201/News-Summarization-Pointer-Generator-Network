Creating a 'perfect life' for yourself on Facebook can help boost self esteem, a study has found

Creating a 'perfect life' for yourself on Facebook can help boost self esteem, a study has found.

But researchers have warned there could be a downside to the rush of good feeling which comes from looking at your 'idealised' profile - as it can make users less motivated to do well in other areas of their lives. 

Scientists from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, tested the self esteem of users of the social networking site after they viewed their own profile for five minutes.

They asked volunteers to associate positive or negative adjectives with words like 'me', 'my', and 'I'.

Study researcher Catalina Toma said the test group experienced a significant 
boost in self-esteem after looking at their own Facebook profile 
for just five minutes, Today Tech reports.

She said: 'If you have high self-esteem, then you can very quickly associate words related to yourself with positive evaluations but have a difficult time associating words related to yourself with negative evaluations.

'But if you have low self-esteem, the opposite is true.'

But she and the team noted that this self esteem burst seemed to make the group less likely to perform well when faced with a maths test immediately after.

They discovered those who had viewed their Facebook profiles before the test answered fewer questions in the designated time than compared with a control group who had not been looking at their profiles.

Ms Toma said that performing well in a task can help people to feel better about themselves, but when people are already feeling full of self worth, they may be less likely to need to 'increase the feeling' by performing well in a task.

She added that further research is needed to examine the psychological effects of other Facebook activities, like viewing other users' profiles or reading their newsfeeds.

Previous studies have claimed that scrolling through other people's Facebook accounts can leave people feeling depressed about their own lives. 

The research is published in the June issue of the journal Media Psychology.
