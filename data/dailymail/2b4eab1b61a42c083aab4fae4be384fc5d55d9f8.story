Gerard Pique has apologised after a furious confrontation with police in Barcelona.

The Spain star was in the Port Olimpic area of the city after he had flown back from  international duty, when his brother stopped their car in a bus zone for 15 minutes.

Police said that they had been obstructing taxis and other vehicles and issued Pique's brother, Marc, with a fine.

Pique later apologised for the incident after calling the officers 'a disgrace' and claiming they envied him

This was when Pique, 27, is said to have exploded and ranted at the officers.

He got out of his car and said, according to La Vanguardia: 'You envy me because I'm famous. You are fining me because you're on commission, because you have no money and you need to make commission.

'I'm going to speak with your bosses and get you reprimanded. You think you are masters of the world because you wear that uniform and fine people.

'Your father's going to pay this fine - I'm not. You are a disgrace. Your profession makes me sick and the Guardia Urbana is a f****** disgrace.'

Pique then allegedly snatched the fine out of his brother's hands and flung it back at police, before the pair entered Casino Barcelona.

Pique took to Twitter to apologise, saying the incident 'has been exaggerated' it 'will not happen again'

The central defender apologised on Wednesday night for what he had done, although he claimed that the press had exaggerated his comments.

'What I said has been exaggerated a lot, but in any case, I am sorry, I made a mistake and it will not happen again,' he tweeted.

Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba was quick to jump to his team-mate's defence, saying: 'The club has nothing to say. It would be bull*** if Barça punished Pique. Besides, he has already said sorry. We all make mistakes.'

Some believe Pique's apology even has an element of sarcasm to it because he used the exact wording that former King of Spain Juan Carlos did after he was caught elephant hunting in Africa in 2012.

Pique is almost certain to be fined by Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, who has implemented a strict code of behaviour at the club since joining in the summer.
