They were the band who played on as the Titanic began to sink, but their instruments were thought to be long lost at the bottom of the ocean.

Experts now believe, however, they have now discovered the violin belonging to heroic Titanic band master Wallace Hartley.

Tests are taking place to establish whether the violin did belong to Mr Hartley, who perished along with the rest of his eight-man band when the doomed ship went down.

The band leader was said to have been found with his violin strapped to his chest after the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912.

But there was no mention of the instrument in records of his effects, and its whereabouts had remained a mystery ever since.

The person claiming to own the violin lives in the UK, but is not a relative of Mr Hartley.

The owner said the band master's fiancee, Maria Robinson, was given the instrument after the Titanic tragedy 100 years ago.

If it was put up for sale it would smash the record for a Titanic artifact, currently set by the post office keys which went for £101,000 in 2007.

All eight members of the band that gallantly played as passengers lined up for evacuation to the life-boats perished in the disaster but the bodies of the band leader and two other musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the CS Mackay-Bennett and taken to Nova Scotia, Canada.

Violinist John Law Hume from Dumfries in Scotland and bass player John Frederick Preston Clarke from Liverpool were laid to rest in Halifax but Hartley’s body was repatriated to England and buried at Colne, Lancashire, the town where he was born and raised.

Newspapers at the time reported that Hartley was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest.

However, when the effects of Body 224 were itemised by The Office of the Provincial Secretary in Nova Scotia there was no mention of it.

Other than his clothes and spare change he had only a ring, a pen, a silver matchbox, a gold cigar holder, a watch and chain, a collar stud, a pair of scissors and two pieces of correspondence.

It was not among the possessions handed back to his father Albion Hartley who collected the body from the Arabic at Liverpool docks. The assumption has long been that the instrument was spirited away by someone involved in collecting the corpses.

Wallace Hartley had become engaged around 1910 to a girl named Maria Robinson. She was left bereft by her fiancis death, moved to the Yorkshire seaside resort of Bridlington, and never married.

She died alone in 1939. The unnamed person who now owns the violin claims that Robinson retrieved the violin after Hartley’s death.

Among the supporting evidence is a 1912 diary where she has apparently drafted a letter to the authorities in Nova Scotia thanking them for acceding to her wish to have the violin sent to her.

The draft letter in Maria Robinson’s diary reads: 'I would be most grateful if you could convey my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of my late fiance’s violin.

'May I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you personally for your gracious intervention on my behalf.'

The violin itself was stored in a brown leather case with the initials W.H.H stamped on it and an inscription on the tail piece reading: ‘For Wallace on the occasion of our engagement from Maria.’

Now the instrument believed to be Hartley’s is currently being handled by leading Titanic memorabilia auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son.

The Devizes-based firm hold every record set for items from the ship and are considered the world’s leading authority on its artifacts.

They have so far spent thousands of pounds seeking to establish beyond any doubt that the violin is the genuine article.

Mr Henry Aldridge said today: 'We are waiting the results of further laboratory tests. When I first saw it five years ago I was amazed. If I did not think that the probability was there I would not have bothered.

'The research is expensive business but because of the historical importance of this item the money is secondary.

'The owner has not made up their mind if they would want to sell it but I think it is more likely it will go on exhibition - if it is proved to be genuine.

'We hope to have a definite answer sometime this year. We cannot rush the scientists.'
