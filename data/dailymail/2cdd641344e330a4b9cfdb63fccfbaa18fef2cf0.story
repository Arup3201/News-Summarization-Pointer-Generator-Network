Thug: Timothy Hagar, 26, who has been jailed for six-and-a-half years at Teesside Crown Court after viciously attacking dad Sean Cole outside his home in Loftus, East Cleveland

A father was beaten up so badly by a thug after asking a drunken gang to move away from his home that he had to quit his job because of his injuries.

Timothy Hagar attacked oil worker Sean Cole and stamped on his head with 'full force' as he lay unconscious outside his home in Loftus, North Yorkshire, in April last year.

He kicked Mr Cole so hard that he had blood splatters on his right trainer and a piece of flesh embedded in the heel following the attack.

He was too ill to work and had to give up his £4,000-a-month job.

Mr Cole was so badly injured that his five-year-old daughter did not recognise him when he was released from hospital.

Hagar, 26, was jailed for six-and-a-half years yesterday after admitting inflicting grevious bodily harm with intent at Teeside Crown Court.

The court heard that offshore worker Mr Cole had stepped outside his home with his wife Louise and asked the group, which included Hagar, to move away from the house.

But Hagar kicked the couple's dog in the head and then subjected Mr Cole to an 'appalling' attack, knocking him unconscious and kicking him in the head and chest.

Mrs Cole feared that her 43-year-old husband was dead as she rushed to his aid and screamed for help as he lay motionless on the ground.

He suffered a double jaw fracture and lost teeth in the attack, and still suffers from numbness down one side of his face, according to prosecutor David Crook.

Mr Cole was so ill that he was forced to give up his job and moved his family to Scotland.

But the family has since hit financial trouble and have been served with an eviction notice.

In a victim statement read out to the court, Mr Cole said: 'I will never forgive the man for what he did.

'My own wife thought I was dead. She witnessed the attack.

'One thing that still upsets me is that the day I was released from hospital, I saw my children and tried to cuddle them.

'My five-year-old daughter got scared and ran off. She did not believe I was her father because I didn’t look like him.'

Hagar, a binge-drinking supermarket warehouse worker, was so drunk he could not remember the attack, but was said to be ashamed of his actions.

When his mother saw the aftermath of the trouble, she said: 'If it’s my son who’s responsible, I’ll disown him', the court was told.

Paul Newcombe, defending Hagar, said: 'He is at a loss to explain his behaviour. All he can venture is that he drank an enormous amount.'

In a letter of apology to his victim, Hagar, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, said: 'I am sincerely sorry for what happened to you, and I am completely and utterly ashamed of myself.'

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told Hagar he had ruined Mr Cole’s life through 'seconds of gratuitous, mindless violence'.

After Hagar was sentenced, Detective Constable Matthew Waterfield, from Cleveland Police, said:

'This was an horrific incident and the victim has shown strength and courage throughout this investigation.

'We are pleased with the sentence which reflects the true nature of the danger that Timothy Hagar poses.

'This should spell a warning for anyone thinking of taking part in alcohol-fuelled violence.'
