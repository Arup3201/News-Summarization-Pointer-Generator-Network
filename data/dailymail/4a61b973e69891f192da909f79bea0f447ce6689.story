Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge is ready to lead the quest for a cup double as he prepares to make his long-awaited European debut for the club.

Sturridge missed the whole of Liverpool’s doomed Champions League campaign because of thigh and calf problems, with his personal low coming when he had to sit as a frustrated spectator for the clash with Real Madrid in the Bernabeu last November.

He also missed the Europa League ties against Zenit St Petersburg in February 2013, having already played in the Champions League for Chelsea during that season, but ahead of the round-of-32 clash with Besiktas, the England striker has no barriers in front of him.

Brendan Rodgers is eager for his side to attack the Europa League and prove that their performance in the Champions League was a blip. And having Sturridge primed to lead his attack means Liverpool will be a different proposition in the coming months.

‘I’ve waited such a long time to play this game,’ said Sturridge, who has scored two goals in five appearances since launching his comeback. ‘It has been very difficult to sit and watch those games in the Champions League without being part of it — very, very hard.

‘But I have to be positive and look forward. I just want to get out there and play now, and enjoy it and hopefully have some success with the team.

‘It wasn’t just that game in the Bernabeu that was difficult; every game was hard to watch, every single game.

‘I was watching (the final games) from America, hoping and praying we’d go through, but it wasn’t to be. That’s football. Sometimes you don’t get what you want. But that doesn’t make us any less determined in the Europa League. We want to win it. We want success.’

Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since they last played in Europe before Christmas.

The England striker has been in good form since returning from injury, scoring twice in five games 

They are 90 minutes from an appearance at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals, well positioned to attack the top four in the Barclays Premier League and have ambitions to flourish in the Europa League.

Rodgers is eager for his players to show themselves in a different light against Besiktas, whose arrival on Merseyside was delayed last night by adverse weather conditions in Istanbul.

He is still vexed by Liverpool’s failure to perform as he had hoped in the biggest competition of all.

‘I was always hopeful we could still be in the Champions League at this stage and show our way of working,’ said Rodgers, who will have Raheem Sterling available after injury. ‘It was not to be but this is still a very good competition.

‘We will attack these games in this competition like we have in the last few months. It is a competition I would like to do really well in.

‘Managers will approach it differently and every club’s needs are different.

‘It is a prestigious tournament. You have seen teams under Gerard Houllier win the Uefa Cup and for me this is the Uefa Cup.

‘It is a tournament that has some wonderful teams in it and we want to win it.’
