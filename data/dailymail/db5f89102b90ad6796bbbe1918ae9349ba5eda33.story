Half of a power station which supplies electricity to a million homes will remain out of action indefinitely following a major blaze – prompting blackout fears.

The devastating blaze at the Didcot B site in Oxfordshire comes days before National Grid sets out its winter outlook, amid worries over how it will keep the lights on if there is an 'energy crunch'.

It is expected to put further pressure on the UK's squeezed electricity network and could result in supply failing to keep up with demand.

Firefighters are investigating the cause of a major blaze at Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire

The fire broke out about 8pm last night. There are no reports of any injuries, according to officials

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said National Grid had assured him that there was no risk to energy supplies

But a spokesman for the Grid said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on October 28

At least 25 fire engines and around 100 firefighters raced battle the flames which ripped through four cooling towers, leaving the plant operating at 50 per cent capacity.

Fire officers are currently investigating the cause of the blaze, but they have ruled out arson and terrorism.

This is the latest blaze to hit Britain's power capacity, with Ironbridge and Ferrybridge crippled by fires earlier this year.

Energy supply has also been hit by plans to close a site at Barking in east London.

A spokeswoman at Oxfordshire Fire Service confirmed investigating officers will visit the scene this morning, and said they are likely to remain there throughout the day

It also emerged that four EDF nuclear power reactors, which shut down after a defect was discovered, will be operating at three-quarters capacity by the end of this year.

Officials at the RWE npower owned site - who carry out regular safety drills - managed to shut down the Didcot site quickly to stop the incident turning into an inferno.

A spokesman for RWE said: 'The affected part of the site will remain non-operational until an investigation and repairs can take place. It is too early to give any definitive estimate of how long this will be.'

Npower said the plant was only producing half as much power as it normally would for the National Grid, but that all 70 of its staff who work there were at the station today.

Dorian Lucas, energy analyst at Inenco, said the long term impact of the fire on the UK's power supply could be 'significant' if the damage takes some time to repair

The B Station opened in July 1997. The A Station, a combined coal and oil plant, shut last year

The company said it will begin its own assessment of the damage once the fire service has left.

An Npower spokesman said: 'One bank of cooling towers has been unaffected which means the station can still operate but it could take a week or two before the plant is fully operational.

'The assessment of the damage and repair costs won't start until the fire service has left.'

There were no reports of casualties, but Thames Valley Police were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'First, I want to thank the emergency services who are at Didcot working to tackle the blaze.

A total of four cooling towers were affected by the blaze and two of those were completely destroyed

'I've been reassured by National Grid that there is no risk to electricity supplies.

'I will be keeping in touch with the relevant authorities throughout. My priority is to understand the cause of the fire and get the affected unit back generating electricity as soon as it's safe to do so.'

But a spokesman for the National Grid said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on October 28.

The latest outage appears to bring closer a 'last resort' scenario described by Mr Davey earlier this year to keep the lights on.

This would see factories paid to shut down in peak times and mothballed power stations being fired up to supply reserve power.

The UK is facing an energy crunch over the next two winters when the capacity margin - how much its total generating capacity outstrips expected peak demand - is expected to shrink to as little as 2 per cent.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: 'The lights will not go out this winter.

'Up and down the country there are power stations on standby that can start pumping out power when needed, and the Government has given National Grid the extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights.

'There have been some unexpected closures over the past few months and National Grid is buying some extra energy supply to make up for any shortfall.

'The Government will continue to work with National Grid and energy providers to make sure the system remains secure over the coming months.'

A spokesman for RWE npower said: 'We can confirm that no one is injured which is clearly the most important thing and also that the fire is now under control' 

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'First, I want to thank the emergency services who are at Didcot working to tackle the blaze'

It is not clear how the Didcot fire started, but officials have ruled out arson or terrorism.

Oxfordshire's assistant chief fire officer, Simon Furlong, said the blaze began in one of Didcot B power station's cooling towers and spread to three other towers.

Mr Furlong said: 'We responded to the scene and worked well to extinguish the fire.

'We work closely in partnership with the power station to ensure we have plans in place should an incident of this nature actually happen.

'The fire itself was extinguished quickly - there are no reports of injuries, which of course is pleasing.

'We have three fire engines on-scene still, dampening down hot spots and we will continue to have a presence there for at least the next 24 hours.

'An investigation has begun in conjunction with other agencies regarding the cause of the fire.

'I expect that it will take some time to determine the reasons behind what actually happened.'  

Power station has dominated Oxfordshire skyline since building work started on the A Station in the 1960s

Around 12 fire crews attended the power station at around 9pm, but that number doubled as flames took hold

The charred remains of the cooling towers are seen at the plant, which is around 70 miles west of London

Resident Steve Shadbolt said: 'I looked across at the power station and there was this bright light. I got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight'

Local resident Daniel Anderton tweeted: 'It was well alight. Lots of fire brigade, police and helicopters...'

Fellow Didcot local Amy Lambourne said: 'It still looked very bad even after an hour.' 

Steve Shadbolt told the Oxford Mail newspaper: 'I live on Great Western Park and I looked across at the power station and there was this bright light.  

'I got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight.

'It burnt so fiercely that it spread to the next one.'

The power station has dominated the Oxfordshire skyline since construction work started on the A Station in the 1960s.

The B Station opened in July 1997. The A Station, a combined coal and oil plant, shut last year. Its three giant cooling towers were demolished in July.

Hundreds watched as the blast, using more than 400lb of explosives, flattened 36,000 tons of material in seconds. 

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change has said there will be no blackouts this winter
