It was intended as a romantic gesture to welcome his girlfriend home from a month abroad.

But a hapless boyfriend’s attempt at setting the mood backfired when candles he placed on the bedroom floor started a blaze which then tore through the house.

With champagne chilling and flowers scattered, Amanj Issen used tea lights to spell out his girlfriend’s name and a heart.

Hapless romantic: Amanj Issen lit his girlfriend's name in tea lights in their bedroom - sparking a huge fire

A hunk of burning love: How the bedroom looked after the fire. His girlfriend was still touched by the gesture

However, as he waited excitedly by the front door for Jana Stankeviciute to return, he heard a loud bang.

Mr Issen ran upstairs at their home in Chatham, Kent, only to be beaten back by flames and smoke.

The couple’s bedroom was destroyed by the fire on Saturday and the rest of the terraced house suffered smoke damage.

Miss Stankeviciute, 24, said she was still touched when Mr Issen showed her photos of the display – and he insisted he would repeat the gesture ‘but maybe just with flowers and chocolates’.

The 29-year-old builder yesterday said he was shocked the small candles had led to such extensive damage.

His girlfriend had been visiting family in Latvia and was almost home when he was forced to call 999.

‘I just wanted to surprise Jana as I had not seen her in so long,’ he said.

‘She called me when she was just a couple of minutes away and asked if I could meet her outside the house to help her with her bags.

‘I told her that I was already outside and that I was in big trouble.’

When the builder explained what had happened, his girlfriend simply assured him that she was happy nobody had been hurt.

Mr Issen added: ‘The first thing she said to me was ‘I’m just glad you are OK’. Then I showed her the picture of the candles and she aid "wow". She really loved it.’

The ‘stressed’ couple are urgently looking for new accommodation as the rented home – which they have lived in for 15 months – has been destroyed by fire and smoke.

Mr Issen, who has lived in the UK for 12 years after moving from Kurdistan, said that he hopes the experience will make other people use candles safely.

He said: ‘I hope this can save somebody else as I would not want anybody to have to go through this.’

Fireman Paul Nash, who attended the blaze, said tea lights reach ‘extremely high temperatures’, adding: ‘If they’re placed directly on a plastic or combustible surface they quickly melt into the material and can cause a fire. 

'We realise that tea lights have become increasingly popular in recent years to create a relaxing or romantic atmosphere in the home.

‘However, many people are still unaware of the dangers that candles and tea lights can present.

‘The flame from a candle can quickly ignite a nearby curtain or clothing if it’s placed too close, or gets knocked over.

‘Candles that are forgotten and left unattended can also cause fires if not placed in proper candle holders.

‘Because tea lights come with a flat metal base many people think it is safe to place them directly onto any surface without a candle holder or a heat resistant saucer.'  

Mr Issen said: 'I hope this can save somebody else as I would not want anybody to have to go through this'

Desperate times: The couple have gone from flowers and champagne to searching for a new home
