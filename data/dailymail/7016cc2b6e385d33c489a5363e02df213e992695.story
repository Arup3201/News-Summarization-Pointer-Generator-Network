Found dead: Laura Ferguson, 26, died in her sleep after battling with anorexia

A 26-year-old showjumper who suffered from anorexia died in her sleep after fighting a five-year battle with the eating disorder following the death of her mother.

Laura Ferguson went to bed complaining about stinging eyes, tiredness and a sore head on Sunday.

The next day her father was unable to wake her.

The care support worker had been struggling with the eating disorder since her mother Anne, 54, passed away after suffering a heart attack in the bath on Christmas Day in 2008. 

During her illness she had posted pictures of her skinny legs on Facebook but in recent months Ms Ferguson had begun to get better and gain some weight again after getting treatment at an eating disorder rehabilitation clinic.

Just hours before her death, she wrote on her Facebook page that she was enjoying carrot and coriander soup.

She wrote: 'Omg why am I starting to come to life now when it's bed time!'

She had also told friends she had 'not been this happy for years' and had even developed a craving for certain foods, leading her father to believe she had beaten the illness.

Joe Ferguson a 59-year-old retired upholsterer, from Burnley, Lancashire said: ‘Laura had an eating disorder after her mum died but she was doing all right and she had put a bit of weight back on.

‘She came home at 6pm and she was not working again until 8pm that evening. 

‘She had a sit down and we were talking and playing with the dog.

‘Laura went to work at 8pm and she came home again at 9.10pm, had her tea and we sat in the living room.

‘She
said she was tired, had a bit of a headache and that her eyes were 
stinging. I told her to have an early night and she went to bed at 
11.10pm.

‘In the morning, I
went downstairs for a brew and to take the dog out. I bobbed my head 
around the door of her room and it looked like she was asleep.

‘She had the TV on and her eyes were half open and I thought she was dozing. I thought she was having a lie-in.

‘At dinner time I thought I had better wake her up and I found her still the same.

‘I rushed downstairs and phoned the emergency services but it was too late.’

Looked like she was asleep: Ms Ferguson's father Joe Ferguson thought she was dozing when he checked her on Monday morning. It wasn't until later that he realised she had died

In one Facebook message posted just 
two days before her death she wrote to a fellow horse rider taking part 
in a competition: 'Good luck. I'm working tomoz, I'm putting more hours 
into work now I've not got a horse.

'It's
amazing how much spare money I have now lol I never thought I'd be 
happy without a horse but I haven't been this happy for years, in fact 
it was before my mum died was last time I was happy!'

She
added: 'Been like this for about a year now taking a fetish on certain 
foods then a month later I have a fetish on something else!

'Been
through loads, egg mayo fetish, beet root fetish, tomato fetish, mashed
potato fetish, chocolate fetish, fudge, mints, Turkish delight ah the 
list goes on! Pmsl x.'

Ms 
Ferguson, who won a gold medal for England at a pony jumping competition
in Northern Ireland, was found dead on Monday, the day after she 
complained of tiredness after work.

Her
father said: ‘She was happy with what she was doing and she loved going
out to work. Laura always had a good word for anybody.

‘We were really close and I cannot understand how this happened now.

Happy and healthy: Ms Ferguson (left and right pictured with mother Anne) had been 'happy with what she was doing and loved going to work,' her father said

‘We were going on holiday to Egypt next month and she was really looking forward to it.

‘She was counting down the days and had bought a load of new clothes. 

‘She was kind and loving. I will miss her like mad.’

The young woman had competed in showjumping at a national level and trained many horses, one going on to be sold for £750,000.

Mr Ferguson said: 'When she 14 she represented England at a competition in Ireland and won a gold medal. We went all over the country competing and she would always come back with rosettes, we didn't buy the horses good, she made them good.

Devastating news: Facebook tributes poured in for the care support worker, a former student at Ivy Bank High School

'I am a very proud father. She was very 
special, her talent never went to her head and she rode for the love of 
doing it. Anne was very proud of her too.'

Tributes also poured in on Facebook for the former Ivy Bank High School pupil. 

Lynda Barlow said: ‘Devastating news. We are in shock. Spain is such a long way from the family at this awful time. 

‘Never to hear Laura’s messages - too hard to bear - and hugs when we arrive to visit Burnley. 

‘Thoughts
go back to Laura at our nursery, and house parties with Laura’s pranks 
as she grew up.  Such fond memories. We will miss her so much.

‘Thoughts are with Joe and mum as she takes in the shock of the loss of her granddaughter who she loved so much.’

Danielle Reekie, who used to ride with Ms Ferguson, said: ‘Such shocking and sad news, I can’t believe it. 

‘I remember sharing one of the happiest days of my life with you, when we jumped for England and won the gold all those years ago.

‘You’ll be very missed by a lot of people. Can’t imagine what your family are going through.’

The coroner was informed and a post mortem examination has been carried out but found no sign of self-harm or the use of drugs or alcohol.

More tests are to be carried out to determine how Ms Ferguson died.
