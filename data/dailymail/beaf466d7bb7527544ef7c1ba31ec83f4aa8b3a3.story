Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was standing in a toilet cubicle facing the closed door when she was hit in the right hip by the first of four bullets fired by the double-amputee athlete, a police ballistics expert said on Wednesday.

Captain Christiaan Mangena told 
Pretoria's High Court that Ms Steenkamp then fell back on to a 
magazine holder by the toilet before she was hit by a further two 
bullets fired by Pistorius through the wood door.

One bullet fired from the 9mm pistol struck her in the right arm and while another penetrated her skull as she crossed her arms over her head to protect herself, Captain Mangena said.

As Mangena threw his hands up to 
cover his head in court and replicate the 'defensive position' he said 
Steenkamp took as the last shots were fired, Pistorius put his fingers 
in his ears in an apparent attempt to block out the testimony.

June
 Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, also was in the courtroom and occasionally 
glanced at photos of the bloody scene of her daughter's shooting before 
looking away.Â 

Mr Mangena also testified that he believed the second bullet fired missed Ms Steenkamp 
and ricocheted off a wall inside the cubicle and broke into fragments, 
which caused bruising on her back.

Mr
 Mangena concluded, through his analysis of the shooting scene and 
wounds on Ms Steenkamp's body from post-mortem photos, that one bullet 
went through Ms Steenkamp's left hand before penetrating her skull as 
she held it over her head.

The policeman said he could not determine the order of the last two shots.

Pistorius,
 27, is charged with premeditated murder over Ms Steenkamp's death on 
February 14 last year and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

He
 says he shot Ms Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his 
bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night-time intruder in 
his home.

Pistorius 
says Ms Steenkamp went to use the toilet during the night without him 
knowing, but prosecutors maintain he killed her after a loud argument 
that caused her to possibly flee and hide in the toilet area.

Mr
 Mangena said the bullet that struck Ms Steenkamp's skull broke into two
 fragments, one of which exited her head and struck the wall behind her.
 The first shot into the right hip broke Ms Steenkamp's hip bone, Mr 
Mangena said.

'I'm of the opinion that after this wound was inflicted, she dropped immediately,' Mr Mangena said.

He
 said Ms Steenkamp then slumped into a 'seated or semi-seated position' 
on top of a magazine rack near the toilet, where she was hit another two
 times.

'She ended up with her head on top of the toilet seat, and the lower part of her body on the rack', Mr Mangena said.

Pistorius
 fired from a distance of at least 60 centimetres (24in) and no further 
than a wall behind him, about three metres (10ft) away, Mr Mangena said.

He also described the impact of the type of bullets in Pistorius' gun, which were designed to cause maximum damage, he said.

'It
 hits the target, it opens up, it creates six talons, and these talons 
are sharp,' Mr Mangena said. 'It cuts through the organs of a human 
being.'

He noted the 
Black Talon brand of ammunition was often used for self-defence because 
while it caused significant damage to a human target, it was less likely
 to penetrate the first target and hit other people.

Mr
 Mangena also said he conducted shooting tests to try to pinpoint the 
location from which the bullets were fired by Pistorius in the bathroom,
 based on where the cartridge cases were found.

However,
 in his tests, he said, the cases fell at different angles. He also 
noted that the cartridge cases at the scene of Ms Steenkamp's shooting 
could have been 'moved or kicked around' during the investigation.

He
 said Pistorius was probably on his stumps when he fired, supporting the
 athlete's statement that he was not wearing his prosthetic limbs when 
he opened fire.

Mr Nel 
also asked Mr Mangena to comment on a 2012 incident in which Pistorius 
allegedly fired his gun out of the sunroof of a moving car. The athlete 
faces a firearms charge in that case, as well as two other firearms 
charges.

Mr Mangena said firing a shot in such circumstances was dangerous.

The
 bullet leaves the barrel at around 280 metres (900 feet) a second, and 
will travel upward, then stop and fall to the ground under the force of 
gravity and wind deflection, he said.

'The bullet can still kill a person,' Mr Mangena said.

The trial has been adjourned until Monday.
