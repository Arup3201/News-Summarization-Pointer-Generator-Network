He may be without a club at present but that hasn't stopped Ravel Morrison linking up with whom many refer to as the best player on the planet.

Morrison, who had his contract terminated at West Ham last month, bumped into Barcelona superstar and 'maestro' Lionel Messi while out and about on Monday afternoon.

The chance occasion was clearly one the 22-year-old didn't want to miss out on as a photo was taken with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner before being uploaded to Instagram.

Teams played for: West Ham, Cardiff (loan), QPR (loan), Birmingham (loan), Manchester United

Appearances: 81

Goals: 14

Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011)

While Messi, who was in London on Sunday night with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo and former Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas and his partner Daniella Semaan, is continuing to break records this season Morrison is just a mere spectator.

The 22-year-old, who has signed a pre-contract agreement with Lazio, is a free agent.

However, the midfielder cannot represent another club this season as he has played in two countries - England and Wales - this term and FIFA don't allow a third.

Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31.

A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December.

However, the England Under 21 international will now look to resume his career in Italy next season.
