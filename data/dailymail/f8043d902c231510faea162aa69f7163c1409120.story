Renting a home is now significantly cheaper than buying one thanks to the non-stop house price boom, with the gap growing over recent months.

For every £1 spent by a homeowner on repaying the mortgage, a renter in an equivalent property pays just 93p, according to new figures.

Just one year ago, renters were paying only four per cent less than homeowners, but as house prices have continued to soar buying a home has become increasingly unaffordable.

Boom: House prices have risen by around 11 per cent in the past year, making home ownership unaffordable

The price of the average home in the UK has risen by 11 per cent over the past year, to a new high of £260,000.

By contrast, the cost of renting rose by 3.7 per cent in the year to April, according to figures from property firm Countrywide.

Across the nation, the average monthly rent stands at £873, up from £837 a year ago.

The company says that for every £1 of mortgage repayments by a homeowner with a 10 per cent deposit, the average renter has to pay only 93p.

That gap is even wider in London, epicentre of the housing boom, where renters pay just 86p compared to mortgage repayments.

Renting is now cheaper than buying in all but three of the capital's 33 boroughs, as areas such as Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Croydon have become increasingly fashionable with buyers.

The gap between renting and buying has widened in all parts of the UK bar South Wales and North-East England, where house prices have fallen in recent months.

Other data support Countrywide's figures - statistics compiled by The Economist suggest that British house prices are overvalued by more than 30 per cent in comparison to rents.

Unlike other countries such as the U.S., where house prices collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis, the UK's housing market has remained relatively strong, thanks partly to demand for prime central London property from the world's super-rich.

However, tough new rules on mortgage eligibility could see a fall in lending which could bring the five-year boom to an end.

Housing ladder: Renting is now considerably cheaper than owning your own home, according to new data

'Home ownership has long been part of the British psyche,' said Nick Dunning of Countrywide.

'However, for many households, particularly in the short to medium term, home ownership doesn't always make sense financially or otherwise.

'As house prices rise, renting increasingly allows people to live in areas they would otherwise be unable to afford to buy.

In more expensive cities, such as London, the cost of renting in more central areas can be just half the cost of buying.'

He added: #While in the long term capital repayments will mean that homeowners build up equity in their property, in the shorter term, purchase costs such as stamp duty and the ongoing costs of maintenance can mean the cost of homeownership is considerably higher than renting.

'In the first year of ownership, taking into account all associated costs, a buyer with a 10 per cent deposit will pay 35 per cent more than someone renting the equivalent property.'
