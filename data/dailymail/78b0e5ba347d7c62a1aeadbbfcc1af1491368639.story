Olympic sailing champion Sir Ben Ainslie has announced his engagement to TV presenter Georgie Thompson.

loveliest woman in the World. Biggles is pretty excited too!'

Thompson then posted on her account, saying: 'This just in… @AinslieBen and I are getting

Sky Sports presenter Thompson also shared the exciting news on her own Twitter account

The couple first roused interest when they were spotted kissing while on a trip to New York in October 2013.

Georgie, who previously dated Declan Donnelly for over two years, later revealed the couple had been in a quiet relationship since April - but they had known each other for three years before.

She said in an interview with the Mail: 'We met through friends at an event and I don’t really know how to describe it. It was a bit of a thunderbolt moment but a thunderbolt that took years before it became anything real.

'We were in different places, but then 
in April the stars aligned and it made sense to be together and we 
haven’t looked back since. It’s very special… he makes me very happy.'

Ainslie has won four Olympic gold medals, putting him fourth on the list of most successful British Olympians

And aside from having to deal with their rather noticeable height difference, Georgie and Ben also have to battle against the perils of a long-distance relationship, with him living in San Francisco and her in New York, where her new job at Fox Sports is based.

She added: 'I’m 5ft; he’s 6ft, and it’s good because he puts a protective arm around me.

'Because I
 understand his world but I’m not in it so I can be that person who 
listens but at the same time can offer a different perspective, and he’s
 the same with me.

'He lives in San Francisco so now I’m in New York I’ve sort of moved five hours closer to him. It’s a long-distance scenario, but when you really want to be with each other, you find a way to make it work.'
