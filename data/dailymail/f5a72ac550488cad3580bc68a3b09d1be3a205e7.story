You might think that happy, healthy and educated kids don't give much thought to complex human rights issues, but Australian children are more socially aware than they are often given credit for.

At just 10 years of age, Maddie Alfred already worries about complex issues such as child labour, child marriage and children in detention.

'Refugee children shouldn't be locked up they should have the same rights as us go to school and stuff,' Maddie said.

'And also in poor countries they shouldn't have to work or get married at an early age.'

But it's not just issues affecting children from overseas that Australian kids are worried about.

New research shows that just one in seven Australian children think their friends are safe from violence or bullying.

A global survey conducted by international aid group ChildFund Alliance found that 24 per cent of kids aged between 10 and 12 think that children's rights to protection in our country are not being met.

The survey of more than 6000 kids also found just 14 per cent of Australian children said young people in our country are always protected from physical or psychological harm.

Diana Masonis from ChildFund Australia said even though the issues are advanced for 10 to 12 year olds, Australian children are very socially aware.

'Children were absolutely showing an awareness of the reality of their peers within their friends and at school,' Ms Masonis said.

'They were saying children who live in families experiencing domestic violence, those children's rights are not being upheld.

'There were lots of quotes saying children should be free from racism, that people being bullied for being themselves was wrong.'

Ms Masonis said Australian children also showed compassion for children in situations less fortunate than themselves, recognising that not all young people have access to the four main rights of survival, development, protection and participation.

'They want the world to be fair,' she said.

'I think children in Australia have access to a lot of information and they're very interested in what's happening to their peers, other children in Australia and around the world.'

The campaign marks the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child

It is is aimed at ensuring more is done to address the breaches of human rights that still plague children around the world

This comes as Maddie, from West Pymble in Sydney, and other Australian children have featured alongside kids from around the world in a video addressed to world leaders.

The campaign, which marks the 25th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, is aimed at ensuring more is done to address the breaches of human rights that still plague children around the world.

Maddie said she thought the finished product looked very good.

'I thought it was quite clever, how they sort of take everyone's voice and put it into a sentence and how they all say the same thing, to show respect,' she said.

'I filmed it at my house, it was very tiring because we did it for three hours.'

The 10-year-old said she often talks about children's rights with her family.

More than 6000 children from 44 countries participated in a survey about children's rights and what they mean

'I think that um children's rights means even poor ones have the right to learn and grow to go to school and be treated nicely,' she said.

'And the right to be happy and not go to war, because I sort of know about how there's lots of things that have been happening in those countries.'

But Maddie said she didn't think most kids in Australia really understood what child rights are.

'They take them all for granted, because we are quite lucky and we have money,' she said.

'And we get to go to school, well we have to go to school, and we get to have fun and play.'

Lily Nigro, 12, from Lisarow on the NSW Central Coast, also appeared in the video said she thought children's rights included many different things.

'Being safe, being able to have food and water, being able to have shelter, being in a place where there's no wars and being with their families,' she said.
