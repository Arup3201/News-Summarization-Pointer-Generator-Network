While there are many brands to choose from, most will agree the most important part of any advent calendar is what lies behind its windows.

And though once painted with scenes of the nativity, the majority are now filled with little slabs of chocolate to be eaten before breakfast. 

But one luxury retailer has shunned tradition to create perhaps the most extravagant advent of all - a £12,000 Advent House complete with 24 individual custom porcelain ornaments.

The Wedgwood Advent House costs £12,000. Behind each of its 24 windows is a custom porcelain ornament which comes with a velvet pouch

The white and blue house, created by British pottery firm Wedgwood, is modelled on Georgian architecture. 

Behind each of its 24 expertly crafted windows lies a tiny, porcelain ornament which comes with its own velvet pouch. 

On sale for £12,500, the pretty house even has a light dusting of false snow on its roof. 

With only three of the limited edition product made, it is being sold exclusively by Harrods - and is being sold at a discount today for £9,000,000.

'This truly captivating treasure trove is full of seasonal cheer and is sure to earn its place as a family heirloom of the future to be enjoyed by all, year after year,' a spokesman for the brand said. 

Behind each of the 24 expertly moulded windows are custom ornaments, hand-painted in blue and white with silk ribbon attached 

The ornaments and house are being sold exclusively at Harrods. Only three of the limited edition models have been made and sold 

They each come with their own velvet pouches and are inserted in through the back of the porcelain house to opened every day of the month

'Just three limited edition Advent Houses have been made are are only available from Harrods and Wedgwood.'

The house's rear doors open fully to allow safe storage of the ornaments before they are unveiled during advent.

In 2010 a Belgian jewellers produced what is thought to be the world's most expensive advent calendar, with 24 diamonds totalling more than 81-carats designated for each day of December. 

The piece, a staggering £1.7million, took 50 staff to complete. 

While a far cry from a £1million of diamonds or the Wedgwood porcelain house, Harrods has created a  decadent calendar of its own. 

The £135 product for children is entirely empty - apart from the Christmas day slot which opens to a music player programmed with festive songs. 

In December 2010 a Belgian jeweller created a £1.7million diamond advent calendar with 24 gems totalling 81-carats
