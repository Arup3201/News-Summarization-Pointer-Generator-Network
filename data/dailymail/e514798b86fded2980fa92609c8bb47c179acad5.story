From a tacky knitted baby through to a Harrods mug and a prince's potty chair, these are the bizarre souvenirs retailers are trying to flog on the back of the royal birth.

A bewildering array of memorabilia will flood into stores over the next few days as shops try and cash in on the feel good factor.

And some retailers are trying to get in on the act early with mugs, tea towels, plates and dolls on sale even before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is named.

Analysts predict that nearly £250million could be spent on royal baby related souvenirs over coming days. The wider boost to the economy could be worth as much as £500million.

Souvenirs, memorabilia and food and drink will sell on the back of the royal birth immediately - while in the longer-term royal themed pushchairs and clothing will make millions, according to valuation experts Brand Finance.

The new baby's midas touch will supplement the Royal family's annual contribution to the British economy which Brand Finance estimates to stand at £1.5 billion so far this year alone.

The firm says the new baby will swell the coffers and enhance the assets of the family as a whole, including Crown Estate and Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, which stands at £53.6 billion.

The most desirable pieces are likely to be the ceramic cups, dishes and bowls which will vary from the cheap and cheerful to gold leaf-covered fine bone china creations costing hundreds of pounds.

Stoke-on-Trent, the home of England's pottery industry, was a hive of activity as companies geared up for the birth.

Designs have been drawn up and potters are waiting for the moment William and Kate's baby is named.

Dr Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, highlighted how foreign collectors, especially from countries such as America and Japan, prize items from the UK.

She said: 'This will be a welcome boost for UK tableware and giftware manufacturers, generating significant sales for many companies in the UK and overseas.

'UK manufacturers are uniquely placed to commence manufacturing as soon as the baby's name is announced and so respond rapidly to orders.

'Many customers value the "Made in England" backstamp on cherished family items such as these marking royal occasions.'

Memorabilia to mark the royal birth will be led by the official range produced by the Royal Collection Trust.

In recent years, the organisation has produced high-quality bone china items to mark historic moments for the monarchy.

Although they are expected to launch a royal baby product range in the coming days, nothing has appeared on their website yet.

A spokeswoman for the trust said: 'Royal Collection Trust has produced a number of commemorative china ranges to celebrate royal anniversaries and events, most recently for the royal wedding, the Diamond Jubilee, and the anniversary of the coronation in 2013.

'An official range to celebrate the birth of a future monarch would be made, but not until after the event.'

If the trust follows its past ranges, the items on sale could include a coffee mug, tankard, pillbox and plate decorated with a floral pattern or even heraldic creatures.

The pieces are likely to feature the individual cyphers of the Duke and Duchess - their initials, W or C, below a coronet - the baby's name and date it was born.

In past years, members of the monarchy have approved designs before they have gone into production, so William and Kate are likely to have already cast an eye over the plans.

Pricey: World's most expensive baby monitor which costs £35,000

This really is the king of baby gadgets... The world's most expensive baby monitor has been invented in time for the new royal arrival.

Engineers at French electronics specialists Withings have spent two months designing a bespoke 24 carat gold gadget, worth £35,000, for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

With an in-built high definition camera, night-vision, and alerts that monitor noise, motion, temperature and humidity, the device will keep Kate and Wills close - even if they're in the other side of Kensington Palace.

The first-time parents have been sent the state-of-the-art gadget to their Berkshire manor, which will transmit video of their son direct to their smart phones - no matter how far away they are.

The couple will also be able to interact with him, and control the lighting and temperature from a distance.
