Town halls may be forced to switch off street lights unless they get more money to pay for the care of the elderly in their own homes, council leaders have warned.

They have written to the Chancellor to plead for more NHS funding to be diverted into their coffers to help meet the spiralling costs of care for pensioners and the disabled.

Local government heads say they would have to consider efficiency measures including closing parks and libraries, as well as switching off street lights, just to maintain their legal obligation to provide care.

The letter to George Osborne, from the Tory-dominated Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils, comes as he finalises the next round of cuts in the spending review.

The LGA argues that the amount of money spent on social care has already been slashed by a fifth in less than three years - and they warn that they are preparing to reduce budgets further.

The town hall leaders say that, while they have been able to save most of that money by squeezing the amount they pay to care homes and other contractors, they are running out of ways to cut costs.

The LGA’s letter calls for fundamental change in the way money is allocated and an end to the special protections that the health service budget enjoys.

‘Social care is one of the things that you lie awake at night worrying about,’ said Sir Merrick Cockell, the Conservative leader of Kensington and Chelsea council in London, who is chairman of the LGA.

‘It is one of the most serious responsibilities that we have got and we take that very seriously but we know that we can’t really restrict the spending any more.

‘Most of us are pretty well at the “critical” level, as far as criteria for care go, we know we’ve got an ageing population and care is becoming more expensive, all the pressures are there.’ 

He added: ‘If Government doesn’t give us what we hope on sharing and integration at national and local budget level, the services like libraries, like leisure centres, like the way that parks are kept or indeed street lights being on all through the night, councils will have to look at saving money on those things.’
