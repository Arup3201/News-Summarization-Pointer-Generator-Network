If your favourite vacuum cleaner is the type that threatens to suck up the entire carpet, the furniture and the family pet, prepare for some bad news.

Many of the best cleaners currently on sale are to be banned under an EU energy efficiency drive which comes into force next month.

Those who want a powerful model have been urged to act quickly and buy their new machine before it sells out.

Banned: VAX Power 3 U88– P3–B (2000 W) (left), Bosch BSG8PRO1 (1800w) (centre) and Miele S5281 (2200w) - rated as a 'best buy' by Which? reviewers - are among the models that will be prohibited

From September 1 companies will be prohibited from manufacturing or importing any vacuums with motors above 1,600 watts.

Consumer magazine Which? said the ban will spell the end of many vacuums its testers rate among the best on sale.

Here are five of Britain's most popular vacuum cleaners that will be banned when the new regulations are introduced

1. Hoover Spirit TSP2101 (2100w)

2. Miele S5281 (2200w)

3. VAX Power 3 U88– P3–B (2000 W)

4. Samsung CycloneForce Sensor (2100w)

5. Bosch BSG8PRO1 (1800w)

... And four top selling models on Amazon.co.uk that will be banned by 2017

1. Numatic HVR200A Henry A1 Bagged Cylinder Vacuum Cleaner (1,200W)

2. Vax W90-RU-P Rapide Ultra 2 Pre-Treatment Upright Carpet and Upholstery Washer (1,000W)

3. Vax U90-MA-R Air Reach Multicyclonic Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner (1,200W)

4. Sebo X4EXTRA Automatic Upright Vacuum Cleaner (1,300W)

Of seven models the magazine has rated as a ‘best buy’ since January 2013, five have motors above 1,600 watts.

The
 European Commission said the rules, intended to help tackle climate 
change by cutting energy usage across Europe, will lead to ‘better 
vacuum cleaners than ever before’.

But
 Ukip MEP Louise Bours claimed the legislation will do nothing to help 
climate change, with lower-powered vacuums succeeding only in making 
‘life harder for house-proud householders’.

The maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017.

Current cleaners have an average of 1,800 watts.

Which?
 says: ‘If you’re in the market for a powerful vacuum, you should act 
quickly, before all of the models currently available sell out.

‘A
 best buy 2,200-watt vac costs around £27 a year to run in electricity –
 only £8 more than the best-scoring 1,600-watt we’ve tested.’

An
 EU energy label will be introduced, giving vacuum cleaners A to G 
ratings for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors,
 and dust emissions.

The label also requires a minimum level of 
performance for the vacuum to be sold in the EU.

'Act quickly': Which? has warned consumers that vacuum cleaner models such as the Samsung CycloneForce Sensor (2100w) (left) and Hoover Spirit TSP2101 (2100w) will sell out ahead of the new regulations

But
 the scheme is self-regulating, meaning that manufacturers will create 
their own labels, and Which? said it was unclear if the results would be
 corroborated by an independent third party.

Sir
 James Dyson, whose company pioneered ‘bagless’ cleaners and campaigned 
for a cap on wattage, said the eco-labels could be misleading because 
they did not take account of the cost of ‘consumables’ – vacuum bags and
 filters, which often cannot be recycled.

He said: 'A label should help people choose high performing, energy efficient technology not hide important information.

'The environmental impact of bags and filters is ignored. And the label misleads people by showing the energy scores of vacuum cleaners tested without dust inside.

'Machines should be tested for real world conditions, not just for a Brussels test lab – that’s why we’re taking it to judicial review at the European Courts.'

Ukip
 health spokesman Miss Bours said a cut in vacuum motor power may affect
 those with lung conditions such as asthma, which ‘can be exacerbated by
 dust mite allergy’.

Marlene
 Holzner, the European Commission’s energy spokesman, says the amount of
 wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform.

What counted was how efficiently a vacuum translated its electrical 
power into picking up dust, which would be measured under the new rules.

The measures will also be extended to appliances, including water heaters and tumble dryers.

The
 Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances said: ‘The industry
 has been working on designs to meet the requirements, as well as 
overcome any concerns about how lower power outputs may affect 
performance.’

Since the 2010 general election Brussels has handed down almost 3,600 pieces of new regulation and directives affecting British businesses.

Last year, European Union officials came close to banning olive oil jugs and dipping bowls from restaurants. The plan, which would have forced restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles, with tamper-proof lids was withdrawn following extensive opposition.

There was proposed EU legislation to ban the Union flag, along with flags and signs representing Scotland, Wales and Ireland from packs of meat.

Some of the world’s most popular perfumes - including Chanel No 5 - are under threat from planned EU regulations that target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies.

In May it emerged that best-before dates on kitchen cupboard items such as tinned goods and olive oil could be scrapped after several EU countries warned that they lead to the waste of million of tons of food a year.

The EU has also proposed regulations on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay, the labelling of spirits and the use of rosemary extracts in certain low-fat meat and fish products.
