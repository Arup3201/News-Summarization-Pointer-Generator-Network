One wrong breath - let alone move - and there would be an awful lot of sweeping up to do.

This is Philip Osenton as he broke the world record for the number of wine glasses held on one hand.

He went on to balance 51, far surpassing the previous record of 39.

The 43-year-old British wine consultant, who works in Beijing, said he learnt his art when he was head sommelier at the Ritz and the Savoy in London.

'The carrying of glasses is a sommelier thing. When I was head sommelier at the Ritz hotel, Iâ€™ve had a 140-cover restaurant to set up in the morning between breakfast and lunch, so basically with two glasses per setting I had got 280 glasses to put out with a very short amount of time.

'You have a lot of pressure to get the room ready.'

In his first attempt Philip managed 45 glasses in one go, but made it to 51 on a second try, stacking the glasses on their side on top of each other in his left hand.

The previous record of 39 glasses was made in 2007 by a Filipino man in a Barcelona restaurant.
