They are two titans of technology, locked in a bitter gadget war for the coveted title of the world's best smartphone.

But Apple's iPhone and Google's Android software appear to be neck and neck, according to an incredible set of satellite pictures that chart their use across America's biggest cities.

The maps, which use geo-located tweets and the cell phone metadata attached to them, show who is using iPhones and who is using Androids.

Scientists analyzed around three billion geo-tagged tweets over a period of two years and plotted the maps, using red dots for iPhones and green dots for Android.

New York: The red dots represent iPhones, the green dots represent Android and the purple dots represent Blackberries

Washington DC: The maps, which use geo-located tweets and the cell phone metadata attached to them, show who is using iPhones and who is using Androids

Chicago: The maps reveal that the iPhone are overwhelmingly used in the most densely-populated urban areas while the Android is more popular in the suburbs

Developed by Gnip, MapBox and tech-data expert Eric Fischer, the maps reveal that the iPhone are overwhelmingly used in the most densely-populated urban areas while the Android is more popular in the suburbs.

Mapbox CEO Eric Gundersen said: 'The patterns of usage in each city often reflect economic 
stratification.

'For example iPhones, in red, are predominantly in 
wealthy sections of the city while Android phones, in green, have more 
coverage in poorer sections.

'On a global level, national trends reveal a
 complicated set of cultural preferences.'

It comes two years after late Apple boss Steve Jobs pledged to use his 'last dying breath' to destroy Google's Android phone because he believed it was based on stolen iPhone technology.

Revealed in an advanced copy of the Apple co-founder's authorised biography, he branded it 'grand theft Android' and promised to spend all his company's money to wreck them.

Mr Jobs, who died earlier this month, vowed 'thermonuclear war' and said that he would not accept any compensation because all he wanted was the company ruined.

Apple has embarked on a war against Android, suing companies who have adopted the software for their phones or tablets.

'I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,' he said.

'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.'

Jakarta: But it is a different story in other countries around the world such as in Jakarta, India, where people prefer to use Blackberries

The rant in the book provides insight into the unravelling of Jobs' relationship with Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and an Apple board member from 2006 to 2009.

Jobs was livid in January 2010 when HTC introduced an Android phone that boasted many of the popular features of the iPhone.

Apple sued, and Jobs went on an expletive-filled rant at Google's actions.

In a subsequent meeting with Schmidt at a Palo Alto cafe, Jobs told Schmidt that he wasn't interested in settling the lawsuit, the book says.

'I don't want your money. If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it. I've got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that's all I want.'
