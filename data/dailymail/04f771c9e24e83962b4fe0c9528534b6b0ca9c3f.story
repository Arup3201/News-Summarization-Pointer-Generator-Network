The ex-wife of a software entrepreneur claims he conned her out of an equal share of his £150million fortune.

Alison Sharland, 46, says she was misled by ex-husband Charlie, 53, about the value of his business when they divorced last year after 17 years together.

At the time she accepted a £10million settlement – but now wants the case reopened so she can get a larger settlement.

The Court of Appeal heard the 
self-made millionaire claimed his shares were worth £7million, whereas 
press reports suggested the company could be floated on the stockmarket 
for more than £460million.

Mrs
 Sharland’s barrister, Patrick Chamberlayne QC, said the couple had been
 equal partners in the marriage and that the divorce settlement was 
supposed to be the same.

‘She was cheated into an agreement,’ said the 
QC. ‘If someone dupes you into a deal, why should you be held to a deal?

‘This
 was a case of equality. It was a long marriage. All the assets had been
 acquired during the course of the marriage and each party had made 
their full contribution.

‘Part
 of the wife’s case was that she was busy making post-separation efforts
 as well. She had the unusual task of lifelong care of the parties’ 
disabled child.’

The couple,
 who lived in Wilmslow, Cheshire, married in 1993 and had built a 
substantial fortune before separating in 2010. Mr Sharland ran his 
company, Appsense, from a business park in Daresbury, near Warrington, 
while Mrs Sharland ran an autism charity.

On
 divorce, they agreed the assets should be split equally, but the couple
 came to legal blows over the valuation of Mr Sharland’s shares in his 
business.

Accountants for Mrs Sharland valued them at £32million, but those working for her husband said they were worth just £7million.

During
 divorce proceedings last year they agreed to compromise, with Mrs 
Sharland giving up her claim to an equal share of the firm.

She
 received £10.4million in cash and property and agreed to take only 30 
per cent of the proceeds from shares when they were put on the 
stockmarket.

Mr Chamberlayne said she based her agreement on the value 
of the shares being worth no more than £32million and that the company 
would not be floated for up to seven years.

But
 it soon emerged that Mr Sharland was already in the process of floating
 the company. With an estimated value of more than £460million, it would
 mean Mr Sharland’s shares were worth at least £132million after tax, 
the QC explained. Mrs Sharland took her case to the Court of Appeal 
after family judge, Sir Hugh Bennett, despite finding Mr Sharland’s 
evidence to have been ‘dishonest’, refused to reopen his ex-wife’s 
financial claims.

Mr 
Sharland does not dispute that he misled his ex-wife, but says the final
 order made by Sir Hugh was a fair one and should stand.

A judgment will be made next year.
