Britain was basked in a glorious orange sunset this afternoon on the shortest day of the year with darkness setting in shortly before 4pm. 

The Winter Solstice - the day of the year during which earth is learning furthest from the sun - was heralded with stunning amber and pink skies across much of the country. 

But following a day of dry, mild weather, hopes for a white Christmas have been dashed by forecasters who predict light showers and minimum temperatures of 0C on December 25. 

Those hoping for widespread snow will be disappointed, say experts, with the Scottish hills and North Yorkshire Moors the only places likely to see snowfall.

The Winter Solstice marks the shortest day of the year when earth is leaning furthest from the sun. In Ellerton, York, bright amber hues set over a rural landscape 

'Those hoping for a white Christmas will be disappointed.Snow is most likely in higher ground, such as the Grampian Mountains, and possibly the North Yorkshire Moors, but any snow or sleet will be light and patchy and is unlikely to settle.

'For the rest of the country, most areas will be dry and bright on Christmas Day with temperatures of 6C to 7C in England and 5 to 6C in Scotland,' said Met Office forecaster Emma Corrigan. 

Light rain and heavy clouds are expected across central and southern England and Wales tomorrow, with mild temperatures expected to remain in the low teens. 

'The north of England, Ireland and southern Scotland will be windy and wet with heavy rain at times. It will also be mild with temperatures of 10C to 12C,' added Miss Corrigan. 

'Northern Scotland will be colder, between 7C and 8C, and bright and clear with the odd snow or sleet shower, though most areas will have rain instead.'

On Christmas Eve however much of the north of England will be showered with rain, with frost expected on the ground on Christmas morning. 

Brighter conditions were seen over the Cambridgeshire Fens near Ely. Temperatures across the region were mild, remaining in the low teens

Orange and yellow skies were also seen in the area shortly before 4pm today when the sun set across the UK marking the start of longer days

In parts of Scotland temperatures are expected to drop as low as -1C with clear skies and crisp sunshine expected throughout the day.  

If there is to be any snow it will likely fall on Boxing Day, she added. 

The last time Britain was blanketed in snow on Christmas morning was in 2010, with 83 per cent of the Met Office's weather stations recording snowfall across the country. 

Wintry weather is more likely between January and March. 

Despite recent forecasts, scores of revellers donned festive hats and swimming costumes to take a frosty dip in the North Atlantic.
