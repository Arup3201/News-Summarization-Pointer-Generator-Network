A 15-year-old boy has been charged with shooting a seven-month pregnant teenager who lost her unborn son following the attack last month.

Eric Taylor, of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, was arrested yesterday in connection with the shooting of 15-year-old DaRae Delgado.

The teenager was gunned down by someone who knocked on the door of her family's home and then opened fire on the expecting mother after covering the peephole with their hand.

The teenager's baby boy, who she planned to call Darren, died after an emergency C-section but Delgado is expected to survive.

Taylor is now facing criminal homicide and other charges in connection with the shooting.

Delgado's mother told local media that she knows Taylor's family and is shocked.

Authorities say Taylor will be charged as an adult. He was being held in the Allegheny County Jail on charges related to another shooting at the time of his arrest.

No attorney was listed on court papers. A hearing is scheduled for June 18.

Tragedy unfolded at around 12.35am on Monday, May 26, when someone knocked on the door of the Delgado family's home in Duquesne.

DaRae, who goes by nickname the 'Cara' on Facebook, opened the door and was shot four times, including twice in the stomach. The gunman then fled the scene on foot.

Deanna Weems, the victim’s mother, said she heard her son call out his sister's name after shots rang out and ran to the foyer, where she found the 15-year-old girl laying on her side and bleeding profusely.

The mother-to-be was rushed to UPMC Mercy Hospital, where doctors attempted to save her baby, but to no avail.

Relatives said despite her young age, DaRae was excited about becoming a mother. The baby's teenage father, Donald Crawford, was devastated by their loss.

‘I never got to feel him grip my hand, never got to hear him cry,’ Crawford told KDKA.
