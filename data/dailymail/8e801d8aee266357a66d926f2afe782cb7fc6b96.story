Earlier this week US confectionery giant Hershey's declared legal war on its British counterpart for allegedly making their goods too similar to those favoured by American consumers.

If successful, the bid would strip British specialist stores such as Tea & Sympathy and Myers Of Keswick, in New York's West Village, of one of their key selling points.

It comes years after rumours swirled of an attempted takeover of the British go-to brand Cadbury by Hershey's owner Kraft Foods.  

American favourite: US confectioners Hershey's have launched a legal bid to remove Cadbury's products 

Best of British: Fans of the Cadbury's Dairy Milk in America complained, saying they preferred the UK treat to home-grown alternatives

The two companies quietly reached a deal in 1988 allowing the production of Dairy Milk and other British treats with slight tweaks to recipes and packaging. 

In recent weeks British consumers have also protested at alleged plans of Cadbury's US owners to change the Creme Egg recipe. 

Mondelez changed the recipe for the sweet fondant-filled snack so that the shell is made from a 'standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate' instead of the popular Cadbury Dairy Milk. 

Critics also complained over plans to remove one of the eggs from the standard pack of six.  

But while Hershey's claims allege harmful similarities between the two, subtle discrepancies between the two recipes mean the American and British chocolates are in fact markedly different. 

With British standards requiring products to contain at least 20 per cent cocoa solids to be categorised as chocolate, its regarded as more delicious across the world. 

US: 10 per cent cocoa solids

Britain: 20 per cent cocoa solids

US: South American beans

Britain: West African beans

US: Some goods contain the additive PGPR used as cheaper cocoa butter alternative

Generally, ingredients found in American chocolate bars are cheaper than those in British counterparts.  

Indeed when news of Hershey's legal threat broke, US natives were quick to jump to the defence of Creme Eggs and Toffee Crisps. 

'I'm a proud American but I hate Hershey's and have loved Cadbury's since I was a kid,' one Twitter user said, while another described the home-grown alternative as 'pure garbage'. 

Many chalk the more bitter taste of Hershey's down to food industry rules which mean only 10 per cent of its famous kisses need to be of pure cocoa solids for it to be considered chocolate.

While only 11 per cent of Hershey's bars is made of cocoa, it makes up almost a quarter of a bar of Dairy Milk. 

Another reason for varying tastes is the source of each's beans. 

Most companies keep their recipes closely under wraps, though it's understood American confectioners prefer South American beans while the British tend to opt for those grown in West Africa. 

A fundamental difference in taste stems from where cocoa beans are sourced, with British brands opting for West African produce while US companies pluck from the fields of South America
