For the second year running a charity dedicated to supporting returned servicemen and women has enlisted the help of dozens of celebrities for a unique campaign. 

But for Australian country singer Samantha McClymont, the Take A Seat for Legacy initiative holds a very special significance.

While performing for the troops in Iraq with her two sisters Brooke and Mollie as their band The McClymonts, Samantha had the experience of a lifetime, as well as a little extra something else she hadn't quite bargained for.

Australian country singer Samantha McClymont met her future husband Ben Poxon while touring Iraq with her band The McClymonts over the Christmas period in 2006

When the singers were invited to see the inside of one of the planes they were travelling around Iraq in, Samantha had no idea that all these years later she would be walking down the aisle with one of the men she met.

'Being the Captain of the plane he actually invited the singers up to the front, he was pulling all the moves out,' the singer told Daily Mail Australia.

Over the 20-day tour of Iraq, where the trio played a concert every day or two, Samantha got to know many of the troops well, but she had a special connection with Wing Commander Ben Poxon.

Ben is Executive Officer of number 84 Wing, a pilot who flies the C130J Hercules.

'We actually didn't meet up until about eight months later, and then once we did it was kind of like - that was it!' Samantha said.

'I was down in Sydney and he took me on a date and we were pretty much inseparable after that. 

This year Samantha is involved in the Take A Seat For Legacy campaign, and has decorated her own chair which will be auctioned off this week

The three sisters spent 20 days performing in Iraq at the end of 2006

'It's kinda crazy that we met all these people and soon they'd be in our circle of friends and then coming to our wedding!' the country singer revealed.

Speaking of her own experience in the war-torn region in 2006, Samantha said as she was only 21 at the time so the seriousness of the situation didn't really sink in until she was back home. 

'You're wearing camo and bullet proof vests and helmets ... But you block it out so you can have a good time, and you want them to have a good time while you're there as well,' she said speaking of the troops.

Samantha also revealed how her time travelling Iraq helped her put things in perspective.

'They're going through this every day, we only had to do it for 20,' she said.

'It's a pretty full-on experience, and bombs do go off there ... but you put them out of your mind.'

The McClymonts have also returned overseas for more performances in East Timor since then

The ARIA award winner also said that what she saw improved her relationship with Ben infinitely.

'I think it helped our relationship down the track as he's had to go back on deployment.  But he's currently at home ahead of their wedding in Tasmania later this year.

'It actually put my mind at ease ... I think if you don't have any picture in your mind at all you always think the absolute worst,' Samantha said.

Plus their busy careers which often take both of them around the world mean they're used to being apart.

'You wouldn't think that a pilot and country singer would be compatible,' Samantha laughed.

The Take A Seat Campaign campaign, devised by homewares company Temple & Webster, enlists the help of 40 personalities from around Australia and asks them to decorate a chair, which is then auctioned off with all proceeds going back into the charity. 

Legacy is particularly close to Samantha's heart, and she said she wanted to do 'anything I can to help bring awareness', but joked that the process of designing the piece of furniture helped her realise that she should 'stick to singing and playing guitar'.

This is the chair Samantha created, which will be auctioned off along with 39 others over the next week

Chairs designed by a range of Australians such as Socceroos star Tim Cahill, journalist Melissa Doyle and food stylist Donna Hay are being auctioned off online until Thursday October 30th

'I think the last time I used glue was in primary school,' the singer laughed.

The chair, which is 'all covered in music paper, like a decollage' has a lot of The McClymonts in it, with three red ribbons wound across the back to represent the trio of band members.

'For a touch of glamour we put a pair of red high heels on the seat', Samantha revealed.

Since 2006, the singer has taken more trips to perform for the troops with her sisters, and said some of the men and women they met overseas still travel to their shows.

'You kind of have that connection forever really, cause you have experienced what these men and women experience every day,' Samantha said.

The chairs designed by a range of Australians such as Socceroos star Tim Cahill, journalist Melissa Doyle, model Rebecca Judd and food stylist Donna Hay are being auctioned off online until Thursday October 30th.

They will also be on display at The Grounds of Alexandria until this Sunday.
