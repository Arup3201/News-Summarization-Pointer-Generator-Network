When Hannah Carr's parents noticed a bruise on their baby's neck, they could never have imagined what was growing underneath it.

The then-six-month-old from Hornsby in Sydney's north had a rare tumour the size of a tennis ball growing in the blood vessels of her neck. 

Her parents Amber and Peter were told it was a rare disease known as Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma (KHE) and just six other children were affected in Australia.

'When I first noticed it was the size of my thumbnail. I thought my husband was manhandling her – I told him to be more gentle when he was burping her,' Ms Carr told Daily Mail Australia.

'This bruise just didn't go away, I thought they normally clear up after a week.'

Following tests at Westmead Children's Hospital, Hannah's family were told their daughter would have to endure 12 months worth of chemotherapy in a bid to tackle to tumour.

'I fell to the floor, my legs gave way (when) they told me it was a tumour,' Ms Carr said. 

'The tumour grew overnight. I thought she was bleeding to death and it just kept getting bigger and bigger.'

First signs of the tumour was a bruise the size of a thumbnail on Hannah's neck but it quickly doubled in size

Hannah's mother Amber thought her daughter was initially 'bleeding to death' after the tumor in the cells of her blood vessels left a horrific mark on her neck

Doctors planned to shrink Hannah's tumour with chemotherapy and subsequently cut it out, but when they did an MRI they realised it wasn't a solid mass.

'It has tentacles that spread across her chest, it goes across a lot of vital organs,' Ms Carr said. 

'The chemo wasn't doing a lot, it was only slowly improving, so they added steroids as well. The side effects were awful. She blew up like a balloon and she was growling like a monster.'

The tumour reduced by 50 percent after nine months on steroids and chemotherapy, but then stopped responding to treatment altogether.

Doctors suggested a breakthrough treatment for transplant patients that had been used to treat this type of KHE cancer in America. 

As well as 12 months of chemotherapy, Hannah had to have nine months of steroids to help reduce the tumour - the side effects included weight gain (pictured) and mood changes 

Hannah had a port inserted in straight into her chest so doctors could administer the chemotherapy

'She was the first kid in Australia to have this treatment,' Ms Carr said. 

'It was absolutely scary. Doctors never said it was a life threatening thing - it wasn't like leukaemia when you had to pray they would wake up.

'But being so rare, it's scary because you don’t know how they’re going to react to the drug. She’s the first in Australia – who knows what side effects there are.'

The cancer treatment came just three months after another devastating blow for the Carr family.

Hannah spent the first three months of her life in hospital after being born 14 weeks prematurely.

She was an identical twin but due to complications prior to birth, Hannah's sister Sophie was  stillborn.

Hannah, now aged three, is taking daily doses of drugs and has monthly blood tests to help maintain the size of her tumour. It's back down to the size of a thumbnail, according to her mum

'Three months after we brought Hannah home she had to start chemotherapy. Everyone was saying what did you do in a previous life... we were devastated,' Ms Carr said.

'(The tumour) is still there – but it’s back down the size of my thumb,' Ms Carr said. 

'We don’t know how much longer she’ll have to take medication. We know in our hearts the tumour is still there, but we just have to work out how big it is.'
