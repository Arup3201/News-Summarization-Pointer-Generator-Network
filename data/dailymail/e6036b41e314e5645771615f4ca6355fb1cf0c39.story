These spectacular photos of the centre of the galaxy provide a stunning backdrop to one of Britain's very own natural wonders.

Taken at midnight as the clouds parted, the incredible images capture the 'gateway to the Milky Way' as it passes through Durdle Door near Lulworth, Dorset.Â 

The breathtaking shots, taken by astro-photographer Stephen Banks, reveal a striking contrast between the starry sky and the amber glow of the early sunrise.

The 24-year-old set his camera to a 30-second exposure time to capture the limestone archway, its surrounding landscape and ruins,

He also used a bright LED torch to illuminate the historic arch, which is one of the most photographed landmarks along the Jurassic Coast.

'I've never captured Durdle Door like this before and I've never seen a picture quite like it, said Mr Banks, who works in PR.

Masterpiece: The 24-year-old, known as DorsetScouser to fellow photographers, set his camera to a 30-second exposure time in order to capture the perfect moment

Clear skies: 'Luckily the fog began to clear as I made the descent down to the beach. Some mist was still present and, in the distance, the lights from a boat lit up the horizon,' said Mr Banks

'I walked along the beach and carefully lined up the light in the distance with the "door" of the arch.

'I drove through a lot of fog to get to this location, so I was adamant that the evening would be a complete write-off.

'But luckily the fog began to clear as I made the descent down to the beach. Some mist was still present and, in the distance, the lights from a boat lit up the horizon.'

The photographer, from Bridport, Dorset, said he was delighted with the result of his midnight shooting.

Skilled: The photographer, who also captured this spectacular photo of ruins, has been asked to enter his pictures for this year's Astronomy Photographer of the Year award

'With a 30 second exposure, this had the effect of making the lights look like the moon or sun rising, but you can still see the stars in the sky,' he said.

'I could quite easily have given up and turned back to Bridport that evening, but I stuck with it and was very pleased that I did.'

Mr Banks, who has taken the astronomy photography world by storm, has been asked to enter his pictures for this year's Astronomy Photographer of the Year award.
