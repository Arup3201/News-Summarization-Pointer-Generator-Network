Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Manchester United have won only six of their last 22 Premier League games against Chelsea.

Chelsea have kept clean sheets in their last two Premier League games at Old Trafford. They have not kept three-plus clean sheets in a row there since a spell of five between 1968 and 1972.

United have had a man sent off in two of their last three Premier League encounters with Chelsea.

The last man to score a goal in this fixture (at Old Trafford) was Juan Mata, playing for the Blues.

Angel Di Maria has assisted a goal in four of his last five Premier League games for Manchester United.

Cesc Fabregas has been involved in eight goals (one goal, seven assists) in eight league games for Chelsea.

Robin van Persie has scored six Premier League goals against Chelsea but all of them have come at Stamford Bridge.

Only 14 players have started for Chelsea in the Premier League this season, a smaller spread than any other team, while Manchester United have used 30 players in the Premier League this season, more than any other club.

Chelsea are the only Premier League opponents that Man Utd have lost more games (15) against than won (13) against.

John Terry should make his 430th Premier League appearance in this game; he will overtake Frank Lampard as the player with the most appearances for Chelsea in the competition.
