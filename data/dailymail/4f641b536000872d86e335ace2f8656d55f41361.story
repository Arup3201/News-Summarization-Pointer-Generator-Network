Malawi President Joyce Banda has denied calling Madonna a 'bully' amid claims that she had not approved a statement from her office attacking the singer.

The president is reportedly furious over the statement which accused the star of blackmail, demanding behaviour and bullying state officials on a recent visit to the country.

According to the BBC, the head of Malawi's NGO board, said that President Banda 'did not approve' or know about the statement which came from her office on Wednesday.

The latest development in a extraordinary war of words which erupted following the star's visit to new primary schools in the country follows a statement released by the singer's charity yesterday which accused President Banda of 'releasing lies'

The statement from President Banda's office had claimed that the 54-year-old Material Girl singer, who adopted two of her four children from Malawi, has failed to keep her promise to spend money improving infrastructure in the impoverished nation.

It accused her of wanting the government to ‘roll out the red carpet’, adding: ‘If Madonna believes she deserved to be treated differently . . . it is worth making her aware that Malawi has hosted many international stars, including Chuck Norris, Bono, David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville, who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature.

The statement added that Madonna hadn't been invited to the African country and accused her of exagerrating her contribution to the state.

It said: 'Among the many things that Madonna needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth.

'For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur.

Strong words: President Banda had apparently claimed that Madonna demanded special treatment on her visit to the country

'The difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher.'

'In the feeling of Madonna, the Malawi Government and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21-gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician, the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries, she automatically is candidate for VIP treatment,' the statement read.

'Granted, Madonna has adopted two children from Malawi. According to the record, this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord. 'It, therefore, comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act, prompted only by her, Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude.

'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous.

'If it can't be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. Blackmail is the closest it becomes.'

A 'saddened' Madonna had hit back yesterday with a strongly worded statement which accused President Banda of 'lies'.

She pledged to continue her work with the country.

She said: 'I'm saddened that Malawi president Joyce Banda has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths.

'I did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit.

'I will not be distracted or discouraged by other people's political agendas.

'I made a promise to the children of Malawi and I'm keeping that promise.'

Madonna has been a frequent visitor to Malawi in recent years after pledging to donate millions to set up schools, orphanges and medical centres in the impoverished state.

She adopted her son David in 2006 and daughter Mercy James in 2009 from Malawi.
