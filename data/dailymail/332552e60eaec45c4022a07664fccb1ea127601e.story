Tim Sherwood watched Tottenham thump Sunderland on Monday night knowing it was already too late to stop him losing his job as White Hart Lane manager next month.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy held a meeting to make it clear he has chosen to go in a different direction at the end of the season after what he sees as a failed experiment with his highly-rated academy coach.

Levy, who did not attend Monday night’s game, wants current Holland coach Louis van Gaal to start work after this summer’s World Cup, having learned that the 62-year-old can now negotiate a pre-contract.

After the game, Sherwood said: ‘I don’t want anyone to feel  sorry for me. You’d rather have a pre-season, bringing in your own players, but that was not the case for me so I’ve just got on with it.’

Sherwood, 45, who succeeded Andre Villas-Boas in December, is determined to stay in charge for the last five games of the season but refused to be drawn on his future.

‘I can’t comment on anything about my employment, you’ll have to ask my employers,’ he added. ‘You’re never going to turn down the opportunity to take that job like I did.

‘I’m relishing this opportunity to manage such a big club. My record is second to none here.’

Sherwood is likely to make a clean break from White Hart Lane after nearly six years with the club and try to get another chance as a manager. The former Spurs midfielder was brought back by Harry Redknapp, initially as a first-team coach, and then impressively guided the youngsters.

But just one win in six matches before
 Monday night, combined with Sherwood’s outspoken comments criticising 
the character of his players, persuaded Levy to go for more experience.

Van
 Gaal was always his first choice, but has been waiting to decide his 
future while there were rumours that Manchester United might part with 
David Moyes. The Dutchman accepts that will not happen now.

Levy has also kept tabs on Southampton’s Mauricio Pochettino and Frank De Boer, who has just won the Dutch title with Ajax. Carlo Ancelotti was another option after a rocky spell at Real Madrid but he is now closing in on a Champions League semi-final.

After scoring twice, striker Emmanuel Adebayor paid tribute to Sherwood, saying: ‘No matter what happens to the manager, I respect him.

‘He has been a big part of my life. When everyone forgot me he brought me back and gave me my life back.’

This was a damaging result for Sunderland boss Gus Poyet, who said: ‘I am the manager and I take responsibility.

‘Sometimes the table doesn’t lie. It would be a miracle to stay up.’
