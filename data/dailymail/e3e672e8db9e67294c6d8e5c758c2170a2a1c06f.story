Real Madrid go in search of consecutive victory number 14 on Saturday but they do it against Eibar, a team they have never beaten in the league.

Okay, so they have never actually played them in the league, but Eibar have to take every positive omen going as they go into battle in what looks like mismatch of the season.

The two sides’ only meeting came in the Spanish Cup back in 2004. Real Madrid beat them 2-0 in the second leg at the Bernabeu. But only after Eibar had held them 1-1 at home. The Basque minnows will definitely take that again.
