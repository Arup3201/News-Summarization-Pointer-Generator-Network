An American man caught with almost 3kg of methamphetamine at Perth Airport has been found not guilty of drug smuggling.Â 

Robert Dewey Henson was arrested on November 7 last year after custom officials found the drugs hidden in the lining of a suitcase in his possession.

The West Australian Supreme Court heard last week that Mr Henson had been tricked into smuggling the border controlled substance by purported British lawyer 'Roland Blair'.

Mr Blair had emailed Mr Henson two years prior to the incident, claiming he was entitled to a $10.5 million inheritance but needed to courier packages to receive it.

The court heard that prior to arriving in Perth, Mr Henson stopped over in Manila of the Philippines where he met 'Jana', who allegedly asked him to carry a suitcase of her personal belongings on the trip.

Mr Henson claimed to have checked the suitcase but not the lining where the drugs were hidden.

He also said he knew someone would collect the suitcases at some time in Perth and he would be paid $1000.

But despite his suspicions that he was being scammed, Mr Henson kept going because he was happy to travel.

The street value of the methamphetamine was between $1.2 million and $4.3 million.

After his trial, the jury rejected prosecutor Linda Black's argument Mr Henson would not have been trusted with such a valuable package without knowing what he was carrying.

Defence lawyer Henry Sklarz had argued Mr Henson was groomed by Mr Blair and never intended to import drugs.
