Her role as Lieutenant Uhura in Star Trek inspired the first black astronaut to fulfill her dreams of working with Nasa.

But Nichelle Nichols might have left to pursue a career on Broadway were it not for the intervention of a very unlikely Trekkie - Dr Martin Luther King Jr.

Although he's best known for his rousing speeches promising a future of freedom and equality for downpressed African Americans, it transpires the civil rights leader also had in mind a far more distant future.

'He said, "You have one of the most important roles, this is a first. It's non-stereotypical, it's brilliant, it's beauty and it's intelligence",' Nichols told Neil DeGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and broadcaster.

'He said, "You cannot leave, do you understand? It has been heavenly ordained. This is God's gift and onus for you. You have changed the face of television forever."

Now 82, Nichols 1966 debut on Star Trek as a black woman playing an educated character was groundbreaking for its time. It was the era of the Black Panthers, and of race riots in Watts, Newark and Detroit, as black communities fought to realise the potential of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts passed to enshrine equality in law.

But even with all the turmoil of the age, Nichols hadn't fully grasped the racial and cultural implications of her Star Trek role, still thinking of herself as just a cast member on the show. 

In fact, she had already decided to move on from the role and even handed her letter of resignation to producer Gene Roddenberry when she met King.

'I had been invited as a celebrity guest at a NAACP fundraiser in Beverly Hills,' she told Tyson, in the interview first aired in 2011 but still available on his website.

'One of the promoters came up and said someone wanted to meet me. He said he's your greatest fan ... I'm thinking it's a Trekker, maybe a child, maybe a young man.

'And so I turned and I see this man across the room with this brilliant smile, which you didn't often see on his face. And I remember saying to myself, 'Whoever this little Trekker is they're going to have to wait because this is my leader, Dr Martin Luther King, walking towards me with a smile on his face."

'And he walks to me and with this smile he says, "Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan."'

Nichols says King spoke to her about her role in Star Trek and how important it was to the future of the civil rights movement. He praised Roddenberry, the producer, as a visionary, adding 'we [black people] are there, because you are there.'

Said to be one of the first black women to appear in a major television series in a role not portraying a servant, Nichols did prove to be an inspiration to a generation of young people.

Mae Jemison, an American doctor who became the first black woman in space on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in 1992, has said she was she was inspired to join Nasa by Nichols' portrayal of Uhura.

And Nichols is also credited with having the first interracial kiss on network television, with William Shatner's Captain Kirk, during a 1968 episode of the show.

After Star Trek's cancellation after three seasons amid failing ratings, Nichols volunteered her time to Nasa for a special project to recruit ethnic-minority and female personnel for the agency.

She is credited with helping to recruit Dr Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, and United States Air Force Colonel Guion Bluford, the first African-American astronaut.

She also helped bring in Dr Judith Resnik and Dr Ronald McNair, who both flew successful missions during the Space Shuttle program before their deaths in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
