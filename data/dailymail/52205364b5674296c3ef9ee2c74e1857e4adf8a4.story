Two teams of cricketers brought a league match to an unexpected halt so they could catch a thief who had been spotted looting the pavilion.

The suspect sneaked into the changing rooms to steal 12 iPhones from the jacket pockets of players while a 50 over match was underway.

However, he was seen fleeing with his haul from Church and Oswaldtwistle Cricket Club in Accrington, Lancashire, by the wicketkeeper of the home team who alerted an off duty policeman who was waiting to bat for away side Haslingden.

The officer then rounded up his team-mates before they and the home team gave chase across nearby fields - even using GPS tracker technology when the suspect fled into woodland.

Police dog handlers were called in and - helped by the cricketers - officers arrested a man and recovered all the phones.

Yesterday, Lancashire Police said the suspect, aged 29, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was being held on suspicion of theft.

The incident occurred on Sunday as Church were taking on Haslingden in the Lancashire League.Â 

Play had already been stopped after a former club chairman was taken ill at the side of the pitch and taken to hospital by ambulance.

However, at 3.30pm, play had to be stopped again when the thief, who was initially assumed to be match official, was spotted prowling around the away team's changing rooms.

Sam Tucker wicketkeeper for Church said: 'We were playing cricket and we see this guy was sitting in the players area of pavilion.

'I assumed he was a club official of the away team, but he kept nipping in and out of the changing room.

'Technology is amazing, we couldn't have done it without the GPS tracking. I've never experienced anything like it on a cricket field before'

'I kept my eye on him and he made an exit. We chased him through the fields. There was tracking on one of the phones, so we were moving around following the GPS.

'Police had arrived and police dogs and eventually we gripped him. He didn't have any phones on him at that time, so we had to pinpoint where he had put them in the field with the tracker.

'Technology is amazing, we couldn't have done it without the GPS tracking. I've never experienced anything like it on a cricket field before.'

Graham Knowles, an opening batsman for Haslingden, said: 'One of the Church lads spotted the thief and our lads gave chase and they caught up with him in a field and retrieved the phones.

'They used another phone to track the phones with GPS tracking. One of our teammates is a policeman in Burnley so he led the charge. It was the first time anything like this has happened in 25 years of playing cricket.'

Lancashire Police said: 'A man was seen leaving the changing rooms and the cricketers chased after him into woodland.

'Police dog handlers were called to the scene and a man was arrested on suspicion of theft and is in custody. Inquiries are continuing.'

The stoppages caused the match to be reduced to 30 overs which Haslingden won by six wickets.
