Fabricio Coloccini was never going to get the Newcastle job, Mike Ashley will look elsewhere for his next manager after Alan Pardew decided to head back to Crystal Palace.

But it got us thinking… whatever happened to the player-manager? The man who would call the shots and occasionally turn to himself when all else failed?

They are a dying breed. Ryan Giggs gave himself 20 minutes of playing time for Manchester United at the end of last season – 20 more than Garry Monk afforded himself at Swansea in the same campaign – and you have to go back to 2000, when Stuart McCall led Bradford for two matches, to find the previous Premier League player-manager.

Here, Sportsmail has a look at some good and bad player-managers from down the years.

John Toshack

The past 40 years have contained not one but two Swansea surges from bottom division to top. The first of those was led by Toshack, who was so keen to get into coaching that he took his badges at 18.

Having enjoyed a stellar playing career that included a European Cup win with Liverpool, he became Swansea’s player-manager in 1978, aged 28. He led them from the Fourth Division to the top flight in four seasons, during which he actually scored the goal that clinched promotion to the second division.

Kenny Dalglish

The Liverpool legend certainly pulled his weight. He took over as player-manager from Joe Fagan in 1985 and in his first season won the First Division and FA Cup. Poetically, he also scored the goal that sealed the league title. 

He went on to score six goals in 18 games the next season (1986-87), but willingly sacrificed himself to bring younger players through and only played twice in the 1987-88 campaign as Liverpool won their 17th title. He made his final league appearance in 1990, aged 39.

Graeme Souness

Souness rounded off his remarkable playing career by turning out 50 times for Glasgow Rangers over a five-year spell as their player-manager. They won three league titles and three League Cups under Souness, who retained his fiery side in the role. 

Recalling a huge row he had in 1989 with St Johnstone tea lady, Aggie Moffat, he said: ‘My marriage had hit problems, I was living in a big house in Edinburgh on my own, I was getting followed everywhere, I was banned from the touchline. Then the tipping point came when we went to St Johnstone.

‘We'd been there earlier in the season and there had been an incident with the tea-lady. Then we went back again for a night game and there was another incident. The boys were cleaning their boots in the dressing room and she took exception to that. She stormed up to see her chairman and I followed up behind her. I had an argument with their chairman and I knew within myself that I was ready to explode.’

Glenn Hoddle

The first in a line of three successive Chelsea player-managers. Hoddle had been player-manager at Swindon in the early Nineties and took them to the Premier League via back-to-back promotions, including a goal in the 1993 play-off final. 

He followed promotion by taking the same dual role with Chelsea and in his first season led them to the FA Cup final. Hoddle also reached the Cup Winners’ Cup semi-final and signed Ruud Gullit.

Ruud Gullit

Iconic and magnificent as a player, Gullit was initially a success in management. He took over at Chelsea after Hoddle left to manage England in his first season won the 1997 FA Cup, even though he did not play in the final. 

In doing so, he became the first non-British manager to win the trophy and also landed Chelsea’s first significant silverware in 26 years. He was controversially sacked in 1998, with chairman Ken Bates reportedly saying: ‘I didn't like his arrogance – in fact I never liked him.’

Gianluca Vialli

Just as Hoddle was replaced by a man he signed, so was Gullit. He took over as player-manager with Chelsea in the semi-finals of the League Cup and quarter-finals of the Cup Winners’ Cup and he won both. In winning the latter aged 33, Vialli made history as the youngest manager to win a UEFA competition – a distinction he held until Andre Villas-Boas won the Europa League in 2011.

The following season, Chelsea finished third, which was their highest placing since 1970. Vialli scored against Derby in his final competitive appearance for Chelsea at the last game of that 1998-99.

Stuart Pearce

Responsible for one notable managerial mishap when he took his first foray into the business as player-manager of Nottingham Forest in December 1996. 

Having replaced Frank Clark, who had resigned, his task was to lift Nottingham Forest off the bottom of the Premier League. His first game was at home against Arsenal and he was delighted with his attempt at selecting a team, until his wife pointed out he had picked 11 outfield players and no goalkeeper. 

He was manager of the month in January but moved aside for Dave Bassett in March 1997. He played on for five more years.

Romario

A World Cup winner as a player, a politician and a general manager of a club who once sacked his old team-mate Bebeto – it is only fitting that the former Brazil striker will have held the player-manager role at some point. 

In October 2007, he was appointed player manager at Vasco da Gama in Brazil and scored 15 goals, aged 41. He then tested positive for a drug that can act as a masking agent for anabolic steroids, though he claimed it was for an anti-baldness treatment. He was later sacked over a row with his bosses about interference in team selection.

Edgar Davids

Davids was playing park football in London when a friend of a friend called and asked if he fancied a few games for Barnet in 2012. He became player-manager, telling Sportsmail that year: ‘I am not ready to stop. I might go on to be a great manager, but really I want to have few more games right now. I don’t want to be paid for this, not a dime.’ 

It was colourful. One afternoon, he sent his team bus to pick up supporters stranded on the hard shoulder of a motorway. He also gave himself the No 1 shirt, despite playing midfield, and picked up three red cards in eight games at the start of the 2013-14 season. He resigned in January 2014.

Ryan Giggs

The last man to try the role in the Premier League when he briefly took the reins from David Moyes last season. Garry Monk had a similar role at Swansea last season, but never played, while Giggs limited himself to 20 minutes in his final game.
