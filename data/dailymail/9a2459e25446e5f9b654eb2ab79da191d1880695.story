The ancient Egyptians believed that when a person died, parts of their soul known as ka – a body double - and the ba – a person’s personality - would go to the Kingdom of the Dead.

And now a tomb with a remarkable painting of the afterlife has been uncovered.

It dates back to around 1,100BC and was uncovered in Saqqara, around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry.

The ancient Egyptian afterlife is one of the earliest known recorded belief systems in history.

People believed that when a person died their soul known as ka - or body double - and the ba - their personality - would go to the Kingdom of the Dead.

While their soul stayed in the Fields of Aaru, Osiris - the god of the afterlife - demanded work in return for his protection, which is why you often see farming scenes inside tombs.

Statues were placed in tombs to serve as substitutes for a person. In order to reach the afterlife, a person had to have a pure heart as well as recite passwords, spells and forumlae from the Book of the Dead.

People believed that in the Hall of Two truths the heart was weighed and if it was lighter than the Shu feather, they could pass on - or be destroyed by a demon.

Mummification and the sarcophagus was a requirement for being able to access the afterlife and the Fields of Yalu. The 'opening of the mouth' ceremony was of importance as well as the presence of objects such as jewellery to keep a body safe on its dangerous journey.

The tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries, Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said.

Chris Eyre, professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool’s School of Archaeology, Classics and Egyptology (SACE) deciphered hieroglyphs for MailOnine and said that the guard's name is Paser.

While his name might be common at the time, he was of high rank, shown by the elaborate tomb and its expensive bright blue decoration.

The tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of the afterlife and several inscriptions.

It measures 12 metres long and six metres wide and was discovered by Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology. 

It can be 
dated back to the end of the Ramesside period, which is named after the 
eleven kings with the name Ramesses, who ruled in the Nineteenth to the 
Twentieth Dynasties.

Ola
 el-Egeizy, of the Cairo University said the tomb contains ‘very nice 
inscriptions’ of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the 
deceased.

Professor Eyres said that is 'remarkable' that the full height of the wall is preserved, which is 'very unusual' for this type of open courtyard tomb.

The structure was found near another one 
dating back to the same period, which belongs to the head of the army. It 
was discovered in the previous excavation season.

The tomb belongs to a guard of the army archives and royal messenger to foreign countries, Antiquities Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said. In this image, the guard (right) is adoring Osiris (left with the crook), shown as he is placing his palms towards the god. Offerings of food - perhaps loaves (which look a bit like doughnuts), water in a vessel with a spout and meat, can be seen on a table

The site, pictured, was uncovered in Saqqara, around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry

That tomb is larger but much of what remains is mud bricks as 'most of its stone blocks were stolen and many of them are in museums all over the world,' said Mr el-Egeizy.

Because of the blocks, archaeologists had long known that the tomb of the messenger existed, although it was not uncovered until recently.

One panel shows the god of the afterlife Osiris and with other figures processing with objects integral to the body's wellbeing for eternal life.

Another panel pays tribute to the guard in life, showing his three sons offering him items such as incense and a monkey can be seen, which might have been a pet. Hieroglyphs spell out the man's title as 'chief of people who look after writings of the army,' Professor Eyre explained.

Ola el-Egeizy of the University of Cairo said the tomb contains 'very nice inscriptions' of the funerary procession and the afterlife of the deceased. The central part of the image is drawn as if it were a shrine and bears the name of the guard - Paser on the bottom of the 'frame'. The god of the underworld, Osiris, is pictured on the right of the panel in a shrine and the guard is offering him incense and water

The tomb contains a brightly coloured painting of what could be the afterlife. The blue colouring was difficult and expensive to produce, indicating that Paser was of high social standing. Here, his charioteer brother beings offerings to place on the blue table, which is already laden with loaves, lotuses and a dangling milkpot

One of the wall decorations is drawn as if it was a shrine and bears the name of the guard - Paser.

Despite being an important bureaucrat, it is not known if his name appears on other contemporary monuments, but as Saqarra was 'excavated' by early Egyptologists in the 18th century, there is a chance that artefacts that fit with the tomb will turn up in museum collections.

'Once a tomb emerges lots of museums find they have a bit here and there - but Paser is not particularly well known at this point,' Professor Eyre said.

many tombs have images of processions which show family members carrying objects needed in the afterlife, such as intense and water.

Paser's brother, Setti, who was a charioteer, carries a teapot-like vessel containing water, as the ancient Egyptians believed people needed a clean heart to be granted eternal life.

A standard bearer from the army follows closely behind, although it is hard to tell whether the objects will be used to prepare Paser for his journey, or whether the scene is from the afterlife.

'The grammar of the inscriptions makes it unclear if people are dead or not,' professor Eyre explained.

'It's hard to know if this is a funeral of the afterlife. There's a deep continuity between this life and the next.'

Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt. Here, workers dig at the site of the newly-found tomb in the hope of uncovering fresh evidence of the Ramesside period

Mr Ibrahim said that the discovery of the tomb adds ‘a chapter to our knowledge about the history of Saqqara’.

Saqqara was the necropolis for the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis and site of the oldest known pyramid in Egypt.

The occupant of the tomb lived during a time characterised by great wars. Many of the events and instances of everyday life were carefully documented by scribes, including strikes by tomb workers.

The tomb dates back to around 1,100BC and was uncovered in Saqqara (marked), around 18 miles (30km) south of Cairo, according to Egypt's Antiquities Ministry
