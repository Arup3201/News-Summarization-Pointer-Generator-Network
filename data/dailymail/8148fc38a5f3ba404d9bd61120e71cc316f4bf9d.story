Flowers, dress, caterer and a priest brave enough to jump out of a perfectly good plane... that was the to-do list for daredevil newlyweds Jessy Schild and Ingo Mueller before they took the most literal of leaps into married life.

Love was clearly in the air for the thrill-seeking duo as they exchanged vows on board a plane and then jumped out of it from 16,000ft with the best man, bridesmaid and the pastor close behind.

Jessy, 32 and Ingo, 46, from Freiburg, Germany, then sealed their union with a kiss in mid-air.

Love is in the air: Jessy Schild and Ingo Mueller kiss after exchanging their vows at 16,000ft

After releasing their parachutes and romantically floating to the ground the happy couple landed to cheers from guests waiting to congratulate them.

Ingo is an experienced skydiver and president of the local skydiving club with more than 1,000 jumps to his name, but Jessy had to do a tandem jump with an instructor. 

Both were in their element though, and the instructor attached to Jessy's back came in handy when the pair combined in freefall for a smooch.

Jessy said the wedding took over a year to plan and the stakes were higher than most weddings when it came to the weather.

But she said the toughest part of the organisation was finding a pastor to perform the ceremony who was willing to take a leap of faith with them. 

'Ingo has been at the SkyHigh club for 20 years and is an active jumper, I have done many tandem skydive jumps so I came up with the idea of having our ceremony inside the aircraft,' said Jessy, who helps skydivers prepare to jump and edits their videos.

'For us a skydive was the best way to close our marriage. The biggest challenge was to find a pastor brave enough to jump with us.

'We felt super happy to jump from the plane as man and wife and to be able to freefall together with our bridesmaid, best man and the pastor was amazing.

'It was very cold (-18 degrees celcius) at the exit altitude of 4,700 metres but beautiful.'

While not worried about the jump, Jessy admits there were some shaky moments during the in-air ceremony. 

'We were more worried about the pastor his hands were shaking throughout the ceremony,' she said.

'At one point he was shaking so much he even dropped one of the rings, luckily we found it quickly.

'We were lucky that the weather was good enough for us to jump otherwise the wedding would have took place at the airport and we'd have done the jump the next day.

Ingo said his wedding day was 'perfect'.

'I was just so happy to hear Jessy say "yes" - it was a wonderful day thanks to all the nice people who helped make it possible,' the groom says. 

Oliver Furrer, who captured the couple's skydive wedding on camera, said it was a magical day.

He said: 'It was really something unique, I've been skydiving for many years and never seen anything like this.

'Despite wearing her wedding dress and having just had her hair done the bride seemed to take the jump well, she wasn't nervous at all.

'The pastor was the most nervous, he'd never skydived before so I think he was a little scared.

'With so many people jumping all at the same time it could have been dangerous, there's a chance people can collide in the air.

'But luckily the instructors were very safe and knew exactly what they were doing. Everything went perfectly.'
