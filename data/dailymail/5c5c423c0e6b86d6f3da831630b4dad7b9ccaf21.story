As most start the New Year trying to burn fat from their bulging waistlines, spare a thought for the poor people clearing the many tonnes of grease and oil millions of Britons poured down the drain this Christmas.

These pictures show the state of our sewers after the festive period - bunged up with solid grease while 'fatbergs' float through the sea of pipes under out feet.

Many will end up blocked, causing flooding on the street and sometimes leading to putrid water flowing back into homes through their choked sinks and toilets.

During Christmas British homes send 25 per cent more fat and and oil down their plugholes - mainly from their turkey and the trimmings -  a problem that costs water firms millions a year to clear.

Nappies, baby wipes and cotton buds thrown down the toilet account for a third of all blockages

On top of this fatty waste Yorkshire Water has said it has even found a Christmas tree down its sewers after someone shoved it down a manhole.

'You just won't believe what ends up in the sewage system. 

'We've even found a Christmas tree down there,' a spokesman said.

Companies say at least 50 per cent of all blockages they are called out are caused by solid fat.

Nappies, baby wipes and cotton buds thrown down toilet account for another third of all blockages.

Mark
Maclaren, Scottish Water’s Regional Community Manager for the Glasgow 
area said: 'There is a misconception that sewers are vast, cavernous 
tunnels but in truth the majority are very narrow pipes, of no more than
a few inches in diameter.

'It is very easy for these narrow pipelines to
become blocked, causing waste water to back up and spill, spoiling the 
natural environment.'

London clears a 1,000 tonnes of fat a year, costing it £12m in call-outs to clear blocked pipes.

Food
fat and wet wipes are the main partners in sewer abuse crime, 
accounting for 75 per cent of the 80,000 blockages a year that Thames 
Water has to clear from its 109,000km network at a cost of £1million a 
month.

'In around 1,000 
of these cases, householders literally get their own back - in the form 
of sewage backing up through toilets and sinks,' a spokesman said.
