Hundreds of loyal fans lined Blackpool Promenade to get a first glimpse of the boys at a special preview event held at the seafront attraction.

Directioners were given the chance to brush cheeks with Liam, Zayn, Harry, Niall and Louis at the exclusive unveiling.

A number of young girls were overwhelmed after meeting the pop sensations – shedding a few tears after landing a kiss on Harry.

Excitement: The wax figures are wearing clothes donated by the boys. Each figure cost £150,000 to make

 Emily Jenkinson, aged 14 from Blackpool said, 'It's so amazing! I can't believe how real the boys look - it's just like meeting them in person. I don't want to leave them!

'Niall is my absolute favourite and I took the best picture ever of us together, I'm so happy.'

Each band member gave two sittings to help create the figures. The quintet of wax figures, wearing clothes donated by the boys, sit casually together on a school-style double bench where fans can sit right beside them.

The figures are in Blackpool until 9 November before they go jet off on their world tour

A team of 40, including sculptors, moulders, hair stylists, colourists and wardrobe experts worked flat out for four months to create the figures which each cost £150,000 to make.

Matthew Titherington, General Manager at Madame Tussauds Blackpool said, 'We were overwhelmed by the reaction to the boys arriving in Blackpool. We knew they were going to be popular but the loyalty these fans have shown is incredible.

'The band's figures are here until 9 November so we hope many more fans will be able to make the trip to see them.'
