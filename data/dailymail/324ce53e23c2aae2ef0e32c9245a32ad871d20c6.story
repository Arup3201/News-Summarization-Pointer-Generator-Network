Alan Pardew has pinpointed Newcastle’s come-from-behind draw against Hull in September as the catalyst for his side’s dramatic upturn in fortunes.

The Magpies have won three on the spin going in to Saturday’s home match with Liverpool in front of a lunchtime television audience.

They were also live on the TV on Wednesday as Pardew’s young team made it through to the last eight of the League Cup with a shock 2-0 victory over Manchester City.

Papiss Cisse inspired a Newcastle comeback against Hull and they have been in fine form ever since

That came on the back of wins at home to Leicester and at Spurs, easing the pressure on the manager.

Pardew was the subject of fan fury ahead of that visit of Hull with many calling for him to be sacked after a winless start to the season.

But Papiss Cisse struck twice in the second half to salvage a point and so began United’s revival.

‘The comeback against Hull was possibly the turning point,’ said Pardew as he reflected on his three straight victories.

Newcastle have built a strong team spirit and will be hoping they can win their fourth game on the spin

‘We were 2-0 down at home on the back of a difficult run and a defeat would have been really tough to take.

‘Papiss getting those two goals and coming back to fitness gave us that boost we needed and we’ve taken it on into all the games since then.

‘Our points total is improving and we want to keep improving our position by beating Liverpool.

Pardew, whose first game in the Newcastle dugout was a 3-1 victory over Liverpool, added: ‘It’s always a great fixture and a tough game. There’s a certain romance to it and all makes for a really cracking game.

‘It was my first game as Newcastle manager and we’ve had some good ones against them and more than held our own. I’m pretty confident about what Liverpool will do.

‘I think I know Brendan (Rodgers) well enough to know how they will play, but I think we can surprise them.

‘One thing’s for sure - Brendan won’t know my team, but I’m confident what his well be.’

United will be without the injured Cheick Tiote but Papiss Cisse has a chance of recovering from his knee problem.

Pardew, meanwhile, has revealed that his message to the players remained the same during their recent period of struggle.

‘You have to be strong and be consistent with your players, whether you are going through difficult times or really good times,’ he said.

‘I can’t go bounding in this morning all happy and excited as if we’ve won the World Cup, we have won one game. It’s the same when you get beat. You have to have a consistency of what you are about.

‘We were planning for Liverpool from 8.30 this morning and that is how we work. Everybody else can say and do what they do in the background, we have to ignore that and get on with our job.
