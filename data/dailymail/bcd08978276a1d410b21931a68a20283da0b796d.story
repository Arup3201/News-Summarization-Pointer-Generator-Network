Prime Minister Tony Abbott was today forced to urge his colleagues not to topple him in a 'make-or-break' speech.  

'We were elected because the Australian people rejected chaos. That's why we were elected,' Mr Abbott told the National Press Club after a nightmare couple of weeks. 

In a message clearly aimed at his own party members, some who are scheming over his future, Mr Abbott said: 'It's the people that hire, and frankly it's the people that should fire'. 

The address - in which Mr Abbott sounded somewhat hoarse - was marked by a series of major backdowns.

Fighting chance? Prime Minister Tony Abbott's landmark speech today was marked by a series of major backdowns, including his paid parental leave scheme and his much-pilloried knighthoods plan

Mr Abbott today announced he will no longer be responsible for doling out knighthoods. He was ridiculed after selecting Prince Philip for the role

Mr Abbott's speech today was widely touted as a 'make or break' moment following a torrid couple of weeks, all topped off by a backbench revolt

He announced he was effectively banning himself from doling out knighthoods, handing over the responsibility 'wholely and solely' to the Order of Australia Council. 

He admitted he may have gotten 'carried away' with the awards system of knights and dames, which he himself brought back after decades. 

And his proposed paid parental leave scheme - which would have paid new mothers 26 weeks full wage capped at $100,000 - was scrapped after a lengthy period of backbencher moaning.

Mr Abbott instead announced the government will begin formulating a new childcare and families package.

And he assured voters the GST would not be increased without a 'political consensus' - name-checking all of the states and even Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. 

Mr Shorten's team have been gleefully capitalising on the Prime Minister's torrid few weeks, even distributing a game of bingo to reporters prior to Mr Abbott's speech which included known Abbott catchphrases. 

The prime minister has been shaken by a coming together of various blows in recent weeks. At the weekend, the Liberal National Party government lost dozens of seats at the Queensland state election and has likely lost its grip on power there. 

Mr Abbott was widely pilloried for knighting Prince Philip on Australia Day. And already this year he lost out to doctors when they launched a successful campaign against his plans to cut the Medicare rebate.

Leadership speculation has raged in recent days but Mr Abbott today warned that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past.  

'The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years cannot become the new normal lest Australia join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck,' he said. 

'He's got a tin ear. The captain's pick of Prince Philip was basically a fatal blow to his prime ministership. I think he's got until the end of this week.' - South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon.

'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people.' - Opposition leader Bill Shorten

'It's not just Tony Abbott, it's the Abbott government policies that are the problem. They have to reject the cruel and arrogant way they have been leaning on the poor.' - Greens leader Christine Milne. 

'We would be crazy to repeat the experience of the last Labor government.' - George Brandis.

'We can't continue as we are. We are getting bad feedback.' - Liberal back bencher Jane Prentice looking at the federal impact of the Queensland election wipeout on Saturday night. 

'The prime minister has the support of all members of his government, including me.' - Communications Minister and purported leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull. 

The results come as speculation grows that a leadership adjustment is on the cards, possibly reinstating Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to the top role

There have been suggestions that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull may be in line for the top job.   

Backbenchers began talking openly about dumping Mr Abbott as leader after the 'catastrophic' election result in Queensland.

Mr Abbott called an emergency Cabinet meeting on the weekend to restore backbenchers' confidence following the humiliating start to 2015. 

Some of Mr Abbott's closest allies on Sunday conceded party members were unsettled but insisted his leadership was not under imminent threat 

'A few anonymous voices and a couple of people who have been prepared to put their head up do not constitute a basis to unsettle a prime ministership,' Attorney-General George Brandis said.

However, opposition members have called for an end to Mr Abbot's time as Prime Minister, claiming his days are numbered. 

'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people,' Opposition leader Bill Shorten said on Sunday. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, has also been rumoured to be lined up for the job

'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told ABC News.

'This is catastrophic, unimaginable,' said another. And its not just Mr Abbott that some people have in their sights.  

Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was back on Twitter again berating the government for its poor showing in the Queensland elections.

'Shock turnover in Q'land outing okay government.. Blank check to nobodies. Can't ignore this a huge message for Feds. People have spoken!'

Earlier in the week the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day. 

The Sunday Telegraph reported that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed to the prime minister privately she would not challenge him for the leadership at this point, but refused to deny it may happen in the future.

Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign.
