Meet the woman who is paid to organise lavish proposals for partners willing to fork out thousands of dollars to pop the big question.

Samantha Davies, who runs a company called Unforgettable Proposals, plans out every little detail of a proposal anywhere in Australia and she prides herself on a 100 percent success rate. 

She says most men who approach her for help are often willing to fork out between $3,000 to $4,000 for an average proposal package.

Gold Coast based company, Unforgettable Proposals, coordinates and plans out every little detail of a proposal anywhere in Australia

Owner Samantha Davies says most men who approach her for help are often willing to fork out between $3,000 to $4,000 for an average proposal package

But the more extravagant proposals can cost anywhere up to $20,000 depending on how far people are willing to go to impress their partners.

'We did one in Sydney not long ago that actually started in Melbourne. The woman was sent out to get pampered and then a limousine picked her up and her bags were already packed,' Ms Davies told Daily Mail Australia.

'Her and her partner caught the plane to Sydney where they had dinner on a private yacht in the harbour. Then they went to Pier One under the Harbour Bridge where we had transformed the room into an enchanted garden. 

'He had spent $20,000 all up... that would be our most expensive proposal yet.'

Another recent lavish proposal involved a woman being whisked off in a helicopter to the middle of the ocean where a super yacht was waiting for her. 

'The helicopter actually landed on the yacht's helipad and she had no idea what was going on,' Ms Davies said.

'Her partner was waiting with a single red rose. They had a three-course meal with a private chef and stayed overnight before sailing back to shore.

'That one cost about $10,000 - they had unlimited French champagne and canapés... it was really beautiful.'

Ms Davies started the business of proposal planning 14 months ago and she's successfully planned 50 proposals right across the country.

'I was working at a five star hotel on the Gold Coast and was getting so many calls asking for help with proposals... arranging rose petals, that kind of thing,' she said.

'I started looking around to see who did it and couldn't find anyone. I started the business and within three months I'd left my job and I've been doing it full time since.'

Unforgettable Proposals has planned for people to pop the questions in all kinds of places, including cliff tops, private beaches, secret gardens and water fronts.

'We find out about their love story and what they might like... then we contact the suppliers to organise fireworks, helicopters, private yachts or whatever they want,' Ms Davies said. 

'Then we make sure we're on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly through the day.'
