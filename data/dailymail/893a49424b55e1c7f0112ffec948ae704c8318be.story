City officials say a woman who has called 911 thousands of times should be given a tax-payer funded home carer because it would be cheaper than sending an ambulance to her house every time she has an 'emergency.'

Martha Rigsby collapsed to the ground for the first time in 1977 and called 911 for help. Over a period of more than 35 years, she's phoned the emergency line thousands of times.

Despite the constant calls, Rigsby has insisted in court that she doesn't need an at-home carer.

Prolific: Martha Rigsby talks with her lawyer Vickey Wright-Smith in Washington, DC. Officals have filed guardianship petition to take over the medical affairs of Rigsby, the most frequent 911 caller in the history of the city

911 Emergency: Ms Rigby has called the emergency services around 7,000 times over a period of 35 years

Rigsby's constant dialing of the 
three-digit emergency number for help puts a strain on services that 
are already stretched to the limit.

City officials say Ms Rigsby should instead be given a tax-payer funded aide to calm her medical worries. According to the Washington Post, it would still be cheaper than sending an ambulance each time she has one of her 'episodes'.

In the past year alone she has called on 226 occasions and been taken to hospital by ambulance 117 times. 

Even the fire-fighters in her district know her date of birth and Social Security number by heart.

Ms. Rigsby has become the most frequent 911 user in Washington D.C. history and has been dubbed a ‘super user’.

Now city officials have met to try and figure out a way to curb her behaviour.

The situation has led to the first known attempt in the city to seek guardianship for a serial 911 caller.

The Department of Behavioral Health believe that Ms. Rigsby, 58, is bipolar and borderline personality disorder.

Hypochondriac? In the past year alone she has called on 226 occasions and been taken to hospital by ambulance 117 times

These are ‘uncharted waters,’ said David Miramontes, medical director of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department.

Public documents reveal not only the extent of her 911 habits and medical problems but they also reveal the concern shared by Washington D.C. officials on the impact of one woman’s troubles.

Despite being covered to some degree on insurance policies, she has an outstanding balance of $61,366.33 owed to the D.C. Fire and EMS for ambulance transports.

Each trip, over the last five years works out to be around $478.

Over the last two weeks, the D.C. superior court has been deciding whether Ms Rigsby is able to care for herself.

The city would like to see a health aide look after her and taking responsibilities such as filing prescriptions.

However it might still not solve the problem of calling 911 because the aide would not be a live-in carer.

Oh it's you again! The operators at the 911 call center know Ms. Rigby's address and even her social security number off by heart she calls so regularly

After a court session this week, Ms Rigsby seemed taken aback by a question about her calls to 911. ‘Well, I don’t do it on purpose,’ she responded.

According to testimony during the court hearings, Ms Rigsby’s calls follow the same general pattern. She feels faint and collapses.

About 40 per cent of the time, she dials 911 on her own. Other times, she’s out in the District when passersby see her fall and call for help, the testimony indicated.

About 55 per cent of the time, she refuses to be transported in an ambulance and signs a waiver allowing emergency responders to leave.

Court proceedings won’t resume until January, when Rigsby will have had a neuropsychological assessment, attorneys in the case said.

Several mental-health experts have already been called to testify.

Fear: Ms. Rigby calls because she feels she needs to go to hospital, but the real worry is that an ambulance could be diverted away from a call from someone who is seriously ill

According to court records, Abayomi Jaji, a psychiatrist with the city’s Department of Behavioral Health, said that Rigsby continues ‘to place herself in real danger of bodily injuries from falls under the claim of ‘seizures’ or ‘Narcolepsy,’ which have never been correlated with medical findings.’

Jaji also said that Rigsby lacks the mental capacity to take care of herself as evidenced by ‘almost every other day calls to 911.’

Rigsby first remembers passing out in 1977. She thinks the spells ‘could be stress,’ according to the examiner’s report.

‘There will come a time when one of these [frequent 911 callers] will call and they will cost someone else their life,’ said Jim Dunford, the emergency medical director for San Diego and a known expert on frequent 911 callers told the Washington Post.

‘All cities are going through a similar experience of how do we deal with this small subset of people,’ he said.

Officials with the District’s fire and EMS department have not done any studies of whether Ms Rigsby’s calls have led to problems for other callers, nor have they examined her financial impact on the system.

When Ms Rigsby calls 911, the reported symptoms ‘generally prompt the highest level of response,’ including the first available paramedic and a separate ambulance for transport, testified Rafael Sa’adah, the fire department’s battalion fire chief for emergency medical services.

‘Our default assumption must be that she is suffering from a life-threatening medical condition,’ Sa’adah said.

Although Ms. Rigsby has been known to paramedics for decades, city officials increased their focus on her in December after she called 911 and threatened to harm herself, according to court testimony.

Even after a group involving representatives from several city agencies suggested Ms Rigsby should have a home health aide or even use a wheel chair, she declined their offers.

Now she has an added worry – that the volume of calls might lead to criminal charges.

She has been handcuffed before. ‘I’ve been through a lot,’ she said. ‘I’m surprised they haven’t put me in jail by now.’
