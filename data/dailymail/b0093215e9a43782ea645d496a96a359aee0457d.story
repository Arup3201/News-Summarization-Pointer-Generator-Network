Idylls from across England, Scotland and Wales have proved the most desirable locations for home owners in a new report.

A compilation published yesterday identifies the North Yorkshire town of Skipton as the ultimate location, ahead of Newnham in Cambridge, Monmouth in Wales and Falmouth in Cornwall.

Judges for The Sunday Times's 101 Best Places to Live in Britain report said Skipton was commended for its ideal combination of low crime rates, top-class schools and great transport links.

Supplement home editor Helen Davies said: ‘The four places we have selected demonstrate the range of fantastic places there are to live across Britain.

‘Skipton is a worthy winner for this year but each place featured deserves its spot on the list.’

Nic Robinson, 57, who is the manager of Ken Varey’s Outdoor World shop, said it was clear why Skipton was the best place to live.

He tole The Sunday Times:  ‘It’s small enough to know virtually everyone, but big enough that you’ve got everything you need here. It’s got the best castle in the world, it has history and character. Oh, and it’s in Yorkshire.’

The places were selected for offering the best quality of life to the widest number of people, and combining desirable features such as a positive community spirit, good local shops, services and attractive outdoor spaces.

The south west and Yorkshire and north east regions each recorded the highest number of desirable locations in the top 101, with 15 each, in The Sunday Times report.
