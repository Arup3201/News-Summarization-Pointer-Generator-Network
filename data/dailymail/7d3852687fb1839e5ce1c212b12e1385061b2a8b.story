Jackie McNamara rounded on the Hampden officials for costing his side the chance of League Cup glory against Celtic.

Referee Bobby Madden made two huge calls against Dundee United when, first of all, he denied Ryan Dow a first-half penalty following a nudge in the back by Parkhead skipper Scott Brown.

The whistler then instantly dismissed Tannadice captain Sean Dillon for a dangerous tackle on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes, thus ending any hopes of a United comeback.

‘I feel frustrated and disappointed,’ said McNamara. ‘But I’m proud of how the players responded.

‘I thought a lot of things went against us today. We stuck to the task and went right to the end, despite the disappointments and setbacks in the game.

‘Decisions didn’t go for us and certain other things didn’t go for us. I can’t fault the lads for their effort and commitment.

‘I feel we should have had a penalty. It looked like a penalty, I’d like to see it again. The referee was very slow to make a decision, or not make a decision. But in Celtic’s case, he was very quick to point to the spot.

‘I’d like to see the challenge again that caused the damage to Sean Dillon’s leg. Celtic ended up getting a throw-in from it. Sean has got a bad gash on his shin. I’d like to see the incident again, to see if it was a fair one.

‘For the red card, Sean has given the referee a real decision to make. It was his momentum and pace, I don’t think he has gone in to cause damage. But he’s given the ref a decision to make and we know what happened.’

United midfielder John Rankin, meanwhile, accused Celtic of piling pressure on to Madden ahead of Sunday’s showpiece occasion.

Following the stormy Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila had accused United youngster Aidan Connolly of a ‘blatant’ dive to win a spot-kick.

That was then repeated by Brown, who also pointed the finger at Nadir Ciftci over a kick that struck him on the head. Anthony Stokes further spoke out by expressing his bemusement that Connolly hadn’t been retrospectively punished.

‘I think it did influence things,’ said Rankin. ‘It put pressure on the officials and I don’t think it’s merited.

‘The officials’ jobs are hard enough without putting pressure on them. They’re under scrutiny.

‘You saw it last week with us going down to nine men and people questioning the decisions made then.

‘There has been a lot of pressure put on Bobby Madden and his three officials this weekend with what they’ve been saying in the press this week.

‘I don’t think that’s merited and it doesn’t help. But at the end of the day we’ ve got to deal with it. We’re bitterly disappointed but we need to look forward to the Scottish Cup replay on Wednesday and bounce back.’ Tensions sure to be raised once again when the sides meet for the third act in what has become a four-match saga. For United, keeping 11 players on the park will be a priority.

‘It will be easy to lift the players for Wednesday,’ said McNamara. ‘That’s what we are in it for.

‘Had we won today, we would have got back up for Wednesday. So we will dust them down and see who is available. Paul Dixon and Sean will both be missing.

‘But the lads have another opportunity to put everything behind them. Hopefully there will be a bit of consistency in everything on Wednesday.

‘We defended well with both 11 and 10 players today. Last week, we defended well with nine players, as well. Hopefully we keep 11 men on the pitch on Wednesday night. It’s imperative that we do.

‘Up until the last third of the pitch, we competed well with Celtic. But our last pass just wasn’t there, although we had opportunities to create something. It’s just that little bit of quality we were lacking.

‘But they gave us everything and that’s all you ask as a manager. We can take lots of positives from it - they way the players stuck together, how they worked and didn’t give up right until the final whistle.’
