More than two-thirds of Americans reckon Barack Obama would deal with an extra-terrestrial invasion better than his Republican Party rival Mitt Romney.

The study for the National Geographic Channel found 65 per cent of people polled saw Obama as a safer option if intergalactic visitors do not turn out to be as friendly as in ET and Mars attacks.

The finding may surprise some, given 
President Obama's recent decision back on Earth to grant an amnesty to 
up to one million illegal aliens.

Part of the reason could be the boost 
given to the Democrat leader's tough guy image by the successful 
mission to find and kill Osama bin Laden.

In the 1996 sci-parody film Mars Attacks! Jack Nicholson played US President James 'Jimmy' Dale, who attempts to negotiate with Martians that surround the Earth in flying saucers.

The National Geographic study, carried out by polling firm Kelton Research, also asked Americans which superheroes they would call upon in the event of an incursion by aliens.

Just over a fifth (21 per cent) said the Incredible Hulk, 12 per cent opted for Gotham City's Batman and eight per cent would look to Spider-Man.

Americans believe sci-fi TV series The X-Files represented what would happen if aliens came to Earth more realistically than the large-scale attacks seen in Hollywood blockbusters like Independence Day or War of the Worlds, the poll showed.

The poll indicated that more than a third (36 per cent) of United States citizens - roughly 80 million people - are certain 
alien spaceship exist.

Of those who believe, 79 per cent are 
convinced the White House has kept information about lifeforms arriving from other worlds a 
secret.

If an alien knocked on their door, 22 
per cent of Americans would try to befriend it, 15 per cent would run away, 13
per cent would lock 
their doors, but only two per cent would 'try to inflict 
bodily harm' on the life form.

A total of 55 per cent of people surveyed said there are real-life
Men in Black-style agents who threaten people who spot Unidentified Flying Objects.

In total, 17 per cent of Americans did not believe in UFOs, 36 per cent thought they do exist, and 48 per cent were unsure.

The survey was commissioned for a forthcoming National Geographic Channel series called Chasing UFOs.
