Four people have been arrested by police investigating the execution-style killings of Briton Mark De Salis and his New Zealand girlfriend Lynn Howie in Libya, according to a local newspaper report.

News of the arrests were reported in Libya Alhurra, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was not able to confirm the development.

The pair were shot at a remote spot on the coast about 50 miles west of the capital Tripoli.

Photographs posted on Facebook show Mr
 De Salis and his 47-year-old companion face down on the sand with a 
picnic blanket, food and drink next to them.

Detectives are believed to have found tyre tracks near the scene.

Friends of the dead woman confirmed she and Mr De Salis were romantically involved.

Police
 sources said yesterday it was possible the presence of an unmarried 
couple in the area had outraged extremist Muslims who might have 
followed them to the beach.

Execution-style killings are not unknown in such circumstances.

A friend, who wished to remain anonymous, said Miss Howie had gone to Libya to see ‘her boyfriend’.

She added: ‘We always said to her, “What a place to be in love with somebody”.’

The couple were believed to have met in New Zealand last year through mutual friends.

They
 were reported missing by friends in Sabratha city, where Mr De Salis 
worked and where their bodies were found by police on Thursday.

Another
 friend confirmed that Miss Howie was planning to continue on to London 
after first meeting up with Mr De Salis in Libya for a short break.

‘She
 wasn’t even supposed to be there for long,’ said the friend. ‘She was a
 beautiful person. She was hard-working and just lots of fun.

‘She lived life to the fullest, so it didn’t surprise me that she was going to Libya.’

According
 to reports in New Zealand, Miss Howie was formerly known as Lynn Gray, 
and recently divorced from an army officer. She had two sons - both aged
 in their early teens.

Friends
 of Miss Howie, who was studying nursing and also served as a volunteer 
paramedic, also told how the couple had been looking forward to starting
 a new life together.

In the
 days before her death Miss Howie had written on Facebook about her 
trip, describing it as an 'amazing experience', and a contrast from her 
homeland.

'Experienced the first of the machine gun fire last night, tonight should be interesting...New Years Libyan style,' she posted.

Mr De Salis, previously a flight lieutenant in the RAF, had been 
working as a manager at an engineering company servicing the oil 
industry at the time of his death.

Gwyn
 Rees, who served with Mr De Salis in Bosnia in 1992, told One News: 'In
 the time I knew him, he was always interested in bettering the people 
around him and doing the best he could for people in awkward situations 
and hard circumstances.'

The
 authorities have not ruled out robbery as the motive for the attack, 
despite a rucksack and other belongings being left untouched.

Both bodies have been taken to Tripoli for post-mortem examinations to be carried out.

The
 Foreign Office has called for a full investigation and Sabratha 
officials have sent their condolences to the families, adding: ‘This act
 is contrary to our morals and the values of our religion.’

Mr
 De Salis, originally from Sheffield, had worked in Libya for six years.
 He was the manager of the power division of First Engineering, 
transporting generators to Libya to provide electricity.

Karen De Salis, 48, is based in Cornwall, where she works as a personal 
assistant at the restaurant of TV chef Nathan Outlaw. She had returned 
to the UK from Libya in 2011.

On Saturday, Mr De Salis’s family issued a statement saying they were ‘shocked and devastated’ by his death.

They
 described him as ‘a decent and incredibly loyal man who was loved by 
many’. They sent their sympathy to Miss Howie’s family. Mrs De Salis has
 declined to comment on Mark’s death.

A
 fellow expat worker and friend in Tripoli told a Sunday newspaper: 
‘Mark was a good guy. He had no argument with Libyan people, he liked 
and understood them.’
