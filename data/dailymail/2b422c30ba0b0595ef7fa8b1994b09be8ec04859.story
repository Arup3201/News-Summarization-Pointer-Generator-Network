Shocked: Tory Priti Patel uncovered the figures and said it is an insult to taxpayers that people get these huge sums

Almost 1,400 Britons are raking in more than £30,000 a year in housing benefits, it was revealed today.

Taxpayers are picking up the bill for these individuals and families, with at least 100 getting in excess of £50,000 in annual rent paid for by the public purse.

A lack of council housing means that some are living for free in mansions where their neighbours are the rich and famous.

Tory MP for Witham in Essex, Priti Patel, dug up the shocking figures after asking a question in Parliament.

In the past year 1,380 Britons got more than £30,000 in housing benefit, and of those 360 got more than £40,000 and 110 were even given in excess of £50,000.

Working people would have to earn in excess of £70,000 a year to bring home that kind of income.

'Taxpayers will be appalled to know cash has been used to pay for housing benefit above and beyond what the average person earns,' Ms Patel told The Sun.

'It is disgraceful claimants are being granted homes at such a high cost to taxpayers.'  

It also appears that more people are claiming housing benefit as the UK slumped into its longest double-dip recession for 50 years.

Housing benefit claimants hit five million in the last year - up from 4.8 million a year earlier.

Next year the Coalition will bring in a housing benefit cap of £26,000 a year because of the huge sums some people are receiving.

But Labour are deeply opposed and said many, particularly in London, will become homeless because they won't be able to afford anywhere to live.

But the Government is determined to slash its costs.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'It’s unacceptable that people on benefits could be getting such high amounts of state support.

'The benefit cap will come in from April next year and will ensure that people on benefits can no longer receive more in state handouts than the average wage of a hardworking family.'

There have been several instances in recent years where properties owned by private landlords have been used to house families on benefits - at a great cost to taxpayers.

A mother of eight told of her ‘great’ life in a £2.6million home funded by the public purse.

'Great life': Francesca Walker received more than £90,000 a year to live in this villa, with neighbours like Prime Minister David Cameron

Francesca Walker received more than £90,000 a year in benefits to pay the rent on the five-bed villa, plus other payouts.

She insisted she would rather live in a normal council house, but added: ‘I’m not going to pretend this isn’t great.’

Miss Walker was housed alongside Prime Minister David Cameron, actor Hugh Grant and Four Weddings writer Richard Curtis as neighbours in fashionable Notting Hill, West London.

Her four-storey home boasts five bedrooms, three bathrooms, a double living room, study and roof terrace.

Speaking in 2009, Miss Walker said: ‘All my life I’ve lived in overcrowded flats on estates with gangs that kicked our door in and harassed my children.

‘We lived in some hellholes. One stank so badly we couldn’t use two rooms. Another had a gas leak that made my children ill.’

Miss Walker, whose children range from five to 16, was given the house because a new rule introduced by the Government in April forces Kensington and Chelsea council to fund suitable homes for large families.

None of the available council houses was big enough, so the local authority pays for her to rent from a private landlord.

Miss Walker admitted the move had caused ‘a lot of jealousy’.
