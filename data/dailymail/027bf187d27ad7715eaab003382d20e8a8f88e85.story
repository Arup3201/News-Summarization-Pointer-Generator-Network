Political power-broker, Gary Melius, the owner of Oheka Castle, was shot in the head by a masked gunman on Monday afternoon in the grounds of the famed Long Island hotel.

The gunman shot Melius, 69, through the eye as he walked from the castle to his car in what police are describing as a botched attempt on the multi-millionaire hotelier's life.

Melius was transported to North Shore hosptial in Manhassett where he is in currently in a stable condition and authorities are now examining surveillance footage from the Gilded Age estate on Long Island's Gold Coast that has witnessed the wedding of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner and closing scenes of Orson Welles movie, Citizen Kane.

Suffolk County police said that they responded to a 911 call from Gary Melius's daughter at around 12.30pm.

Kelly Melius rushed her father to hospital in the immediate aftermath of the shooting herself.

Gary Melius was in surgery at a local hospital, and had been conscious and alert before going in, said Suffolk County Detective Sgt. John O'Sullivan.

O'Sullivan said a call about shots fired came in around 12:30 p.m., and when officers arrived at the scene, they learned Melius had been taken to the hospital by his daughter..

He said that it does not appear to be an accidental shooting, but that neither the shooter nor a motive has been identified.

Last year, Melius was part of a controversy that resulted in the ouster of then-Nassau County Police Commissioner Thomas Dale over the arrest of a witness in an election lawsuit.

The district attorney found that Dale had instructed officers to arrest a 29-year-old Roosevelt man, who had testified in an unrelated case that he had been paid to collect signatures for a third-party candidate.

Melius, a supporter of the third-party candidate, then contacted Dale seeking to have the young man investigated.

The young man was arrested on an outstanding warrant while riding a county bus on October 5th.

An investigation by the Nassau County district attorney found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing but raised questions about the ethics of Dale's actions, leading to his resignation.

Melius was "alert and conscious and cracking jokes' before going into surgery, said Sgt. John O'Sullivan.

His close friend, former US Senator Alfonse D'Amato rushed to his bedside, later tweeting 'Friends, thank you for your kind words. Please keep my dear friend Gary Melius in your prayers.'

D'Amato was waiting to meet D'Amato for a meal at a local steakhouse when he was informed of his friends shooting.

'It was not a robbery,' D'Amato said after leaving Melius' bedside according to Newsday.

'It was an attempt at assassination. He was at the Castle, outside. Nobody put a gun to him or said, 'We want your money.' They just shot him. The guy had a mask on.'

Indeed, investigators are now 
examining Melius' political dealings in the hope of finding any clues to
 enemies who would want him dead.

Baffled friends have said that they are holding out hope that security footage will lead them to the culprit.

'I
 know that they have video,' said Steve Schlesinger, chief counsel for 
the Democratic Party on Long Island and a close friend of Mr. Melius. 
'But I have no idea what that video shows yet.'

Indeed, police have said that they do not believe the shooting was random.

'We have been racking our brains,' said Schlesinger to the New York Times. 'We can’t come up with anyone.'

A donor to both Democrat and Republican parties, Melius has contributed millions to charity.

Born in Queens, New York City, Melius began his career as a plumber, before getting himself into construction and property.

Becoming successful, Melius made a move for Oheka in the mid-1980s.

Melius
 lives on the sprawling estate along with his wife Pam and daughter 
Kelly and purchased the castle in 1984 for $1.5 million.

He sold it a few years later for $30 million but then regained ownership in 2003 - paying the same price.

In 2012, Melius fell into more financial trouble and was forced to 
refinance his mortgage of $27.9 million, though he told The Wall Street 
Journal at the time that business at Oheka was 'steady.'

Able to attract the great and good of Long Island to his lavish hotel, Melius hosts poker games on the property - attended by guests such as former United States Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato.

'What Gary Melius created at Oheka Castle is a classic Gold Coast environment for virtually every boldface name who walks on Long Island,' said Gary Lewi, the former press secretary for Mr. D’Amato to the New York Times.

'Literally, people from all sides of the political spectrum have gone through the doors to either share a meal, smoke a cigar, play a game of poker and leave their differences outside. He has created a gilded, neutral ground for people.'

Described as an 'up from-the-streets-guy', Melius' shooting has sent ripples through the Long Island political establishment.

Melius is almost as well known for his involvement with the movers-and-shakers in politics as he is for Oheka.

He crosses the partisan divide to boast friendships with Republican Congressman Peter King and Democratic Congressman Steve Israel - both of whom live on Long Island.

Built to resemble a French chateau, 
the 127-room Oheka Castle was one of America's biggest private homes 
when built for financier Otto Hermann Kahn in 1919, according to its 
website.

'At the time 
of its construction, the French-style chateau was, and still is today, 
the second-largest private residence ever built in America,' according 
to a website for the estate.

It became a hotel that has hosted the weddings of the well-known. Kevin Jonas of the Jonas Brothers married Danielle Deleasa there in 2009.

Former President Bill Clinton presided over the wedding of then-Rep. Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin, a close aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 2010.

Oheka Castle also been seen as a backdrop in a number of movies, television shows and magazine photo shoots, and it has been used for high-profile political events and fundraisers.
