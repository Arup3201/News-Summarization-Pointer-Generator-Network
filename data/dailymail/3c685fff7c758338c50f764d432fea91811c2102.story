A boy with an inoperable brain tumour is using a special camera to help him remember what he's been up to each day.

Jacob Tudor, nine, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed after suffering vomiting and headaches on a summer holiday in Cornwall last year.

His condition improved after a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the treatment has left him with very poor short-term memory.

He now wears a 'SenseCam' round his neck to help him remember what has happened throughout the day.

Jacob's mother Louise said the SenseCam helped him to recall events from the day before

It automatically takes 2,000 or more pictures a day, triggered by a change in temperature, movement, or lighting, or on a frequent timer function.

Jacob can then look at the pictures to trigger and reinforce memories.

His mother Louise, 36, from Westhoughton, said: 'Some days Jacob can do things and the next he can't. He will be doing sums one day, then he can't another day.

'It can be frustrating when he has learned things. He is very good with names and remembers things that were exciting or funny.

'He remembers what the SenseCam is. He keeps turning it to face himself to get on the pictures.

'We are extremely lucky. We have met so many other people who haven't been so fortunate.'

Jacob Tudor will use the camera on a holiday to Greece

Jacob's parents are planning a holiday on the Greek island of Zante this summer and they are hopeful and excited that the camera will help Jacob remember the visit.

The tumour initially left Jacob paralysed and unable to speak, but he is now able to walk with supervision and can speak again.

Westhoughton Rotary Club paid for the Â£300 camera after Jacob's parents, Louise and Dave Tudor, wrote to them.

A stroke in 2009 left the youngster weak down his left side and he is partially blind, but Mrs Tudor said he is a very happy boy who loves school, playing with Lego and tractors.

Doctors continue to scan the tumour every three to four months to make sure it is not growing.

Rotary club president Jim Yates said: 'When Louise contacted us, we were delighted that we were able to purchase this vital equipment.

'All of us hope that it will aid Jacob's recovery further and greatly improve his and his family's lives.'
