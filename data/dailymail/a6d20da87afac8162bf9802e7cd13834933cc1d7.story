It's a well-known theme tune that conjures up images of Lancaster bombers and air raid sirens.

So shoppers at a German Christmas market in Birmingham were left feeling confused rather than festive when they heard the famous Dam Busters theme tune being blared out at the carousel.

Visitors to the huge Frankfurt Christmas Market in the city's Victoria Square said the tune, written by British composer Eric Coates for the 1955 war movie, The Dam Busters, was being played there up to nine times a day.

The film, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd, depicts the daring raid by 617 Squadron on the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams deep in wartime Germany.

One shopper said he was shocked to hear the stirring tune as he shopped at the market last week.

'It stopped me in my tracks when I realised what the tune was on the carousel, and it put a smile on my face.

'Who says the Germans haven't got a sense of humour?  Either that or someone's taking the mick at their expense.'

Stirring stuff: shoppers at Birmingham's popular Christmas market were surprised to hear the Dam Busters theme tune as they strolled amongst the German stalls

The annual Christmas shopping extravaganza has been staged in Birmingham for the past 11 years and is now the largest outdoor Christmas market in the country.

Traditional German stalls offer grilled sausages, German mulled wine (Glühwein), pretzels, German beer and gingerbread, among other treats.  It runs from 15 November until 22 December and attracts scores of visitors to its nearly 200 stalls.

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, which organises the contract for the funfair at the event, said 'We do not have any control over the music the carousel plays.

'It plays a large collection of music from around the world.'
