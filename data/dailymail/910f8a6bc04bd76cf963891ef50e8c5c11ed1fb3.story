James Harding, the BBC's new director of news, told the corporation 'we don't punch our weight in current affairs', during his first speech since taking over in August

The BBC does not ‘punch its weight’ in current affairs despite employing more than 5,000 journalists, its director of news admitted yesterday.

In his first major speech since joining the corporation, James Harding called on staff to ‘change how we work’ in the wake of a series of recent scandals over its news coverage.

The former Times editor - recruited by BBC in August on a salary of £340,000 – said he wants his team to focus anew on investigative reporting, ‘story-getting’ and improving the diversity of its presenters.

Describing current affairs as the ‘backbone of BBC news’, he said: ‘We have a reputation for our commitment to current affairs. And yet, I don’t think we generally punch our weight.

‘Let me be clear what I mean by that. We’re a weighty organisation, and I’m very ambitious for our current affairs output. I want us to investigate, to analyse and explore the most significant stories we can find.’

‘How do we achieve that? The vital first step is that we need to be as sure as possible that we’re aiming at the right targets. That means shifting the balance between the time we spend researching a story and producing it.’

Mr Harding made his comments in a speech to assembled staff at the BBC’s London headquarters - New Broadcasting House - yesterday morning.

In recent years, BBC journalists have been the focus of intense criticism, starting with the failure of flagship current affairs programme Newsnight to unmark predatory DJ Jimmy Savile in 2011.

The debacle triggered a series of recriminations that led to former news chief Helen Boaden offering her resignation amid accusations of ‘chaos’ and ‘meltdown’ in her department.

In the wake of the scandal, Newsnight was again castigated for its failings when it wrongly identified Tory peer Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, prompting a £185,000 payout for damages.

Mr Harding called on staff to 'change the way we work' in the wake of a series of high-profile scandals over coverage, including the failure of Newsnight to unmask predatory Jimmy Savile in 2011

Its sister programme Panorama also came under the spotlight in April when an investigation into North Korea was accused of using students from the London School of Economics as a ‘human shield’.

Urging the BBC to improve the ‘diversity’ of news presenters, Mr Harding raised eyebrows with one example – Laura Kuennsberg.

Despite
inheriting her unusual name from a German-born paternal grandfather, 
the Scottish journalist – recruited from ITV to present Newsnight last 
month –can hardly count herself in a disadvantaged minority. 

But
it did not stop Mr Harding using her recent hiring as an example of 
what is currently being done to put people with a broad range of 
backgrounds on air.

Her 
name was listed alongside Radio 4 presenter Ritulah Shah – whose parents
are Bengali - and Today programme host Mishal Husain – whose whose 
parents are Pakistani.

He 
said: ‘We want the BBC to look and sound more like its audiences: while 
it’s been good to see Ritula Shah appointed to take over from Robin 
Lustig on the World Tonight, Laura Kuenssberg rejoining the BBC and 
Mishal Husain taking on Today, let’s be under no illusion that we are 
going to have to be very determined to address diversity on air and, 
equally, off it.’

A BBC 
insider said Mr Harding was using Miss Kuenssberg as an example of a 
successful female journalist, and wanted to see more women on air as 
well as people from ethnic minorities.

 

But Mr Harding warned his reporters not to lose faith in original journalism as a result of the scandals, saying: ‘Our response to Savile and McAlpine should not be that we shy away from investigative reporting and the coverage of difficult issues. In fact, we must renew our commitment to curious, inquisitive journalism in the public interest.’

Although he insisted the BBC is ‘the best news organisation in the world’, the news chief added: ‘The question is this: is it good enough? Do we break enough stories? Do we tackle important issues with sufficient impact? Are we keeping up with or setting the pace in mobile and social media?’

The BBC’s news division employs a total of 8,000 people – including support staff – of whom 5,500 are journalists.

Although the corporation does not release departmental budgets on the grounds it is ‘commercially sensitive’, BBC News is thought to receive around £500million of the licence fee every year.

Mr Harding warned staff would have to spend less in future as the BBC makes savings. He said: ‘It is unsettling and wearying to go through these rounds of cost-cutting. The reality we face, like so many other services and businesses, is that we are going to have to deliver more for less.’

However, he urged his reporters not to be ‘cowed’ by their critics, saying: ‘They say we are too big, too lazy, too wasteful, too left-wing – (a few say we’re too right-wing) - too monolithic, too insensitive, too white, too male, too old. And we have no business being defensive or, even worse, dismissive of such criticism.

‘We must, genuinely, be alive to our critics, but we must not be cowed by them. Ultimately, our answer to them is and will be our journalism.'
