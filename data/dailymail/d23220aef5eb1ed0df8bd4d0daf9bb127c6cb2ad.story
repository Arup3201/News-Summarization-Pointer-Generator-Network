Two Premium Bond holders have bagged £1 million prizes – but don’t realise it.

One of the winners is from Berkshire and only bought the lucky bond in May this year. The other is from South-West Wales and has held the winning bond for nine years.

Neither has claimed their payout, organisers National Savings and Investments revealed yesterday.

In total, £50 million in Premium Bond prizes remain unclaimed, including four £100,000 winners from Cornwall, South-West Wales again, Birmingham and abroad. 

There is no time limit on claiming prizes, so all the winners could still come forward.

According to the statistics from NS&I, the body that issues Premium Bonds, most of the big prizes between £1,000 and the £1m jackpot were won this year by people in Essex. 

That is followed by Surrey, then Kent, Hampshire and Outer London.

NS&I says this is because most of the bonds are held by people living in this part of the country.

One winner is from Berkshire and another from South-West Wales - both have yet to claim their prizes
