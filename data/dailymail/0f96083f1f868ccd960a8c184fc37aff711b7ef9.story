So much for being a two-man team. The Americans had talked endlessly in the build-up about targeting Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter, as if taking down those two would lead naturally to the Ryder Cup heading back across the Atlantic.

The wisdom of that theory was rather shot to pieces on a fascinating first day, as any number of fearless Europeans stood up to be counted to turn a one-point deficit at lunch into a handy 5-3 advantage.

An out-of-sorts McIlroy contributed just a half point and Poulter suffered a rare defeat, so to that end the American plan might be said to have worked.

Trouble is, when those two faltered, there to take up the slack was Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood and their wonderful rookie partners, Victor Dubuisson and Jamie Donaldson.

Most of all, there was the prodigious gifts and warrior instincts of Justin Rose and his Swedish partner Henrik Stenson.

Rose’s partnership with Poulter might have been broken up but the former is fast compiling a Ryder Cup record of which the latter would be proud. The two points he contributed on Friday with Stenson takes his overall record to eight victories from 11 matches spread over three Ryder Cups.

Rose is one of those Mr Dependables who could play with anyone. He has taken over the role of largely unsung hero Westwood used to play.

Here in the tricky breezy conditions he was immense and the competitor in Stenson rose to the challenge of being an able partner. Average by his standards in the morning, the Swede was at his awesome best following the break.

As ever, the first day of this 40th edition had plenty that intrigued and lots to analyse; plenty to keep fans of the sport and beyond in rapt conversation at the 19th hole.

At its heart lay an astonishing decision from American captain Tom Watson that sucked all the momentum built up by the visitors in the morning and left them crestfallen at the finish.

The story at half-time was that Europe had somehow contrived to lose yet another series despite winning one match comfortably and leading two more with just the final three holes to play. They would lose one and halve the other to concede the first series by a point. That took their record to two wins out of the last 12 series of fourballs and foursomes.

 Inevitably there were grumblings but any questions about some of the pairings and why a natural front man like McIlroy was stuck in the anchor match became a faded memory thanks to Watson’s howler.

Comfortably the best golf in the morning was played by the youngest American partnership in Ryder Cup history — 21-year-old Jordan Spieth and 24-year-old Patrick Reed.

To be fair, it was a Watson masterstroke to pair them together, for they didn’t just take down Poulter and local hero Stephen Gallacher — they wiped the floor with them.

The two rookies were full of it afterwards and rightly so. They were the talk of the Glen. The Americans present were buoyant. Who would the new American dream pairing be taking on in the afternoon?

They were benched.

Naturally, they could not believe it. Who could? They pleaded with their captain. ‘They’re very upset with me right now,’ admitted Watson. They were not alone, among those with American interests at heart.

And so the momentum shifted. Donaldson and Westwood were majestic in beating the noted foursomes players, Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar, on the final hole. Poor Mickelson, now 44 and with an arthritic condition, looked like a man who could hardly believe he was being sent out again, and played tired golf — who would have thought that? — in losing to McDowell and Dubuisson.

Even America’s only half point in the afternoon must have felt like a loss as world No 1 McIlroy and world No 3 Garcia came back from two down with two to play.

What a start we had to proceedings. It is an incredible logistical exercise to get 50,000 people on to a golf course situated in the middle of nowhere for a 7.35am start but the hardy Ryder Cup regulars, as ever, were up for it. The park-and-ride car parks started filling up at 5am and by the time the gates opened at 6am, there were thousands waiting to make the mad dash for the best seats in the 3,000-capacity grandstand around the first tee. By 6.15am, some 45 minutes before the sun started peeking above the Ochil Hills, there were no unoccupied seats at all.

Daylight revealed a magnificent landscape, with spectators occupying every possible vantage point — and soon the songs began. ‘Ten-six, and you still can’t win,’ was one chant, a reference to the epic turn of events at Medinah.

Bubba Watson was first out for America and when he cupped his hand to his ear the thrilled crowd knew what that meant. So it was he boomeranged the ball in trademark fashion to a deafening ‘Ole’ accompaniment. That, however, was as good as it got for the Masters champion and his hapless partner Webb Simpson.

A special reception was afforded Poulter and local hero, Stephen Gallacher. Poulter pounded his chest, the frustrated footballer to the end.

It looked as if the occasion was too much for Gallacher, while Poulter lost for the first time in eight Ryder Cup matches. 

Curiously, all four of his defeats have come on the opening day.

Just a minuscule contribution in points terms from McIlroy and Poulter, then, but no matter. To American chagrin, this was the day European golf displayed all its considerable strength in depth.
