A new backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases has been uncovered by inspectors in the latest border shambles.

The total – which is about the same as the population of Oxford – is increasing by nearly 100 every day.

It is made up of migrants whose visas allowing them to stay in Britain have expired and who have been refused permission to stay on.

A report has revealed the UK Border Agency has a backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases

But border officials have no idea if they have actually left the country or are still living here illegally.

And inspectors found the beleaguered UK Border Agency has no plan for finding out how many remain, or taking action to remove those who are still here.

In 40 per cent of cases examined by inspectors, the migrants had not even been sent a letter telling them they must quit Britain.

The 'significant' new backlog emerged in a report by John Vine, the chief inspector of the UK Border Agency.

The report, published today, revealed that in mid-December, the total number of cases in the Migration Refusal Pool across the UK stood at 159,313.  In the preceding two months, it had increased by 5,492 – or nearly 100 cases a day.

Cases put in the pool were foreign students or workers here legally who applied for their visas to be extended but were refused, and told they must leave within 28 days.

Immigration Minister Damian Green, pictured at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport, said: 'We are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the UK illegally.'

Mr Vine said urgent action was needed to tackle it because, currently, tracking down and removing such illegal migrants was not seen as a priority.'

'The agency does not know how many of these individuals have left the country or who are waiting to be removed,' he said. 'I also saw no evidence that there is a clear plan in place for the agency to deal with this stream of work to ensure this does not become another backlog.'

Home Office officials last night refused to say what the total is now, saying they would not provide a 'running commentary'.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the think-tank MigrationWatch, said: 'It is vital to the credibility of the whole immigration system that people who have no right to be in Britain should be removed.

'There clearly needs to be a much greater
focus on this. It is absurd, for example, that people who overstay 
should not even be contacted to be told to go.'

'I am astonished that the UKBA has no 
idea where 159,000 individuals – the size of a city like Oxford – have 
gone since their application was rejected.'

The report looked specifically at immigration officials in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, where immigration officials massively underestimated the number of such cases in their area.

They put the total at between 400 to 600 but the real total was 1,893, more than three times higher.

A detailed examination of a sample of cases revealed barely half were recorded as having left the country, and only one had been forcibly removed.

Others had launched new appeals or could not be removed because of human rights or legal barriers.

In 40 per cent of cases migrants were not even sent the legal letters telling them they must leave the country.

The report said: 'The issue is a national problem. We believe the agency needs to be much more pro-active in providing a clear strategic direction for its staff to follow. This should stop the already significant backlog from increasing and ensure steps are taken to reduce it.'

Immigration Minister Damian Green said: 'Under the last government there was no effective strategy in place to ensure migrants left at the end of their time in the UK.

'The UK Border Agency is now working through a group of potential over-stayers to identify those who have not left. We are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the UK illegally.'

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: 'I am astonished that the UKBA has no idea where 159,000 individuals – the size of a city like Oxford – have gone since their application was rejected. This is yet another group of cases we did not know about.'
