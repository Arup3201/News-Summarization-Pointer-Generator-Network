A ute illegally overloaded with 24 rolls of old carpet tied down with just two lengths of rope has been caught on camera and the footage handed into police.

A concerned motorist captured the vehicle on camera as it drove around Sydney with its unsteady heavy load covered with a black plastic tarp.

The images were shared on NSW Police's Traffic and Highway Patrol Command Facebook site on Wednesday, generating more than 200 comments many of which expressed outrage.

A ute illegally overloaded with 24 rolls of old carpet tied down with just two lengths of rope has been caught in the act

A concerned motorist captured the vehicle on camera as it drove around Sydney with its unsteady heavy load covered with a black plastic tarp 

One Facebook post suggested the picture of the ute was taken in Macquarie Fields, in southwest Sydney, while the Courier Mail reported that the vehicle was in neighbouring suburb Villawood or Kogarah in Sydney's south.

A motorist was clearly angered by the Facebook post and wrote: 'Some people have no idea of the rules or respect for others on the road.'

Traffic & Highway Patrol Commander and Assistant Commissioner John Hartley said such behaviour poses a threat to not only drivers but other road users.

He said it will not be tolerated and dangerous drivers risk three demerit points and a fine of up to $415.

'It is a significant safety risk for other motorists, where in recent years two motorists lost their lives when they stopped at a piece of equipment that had fallen onto a busy road and were involved in a crash with another vehicle,' Mr Hartley told the Courier Mail.

A report by the Traffic & Highway Patrol shows there are about 5.11 million licensed drivers and 5.84 million registered vehicles in NSW.
