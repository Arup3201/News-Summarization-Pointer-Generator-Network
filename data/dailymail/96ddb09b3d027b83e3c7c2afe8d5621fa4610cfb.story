Avatar director James Cameron is preparing for an attempt to be first human being in 50 years to visit the deepest point on Earth - the bottom of the Mariana Trench, seven miles down in the Pacific.

The director will start his attempt 'within weeks' - becoming the first of at least four teams racing to the ocean floor, an icy, alien environment with pressures 1,000 times higher than the surface.

Many liken the journey to man's steps into space. 'The deep trenches are the last unexplored frontier on our planet,' says Cameron.

James Cameron's team prepare Deepsea Challenger for its first test in the ocean at Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, Australia. In the coming weeks the submersible will travel to the bottom of the Mariana Trench

Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh emerge from the bathyscaphe Trieste following their successful manned descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in January 1960. In the coming weeks, 52 years later, explorer and filmmaker James Cameron aims to repeat the feat

The only people who have ever reached the bottom of 
the Mariana Trench were Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, who used the huge, 
blimp-shaped submersible Trieste in 
January 1960.

The director has just 
completed a test dive of five miles in Papua New Guinea, using his solo 
submersible Deep Sea Challenger.

Cameron had to build his own vehicle for the attempt - a craft capable of withstanding 1,000 atmospheres of pressure.

Cameron will be inside a pilot sphere
so cramped he will not be able to extend his arms.

He will be the sole occupant in a complex, 24-foot-long craft made primarily of highly specialized glass foam.

He will spend around six hours at the bottom, and will film the attempt for a 3D documentary.

Cameron looks set to beat rival teams to the bottom - his rivals include Sir Richard Branson's Deep Flight Challenger, and DOER Marine, backed by Google's Eric Schmidt.

A Florida company, Triton submarines, are working on a submarine that will take people to the bottom for $250,000 a ticket.

'I've always dreamed of diving to the deepest place in the oceans,' says Cameron. 'For me
it went from a boyhood fantasy to a real quest, like climbing Everest.'

'There is currently no commercial submersible on Earth capable of diving to the ‘full ocean depth’ of 36,000 feet. The only way to make my dream a reality was to build a new vehicle unlike any in current existence,' says Cameron.

A 'hydrographic' ship from the U.S. Navy recently mapped the Marianas trench from north to south using a 'multibeam echosounder', a standard device for mapping the ocean floor.

The ship, associated with CCOM, 
the Centre for Coastal and Ocean Mapping at the University of New 
Hampshire, mapped the whole of the Marianas Trench to a 100m resolution -
including an accurate 'map' of the deepest place on earth, Challenger 
Deep

Cameron is an 
avid explorer with 72 submersible dives to his credit—51 of which were 
in Russian Mir submersibles to depths of up to 16,000 feet, including 33
to Titanic.

The measurement - using echosound - of Challenger Deep, the deepest point of the Marianas trench may be the most accurate yet
