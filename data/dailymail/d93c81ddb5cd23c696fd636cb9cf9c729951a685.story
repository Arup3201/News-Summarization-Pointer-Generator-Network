This is the moment a London tourist bus driver mounted a pavement to block two cyclists in their tracks before yelling at them to 'get a Highway code'.

Ali Choudhry, 19, and a friend were riding through central London, sticking to marked cycle lanes, when they found themselves in conflict with an open-topped double-decker.

As they approached the Tower of London on Lower Thames Street, they were directed onto a shared pavement by the road markings.

Road rage: The bus driver confronts the two cyclists after cutting them off on a pavement in central London

Furious: During his rant the driver is seen telling Ali Choudhry, 19, and his friend to 'get a Highway Code' - after he had mounted the pavement 

Halt: The bus driver perches a wheel on the pavement and waits for the cyclists to approach the doors 

But the angry driver - who has since been sacked - apparently overtook them in his tour bus and pulled straight onto the pavement in front of them - stopping the pair in their paths.

He then climbed from his seat, opened the door and yelled at the two cyclists - telling them to 'get a Highway Code'. 

Mr Choudry, of Ilford, Essex, said: 'This idiot driver decided to spice things up a bit for us with a spectacular display of road rage.

'He tailgated us at literally three feet and got angry for being held up for a few seconds but had all the time in the world to stop and vent his fury.'

The incident happened at around 6pm on August 2, and was captured by Ali’s helmet-mounted camera.

'He said he had a bus full of witnesses, but I said my camera was a more reliable witness, and he shut the doors,' he added.  

Approach: The two cyclists - who recorded the footage from a camera attached to a helmet - approach the end of the cycle lane on Lower Thames Street in the centre of London

Turn: The bus begins to indicate left before a corner as the pair ride along the pavement

Blocked off: The bus driver pulls onto the pavement, stopping the cyclists in their tracks 

Mr Choudry has sent the footage to bus operators Golden Tours and is still waiting to hear back from them.

He said: 'I hope they do sort it out as best as they can. The driver really needs to control his irrational anger and what he does as a result of it.'

The Metropolitan Police have not been contacted about the incident and have not taken any action. 

A spokesman for Golden Tours told the Evening Standard: 'Golden Tours were notified of an incident that occurred on 2 August 2014 when a video was uploaded by Ali Choudhry to YouTube.

'After reviewing the evidence provided by Mr Choudhry and the CCTV footage from the bus, the driver was dismissed from his service with Golden Tours with immediate effect on 4 August 2014.

'Golden Tours employs a rigorous recruitment and training process to ensure that the highest level of customer service is provided to our customers and to other shared road users. 

'We are grateful that matters such as these are highlighted to us, so that we are able to maintain the high standard of professionalism.'

Confrontation: The driver then opens his doors and starts shouting at the cyclists 

Aftermath: Following the angry confrontation, the bus driver simply pulls away and carries on with his journey
