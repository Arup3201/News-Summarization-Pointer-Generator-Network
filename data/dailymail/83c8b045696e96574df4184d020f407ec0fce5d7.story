There’s a beautiful scene in Field of Dreams, a film that touched my life like no other.

In the scene, the main character Ray Kinsella, actor Kevin Costner, asks Dr ‘Moonlight’ Graham, played by the brilliant Burt Lancaster, about his short baseball career – one inning, he didn’t get to make a play, and he never got another chance. Kinsella wondered how that felt.

The Doc held his finger and thumb close together and replied: ‘It was like coming this close to your dreams, and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd. At the time you don’t think much of it. You know we just don’t recognise the most significant moments of our lives when they’re happening. Back then I thought, "Well there’ll be other days." I didn’t realise that was the only day.’

The dream is over: Steven Gerrard comforts Luis Suarez as Liverpool see their title dream slip away

Moving on: Suarez left Liverpool to go to Barcelona for £75m after the World Cup

I couldn’t help thinking of that scene when Luis Suarez move to Barcelona from Liverpool was confirmed last week.

That dream of winning a first Premier League title – Liverpool came close. And then, Steven Gerrard slipped, and the fans had to watch that dream brush past them. Will there be other days?

Liverpool fans seem to be putting a brave face on, showing faith in Brendan Rodgers, and after the improvements under the manager last season why shouldn’t they have faith?

There is a huge problem though: the best player has gone, and the second best player is a year older and ‘broken’ – his description not mine - after a disastrous World Cup.

Rodgers claims Liverpool will come back ‘stronger’ next season. If they do then this guy is the new Fergie in that he will have proved he can rebuild a side after losing a main man.

Fresh face: Rickie Lambert trains with his new Liverpool team-mates at Melwood

Right now I can’t see it: I rate Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana, I think had Lazar Markovic not been suspended, Benfica would have won the Europa League, and Emre Can has shown enough to suggest he has a great career ahead of him.

The talk of more players coming in is exciting for Liverpool fans.

The only problem is – none of them are on the same planet as Suarez.

Letting it slip: Gerrard fell over against Chelsea to allow Demba Ba to score at Anfield

Shattered dream: Gerrard looks dejected as he sees Liverpool's title dream slip away

I’m not saying it was wrong to sell: biting opponents is not the Liverpool way. I just can’t help thinking that in the market Liverpool are trading, there is no proper replacement around.

That slip against Chelsea, was that the most significant moment of Liverpool’s recent history?

Is that a moment most fans have failed to grasp the significance of?

That was the moment the dream brushed by, and although there is brash determination being shown by all involved at Anfield, the reality is they have just lost their only truly world-class player, who took them above Everton and United, to within two points of the title, to a place where they could see the dream coming true, and then had to watch while it shattered around them.

Dream over? Liverpool fans may realise that last season was their best chance to win the title

For those Liverpool fans the dream is alive.

For the rest of us realists, the chance of domestic greatness returning to Anfield has evaporated.

You don’t realise what you had until it’s gone. Some Liverpool fans, historians and experts were ready to elevate Suarez to a place among the all-time greats, some even suggested he could be the best player the club has ever had.

You don’t replace that kind of quality easily.

Rodgers has a chance to show how good he really is – it’s a fantastic opportunity for him.

But I can’t help feeling the Liverpool fans’ dreams of seeing their club return to domestic greatness just brushed past Anfield last season, and then disappeared into the crowd.
