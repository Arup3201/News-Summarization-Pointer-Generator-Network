If you’re trying to keep up with the Joneses, then there soon might be another must-have item to add to your dinner party woes.

Because according to those in the know, the humble salt cellar is falling out of fashion thanks to its more modern replacement – grated Himalayan pink rock salt.

Mined from Himalayan rock and supposedly the purest form of salt, the so-called ‘rivsalt’ is said to resemble a precious gemstone. 

Himalayan rock salt is said to be the purest form of the seasoning, and is being sold by Harvey Nichols with a stainless steel grater 

It comes with a Japanese stainless steel grater and an engraved natural oak holder with a transparent lid – and will set you back £25.

A spokesman for department store Harvey Nichols, which is stocking the product from next week, claimed it would give people a ‘unique and original dining experience’, adding: ‘The salt is turned into faceted rocks of various sizes and shades, from rosy pink to translucent white.’

Its creators hope it will become a common sight on tables across the country, and help transform the image of salt, which they feel has been dismissed as unhealthy and unfashionable.

But the sales patter failed to impress health campaigners. Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of Consensus Action on Salt and Health, said: ‘They are promoting something that is potentially dangerous for people’s health. 

‘With grated salt, you end up with much larger crystals. 

Oddly enough, they taste less salty than fine grains so you keep adding more to your food and more salt is absorbed into your body. If you are going to eat salt, very fine crystals are better.’
