Embattled mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner has rebuked a report in The New York Observer alleging that he dated a former staffer who is 18 years his junior.

'It was a story entirely without sources, entirely about gossip around the office,' Weiner said at an event in Soundview Park in the Bronx, the Huffington Post reported. 'It had nothing for me to really respond to except to say that I've never had any inappropriate relationship with a staffer. That's the same thing the staffer said.'

The staffer, Dolev Azaria, has also denied that she and the former congressman had a relationship.

Embattled: New York mayoral candidate did have a relationship with an aide, according to his office

Ms Azaria sent a letter to the Observer yesterday through her lawyer in which she 'vehemently 
denies' the couple had a relationship.

Ms Azaria added: 'Anthony was my boss and a mentor and we remain friends to this day. There
was never anything inappropriate about our relationship. I’m saddened 
that rumors to the contrary would imply anything else.'

The Observer quoted Barbara Morgan, a spokeswoman for Weiner, as saying that her boss had a 'personal relationship' with Azaria.

The Observer story states: 'Partially confirming the relationship, she said the two “had a personal relationship." At that point, Ms. Morgan stopped mid-sentence to request the conversation be continued off the record.'

The Observer also cites about a dozen anonymous sources who worked in Mr Weiner's office at the time, who described a relationship between the Weiner and Azaria as a badly-kept open secret that began long before Ms Azaria left Mr Weiner's payroll in 2006 and continuing when she returned in mid-2008.

One former ex-aide, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'You’d have to be an idiot to not know 
what was going on.'

Another said: 'It was a known secret in 
the office.'

A third source added they were '100 per cent' sure there was something going on between the two.

Revelation: The 'personal relationship' with an aide was said to have ended before Anthony Weiner married his wife Huma Abedin (pictured here with him)

The way Mr Weiner behaved around Ms Azaria was in stark contrast to the way he behaved around other staff, the sources added.

They claim the behavior continued in 2008, when Mr Weiner, now 48, began dating his current wife, Huma Abedin.

Azaria earned $125,202 with Weiner during the 2010 campaign cycle and she earned $86,652 in the 2012 cycle  according to OpenSecrets.org.

While relationships between staffers and their bosses are not unheard of, the revelation throws into doubt Mr Weiner's previous claim that his personal relationships were limited to his private life.

One of the sources reported the pair coming and going together at all hours while Mr Weiner was running his campaign office from his apartment.

The New York Daily News in 2004 described the pair at a late-night party together with comedian Jon Stewart and Leonardo DiCaprio following the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

'Hours after the final gavel ended the Democratic National Convention in Boston, Jon Stewart and Leonardo DiCaprio still huddled at the Roxy with New York Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn & Queens) and his finance aide, Dolev Azaria,' the article read.  'They stayed until the wee hours Friday.'

Phone conversations between the pair, overheard by other members of the team, were said to have gone beyond professional boundaries.

Scandal: Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 after admitting to sending lewd pictures to a college student

When one person started at the office they were warned not to say anything negative in front of Ms Azaria because it would get back to Mr Weiner.

Another described suspicious holes in Mr Weiner’s schedule when the two would turn up together.

A third pointed out Ms Asaria used a holiday photo of them together as her screensaver.

Ms Azaria first started working for Mr Weiner’s Congressional office on a part-time basis in 2001, according to Congressional records obtained through LegiStorm.

The following year she moved next door to Mr Weiner in his Sheepshead Bay building, campaign finance records show.

She was steadily promoted over the next three years, eventually working on Mr Weiner’s congressional and mayoral campaigns. Here salary in 2002 was $26,833.32 and the following year, she earned $29,000.

Her swift rise through the ranks earned Ms Azaria a mention in New York Magazine.

In 2005, an article listed her as someone who had potential to become famous. The article read: 'Two years ago, Congressman Anthony Weiner tapped Azaria to be his campaign-finance director; she oversaw a staff of six, some of whom were PhDs 15 years her senior.

'Now she’s launching her own political-consultancy firm.'

In a follow-up article in 2010, New York Magazine reported: 'Azaria is still helping raise money for Anthony Weiner, just like she 
was five years ago. But now she has a healthy collection of other 
Democrats in her stable — Sean Maloney, John Sabini, David Yassky, 
Anthony Weiner, and Mike McMahon. She says she’s angling to get more 
involved in the nonprofit sector in the near future. “I remain strongly 
dedicated to supporting people whose ideology I believe in and whose 
career I want to further, but I also remain committed to giving back to 
the larger community and to people in need throughout the world.”'

Ms Azaria left Weiner's payroll in October 2006 and returned in June 2008.

But questions arose over why she was paid for three months after Mr Weiner was embroiled in the sexting scandal that forced him to resign in June, 2011. He had admitted to sending lewd pictures to a college student.

As Ron Brynaert, the former executive editor at The Raw Story, wrote in a blog last year, Ms Azaria received an increase in pay from $6,318 to $8,500 for those three post-resignation months - a rise of nearly 35 percent.

The Weiner campaign attributed it to a bookkeeping anomaly caused by the fact Ms Azaria was the last person on his staff and was responsible for closing the office down.

Ms Morgan described Ms Dolev as one of Mr Weiner's most 'skillfull' employers and said their relationship was 'appropriate at all times'.
