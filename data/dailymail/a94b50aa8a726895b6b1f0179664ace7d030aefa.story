A woman has been charged with a string of offences including kidnap, cruelty to children and trafficking, after she made off with her friend's baby and embarked on a dramatic high-speed car chase.

Samantha Barrett, 22, of Georgia, allegedly kidnapped eight-month William Stover when his mother, Kristen Howard, went into a shop to buy a cigarette lighter on Tuesday evening.

She took off in Ms Howard's car at speeds of up to 100mph (160kmph) and even rammed the car of a state trooper as he pursued her.

Suspect: Samantha Barrett has been charged with a string of offences including kidnap, trafficking and child cruelty

Police issued an amber alert for a child abduction after they were contacted. The stolen vehicle was spotted on I-75 
in Henry County.

To stop her, police placed spike strips on the road, which shred the car's tyres, and it eventually crashed into an embankment in Lamar.

Ms Barrett then allegedly fled the scene of the crash on foot, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Eyewitness Nancy Turner, who lives near the site of the crash, said: 'I heard a big boom outside. She was running to my front door.

'I came outside and (the police) were tackling her to the ground.

William has now been reunited with his mother.

She said: 'We're enemies now - I hope they light her ass on fire.'

Police said another man was also in the car, but got out at some point during the chase and was unlikely to face charges.

According to Lamar County Sheriff deputy sergeant, Christopher Webster, police would not normally chase after a car with a child inside.

He said: 'But this is a situation where this child has been kidnapped.

'And the safety of this child â€¦ you know, what's going to happen to this child? What's the woman's intention?'

He said the baby wasn't crying and seemed 'oblivious' to the situation when police found him.

One
motorist found himself in the middle of the police pursuit after the 
stolen car, with the baby inside, swerved in front of his car, according
to news website wsbtv.com.

Shaun Spears said: 'At that point, I didn't know if the child was injured, what her plans were, her intentions.

'I had them (911 dispatcher) on the phone, I looked down at my speedometer. I was running 85 and she was pulling away from me.'

Critical: Police rush to the vehicle and open the door of the back seat looking for baby William

Protocol: Officers do not normally do high-speed chases when children are involved but they broke they rules, such was their concern for the eight-month-old baby

He added: 'I've got kids of my own. That's the first thing that goes through your head when something bad like that happens. What if the kid was yours?'

Ms Barrett was charged with grand theft auto, kidnapping, cruelty to children and trafficking.
