They may seem like hilarious YouTube clips, but they have received more than 30 million views worldwide and the Peterson brothers are on a crusade to tell the world the truth about farming.

Their next stop is Down Under, with the American brothers taking a break from the family farm to perform to Aussie audiences.

The brothers will perform at the Australian Cotton Conference at the Gold Coast, Queensland on August 7, before a performance for GippsDairy in West Victoria on August 9.

The Peterson brothers YouTube videos are adding a bit of spunk and humour to give agriculture an image makeover

The clever, informative lyrics show that the brothers have both brains and braun!

The notoriety the brothers have gained is enormous achievement for three American brothers, living and working on a fifth generation family farm in a small town called Assaria in central Kansas.

The Peterson Farm Bros have an impressive catalogue of hilarious farm-themed parody songs, which all began with their song ‘I’m Farming and I Grow It,’ to the tune of LMFAO’s ‘I’m Sexy and I Know It.’  

23-year-old Greg Peterson is the oldest of the trio and the mastermind behind most of The Peterson Farm Bros’ songs. He works on his family farms and performs with his younger brothers, Nathan, 20, and Kendall, 18. Their 14-year-old sister Lauren also makes cameo appearances.

‘I was at dinner with some friends and sang ‘I’m Farming and I Grow It’ and got a laugh. It was all joking around,’ says Mr Peterson.

‘We made the first YouTube video for our family and friends but it took off in a way we could have never even dreamed of, it’s unbelievable how big it’s become.’

The clip was watched one million times in the first four times.

Today it has been viewed 9 million times and they have added many other songs to their repertoire, including ‘Chore’ (Katy Perry’s ‘Roar’) and their hilarious Gangnam Style parody clip, ‘Farmer Style’ to huge success.   

At the heart of these videos is a serious message, which is communicated with the use of social media, music and comedy.

‘Humour is really important in reaching our audience – it’s the bridge to connect with the people not in farming wouldn’t be watching our video if they weren’t funny with funny music

‘We’re really passionate about debunking all the things people believe about agriculture that are not true. I want to correct the mistruths and get the truth out there, to be an advocate for what’s right and truthful’ 

The filmclips feature hilarious but also beautiful images of farm life

Greg Peterson writes of his concerns on a blog and as well as performing their songs, give presentations that explain the importance of agriculture.

‘There are people that think of today’s farmers as huge, industrial farmers, concerned not about ethics and animal welfare, but motivated rather by greed and money. This could not be further from the truth!’

Greg has a degree in Agricultural Communications & Journalism, with a minor in music performance. His brothers are both currently studying other degrees in the Kansas State University's agriculture program.

'I’ve always kind of been a musician who happens to farm but my brothers are farmers that happen to sing.

'I like how we’ve happened to blend music and farming and hopefully we can continue to do that for the rest of our lives, but the goal has always been for all three brothers to farm together on our farm. We really love carrying on that family tradition.'

Greg Peterson believes people don't appreciate the importance of farmers.

'Agriculture is becoming more and more important and people are definitely unaware just how crucial it is. There are also a lot of issues now. There are more and more people to feed but less land to try and produce food on.'

The Peterson brothers will be in Australia in August to spread their message about the importance of farming

The boys are not afraid to make fun of themselves to make others laugh, as they film hilarious clips around the farm

'We are dedicating our lives to farming because it is fun and carrying on the family tradition makes it the right choice. But it's also because we know we are feeding the world and working in such an important industry.

The Peterson Bros are looking forward to taking the conversation to Australia.

'I’m sure Australians will understand our message about people not respecting farmers any more and accusing farmers of doing things they're not, so I think Australians will appreciate the message of needing to advocate farming more because I’m sure they’re going through a lot of the same things we are.'
