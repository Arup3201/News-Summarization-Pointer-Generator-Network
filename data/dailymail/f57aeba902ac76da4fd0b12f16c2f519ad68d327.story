There was shock for a second day running at Wimbledon as Switzerland's Roger Federer crashed out of the tournament in the quarter finals.

The world number three was beaten in an unexpected defeat by French hope Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who battled the six-times Wimbledon champion in a five set marathon.

It means Andy Murray now has one less challenge to overcome as he aims to win his first Wimbledon title, having breezed past Feliciano Lopez in straight sets in imperious form.

Tsonga's reward for beating Federer is a semi against Novak Djokovic. Murray's victory means he will now face another Spaniard, Rafael Nadal, who made it through to the semi-final by seeing off the challenge of Mardy Fish.

Federer's
defeat came after the Swiss had established a strong two-set lead where
it seemed he had the game in his stylish white bag.

But
in an amazing comeback that stunned the crowd, Tsonga snatched victory 
from the jaws of defeat by beating Federer three sets to two, winning 
six games to four in the final set.

A delighted Tsonga performed a 
victory dance as Roger quietly walked from the court he has come to call
his own over the past eight years.

After his match Murray said he was surprised at Federer's exit but that Tsonga had simply played too well for even the Swiss legend to cope.

'I don't think Roger played a bad match,' said Murray.

Sometimes other guys just play too good.'

Confident Federer fans looked
jubilant as Federer easily took the first two sets.

But their smiles 
faded as he lost the third set and it became clear he could not push 
back against Tsonga's unwavering energy.
