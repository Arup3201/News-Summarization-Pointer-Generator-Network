Ambulance crews have been blasted for endangering public safety after paramedics stopped to pick up an injured badger and gave it a lift to the vets - where it was put down.

Rescue teams spotted the injured animal as they returned from taking a patient to hospital at 3am on October 28.

Their Good Samaritan act has been criticised by a whistleblower who claims they put public health at risk.

The badger (not pictured) was spotted at the side of the road by paramedics who rushed it to the vets in their Ambulance (not pictured) - prompting fears for public health

South Central Ambulance Service NHS 
Foundation Trust (SCAS) admitted crews transported the badger after 
spotting it on the road near Banbury, Oxon.

A worker wrote on Facebook: 'We found an injured badger in the road about 3am on night shift the other night.

'I rang my vet and we took it down to her in the ambulance. She put it down (it was too far gone for saving). :('

But the whistleblower, who has not been named, accused the service of endangering patients’ safety.

They said: 'My concern is that it sounds like a dying wild badger was transported to a vet via an emergency ambulance.

'This is obviously a risk to patients and to the public - the chance of infection e.g badger tuberculosis, the risk of a patient being allergic to badger hair, possible badger bodily fluids etc.

'Was the ambulance thoroughly cleaned afterwards? Are people happy knowing their tax money was spent on transporting an ill badger?'

SCAS confirmed staff had used an ambulance to transport an injured badger to a veterinary practice in Banbury on October 28, but denied there was any risk to public health.

Spokesman James Keating-Wilkes said: 'In the early hours of October 28 an ambulance crew returning from hospital to base encountered what they believed to be a dead badger in the road in Banbury and, believing that this posed a danger to other road users, stopped to move it to the side of the road.

'On approaching the animal the crew noticed that the badger was alive and in considerable distress.

'They contacted a local vet who asked them to bring the badger in to a veterinary practice approximately half a mile from the scene, which they did.

South Central Ambulance Service has a compassionate and caring workforce. The crew’s actions will be reviewed. At no point was patient safety compromised.'

Despite the efforts to save the badger, it was taken to West Bar Veterinary Surgery in Banbury, Oxon., where it was put down.
