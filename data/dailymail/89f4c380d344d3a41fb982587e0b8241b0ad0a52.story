These conjoined twin brothers are lucky to be alive after being born sharing the same torso because of a rare one-in-a-million medical condition.

Sohna and Mohna have defied all the odds to celebrate their ninth birthday despite their condition killing most at birth.

In an orphanage in Amritsar, India, the pair go to lessons and live life to the full even though they share the same torso and two legs - each boy has their own two arms.

A one-in-a-million chance: Sohna and Mohna suffer from dicephalic parapagus meaning they share the same torso and legs

The brothers are what is known as dicephalic parapagus twins and their amazing story will be aired for the first time in 'The Twins Who Share a Body - A Body Shock Special' on Channel 4 at 10pm tomorrow.

The Indian twins are just one of a handful of known cases alive today in the world as more than half of twins with the condition are stillborn.

They are growing up in an institution after being given up by their parents who were afraid they couldn't provide for them.

Trying to lead normal lives: The boys live in an orphanage in Amritsar, India, and attend school every day

The pair go to school each day and both can read and write.

As the remarkable documentary shows doctors are still unsure how the children cope so well with their condition.

Following their journey, the show reveals some remarkable findings about how the boys live in one body controlled by two brains.

Dr Rakesh Chouhan said: 'It's still a mystery and we're not 100 percent sure how these things are happening.

Defying the odds: The brothers will soon celebrate their ninth birthday despite the majority of twins with their condition being stillborn

'The most remarkable thing is two brains, single body being controlled separately and still they're a single unit.'

Dicephalic parapagus is an extremely rare form of conjoined twins.

Approximately half of conjoined twins are stillborn and the overall survival rate for conjoined twins is just 25 per cent.

Twins with Dicephalic parapagus have an even smaller chance of survival as they share the same torso and it is impossible to separate them.

Twins, such as Sohna and Mohna, share most parts of their body but think completely independently of each other.

The birth of such twins is more common in south-west Asia and Africa.

However, there have been instances of dicephalic parapagus twins in the West.

In the U.S. Abigail and Brittany Hensel have become media celebrities, appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and featuring in television documentaries.

The
examination even reveals Sohna and Mohna get sleepy at different times 
and sense touch completely separately on their body divided exactly down
the middle.

Nanny Parmjit Kaur said the boys had a fully individual sense of themselves.

She
said: 'Sohna and Mohna think as two separate people. With shoes or 
socks, Sohna will put on his own and Mohna will put on his own. They 
will never put them on for each other.

'When they've been playing we tell them to wash their hands and legs.

'Sohna will wash his leg and walk away so we have to take Mohna back so he can wash his leg. That's how it is.'

The documentary also follows conjoined baby twins Jesus and Emmanuel living in Brazil.

Born deep in the rainforest, the six-month-old boys present medics with a battle to save them as the twins have just one heart between them.

Like so many twins sharing so much the show discovers it causes medical complications as Jesus develops a collapsed lung.

There is then the agonising moment the parents may have to decide if they should save one if the other dies.

Medical miracle: Despite sharing the same body, the boys think independently, get tired at different times and feel sensation on different sides of their body
