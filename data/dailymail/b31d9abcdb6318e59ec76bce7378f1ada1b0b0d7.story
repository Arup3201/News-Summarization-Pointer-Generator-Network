An American newsreader finished off a broadcast with perhaps the most feelgood news story of her life - her own wedding proposal.

After her fiancé had hijacked the studio's autocue, Fox54's news anchor Jillian Pavlica began to unwittingly read out a 'breaking news story'.

Speaking into the camera on live television, she started to read the script, saying: 'We have some breaking news to report to 
you, FOX54 has just learned that a Huntsville news anchor is being 
proposed to on live TV right now'.

Stunned: The news anchor was left stunned after realising that she had read out the first part of the proposal on live television

Before finishing the script, the stunned newsreader began to stumble as she realised what was happening.

As her co-presenters left her side, Miss Pavlica's fiancé Vince walked into the studio.

Video of the live broadcast shows him telling his partner: 'Finally all our pieces are falling together. I can't picture a day in my life not waking up with you.'

He then drops on to one knee, before saying: 'Jillian Pavlica, will you marry me?'

A clearly emotional Miss Pavlica replies 'Yes' before the two kiss.

Before the segment, the Nine O'Clock News producer Dana Conley told Miss Pavlica that there was breaking news.

Miss Conley told the newsreader that she had written the script and entered it into the autocue, telling her to just read it.

One of the show's co-presenters was left to finish the 9pm broadcast on Saturday evening, reading the weather forecast.

He said: 'Here in the FOX54, 100 percent chance of a few tears of joy tonight.'
