A rabbi on a seaside holiday accidentally drowned while performing his daily ritual bathing in the sea.

Jewish Orthodox Dov Berish Englander, 47, got into difficulties while performing a mikveh - a full body immersion in water to gain ritual purity.

The rabbi was on holiday from London and staying at the scenic seaside town of Aberystwyth in West Wales when tragedy struck.

Rabbi Englander walked in to the sea for an early morning ritual bath on Thursday, but soon got into difficulties.

A guest at a hotel overlooking the bay rang 999 after seeing him struggling to stay afloat.

A lifeboat and rescue helicopter were sent to the scene and lifeboat crew pulled the rabbi from the water.

Paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he was declared dead at Bronglais General Hospital, Aberystwyth.

Rabbi Berish Englander, from Stamford Hill, north London, was described as 'highly respected' for his religious knowledge and charitable work.

He was staying at the seaside resort of Aberystwyth - a popular destination for strictly Orthodox families.

A member of the Jewish Orthodox community, who was on holiday in Aberystwyth and knew Rabbi Englander, paid tribute to him.

He said: 'He was an extremely righteous and very, very prominent and respected rabbi in our community.

'He was a good example to all. He was the kind of man you would take your children to meet, to use him as an example to the children.

'He was very kind and generous and gave an enormous amount of money to charity. He will be missed by everyone who knew him.'

Police said they are not treating the incident as suspicious.

In June, Satmar Chasid Rabbi Chaim Breisch died after struggling in a rough sea off Broadstairs, Kent.
