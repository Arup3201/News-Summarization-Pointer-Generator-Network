Bravely speaking out: Lydia Cuomo, 26, has revealed her identity to campaign for a change in New York rape law

A schoolteacher who was sexually assaulted in broad daylight by a gun-wielding NYPD officer has broken her silence after a hung jury failed to convict him of rape.

Lydia Cuomo, 26, was attacked by Michael Pena  in August 2011 as she walked to school in the Bronx, New York.

Pena pleaded guilty and was convicted in March last year of the predatory sexual assault of the young woman - but not of her rape.

New York state defines rape as only vaginal penetration and not forced oral and anal sex.

Miss Cuomo then had to watch three months later in June 2012 as Pena again admitted to raping her in order to take a plea deal and avoid a retrial.

He was given another ten years for the deal on top of his 75-years to life sentence for sexual assault.

The schoolteacher has now bravely chosen to reveal her identity in order to highlight how rape legislation is failing victims of brutal assaults.

Miss Cuomo told the New York Daily News this week: 'I feel like essentially I had a silver platter of a rape 
case. I had witnesses, I had DNA, I had my own testimony, I had two 
cops.

'I had them saying, ''We admit he 
sexually assaulted you,'' and I didn’t get the verdict I needed the 
first time, and that just highlights to me the problem in the system.'

She added that she was stunned to find that the legal system would not look upon what had happened to her as a rape.

Miss Cuomo had been on her way to work for the first day of her 'dream job' teaching second-graders at a Bronx charter school when she was abducted and assaulted at gunpoint in an 
alley by Pena, a cop of three years, who screamed to her that he was going to 'blow your 
f****** face off'.

Despite the jury convicting Pena of 
oral and anal sodomy, two jurors would not find him guilty of two counts
of rape or two counts of predatory sexual assault.

This came after a doctor gave evidence in court
that the victim was raped and semen was found on her 
underwear.

The jurors' 
reasoning was if Miss Cuomo couldn't recall the color of a car directly 
opposite the alley where she was attacked, then how could she be sure 
she was penetrated.

Miss Cuomo has this week joined forces 
with Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas (D-Queens) who last year introduced a
bill that would make forced oral and anal sex part of New York's rape 
statutes.

'Lydia and others who have endured such 
trauma deserve justice... to 
ensure that rape is always called by its name.'

The move would bring New York rape legislation in line with states like Tennessee and South Dakota.

Miss Cuomo will hold a news conference on Tuesday in Albany surrounded by her family and share her story with legislators as the bill is reintroduced.

Assembly member Simotas said in a statement to MailOnline today: 'I applaud Lydia Cuomo for speaking out and lending her support for the Rape is Rape bill. Her courage in coming forward to shed light on this important issue is truly inspiring.

'Lydia’s story illustrates the heart of what we are trying to accomplish by passing this legislation - it is truly about the victims; more than anything, the law must be responsive to them.

'Lydia and others who have endured such trauma deserve justice, and it is the goal of this common-sense bill to ensure that rape is always called by its name.'

At the time of Pena's sentencing last year, Miss Cuomo told the court: 'My life has been shattered - my sense of security, my sense of safety, any and all independence.

'He used his weapon and basically destructed my life.'

However Miss Cuomo, who is originally from New Hampshire, has refused to let the attack take away what she has worked so hard for.

She has returned to her dream job of teaching elementary schoolchildren in the Bronx.
