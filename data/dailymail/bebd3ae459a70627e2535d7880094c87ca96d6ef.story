It seems this week's tempestuous Winter Storm Juno has proved itself to be quite the aphrodisiac.

Location-based mobile dating app Hinge - similar in nature to Tinder - has reported a significant surge in traffic during the hours immediately leading up to East Coast blizzard chaos, according to The Huffington Post.

Hinge's marketing director Karen Fein said that Monday started out like any typical day, but that the app saw a 27per cent spike in the number of logins between the hours of 3pm and 10pm - just as many East Coasters were sent home from work early to hunker down and wait for the blizzard to hit.

Hinge links users on the basis of two factors; proximity, like Tinder, and social 'friends of friends' connections, using data from Facebook.

According to the company, 99per cent of its users are college-educated, most commonly working in industries such as banking, media and fashion.  

On average, Hinge users logged into the app a record number of 4.75 times on Monday.

The company declined to release more detailed user statistics. 

'Most of our users are young professionals and knew work would be closed,' said Ms Fein. 'Who wouldn't want a playdate on a snow day?'

According to ABC News, this phenomenon was echoed across the board, with dating site Match.com reporting a 60 per cent traffic spike in 'blizzard states', and OKCupid seeing a ten per cent lift in activity.

Heating up: A slew of Craigslist ads seeking 'snuggle buddies' have apparently emerged, mainly in New York and Connecticut, with people posting requests for strangers to join them for lock down

Uplift: Shopping platform Lyst  reported a pre-blizzard spike in New York-based web traffic for its luxury lingerie section, with page views for Agent Provocateur up by more than 500per cent

In addition, a slew of Craigslist ads seeking 'snuggle buddies' apparently emerged in advance of the storm, mainly in New York and Connecticut, with people posting requests for strangers to join them for lock down.

One Craigslist poster was looking for a storm-partner to share 'endless movies, red wine, potential igloo-making... and making out.'

Another was seeking a 'cute woman' to 'have fun and keep warm with'.

Even sexy lingerie sales were up across regions in which a decent storm-battering was expected.

Shopping platform Lyst reported a sudden, unexpected spike in New York-based web traffic for its very pricey underwear section just ahead of the blizzard.

Page views for Agent Provocateur - with prices averaging $700 a bra - increased by more than 500per cent between the weekend and Tuesday morning.

Myla, La Perla and Kiki de Montparnasse also saw an uplift in traffic.

For those New Yorkers who did splash out on expensive lingerie, however, or line up dates in the hopes of eschewing the office on Monday, there was disappointment all round.

Juno failed to live up to its 'worst storm in history' expectations, instead only dumping New York with about ten inches at the most.

Parts of New England, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and Massachusetts, however, did get hammered by the snow - with Boston worst hit yesterday.

So for those who did get lucky on dating sites in the wake of Juno, this could be the start of some very stormy relationships.
