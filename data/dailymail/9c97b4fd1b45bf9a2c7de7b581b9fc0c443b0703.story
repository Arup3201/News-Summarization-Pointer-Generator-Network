More than half of couples don’t manage to consummate their marriage on their wedding night, a new study has found - with alcohol, stress and exhaustion named as the top passion killers.

Here, four writers confess what happened that night for them, revealing that for some, it seems, passion always finds a way...

Too tired and tipsy: More than half of couples don't consummate their marriage on their wedding night

Jenni Murray, 63, lives in Cheshire with her second husband David. They have two sons. She says:

Too much to drink: Jenni's marriage didn't get off to a passionate start

It was 1971 and I was all of 21. I'd met Brian Murray (yes, it's his name I began working with and it stuck, even after the divorce) at university.

He was handsome and funny - a dead ringer for my movie star of choice, Robert Redford, and we were very much in love.

You'd think that nothing could stand in the way of an appropriately amorous wedding night.

He never actually proposed, so I guess getting married was simply mutually agreed. It was social suicide openly to 'live in sin' in those days. Our mothers would probably have murdered us. So, off I went to church in the full white monty.

My mother had gone into overdrive making plans for the wedding of her only child and the whole day was exhausting. It was a huge relief to arrive at a small country hotel in North Yorkshire for the only honeymoon we could afford - a long weekend before heading off for our final year at university.

Not one to miss an opportunity for residents' past time drinking hours and the chance for a convivial social occasion, Brian led me, not to the marriage bed, but to the bar. Eventually, after much imbibing, we hit the sack.

'Well,' said he, 'I suppose we’d better consummate this marriage.' I explained the room seemed to be spinning. I felt a bit sick (I wasn't used to drinking.)

The feeling overwhelmed me. The bathroom was down the corridor. I ran as fast as I could, but I missed. I staggered back to the room, pale and shamefaced. 'I'm sorry,' I sobbed and passed out. He spent what was left of our wedding night clearing up the bathroom.

No wonder it didn't last - we were divorced seven years later.

Anne Atkins lives in Bedford with her husband Shaun. They have five children. She says:

Virginal bride: Anne couldn't wait to have sex

Did we make love on our wedding night? You bet we did!

I'd been counting off the minutes for over a year. We were Christians so we were both virgins, and had been waiting for the night with the keenest expectation.

My husband Shaun is a clergyman in the Church of England, and some years ago a counsellor asked us why we got married. Apparently he was expecting some pious answer such as, 'To help each other in Christian work'. We both immediately and unanimously replied, 'Sex'. Why else would you get married?

Wild horses couldn't have kept us apart on our wedding night, on St Swithun’s Day, July 15, 1983, just after we finished our Finals. Funnily enough however, my mother unwittingly scuppered any sneaking off in the afternoon.

She shared our Christian values, and also had a great sense of fun and love of life, and said she fully expected Shaun to 'take me off somewhere' in the two-hour gap between the main afternoon reception, in King's College, Cambridge, and the dinner and dancing in the evening. I was so embarrassed at her even having these thoughts that I made very sure we didn't.

Instead, we went and had tea with friends of my parents. I made sure my hair remained up and tidy, leaving my mother in no doubt whatsoever that it hadn't been rumpled and tussled. 

At midnight, however, we retired, sober and excited to our hotel room and enjoyed a night of madly-looked forward to - and extremely inexpert - lovemaking. It was worth the wait.

Esther Rantzen, 73, has three children from her marriage to Desmond Wilcox, who died in 2000. She says:

Heavily pregnant: Esther wasn't in the mood on her wedding night

The morning of my wedding day, December 2, 1977, dawned clear, bright and frosty. I woke with my heart pounding, struck with such intense bridal nerves that I turned to my husband-to-be, and said 'Desmond, we're rushing this.'

He didn't agree. We'd lived together for ten years, I was 37 years old and our first baby was due in a month, yet still the prospect of getting married petrified me.

I shook with terror throughout the marriage ceremony at Kingston Register Office. And when we drove that evening to the cosy riverside hotel we had booked for our wedding night, I was only just beginning to recover and was hardly 'in the mood'.

Dinner that night didn't help. The hotel chef, realising what a hugely important night it was, decided to cook a traditional Austrian wedding breakfast for us. It was eight courses of incredibly phallic food.

There were sausages with everything and a strange pyramid-shaped mountain of ice-cream to finish. By the time we reached the bridal suite I was not feeling at all well.

I collapsed on the four-poster bed, and Desmond swiftly followed. Having consumed my share of the champagne it wasn't long before he began to breathe very deeply. I knew the signs. Any minute now he would pass out completely.

As I leaned over him tenderly, his eyes opened and he smiled and said 'Come here, Barrel Belly'. It may not have been kind, but it was accurate - I must have been the biggest bride the honeymoon suite had ever seen.

I suppose it's no wonder that I laughed, hit my new husband and fell asleep next to him. The next morning I rang my sister and suggested she bring her whole family to our honeymoon hotel to finish the mountain of food.

It's a measure of my husband's tolerance that he forgave me and it's a tribute to our relationship that we survived our passion-free wedding night.

Brian Viner, 51, is married to Jane, also 51. They have three children: Eleanor, 20, Joe 18 and Jake 15. They live in Herefordshire. He says:

Ashamed: Brian partied while his new wife went to bed

Jane and I had been living together for two years before we got married, on a crisp January day in Derbyshire, in 1993. But did we consummate our new married status on our wedding night at a country house hotel near Bakewell? We did not. In fact, to my enduring shame, we didn't even retire to bed at the same time.

Jane was three months pregnant, her growing bump accommodated by an empire line wedding-dress, and half-way through the barn dance she made her excuses.

But I felt an urgent need for more do-si-do-ing, so I carried on whooping it up until my new sister-in-law, Jackie, politely but firmly told me that my place was upstairs with my bride, not downstairs twirling other women around the dance floor.

That's not why we didn't do it, though.

There was just far too much to talk about, from what friends and relatives had worn, to how one or two of them behaved, to an assessment of the food, the drink, the speeches, and the look on a few faces when I referred in my own speech to our forthcoming baby.

Almost everyone knew, but not a couple of aged aunts, one of whom went alarmingly, translucently pale and blamed her slack jaw on ill-fitting dentures.

The next morning, the slightly oleaginous hotel manager sidled up to me as we were loading our presents into the car, and in a broad Derbyshire accent said: 'A very good choice, young man, if I may say so.'

Much to our amusement, he conspicuously failed to take her to one side and give me the same stamp of approval. It became our first family saying, and we have cited it, on and off, ever since.
