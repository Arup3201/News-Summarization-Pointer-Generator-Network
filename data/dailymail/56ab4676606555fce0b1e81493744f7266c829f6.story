These are the four women who have inadvertently found themselves at the centre of a public furore after Mitt Romney boasted he was given 'whole binders full of women' capable of joining his cabinet.

Kerry Healey, Jane Edmonds, Jennifer Davis Carey and Ellen Roy Herzfelder were appointed to four of the 11 cabinet positions when Romney became Massachusetts governor, indicating they were handpicked from the now notorious binder he referenced during the presidential debate.

But, as Romney's claim about his bizarre hiring technique is ridiculed in a slew of internet memes, the women's group he claimed he recruited to find qualified female candidates has disputed his account.

The online buzz has thrust issues of 
women's equality and employment - and the candidates commitment to them - to the forefront of the agenda as election day looms.

In response to a question about hiring equality in Tuesday night's debate, Romney said he was so concerned about the number of women in the cabinet that he sought help from women's groups.

In the spotlight: Kerry Healey, left, and Jane Edmonds, right, both served in Mitt Romney's cabinet, which he said he devised with the help of women's groups who presented him with 'binders full of women'

Romney said: 'We took a concerted
effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be 
qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of 
women’s groups and said, "Can you help us find folks," and they brought 
us whole binders full of women.'

The odd claim sparked outcry and ridicule across social media - with mocking Tumblr and Twitter accounts cropping up within minutes - and among Democrats.

It has also cast a spotlight on the women who featured among the pages of the binders and were eventually successful in securing one of Romney's top jobs.

Three of the four women are Harvard educated and remain in public service positions - yet have continued to face tough competition, and defeat, from men.

Vetted: Ellen Roy Herzfelder, left, resigned from her post as environmental affairs secretary after her appointment to spend more time with her family. Jennifer Davis Carey, right, was also on the cabinet

Kerry Healey became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid.

But
at the end of the term, she ran for governor and faced in-party 
competition for the spot. The Republican pair were both eventually beaten by the male 
Democratic candidate, Deval Patrick.

Her later appointments to executive committees came at the hands of women, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton, and she continues to work for Romney in his presidential campaign.

Fellow Harvard graduate, Ellen Roy Herzfelder, was appointed as secretary of the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, but left in 2005 - to be replaced by a man - to spend time with her children.

Herzfelder, who had come under fire for an outstanding tax bill of $1 million for a company she set up with her family before her resignation, went on to become a senior policy adviser.

Claims: Romney, pictured with President Obama at the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, said he chose the women from a 'binder' presented by a women's group

Defiant: But women's groups claim they approached Romney (pictured with running mate Ron Paul) about vetting women to get more into top positions. And after he took office, their numbers fell

Jane Edmonds was appointed as Secretary of Workforce Development under Romney and admitted that, as a  liberal Democrat and African-American, many of her friends asked why she worked for him.

But
Edmonds, now a professor at Northeastern University, rallied for him at
the Republican National Convention, saying: 'He would make an excellent
president.'

Jennifer Davis Carey served as the secretary of Elder Affairs for Romney after working in the state's previous cabinet.

Following his term, she became the 
senior director of training and education for the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School - a position she still holds.

The nonpartisan Massachusetts women's coalition MassGAP - Massachusetts Government Appointments Project - has argued against the series of events leading to these women's hiring.

Before the election in 2002, they appealed to Romney and his 
Democratic opponent, Shannon O'Brien, to make a 'best effort' to 
appoint women in proportion to the makeup of the state's population. Both campaigns agreed and the group started vetting potential candidates for the roles.

'It was an initiative of women’s organizations, not to force [Romney’s] hand, but to make it be something he had to follow through on,' Carol Hardy-Fanta said in an interview.

'He didn't go out looking for these binders.'

Marissa Szabo, associate director of the Massachusetts Women’s Political Caucus, which founded MassGAP, said: 'Following the election, MassGAP formed committees for each cabinet post in the administration and began the process of recruiting, interviewing, and vetting women applicants.

At odds: Vice President Joe Biden, right, said it was troubling Romney had been unable to find qualified women, while Ron Paul, left, argued he had just wanted to show he had been thorough

After Romney became governor in 2003, Kerry Healey became his lieutenant governor - making her the most powerful woman in the state - and was lauded for her successfully implemented deficit cuts and improvements to aid. Like Romney, she chose not to take a salary for the position.

At the end of the term, she ran for governor and faced in-party 
competition for the spot. They were both eventually beaten by the male 
Democratic candidate, Deval Patrick.

Her later appointments to executive 
committees came at the hands of women, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary 
Clinton, and she continues to work for Romney in his presidential 
campaign.

Fellow 
Harvard graduate, Ellen Roy Herzfelder, was appointed as secretary of 
the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, but left in 2005 - to be 
replaced by a man - to spend time with her children.

Herzfelder,
who had come under fire for an outstanding tax bill of $1 million for a
company she set up with her family before her resignation, went on to 
become a senior policy adviser.

Jane Edmonds was appointed as Secretary of Workforce Development under Romney and admitted that, as a  liberal Democrat and African-American, many of her friends asked why she worked for him.

Jennifer Davis Carey served as the secretary of Elder Affairs for Romney after working in the state's previous cabinet.

Following
his term, she became the senior director of training and education for 
the University of Massachusetts Medical School - a position she still 
holds.

'Those committees selected top 
applicants for each position and presented this information to the 
administration for follow-up interviews and consideration for 
appointment.'

Liz Levin, former chairwoman of 
MassGAP, added that Romney had little contact with MassGAP and his 
nominee for lieutenant governor, Kerry Healey, worked with the 
organization for the project.

Romney never once met with the group and members assumed he was busy, she added.

Before Romney became governor in 2002, women comprised around 30 per cent of the all appointed senior-level posts in the state.

By 2004, 42 per cent of new appointments by the administration were female, but the years after, it dropped to 25 per cent, Szabo revealed in a statement.

In Romney's cabinet, four of the 11 posts were filled by women until one, Herzfelder, left - and was replaced by a man.

And O'Brien argued that, even though there was initially some improvement, men still filled the more important jobs.

'There is certainly glaring evidence that he hasn't put women in places of extreme power,' Melissa A. Walsh, president of the Massachusetts chapter of the National Organization for Women, said in 2003. 'He has chosen to surround himself with male chiefs.'

Jesse Mermell, who was also involved in the effort to recruit female candidates, said she was stunned that Romney, who had 25 years of experience in business, needed help finding women.

She added: 'All I know is that when he was elected governor, he made a promise to make his best efforts that women would be proportionate to the percentage of women in Massachusetts.

'By the time he left office, it was 25 percent. To me, that doesn't speak to a great commitment to women in the workplace.'

His statement at the debate also gathered criticism from Vice President Joe Biden, who said he was baffled as to why Romney would need help finding women to employ.

'I've never had any problem when there's a job opening having as many women apply as men,' Biden told This Morning on Wednesday.

Ridicule: The comments by Romney sparked a social networking frenzy and viewers created memes on Tumblr

Dig: Viewers laughed at the bizarre statement on Twitter, and Democrats also jumped on the phrase

'There's so many qualified women walking around in Boston, Massachusetts, so many qualified women walking around every place in this country, the idea you got to go ask help to find one, I didn't quite understand what he was talking about.'

Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, attempted to pick up the pieces and explain the comment.

'All he simply meant was that he went out of his way to try to recruit qualified women to serve in his administration when he was governor,' he said.

'That's really what he was saying. And by the way, he has an exceptional record of hiring women in very prominent positions in his administration and that's the point he was making.'
