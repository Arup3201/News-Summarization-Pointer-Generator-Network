They don’t need feeding, cleaning or taking for a walk - they are the robotic pets for a generation of children raised on tech and tablets.

A new era of sophisticated robotic pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry.

The techno-pets offer the advantage that they will not make a mess on the carpet or demand they are taken for a walk, making them a more practical option than a puppy or kitten for busy families.

A new era of sophisticated virtual pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry.

Roland Earl, director general of the British Toy and Hobby Association said: ‘There a lot of virtual pets, even the intelligent robots we are seeing might be seen as a pet substitute.

‘They are something to interact with that does not need feeding or cleaning up after.

‘I suppose families like clean and tidy houses, they spend a lot of time and money on their houses and they don’t like the mess and all the rest associated with a real pet.’

Mr Earl said: ‘There have always been “watch me” toys. People enjoy that. It is just fun. 

Character Options is also launching tiny versions of its Teksta robotic puppy, which is designed to behave like eight week old dogs. A less advanced, but popular version of the robo puppy is shown

A plethora of toys designed for children who can't have a real pet, are on the horizon.

A toy called Little Live Pets Clever Keet will be launched later this year and will cost £60.

Keet is billed as the ‘world’s smartest bird’. He talks, sings, dances, flaps his wings and even drives a cart.

The company, Character Options, will also debut toy budgies, owls, mice, and turtles, which can chat to their owner as well as 'wild pets' such as giant spiders with a scarily lifelike appearance.

It will also launch tiny versions of its Teksta robotic puppy, which is designed to behave like eight week old dogs. 

It is said to move realistically and respond to sound and touch.

And Hasbro will release JJ My Jumping Pug, a £40 furry pet that mimics a real dog.

They are among six toys and games identified by the British Toy and Hobby Association as being the big sellers of this year.

Lego and 'retro' toys such as the Thunderbirds Tracy Island are also set to be popular.

‘Some of the toys are incredibly clever. One of the most popular toys of last year was a parrot that you could talk to and it would then repeat back the words. That was endless fun. Kids really enjoyed that.’

A new more sophisticated version of the parrot, which is being called Little Live Pets Clever Keet and costs £60 ($91), is being launched later this year by toy firm Character Options.

Keet is billed as the ‘world’s smartest bird’. He talks, sings, dances, flaps his wings and even drives a cart.

The company’s menagerie also includes toy budgies, owls, mice, and turtles which can chat to their owner.

The firm has also launched a new range of ‘wild pets’, which include giant spiders with a scarily lifelike appearance that will scurry across floor and react to touch. 

The arachnids operate in three modes, cage, adventure and attack.

Character Options is also launching tiny versions of its Teksta robotic puppy, which are designed to behave like eight week old dogs.

The firm said: ‘They make the sweetest, most adorable life-like pet that children can own. Each pet features realistic movement, responsive reaction to sounds and touch.

‘Children can even programme these devoted companions to sit, walk, beg and even sing happy birthday.’

Rival manufacturer Hasbro has come up with something that is a little furrier and mimics a real dog, the JJ My Jumping Pug, which comes in at £40 ($61).  

The world’s biggest toy brand, Lego, is predicted to have another successful year, not least because of a tie-up with the toy and film phenomenon of 2014, Disney’s Frozen. Interactive Frozen dolls are shown

The jumping pug is among 36 toys and games identified by the association as likely to big sellers through 2015. 

They include a range of talking soft toys based on the new CBeebies series Twirlywoos, which comes from the creators of the Teletubbies.

The Twirlywoos are four small, bird-like characters who are inquisitive, enthusiastic and always looking to learn something new about the world.

The world’s biggest toy brand, Lego, is predicted to have another successful year, not least because of a tie-up with the toy and film phenomenon of 2014, Disney’s Frozen.

New for this year is a Disney Frozen: Elsa’s Sparkling Ice Castle at £35 ($53). There will also be a Minecraft Dungeon kit, as well as new sets under the Bionicle brand.

The makers of the Nerf brand of dart guns have come up with a sophisticated Rebelle Arrow Revolution Bow at £40 ($61), which appears to tap into the popularity of the Hunger Games and lead character Katniss Everdeen’s prowess with the weapon. 

This year is also predicted to be big for retro toys with new versions of the Thunderbirds Tracy Island expected to sell well alongside the launch of a new TV series on ITV. The must-have toy of 1992 is shown

Another film franchise that is expected to boost toy sales this year is James Bond with a new movie starring Daniel Craig called Spectre due out in November.

This year is the 50th anniversary of toy firm Corgi’s creation of the spy’s classic Aston Martin DB5. 

To celebrate it has created a limited edition of 2,000 gold-coloured cars and 10,000 silver-coloured cars that will be sold £20 ($30).

This year is also predicted to be big for retro toys with new versions of the Thunderbirds Tracy Island expected to sell well alongside the launch of a new TV series on ITV.
