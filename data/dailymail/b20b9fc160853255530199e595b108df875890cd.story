Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev faces a two-week wait to find out whether the SFA will charge him after being accused of racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan.

Sportsmail understands that Sky Sports cameras did not pick up the alleged incident during Saturday’s 2-1 Premiership win for the Scottish champions at Parkhead.

The pair were direct opponents for much of the match and Englishman Logan told referee Bobby Madden, his captain Mark Reynolds and manager Derek McInnes that the Bulgarian international called him a ‘black c***’.

The SFA are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on Monday

Tonev, who was making a belated debut for Celtic after arriving on a one-year-loan deal from Aston Villa in the summer, vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by his manager Ronny Deila.

On Monday, the SFA confirmed it had received a formal complaint from Aberdeen, as well as taking receipt of match reports from referee Madden and SPFL delegate John Connolly.

The governing body has now started the process of investigating the issue. That should include speaking to both Tonev and 26-year-old Logan, as well as Celtic boss Deila and Aberdeen’s McInnes.

With Tonev denying the allegation, a lack of conclusive evidence from Sky means it is a case of one man’s word against another. 

It is alleged that Tonev called the Aberdeen defender a 'black c***' during the game at Celtic Park

On Monday night, Tonev’s agent Anthony Ravaud said: ‘I want to emphasise that Aleksandar is not racist.

‘As soon as I found out about the charge, I spoke with Alex and he categorically denied to me making the comments that have been alleged.

‘I want to add that his English is not so good, so I do not see how he could communicate normally and insult Shay Logan.

‘Aleksandar and I are available to the disciplinary committee of the SFA at any time if they wish to receive more information. Our only request is to resolve the case as quickly as possible to clear Tonev’s name.’

Police Scotland are ‘making enquiries into the circumstances’ after learning about the incident via media reports.

Aberdeen privately accept that they Aleksandar Tonev is unlikely to be found guilty without more evidence

Celtic said on Sunday night that Aleksandar Tonev 'has stated that the accusation made is not true'

Aleksandar Tonev is still expected to travel to Salzburg for Celtic's Europa League tie on Thursday
