A father whose weight ballooned to 22st, prompting teenagers to shout ‘fat git’ at him in the street, has managed to lose nearly 9st in a year thanks to a smartphone app.

Chris Angel, 46, had become so overweight one night he was convinced he was having a heart attack, as his diet of fried foods, takeaways, dessert and beer had left him in poor health.

He suffered crippling back pain from the strain of carrying his large stomach around, and couldn’t walk for longer than 15 minutes without getting out of breath.

After doctors warned he was on the brink of type 2 diabetes, had high blood pressure, and faced a lifetime of medication, he decided to lose weight.

The wake up call to lose weight came when Mr Angel woke up in the night terrified he was having a heart attack. After carrying out tests, his doctor warned he was on the brink of type 2 diabetes 

Mr Angel stumbled on a smartphone app which allowed him to keep a food diary and tot up his daily calories. After swapping takeaways and dessert for chicken and broccoli, he slimmed down to 13st (pictured)

He stumbled across a smartphone app which allowed him to keep a food diary and count the calories he was consuming daily, so he could cut down and lose weight.

He swapped takeaways and beer for chicken and vegetables, and started going to the gym and doing long walks.

Within a year he had lost nearly 9st (57 kg), and weighed a slim 13st (83kg).

Mr Angel, who lives in Woking, says the call to action to lose weight came one night when he woke up at 3am with terrible chest pain.

He said: 'I was utterly convinced I was having a heart attack. Instead of calling an ambulance, I got up, walked around and went back to bed until it stopped.

'The next day I went to the doctors and they told me I had heart palpitations, which weren't life threatening.

'They were deeply unsettling and uncomfortable to experience.

'I thought “if that's what heart palpitations feel like, what would a heart attack feel like?”

After a series of tests, the doctor told him he had high blood pressure, and was pre-diabetic.

'My GP gave me a brutal choice: take medication to control my blood pressure and the possible onset of type 2 diabetes – or lose a lot of weight.

'I didn't want to face a life on medication, and ultimately my life expectancy could be affected if I carried on the way I was.

'I had a word with myself and said 'Look sunshine, you're going to be 45 and it's not going to get easier to lose weight.

‘You've got a choice between eating yourself into a coma or doing something about it.'

Mr Woking says he was born overweight and then gained weight after moving to America, where he said eating large portions and doing little exercise was the norm.

He said: 'I was born in 1968 quite heavy. I was consistently on the heavier end of the scale all my life.

'In 1988 I moved to the U.S. and everything they say about the American diet is true.

'You can put on a stone in a holiday. If you go there for 15 years and you don't pay any attention to what you're eating, you can put on a lot more.'

He said the culture in Florida, where he was living, was to eat out.

'I was getting takeaways three times a week, lots of restaurant eating.

'I was eating fried foods, pizza, ice creams. All the things I like but probably shouldn't eat.

'And in America, you don't go walking, you drive everywhere.'

Over the next two decades, he piled on the pounds. Noticing this, he tried a range of diets to lose weight.

'I would go on a diet every few months, but wouldn't stick to it. Weight watchers, Atkins, juice diets, fasting diets.

When he was overweight, Mr Angel said he suffered aching joints, headaches from the high blood pressure, and he couldn't walk further than 15 minutes. He had to buy his clothes from special 'big and tall' shops

'Every six or eight months there was a new fad diet and I'd try it.

'But because my weight was not stopping me having a career or raising my child, it just never seemed like a priority.

'I can honestly say I was never embarrassed about my weight – which is probably a bad thing as it meant I was fat for so long.'

By New Year's Day 2013 he weighed 22st, his heaviest weight ever.

By this point he was suffering serious physical discomfort as a result of his body fat.

'There is aching knees, they used to grind. My ankles that would twist and I wouldn't be able to walk.

'Then, a constant aching back, and headaches from the high blood pressure.'

He said he didn't realise at the time, but looking back he believes he was depressed because of his weight.

'Kids in the street would say 'look at that fat git' and what could I say? They weren't wrong.'

'I had to do my clothes shopping in what I call 'big and tall shops' where I couldn't get fashionable clothes. It didn't feel great.'

When he started suffering heart palpitations so bad he thought he was going to die, and doctors warned he faced a lifetime of health problems, he knew it was time to act.

He began to research ways of losing weight and stumbled across the Nutracheck website and phone app.

Now he has lost weight (left), Mr Angel enjoys going on 7 mile walks at the weekend. He can buy clothes from 'normal' shops like Debehams (his old trousers are pictured, right)

He kept a food diary on the app, and it calculated all the calories in the food he was eating, so he could keep a check of his total consumption.

He set himself a goal of getting down to 16 stone (104.5 kg) by December 2014, but by June had already smashed his target.

He said: 'I harnessed my drive, I always wanted to be able to win and be on top of any situation.

'I took my business background and I said 'how can I make this into a competition? By doing all of those things I was able to spur myself on.

'That's where Nutracheck came in - I could count calories and say 'I did not hit the no I wanted to hit today, I can do better tomorrow.'

He swapped takeaways for lean meat and vegetables, started walking and going to the gym, and within a year he had lost almost 9st (57kg).

Nutracheck is an app that allows people to keep a food diary and tot up their daily calorie intake via a picture database of over 160,000 UK foods.

It allows users to scan in the barcode of a product, or enter it manually, and it will calculate the amount of calories in it.

Nutritional advice and support is also available. 

The Nutracheck team has released a version of the App specifically for the USA.

'My top tips are really simple: buy a digital scale to weigh what you eat – don't guess! And just be honest, which means logging everything you eat and drink.

'If you try to guess what 100g of something looks like you are likely to underestimate – so just get used to weighing your portions accurately and noting it all down.

'You learn tricks as you go along so you never feel hungry. Like swede doesn't have a lot of calories, but if fills you up.

'So I eat some swede and then I can save more calories for chicken, which I love.'

Today, he weighs 13st (83kg). His blood pressure has stabilised, he is no longer prediabetic and he is determined to maintain this healthy weight.

He says he is now able to exercise and buy fashionable clothes.

'I would think nothing of walking to the shops now. My idea of a recreational walk is six milew, before it was six feet,' he said.

He says he has also found experienced the joy of buying fashionable clothes.

'I've replaced my clothes with things that are more my style – I can go to normal shops where there's more choice now.

'I went to a 'big and tall' shop without thinking recently to buy a golf shirt and they said 'We can't help you. You're too small for us'.

'And they sent me to Debenhams. It was great.'
