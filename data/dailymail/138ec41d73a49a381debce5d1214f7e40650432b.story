A lump of ice the size of a bowling ball has smashed through the roof of a home after falling from an aeroplane.

Jeff Scriven, 56, was working from home when he heard an 'almighty bang' and found the huge ball shattered on his conservatory floor.

The IT manager believes the ball of ice fell from a plane as it flew over Clanfield, Hampshire.

'Lucky': Jeff Scriven expressed his relief that no-one was in the room when the 6ft by 2.5ft panel smashed

And the father-of-two said it could have been disastrous if someone was standing in the room when it happened.

He said: 'It’s just lucky no-one was in there at the time. There was an almighty bang and I could not comprehend what it was.

'There was glass everywhere, it had shattered a 6ft by 2.5ft double glazed panel in the roof.

'The hardwood bamboo floor has also been damaged, as has the central support which holds it all up.

'It is clearly an ice ball - it was the size of a bowling ball - and I believe it came from a plane.

'I could not imagine where else it could have come from. We get a lot of planes overhead but we don’t normally hear them, just see them.'

Experts believe the chunks of ice are frozen rainwater or toilet waste which fall from planes as they fly over.

Mr Scriven has received a letter from the Civil Aviation Authority saying the incident had been logged.

But it added it was unlikely the responsible airline will ever be identified. The damage is estimated at several thousand pounds and Mr Scriven will be out of pocket with a £50,000 insurance excess and will lose his no claims bonus.
