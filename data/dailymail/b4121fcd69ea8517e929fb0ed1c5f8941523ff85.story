Disgraced businessman Geoffrey Edelsten certainly has a type. His new flame, already labelled Brynne 2.0, is the spitting image of the millionaire's 31-year-old ex-wife.

But Gabi Grecko is more than just Brynne 2.0.

The buxom blonde, whose outfit choices rarely leave much to the imagination, is based in New York and goes by several titles.

They include model, DJ Gigi Vamp and party girl star of reality television series The Club Kids of New York.

The show gives an insight into the life of the fun-loving 24-year-old, who then modeled a different hairdo, with flaming red locks.

In a preview for the show, shared on Grecko's YouTube account, rival club promoter Matt describes the her as 'a fiery red head with a very well-endowed chest ... definitely someone I can have fun with'.

And it appears that Matt was right on the money.

The video shows the then-red head downing shots at a house party with Matt, whilst the pair flirted and agreed that they'd have a 'wild' night.

The pair then get cosy by the fireplace as they look into each others eyes and share a sneaky kiss.

The party moves on to a nightclub called W.i.P in New York's SoHo, where Matt notices Gabi locking lips with another girl on the dance floor. But Matt appears largely unfazed, even kissing the new girl himself.

She also features in the reality television series the Club Kids of New York, alongside club promoter Matt

So Matt simply joins in on the action

Perhaps Gabi's party days are over now that she's made her entrance as the new girlfriend of 71-year-old Edelsten.

Whilst it still remains unclear how the two met, they made their first official outing at the funeral service of football great Tom Hafey at the MCG in Melbourne on Monday.

Gabi turned heads at the sombre affair with her unconventional and revealing outfit.

It's not the first time Mr Edelsten's been spotted with a mystery blond. The 71-year-old was snapped with a much younger woman in Los Angeles not long after he and Brynne split.
