Prisoners approaching the end of their sentences are being offered HGV lessons to stop them reoffending once freed.

Mainstream Training has formed a partnership with Category D HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.

Inmates deemed suitable are sent on courses, including for HGVs and forklift trucks, at the company's base in Sittingbourne or at the jail, and are predominantly classroom-based.

Funding for the lessons comes from charitable donations, including from the Royal London Society and the Salvation Army - and has to be paid back once jobs are found.

Sheppey residents criticised the scheme, with one describing it as a ‘slap in the face of the ordinary hard-working person’.

However, Paul Tolley, senior operations manager at Mainstream, said the aim was to help offenders into jobs on the outside to stop them reoffending.

He said once offenders pass their tests and get jobs, they have to pay back the money to help another inmate rehabilitate.

Mr Tolley said: 'It's not a freebie. These aren't free driving lessons for personal use. Once their term is up, they are given a small amount of money and told basically to get on with it.

'What we have done is put a programme in place to help get them trained, get a CV together and help them get a job.

'A person is less likely to reoffend if they are in a full-time job. The money used to train them will be paid back to help the next person rehabilitate.

'It's like a conveyor belt system.

'We are trying to help people to stop them re-offending as there are often prisoners who leave jail with a small amount of money, no family and no job and are back in prison in a week.'

Since the scheme started in January, half of around the 30 people who have been trained have found employment, Mr Tolley added.

He said helping train suitable prisoners with HGV licences is helping to plug the shortfall of up to 100,000 drivers in the logistics industry.

The charity, Victim Support, welcomed steps that help prisoners gain a job and rehabilitate themselves.

A spokesman said: 'What victims want more than anything else is not to be a victim in the first place and for the criminal not to do it again.

'Schemes that are proven to genuinely cut the chances of someone reoffending help to achieve that, such as the restorative justice work we do where a criminal has to meet their victim.

'Helping a prisoner to get a job after they've served their time is also a helpful step in their rehabilitation.'
