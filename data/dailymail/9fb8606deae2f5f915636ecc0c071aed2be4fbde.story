Sentencing: Christopher Brassington arriving at Leeds Crown Court yesterday

A father crashed a pick-up truck into an Italian restaurant after finding out the owner was in a  relationship with his former lover, a court heard.

Christopher Brassington, 39, was more than twice the drink-drive limit when he drove a friend’s vehicle through the restaurant window at speed, sending tables and chairs flying.

He then turned the 4x4 around inside the restaurant and tried to drive back out.

When police arrived, Brassington, who was banned from driving at the time, was still behind the wheel and had to be pulled out through the window.

His lawyer described it as a scene from a Quentin Tarantino film. Brassington caused £120,000 of damage to the restaurant, which was closed at the time.

A former multi-millionaire, he turned to drink after seeing his property empire crash, Leeds Crown Court was told.

The defendant had spent the evening of the rampage in January drinking with former business partner Nigel Coxan in a pub in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

Matthew Harding, prosecuting, said the two men began discussing Brassington’s former long-term girlfriend and her new relationship with Glyn Margrave, the owner of Rinaldis restaurant in Wakefield.

‘They were speaking about relationships and Mr Coxan said the mother of the defendant’s children was having a relationship with an individual who owned Rinaldis,’ said Mr Harding.

‘He thought he [Brassington] was aware of the relationship but the defendant appeared surprised.’

They left the pub at 11pm and although they had arrived in Mr Coxan’s Toyota pick-up, they had intended to find alternative transport home as both had drunk six pints of lager, the court was told.

But Brassington took the keys from his friend and began driving, with Mr Coxan in the passenger seat pleading with him to stop. He drove down the M1 and ended up outside Rinaldis restaurant, which was in darkness.

The defendant revved the car five times, said ‘I’m sorry’ and accelerated through the restaurant window. Mr Harding said: ‘Both men were screaming as glass was shattering and tables and chairs were being scattered.’

The property developer flew into a jealous rage after consuming six pints of lager and learning the owner of Rinaldi's is Wakefield was having an affair with his wife

Brassington muttered the words 'I'm sorry' to friend Nigel Coxon, who was sitting in the passenger seat, before accelerating towards the window as both men screamed

The truck went 15ft inside before 
coming to rest against a pillar, which supported the ceiling.  An alarm 
went off and Brassington stayed in the driver’s seat, hitting the 
accelerator and spinning  the wheels.

‘Staff at a nearby supermarket saw him trying to do a three-point turn to get out of the premises,’ said Mr Harding.

When
 police arrived Brassington was still spinning the wheels, but he turned
 off the engine and threw his arms up as if to hand himself over. Mr 
Margrave later told police he knew Brassington and recalled an incident 
some years previously where the defendant told him: ‘We will sort 
matters out man to man.’

But he had not taken the threat seriously, said Mr Harding.

The owner of Rinaldi's restaurant in Wakefield, Glyn Margrave estimated the repair bill totalled more than £120,000 - to cover damages and a loss of earnings

Brassington, driving his friend's pick-up truck, reversed at speed embedding the vehicle around five metres inside the building

The truck only came to a stop when it smashed into a pillar supporting the ceiling

Owner of Rinaldi's, Mr Margrave, had to close the restaurant for a week to allow for the repairs to be carried out

When
 interviewed by police, Brassington, of Huddersfield, said he could not 
remember the incident. He admitted drink-driving, dangerous driving, 
criminal damage, driving whilst disqualified and driving without 
insurance.

Judge Shaun 
Spencer deferred sentence for six months to see how Brassington 
responded to medical treatment for his personal problems.

The judge told Brassington he was clearly ‘upset’ about the other man ‘pursuing a relationship with your former partner’.

‘It
 is quite clear to me that the commission of these offences was 
motivated by malice,’ said Judge Spencer. ‘It had its roots in your 
manic condition at the time and was also fuelled by alcohol.’

Brassington, left, said psychological treatment he was receiving, including electric shock therapy meant he had suffered memory loss. Right, his former home in Huddersfield

Jonathan
 Walker, defending, said Brassington built up a property business worth 
millions in his 20s and 30s before having a breakdown in 2007.

Since
 then he has been suffering from bi-polar disorder, depression and has a
 drink problem. He was convicted of drink-driving in 2001 and 2011.

Commenting on the incident, Mr Walker said it was ‘a moment of madness’.

‘The
 couple split up a number of years earlier and hadn’t seen one another 
for some considerable time,’ he said. He claimed it was not the 
‘hot-headed actions of someone seeking revenge’.

‘This was a bizarre, freakish scene which seems to have been taken from a Quentin Tarantino movie,’ said Mr Walker.
