Yahoo 7 News reports the woman has been charged with assault following the alleged incident.

Mr Rees said he wouldn't be commenting on the incident but released a statement saying, 'I hold genuine fears for people's safety'.

'The matter is in the hands of the police.'

Mr Rees was dumped as NSW Premier by Labor colleagues in 2010, in favour of Kristina Keneally.

Former NSW Premier was involved in a confrontation at a suburban shopping centre, where it is alleged a woman struck him a number of times

Mr Rees relinquished his role as Shadow Police Minister last year after revelations that he had an three month extra-marital affair with a constituent. It's believed they had become involved after he offered her advice on a legal matter involving her son.

He will retire from public office after 17 years at the March state election.
