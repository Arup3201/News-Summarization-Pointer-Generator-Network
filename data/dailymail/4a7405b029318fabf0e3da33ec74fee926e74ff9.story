Two carjackers who fled after ramming a stolen SUV into a family selling fruit for their church, killing three young siblings, were still on the run Saturday as the reward for their capture topped $100,000.

The children's 34-year-old mother, Keisha Williams, remained in critical condition at Temple University Hospital.

Her slain children were identified as 15-year-old Keiearra Williams, 10-year-old Thomas Reed and 7-year-old Terrence Moore.

The two suspects fled on foot after crashing the stolen car Friday morning at a North Philadelphia intersection.

Three children were killed and three people critically injured when a hijacked car lost control and hit a group of people near a fruit stand, according to police

They had first carjacked a real estate agent at gunpoint and later forced her into the back seat of her SUV, authorities said.

The
 45-year-old agent was also hospitalized afterward, as was a 65-year-old
 woman helping the family with the fruit stand. Their names weren't 
being released, and their conditions weren't immediately available 
Saturday.

'All they said was
 my grandma got hit, and there were bodies everywhere,' Sakina Brown, 
granddaughter of the 65-year-old victim, told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

'My heart was about to jump out of my chest.'

She
 said her grandmother had seen the vehicle coming and tried 
unsuccessfully to get out of the away. She suffered a broken ankle and 
bruised sternum when she was struck. The group held the fundraiser every
 week to raise money for a church effort to turn the corner lot into a 
playground, Brown said.

Eyewitnesses
 who rushed to help the injured described a gruesome scene. One woman 
rushed to the boys, finding one with only a light pulse and the other 
with none.

The 10-year-old died at the scene. The other two were pronounced dead at hospitals.

'Three innocent children had their lives taken,' Philadelphia Homicide Capt. James Clark said of the siblings.

The
 reward for the suspects' arrest has reached $110,000, thanks to 
contributions from the city and the Fraternal Order of Police. Police 
have also asked nearby businesses for surveillance videos, and were 
getting tips from the public.

'There
 are no words to describe how I feel right now,' said police 
Commissioner Charles Ramsey, 'but we do need to find these two guys'.

Police
 believe the suspects may have blown a tire as they turned a corner at 
high speed. The car ended up in a wooded area, its front end smashed 
against a stand of trees, about a mile from the carjacking scene.

Employees at Education Works, an educational nonprofit across the street from the wreck, ran to try to help the victims.

'I'm
 certified in first aid and CPR — my first instinct was to go to them,' 
said camp director Karen Payne, the woman who checked the boys' pulses. 'But I couldn't help.'

Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison described the mayor as heartbroken.

'The prayers of the city go out to this family,' he said.
