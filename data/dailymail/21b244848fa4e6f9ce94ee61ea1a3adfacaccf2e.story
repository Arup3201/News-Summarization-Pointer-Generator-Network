Sgt Charles Pilbeam, 30, is accused of forcing Somalian Abdi Ali-Ahmed to the ground to pick up pieces of paper from an interview room floor while on all fours

A police sergeant stamped on a mentally ill prisoner’s foot during a strip search and told him 'Welcome to Hackney’, a court heard today.

Sgt Charles Pilbeam, 30, is accused of forcing Somalian Abdi Ali-Ahmed to the ground to pick up pieces of paper from an interview room floor while on all fours.

At
 the time of the events, the man - who is in his 20s - was prevented 
getting dressed after a full strip-search by Pilbeam, it is claimed.

The
 alleged victim had ‘a difficult childhood’ in 
war-torn Somalia and suffers from multiple mental health issues.

He had not been arrested but was being served with a dispersal notice, having voluntarily given up a small bag of cannabis, Westminster Magistrates Court heard.

The court heard Pilbeam tried to cover-up the alleged incident at Shoreditch Police Station, east London.

He is aslo accused of telling trainee constable Cordelle Sailsman not to report the incident - which was witnessed by wo fully-qualified PCs.

Brian Sharkey and Rob Baker, saw the events and were interviewed under caution for alleged misconduct.

The men were never charged with any offence, but their accounts have already been branded ‘silent or very vague...on what actually happened’.

Prosecutor Dickon Reid said: ‘There are two allegations of assault on the same complainant, Mr Abdi Ali-Ahmed.

‘By way of background, he [Mr Ali-Ahmed] had been brought to the police station having been searched...he was strip-searched.

‘Towards the end of this search, the 
prosecution say Mr Pilbeam first of all deliberately stamped on the 
victim’s toes and also pulled him by the ear, twisted it and pulled him 
to the ground and demanded he pick up paper [the notice] he had ripped 
up.’

The dispersal notice, 
handed over in the presence of Pilbeam, PC Sailsman, PC Sharkey and PC 
Baker, required him leave the East London borough.

After Mr Ali-Ahmed, who had been drinking, told the officers to ‘f***’ off’, Pilbeam moved forward with ‘a purposeful march’.

The officer then crushed his alleged victim’s foot with his own, for ‘approximately one minute’, Mr Reid said.

‘Mr Baker tried to give him the dispersal form again. He ripped it up.’

Pilbeam then ‘stepped on the waistband’ of Mr Ali-Ahmed’s to prevent him from putting his trousers back on, Mr Reid added.

‘You
 are going to f*****g pick that up. This is my police station and you 
are going to pick it up’, Pilbeam allegedly ranted, adding: 'This is my 
clean police station, f*****g  pick it up.’

Prosecutor Dickon Reid told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'Towards the end of this search, the prosecution say Mr Pilbeam first of all deliberately stamped on the victim's toes and also pulled him by the ear, twisted it and pulled him to the ground and demanded he pick up paper [the notice] he had ripped up'

It is claimed that Pilbeam then grabbed his homeless victim by the ear, forced him to the ground and forced him to pick up individual shreds.

When Mr Ali-Ahmed asked why he deserved this abuse, Pilbeam allegedly replied ‘Welcome to Hackney’.

PC Sailsman, who was training at the time but now fully qualified, said he was ‘very certain’ the assaults took place on March 2 last year.

He claimed PC Baker ‘turned and looked at me and raised his eyebrows’ while their superior attacked the prisoner.

PC Sailsman said Pilbeam later told him not to report the incident and said: ‘I’m sorry to have put you in that situation. Don’t make notes, I will write it up.’

The softly-spoken officer added: ‘I felt quite intimidated at the time.’

PC Sailsman immediately reported the events to a superior at Stoke Newington police station.

He recounted Pilbeam was ‘breathing heavily, almost panting’, before the alleged assaults.

PC Sailsman added that Pilbeam also stamped on Mr Ali-Ahmed’s shin.

He said when Mr Ali-Ahmed asked what the dispersal notice was, PC Baker replied ‘We don’t want you in Hackney’.

PC Sailsman said later he heard Pilbeam on the phone to an inspector, calling Mr Ali-Ahmed a ‘local sl*g’ and reassuring him he would write up the incident.

Defence counsel Guy Ladenburg suggested Mr Ali-Ahmed was potentially violent, but PC Sailsman maintained he was ‘very compliant’ and seated at all times.

‘In my opinion, he was scared’, PC Sailsman commented.

Pilbeam, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, denies two offences of common assault.

The trial continues.
