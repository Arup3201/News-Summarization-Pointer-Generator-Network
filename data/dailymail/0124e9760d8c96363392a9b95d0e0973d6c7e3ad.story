Boris Johnson is being lined up as a key weapon for the Tories in the next general election campaign.

David Cameron is prepared to turn to the London Mayor to win over voters who are currently put off by the party.

Senior Tories say Mr Johnson has agreed to play a leading role as a ‘frontman’ in the campaign. He is expected to hold solo rallies across the country as well as join Mr Cameron on the trail.

Allies of the Prime Minister 
recognise that they have to turn to the most popular figure in their 
party if they are to have any chance of winning a majority.

Mr Cameron has already hired 
strategist Lynton Crosby, who masterminded Mr Johnson’s two mayoral 
election victories, to help run the campaign in 2015.

A senior Tory source said: ‘David 
wants Boris to play a big role. He knows Boris is a real asset – he’s 
hugely popular with Conservative voters and a real crowd-pleaser. Boris 
is a one-off and he’ll be brilliant at rallying support.

‘And Boris is very keen to do what he
can to help. Everyone is going to have to play their part if we want to
win. Boris is up for the challenge.’

A senior Labour figure has admitted that the country’s benefits bill is ‘unsustainable’.

Liam Byrne, the party’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘Welfare spending went up during the crash. That is supposed to happen. The problem is that it has not come back down and has carried on rising by 2 per cent a year. That is not sustainable.’ 

He suggested that Labour voters want to see the party get tougher on welfare, adding: ‘At the moment they don’t find the system is giving help to the right people and that frustrates them. We have to listen to that.’ 

But a Conservative spokesman said: ‘It is frankly a joke that Liam Byrne is saying Labour will get tough on welfare – this from the party that hiked welfare spending by 60 per cent while they were in government.’

Mr Johnson has proved he can win in the capital where Labour still maintains an electoral stranglehold.

He is also popular with voters in the
North and blue collar communities who Mr Cameron has failed to convince
that the party is on their side.

Recent polls have put the Tories as low as 24 per cent in the polls, just two points ahead of UKIP.

Insiders also expect Mr Johnson to energise the party’s  grassroots base alienated by Mr Cameron’s support for gay marriage.

While the London Mayor himself also 
backs gay marriage, he is seen as a ‘feel-good figure’ by the party who 
will inspire a mass turnout from the shires where Mr Cameron has 
triggered defections to UKIP.

That common touch was on display 
yesterday, when Mr Johnson met Hollywood actor and pop star Will Smith 
and son Jaden at City Hall for the Mayor’s Leadership Clubs, which offer
extracurricular activities for 10- to 14-year-olds.

Revealing to Mr Smith that he had 
written his own rap song he said: ‘My first rap, I haven’t really set it
to music yet. Perhaps with your help. It was about the Queen’s 
Jubilee.’ Mr Smith joked in reply: ‘That was big in the hip-hop 
community.’

While both sides claim relations 
between Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson are good, the latter has recently made
it clear that he does covet the Tory leadership and No 10 officials 
often struggle to hide their irritation when he speaks out against 
government policy.

Despite this, the Prime Minister’s 
senior advisers have convinced him he should call ‘all hands to the 
pump’ if he wants to keep Ed Miliband out of Downing Street.
