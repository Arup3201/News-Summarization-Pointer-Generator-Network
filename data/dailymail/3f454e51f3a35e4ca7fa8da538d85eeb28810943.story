Mario Balotelli  had just received a pass from Raheem Sterling and, as he took possession, Lazar Markovic began scampering down the flank.

To get Liverpool firmly on the front foot, all Balotelli had to do was take control and usher the ball out wide. Instead, he dithered. The Italian tried to run through the middle on his own but the ball became stuck between his feet and Basle defender Fabian Schar comfortably dispossessed him.

On the touchline, Brendan Rodgers went berserk. Flinging his arms out, hollering at Balotelli and asking for an explanation as to why a promising attack had so needlessly fallen down, he left his new £16million striker aware of his displeasure.

Yet this was not an isolated incident. Moments later, when Philippe Coutinho dithered and surrendered the ball, Rodgers again let rip, leaving the Brazilian with no ambiguity over how disappointed he was to see another break go askew.

It became a recurring theme. Tugging at the jacket of his black suit, folding his arms firmly and shuffling from side to side, Rodgers’ frustration at watching Liverpool fail to get near the breathless standards they set last season became more apparent with each passing second in St Jakob Park.

Having masterminded one of the most exciting campaigns in the club’s recent history, Rodgers is impatient for his new look team to reach the levels that saw them pummel opponents to submission before they even realised what was happening.

‘We’ve not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there are a number of reasons why,’ Rodgers had explained when arriving in Basle on Tuesday. ‘We are integrating new players to a new culture and we’ve had injuries to key players. We have a big vision and an idea where we are going.’

Much to his consternation, however, it is not happening how he wants it to. The rhythm and the swagger is missing from their attack but, most worryingly, the defence continues to be Liverpool’s biggest flaw and the concession of another soft goal prompted Rodgers’ most colourful reaction.

After Marco Streller had gleefully pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard area to put Basle in control of the game, Rodgers spun on his heels, scrunched up his face and mouthed his displeasure to his assistants Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh.

Rodgers could contend – just – with Liverpool lacking fluency going forward if things were solid at the back but their inability to keep a clean sheet is becoming more and more problematic and it is going to leave them with mountains to climb, both at home and in Europe.

In five of their last six games, they have conceded goals that can be kindly described as cheap and it says everything for the state of flux that Liverpool have only kept one clean sheet in their nine fixtures in all competitions. It is not good enough.

To progress in Europe, teams first and foremost have to be solid and difficult to break down. One bad night and all the hard work will be brought crashing down to earth and this latest disjointed rear-guard performance has thrown Group B wide open.

Liverpool now face a double-header against Real Madrid, arguably the most dazzling attacking unit in world football, and if they play as they have been, they will be stuck on three points with two games to go, away to Ludogorets (November 26) before hosting Basle on December 9.

Tradition demands that Liverpool extricate themselves from difficult positions and their European history is filled with glorious come-from-behind moments. History, though, will not save them this time if Rodgers does not find a cure for his side’s back ache.
