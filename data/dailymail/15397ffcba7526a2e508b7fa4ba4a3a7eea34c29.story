Sprinter Adam Gemili holds up his Olympic Games pass, with a photos of someone completely different

He's one of the most talked-about British athletes competing in the Olympics and Great Britain's great hope in the 100metres.

But someone in the Locog security team hasn't read all the hype about teenage sprinter Adam Gemili.

When the running sensation arrived in London to pick up his Games pass - it had a photo of someone completely different on it.

The confused junior world champion posted a photo of his pass, and the mystery man, on his Twitter page - and asked followers for help identifying the fake Adam Gemili.

He wrote: 'My Olympic accreditation to get into the games, who even is this guy?!?!?'

Many of Team GB's track and field stars have been based at a training camp in Portugal, and are arriving at the Olympic Village just days before they're due to compete.

And organisers admit Gemili's mix-up wasn't an isolated incident.

Particularly after a series of security fiascoes.

British Olympic Association deputy chef de mission, Sir Clive Woodward, told BBC Sport: 'It's happened a few times to be fair and I've tried to meet most athletes when they arrive to solve any problems.

'It is a big issue from a security point of view as the picture has to match the person so I know we've dealt with it as it came to us last night.'

The 18-year-old is being hailed as one of Britain's 'golden generation' of future superstars, but he only started running seriously in January.

The Londoner, who is currently 
studying a BTEC diploma in sport at Barking and Dagenham College, only 
quit football last November to focus on running.

Before that the teenager's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track.

Adam Gemili raced to victory in the World Junior Championships last month, setting a new personal best of 10.05

The former Dartford Grammar School pupil -Â  who is of Moroccan and Iranian descent -
 was signed up by Chelsea when he was just eight years old and spent 
seven years with the European Champions before switching to his local 
club Dagenham and Redbridge.

He
 spent part of last season on loan at nearby Blue Square Bet South side 
Thurrock, but was still training with Dagenham and Redbridge until the 
end of the year, when he swapped his football boots for runners spikes.

His transition to sprinter was complete earlier this month when Gemili won the World Junior Championships with a phenomenal time of 10.05 seconds.
