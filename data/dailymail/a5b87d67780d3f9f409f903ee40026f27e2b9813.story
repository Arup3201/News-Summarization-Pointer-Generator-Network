For years it existed only in the wildest realms of science fiction.

But now a team of leading roboticists
have created a real bionic man - complete with artificial organs, 
synthetic blood and robot limbs goes.

The astonishing creation incorporates some of the latest advances 
in prosthetic technology, as well as an artificial pancreas, kidney, 
spleen and trachea, and a functional blood circulatory system.

The 6ft 6in (2m) humanoid shares quite a bit in common with Steve Austin, the original 'bionic man' from the cult 1970s TV series the Six Million Dollar Man.

But costing almost £640,000, it is cheaper.

Known as Rex – short for robotic 
exoskeleton – his hi-tech frame is made up of an array of artificial limbs 
and organs from around the world.

It was assembled
for a new Channel 4 documentary, How 
To Build A Bionic Man and will go on display at London's Science Museum 
this week.

The Science Museum exhibit opening on 
Thursday will explore changing perceptions of human identity against the
background of rapid progress in bionics.

In the documentary, to be screened at
9pm on Thursday, experts at the forefront of the research talk to Swiss
social psychologist Bertolt Meyer.

Mr Meyer was born without a left hand and has a £30,000 bionic replacement with the ability to grip and twist.

But
although his hand is the most advanced on the market, it could soon be 
obsolete. In the programme Meyer tries out the much more advanced 
modular prosthetic limb (MPL), which teaches itself how to recognise 
tiny control signals from the upper arm.

He
also meets teams of British scientists who are restoring sight to the 
blind by implanting microchips in their retinas, and building artificial
organs to replace failing lungs, kidneys, pancreases and spleens.

'I've looked around for new bionic 
technologies, out of personal interest, for a very long time and I think
that until five or six years ago nothing much was happening,' said 
Mr Meyer.

'Then suddenly we are now at a point where we can build a body that is great and beautiful in its own special way.'

David
Glover, senior commissioning editor for Channel 4 Factual, said: 
'Following Bertolt Meyer, who has a bionic arm himself, as he 
investigates the reality of building a bionic human takes this 
brilliantly made documentary into new territory. If what scientists can 
do now is jaw-dropping, the future is mind-boggling.'

The project is supported by a Wellcome Trust People Award which aims to help the public explore biomedical science.

Clare Matterson, director of medical humanities and engagement at the charity, said, quoting from the introduction to the One Million Dollar Man: 'Throughout history people have always sought to enhance themselves to overcome disabilities or to become 'bigger, better, stronger and faster'.

'Science is making aspirations and even fantasy ever more possible. We only have to look back at last summer's Paralympics to see how transforming technology has become.

'Whilst exploring the latest medical developments, How To Build A Bionic Man hints at the implications these advances may raise for mankind in the future.'
