Prince Andrew is said to be furious at being relegated to a walk-on bit part in the family. Edward is exasperated that his wife Sophie is no longer the Queen’s favourite.

But one of the royals is overwhelmed by relief as crowds continue to swarm around William, Kate and baby George on their tour Down Under: the Duchess of Cornwall.

As she enters the tenth year of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, the former Mrs Parker ­Bowles ‘couldn’t be happier to see Kate ­taking all the limelight’, says one of her ­closest friends.

The Queen is said to have grown fond of the Duchess of Cornwall and has been impressed by her 'un-showy' way

For she knows that it deflects attention from what many now see as her remorseless progress towards becoming Queen Camilla alongside King Charles. Carefully laid state plans currently rule this out, of course, and she has to settle for being called Princess Consort. But she has triumphed before.

She was said to have had no wish to destroy Princess Diana’s marriage to Charles — yet it was destroyed. She felt no need to be more than Prince Charles’s ­mistress as long as she had him to herself — yet she married him.

She had no desire for the unnecessary trappings of a royal title — yet these days we know her as HRH the Duchess of Cornwall.

She never expected to be mentioned alongside the Queen, Prince Philip and Charles in Sunday prayers for the Royal Family in churches, yet this is under discussion. Oh yes, and for years friends have said she has no wish to be Queen . . .

Of course, the driving force behind her inexorable royal progress is Prince Charles. And who could doubt the success of his softly-softly strategy as Camilla took her place at the ­historic State Banquet for the ­President of Ireland last week.

She looked for all the world like a Queen-in-waiting — her carefully dyed fair hair swept up and crowned with the late Queen Mother’s favourite, glittering Greville tiara. She sat graciously at the heart of matters, on the right of diminutive Irish President Michael Higgins, while the Queen was on his left.

Today, it would seem churlish for anyone in royal circles to harbour resentment against a woman who is approaching her 67th birthday in July and who has, quite obviously, settled comfortably into the public role that arrived late in life.

But friends and admirers of Diana continue to find the ease with which Camilla has been welcomed into royal life as the Princess of Wales’s replacement very hard to swallow.

It will be even harder for them to learn that the Queen herself — who once memorably dubbed Camilla ‘that wicked woman’ — is understood now to ‘genuinely like her’.

‘Why should anyone be surprised?’ says one of Camilla’s circle. ‘They have a lot in common, after all. They love horses and the countryside.

‘And the Queen has been impressed with Camilla’s un-showy way of going about her duties. Just like the Queen herself, Camilla doesn’t like grand appearances for their own sake and doesn’t have to be competitive like the rest of the family.’

Though Camilla was divorced from her first husband, the security of her position ironically owes much to the Queen’s own happy marriage and belief that it has taken two ­people to create the brilliant success of her reign. The Queen thinks that, for Charles to be a successful ­monarch, he will need someone to support him as Philip has done so wonderfully over six decades.

Timing, they say, is everything, and Camilla was conveniently at the Prince of Wales’s side as the Queen noticeably began scaling back her role last year following the triumphant, but tiring, Diamond Jubilee. The Duchess looked very much at home sitting with Charles on two mini-thrones alongside the Queen and Philip at the State Opening Of Parliament last May. And in November when, for the first time, Charles represented the Queen, who will be 88 on Monday, welcoming Commonwealth heads of government at their get-together in Sri Lanka.

So just what is it that gives Camilla such confidence? After all, she knows that many still blame her for destroying Diana’s marriage.

The answer may come as a ­surprise. According to one of her closest friends: ‘Camilla knows the Queen is now depending on her.’

This is an extraordinary turn of events. Not so many years ago, the Queen feared that Charles’s mistress was putting the throne in jeopardy. So anxious was she about the public’s reaction to the Prince marrying Camilla, that she distanced herself from the ceremony at Windsor’s Guildhall in April 2005, only attending the blessing afterwards.

Yet last week the couple sailed through their ninth wedding anniversary apparently without a care in the world. ‘Camilla’s value to the Queen lies in her ability to manage Charles’s moods and frustrations,’ explains a palace aid.

She performs the key function of ‘propping up’ the man who has been heir to the throne for a record 62 years as he goes through what an aide describes as ‘one of his ­periodic bouts of gloom over where he is heading’.

‘At such times,’ says the aide, ‘the Prince feels he is an insignificant figure trapped between an immensely popular monarch and a glamorous young couple. Only Camilla is capable of bringing him out of these glooms.’

After the Queen’s Jubilee in 2012, Charles established an ‘understanding’ with his aged parents giving him special responsibilities to ­fashion the monarchy in his own way when he accedes.

‘Despite this, he still has a habit of periodically becoming preoccupied with being the longest-running understudy in history,’ says one close figure. ‘And it doesn’t help him that the world’s attention on, and fascination with, William, Kate and baby George is growing by the day as crowds swarm around them Down Under.

‘I don’t know how he would have coped without Camilla. It’s probably why he needed her as his ­mistress for all those years. She knows how to keep him going.’ Little wonder the Queen wants her mentioned in Church of England prayers.

Not everyone, however, is as enthusiastic about the changing pecking order in The Firm.

The break-up of Charles’s marriage to Diana, and Prince Andrew’s with Fergie, meant that for several years Prince Edward’s wife, former public relations girl Sophie Rhys-Jones — the Countess of Wessex — was the royal woman next in line of precedence to the Queen. Out of her daughters-in-law, Sophie is her favourite.

‘Sophie had a taste of being the woman next in line to the Queen and quite liked it,’ says one who has observed her at close quarters. ‘Then Camilla married Charles, pushing her down a notch, and after this Kate Middleton arrived as Duchess of Cambridge, pushing her down the list even further.

‘She doesn’t like it. Heaven knows how she’ll react if Andrew ever gets round to remarrying Fergie.’

Camilla has no such worries. As the wife of the Prince of Wales, her position as second only to the Queen is unassailable.

‘She lets people think this sort of thing matters not a jot to her,’ says an aide, ‘but the truth is, attention is addictive. Everyone in the Royal Family likes the limelight.’

Brotherly harmony has been replaced by bitterness and a sense of ‘Princes at war’ behind palace walls. Charles continues his policy of slimming down the monarchy, although his ‘magnificent seven’ of royals who really matter in the ­Succession — the Queen and Philip, himself and Camilla, William, Kate and Harry — is now eight with its youngest star, George.

‘Camilla’s enhanced importance is petrol on the flames,’ says one close figure. ‘Andrew in particular will never get used to being permanently upstaged, and he is fuming about his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie being pushed to the margins of royal life. He is constantly reminding ­people they are the only two ‘blood Princesses’ of their generation. He thinks it is is disgraceful.

‘Edward is furious that Sophie now has to curtsey to Camilla. Anne, though, couldn’t care less.’

Through all this, the former maitresse en titre glides effortlessly beside the Prince of Wales, soothing his brow one moment, cajoling him the next. If she is eventually crowned Queen Camilla, will it be his triumph, or hers?
