Liverpool's poor performance in this season's Champions League has dealt the Anfield club a seedings blow for the Europa League last-32 draw.

As a result of being one of the four worst performing third-placed teams, Brendan Rodgers' side are unseeded for the draw, which will be held in Nyon on Monday at noon.

The Europa League has added importance this season with the winners receiving entry to next season's Champions League.

And with Liverpool currently languishing in ninth in the Premier League, many consider this to be their last shot at qualifying for UEFA's flagship club competition next season.

But a number of potential tough draws await on Monday due to their unseeded status, including a reunion with former manager Rafael Benitez at Napoli.

Nine teams have already secured a seeding for Monday's draw by virtue of winning their Europa League group or being one of the four third-placed teams in the Champions League with the best record.

They include Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan, Zenit St Petersburg, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina.

Napoli will also be seeded if they can clinch top spot in Group I with a home win against Slovan Bratislava on Thursday night.

Although city rivals Everton will also be seeded after winning Group H, there will be no Liverpool derby in the last-32 as teams from the same country cannot play each other at this stage.

It could, however, happen if both teams progress to the last 16, at which stage country protection is removed and the draw is free.

There will be no 'Battle of Britain' between Liverpool and Celtic as the Scottish club could only finish second in Group D and so will be unseeded.

La Liga clubs Sevilla and Villarreal are potential opponents for Liverpool if they can go top of their respective groups on Thursday.

A match against Henning Berg's Legia Warsaw is also a possibility if the Polish club seal first place in Group L with a draw at home against Trabzonspor.

If Liverpool go all the way and win the trophy in Warsaw on May 27, they would enter next season's Champions League  at the earliest in the play-offs.

There is a possibility, though, that the Europa League winners will go straight into the group stages if this season's Champions League victors qualify automatically for group entry through their own domestic league.

The Europa League last-32 first legs will be held on February 19 with the unseeded team at home first, before travelling away for the second leg seven days later.
