A British marketing rep who was sacked by the Jamaican Tourist Board after an outburst on Facebook about her father's brutal murder on the Caribbean island has won her case for unfair dismissal.

Zoe Bennett, 35, from Preston, Lancashire, made the comments after she discovered that Errol Bennett, 59, had bled to death after being attacked by machete-wielding intruders while on holiday.

Weeks later, she was suspended due to 'comments on Facebook', which she says the board thought were 'detrimental to Jamaica'. She was finally dismissed by the board in December 2013.

But Ms Bennett has now been awarded £19,000 in compensation from the Jamaican Tourist Board, after a hearing ruled it had been wrong to sack her.

Speaking after her victory at the hearing in London, Zoe claimed it had been a 'personal vendetta'.

The mother-of-three said: 'I'm delighted to win the case because I can now put it behind me and concentrate on getting justice for my dad.

'It was ludicrous right from the word go. I still can't believe what I did was seen as misconduct. I suppose they felt what I said was detrimental to Jamaica.

'The last few years have been terrible. My dad died in horrific circumstances, and then I've had all these problems at work, which I believe were actually a personal vendetta against me.

'I worked for the company for eight years and dedicated so much to them. All my hard years of work just feel like they've been wasted. I've been plagued by this for so long, I want to move forward now.' 

Ms Bennett had posted three separate messages on the social media site, one of which was on the day she found out her father had been killed. 

Retired Errol Snr, also from Preston, was attacked on December 17 while on a winter break at his villa in the parish of Hector's River on the east coast of Jamaica. 

The former upholsterer, who moved to Britain from Jamaica in 1967, suffered 15 separate injuries – including deep wounds to his head and torso.

After his death, Ms Bennett posted three separate messages on Facebook, one of which was written on the day she found out about her father and promised to 'avenge' his death

Ms Bennett, pictured here with her brother and father, was sacked from her position when she returned from Jamaica after identifying her father's body 

In that post, Ms Bennett pledged to 'avenge' his death and said: 'The b******* have murdered my dad in Jamaica. My heartbeat, my life has gone.'

In a second post, Ms Bennett criticised the Jamaican police for being 'slow in their uptake' on the investigation.

She said: 'All I want is justice. But the police are slow on the uptake even though they have a witness statement.'

And in the third she announced she was flying out to Jamaica even though her own life had been threatened, saying 'The b******* can try and kill me too – but f*** them. I will have my eyes open'.  

The single mother departed for Jamaica the next day, while on her scheduled Christmas holidays, to identify her father's body. 

The mother-of-three, pictured at her father's grave, said she is glad the tribunal is over so she can focus of getting justice for her father 

But in a phone call to her regional director at the Jamaican Tourism Board on December 19, she was told that officials had seen the Facebook comments and she would be spoken to about them on her return.

Then, on January 5, she received a letter from the tourist board telling her that she had been suspended due to 'comments on Facebook' and that it had launched an investigation.

The board, which is based in the Jamaican High Commission in London, asked her to attend a disciplinary meeting on January 13, two days after her father's funeral in Preston.

She had been told the disciplinary investigation will also cover 'breaches of confidence' after her suspension was reported in a local newspaper.

Today, Ms Bennett told how the company cancelled her suspension in February 2012, but that she remained on sick leave until her maternity leave started on April 1 of that year.

On April 1, 2013 she was due back to work. But when she requested phased return to work, Ms Bennett claims this request was never answered.

She launched a grievance claim against the company, which was combined with the existing disciplinary hearing for her Facebook comments.

On December 16, 2013 she was fired.

She appealed in January 2014 but the appeal was refused.

She attended a three-day Employment Tribunal hearing in London on September 29 where she was finally vindicated.

She won claims of unfair dismissal and wrongful dismissal against the Tourist Board. 

Ms Bennett, who has three children - Charnai, 18, Aliyah, four, and two-year-old Krystal - said: 'I won a £19,000 payout from the Tourist Board.

'The figure was actually higher but I negotiated to take a lower payment if they agreed never to appeal the decision.

'I think that's the biggest relief for me because it's been hanging over me for so long that I didn't want to have to be scared it would rear its head again.'

Speaking shortly after she was suspended, Zoe's brother Errol Jnr, had said: 'She has been devastated by this - what the Jamaican Tourist Board have done is disgusting.

'She has had so much to think about - but the Jamaican Tourist Board only seem interested in protecting the reputation of the country.' 

Her cousin Clifton Bennett, 33, was arrested nine months after the killing and, after several adjournments, is due to stand trial on November 25. 

MailOnline has contacted Jamaican Tourist Board for comment.
