QPR are in talks with striker Charlie Austin over a new £60,000-a-week contract but chairman Tony Fernandes insists the club’s new wage structure will not be broken.

Austin has scored 14 goals this season and is expected to be called up to the England squad next month. He has 18 months left on his contract. ‘Charlie is at an age where it’s important for him to make the right decision,’ said Fernandes.

‘I think his heart is with QPR. Obviously he’s thinking about whether we get relegated but I’m sure something will be worked out.’

Fernandes does not expect Austin to re-sign until the end of the season because of the precarious state of the club’s Premier League status.

Asked whether the club had a wage limit it cannot go above, Fernandes replied: ‘Spot on.’

The Malaysian also revealed that caretaker manager Chris Ramsey is the man he expects to appoint at the end of the season.

‘It’s Chris’s job really,’ he said. ‘As far as I’m concerned, he’s the manager and he’ll carry on as manager. He’s not on trial.’
