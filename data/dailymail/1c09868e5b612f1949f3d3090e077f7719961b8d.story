Unequal: Former polygamist Marion Munn is unhappy with the new ruling that decriminalizes the practice in Utah

A former sister wife has spoken out against the polygamous lifestyle, following a new federal ruling that decriminalizes the practice in Utah.

Marion Munn moved to Utah from Britain after converting to a fundamentalist Mormon faith, and says she was part of a plural marriage for 18 years

'The only way that I can explain it is like living with adultery on a daily basis, and having the woman come home,' Munn said.

'On top of that you have to smile and pretend that everything's okay because that's part of the culture too.'

The practice of polygamy has long been illegal in the United States, and especially persecuted in the state of Utah ever since the Mormon church decided to get rid of Joseph Smith's principal of plural marriage to become more mainstream.

But fundamentalist Mormons have continued the practice, with an estimated 40,000 Utah residents currently living in plural marriages.

Most of these families aren't polygamists in law, getting around the anti-polygamy statutes by legally marrying just one of their wives. 

In the past, the powerful Mormon church has worked through the state to shut down even these technically legal unions, forcibly breaking up the families using a law against cohabitation.

In a big win for the polygamists, a federal judge struck down that cohabitation rule in December, saying it violated the constitutional right to freedom of religion.

The ruling comes as bad news for Munn and other anti-polygamists who believe the marriages are inherently unequal, and often aren't entered into freely.

'Certainly
 within Mormon-based polygamy, it's not really much of a choice, because
 Mormon scriptures teach a woman that if she doesn't consent to living 
in polygamy, God's going to destroy her,' Munn explained.

'So for me going into it, I didn't personally want to live it, but I felt compelled to as a matter of faith.'

But polygamist families like the Dargers, who live just outside Salt Lake City, are excited they can now practice their lifestyle without the threat of arrest.

Out in the open: Joe Darger (second right) sits with his three wives (from left to right) Alina, Valerie and Vicki Darger at their home in Salt Lake City, Utah. The family has been public about their lifestyle since 2011

The Dargers have lived openly as a polygamist family ever since publishing a book about their lifestyle in 2011. 

For a long time after that, family patriarch Joe Darger says he worried he might be arrested under the anti-polygamy laws in the state.

'The fear when I went public four years ago, that fear was very real,' he said.

Their brood: There are 25 children in the Darger family, and 17 of the kids still live at home

'This
 is a third degree felony... this is serious prison time. My 
grandfathers were imprisoned, so that was a real impact that we felt.'

Joe has three wives, with a total of 25 children - 17 of which still live at home.

He married cousins Alina and Vicki in 1990, and ten years later married Vicki's twin sister Valerie when her first plural marriage broke down. She brought five children with her from that relationship.

Twins: Two of Dargers' wives are twin sisters. He initially married cousins Alina and Vicki in 1990, and married Vicki's twin sister Valerie ten years later

Alina Darger, who herself works as a lawyer on cases involving polygamy, says the ruling was a relief.

'That's
 been one of the great things about the ruling -- the decriminalization,
 and the judge saying basically that the state needs to stay out of 
people’s bedrooms,' she said.

Bad name: Fundamentalist Mormon leader Warren Jeffs represents the dark side of polygamy. He is currently serving a life sentence for sexual assault, including crimes against children

'As
 long as it's adults freely choosing what they want, then I don't feel 
it would be my place to tell somebody else you can't choose to love who 
you love.'

While the practice may work for the 
Dargers, a 2011 University of British Columbia study found polygamy 
causes greater levels of crime, violence, poverty and gender inequality 
in communities that practice it.

The
 United Nations has called for a ban, while polygamy has been at the 
center of notorious cases such as that of Warren Jeffs, the 
fundamentalist Mormon leader sentenced to life in prison for child 
sexual assault in 2011.

The 
main branch of the Mormon faith -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter 
Day Saints -- renounced the practice of polygamy in the 1890s under 
pressure from the US government.

While
 some offshoots of the religion continue the practice, exact numbers are
 hard to come by. Some estimates say that around 40,000 Utah residents 
live in plural marriages.

Utah's Attorney General Sean Reyes has yet to say whether he will challenge the federal court ruling on polygamy.

The
 state is also currently fighting to enforce a ban on gay marriage, 
which was ruled illegal in December by another federal judge.

But the decision comes as a big win for the estimated 40,000 Utah polygamists who can now live their lifestyle more openly
