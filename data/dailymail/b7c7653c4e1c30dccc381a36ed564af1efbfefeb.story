A 37-year-old woman has been arrested and charged after a 3-year-old girl she was supposed to watching drowned in a swimming pool.

Kariasa Thomas was arrested on Friday and charged with reckless injury to a child after Kanyce Giddings’ lifeless body was found in an apartment complex pool in the Red Bird neighborhood of Dallas.

According to the arrest warrant affidavit, on June 22 Thomas took her best friend’s four children, aged seven, six, five and three years old, to swim in the pool at her apartment complex.

Even though Kanyce, right in green, couldn't swim, Kariasa Thomas, left, told her to stand in the pool and watch her siblings swim

She also brought her 16-year-old daughter and husband, who is legally blind.

The affidavit states that when the group arrived at the pool about 7 p.m., it had already closed for the day, but they decided to stay after seeing other people still in the water.

Even though Thomas knew Kanyce could not swim and wasn’t wearing any kind of flotation device, she allowed the child to get in the water.

The affidavit states that Thomas told Kanyce to stand on the steps with her feet in the water while the other children swam.

When Thomas walked in the pool, she kicked the child's lifeless body with her foot

Thomas told detectives that she was sitting in a reclining chair a few feet from where the child was playing, but that instead of watching the girl, she logged onto Facebook on her phone for nearly 15 minutes while the children played.

In addition to being on her phone, she also played with her pet pit bull ‘Sugar’.

'It was unreasonable and reckless for the suspect to spend an estimated 15 minutes on Facebook and all the time playing with her pit bull 'Sugar' while the [child] was in the pool without any supervision,' the arrest warrant reads.

Almost two hours later an off-duty Dallas police officer, who also worked as a security guard at the apartment complex, told the group the pool was closed.

But when Thomas began to gather the children she couldn't find the 3-year-old Kanyce.

The affidavit states that when Thomas walked in the pool, she kicked the child’s lifeless body.

Thomas immediately gave the child to the off-duty officer, who began performing CPR while 911 was called. The child was taken to a local hospital but was pronounced dead.

Thomas faces up to 20 years in prison if indicted and convicted on the reckless injury charge. She is being held in Dallas County Jail on a $25,000 bond.

Her last Facebook post, from April, reads: 'Hey everybody Im back n ready to act a fool'.
