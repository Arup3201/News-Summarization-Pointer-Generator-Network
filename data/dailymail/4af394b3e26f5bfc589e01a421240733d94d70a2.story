Football clubs are always finding weird and wonderful ways to improve their players' performance in training, but Partick Thistle have stumbled on a particularly strange one.

Defender Jake Carroll, on loan from Huddersfield Town, was made to train in a onesie on Tuesday, ahead of the side's Scottish League cup clash with Celtic.

Carroll, 23, was being punished for being the 'worst trainer' in the squad, but the defender looked like he was enjoying himself in the unusual kit.

Alan Archibald's side, who are currently eighth in the Scottish Premiership, travel to Celtic Park on Wednesday for a Scottish League cup quarter-final tie.

The home side have not lost to Partick in over two decades, and will be confident of continuing their revival under Ronny Deila. 

The Scottish Champions have won their last three games and will be top of the Premiership if they win their game in hand.
