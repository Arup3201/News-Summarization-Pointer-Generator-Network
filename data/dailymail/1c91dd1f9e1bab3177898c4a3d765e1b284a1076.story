The body of the nurse who committed suicide after the royal hoax phone call arrived back in India yesterday.

As Jacintha Saldanha’s family made the journey home with her hessian-covered coffin for her funeral today, it emerged that she left a note for the two Australian radio DJs behind the prank, blaming them for her death.

The senior nurse is also said to have been involved in a long-running ‘personal disagreement’ with a junior colleague.

Mrs Saldanha, 46, was found hanged at
her nurses’ accommodation at the King Edward VII Hospital in London, 
where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning 
sickness.

One of three suicide notes suggests 
that even before the prank call, Mrs Saldanha was ‘unhappy’ that 
following a misdemeanour by a subordinate the hospital had decided not 
to discipline her colleague.

A family friend said: ‘Jacintha was involved in a personal disagreement with a colleague several weeks before the prank call.

'The hospital had decided not to take
any formal action but to put the two nurses on separate shifts. 
Jacintha made clear her disappointment and that she was not happy.

'She felt the hospital should have taken a tougher line. She was critical of that.’'

In the short letter she apparently 
singled out two individuals for blame. It also emerged that after she 
had unwittingly put DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian through to 
another nurse, one called back and told her they had played a prank 
which they were about to broadcast.

That is believed to have left her 
feeling confused and agitated. At a memorial service in Westminster 
Cathedral on Saturday, her husband Benedict Barboza said his wife’s 
death had left an ‘unfillable void’.

The couple’s son Junal, 17, and adopted daughter Lisha, 14, also paid tribute before travelling with her body to Mangalore.

Ms Saldanha's funeral will take place today at Our Lady of Health Church in Shirva, Karnataka, at 4pm local
time (10am GMT), said her family, who arrived at Bajpe Airport in 
Mangalore yesterday

Her coffin also arrived in India yesterday. It came after Ms Saldanha’s children described
the ‘unfillable void’ left in their lives by their mother's death as a 
mass was held at Westminster Cathedral on Saturday.

Following
the service in central London, Jacintha's husband, NHS accountant Ben Barboza, 49, and two 
children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14, paid an emotional tribute to a 
‘kind-hearted, generous and well-respected woman’.

Mr
Barboza said: ‘My wife, you were the light in my darkness, who always 
showed me the way forward. From the day we met, you always stood by me 
in times of hardship and happiness.

‘I feel a part of me has been ripped 
out,’ he added, fighting back tears. ‘Without your beautiful smile and 
sparkling personality, the house is an empty place to live.

Death: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanging in her nurses' quarters at King Edward VII Hospital

‘Nineteen years of togetherness with a
strong bond of affection and understanding will be cherished forever in
my life. Your loss is a very painful one and nobody can take that place
in my life ever again. I love you and miss you forever.’

Ms Saldanha's daughter Lisha, 14, 
said: ‘We will miss your laughter, the loving memories and the good 
times we had together. The house is an empty dwelling without your 
presence.

‘We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives.

'We
love you mum, sleep in peace and watch over us until me meet again in 
heaven. We will always love you and keep you close to our heart.’

Her son Junal said: ‘Our mother, kind hearted, generous and a well-respected woman in both of our lives. You were the core of the family who kept is together.

‘In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success. Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong which we appreciate.

‘You worked tirelessly to give us everything that we have today. When we achieved good grades and merit, your pat on our backs encouraged us more.’

Standing outside the cathedral alongside
their local MP Charlotte Leslie and MP Keith Vaz, who has been 
campaigning on behalf of the family, Mr Barboza said the family ‘could 
not have foreseen the unprecedented tragedy that has unfolded in our 
lives’.

'In times of difficulty you showed us the way forward to happiness and success. Your priority for us was a good education and a bright future. You taught us right from wrong'

‘The events of the last week have shattered our lives. We barely have the strength to withstand the grief and sorrow.’

He thanked the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prime Minister David Cameron for their condolences.

Memorial services have already been held at the hospital where Ms Saldanha worked and in Bristol where her husband and children live.

Indian-born Ms Saldanha left two notes in her room and also had marks on her wrist when her body was discovered, Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard on Thursday.

Saddened: The DJs behind the call - Mel Greig and Michael Christian - gave an emotional account of their reaction to Ms Saldanha's death in an interview on Australian TV last week

A provisional date of March 26 has been set for the next inquest hearing.

John Lofthouse, the King Edward VII's Hospital chief executive, has said the nurse was reassured on a number of occasions by senior management after the hoax.

The DJs behind the call - Mel Greig and Michael Christian - gave an emotional account of their reaction to Ms Saldanha's death.

Interviewed on Australian TV networks, the presenters said their prank call to the hospital prompted ‘a tragic turn of events no-one could have predicted or expected’.

Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of 2Day FM, ended the pair's Hot 30 show and suspended prank calls across the company.
