Nadine Williams outside Swansea Crown Court. The transvestite, formerly known Dean Williams, is on trial charged with rape

A transvestite showed his friend his collection of female women's outfits and shoes and gave her a tour of a sex dungeon before raping her, a court has heard.

Dean Williams, also known as Nadine, was looking after the house of cross-dressing dominatrix friend Nicky and asked her to go to the bedroom as he wanted to 'show off' his female clothing.

Swansea Crown Court was told that before the attack Wiliams, 38, had relied on his friend for support through his decision to cross-dress.

Prosecutor Huw Rees said: 'Williams met the woman not long after he had announced he was transgender and wanted to be known as Nadine.

'He wore women’s clothes that day and was very open about his cross-dressing.

'The woman said she would support him through this period of change.'

Williams, of Port Talbot, South Wales, denies rape and two charges of assault by penetration.

Mr Rees described how the victim agreed to go with Williams for drinks and a meal at the Big Can pub in Neath, south Wales.

Mr Rees added: 'They left the pub and went to the home of a friend of Nadine’s.

'Nadine had told her there was an S&M room there with cages, whips, chains and dominatrix apparatus on the walls in an upstairs bedroom they called The Dungeon.

'Nadine asked if she wanted to see the dungeon and his women’s clothes.

'They went into the room and Nadine suggested they try out some of the equipment but she declined.

'Nadine kissed her and she pushed him away and told him not to be so stupid. He offered to show her his clothes and they went into the next bedroom where he pushed her on the bed, straddled her and ripped off her top and bra.

'While he was doing this he was snarling and growling.

'She was trying to kick him off and she bit his shoulder.

'Her jeans and boots were removed by him and he raped her. “She said: “I told him: 'No, f*cking get off.'

The court heard he performed oral sex on her but she then managed to escape the bedroom and run downstairs with her top and jeans in her hand. 

Mr Rees described the attack, adding that Williams had forced his hands on her as she tried to re-dress, hurting her.

He said : 'She was crying and couldn’t understand why it was happening. She managed to get off the settee and ran out of the house.'

After her escape, the victim text  a friend: 'Help me. He just tried raping me. In a mess.'

She was later found by a friend sitting on stairs and in a hysterical state.

Williams was arrested at 5am and told police: 'She was here earlier on and we had sex together, but but was consensual.'

After being accused of rape, Williams said that because of his condition his genitalia had receded into his 
body-but the woman had pulled it back out so that they could have sex.

The jury was shown tapes of the woman’s interviews with police.

The woman, who is in her 30s, said: “Nadine was telling me about his cross dressing and I said I would support what he was doing.

'It was weird but I’d rather be a support to him than an enemy.'

She also described her shock at being shown the sex dungeon. She said: “He was telling me he was becoming an escort and that Nicky was being paid to be a dominatrix and he was trying to get into it.

'It was a bit freaky to be honest. I was trying to laugh it off, that’s when he went for me and tried to kiss me.

“He said I should get into it but I said no.'

The trial continues.
