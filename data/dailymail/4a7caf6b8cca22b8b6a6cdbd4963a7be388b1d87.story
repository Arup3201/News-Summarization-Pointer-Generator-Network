Children were hardly given the best lesson in political spin by MP Keith Vaz when he fell face first off a roundabout during a photocall.

The Labour MP tumbled into a sandpit while opening a new £40,000 play area yesterday in his constituency in Leicester.

But rather than being embarrassed by the
slip, he simply got back on - before falling off for a second time

The Labour MP for Leicester East was officially opening the £40,000 Rushey Fields Recreation Ground.

During a photo opportunity, he fell off the roundabout and into the sand while seemingly having a great time on the equipment, according to the Leicester Mercury.

He was being watched by members of the media, along with children from a nearby primary school, when he made the slip up.

Leicester Mercury photographer Matt Short was there to capture the moment as he also played on the slide and swings.

He said: 'He was like a big kid and he didn't seem to mind getting covered in sand.'

Mr Short said the MP even got back on to the roundabout, before falling off again.

Mr Vaz admitted he had 'enormous fun'. He singled out the roundabout describing it as 'fast', adding that you could sit on it.

He said: 'The problem was I fell off a couple of times because it was a bit too fast.

'I think it’s probably designed for people smaller than me.'
