A poltergeist that maliciously terrorised a home for four months by hurling stones and knives at the people who lived there has been described as one of the most spookiest supernatural occupations in Australia.

Tony Healy and Paul Cropper spent several days at the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory when the poltergeist was in full swing back in 1998. 

The pair have published details of the encounter in their new book Australian Poltergeist: The Stone-throwing Spook of Humpty Doo and Many Other Cases.

Andrew Agius found the word CAR made from small pebbles in the bathroom of the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory back in 1998. Words referred to their friend Troy Raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house

The book details 50 of Australia's poltergeist occupations dating back to 1845 - with Humpty Doo coming in at number two.

The ghostly encounters at the McMinns Drive property started in January 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor, tables, beds and heads. 

On the same night, residents Andrew and Kirsty Agius, Dave Clark, his partner Jill Summerville and their mate Doug Murphy noticed knives, small batteries, spanners, shards of broken glass and other objects being dropped or hurled across rooms.  

They called in two Catholic priests and one Greek Orthodox priest to try and exorcise it.

But all attempts failed and one priest even reported seeing a crucifix being hurled across the room. 

'Whatever these things are they can run rings around us. My guess is some of the cases involve spirits of recently deceased people,' Mr Healy told Daily Mail Australia.

The residents were soon subjected to sinister words and symbols being drawn on the walls and floor in marker pens, scrabble tiles and pebbles.

The first series of words that appeared in the house - 'FIRE', 'SKIN', 'CAR', 'HELP' and 'TROY' - referred to their friend Troy Raddatz who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house before the first sign of the poltergeist appeared. 

Over the next couple of days the poltergeist cranked up the level of vandalism, causing serious damage - a CD player was thrown to the floor and destroyed, windows and glass cabinet doors were smashed by ashtrays and other flying objects.

Healy and Cropper spent five days and nights at the property in April 1998.

'We don’t know of anyone who visited the house and left sceptical. The poltergeist was pretty obliging by turning it on,' Mr Healy said. 

Pebbles from the driveway would regularly shower from the ceiling without warning, while knives, small batteries, spanners, shards of broken glass and other objects would be hurled across rooms

This is a collection of the items the poltergeist regularly hurled across rooms, according to residents  

'I saw an object materialise in mid-air. I was chatting to a lady and she was sitting across a wooden table across from me. She was reading a newspaper article with both her hands in plain sight.

'There were other instances where knives, bullets… whizzed past our heads. Showering of stones also happened three times while we were there.

'The messages on the floor and walls had a malicious flavour to them, but the thing is if it really wanted to hurt me… it could have embedded the knife in my back rather than hurl it past.'

After four months, the poltergeist left as suddenly as it arrived and its departure is still unexplained.  

This corkscrew held by Andrew was also a regular favourite of the poltergeist

Tony Healy and Paul Cropper spent several days at the Humpty Doo home in the Northern Territory when the poltergeist was in full swing back in 1998 and have published their encounter in a new book

Since witnessing the events at Humpty Doo 17 years ago, the pair visited various other sites to interview people who have lived through similar experiences. 

In their book, the Healy and Cropper cover in detail 11 of the most remarkable episodes in Australia. 

Australian Poltergeist will be available in March. For more details, visit www.australianpoltergeist.com.
