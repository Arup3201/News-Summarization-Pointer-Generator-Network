A brother and sister have been diagnosed with the same life-threatening condition that affects only three in a million people in the UK.

Four-year-old Emma Whittaker was diagnosed first with Fanconi Anaemia, a blood disorder that can lead to bone marrow failure and cancer.

Her mother Rachelle Emberton hoped her son James, three, would prove a suitable bone marrow donor to help save her life.

But two months later she received the devastating news that he also had the same rare condition.

Ms Emberton had hoped that James would be a suitable bone marrow match for Emma, But two months later he too was diagnosed with the life-threatening condition

Luckily a donor match has been found should James need a transplant.

But Rachelle and her partner Malcolm Whittaker are still searching for a match for Emma, who will need a transplant in the next few years.

Ms Emberon, a businesswoman from Pitstone, Buckinghamshire, said: 'It was devastating when we found out James had FA too.

'The doctor was very honest with us and told us the average life expectancy was 30.

'I've explained to Emma that she has special blood and James just picks up anything his big sister says.

'They are typical children - little angels on their own, but when they are together they become little devils.

'Emma is four going on 14 and like any other young child loves her princesses and going to school. She is my little princess.

'All I want is to see my children grow up.

Hopeful: 'All I want is to see my children grow up,' says Ms Emberton

'We've searched the international database and cannot find a match for Emma. We desperately need more people to come forward.'

Emma, who was born with one kidney, was diagnosed with FA in November 2012 when her mother noticed she was bruising easily.

Ms Emberton said: 'If I wasn't a pushy mother then we would never have found out she had FA. We might never have known until she got really poorly.

'The condition is so rare I've had to explain it to doctors and give them the standards of care documents.'

Emma's blood white and blood cells and platelets count has stabilised but doctors have advised she will need a bone marrow transplant in the next few years.

James, who was also born with one kidney, was diagnosed with the same condition last month.

There
are fewer than 150 sufferers of FA in the UK - with an incident rate of
just three in one million - and research and detailed information about
the condition is patchy.

Ms Emberton and Mr Whittaker, 53, who are both FA carriers, are now urging people to join the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register.

While a bone marrow donor has been found for James, the family are still searching for a match for Emma, who will need a transplant in the next few years

James (above), who was born with one kidney, was diagnosed two months after his sister

The charity is dedicated to saving the lives of people with blood cancer who need a blood stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

There are currently over 450,000 
people on the register, but the charity can still only find a match for 
around half the people who come to them in need of a lifesaving 
transplant.

Ms Emberton said: 'Registering is really simple - people do not realise. All you have to do it spit in a pot and send it off and you are on the register.

'My mother is Iranian and the doctors think that there may be a match in the Iranian community so she is going into community centres to try and get the word out.'

Jeannie Dalgleish, from support charity Fanconi Hope who has a daughter with the condition, said it is unusual for more than one child in a family to have FA.

She said: 'Genetic counselling is available for parents who have had a child with FA, but the condition is normally not diagnosed until children are eight.

'Looking after one child with the condition is hard, so it is a very difficult position to be in to have two children with it.'
