We all like the occasional midnight snack, but Lesley Cusack claims to have midnight feasts of up to 2,500 calories every night – in her sleep.

Mrs Cusack, 55, insists her raids on the fridge are not merely a massive attack of the munchies, but are the result of a rare medical condition.

The mother-of-three said she only discovers what she has eaten overnight when she sifts through the leftovers and empty packets strewn around her house in the morning.

Lesley Cusack cooks even while she is asleep, but says her raids on the fridge are the result of a rare medical condition

The mother-of-three's nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder

Alarmingly, she even chops up food and tries to cook it on her gas hob while asleep.

But her nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder.

Because her nightly calorific intake is the recommended daily amount for a man, her weight ballooned to 16 and a half stone.

As a result, she eats just fruit and salads during the day and has joined a slimming club to keep her weight under control.

Her doctors have not been able to give an explanation, but Mrs Cusack believes she suffers from a syndrome called nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder (NSRED).

She said: ‘I had started to find bits of mess downstairs, but I didn’t realise it was me. It was a while before I worked it out, but when I did, I felt very embarrassed and guilty.

Lesley, 55, must eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables during the day because she unconsciously eats junk food in her sleep

The mother-of-three must reserve morning fry-ups for special occasions because she has been known to rustle up a cooked breakfast in her sleep

‘There were times when I felt extremely depressed through trying to hide it.’

Mrs Cusack, from Warrington, Cheshire, believes she has been suffering from NSRED for several years. But she has only just told her family and sought medical help.

She says she has broken some of her teeth and bruised herself by trying to cook and eat food in the dark while asleep.

The illness that strikes at night

She finally decided to seek help after realising she was going outside to raid the freezer in her shed.

‘I was terrified at the thought of leaving the door open or having an accident outside,’ she said. Using the cooker, kettle and sharp knives means it’s only a matter of time before something more serious happens.’

The divorcee, who lives alone, examines her kitchen every morning to find out what she’s eaten at night – much of it junk food.

She added: ‘I tend to find opened tins of things or packets and I’ve no idea whether I’ve eaten some of them cold or not.

‘I’ve found soup in pans, but also in bowls. It all can get rather messy. I’ve put alarms on my doors in the hope it will wake me up. I simply turn it off in my sleep. I’m trying to lose weight but it’s a constant battle. I can follow a diet to the letter but it goes to pot at night.

‘One weekend, I came down to find the cake slice covered in butter. I’d used it while making cheese sandwiches.

‘The worst things that I know I’ve eaten are emulsion paint, Vaseline, cough syrup, raw potatoes and soap powder. The night I ate paint was the only time I’ve ever woken up. I can still remember standing in the kitchen touching my mouth and being very confused.

‘My bedding and night clothes are constantly getting stained and need washing. I’m always finding a trail of food leading downstairs.

‘The disturbed nights, waking exhausted with stomach cramp, feeling sick and finding food in the bed has become almost normal.’

Dr Paul Reading, President of the British Sleep Society and a consultant neurologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, said such cases were rare but not unknown.

Lesley has been keeping a visual diary of her nocturnal habits. In this instance she has eaten an unusual combination of a satsuma, a banana, cherry tomatoes a Kit Kat and a Fudge bar

Hazard: From this photo you can see that Lesley has attempted to poach eggs, which would require using a cooker in her sleep

‘A proportion of adult sleep-walkers will eat and even cook during apparent sleep, often consuming foods they would not normally enjoy,’ he said. ‘Weight gain and guilt are common consequences.’

Mrs Cusack is now waiting to see a specialist who she hopes will confirm she has NSRED.

‘Living with something that no one sees but that affects my life so much is sometimes impossible to cope with,’ she said.

‘There have got to be more people struggling with this condition. I can’t be the only person.’

Holiday hell: Lesley's condition makes staying with friends difficult because she is frightened she will raid their kitchen too
