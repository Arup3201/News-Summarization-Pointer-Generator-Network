Jose Mourinho admits he is powerless to prevent Spain selecting Diego Costa in their squad for next month's Euro 2016 qualifiers as the problems over his injury mount up.

The Chelsea manager is picking and choosing the forward's matches carefully after he returned from the last international break with a hamstring injury.

Spain's squad for European Championship qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg will be named next week and Costa is a key part of their plans.

Jose Mourinho says he is powerless to prevent Spain calling up Diego Costa despite his hamstring concerns

Mourinho was speaking about Costa ahead of their Premier League clash against Aston Villa

Mourinho said: 'I'm nobody to make that decision. Everything is clear. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows he's in trouble for quite a long time. But I'm nobody.

'The moment a national team wants to select a Chelsea player, I'm nobody. It's their decision. They can call the players, play them, do what they want. It's completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesn't play a part.

'The medical departments do what they want. It's not our decision. We can communicate, send exams and reports, but it's their decision.

'After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.'

Costa has been named on the Chelsea bench in previous games to protect his hamstrings

Costa missed the midweek Capital One Cup tie against Bolton but will return to the starting line-up for tomorrow's clash with Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League.

His hamstring injury is so sensitive that he may be rested or on the substitutes' bench for the Champions League trip with Sporting on Tuesday.

Mourinho added: 'He plays tomorrow and starts the game without problems. The question is always the same: "Can he finish the game and be in conditions to play in Lisbon 48 hours later?" That I don't know.

'But, at this moment, because I don't think about Sporting or the Champions League, I think about Villa in the PL and he plays for sure. He's in good position to start.

'If he doesn't play against Sporting, I play Drogba or Remy. But this game is tomorrow, not Tuesday. It's another game, another story. I don't think about the Sporting game.

'I play tomorrow with the team I think is the best to win against Villa. After that, the consequences I will face. I have to organise a team to play against Sporting. Tomorrow I play with the team I think is the best to win.

'Everyone is working hard. He is the first to do that. He's working hard in his recovery, with the medical staff and the conditioning staff, trying to be ready for every game.

'Mentally, he's ready for every game. Physically he's not. Everyone is trying hard for him to be able to play every game.'
