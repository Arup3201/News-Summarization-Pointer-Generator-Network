A 22-year-old student died last night after being hit by two cabs on New York's Upper East Side.

Kelly Gordon of Brielle, New Jersey was crossing York avenue near 84th street in Manhattan with her older sister at 11:28 P.M. when a southbound cab hit her and threw her into the other lane where she was hit by a northbound cab.

A witness of the bloody scene overheard Gordon's sister and one male friend tell police that they were coming from the 7-11 convenience store and that they were jaywalking when the accident occurred.

Kelly Gordon, 22, was simply walking to her sister's home from a convenience store on Manhattan's Upper East Side when she jaywalked and was hit by two taxis going in opposite directions

Kelly, a senior at Boston College, had been staying with her sister in New York where she was looking for jobs.

'We
 ran over right after the accident. She looked horrible, there was blood
 coming from her nose, you could tell she wasn't going to make it,' said
 another male witness.

The New York Daily News reports that Gordon was transported to New-York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell, where she died of her injuries.

Both drivers stayed at the scene and neither of them have been charged.

Upper
 East Side locals told reporters that the way that the street is at an 
incline on E. 84th street and the way it drops at E. 85th makes it 
difficult for drivers to see pedestrians and for pedestrians to see 
traffic.

Police are currently investigating the accident.

In
 New York alone, a total of 172 pedestrians were killed in traffic last 
year. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to decrease the number of 
jaywalking accidents by installing more signs with traffic announcements
 and bullhorns that say 'Use Crosswalk.'

In
 addition, the mayor wants police to take a harder line against speeding
 and failing to yield to pedestrians. He also wants speed cameras 
installed at the most dangerous spots — an action that requires state 
approval. And traffic lights could change more quickly in places where 
pedestrians get impatient and just walk.
