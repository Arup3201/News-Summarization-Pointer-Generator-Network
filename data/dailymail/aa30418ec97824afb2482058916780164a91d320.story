A 27-year-old woman has been pulled alive from rubble 67 hours after the magnitude-7.2 earthquake devastated eastern Turkey.

The English language teacher, Gozde Bahar, was freed from the rubble with several injuries.

It was reported that her heart stopped at a field hospital, but doctors managed to resuscitate her.

Rescued: Gozde Bahar, 27, was pulled out of the wreckage of a building in Ercis this morning - 67 hours after the earthquake struck eastern Turkey

Race against time: Rescue workers battle to find survivors under the debris in Ercis, Turkey, after a powerful earthquake on Sunday. A 27-year-old woman was pulled out alive 67 hours after the quake this morning

Devastating: At least 459 people have so far been confirmed dead after the 7.2-magnitude earthquake hit eastern Turkey

The dramatic rescue follows that of an
18-year-old university student, Eyup Erdem, who was pulled from the 
wreckage of a collapsed multi-storey building earlier this morning.

Rescuers
are desperately working against clock to find survivors in the rubble, 
with powerful aftershocks still shaking the area.

At least 459 people are confirmed to have been killed in the quake, which struck on Sunday afternoon.

The student's father, Salih Erdem, said his son had moved to the town of Ercis last month to study mechanics at a university.

Eyup had been sharing an apartment with other students.

Health Ministry official Seraceddin Com said around 40 people were pulled out alive from collapsed buildings yesterday.

They included a two-week-old baby girl brought out half-naked, but alive, from the wreckage of an apartment building.

Azra, whose name means 'help' in Hebrew, survived despite the freezing conditions and her mother and grandmother were later rescued from the same building.

Television footage showed emergency workers applauding as they pulled the tiny baby from a hulk of crushed concrete and metal.

The baby was said to be in good health, but was flown along with her mother to a hospital in Ankara for checks.

Workers were unable to find the baby's father and there was no other signs of life in the shattered building.

Prisoners set fire to a jail in the earthquake-hit city of Van yesterday and gunshots were heard as inmates fought guards following aftershocks.

A soldier said the prisoners had attacked the guards with scissors and knives, two days after 200 people were reported to have escaped in the chaos after the quake.

Flames and white smoke were visible from the building after a 5.4-magnitude aftershock sparked rioting among panicked prisoners.

Soldiers were ferried to the prison compound in mini-buses as they tried to put down the unrest.

One said: 'These shameless people. They threw scissors. They have everything inside, knives, daggers, everything. There's a whole gang of them.'

Some 200 prisones are thought to have escaped after the quake collapsed a perimeter wall, but 50 returned after visiting relatives to check on their safety.

Desperate survivors fought over aid and blocked aid shipments to the disaster-hit region.

Turkey has said it will need prefabricated homes to house survivors during the winter and will accept international aid offers.

Israel has offered assistance despite a rift between the two countries over last year's raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla that killed nine Turkish activists.

Around 2,000 buildings collapsed and 1,350 people have been injured in the quake.

The fact the earthquake struck in the daytime, when many people were out, averted an even worse disaster.

Close to 500 aftershocks have rattled the area, with a temblor of 5.7 magnitude sparking panic in the streets.

Gerald Rockenshaub, disaster response 
manager at the World Health Organisation, said the first 48 to 72 hours 
are crucial for rescues and the chances of finding survivors decrease 
significantly after that.

People
can survive without food for a week or so, but having access to water 
is critical, especially for the elderly and infants, he said.

Turkey lies in one of the world's most active seismic zones and is crossed by numerous fault lines.

In 1999, two earthquakes with a magnitude of more than seven struck north-western Turkey, killing 18,000 people.

Istanbul,
the country's largest city home to more than 12 million people, lies in
north-western Turkey near a major fault line and experts say tens of 
thousands could be killed if a major earthquake struck there.

Quake prone: Turkey is particularly susceptible to seismic activity, with four tectonic plates within its borders. Sunday's quake occurred along the North Anatolian fault, which runs along the top of the country
