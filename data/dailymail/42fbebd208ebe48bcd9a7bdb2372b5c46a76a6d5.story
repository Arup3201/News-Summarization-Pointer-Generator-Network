Do you know how much your shopping basket essentials would have cost 25 years ago?

That's the question being put to shoppers in a new quiz showcasing how much the price of eggs, bread, milk and beer would have set you back in 1990. 

It's no secret that the prices of everyday essentials like potatoes and beer have shot up, but it’s still shocking to see exactly how much costs have risen over the past two decades.

The rise in prices of essential items such as bread, eggs and vegetables have risen in the last 25 years

Research conducted by financial firm Provident compares prices for food items, such as fish and chips, teabags and Mars Bars, over 25 years for its memory-lane quiz Back In The Day.

The 11 multiple-choice food-related questions include asking users to guess the price of a pint of milk, a loaf of bread and a pint of beer.

On its website, it says: 'There was a time when penny sweets were a penny and you didn't have to re-mortgage your house to take your family for a fun day out.

'Take a trip down memory lane with our nostalgic cost of living quiz.'

But how well will you fare? Here, FEMAIL features the 11 food-related questions to see how good your memory is. The answers are in the box below.
