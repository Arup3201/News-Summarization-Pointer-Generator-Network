New Culture Secretary Maria Miller will today call on television bosses to broadcast more women’s sport in the wake of the success of stars such as Jessica Ennis, Victoria Pendleton and Ellie Simmonds this summer.

In a letter to broadcasters, Mrs Miller says that female athletes serve as ‘incredibly powerful role models’ for women and young girls.

But she adds that outside of the Olympics and Paralympics women’s sport has been ‘woefully under-represented on television’. Mrs Miller is summoning executives at the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to discuss the issue with her.

She will urge them to broadcast less men’s football and devote more time to sports such as women’s cricket, football, rugby and netball which, she says, ‘end up buried pretty deep within the TV schedules, if shown at all’.

A source at the Culture Department said: ‘There is a real risk that, as we head towards winter, football will dominate again and the names of our female Olympic and Paralympic stars will fade.’

Studies have suggested that women’s sport accounts for as little as 2 per cent of televised sports coverage outside Olympic periods. 

The Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation recently found that 80 per cent of women and girls do not do enough sport. A study last year found that just 0.5 per cent of commercial sponsorship in sports goes on women’s events.

In her letter, Mrs Miller, who succeeded Jeremy Hunt as Culture Secretary in the recent Government reshuffle, says: ‘Across the Olympic and Paralympic Games, female athletes have had incredible success. 

‘British women have stood proudly atop the medal rostrum. 

‘The success of these athletes has been truly inspirational and now we must make sure we keep that momentum going.’
