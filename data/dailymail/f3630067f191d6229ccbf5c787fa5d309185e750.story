A frail pensioner died from pneumonia after being trapped under a cupboard in his home for four days, an inquest heard.

Stanley West's horrified neighbour Jane Craufurd found the 83-year-old in agony after the large piece of kitchen furniture fell on him.

Mr West had several days of beard growth on his face and had not taken his epilepsy pills for four days.

Mrs Craufurd, who had popped round to take Mr West a flask of hot water following a power cut, could only see his hand protruding from beneath the bottom of the cupboard, which was blocking the kitchen doorway.

She rang the emergency services before reaching through a tiny gap to hold the dying pensioner’s hand as he whimpered in agony.

Police and emergency crews arrived at the house on Pamber End, Hampshire, and hauled the heavy cupboard off Mr West before rushing him to hospital.

He died the following day in Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital from pneumonia and hypothermia despite medics' efforts.

Mrs Craufurd told the inquest at Alton Magistrates’ Court, that she returned from a holiday in France on August 19, and went to see Mr West on August 21.

She said: 'I had a back door key but wouldn’t need to use it because he left the door unlocked. I always knocked on the door but wouldn’t expect a reply and would go straight in.

'I saw the kitchen cupboard was on the floor, could see a small part of his arm and could hear him groaning.'

PC Ian Wonnacott, from Basingstoke police station, was called to the incident at 10.40am.

He said: 'He was lying on his back with a large piece of furniture on him.

'He was conscious and breathing, although it was hard to understand what he was saying.'

Mr West’s brother, David West, also from Basingstoke, told the inquest that he saw the tragic pensioner only occasionally, but the 20-year age gap between them meant they were never close.

Speaking about the cupboard, he said: 'If he [Stanley] had fallen and leant on it, the weight would have made it fall.'

David told the inquest his brother had spent some time at a care home in 2010, following a collapse, but lived on his own in the neighbourhood where he had spent his entire life.

North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley described the circumstances of Mr West’s death as 'a very sad matter.'

He recorded a verdict of accidental death, adding: 'He had been trapped for four days by a cupboard that had fallen.'

Friends and neighbours today paid tribute to Mr West as a 'lovely' but 'private' man.

Mr West, who was known to friends as Joe was born and lived his entire life in the large detached house where he was found.

He was a Labourer at the Atomic Weapons Establishment, in Aldermaston, Berkshire, until he retired.

Mr West never married but had a 'lady friend' who lived in Southampton.

Neighbour Derek Joseph, 74, said: 'He was a lovely man and what happened was such a tragedy.

'But he was quite private and quite reclusive - he kept him self to himself.

'He loved his Independence and would never have moved into any sort of care home. Joe liked to do things his way.'

He added: 'Joe lived in a big house with a very large garden it must be at least over half an acre.

'What happened was just very sad and very unlucky way to go.'
