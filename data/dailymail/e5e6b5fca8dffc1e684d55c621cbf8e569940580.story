French black truffles can sell for £200 per lb, but chefs in France have been accused of using Chinese truffles in their place, which sell for just £12 per lb

They are notoriously difficult to grow, even more difficult to dig up, and at £200 per lb, they are one of the most expensive foods in the world.

French black truffles, also known as 'black diamonds', are so in-demand that even celebrity chefs have to use them sparingly.

So it should come as no surprise to learn that unscrupulous eateries are conning consumers by spraying cheap Chinese varieties with chemicals then passing them off as the real deal.

Asian truffles, which are lighter and much more common than their French equivalent, can cost as little as £12 per lb.

Because truffles are now so rare and are added to dishes in such tiny amounts it makes the practice easy to get away with, complain trufficulteurs - as the food's connoisseurs are known.

The French Federation of Trufficulteurs (FTT) is calling for better education on truffle varieties and new legislation on labelling to stop customers being ripped off.

An investigation by a French consumer watchdog in 2012 found that between ten and 15 per cent of truffles claiming to be of the exclusive Peringord variety were actually cheap imports.

Peringord truffles are the second most expensive in the world, after the Italian Alba variety which can fetch £2,300 per lb.

The French fungus, which grows around the roots of oak, hazel and lime trees, used to be more common, but as farmers deserted the countryside for cities and two world wars destroyed the fungi's natural habitat, they became scarce.

Truffles are difficult to grow and even trickier to find - usually requiring trained sniffer dogs or pigs

Throughout France the few truffle farms that still exist produce just 50 tonnes of them annually, with roughly another 25 tonnes imported from China.

The FTT is now introducing a programme to help the 20,000 French truffle-growers increase production by handing over around £200,000 annually to increase production.

Growers themselves have agreed to plant roughly 300,000 to 400,000 trees every year that the fungi are known to grow around, though it can take up to ten years for the new wooded areas to produce the delicacy.

Truffles may be expensive but they are by no means the most expensive food in the world.

Prized beluga caviar, made from the eggs of the beluga sturgeon, sells for around £5,000 per lb, and is so valuable that the fish are periodically given ultrasound scans to check how the eggs are doing.

Spanish saffron, made from the stoma of crocus flowers, sells for around the same amount. It is pricey because it takes a patch of crocuses roughly the size of a football pitch to produce one lb which must all be picked by hand.
