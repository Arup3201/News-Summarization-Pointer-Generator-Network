Chelsea's midfield enforcer Nemanja Matic believes Jose Mourinho’s team can win an unprecedented four trophies this season.

The Serbia international was on top form as Chelsea brushed aside Stoke to win 2-0 at the Britannia Stadium and stay top of the Barclays Premier League on Monday night. 

And afterwards Matic refused to discount a four-trophy haul of the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup this season.

He said: 'I think it’s possible, we have a chance so it’s possible. I don’t want to say that we’re going to win it but we’re going to try.

'We have quality but also other teams are strong, they have quality also but we will try and we will see if we can do.

'But I am confident, I believe in my team, my team-mates, so everything is possible.'

Chelsea face West Ham on Boxing Day with their London neighbours surprisingly placed in the top four themselves.

The Blues remain top of the table and are the favourites to claim this season's Premier League title 

Last season Sam Allardyce’s team were criticised for a defensive approach when they faced Chelsea.

Matic added: 'I saw them a couple of games this season and I think that they are very strong, they play very well.

'We expect a tough game, we know what we have to do, we know that we play for Chelsea and especially at home we have to take three points.

'I think that the opponent plays how you let him play, so we have to be focused on our game, and if we are ready for everything and if we play like I know we can play, I’m not scared of anybody.'
