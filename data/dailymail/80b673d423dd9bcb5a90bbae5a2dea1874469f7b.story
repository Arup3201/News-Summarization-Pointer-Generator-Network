The son of a snake-handling Kentucky preacher who died from a snakebite says he's recovering from his own rattlesnake wound.

Cody Coots told the Lexington Herald-Leader he was bitten on a finger by a 6-foot rattlesnake as he removed snakes from a cage on Monday.

'All I could think about â€” am I going to make it?' Coots said.

The 21-year Coots said he declined medical treatment from an ambulance crew. Instead, he said he relied on prayer for healing.

'I told the Lord that I wouldn't go to the hospital,' Coots said.

He said his hand swelled and he vomited repeatedly, but by Tuesday the pain was gone.

'For a rattler bite, it wasn't bad at all,' Coots said.

Coots is a fourth-generation snake handler and had been bitten five times previously.

He told the paper that he will continue to handle snakes.

'If the Lord moves, we'll handle'm,' he told the Herald-leader. 'It's the word of the Lord.'

His father, Jamie Coots, died of a snakebite in February. Following his death, Cody Coots took over as pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name church in Middlesboro, Kentucky.

Speaking to TMZ in February, Cody Coots said 'It was God saying, this is how you wanted it, and it's your time to go ... If he didn't plan [to die this way] he would have stayed alive.'

Both father and son were featured last year in National Geographic's Snake Salvation, the Herald-Leader points out.
