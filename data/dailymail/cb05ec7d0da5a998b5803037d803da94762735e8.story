The family of a young mother left unable to eat, drink, speak or walk after falling from her horse when thugs pelted it with stones have spoken of their heartbreak at her plight.

Mother-of-two Lindsey Broomhead, 29, has been in hospital for eight months after suffering severe brain damage when she was thrown off horse Murphy while riding in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

Surgeons had to remove part of the cerebellum, the region of the brain which controls motor skills, meaning she cannot walk, and she also suffered a stroke, meaning she cannot swallow.

Ms Broomhead was riding Gypsy Cobb cross Murphy in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, when a group of teenage thugs pelted the horse with stones, causing it to throw Ms Broomhead off and bolt

But despite these terrible injuries, Lindsey's mother Val says she is still able to hug her children, daughter Kayden, nine, and son Corey, five, which has kept her spirits up.

She added: 'Lindsey is making small steps, but she will never be able to have physical involvement with her kids again.

'Even if they go on holiday she will be unable to play on the beach or chase them about. She will have to sit aside and watch instead without joining in. 

'All this has been taken away from her because of a needless, senseless prank. It really is devastating for all of us and our lives have changed so much. 

'Luckily the children are little wonders and have been very good adjusting to the situation. Lindsey can give the kids a cuddle, which is comforting to them. But she can’t eat or drink without a tube.

'The only way she can communicate with us is through typing on an iPad or alphabet board. It was strange getting used to it at first but it’s been eight months now and life goes on. 

'We’re all adjusting to it but it is so sad to see her like this.'

Val, 59, who with husband Frank, 62, now has legal guardianship of Kayden and Corey, also spoke about the emotional impact the fall has had on the family.

She added: 'We’re very lucky to have a great family and this has brought us closer together. 

'Most days you feel positive - Lindsey is an amazing woman and her spirit is so uplifting - other days you want to break down and cry buckets it’s so sad.

'We go and visit her in hospital everyday - sometimes twice a day - just to keep her spirits up.

'On Christmas Day we all got together in hospital to be with her for a few hours. It was strange but some things are more important - we just all pulled together.

'The school have also been very helpful in making sure the kids are okay. Everyone has been supportive.'

Police are still looking for the attackers, who threw rocks at Murphy as Ms Broomhead rode him along this track in Rotherham, causing him to bolt and leaving Ms Broomhead for dead

Val said Lindsey and her family now want justice and for Murphy’s senseless attackers to be found.

She said: 'Murphy now let’s people ride him again but Lindsey will never get on a horse for the rest of her life. It won’t change what has happened to all our lives, we want them to see justice.

'The police have been brilliant and so helpful, but these people are still out there and know what they did. This has devastated us and I wish they could see the effect their dreadful prank has had.'
