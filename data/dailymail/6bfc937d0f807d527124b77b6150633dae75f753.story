An American comedian appearing on BBC
Breakfast found himself lost in translation today after using the word 'w****r' while discussing a Stateside remake of Only Fools And Horses.

Presenters Bill
Turnbull and Sian Williams had asked funnyman Dave Fulton how he would pronounce one of Del Boy's favourite sayings 'lovely jubbly' in an American accent.

Fulton replied: 'You wouldn't, because it's like me saying w****r'.

Moments earlier, presenters Bill Turnbull and Sian Williams (right) had asked Fulton how he would pronounce one of Del Boy's favourite sayings 'lovely jubbly' in an American accent

Fulton replied: 'You wouldn't, because it's like me saying w****r'

While the W-word is offensive in the UK, its derogatory connotation is generally unknown in the States.

American dictionary Merriam-Webster defines 'w****r' as 'chiefly British, usually vulgar'.  

To U.S. ears, the word just means 'a stupid person'.

Such is 
the mild nature of the swear-word in the U.S. that it even appeared in a
1998 episode of The Simpsons ('Trash Of The Titans'), where it is 
uttered by  U2 bass player Adam Clayton and Mr Burns.

In 2008, the episode aired twice before the watershed on Channel 4 uncensored and received 31 complaints.

Amid shrieks of astonishment, the presenters immediately apologised to viewers.

Mr Fulton, clearly taken aback, also said sorry - unaware of the offence he had caused.

Fellow guest, comedian Mitch Benn, could not help
laughing and struggled to compose himself.

Mr Fulton, who is described on Comedy
Central as 'looking like the underfed brother of Billy Connolly', is well known
for his wry observations of British life.

He has lived and worked in the UK for many years and has often performed at the Edinburgh Festival.

But he had overlooked one of the most
infamous swear words in the country.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, a guest used a swearword live on-air this morning.

'Both Sian and Bill apologised immediately and again at the end of the interview.
We are sorry for any offence caused.'

Meanwhile, Twitter users have been congratulating Mr Fulton by
saying he 'just made my morning'.

Ryandoc117 tweeted: 'Dave Fulton saying
'w****r' on bbc breakfast did a better job of waking me up than my coffee
haha.'

Lfparker2 said: 'Funny to see comedian
Dave Fulton slip up on bbc breakfast and use the word.'

And MrPaddyDoherty said: 'If you just
heard American comedian Dave Fulton saying 'W****R' on BBC breakfast news just
made my morning ................!!!!!!'

Look out, America, the Trotters are coming

Del Boy rarely made it past Peckham in his yellow Reliant Robin.

But the Trotters could finally be taking their brand of market trading global, with a deal that is set to conquer America.

Senior
U.S. TV executives have commissioned a pilot episode of the much-loved 
British sitcom, which starred David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhust.

Del Boy, left, Rodney, centre, and Granddad, right, could feature in a U.S. version of Only Fools And Horses being planned by TV executives

The show could see U.S. versions of Del 
Boy, Rodney and Uncle Albert using expressions such as 'tool' instead of
plonker and 'awesome' instead of lovely jubbly.

And the loveable rogues are more likely to live in an apartment than a block of high-rise council flats.

Writers
Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley, the team behind hit shows Happy 
Endings and Scrubs are understood to be working on a pilot.

Characters: Steve Carell, left, from the U.S. version of The Office could play Del Boy while Jason Biggs could portray Rodney

The show will centre on the the 
'misadventures of two streetwise brothers and their ageing grandfather as
they concoct outrageous, morally questionable get-rich-quick schemes in
a bid to become millionaires', according to the Independent.

The sitcom was an enormous success in
Britain, where it was broadcast on BBC1 between 1981 and 1991. 
Highly-anticipated Christmas specials were also shown until 2003, when 
Del Boy finally made his millions by selling an antique watch.

Plonker - tool

Lovely jubbly - awesome

Dipstick - schmuck

Wally - dope 

Geezer - dude

Bird - babe

Perfect - ace

Terrific - neat 

Easy money - pure gravy

Pound - buck

Boozer - joint

Cushty - all good

Pukka - primo

One
iconic scene showed Del Boy and Rodney dress up as Batman and Robin, 
before turning up at a wake they thought was a fancy dress party.

But the unique brand of British humour may not prove as popular with a U.S. audience familiar with a different style of comedy.

Previous attempts to repackage popular shows such as Dad's Army and Are You Being Served for a U.S. audience failed.

Even
The Office written by Ricky Gervais initially received a lukewarm 
reaction from baffled audiences before it became a success.

One
of the few other shows to have become a success in the U.S.  was 
Steptoe And Son, which was remade as Stamford And Son and ran between 
1972 and 1977.

Steve Carell, who played Ricky 
Gervais' character in The Office, has said it would be a 'dream role' to
star in a U.S. version of Only Fools And Horses.

'The British do sitcoms better than 
anybody else in the world. I think with the right scriptwriters and cast
we could do Only Fools And Horses justice. If anybody wants to help me 
do a remake I'd love it,' said Carell.

There
have also been suggestions that Jason Biggs, who played Jim in American
Pie, could star as Rodney. While Robin Williams might play Uncle 
Albert.

This most likely 
setting for the show would be among the hustle and bustle of New York - a
city that is no stranger to wheelers and dealers such as Del Boy 
looking to make a living.
