Downsizing: Ivana Trump has sold her Palm Beach home for $18 million

Ivana Trump sold her Palm Beach mansion for $18 million dollars - more than four times what she paid for the beachfront home 20 years ago.

The 14,406sq ft 'Concha Marina' is being purchased by an as-yet unidentified buyer for $900,000 below asking price, Gossip Extra reports.

For that princely sum, they will get a residence that boasts a private underground tunnel to the beach, nine bedrooms, and 13 bathrooms.

There is also a separate apartment built over the home's four-car garage.

Ms
 Trump, 65, says that she is vacating the home, her primary 
residence for the last 20 years, because her three children have grow up
 and she feels that it is time to downsize, Top Real Estate Deals reports.

In fact the oldest of Ms Trump's children - Donald Trump Jr - turned 36 in December.

He is followed by sister Ivanka, 32, and Eric, age 30.

Ms
 Trump originally bought her Palm Beach property in 1994 for $4.4 
million – two years after her divorce from Donald Trump - whose 
Mar-a-Lago club is just half a mile down the road.

Massive size: The home is 14,406 square feet and comes with nine bedrooms and 13 bathrooms

But
 it does not seem that Ms Trump would have had any need to venture to 
the resort, as her own home boasts a decorative lotus-shaped swimming 
pool in the courtyard.

The 
house's charm comes courtesy of its designer - the famous 1920s Palm 
Beach architect Addison Mizner, whose career hallmarks are felt 
throughout the home.

Living quarters: The residence was designed by famous 1920s Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner, who was known for his Spanish-Moorish style

Built-in features The home comes equipped with an underground tunnel that leads out to the beach, as well as countless airy rooms that take advantage of Florida's warm climate

The American designer made a name for 
himself among the early Palm Beach set with his Spanish-Moorish home 
designs that accommodated Florida’s hot, humid weather.

Mr Mizner's airy homes emphasized cross-ventilation by keeping its kitchen in wings far away from their living quarters.

It is unknown where Ms Trump plans to reside once the home is sold.
