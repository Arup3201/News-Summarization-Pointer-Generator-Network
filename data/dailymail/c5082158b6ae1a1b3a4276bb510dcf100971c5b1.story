Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has insisted that World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo does not need a rest, and will play him against Elche on Tuesday night.

Ancelotti, speaking to the media at a pre-match press-conference on Monday, was asked if his star forward could do with a break.

'No, for now Ronaldo does not need a rest. He's in great shape, in good condition, mentally focused.

'We need him even more when he's on top form.'

Apart from one match, Madrid's loss against Real Sociedad, Ronaldo has played every minute of every match this season, scoring eight goals in the process.

Madrid faced Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday, where Ronaldo grabbed a hat-trick to help his team romp to an 8-2 win.

Ancelotti also spoke about his positioning: 'Where he plays is circumstantial. I think that Cristiano has to be given freedom to do what his instinct tells him on the pitch.

'If he has to move over to the right, he does. Interchanging positions between the forwards is a good thing, because it adds unpredictability to our attacking play.'
