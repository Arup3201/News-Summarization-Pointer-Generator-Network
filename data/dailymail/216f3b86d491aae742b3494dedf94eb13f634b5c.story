Petrol retailers have been urged to cut prices at the pumps immediately after a fall in wholesale costs of up to 6p a litre

Petrol retailers have been urged to cut prices at the pumps immediately after a fall in wholesale costs of up to 6p a litre.

The RAC said the price suppliers pay for fuel had dropped since the end of August as a result of a strong pound and positive developments in Syria.

Filling stations and supermarkets should ‘play fair’ and share the price drop with Britain’s 35million drivers, the motoring organisation said.

It has calculated retailers could reduce the price of unleaded petrol by 6p and diesel by 2p a litre.

Unleaded costs an average of 138.01p a litre and diesel 142.75p after a slight increase, according to figures from the industry analysts Experian Catalist. 

Asda has already reacted to the drop in wholesale costs by cutting the price of unleaded by 2p to 133.9p and diesel by a penny to 138.9p a litre.

The RAC said retailers had scope to go further.

Oil prices have fallen since Syria agreed to sign an international treaty banning chemical weapons. The pound has also reached a seven-month high against the US dollar, the currency in which oil is traded on international markets.

The RAC said that as a result of these developments it was ‘calling on fuel retailers to pass on the reductions to cash-strapped motorists immediately’. 

Its rival the AA has said a key issue affecting motorists at the pumps is the disparity in petrol prices between areas.

The association’s president, Edmund King, said: ‘Last weekend, supermarket petrol in some towns was 5p a litre more expensive than supermarket petrol in another town just down the road.

‘The pump price postcode lottery is a persistent menace.’
