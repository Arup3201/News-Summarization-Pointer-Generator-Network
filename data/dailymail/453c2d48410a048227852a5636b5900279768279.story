It is a tradition which began more than 200 years ago, when George III was on the throne and Britain was at war with France.

But living on Spurn Point is no longer possible for the families of the brave lifeboatmen who have helped stricken sailors in and around the Humber Estuary.

Life on this remote peninsula in East Yorkshire, buffeted by winds and tides, has become so isolated that the families of Britain's only full-time lifeboat crew will leave their homes and move inland later this year.

End of an era: Humber lifeboat coxswain David Steenvoorden and his wife Karen are preparting to leave their home on Spurn Point, where families of lifeboatmen have lived for more than 200 years

Out on a limb: Spurn Point, which has been home to lifeboatmen and their families since the early 19th century, is a 20,000ft spit of land at the mouth of the Humber Estuary

Remote: Families living on the peninsula have become increasingly isolated as it has been buffeted by winds and tides and affected by erosion

The lifeboat crew will then begin a new shift system with five members working six days on and six days off.

Families have lived in houses on the remote 20,000ft spit of land since the early 19th century.

The lifeboat station was founded in 1810. It now keeps one of the busiest of the RNLI's all-weather vessels, dealing with more than 50 incidents a year.

Moving on: Karen Steenvoorden, pictured with husband David, said the lifeboatmen's wives had taken the decision to leave 'really hard'

But increased erosion has caused the road leading to the peninsula's tip to become impassable at times as the wind blows sand across.

High tides frequently make it impossible for children to get to school and two families had to stay in a hotel last year when a sea surge cut off the road.

The lifeboat crew must be available 
for call-out 24 hours a day, which makes life difficult for spouses who 
must plan ahead for even the simplest of tasks.

The nearest shop is a 16-mile round trip from their homes.

lifeboat coxswain Dave Steenvoorden, 54, said: 'I am going to be gutted
when I leave. I think they have made the absolutely right decision to 
move the families but I have been here 21 years and love it.'

His wife Karen said: 'The wives have taken it really hard. If you could bottle what Spurn is and sell it you’d be a millionaire.

'It’s very laid back. We don’t lock doors. We are going to find it so strange going out into the big wide world.'

Six families are on the move, and the last is due to leave Spurn Point on August 20.

Their homes will be converted into dormitories and offices.

Andy Clift, the RNLI's divisional inspector, said the station was so remote that it was difficult to staff with volunteers.

The lifeboat will remain with a fully professional crew and the RNLI has recruited four new members to work the shift system.

An RNLI spokesman said: 'Our crew 
make many sacrifices to enable them to save lives at sea - a role they 
would be unable to carry out without the full support of their families -
and the RNLI has a duty of care to both its crew members and to the 
families.

'Gutted': Dave Steenvoorden said he would find it hard to leave his home on the peninsula

History: A lifeboat station has stood on Spurn Point since 1810. The site is currently home to one of the RNLI's busiest all-weather lifeboats

Changes: The lifeboat crew will begin a new shift system with members working six days on and six days off

The way they were: The 1900 lifeboat crew, pictured with their vessel at Spurn Point

Past residents: Former members of the lifeboat crew at Spurn Point

Tradition: Lifeboat crews have been operating from Spurn Point since 1810

'We want to ensure our crew members have a satisfactory work-life balance, with appropriate time off from operational duty and their place of work.

'The current way of working means this is impossible to achieve.

'It has also become increasingly clear that the continuous erosion of Spurn Point and regular breaching of the road will make it difficult to sustain community life for much longer.

'Travel for the crew members' families to and from work, school, the shops et cetera can be difficult and sometimes dangerous.

'As the RNLI can no longer guarantee the safety and comfort of the families living on the Point, it has become imperative that we progress plans to move them away from the lifeboat station.'

Place by the sea: Families have lived in a cluster of homes on the peninsula for more than two centuries, but the current residents have been beset with difficulties caused by winds and tides

Nostalgic: The decision to move the families inland brings to an end more than 200 years of tradition
