Angry: John Kirby, pictured with his daughter Amelia, is demanding answers over the mysterious death of his pet dog Wilma

First it was the muffled crack of a gunshot and then the six ‘yelps’ that told the dog owner something was terribly wrong.

Now property developer John Kirby is demanding answers from a luxury hotel after his beloved whippet was mistaken for a rabbit and shot dead on its golf course.

Four-year-old Wilma was killed just yards from her owner’s garden.

Mr Kirby, whose £400,000 house borders the Marriott Meon Valley Hotel and Country Club near Winchester, Hampshire, heard a ‘muffled crack’ before his pet ‘whimpered in pain’ and died.

The hotel chain has suspended pest control at all its British resorts.

The 45-year-old property developer, whose three-year-old grandson Alfie often plays in his garden, said he regularly sees gun-toting officials looking for rabbits in the dark on the golf course - apparently to stop them digging up the greens.

He said: ‘I see pest controllers out on the golf course about once a month, on a buggy, and using lamps to look for rabbits.

'I also hear the occasional gun shot. However, on this occasion, I had no idea anybody was there until I heard the crack of a gunshot, followed by Wilma yelping and whimpering in pain.’

Mr Kirby, a divorcee and father to Amelia, 21 and Buddy, 22, had returned from walking Wilma when the devastating incident happened at around 9.15pm.

He said: ‘We had returned from our walk, I sat in front of the TV with the patio doors open, and the dogs were wandering in and out.’

Wilma and his other dog Buffy, a 14-year-old Bedlington cross whippet, were in the garden, which is separated by bushes and shrubs from the 14th green and 15th tee of the 18-hole golf course.

Then he heard a ‘muffled crack’.

He said: ‘I knew instantly what it was and I shouted out “Wilma, Wilma” but only Buffy came back. All I could hear was six yelps.’

Mr Kirby eventually found Wilma’s lifeless body, which had a gunshot wound and was covered in blood.

He added: ‘She was lying dead and covered in blood beside a ditch - just a few metres from where I had been sitting.

‘A bullet had passed straight through her chest. The sight was sickening, and heartbreaking.’

He added: ‘I want to speak to the person who did it and just ask “why”? How could you mistake it for something else?

‘She was just a whippet and a really nice dog that was like a member of the family.’

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said officers have spoken to a man in connection to the incident, but made no arrests.

A
 hotel spokesman said: ‘Meon Valley, a Marriott Hotel and Country Club, 
is sad to confirm that an incident involving a pest controller and a 
local pet dog was reported to the police during the night.

‘A full police investigation is under way and we have suspended all pest control at our UK hotels until this is complete.

‘We
 are deeply sorry for the distress this unprecedented incident has 
caused the dog’s owners and we will do all we can to assist the police 
investigations.’

Meon Valley is a four-star hotel set in 225 wooded acres of rolling countryside on the edge of the South Downs.

As
 well as the 71-par 18-hole golf course, the £150-a-night hotel also 
boasts a PGA-rated nine-hole course and a golf academy with a covered 
driving range. There is also a heated indoor pool, fitness centre, 
tennis courts and health spa.

Demanding answers: Mr Kirby ,with his other dog Buffy, wants to know how pest control could mistake a whippet dog for something else

Mr Kirby, who has lived in the house for 40 years, said he had owned Wilma since she was an eight-week-old puppy.

He said: ‘Wilma was the kindest, friendliest, most loyal pet you could imagine. She meant the world to me, my children, and grandson.

‘Returning from work I’d pull on to the driveway and see her head peering out of an upstairs window.

‘Her eyes would light up, and she’d come dashing down the stairs to welcome me in as I got to the front door.’

He said the golf club had complained about dogs running across the golf course a couple of years ago - but it was not aimed directly at him.

The shooting happened at 9.15pm when it was ‘pitch black outside’ and nobody was playing on the course.

He added: ‘I know the dogs should not be on the golf course and I am careful to keep an eye on them when they are in the garden.

‘They are often just messing around in the hedge on the border between our garden and the course.

‘As soon as I lose sight of them, I call them back. They are well-trained and not unruly.’
