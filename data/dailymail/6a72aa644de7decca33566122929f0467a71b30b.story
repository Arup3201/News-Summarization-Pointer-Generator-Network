A Maine ski resort where seven people were injured over the weekend after a ski lift suddenly moved backwards has said a malfunctioning gearbox and backup brake system were to blame. 

Three people were taken to hospital after the King Pine lift, carrying around 230 people, began operating in reverse at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort in Carrabassett Valley on Saturday morning and riders began jumping off. None of the injuries are life-threatening.

On Sunday, the resort said a preliminary investigation found that a gearbox on the lift malfunctioned and disabled two brake systems, while a third backup brake also failed to deploy properly.

A lift attendant pulled an emergency brake to stop it after chairs slid back about 450 feet, Sugarloaf spokesman Ethan Austin said in a statement.

Wounded: Seven people (some of whom are pictured above) were injured after a chair lift at a Maine ski resort malfunctioned and started traveling down the mountain backward on Saturday

The lift had passed its annual state inspection and a dynamic load test that's required every seven years last fall, Austin said, while the gearbox passed a routine procedure that identifies potential problems on Friday.

The resort said the investigation is ongoing and the lift remains closed.

Riders who were still on-board when the lift eventually stopped were evacuated. 

Two of the three injured skiers transported to a hospital 40 miles have since been treated and released, while the third was transported to another hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said.

The condition of the third skier was not known, but the resort said the injuries were not believed to be life threatening.  

On Saturday afternoon, David Segre, who was standing in the crowded lift line, described the terrifying moment the machine started traveling backward, picking up speed by the second.

'It was really scary. It was like a gear had let loose and it was slowly picking up speed going the wrong way. So all the chairs... they were slipping backward,' said the 42-year-old skier.

'And as gravity works they started to go faster and faster and people were jumping off at the lower levels,' he added, estimating that the lift traveled backward for up to 300 yards before stopping.

Susan Haws Clifford, who was on the lift with her daughter, told WMTW News 8 that it 'started heading backwards really fast', adding: 'We were able to unbind our skis and jump off uninjured.'

But while some skiers close to the ground leaped off the lift, one man who was not able to ended up going around the loading area and heading up the mountain on the other side, Segre said.

It is unclear whether the injured riders jumped off the lift, or fell off due to its erratic movements.

The seven were treated by ski patrol and taken off the mountain for treatment by an emergency medical responder, Austin said. Three of the riders were later transferred to a nearby hospital.

Segre told AP it looked like three or four people were being tended to in the loading area of the lift, adding: 'I think everybody was being very careful not to move them until ski patrol arrived.'

On Saturday afternoon, photos and videos emerged on social media showing terrified riders, who were stranded meters high up in the air, being evacuated from the malfunctioning lift via ropes.

Officials have said the cause of the accident is under investigation. The chairlift, which can transport 2,100 skiers an hour on 122 chairs, receives routine daily inspections for safety, Austin said. 

It remains closed in the wake of the incident, according to ABC 9.

Sugarloaf was the site of another chairlift accident in 2010 in which a 35-year-old lift derailed, causing five chairs to fall to the ground, injuring eight skiers. That lift was replaced in 2011

One of the passengers injured in the 2010 accident, Rick Tonge, said this latest incident highlighted the need for the lifts to be looked at more closely.

'It's got to bring it to people's attention that something's got to be done,' Tonge said. 'This is an old mountain. It's been around a long time.'

He added that he worries that the resort has been slow to upgrade aging equipment.

'They have plans in the works to replace lifts. There have been plans right along. But they're late,' he said.  

The latest incident comes just days before the U.S. Alpine Championships are scheduled to take place at the world-famous ski resort. It will be the fifth time Sugarloaf has hosted the event.
