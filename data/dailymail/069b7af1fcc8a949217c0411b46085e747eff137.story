Coca-Cola plans to unveil a classic beverage nationwide this December that is a far cry from the sugary soda that made the brand famous.

As Americans cut down on unhealthy soft drinks, Coca-Cola has turned to creating a premium type of milk to boost their dwindling profits.

Fairlife will be available in stores in late December and boasts 50 per cent more protein and 50 per cent less sugar than regular milk. It also contains 30 per cent more calcium. 

The added nutritional benefits fatten the price tag and it will cost about double the amount of regular milk.

New product: As less and less Americans are buying the sugary soda that Coca-Cola is famous for, the brand has decided to come out with a premium milk product called Fairlife

Coming soon: Fairlife milk will be on shelves starting in late December and will cost twice the price of regular milk because it is supposedly healthier than traditional milk

Fairlife is also lactose free.

'It's basically the premiumization of milk,' Sandy Douglas, a senior vice president at Coca-Cola's North American operation at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer Conference last week.

The company has had success in advertising healthier beverages with their Simply juice line which has done well despite the fruit juice industry starting to slump.

Fruit juices are also packed with sugars and are a major contributor along with soft drinks to childhood obesity. 

CBS reports that Coca-Cola advertises Simlpy juices as being healthier, unsweetened, and never frozen.

'Our ambition there is to create the Simply of milk,' Douglas said of the new product.

American shoppers have flocked towards higher protein products like Yogurt and less are buying items with high sugar contents.

'Protein is the fastest-growing segment of the beverage category,' Mike Saint John, president of Coca-Cola North America's Minute Maid business unit, told the Dairy Today.

Dress to drink: In this advertisement for Fairlife a woman wears a dress made of milk that resembles Marilyn Monroe's famous white ensemble

Despite the growing popularity of high protein products, Dairy Today reports that one of every two adults doesn't drink milk at all.

Milk sales have also declined by 8 per cent over the last ten years.

What Coca-Cola aims to do is advertise how Fairlife is healthier than traditional milk because it's cold-filtered to concentrate protein and remove fat and sugar. 

Coca-Cola already sells a protein shake called Core Power which goes through the same filtration process.

In order to build hype around the new milk, Coca-Cola has developed provocative ads which they launched earlier this year in Minnesota of women wearing dresses made from milk, reports Business Insider. 

'Swing into something better,' says one advertisement picturing a woman in a dress made of milk hanging from a swing.

'Milk with flair,' reads another ad picturing a woman in a dress made from milk that resembles an iconic image of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress.

Despite the Milk industry being on the decline, Coca-Cola believes that their premium product equipped with a premium price tag will reel in the cash flow.

'Now to be clear, we're going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it won't rain money in the early couple of years,' Douglas said at last week's conference. 

'But like Simply, when you do it well, it rains money later.'

Moove over Coca-Cola: The advertisements for Fairlife not only depict women in milk dresses that cling closely to their bodies, they advertise the health benefits of the product such as more calcium
