It was at the Hawthorns last April that West Ham fans unfurled a banner reading ‘Fat Sam Out: Killing WHU’. 

Eight months later, they are a happier bunch. ‘We’re gonna win the league,’ the travelling supporters sang.

A case of two extremes certainly, but this was another victory to cement the standing of both Sam Allardyce and West Ham. They remain fifth and looking up.

West Bromwich Albion can only look over their shoulders. 

Alan Irvine has overseen a fourth successive loss, as the relegation places loom closer.

Fan chants told his story too. ‘Taxi for Irvine,’ the home crowd shouted. 

They have seen their team win only three times in the Premier League this calendar year.

Irvine said: ‘It’s not going to help but I can’t control that, the fans have every right to behave in every way they chose. 

'I’ve said we are a lot stronger if everybody is pulling in the same direction. 

'It comes with the territory. It’s not that long since Sam went through it.’

Irvine evidently lacks full confidence in his squad players to alter starting line-ups much. 

Summer signing Silvestre Varela was brought on in the second half for only his second appearance of the season. 

Striker Brown Ideye, who cost £9million, came on with six minutes to go for his first outing since late October.

It is quite the opposite for Allardyce, who won here without starting Enner Valencia or the injured Diafra Sakho – two players who lit up West Ham’s opening games.

Kevin Nolan scored his first goal since February on his return to the side, while James Tomkins found the winner with a header on the stroke of half-time. 

Craig Dawson had given Albion an early lead but the high spirits soon faded.

‘Our summer months of hard work in recruiting terms and pre season are still paying off for us,’ said Allardyce. 

‘It wasn’t great but it was resilient. Coming back from 1-0 down away from home is always a big task.’

West Brom took the lead in the 10th minute when Victor Anichebe turned Tomkins and earned a free-kick on the angle of the area.

Graham Dorrans whipped across a devious ball, but it was far too simple for Dawson to bound into the six-yard area, past Tomkins, and find a glancing header into the net.

Given Albion’s last goal came virtue of the rather unfortunate Esteban Cambiasso in victory at Leicester, this broke a run of 370 minutes since someone on the payroll had scored.

It was reward for a bright start, but near enough straight away the hosts began to sit back.

West Ham needed no invitation to attack. 

By half-time the visitors were ahead.

Nolan, at 32, is less of a fixture in Allardyce’s side than he once was but he still possesses an uncanny ability at close range. 

In the 35th minute Stewart Downing flung a free-kick into the area. 

Chris Brunt only cleared Tomkins’ header into the air and Andy Carroll connected in spectacular fashion with a bicycle kick that flew at goal.

Ben Foster sprang to save but Nolan had ghosted into the six-yard box and nodded the rebound in – his first goal since February 22.

On the stroke of half-time Brunt was forced off injured and West Ham went ahead. 

Foster pushed a shot from Cheikhou Kouyate round the post to concede a corner. 

Downing flighted it deep and Tomkins out-leapt Dawson to head home. 

A role reversal of earlier – and far too easy again.

Dawson had a chance to atone seven minutes after the interval, but dragged his shot horribly wide. 

Then, just as they did against Arsenal, West Brom roused to rally in the final 10 minutes.

Anichebe found space in the box and drove a shot at goal that Adrian saved with his legs, then Dorrans hit a volley that flashed just wide. 

Once again, it was too little, too late.
