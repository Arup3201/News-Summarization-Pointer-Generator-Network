Investigated: Sir Jimmy Saville was the subject of an investigation into claims he was accused of molesting girls

Sir Jimmy Saville was the subject of a two-month sex pest investigation by journalists from the BBC, it was claimed today.

Reporters from Newsnight launched a probe into allegations about inappropriate behaviour by the Jim'll Fix It legend towards schoolgirls just days after his death on October 29.

But they were eventually told to spike the story, which was due to be broadcast just days before a BBC1 Christmas special celebrating the presenter's life.

Newsnight journalists interviewed three women who met Sir Jimmy in the Seventies when, as presenter of Top Of The Pops, he was at the height of his fame, Sunday Mirror reported.

All three were teenage pupils at a school in Surrey which the broadcaster visited regularly as part of his charity work.

It is claimed that Sir Jimmy took girls there for rides in his car. Each of the women is said to have alleged that he had taken them out, individually, in his car and behaved inappropriately towards them.

One of the women, who is now in her 50s, agreed to waive her anonymity and allow herself to be interviewed by Newsnight reporters on camera, the Sunday Mirror said. 

The investigation was launched after journalists for the flagship BBC news programme discovered that complaints about Sir Jimmy were made to Surrey police in 2007 - nearly 40 years after the incidents were alleged to have taken place.

Police carried out their own investigation at the time, but the Crown Prosecution Service was not convinced there was enough evidence to take action against the star.

A BBC source told the Sunday Mirror 
that journalists hoped to establish the truth of the claims and the 
details of the police investigation by interviewing the three women.

But
senior figures in the corporation then told reporters to scrap the 
report, which would have clashed with a Boxing Day Jim'll Fix It tribute
programme hosted by Shane Richie.

The decision to spike the story is said to have angered many staff, who had spent months working on the report.

'Someone, somewhere should have realised that a report trying to uncover a dark side of one of the BBC’s favourite sons was a silly thing to do,' the source told the Sunday Mirror.

Surrey Police confirmed that allegations had been made and investigated, and a CPS spokesman said a reviewing lawyer had advised officers a lack of evidence meant no action could be taken.

Sir Jimmy's friends and family were upset at the revelations regarding the investigation.

The star's niece, Janet Humble accused Newsnight of 'muck-raking'. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'As a family we just wish Sir Jim could be left to rest in peace.'

Stephen Purdew, Sir Jimmy's friend of 30 years, who helped to organise his funeral, said: 'These are allegations from 40 years ago. He’s not even alive to defend himself.'

The BBC today insisted that Newsnight's investigation focused on alleged failings within the CPS, and the story was spiked because they did not have enough proof to stand it up - not because of executive interference.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion that a story was dropped for anything other than editorial reasons is completely untrue.

'The BBC gathers information on hundreds of stories and not all make it to air. In this case the angle we were pursuing could not be substantiated.'
