A 'shopaholic' wife plotted to murder 
her husband in a revenge attack so she could claim his £250,000 life 
insurance money as pay back for blinding her in one eye, a court has 
heard.

Lisa Fairpo, 36, took
a new lover who offered to pay £10,000 to a former paratrooper if he 
stabbed her estranged husband Andrew Burr to death - so that he 
'suffered' rather than meeting a quick end, it was said.

But
Hull Crown Court heard the revenge plot - launched after Mr Burr 
blinded Fairpo - was uncovered when the intended hit man fled to
London and told police, unable to go through with the murder.

Lisa Fairpo is accused of plotting to kill her husband for his life insurance cash. She is said to have taken a new lover who offered to pay £10,000 to a former paratrooper if he stabbed her estranged husband Andrew Burr

A
jury was told that weeks before the plot, Fairpo persuaded her husband 
to increase his life insurance from £26,000 to £250,000.

The court heard that she even handed him the contact number for the broker and offered to pay the premium.

Fairpo and her husband were estranged and she was said to be having an affair with Darren Wilson, a loan shark. 

She met the 45-year-old while she was fostering his son over the course of four years.

Maikel Ward hitman in conspiracy to murder Andrew Burr. He was allededly going to kill Mr Burr for £10,000

The pair, from Hull, both deny conspiracy to murder Mr Burr, between January 1 and April 13 this year.

Prosecution
said it had been the pair's intention to teach Mr Burr a lesson for 
blinding her with a punch to her eye, and to claim life insurance.

But when asked if there had been discussions 
with Wilson about doing something to her husband she said: 'I might once
have said, when me and Andy were really arguing, I’d have maybe said Oh
God! I wish Andy wasn't here!'

Prosecutor
Mark McKone said: 'The prosecution says Lisa Fairpo and Darren Wilson 
intended to kill Mrs Fairpo's husband in order to collect life 
insurance… They have been together 13 years and married in 2005. Lisa 
Fairpo was a shopaholic and they had massive debts.'

He
added: 'In April 2013 Lisa Fairpo offered to pay a £71 premium for 
increased life insurance from £26,000 to £250,000. In fact £750,000 
insurance was discussed by Andrew Burr with his insurance provider.

'Significantly
around the same time Lisa Fairpo was arranging for her husband to be 
well insured, Wilson was making arrangement for her husband to be 
killed.'

The jury was told 
that before the plan could be enacted the intended hitman, Maikel Ward, 
42, fled to London and called the police saying he was unable to go 
through with it.

But Hull Crown Court heard the revenge plot, launched after Mr Burr blinded her in one eye, was uncovered when the intended hit man fled to London and told police, unable to go through with the murder

He said he had come to his senses and wanted to stop 
another man going through with murder.

He said he
owed Wilson £1,500 for a debt he could not repay and that he had been 
asked to stab the victim, who was 'quite old' and would not be too much 
trouble.

Fairpo told
police when she was arrested that she was heavily in debt and her 
husband was violent.

She added that she no longer loved him, but he was a great dad and she could never hurt him.

She
said the holidays with Wilson were as friends and they had only had sex
once. She said she felt both scared and safe with Wilson. 

Because of her sight problems Mrs Fairpo is allowed to sit in court wearing dark sunglasses.

Mr McKone said Wilson made no comment in police interview.

Ward - the hitman-  has already pleaded guilty to the conspiracy.

Mr
McKone added: 'Ward did not name of the victim, but Wilson was to ask 
him (the victim) to quote for a job in an empty house as a painter and 
decorator.

Wilson wanted ward to stab him and said the man was quite old
so it would not be a problem.

Ward,
an ex-solder, had suggested a gun would be better, but Wilson said he 
did not think he could get a gun and he wanted his victim to suffer.'

He
said Ward he truly believed Mr Wilson wanted someone dead as he had 
told him he had organised details and that he would be in contact over 
the next couple of weeks.

The trial continues.
