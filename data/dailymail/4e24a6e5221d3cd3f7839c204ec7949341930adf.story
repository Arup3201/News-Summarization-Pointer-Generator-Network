Boris Becker has had his £15million Majorca villa seized by the Spanish authorities over an unpaid wage bill of £246,000 to his gardener.

A Spanish court ordered the sequestration of the German tennis ace's 700,000 sq ft ranch-style house and grounds called Son Coll until the bill is paid to the groundsman.

It is the latest in a long string of financial headaches that the luxurious villa has caused the triple Wimbledon winner over the last 14 years.

He has been unsuccessfully trying to 
sell the villa since 2007, which is why he has had to pay such an 
enormous upkeep on the massive grounds that comes to exactly £246,225.46
to keep it in pristine condition for potential buyers.

Groundsmen grief: The dispute has spiralled from an unpaid wage

Becker's lawyer argued before a court on the island that the sum can only be paid by his client when the property is sold by celebrity German realtor Matthias Kuehn.

Kuehn said he is not responsible for settling Becker's gardening debts before it is sold.

Becker tried to play down the severity of the punishment, telling German newspaper Bild: 'It's not so dramatic. But if someone believes they have suffered an injustice it is up to him to seek redress.

'The procedure is ongoing so I can say no more.'

The father-of-four bought the villa with his former wife Barbara in 1997. He was fined 
close to £190,000 by a court in 2004 for unauthorised changes to it 
during construction.

Despite
the fine he took pleasure in his achievements at the site, which boasts
a massive garden with orange trees, a guest house, pool, tennis and 
basketball courts and spreads out over 75 acres.

'I come from a 
family of architects and interior designers. I was on a building site 
before I was playing tennis. So I was very much involved,' he said.

When
the tennis star, who won Wimbledon for the first time aged 17, 
initially put it on the market he explained that the home was meant to 
be used by a big family.

'The
whole idea was a family house, but now, my two boys are in Miami and my
daughter is in London, so that’s two or three weeks a year here, and 
that’s it,' he said.

His ex-wife Barbara took a massive £10million, plus a £1.8million pound house in Florida,  from him in a divorce settlement following his 1999 fling in a cleaning cupboard at the posh London restaurant Nobu with Russian emigre Angela Ermakova. 

That led to the birth of daughter Anna, the purchase of a £1million flat for her and her mother in London plus maintenance payments.

But there is more bad news in store for Boris with the villa German newspapers dub the 'house of horrors.' 

A builder is claiming £500,000 from him for unpaid work and a court case is underway.

Becker, who just narrowly escaped a jail sentence a few years ago on tax evasion charges, now lives in Switzerland after marrying his partner Lilly Kerssenberg.

But the red-headed prodigy will have to forget his villa woes, as is currently in Wimbledon commentating on the championship.
