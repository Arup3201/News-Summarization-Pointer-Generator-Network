The stepmother of a young boy who died lied about his whereabouts to police.

Analize Osceola of Hollywood, Florida, called police on Thursday to say that Ahizya Osceola, 3, was missing.

This despite the fact that hours earlier she had found the boy dead and stuffed his heavily bruised body into a trash bag that she then hid in her laundry room.

Child Protective Services documents obtained by NBC 6 state that Analize woke up at around 4am last Thursday and, according to her claims, she heard the young boy moaning.

She then went over and found he was very cold, but still warm, so she gave him CPR.

With his pulse weak, she then claims she went to get him some Pedialyte, then decided it was best to try and make him vomit.

The boy, she claims, died soon after, and she waited until the other adults were out of the house and then stuffed the boy's dead body in a trash bag and hid it in the laundry room.

Throughout this all, Analize's mother had been in the house, who is a nurse.

She never told her mother anything about what happened or asked her to help when the boy was in distress.

Police, suspicious of the woman, went to the house and found the body. 

Soon after she changed her story with police she checked herself into a mental hospital.

The father of Ahizya, Nelson (above), claims the boy was covered in bruises all over his body because he often fell

Friends, family and neighbors have set up a memorial for the boy outside his home (above)

The father of Ahizya, Nelson, claims the boy was covered in bruises all over his body because he often fell.

Analize's son Cameron, 5, from a previous relationship, and the couple's newborn, 8-month-old Candy, have both been removed from their custody.

Judge Hope Bristol said that Nelson will also not be allowed near his cildren at this time.

An autopsy report will be released on Thursday, and police have not revealed if they have any suspects at this time.
