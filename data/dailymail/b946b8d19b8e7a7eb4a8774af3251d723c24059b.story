The mistress of a Navy doctor has testified against his widow who stabbed her husband to death in a jealous rage over the affair.

Dr Danielle Robins, 31, told jurors at the trial of Jennifer Trayers, 43, that she was in love and claimed she was planning a future with the defendant's husband Navy Lt. Cmdr. Frederick Trayers.

During her testimony on Wednesday, Dr Robins said that her 41-year-old lover had said that he planned to leave his wife for her, but she ended the affair after he told her that his wife was pregnant.

Dr Robins was a 30-year-old medical student in the Navy when she met and fell in love with the married ER doctor, while they were both working aboard the USS Mercy in 2010.

Although she knew that Lt. Cmdr Trayers had been married for nearly 20 years, Dr Robins continued the affair, reports 10news.com.

'Every time we would talk and communicate I would just feel more connected," Dr Robins said.

'He said they had issues and he was unhappy for a long time.'

The defense that Lt. Cmdr Trayers was lying and that his wife was never pregnant.

Trayers was visibly tense as she listened to her husband's mistress recount details of the affair including secret meetings.

'You told us at some point that in your room at the BOQ, Mr Trayers comes over and at some point, your words were, 'The clothes came off.' Is that right?" asked a prosecutor to which Dr Robins replied yes, reports 10news.com.

Prosecutor said that evidence will reveal that Mrs Trayers waited to catch her husband unprepared, that she armed herself with the knife before attacking him with 'planned marksmanship'.

Police responding to the scene found Lt. Cmdr Trayers curled up in his bed, and his wife lying nearby with apparently self-inflicted stab wounds, two days after the stabbing.

Trayer's lawyer does not deny his client killed her husband but claims she  is guilty of voluntary manslaughter, not murder.

He says she lost control while they were wrestling over a knife, reports 10news.com.

He said that she took the knife intending to commit suicide, and started stabbing him after he offered to help her kill herself.

She claims that after the first stab or two she does not remember the rest of the attack or the two days following it.

The same day of the murder, she had also sent Dr Robins a chilling eight-page email telling her, 'My husband is not going to be yours.'

Lt. Cmdr Trayers and his wife both had a history of infidelity and were in marriage counseling, reports 10news.com.

The trial will continue on Thursday when Trayers is expected to give evidence.
