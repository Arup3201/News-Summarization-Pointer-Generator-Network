ABC news producer Dawn Ennis who changed gender three times was fired in May for 'performance-related issues'

An ABC news producer who changed gender three times has been fired for 'performance-related issues', according to reports.

Dawn Ennis, who was once known as Don Ennis, identified as both a man and a woman during a long career at the company.

The producer, from Danbury, Connecticut, lost her job in May just a few weeks after transforming from her male identity. 

An industry source told the New York Daily News that Ennis losing the job was not because of gender-identity issues.

ABC News declined to comment to MailOnline on Tuesday.

In
 May 2013, Don Ennis appeared at work wearing a black dress and an 
auburn wig, and asked that co-workers call him Dawn.

She reportedly 
received a very public show of support from her longtime colleagues.

The
 father-of-three explained to colleagues that she believed her gender 
mix-up was linked to her mother giving her oestrogen as a child to 
prolong a childhood acting career.

Ennis said she ended up developing breasts and thinking as a woman.

Soon afterwards, the producer separated from wife Wendy after 17 years. Then three months after revealing her new identity to colleagues, the senior ABC employee returned to work as Don and claimed to have suffered from 'transient global amnesia'.

Ennis said he had believed it was 1999 and thought that his wife had tricked him into dressing up as a woman.

According to the New York Post, Ennis posted a memo on the newsroom bulletin board which read: 'I accused my wife of playing some kind of cruel joke, dressing me up in a wig and bra and making fake ID’s with the name ''Dawn'' on it. Seriously.'

The journalist explained that while his memories of the last 14 years had returned, his female identity did not.

In the memo, first reported on gossip site NewsBlues, Ennis added: 'I am writing to let you know I’m changing my name . . . to Don Ennis. That will be my name again, now and forever. And it appears I’m not transgender after all.'

The producer thanked colleagues at ABC for their support and said that he hoped the experience would make it easier for the next transgender person at ABC.

In May, 49-year-old Ennis became Dawn again. She was let go from the company soon afterwards.

On May 31, she posted on Facebook: 'It is all going to work out.' On June 2, Dawn Ennis then published lines from Shakespeare's King Lear on her Facebook page, which read: 'No, I will weep no more. In such a night/ To shut me out? Pour on; I will endure.'
