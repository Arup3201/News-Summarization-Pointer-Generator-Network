A small child was just inches away from an armed robbery yesterday.

Surveillance footage from the McDonald's in Houston, Texas shows a little boy dangerously close to the gunman.

The footage shows four men walking into the fast food chain casually as though they are going to order food.

Protected: This little boy is yanked away by a family members as armed robbers threaten the McDonald's cashier with a gun 

Theft: The robbers successfully scared the cashier into giving them money just a week after the suspects robbed several other stores 

Their behavior changes suddenly as a man pulls out a gun and points it at the cashier and dangerously close to an innocent young boy.

Witnesses at the McDonald’s robbery were horrified to see the boy so close to the gun but the little boy's family member was able to quickly yank him out of harm's way. 

Luckily no one was injured in the robbery.  

Police say the men are the same four who went on a crime spree last week.

Just last Thursday, a Specs and four cell phone stores were robbed, reports KHOU. 

'Oh my God and I was there yesterday. I see the police here,' said Maria Gonzalez, to KHOU.

'I know you wouldn't want that around your kids, respect the kids,' said one customer.

Customers sympathized with staff members who are merely trying to make an honest living.

One petrified employee was forced to get an undisclosed amount of money from the back room as a suspect stood over him with a gun.

A nearby McDonald's was also robbed later that day.

The suspects are still on the run but are asking anyone with tips to call 713-222-tips.

"It's not something we want to promote in our community,' said a customer.

'It's kind of scary, really scary,' said Omar Gonzalez, a customer.

Armed: This robber pointed a gun at the cashier and the boy was just inches away from him 

Target: Police are on the hunt for the suspects who robbed this McDonald's along with another one later that day
