Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, is calling for abortion pill RU486 to be made legal in the Northern Territory 

An expert in family planning says the Northern Territory still have a 'cowboy mentality' because medical termination pill RU486 is still illegal in the state.  

Robyn Wardle, CEO for Family Planning NT, wants the pill to be legalised in the region so women don't have to wait until they are at least seven weeks pregnant for a surgical procedure where they will be put under anaesthetic. 

The NT is the only state in Australia that has not made the pills legal under the Medical Services Act. 

Family Planning NT say they have been campaigning the government for 12 months and seen no movement in their agenda.  

Ms Wardle told Daily Mail Australia: 'Our goal is to educate the health services and it's just so unfair that women in the NT don't have the same rights as those everywhere else in Australia.' 

'Half the women who come into our clinics want the medical termination and we cannot offer it to them, it's a crime. 

'It's just beyond me why this has not been reviewed, it's shocking, the government is working from a law that is 40 years old, so much has changed and modernised since then. 

'The issue doesn't really come to anyone's attention unless you need that service yourself.

'The medical termination is less invasive and women don't have to wait weeks for an outcome. 

'Once a woman has made the decision that she wants to have a termination she wants it done as quickly as possible and doesn't want to have to wait weeks, it's very disappointing for them. 

'This law has needed to be changed for years. It is unfair for health staff having to work under a law that is so old. 

Medical abortion pill RU486 remains illegal in the Northern Territory under the Medical Services Act 

Surgical termination is legal in the NT but it can only be  performed in a hospital by a gynaecologist, campaigners also want this word removed from legislation so more medical professionals can perform the procedure. 

Ms Wardle told Daily Mail Australia that there is just one doctor in Darwin who flies to the region from Adelaide each week to perform the surgical procedures. 

'This is because we don't have enough doctors who are willing to perform it. The gynaecologists decide if they want to do them or not. 

'There are no other doctors in the NT that are within the public health system that want to perform the terminations, there are a couple of doctors in the private sector who will do them but some women up here just cannot afford that.' 

Some women are resorting to buying the drug off the internet and taking it unsupervised at home without medical attention, Ms Wardle explained.

She said: 'Women can buy this off the shelf in India and I have heard of cases where they are either getting it off the internet or family members have posted the drug up from other states in Australia. 

Ms Wardle said: 'Women can buy this off the shelf in India, we need to have it in the NT'

'When a woman is desperate she will do anything. I have also heard of women travelling interstate to have a medical abortion in Western Australia or Queensland. 

'We have backpackers come to us when they have got pregnant and they can't believe we don't offer the pills, they think we are joking. 

'Half the population of the NT are women and we should have the same choices and rights as the women across the country.' 

Ms Wardle said she believed the NT government had a 'flippant attitude' towards the drug and think it is an easy way out for a woman who is pregnant. 

Last year NT Health Minister Robyn Lambley told the NT News that the Cabinet had not discussed the legalisation of the drug properly and they were a 'long way off making a final decision'.

A spokesman for Ms Lambley told Daily Mail Australia 'she has said before she is looking into it but there is no new statement coming out on it at the moment'.
