Owess Khan was jailed for three years yesterday after admitting to charges of conspiracy to supply cocaine and escape

A criminal who told police he could barely walk after being injured during his arrest escaped from hospital by leaping from his wheelchair and running away.

Owess Khan, 25, claimed he had badly hurt his knee after falling off a bench while being arrested for conspiracy to supply cocaine in June this year.

However when officers took the handcuffed suspect to Burnley General Hospital to see a doctor he sprung from his wheelchair, pushed two police guards to the ground, and made his escape.

He was found the next day at his girlfriend's house having run home and used a hacksaw to remove his handcuffs.

Appearing at Burnely Crown Court yesterday, he admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and escape and was jailed for three years yesterday.

Officers were called to reports of a man loitering outside a car near Burnley Town Hall on June 26.

When they arrived they found Khan sitting on a bench and a man in the vehicle with £360 of cocaine, divided into £20 'wraps' for sale.

Khan was found with £170 in cash and a mobile phone with drug-related messages on it, dating back for two months.

He was kept in a police station overnight, but complained that he had seriously hurt his knee and so was taken to hospital the next day where he escaped, leaving his guards with minor injuries.

Khan complained to officers that he had hurt his knee during his arrest, but when they took him to Burnley General Hospital (pictured) he jumped from his wheelchair and ran away

Police found the 'compliant' Khan at around 12pm the next day sitting on his girlfriend's sofa, saying he had run straight home.

The court heard Khan had been locked up for 33 weeks in July for an unrelated assault on an ex-youth worker.

Judge Andrew Woolman told him: 'You are clearly a bright young man, who can do other things rather than peddling drugs around the streets.'
