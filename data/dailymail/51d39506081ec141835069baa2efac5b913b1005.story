Eight U.S. Army soldiers have been charged over the death of an Asian-American soldier in Afghanistan who was allegedly severely racially bullied.

Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide.

The Army described Private Chen as having ‘an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound’ when found in southern Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

In action: Sergeant Travis F. Carden was one of eight soldiers charged

But it is now no longer clear whether Private Chen, who was from the Chinatown area of Manhattan, did in fact take his own life.

The eight soldiers from his company 
face charges ranging from dereliction of duty, assault, negligent 
homicide and involuntary manslaughter.

Hundreds of supporters held a vigil last
week after demanding officials address the treatment of Asians in the 
military, reported MSNBC.

His cousin Banny Chen read out a 
letter sent by Private Chen in February at the vigil last Thursday, 
which said: ‘Everyone knows me by Chen’.

‘They ask if I'm from China a few 
times a day,’ he wrote. ‘They also call out my name Chen in a goat-like 
voice sometimes for no reason.

‘People crack jokes about Chinese people all the time. I'm running out of jokes to come back at them.’

Around 400 people were at the vigil and march last week in Manhattan as Occupy Wall Street protesters also got involved.

Asian Pacific Americans civil rights 
group OCA has expressed outrage at what happened and have their own 
theory on why he was allegedly abused.

‘They did it because they knew that there was an environment that they would get away with it,’ an OCA spokesman said, reported NBC New York.

Relatives of Private Chen said on Wednesday they are encouraged to learn of the charges brought.

His father Yen Tao Chen said the family realises he will never return, but the news 'gives us some hope'.

First Lieutenant Daniel J. Schwartz, Staff Sergeant Blaine G. Dugas and Staff Sergeant Andrew J. Van Bockel were all charged.

Sergeant Adam M. 
Holcomb, Sergeant Jeffrey T. Hurst, Specialist Thomas P. Curtis, Specialist Ryan J. Offutt and Sergeant Travis F. Carden were also charged.

All eight soldiers are of 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker 
Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.
