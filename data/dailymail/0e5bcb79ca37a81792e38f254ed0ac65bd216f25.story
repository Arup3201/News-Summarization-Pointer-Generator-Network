No sale: Tracey Trigg, 51, pictured with her son Josh, 24, and daughter Ella, 13, was stopped from buying alcohol twice in a week at an Asda store

Asda checkout staff are blocking parents from buying alcohol if they have their children with them.

Although it is legal for anyone over the age of 18 to buy alcohol, over-zealous workers are saying no to parents who take their children shopping with them.

And rather than apologising, Asda bosses have backed their staff, saying it is better that they were ‘over cautious’ rather than face prosecution for selling alcohol to under-18s.

Most supermarkets have introduced a policy on drink sales where staff are expected to challenge anyone who looks under 25 to prove they are over 18.

They are also able to ban shoppers from buying alcohol if there are ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe it might be passed on to someone aged under 18.

Supermarket executives have handed the power to police the system to checkout workers, who have autonomy over who they stop and refuse to serve.

The issue has been highlighted by  51-year-old mother-of-three Tracey Trigg, from Boston, Lincolnshire, who was stopped from buying drink along with groceries twice in a week at an Asda store.

In the first case, she was buying a bottle of wine with some food and was with her 24-year-old university graduate son, Josh, who was helping to carry the bags.

The second time she was with Josh and her daughter, Ella, aged 13, who were helping with the shopping, which included some beer and wine for Christmas.

Mrs Trigg, who works in social care, said she was twice stopped from making a legal purchase. The first refusal was because Josh had no ID to prove he was over 18, and the second because Ella had no ID.

Controversial: Asda bosses claim it is better to be 'over cautious' than to risk prosecution for selling alcohol to under-18s. However Mrs Trigg, right, claims the ages of her children should not affect her right to buy alcohol

Mrs Trigg said the ages of her children were irrelevant, but checkout staff told her the heavy-handed tactics were necessary because they can be prosecuted and given an £80 on-the-spot fine for selling drink to someone who passes it on to someone under 18. 

She said: ‘There can be no doubt in anyone’s mind that I am old enough to buy wine and beer. These are legal products, it is not like I was trying to buy a caged wild animal.’

She added: ‘It really should not be so difficult for a working mum to be able to go and buy some drink for Christmas. My kids were just there helping to pack the trolley and bags. When I am carrying heavy things, I need the help.

Examples of heavy-handed supermarkets stopping adults buying alcohol:

Sept 2013: Father-of-three Charles Brown, aged 50, was stopped from buying a bottle of whisky by a cashier at Morrisons, in Huddersfield, who asked him to prove he was over 18.

Aug 2013: A mother with a broken hand was left angry and embarrassed after being told she could not buy alcohol in a Leamington supermarket because her 17-year-old daughter was helping her pack.

July 2013: Staff at a Tesco in Taunton refused to allow a 43-year-old woman to buy drink for a barbecue because she was with her 17-year-old son.

June 2013: A 77-year-old man was stopped from buying a crate of lager from a Co-op in Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, because he had his 13-year-old grandson with him.

Dec 2012: A seriously ill teenager, aged 18, was stopped from buying Christmas gift sets containing alcohol at an Asda in Lowestoft. Staff stopped the purchase because the 18-year-old was with her sister, aged 17, who had lifted the items on to the conveyor  belt at the till.

‘These policies make going through the till very stressful. Do parents have to start being devious and telling youngsters to wait by the front door while they put the shopping through the till?

‘I am an adult and a mother. Why does a supermarket or the state feel they can tell me whether or not I can buy products that are legal?’

Asda defended its policy, saying: ‘Although it may seem a bit heavy-handed, we don’t blame our colleagues for being over-cautious.

'If they serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 18 the law says they will be held personally responsible and could be handed an on-the-spot fine.

'Where there is any element of doubt we support our colleagues to make the right decision. We are committed to selling alcohol responsibly.’

Other leading supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and the Co-op, said they also expected checkout staff to demand ID where a shopper appeared to be under 25.

They said workers can also refuse a sale if they have ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe the drink might be passed on to someone under 18.

The idea of ‘reasonable grounds’ is such a grey area that it effectively gives till workers freedom over whether to allow adults to buy drink.

As a result, there is an increasing number of examples of adults being turned down.

Despite cracking down on parents trying to buy a bottle of wine with their children, supermarkets have been keen to take advantage of more relaxed licensing laws.

According to Home Office figures, 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock.

They make up 13 per cent – or one in every eight – of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours.

Police have declared 24-hour drinking a failed experiment which has led to widespread disorder on Britain’s streets.

Officers have blamed the sale of alcohol by supermarkets for much of the problem.
