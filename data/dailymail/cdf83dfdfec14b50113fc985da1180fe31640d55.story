Jonny Evans could be out of action for up to a month after the Manchester United defender suffered an ankle injury in Sunday’s shocking 5-3 defeat at Leicester City.

Evans, who has a history of ankle trouble and needed surgery two years ago, is still on crutches after limping off in the first half at the King Power Stadium.

The Northern Ireland defender had a scan on Monday and the initial assessment among United’s medical staff is that he be sidelined for four weeks.

With Phil Jones recovering from a hamstring strain and Tyler Blackett suspended following his sending-off at Leicester, Louis van Gaal is running out of defensive options for Saturday’s game against West Ham at Old Trafford.

Van Gaal has already indicated that England left-back Luke Shaw will finally make his competitive debut for United following a £27million summer move from Southampton, with Marcos Rojo set to partner Chris Smalling in central defence.

‘I think that Shaw shall be fit enough to play,’ said the United boss. ‘Rojo can play and Smalling can play, so we can manage. But it’s a thin choice.’
