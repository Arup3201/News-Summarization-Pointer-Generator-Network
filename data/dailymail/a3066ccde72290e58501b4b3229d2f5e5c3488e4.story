A care home for elderly people has been criticised by a government health watchdog because most of it staff spoke poor English - and for playing Bhangra music to residents.

The owners of the Parkview Nursing and Residential Home in Bolton could face a financial penalty if they do not make improvements, inspectors for the Care Quality Commission (CQC) have warned.

The caution comes following a surprise inspection carried out by the CQC, which uncovered a catalogue of failures.

Bhangra music - Punjabi pop often featured in Bollywood films - was played in one residentâ€™s room and, then later, an Asian language radio station - despite their first language being English, and the care plan indicating they liked classical music.

And some residents said the majority of staff were hard to understand as their first language was not English.

Despite the manager insisting that staff had been informed of English language classes to improve their communication, no member of staff had shown any interest.

Inspectors also found some residents looking dehydrated and could find no evidence of staff recording their fluid or food intake.

Assessors also said no system was in place to monitor the quality of care and the service provided and that they found loud pop music 'blaring out' in the lounge areas.

The CQC's report has now been published and a formal warning to protect the safety and welfare of the residents has been issued to owners Jewelglen Limited.

It has been ordered to improve standards by July 16 or face a possible suspension or cancellation of services, which the CQC can do in serious cases. It could also face a financial penalty.

Despite the concerns highlighted in the report, the inspectors found positive elements to the care home.

The home contained cards and letters thanking staff for their care and support and no residents made any negative comments about the attitude or care of the staff.

Staff were also observed speaking in a polite manner when addressing the residents and a district nurse said the home always followed instructions.

The home, which was inspected on May 14, cares for up to 41 residents with physical difficulties.

Mahendra Raja, the home's owner, said the concerns raised had been addressed and solutions would be in order before the next inspection.
