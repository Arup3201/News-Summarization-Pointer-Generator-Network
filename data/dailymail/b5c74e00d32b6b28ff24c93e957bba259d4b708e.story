Well, no one can say they didn’t get value for money. On a night when Hull’s £10million record signing Abel Hernandez announced his arrival in English football with an excellent goal, he was upstaged by West Ham’s new £12m man Enner Valencia.

It did not end there. Hull’s other debutant Mohamed Diame, who left Upton Park under something of a cloud two weeks ago to move to Humberside, appeared to have stolen the headlines when he scored against his old club but Diafra Sakho, another of West Ham’s new signings from Metz, saw his shot helped over the line by the hapless Curtis Davies.

It was difficult to know who was happier with a point from an entertaining contest between two managers who are not always known for their open style of play.

Man of the Match: Abel Hernandez

Sam Allardyce even set up West Ham with a midfield diamond formation that helped produce the kind of flowing football the club’s owners and supporters have demanded of him for so long.

‘I’m sure me and Sam will have a beer now and say “hey, we don’t normally play like that”,’ admitted Hull boss Steve Bruce.

Yet, amazingly, we had to wait half an hour for the first shot in anger, a wayward effort from Stewart Downing that flew well wide.

It was the trigger for a frenetic end to the first half that saw Valencia and Sakho go close before Hernandez struck. The Uruguayan had only secured a work permit and trained with his new teammates for the first time over the weekend before Bruce took the decision to start him.

When Jake Livermore knocked the ball back to Ahmed Elmohamady on the right and his cross picked out Hernandez, the former Palermo striker got up ahead of James Tomkins to send a fantastic header swerving inside Adrian’s left-hand post.

‘He was full of life in training and that was what made my mind up, so I thought just throw him in,’ said Bruce. ‘But if you saw him now poor kid!

‘He has been waiting for two weeks. He has been away in Japan and South Korea and then stuck in Rome for the past couple of days waiting for his passport. We picked up his work permit on Friday and flew to Italy to get him.’

Hernandez almost had another goal with a cracking effort off the underside of the bar — Nikica Jelavic was offside when he headed in from the rebound — but it was nothing compared to Valencia’s wonder strike in the 50th minute. 

Valencia appeared to have run out of options when he carried the ball infield and came to a halt 25 yards from goal. There was almost no backlift at all as he took aim and sent a spectacular effort flying beyond Allan McGregor and into the top corner.

The Ecuador World Cup star had already made two League appearances since arriving from Mexican club Pachuca, but this was his first start and he marked the occasion with his first goal. And what a goal it was.

‘Everyone can see why we bought him with that strike,’ said Allardyce. ‘It was one of the best we’ll see this season. The power and the accuracy of the shot was past McGregor before he could even move. It stunned the whole stadium, it was that good.’

With 25 minutes to go, Diame of all people struck against his old club. Worse still for West Ham, it came from their own throw-in from Aaron Cresswell. His delivery was aimed towards Cheikhou Kouyate but Diame touched it away from him and closed in on goal.

There was still plenty to do as Tomkins tried to block his path but the man from Senegal could not have placed it any better, curling the ball around the defender and just inside the post.

Did Big Sam see that one coming from his old player? ‘Yeah,’ he said. ‘What sickened me most was the way we gifted him the ball, but it would have sickened me more if it had been the winner.’

Thankfully for Allardyce, he only had to wait three minutes for the equaliser. Downing played a pass into Sakho whose his first-time shot squirmed past McGregor and Davies could only help it into the goal.

There was still time for Michael Dawson to rescue Hull when he intercepted Valencia’s downward header as it flew goalwards and chested it against the bar.

‘If that had gone in I was up and ready to start dancing,’ said Allardyce. ‘And that isn’t a pleasant sight.’
