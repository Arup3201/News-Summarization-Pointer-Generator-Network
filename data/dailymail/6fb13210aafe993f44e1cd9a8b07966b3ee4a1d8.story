A prankster seeking revenge on his best friend took inspiration from one of the most adored jokers of the nineties, by painting the man's house in Mr Blobby colours.

Builder Jon Ansett was shown up by his friend, Peter Price-Whittle, when the 30-year-old wrote his initials on thousands of pounds worth of his scaffolding.

Exacting revenge, the 37-year-old painted the exterior of his house in Dartford, Kent, bright pink with yellow blobs in an homage to Mr Blobby, the bumbling sidekick of Noel Edmonds in Noel's House Party.

Jon Ansett waited until his friend was on holiday to paint his house bright pink with yellow spots 

Mr Ansett decided to get his own back when he discovered 'PPW' written all over his scaffolding poles. 

Eager to get revenge, he waited until his friend was on holiday in Dubai to paint the semi-detached house.

Astonishingly, Price-Whittle's housemate failed to spot what was going on, and thought the prankster was a window cleaner.

When he returned home from holiday, the 30-year-old could not believe his eyes.  

 'I came back from holiday and my Facebook was just going crazy when I landed.

'I was like "huh?" and then I saw that while I was away he’d decided to paint my house pink and put Blobby spots on it, thinking he was funny,' Mr Price-Whittle said. 

Jon Ansett spent a week and £150 painting the house after his friend signed his initials on his scaffolding poles

The 30-year-old's said 'all the old grannies' laughed at his house as they walked past and that he would repaint it soon

'To be fair, he did do me good.' 

After repainting his house, he has vowed to pull another prank on his friend. 

'I don’t think some of the neighbours were particularly pleased but it was just a practical joke and of course I’m going to paint over it - it’s not going to stay.

'All the old grannies were laughing when they walked past and it’s made a lot of people smile, so that’s good.

'Anyway, I’ve got plans to get him back.'

Mr Ansett, who spent around £150 on the joke, said: 'I was doing a job for Pete so I put all the scaffolding up around his house and then I see he’s put his initials all over it.

'He thought it would be funny, so I thought, right.

'I waited for him to go on holiday and then I spent a good couple of hours painting his house pink and spray painting on the yellow dots.

'His housemate was in the house at the time - which I didn't know - but he just thought it was some window cleaners. 

'He’s alright about it, it’s just a laugh and a good bit of fun.

'If he gets me back, I’ve got something up my sleeve.'

Mr Blobby first appeared on Noel Edmonds’ Saturday night hit Noel’s House Party in 1993 and had a Christmas number one before disappearing from the spotlight in 1999.

The lovable character would fumble around celebrities being interviewed and crash into the set to try to stir a reaction. 

At the end of each prank his pink and yellow costume was undone, revealing Noel Edmonds inside.
