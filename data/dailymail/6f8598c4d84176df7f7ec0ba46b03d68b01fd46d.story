Lewis Hamilton’s world championship charge was boosted by the last-minute arrivals of his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, father Anthony and brother Nicolas in Abu Dhabi.

Hamilton, who secured the title with yet another win, had appeared mysteriously downcast ahead of the season finale.

But the presence of his popstar girlfriend, who performed in Zurich on Saturday night, father and brother in the paddock, as they all were for his famous championship win at the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2008, provided the Briton with a much-needed boost.

‘The energy that is in the crowd here and all the flags means the world to me,’ said Hamilton, who started behind pole-sitter Nico Rosberg. ‘I hope we can put on a good show for them.

‘I am going to do the same as I always did, race it like I stole it. I will always for the race for the win.

‘We’ll play it by ear, but I am racing to win. I am going to do my best to get as far ahead as possible. I feel great.’

That he did in style, storming to victory at the season finale in Abu Dhabi to beat Nico Rosberg, who failed to finish in the points after suffering an engine problem, to this year’s crown. 

Earlier this week, Hamilton had stated that none of his close family – bar a couple of cousins in the grandstands - would be in Abu Dhabi to support him.

Rosberg’s wife Vivian and entourage of friends were seen leaping around in the Mercedes garage on Saturday after the German clinched pole.
