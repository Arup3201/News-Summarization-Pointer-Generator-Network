A man has been brutally assaulted on a St. Louis light rail car after he refused to give his opinion on the shooting of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, last August.

David Autry, 43, was travelling home on the MetroLink train at 10pm on Monday when he was approached by a young man in a red T-shirt and baseball cap.

The shocking incident was captured on the train's surveillance camera and was also recorded by a passenger who posted his cell phone footage online.

The video shows the man in the red T-shirt approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train.

According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown.

'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.'

The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms. Two other men, described by police as in their 20s, then join in. 

As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping.

The train's surveillance cameras clearly captured  their faces and police have said that they face possible charges of third-degree assault.

David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh

The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment.

Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh.  

'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' 

Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle.

The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised over $1,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes.

Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in nearby Ferguson last August following an altercation. 

The incident sparked days of violent protests, as did the decision by a grand jury not to indict Wilson last November.

 

The train's surveillance cameras captured clear images of the attackers' faces. They face possible charges of third-degree assault, police said
