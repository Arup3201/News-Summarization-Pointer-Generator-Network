She shot to fame 30 years ago as the co-presenter of quiz show Countdown alongside Richard Whiteley.

And seven years after his tragic death, Carol Vorderman broke down in tears as she recalled her old friend, declaring: 'It really hurts. I loved him.'

The maths whiz worked with Mr Whiteley on the Channel 4 programme for 23-years since its inception in 1983.

Emotional: Carol Vorderman breaks down while discussing Richard Whiteley on Piers Morgan's Life Stories

He died in 2005 from complications after having heart surgery, aged 61.

On Piers Morgan’s Life Stories – to be screened on ITV1 tonight - Miss Vorderman, 51, remembered the much-loved host.

She said: ‘It still hurts very much. I loved him, I really loved him.

‘He was more than just nice, he was funny, funny, funny. Every time we were in studio together I would cry laughing. 

‘He was just a joy to be with and I loved him. Not in that way, just a genuine, pure thing.’

Close friends: Vorderman recalled her close working relationship with her Countdown colleague

In an emotional interview, the mother-of-two recalled the moment she heard of Mr Whiteley’s death.

She said:  ‘He’d gone in for a heart operation and I spoke to Kathy immediately afterwards and it was the first bit of good news we’d had…that the surgeon thought the operation had gone very well and hadn’t taken as long as they’d thought.

'And that was the first time in six weeks that I thought there was anything to feel joyous about.

Friends: Vorderman and Whiteley in 2005

‘Then the next day I didn’t hear anything. I was at somebody’s house and I was shaking with nerves and I was just worried about him. 

‘And then I was at home and the kids had gone to bed and then Claire [Pizey, Countdown executive producer] rang to say.’

Miss Vorderman, who currently presents ITV’s Loose Women, was famed for her quick-thinking arithmetic skills on Countdown.

Her 2008 departure from the show was marred by acrimony, after she reportedly refused to take a £900,000 cut to her salary and was barred from the studio.

After she left the presenter said: ‘The way it happened was very hurtful, particularly after having worked on Countdown for 26 years. It was vicious.

‘It was all about the 90 per cent pay cut and there was all this good cop, bad cop stuff going on. Then I gave in and said, "I’ll go."

‘It’s new Countdown now. I take no pleasure in it. I’ve been told I’m never welcome in the studio again, so it’s nothing to do with me.’

However, in her latest interview, Miss Vorderman revealed she would consider making a guest appearance on the long-running show – currently hosted by former Apprentice adviser Nick Hewer, 68 - saying: ‘Of course I would.’

Miss Vorderman also spoke about the 
breakdown of her second marriage, to management consultant Patrick King,
the father of her children, Katie, 20, and Cameron, 15.

The pair split in 2000 but made a ‘pact’ not to speak about the split in public.

She said: ‘I loved Paddy and Paddy loved me and we had a very, very happy marriage. 

‘I loved him more than I’ve ever loved anybody, a man. And we agreed that we wouldn’t talk about it publicly.’

Miss
Vorderman said she believed the pressures of her career contributed to 
their break-up, saying they would probably still be together if it had 
not been for her screen success.

She
said: 'I think it did have an influence, yes. Probably we would be 
together. We’re as friendly as we can be. We’ve got two great kids 
together.'
