Tory MPs hit out last night after the global boss of Nissan warned that his company would ‘reconsider’ its future in the UK if the country left the European Union.

Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Japanese car giant, said it could pull its investment and thousands of jobs if the UK voted to leave the EU – despite his high praise for the firm’s ‘blessed’ Sunderland factory. Eurosceptic Tory MPs said it was 
‘scaremongering on an industrial scale’ by a pro-European business 
leader speaking to a ‘biased’ BBC with a political agenda.

Sceptical: Brazilian-born Carlos Ghosn said a UK out of Europe is 'completely different' to the current system

They insisted that Nissan would be more likely – not less – to invest in a Britain freed from the shackles of Brussels bureaucracy.

Independent Labour peer Lord Stoddart accused Mr Ghosn of ‘bully-boy’ tactics of which he  should be ‘ashamed’, saying his intervention into UK politics was ‘extremely inappropriate and offensive’.

The row erupted after Brazilian-born 
Mr Ghosn, who also has French and Lebanese roots, unveiled Nissan’s new 
British-built Qashqai model with an effusive speech in London.

His
presence was hailed by Nissan executives as a major coup and a vote of 
confidence in Britain and the Sunderland factory which employs 6,500 
people.

But pressed later in a BBC interview as to whether Nissan would pull out of Britain if the UK voted to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: ‘If anything has to change we (would) need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future. It will have implications, obviously.’

David Cameron has promised a vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the general election in 2015.

Mr Ghosn added: ‘You cannot consider the UK independent of its environment. If the UK is part of Europe it’s a completely different situation than if it is not part of Europe.’

Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘This is scaremongering on an industrial scale. It also smacked of left-wing leading of the witness by a biased BBC.

'The whole interview sounded as if it had less to do with economic reality and more to do with pursuing an EU federalist agenda.

‘Why would Nissan want to jeopardise their success  by withdrawing the billions of  investment they have already made?’.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed Mr Ghosn’s ‘timely’ warning.

He said: ‘As the Conservative MPs tie themselves up in knots in Westminster today about their European obsessions . . . the head of Nissan says, “look, if you pull out of Europe, don’t think that companies like mine are necessarily going to carry on investing and employing many people”.’
