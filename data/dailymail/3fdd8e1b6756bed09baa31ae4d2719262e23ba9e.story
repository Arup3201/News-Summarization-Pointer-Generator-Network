In its continuing bid to take on TV networks, Netflix is busy preparing a slew of original programming.

To date, the site has already released eight series that are available only on the digital platform.

And this week, the company announced it hopes to have up to 20 original series running alongside its other shows and movies.

The California-based company has announced plans for more original shows. Speaking at a conference in New York, chief content officer Theodore Sarandos said the site would unveil about 20 shows for the platform in the next five years

The announcement was made by chief content officer Theodore Sarandos in a conference in New York earlier this week.

He was reported as saying, by Seeking Alpha, that Netflix wants to expand its original programming to ‘as many as 20 original series’.

This is apparently a move to try and replicate the success of channels such as HBO.

Mr Sarandos said the idea was to launch an ‘original season of content every two and a half weeks’ to get into a ‘regular drumbeat with consumer expectation.’

Earlier this year Netflix agreed to pay Verizon to ensure its video streams receive priority over the ISPs network.

It comes amid growing concern over ISPs plans to throttle high-bandwidth services such as Netflix - and claims from Netflix boss Reed Hastings that payments are an 'arbitrary tax'.

The deal came just weeks after a similar agreement with Comcast was revealed.

But it quickly paid off for Comcast subscribers, and figures showed Netflix's videos streamed through Comcast's Internet service at their highest speeds in 17 months.

He continued that this doesn’t necessarily mean a new show for everybody, but rather new shows for different ‘segments of the viewership every couple of weeks.’

Netflix is also planning to release more original movies, which include a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon next year - subtitled ‘The Green Destiny’.

The move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo is also making its own original TV shows.

The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices.

The series, which launch in 2016, will be available free to be viewers.

And beginning in the summer of 2015, Yahoo is also planning to stream one live concert every day through a partnership with Live Nation.

The expansion makes Yahoo one of the latest technology companies to mount a challenge to Netflix.

Microsoft, Amazon, Hulu and Wuaki are among the other companies angling for a piece of the growing audience watching video piped over high-speed internet connections.

The shows will cater to a variety of tastes, with new shows being shown every two weeks. They will complement the site's existing original series like House of Cards (shown), which stars Kevin Spacey. Netflix is also planning original movies including a Crouching Tiger sequel

Netflix’s move follows news earlier in the year that Yahoo will also release its own original TV shows in 2016 (chief executive Marissa Mayer shown). The first of these will be comedies titled Other Space and Sin City Saints, and they will be shown on the Yahoo website, mobile app, Apple TV and Roku devices
