Volvo has launched a revolutionary safety device that scans for cyclists and automatically brakes if a collision is imminent.

The Swedish car firm says the camera and radar-guided technology, which is being introduced into cars from May, could save  hundreds of lives.

The system comprises a radar scanner in the grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and an onboard computer. It allows the car to identify cyclists who swerve into its path and reacts by slamming on the brakes.

How it works: The camera and radar combine to identify and differentiate between pedestrians and cyclists

Radar: Computers calculate any possible collision and - if the driver ignores initial warnings - apply the brakes

The driver is given a loud audible warning and a visible warning of a row of red lights flashing up on the windscreen.

This is how Volvo's amazing new technology works:

The new cyclist detector system comprises a radar scanner set into the car’s grille, a camera fitted in front of the rear-view mirror, and a computerised central control unit.

The radar measures the distance to any suspicious object while the camera compares its shape and size against an electronic visual catalogue of thousands of images – including bicycles and cyclists. It can even differentiate between a pedal cyclist and a motor cyclist.

Volvo spokesman Duncan Forrester said: ’The high-resolution camera makes it possible to spot the moving pattern of pedestrians and cyclists.

‘The radar scans the area in front of the car. Once it has detected an object, the camera confirms that it is a vehicle, a bicycle or a pedestrian and it "keeps an eye" on the object.

‘If the situation becomes critical and in collision-course with the object a red warning flashes in the windscreen and the car activates full braking power automatically.’

The system is called ‘Cyclist Detection with full auto brake’ – but has already been dubbed ’cycle scan’ - and was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in Switzerland today.

Detection: Pedestrians, cyclists and parked vehicles are all recognisable to the car because it compares them to thousands of images stored on its computer hard-drive

Doug Speck, senior vice president of marketing, sales and customer service at Volvo Car Group, said it was ‘a major advance’ in road safety.

All Volvo cars equipped with pedestrian detection will now also be fitted with cyclist detection, he said.

Volvo cited accident data showing that around half of all cyclists killed in European traffic have collided with a car – a situation which the firm’s new technology aims to counter-act.

Volvo, which sold 40,000 new cars in the UK last year, said it will be available ’from Mid May in 2013’ in the Volvo V40, S60, V60, XC60, V70, XC70 and S80 models as part of a more general ‘driver support’ safety package costing £800.

A Volvo spokesman said the system was designed to deal with scenarios such as ‘a cyclist in the same lane swerving out in front of the car’, someone wobbling and not paying attention, or taking evasive action to avoid a pot-hole.

Safety: The package will be available in models including the V60 from May

Volvo stressed that the automatic brakes kick in only ‘as a last resort’ and that the driver otherwise retains ultimate control of the car and brakes.

Deaths and serious injuries among cyclists, children and pedestrians have soared on Britain’s roads amid a summer of sporting spectaculars, school holidays and unseasonal wet weather.

Road safety experts say the Olympics and a ‘Bradley Wiggins’ effect may have contributed to an alarming rise in child pedestrian and cyclist casualties last summer as youngsters sought to emulate their sporting heroes.

Last year, 122 cyclists were killed on British roads - the highest toll for five years.

Previous studies have found that the number of cyclists killed rises during recessions as more people take to their bikes to save money on running a car.
