Howard Stern today shared his relief as his long-term radio show co-host Robin Quivers returned to the studio after beating cancer.

Quivers, Stern's on-air partner of 30 years, had been taking part in The Howard Stern Show from her New York City home for the past 17 months, but she is now healthy enough to return to the studio.

Stern - who once said he would quit his show if he lost his sidekick - told her: 'Never get sick again.'

'Seriously, I've been praying for this day,' he added. 'And I'm really happy that you are here.'

Back to work: Radio co-host Robin Quivers has returned to the studio for The Howard Stern show after broadcasting for 17 months from home as she underwent treatment for cancer

Relief: Stern gave her a heartfelt welcome, saying he had not thought the day would ever come

'I
was very very depressed over your illness. I wasn't sure what the 
outcome was going to be. There was a time I really did think I was going
to lose you permanently.

'And I'll tell you what, this is a pretty 
remakable day that you are here triumphant and cured. I never would have
predicted this. Honestly.'

Quivers, 61, had announced in May 2012 that she needed surgery to remove a tumor from her bladder - and doctors discovered a 
lump the size of a grapefruit in her pelvis.

The cancerous mass had developed from endometrial tissue, which is found in the uterus.

But last month, she revealed that she had been cured after surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

In Septemeber, Stern said
he had been 'freaking out' when Robin went under the knife for the 
eight-hour op to remove the lump saying, 'It was just a f**king crazy 
thing that came out of left field.'

'Robin means more to me than anything,' Howard said. 'Seeing her go through this just f**king tore me up.'

The feisty news reader has become indispensable to Stern over the years.

In 2012, when Robin's doctors first found the mass, Stern said on-air: 'I'll f***ing kill you if you have cancer. I'm 
not doing the show without youâ€¦ I'm quitting if you're not doing the 
show.'
