Rupert Murdoch's children are turning on each other over the phone hacking scandal engulfing his media empire, it was claimed today.

His daughter Elizabeth said her brother had f***** the company', according to Michael Wolff, a biographer of the billionaire tycoon.

Mr Wolff claimed the simmering family tensions exploded into the open at a book launch last Sunday for political analyst Philip Gould.

It was hosted by her husband, public relations guru Matthew Freud, and Times editor, James Harding.

Miss Murdoch, 42, has denied she had said something similar about ousted News International chief executive and her father's favourite, Rebekah Brooks.

But Wolff claimed on Twitter that those reports were 'incomplete', Tweeting: 'She said: "James and Rebekah f***** the company.'"'

Miss Murdoch is understood to be 'furious' by the meltdown of her father's worldwide empire.

The crisis has led to the closure of the News of the World, the resignations of Ms Brooks, the arrest of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and the launch of an FBI investigation in America into alleged hacking of 9/11 victims.

On Friday, loyal Dow Jones chief executive Les Hinton, who had worked for Rupert Murdoch for 52 years, resigned and now scrutiny is resting on her brother James.

Wolff, a long-time critic of the deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, told the Observer: 'What we are seeing is an enormous amount of frustration.

'James absolutely cannot survive. Whether or not he is legally culpable, he certainly mishandled this entire situation and has done for a long period of time.'

Wolff believes he will 'go into some form of exile' and his father will be eased out of the company.

Wolff added: 'Rupert will be put out to pasture and an outsider not named Murdoch will be put in charge.'

It was reported that the Murdoch family have been having regular quarterly summits to discuss the future of the company- the last one held in Australia.

James Murdoch, heir to the media dynasty, has admitted that he misled 
Parliament over the hacking scandal at the News of the World.

He had wrongly maintained' it 
was carried out by just one reporter, and said it was 'a matter of 
serious regret' that he had approved out-of-court settlements with victims without knowing the full facts.

On Tuesday, he will be placed under further 
pressure when the parliamentary culture, media and sport committee quizzes him, his father and Rebekah Brooks about the scandal.

It will demand he name those within 
News International's headquarters in Wapping, east London, whom he has publicly referred to as 'wrongdoers' who 'turned a good newsroom bad'.

Executives have appeared before the committee in the past, insisting there was no widespread phone hacking at the paper.

They included Mr Hinton, former News of the World editor Andy Coulson, then managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International senior lawyer Tom Crone.
