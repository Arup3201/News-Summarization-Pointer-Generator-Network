Just as you <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LJlbDBJmavE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>thought enthusiasm over Disney's Frozen was about to thaw, the company has announced the phenomenon is to be turned into a live show, performed fittingly, on-ice.

The film is to be re-imagined for a touring show set to open in the US this September.

Frozen is sixth biggest box office hit in the history of cinema, with approximately $1.3bn in worldwide box office sales.

Let it go! Disney will expand the reach of Frozen, the highest-grossing animated picture of all time, by bringing it to ice. The film is to be reimagined for a touring show set to open in this September

The action adventure involves 
Princess Anna teaming up with co-stars Sven the reindeer and Olaf the 
snowman to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have 
inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.

The arena tour which will travel throughout the U.S. in 2014 and 2015, will begin at the home of Disney in Orlando.

The show, produced by Feld Entertaiment, will mark the first time the characters of sisters Anna and Elsa will be appearing in a live production.

The plot will closely follow the magical story that is portrayed in the film, set in the Kingdom of Arendelle.

The experience won't be short on special effects either with the producers simulating a blizzard created by 20 snow machines, a stage inspired by a six-sided snowflake and towering video projection panels that will recreate the movie’s jagged North Mountains.

There will also be live performances of the soundtrack's greatest hits, including Let It Go.

The show will be hosted by Mickey and Minnie Mouse, with guest appearances by other Disney princesses and characters from Toy Story, Finding Nemo and The Lion King, the company said.

The tour will also have six different versions trekking through the country between 2014 and 2015, with nine traveling overseas.

After opening in Orlando, the Frozen tour will travel to cities including Tampa, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Newark, New Jersey. The show will have several performances in New York at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn in November.

The 'immersive experience' will include a set that incorporates not only the ice surface, but the air above it, with snow machines, video projections and other special effects and a large cast of ice skaters.

'Our goal is to showcase these heartwarming characters in a way that allows the audience to cheer and sing along throughout this emotional journey,' director Patty Vincent said.

Disney on Ice shows are usually made up of short segments from various Disney films.

However, because Frozen's story already involves ice, the show will be 98 per cent based on Elsa and her princess sister, Anna and their pals.

Disney has been moving quickly to capitalize on the massive success of Frozen, which won two Academy Awards and has taken in more than $1.2 billion worldwide since its release in November.

The soundtrack has sold more than 2.7 million copies in the United States alone, and DVD and digital download sales have been among the best Hollywood has ever seen.

Despite a lukewarm critical response,
 the film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert 
Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for 
13 consecutive weeks.

There has 
also been a huge demand for toys and costumes associated with the film 
such as Elsa's shimmering blue dress or Anna's caped ensemble.

Demand
 became so high both sides of the Atlantic that Disney started selling 
out as stock ran low and even had to impose quotas on some of the 
merchandise to create an 'equitable way' to buy the most popular stuffed
 animals and dolls.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that a live Broadway musical version is currently in production alongside concepts for theme park rides.

'This is definitely up there in terms of our top, probably, five franchises,' Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told analysts in response to questions about how long Frozen fever could last.

'So you can expect us to take full advantage of that over the next five years, I would guess,' he said.
