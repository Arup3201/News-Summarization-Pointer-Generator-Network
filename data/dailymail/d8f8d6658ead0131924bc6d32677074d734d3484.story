A Yazidi girl who was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by Islamic State militants has told of her terrifying ordeal and escape.

Besma (a pseudonym) was used as a sex slave by extremists - and agreed to speak on the condition her identity was not revealed. 

The 15-year-old, was kept in a village near the spot she had been taken from and repeatedly raped, but one day, took her chance to flee along with another captive.

Besma, speaking under a pseudonym, has told of her terrifying ordeal at the hands of Islamic State before she manged to flee. Pictured, Yazidi refugees at the Hanke camp near Dohuk, Iraq

She, along with two others, has been taken in by a family, in Dohuk, Iraq.

Erivan Mehdi, whose family is caring for the girls, told Al-monitor.com: 'They cry a lot, and they are often lost in their own thoughts.' 

Besma had been in Sinjar when ISIS overran the area in August last year - and shot dead one of her brothers.

Her father had disappeared on the road to Mosul nine years earlier in the midst of war in Irag.

During the attack, she said her family had pleaded with their Sunni Arab neighbours for help, but were turned over to ISIS.

The militants took Besma, her mother and surviving brother along with around 500 other Yazidi residents in the area. 

They were loaded onto buses and taken to Tal Afar, where they were kept for two days and fed eggs, cucumbers and tomatoes. At that point, she added they were not mistreated.

But then, Yazidi men were separated from the group - and Besma, her mother and brother were taken to a prison, which one woman identified as Badush, located northwest of Mosul.

She recalled breakfast at 9am, followed by lunch, which was usually cucumbers and tomatoes. Captives were given dinner of bread and grapes after midnight. 

One night, as airstrikes targeted the area near the prison, she said: 'Everyone was crying and asking God to finish us off at once, rather than endure the terror,' she said.

Young, pretty girls were taken from their mothers by the militants. The rest were forced to convert to Islam and pray. 

Besma was taken to Mosul, where she was eventually separated from her mother and brother and moved to the town of Baaj, near the Syrian border.

She was with around 100 other girls, who had been picked out by ISIS members. Along with five others, she was then taken to the village of Rambusi, near Sinjar.

At night in the village, members took turns 'bringing the girls back to their residence' - Besma's euphemism for being raped. 

And she remembers the names of three members who systematically raped the girls: Abu Hussein, Abu Ali and Abu Abdullah (who was known as Abu Shadad).

Two weeks after Besma arrived in Rambusi, 15 militants, including her captors, met in a house on the edge of the village. 

Besma and another girl, Berivan, decided to take their chance to escape. 

She said: 'We served them okra stew and rice, and all of them sat down to eat,' Besma

While the men ate, Besma and Berivan, 18, took a Samsung mobile phone that one of the fighters had left to charge and fled.

Berivan called her brother to ask for his help and over the next two days, Berivan's brother and other Yazidi fighters guided the two to safety.

She remembers one ISIS member Abu Sarhan, who had repeatedly raped Berivan, calling the phone the girls had stolen - and warning them they would soon be caught.

Terrified, they switched the phone off and carried on.

The pair kept going until they reached Mount Sinjar, where several Yazidi fighters received them. 

One of the men, Khero, told Al-Monitor, of the moment he saw the two exhausted girls walking up the mountain in September last year.

Although now safe, Besma and Berivan continue to live in fear - with Besma's mother and brother still captive. 

Besma spends her days watching videos released by ISIS and crying looking at photographs of her two missing brothers.

Another Yazidi girl, Ibtisam, was taken from Tel Qasab, a village near Sinjar, along with her mother and three younger sisters, was freed after five months in captivity.

The 15-year-old and 200 other Yazidi slaves - most of them elderly, sick or disabled - were freed last week but her mother and sisters remain captive. 

Islamic State released about 200 Yazidis held for five months in Iraq, mostly elderly, infirm captives, who likely slowed the extremists down, Kurdish military officials said on Sunday

Ibtisam and the others who were released are now in Lalish, site of the holiest shrine for Yazidis.

When Islamic State militants ordered them onto buses early on Saturday, the Yazidis thought they were being led to their execution. 

Instead, they were dropped off at a bridge crossing into Kurdish-controlled territory. 

But asked why she thinks she was released while they were kept, the embarrassed girl said: 'They were more attractive'. 

ISIS consider the sect to be devil worshippers and unlike Christianity and Judaism, the Yazidi religion is not acknowledged in the Koran.

The majority of the Yazidi community have been made homeless by ISIS, with hundreds massacred and thousands in captivity.

Kurdish peshmerga forces drove back Islamic State militants in northwestern Iraq last month, breaking a long siege of Sinjar mountain where thousands of Yazidis had been stranded for months - but many Yazidi villages remain under IS control.
