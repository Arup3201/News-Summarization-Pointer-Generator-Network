A mother of four who lost her feet and part of her legs after being trapped in the wreckage of her mangled car for six days has spoken about her harrowing ordeal and how she never gave up hope that someone would find her.

Doctors believe Kristin Hopkins, 44, was just eight hours from death when she was finally found on May 4 by two passing motorists.

Hopkins endured six days trapped in the wreckage of her vehicle 140 feet down a remote Colorado ravine off Highway 285.

Kristin Hopkins, 44, lost her feet and part of her legs after being trapped in the wreckage of her mangled car for six days after her vehicle fell 140 feet down a remote Colorado ravine off Highway 285

Speaking for the first time about her horrifying ordeal, Hopkins said her first thoughts after her accident were for her four children.

‘The first thing that came to my mind was, "Oh my God, I have to go pick up my kids, it's a school day. It's Monday, it's my day to pick up the kids,'" she told Good Morning America.

The crash happened on April 27 sometime after Hopkins had left work, but her first memory was waking up the next day, upside down.

‘It was daylight and I wasn't in my seatbelt. [I] was lying on the roof of the car because the car had flipped. I had no idea where I was, what happened or anything.’

Hopkins quickly realized she was trapped without access to food, water or her cell phone.

‘[I] tried to go out frontwards. I couldn't get out that way and then I was exhausted [and] took a little nap,’ she said. ‘Then I mustered the energy and tried to go out backwards and couldn't get out that way and kind of took another little nap.’

As Hopkins drifted in and out of consciousness, she can recall only fleeting moments of the more than 100 hours she spent trapped in the wreckage.

At one point she found her red and white umbrella and scribbled messages on it with a Sharpie she found in her purse.

On the white panels of the umbrella she wrote: ‘Thirsty + hungry … Six days no food or water … Please help. Can't get doors open … Need doctor. Hurt and bleeding.’

After six days stuck inside the wreckage of her vehicle, Hopkins was rushed to hospital in a critical condition to undergo double amputation surgery

‘The one door I could open this much, I got the umbrella out and I opened it and it stayed there. …I don't remember what day that was,’ she said.

Even as the days went by, Hopkins she didn't give up. ‘I never had that death thought in my head,’ she told KUSA. ‘It was more or less ... “when will somebody find me?'"

‘I'm a mom, I had kids to worry about, kids to take care of. I had to keep going because they needed a mom. I couldn't leave my kids.’

She was finally discovered on May 4 by a couple who stopped after noticing some glare from the crashed vehicle, they never expected the car's passenger to still be alive.

In a critical condition, Hopkins was rushed to hospital to undergo double amputation surgery from which she is continuing to improve.

Cry for help: At one point Hopkins found her red and white umbrella and scribbled messages on it with a Sharpie to try and attract attention

‘The first time I went from the bed to the wheelchair, I sat there and cried because I was like, “Oh dear God, this is going to be hard,”’ she said.

Then, Hopkins said, she drew upon the reserves of strength and determination that had got her through her ordeal. She told herself: ‘Get over it, because this is your life...’

She is now focused on battling through painful physical therapy sessions. She started rehabilitation on Friday and will be fitted for prosthetics in a few weeks.
