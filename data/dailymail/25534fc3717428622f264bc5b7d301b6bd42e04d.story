Two young Christian brothers in Egypt accused of tearing up a copy of the Koran and urinating on it have been placed in juvenile detention and charged with blasphemy, it has emerged.

Mina Nadi, 9, and Nabil Nadi, 10, were detained on 
Tuesday after residents in the village of Marco, in the province of Beni Suef, south of Cairo, filed complaints about their alleged behaviour.

Tensions between Muslims and Christians in Egypt have increased recently following a series of  incidents involving 
religious insults.

Held: Two Christian brothers in Egypt accused of tearing up a copy of the Koran and urinating on it have been placed in juvenile detention and charged with blasphemy. Religious tensions in Egypt have increased recently - riot police are pictured last month

This includes protests last month over a film made in 
California which mocked the Prophet Mohammad.

Residents of the village said a passerby had seen the children ripping up pages of a copy of the  Koran and urinating on it in front of the local mosque on Monday.

The
passerby took the two boys to the local priest to condemn them for the 
incident, the residents said, but he was not satisfied with what he 
viewed as the priest's insufficient reprimand and decided to file a 
complaint to the police.

It is not known why the children had allegedly desecrated the  Koran , but some residents said the boys were playing and were not incited by anyone to conduct the act.

Villagers said that prosecutors had ordered that the boys be detained for seven days pending an investigation.

Security was stepped up around the village on Tuesday to prevent a potential flare-up of sectarian violence after a group of Muslims gathered around the police station where the children were being held to demand their prosecution, residents said.

Around 10 per cent of Egypt's 83 million people are Christian, many of whom have been concerned about the political rise of Islamists after a popular uprising ousted Hosni Mubarak last year.

Speaking to Daily News Egypt, Ishak Ibrahim, a researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights said the children denied the incident and one of them is illiterate.

He also said there had been a recent increase in blasphemy charges .

'These incidents are on the rise and we 
are seeing an increase in contempt of religion cases and unfortunately 
most of the cases end up with jail sentences,' he said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
