Rockne Newell, 60, has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility for the right to less starchy prison food 

A man jailed for killing three people at a town planning meeting in Pennsylvania is suing for the right to less starchy prison food.

Rockne Newell, 60, has filed a federal lawsuit against Monroe County Correctional Facility, alleging he has been subjected to cruel treatment because his special dietary requests have been ignored.

His attorneys claim the prison's high-starch meals trigger erratic mood and energy swings, which could endanger Newell's long-term health. 

They say that he'd be better off with the kosher meals Jewish inmates receive.

Apparently Newell's attempts to purchase healthier options have been hindered by commissary spending limits.

According to the Scranton Times-Tribune, his lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order for him to be provided with foods not harmful to his welfare.

Newell has been held without bail since August 5, 2013, when he was charged with three counts of homicide following a shooting spree at the Ross Township supervisors' meeting that night.

Monroe County District Attorney David Christine intends to seek the death penalty for Newell, who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. 

Prosecutors have said the junk dealer was upset over the loss of his debris-strewn property after a lengthy court fight with the township.

The township had acted on complaints that he lived in a storage shed, built an illegal culvert and used a bucket outside as a toilet.

The township supervisors were about 15 minutes into their public meeting on the first Monday in August when things reportedly went 'terribly awry.'

Killed were Gerard Kozic, 53, David Fleetwood,62, and James V. LaGuardia, 64.

Three other people were injured before Newell was restrained by Bernard Kozen, the township's parks director.

Township solicitor John Dunn, who was one of Newell's alleged targets but escaped injury, testified at the suspect's preliminary hearing.

Newell has since said he regrets that 'innocent people got hurt' in the shooting.
