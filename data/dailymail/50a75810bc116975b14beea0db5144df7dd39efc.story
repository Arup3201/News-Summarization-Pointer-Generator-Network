Seven cases of meningitis occurred recently on Princeton University's college campus in New Jersey.

School Officials are meeting with the trustees this weekend to discuss whether or not to administer students a vaccination. The vaccination in question is the only Meningococcal that prevents against meningitis group B.

The Novartis manufactured vaccination called, Bexsero, may be used in Europe and Australia but has not yet been approved in the United States. 

Princeton will decide whether or not to administer students a meningitis vaccination that has not yet been approved in the United States

Elizabeth powers, a spokesperson for Novartis said they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and the state Department of Public Health in order to get a vaccine for the school.

'We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities,' Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN.

Martin Mbuga, a spokesman for the Ivy League School, said that the school is working to eradicate the problem as safely as possible. 

Bexsero is the only vaccine that prevents against the rare type of meningitis B that already infected seven people, one of whom is still hospitalized

The school has been telling students to keep washing their hands, not to share drinks, and to always cover their coughs, reported USA Today.

Group B meningitis is a bacterial strain that causes symptoms such as fever, vomiting, stiff neck, headache, confusion, and sensitivity to light. It is characterized as a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

If left untreated it can cause permanent brain damage, hearing loss, and lead to limb amputations and death. It can be treated with antibiotics. 

The type of meningitis spreading over the campus is a very rare form that usually only affects children.

A professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, William Schaffner, told USA Today that 'Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C," he said. 'This is very, very unusual.'

CNN reported that the first case occurred after a student returned to Campus in March after Spring recess. Two months later, six more students and a visitor contracted the disease. Most of the students recovered except for one student who is currently hospitalized after being diagnosed on Nov.8.

The Mail Online got the chance to speak to Dr. Daryl Isaacs, an expert in preventative medicine, clinical diagnosis, and travel medicine. He is currently on staff at New York University School of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, and New York Downtown Hospital.

He was also featured as the doctor in the popular film, 'SuperSize Me.' 

Meningitis is spread by exchanging saliva, sharing drinks, or other respiratory secretions

He told the Mail Online, 'All students should get vaccinated before going to college.'

'It's a disease caused by overcrowding,' he said. 'It spreads anywhere there are people such as in dormitories, cafeterias, and prisons.'

He also emphasized the dangers of the disease and called it, 'rapidly spreading and highly fatal.'

As for whether or not the school should administer the vaccination to its students, he said 'absolutely.'

He said most college students are required to be vaccinated before arriving on campus and if students opt out of the meningitis vaccination then they must sign a waiver.

He described the outbreak as 'strange' and attributed it to the fact that the vaccinations students are currently required to receive are 'very effective' but may not prevent this rare form.

If the board decides to distribute the vaccine, 8,000 students could be offered the preventative measure.
