The list of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's sexual harassment victims just keeps getting longer and lewder.

Not only did he inappropriately interact with a mayoral staffer, campaign volunteer and constituent - it seems the mayor targeted female veterans who had been raped while in the military.

At least eight female military veterans are among the total 13 women who have come forward to claim that the San Diego mayor sexually harassed them, from hitting on them to groping.

Two of the veterans, Eldonna Fernandez and Gerri Tindley, shared their stories of the predatory Filner with CNN Wednesday.

These new accusations come after the San Diego mayor was asked to resign by long-time supporters after several credible sources came forward saying Filner sexually harassed them. 

But Filner refused to resign, and took a two-week leave of absence Monday to attend therapy instead. 

Eldonna Fernandez met Filner at a National Women's Veterans Association of America 'Healing and Hiring Fair' when he was still a U.S. Congressman serving as chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs

Ms Fernandez, a retired master sergeant from the Air Force, had served 23 years in the military and says she was raped three times during her service.

She never reported her rapes because she believed the system would not support her.

Now she speaks about her abuse and is an active member of the NWVAA.

At the fair, Ms Fernandez exchanged business cards with Filner at the event, and very quickly he asked her if she was married.

'You're beautiful, and I can't take my eyes off you, and I want to take you to dinner,' she recalls him saying.

She said OK and later received a 'creepy' phone call from the congressman.

'Hi, it's your newly favorite congressman, Bob Filner. You know, the one who fell in love with you at your last speech.'

He proceeded to ask Ms Fernandez to dinner, but she never called him back.

Not leaving: Despite being asked to resign by his own supporters, Filner announced at a press conference July 26 that he was taking a two-week leave of absence to go to therapy

Gerri Tindley, another veteran, was at the same event when Filner made inappropriate advances on her.

The two were both scheduled to speak at the event and met in the green room.

Ms Tindley was going to speak about the violent rape she experienced during her eight years in the service, and the son she had from the assault.

Filner asked about the rape, and then attempted to 'comfort' her by getting as close as he could on the couch and rubbing her 'like he cared.'

Ms Tindley was so uncomfortable with Filner's touches that she almost fell off the couch trying to put space between the two of them.

Tara Jones, president of the NWVAA says she has spoken to seven to eight women with different encounters of sexual assault by Filner.

Victim: Fernandez thought she deleted her voicemail from Filner but rediscovered it in the trash section of her phone when allegations that the mayor committed acts of sexual harassment came out

'He went to dinners, asked women out to dinners, grabbed breasts, buttocks. The full gamut. Everything that is complete violation of what we stand for,' Jones told CNN. 'He's a sexual predator. And he used this organization for his own personal agenda.'

Ms Jones believes the other military veterans, most of them abuse victims, were targeted because of their past.

'He preyed upon people who were vulnerable, who he knew nine times out of 10 would not speak up,' she said.

But they did speak up, and now they are angry.

'He's part of an organization that's against sexual assault and sexual violence against women and sexual harassment and he's doing the very thing that we are fighting to make stop in our service and in our country,' Ms Fernandez said.

'He didn't have our backs, he was looking at our backs.'
