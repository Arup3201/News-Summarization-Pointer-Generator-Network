Senior Lib Dems have privately warned Nick Clegg will only be able to stay on as leader if he wins more than 45 MPs at the election.

If the party falls below this threshold it will be too small to enter into Coalition with Labour or the Tories, MPs believe, leaving Mr Clegg’s position as party leader untenable.

The Deputy Prime Minister is expected to ‘fall on his sword’ if he cannot lead the party back into Government after the election.

But if he manages to limit Lib Dem losses to single figures he is almost certain to win a vote of the Parliamentary party to allow him to form another Coalition.

One senior MP told MailOnline: ‘At some point it just becomes a matter of numbers.

‘You have to fill Cabinet positions, junior ministerial positions, select committee chairs – things like that – while also having places for MPs sulking or who don’t want to sit in Government.

‘It’s also about balance. You can’t have one massive party and one tiny party with little or no say.

‘If we do go into another Coalition then Nick will stay on as leader – he will have to. If we don’t, then the parliamentary party will have to talk about what we do. But will Nick want to stay? He will fall on his sword, is my guess.’

It comes amid revelations that Mr Clegg has given up on the idea of stopping Lib Dem president Tim Farron from taking over as leader if he is ousted after the election.

The Deputy Prime Minister and his supporters had hoped that a leading contender on the right of the party like Danny Alexander could mount a challenge.

But allies of Mr Clegg have told MailOnline that left-winger Mr Farron is 'unstoppable', and could mount a challenge even if the Lib Dems are returned to government in a new coalition.

Some opinion polls put the Lib Dems behind both Ukip and the Greens, with experts predicting the party could lose up to half of its 57 MPs in May.

Mr Clegg has vowed to lead his party into the election, and will refuse to step down if he gets the Lib Dems back into government, regardless of how few of his MPs survive.

Party sources suggest he could even cling on for several months if the Tories or Labour can take power without the Lib Dems for a 'transitional period'.

But hopes of a Lib Dem minister mounting a challenge against Mr Farron are fading fast.

'Tim is unstoppable now,' said one senior Lib Dem source. 'He is a relentless campaigning politician.

'He replies to every tweet, he speaks to every councillor, he turns up to every dinner. He's got the time because he has never had to run a department.'

Mr Farron has previously been dismissed by some in his party as a 'cheeky chappie telling jokes about Margaret Thatcher and the miners'.

But he is understood to have built huge grassroots support, unencumbered by taking difficult decisions in coalition.

Supporters of Mr Clegg insist that if he gets the Lib Dems back into a coalition after the election, his position is safe.

'He will be able to go on and on,' said on MP. 'But that doesn't mean Tim won't try to find a way to position himself as a leader in the wings.'

Mr Clegg had hoped that his close friend Mr Alexander would have been able to succeed him as leader, to prove the party was serious about being a force in government.

Allies saw Mr Alexander as the standard-bearer of the 'responsible' wing of the party.

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has been considered to be 'on manoeuvres' for the last 12 months, raising his personal profile and distancing himself from Tory George Osborne.

But he has a huge struggle to cling on to his own seat in the Scottish highlands, and has been tarnished in the eyes of many Lib Dem activists by his close association with Tory austerity.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey has already thrown his hat into the ring, declaring his willingness to lead the party if it 'falls' to him.

He said it was 'not unreasonable' that he and others wold launch a challenge 'when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs as leader'.

He added: 'If one day it falls to me to lead it, then obviously, I'd like to do that.'

But he faces a strong challenge from the Tories in his seat, and has failed to impress some of his colleagues. 'If Ed Davey didn't exist as a politician, no-one would invent him,' said one Lib Dem MP.

Health minister Norman Lamb is also being urged by colleagues to prepare a leadership bid, but he and his wife are reluctant to embrace the degree of exposure the job would involve.

If Mr Clegg is forced out, there is some doubt about who will be in charge in his absence.

Sir Malcolm Bruce, the party's deputy leader, is standing down at the election so would not be in the Commons.

Vince Cable, who was caretaker leader before Mr Clegg took over, was once tipped as a successor.

Health minister Norman Lamb is being urged to prepare a leadership bid, while Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said he would be interested in the job when Nick Clegg 'hangs up his clogs'

But his leadership chances suffered a fatal blow when his old friend Lord Oakeshott carried out polling designed to undermine Mr Clegg.

Mr Cable denies having any knowledge of the plot, and friends say he has not spoken to Lord Oakeshott since. 

In a fresh setback, Mr Clegg sacked Mr Cable as the party's economic spokesman for the election campaign, handing the high profile role to Mr Alexander.

It means he will debate with Mr Osborne and Labour's Ed Balls, with Mr Cable on the sidelines.

Mr Clegg has refused to speculate on his future after the election, but insisted he had survived a barrage ofcriticism from all sides since entering coalition in May.

Earlier this month he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'Look I've tried to deal, with as much good grace as I can muster, all the criticism I get day in/day out, left, right and centre.

'It is unsurprising - if it wasn't me, whoever would be leader of the party - that you get that kind of incoming flack because what we're doing is deeply unsettling to the vested interests on right and left in British politics.'
