Two women have been found dead in the home they shared, triggering a major police investigation.

The women, named locally as Rachel Clayton, 34, and her girlfriend Emma Speed, 30, were discovered at their terraced house in Macclesfield on Sunday night.

The deaths are being treated as 'unexplained', but Cheshire Police have confirmed that nobody else is wanted in connection with the incident.

Post mortem examinations were due to take place this morning.

Neighbours said emergency services and gas engineers from National Grid were called to the property in Crompton Road at around 8.45pm on Sunday night.

No gas was found to be escaping after tests of the gas supply inside and outside the property.

The tragedy emerged on Sunday night after Ms Clayton had returned home on three weeks of leave from her job as a chef in the canteen of a North Sea oil rig.

Emma Speed, 30, was found dead at a house in Macclesfield on Sunday. It is thought that she recently moved in

She had just bought a new VW Scirocco car and was proudly showing it off to friends on Facebook.

The 34-year-old had joked about the forthcoming Manchester derby in messages on the site, and in a recent message said of her imminent holiday: 'Home tomoz thank didily I'm becoming a recluse after 3 weeks in the North Sea'. Her last message was posted on April 5.

Neighbour Anne-Marie Pearson said: 'There were lots of police, an ambulance and fire engine.

'The road was blocked off at either end to stop traffic getting in and out. An officer was walking door to door asking everyone to stay inside.'

April Bennett, 28, who lives nearby with her nine-month-old son Leo, added: 'It was scary because of the amount of police about. We were told to stay in doors and were asked if we had seen anything suspicious.

'Having no idea what had happened was terrifying, especially with such a young baby in the house.'

It is understood the bodies were found by a man known to both women who had a spare key to house.

Forensic officers spent most of yesterday at the house.

Ms Clayton is believed to have lived at the house for several years and Ms Speed is understood to have moved in recently.

Ms Clayton's parents Malcolm and Susan, of Poynton, were last night too upset to talk.

Neighbour Jennifer Hurst, 32, of Crompton Road, said: 'I knew Rachel to say hello to every now and again and she just seemed like a very happy, cheerful person. It's so sad.

'She bought the house a few years ago and seemed to be doing a lot of work to it so you'd see her popping in and out. She seemed to keep herself to herself but seemed very pleasant as well.

'I think everyone's just in a bit of a state of disbelief. There was a lot of commotion at the time but we never thought it would be something as tragic as this.'

Sue Taylor, who runs the Bargain Booze store on nearby Chester Road, said Ms Clayton was a regular customer at the store.

She said: 'She was a lovely girl, very bubbly and nice to talk to. We were talking about her work on the rigs last week. She described it as hard work and very cold, especially recently. It is so sad.'
