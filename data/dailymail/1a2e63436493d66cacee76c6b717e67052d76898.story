Victor Carles Quiros, 24, died of 'multiple injuries' after being hit by a Tube train when he wandered on to the tracks while drunk

A City lawyer who was killed after walking out in front of a Tube train had drunk enough 'to cause a coma' on the night he died, an inquest has been told.

Victor Carles Quiros, 24, consumed four bottles of wine and half a bottle of whisky along with his cousin, Orlando Vasquesz, and two friends at a gathering in Kensington, West London.

An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court was told Mr Quiros went outside to get a phone signal, leaving his wallet, keys and coat in the flat.

He was next seen stumbling around Ladbroke Grove tube station after 5am. He walked through a gate on to the tracks and began walking towards Latimer Road, one stop away, the inquest heard.

He was hit by a Hammersmith and City line train travelling at around 40mph and died of 'multiple injuries' on April 12, the hearing was told. 

Mr Quiros had a blood alcohol content of between 200mg and 300mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, more than three times the legal drink drive limit, and a level where 'coma may occur'. 

A statement from Jason Archer, the train driver who last saw Mr Quiros alive, said: 'I was driving a Westbound Hammersmith and City train.

'As I emerged from this bend I was travelling at about 40mph when to my horror I saw a male person ahead of me.

“He never looked behind him, made no attempt to out of my way. I don’t know if he was aware of me. I was upon him in the blink of an eye. I heard a bang as I hit him.'

A prepared statement from Mr Vasquesz said: 'At around 4.30am he left my flat. When he left I didn’t pay attention to what he was doing.

'The fact is that when he left my flat he didn’t take with him his wallet, his keys and his coat...maybe he was disorientated and drunk.

'I am 100 per cent certain that Victor didn’t take his life on purpose. I knew him very well. We were cousins, family, like brothers.'

Steven Tucker, of British Transport Police, added: 'At 5.25am he can be just seen disappearing into the gloom towards Latimer Road. He looks unsteady. He looks drunk on CCTV.'

Mr Quiros drank four bottles of wine and half a bottle of whisky with his cousin, Orlando Vasquesz, and two friends. The inquest was told his blood alcohol content was high enough to cause a coma

Mr Quiros disappeared from his cousin's house at around 4.30am on April 12, and was next seen at Ladbroke Grove Tube station where he walked through a gate and on to the tracks

Coroner Doctor William Dolman said: 'My conclusion, one word now, would be accident.

'We have a 24-year-old lawyer from Panama who goes to his cousin’s for a sociable evening with friends, four people there.

'And, as Orlando Vasquesz has explained, they each drank a bottle of wine, and half a bottle of whisky between them.

'It was a convivial evening. There was nothing amiss with him. And Orlando suggests that he left the flat for the lack of mobile signal. He’s expected back there that night.

'No-one can answer for him, what he was doing on the line at that time. We can only assume that he would have been very drunk.' 

In a statement the international firm of lawyers where Mr Quiros worked said: 'All of us at Arias, Fabrega and Fabrega regret to announce with deep grief the unexpected death of our colleague.

'Victor Carles, resident attorney from our London office, unexpectedly passed away on April 12th. We remember our friend and associate with gratitude and great affection.

'To his family, friends and co-workers, we wish to express our condolences, love and everlasting admiration for a professional and outstanding extraordinary human being.

'This sad news is extended to all our valued friends, correspondents, colleagues and clients.'
