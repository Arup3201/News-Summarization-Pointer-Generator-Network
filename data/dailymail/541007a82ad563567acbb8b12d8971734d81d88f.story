New footage shows a beaming Rik Mayall lounging in an armchair and reciting Shakespeare's thoughts on death in what would become his last TV interview.

The comic star of Bottom and The Young Ones, who died  aged 56 in June, talked about his literary heroes just weeks before he suffered an 'acute cardiac event' returning from a morning run.

The interview came as he recited a cheeky 'bedtime story' for an adults' version of Jackanory, the famed BBC storytime show.

Depth: Rik Mayall's final screen interview shows the beaming star quoting Shakespeare's Macbeth on the futility of life. 'See, I mean he could write,' he said. 'He was a belter, old Shakey Bill. He could squeak a nib'

Anarchic: The appearance came decades after the late star prompted a storm of complaints with an animated reading of George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, on the children's TV show favourite Jackanory

His appearance would have come more than 20 years after he gave a memorably anarchic reading on Jackanory of George's Marvellous Medicine by Roald Dahl - prompting a storm of complaints to the BBC.

Mr Mayall, who appeared to be in perfect health until his death, sat in an armchair as he talked about his favourite storytellers and recited one of the most famous soliloquies from Macbeth.

'Storytelling has always been one of my great pleasures', he said.

'I'd love Shakey Bill to tell me a story, I mean, William Shakespeare, he could squeak a nib couldn't he?

'"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.

Quoting Act 5 of Shakespeare's Macbeth, the star says: 'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace to the last syllable of recorded time, and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death'

The death in June of the comedian (pictured right in The New Statesman) prompted an outpouring of tributes

'"Out, out brief candle. Life's but a passing shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his weary hour upon the stage and then, is heard no more.

'"It is a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."'

'See, I mean he could write, he was a belter, old Shakey Bill, he could squeak a nib.

'So imagine someone who could write as well as that saying: 'Good even Rik, I have a story to tell you. You'd go: 'Er, go on then. What? What?'

The passage recited by the comedian comes at the climax of Macbeth, as the traitor king of the title is surrounded by English troops and facing his own death.

In the original work, Shakespeare uses 'walking shadow' instead of Mayall's 'passing shadow', but the effect is the same. 

It is seen as the moment when he realises the futility of everything he has done in the play up to that point, including murdering the king and deceiving those closest to him. 

Mr Mayall's other favourite storytellers were more light-hearted.

'When I was young I saw some of my heroes doing it on the telly,' he said.

'We're talking about Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Arthur Lowe, Ian McKellan, Kenneth Williams. These were all guys telling stories to me.

'It's one of telly's great things. I personally like doing it too, I did Jackanory - I did Roald Dahl tale called George's Marvellous Medicine which there was a bit of a fuss about at the time.

'It was basically a story about a boy trying to poison his grandmother and I did it in kind of a lively way so there were complaints.

.I'd like to have [American horror actor] Vince Price read me a story. He's got such a lovely voice and such a great manner.

'I think [American horror author] HP Lovecraft is who I'd like to have read me a story as well, probably Marilyn of course, Kate Moss.'

The comedian's sudden death in June prompted an outpouring of tributes from colleagues and his wife Barbara, who thanked the press for 'all the wonderful coverage', adding: 'It would have made him very happy.'

She added: 'I am sure that you all know Rik's response would be something along the lines of....."well thanks very much all of you.............now f*** off!!!"'

Although not part of the show itself, the interview was carried out while filming an episode of Crackanory - an adults' version of the classic TV show Jackanory - which will air next week.

Tongue-in-cheek: The comedian read a story about a weather presenter who can control the elements

Starring alongside David Mitchell, Vic Reeves and Johnny Vegas, the comedian reads Tony Way's The Weather Man, a tongue-in-cheek story about a weather presenter who can control the elements but whose hero is Michael Fish.

Publicity producer Aidan Hackett, who interviewed him, said: 'He gave the best interview out of anyone we spoke to. He was really lovely - exactly how you would expect Rik to be.

'We had really good fun. He was taking the p*** out of us, but we were all having a laugh.'

The episode will be broadcast on Dave at 10pm on Wednesday, September 24.
