Many Premier League managers have grabbed the opportunity to spend the summer in warmer climes by heading to the World Cup in Brazil and scouting player ahead of the new season.

But Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has declined to head to the tournament, preferring instead to hang out with Stormtroopers at a promotional event.

It is not known if Rodgers is a fan of the Star Wars films but he will have plenty of time to watch them while away on Liverpool's pre-season tour of American which includes friendlies against Roma, Olympiacos, Manchester City and AC Milan before a game against Borussia Dortmund at Anfield.

That should help Liverpool prepare for a return to the Champions League and Rodgers will also hope to have added some strength in depth to his squad by then.

Liverpool have already signed striker Rickie Lambert from Southampton while a deal for Emre Can to join from Bayer Leverkusen has been agreed subject to documentation.

And 18-year-old MK Dons wonderkid Dele Alli could be set to follow suit in a transfer worth £3.5 million.
