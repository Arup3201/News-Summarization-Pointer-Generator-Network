Many musicians have trouble hitting the big notes but Hartmut Geilerthas more than a little help - by playing on the world's largest tuba.

The huge instrument is exactly double the dimensions in every respect to a normal tuba.

And at around eight feet tall, the giant Tuba towers over Geilerthas as he demonstrates how to play it.

Twenty local artisans  in Markneukirchen, Germany, crafted it in 2010 as part of celebrations around the town's 650th anniversary.

The tuba has been on display at the Musikinstrumenten-Museum but will soon travel to Frankfurt, where it will be displayed at the 2013 Music Trade Fair.

Markneukirchen has a rich tradition of brass and wood musical instrument manufacture dating back to the 17th century.
