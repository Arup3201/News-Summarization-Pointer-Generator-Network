More frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after five people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit.

The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit.

On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. 

Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back.

Australian farmers urge consumers to always buy homegrown products

'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said.

'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.'

The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria.

Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products.

Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world.

Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging. 

'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' 

He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked.

'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said.

'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.'

The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. 

Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past.

Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth.

'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday.

'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' 

NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks. 

Symptoms of Hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea and fever as well as yellow skin and eyes.

The outbreak comes as a number of Victorian hospitals are told to dispose of chocolate mousse, which has been found to contain listeria.

Hospitals are contacting patients who might have consumed the dessert between January 29 and February 10.

No cases of the illness have been reported and the product is not supplied to the general public.

The contamination came to light after the company conducted routine testing of its products.

Listeria is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, their unborn babies and the elderly.
