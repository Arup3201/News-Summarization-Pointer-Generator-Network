From a Renoir still life to evocative Monet landscapes, there are few paintings that artist Susie Ray cannot copy.

So similar to the originals are her works, even art experts have trouble telling the difference.

And while it might sound like an odd choice of career, according to Susie, demand for copies is soaring - not least from museums who use them when the original work is being cleaned or restored.

'I have been reproducing great master works to a very high standard throughout my career, and as a result it is quite difficult for the untrained eye to tell the difference,' explains Susie.

'Even experts have missed the fact that my painting was the copied version. My paintings have hung in galleries when the real painting was on loan, and people were none the wiser.'

So what makes a good copy? Susie, whose paintings sell for between £600 and £9,000 depending on the complexity of the work, says it's all about getting the style, technique and ageing spot on.

'Each painting is thoroughly researched,' she reveals. 'The correct size canvas has to be selected and primed, aged and executed in 
oil paint to ensure not only the look, but also the texture and feel of 
the painting, is as close to the original as possible.  

'The 
best copyist paintings are ones that have the same texture, colour and 
age as the original.

Many of Susie's works are copies of Impressionist paintings - a genre that has proved popular with clients.

The 19th century art movement originated in Paris during the 1870s and 1880s, in the face of opposition from the conventional art community who objected to the lack of sharp lines and contours, and artistic detail.

Instead, Impressionist works focus on recording a moment and are characterised by thin, visible brush strokes.

Among the most famous of the Impressionists are Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro.

'As a copyist, it is important I do not have a 
style of my own, as each painting must look like it is by the [original] artist.'

Despite the illegal-sounding nature of her business, Susie says everything is entirely above board and that clients know exactly what they're buying when they purchase one of her copies.

'Everything I do is completely within 
copyright law, and I would never pass off one of my paintings as the 
real deal,' she explains.

'I adhere strictly to copyright laws which permit copying 70 
years after the original artist has died, and more contemporary artists 
continue to come into circulation. This is why my work tends to focus on
the great masters.

'It
is up to the purchaser what they tell their friends [about] the painting. If they pass it off as the real deal then it is up to them and out 
of my control.'

Copyright concerns notwithstanding, Susie admits that the toughest part of recreating great art is accommodating idiosyncratic techniques.

'It
is often the simplest looking paintings that are the hardest to copy, 
as the dips and the quick brush strokes are harder to copy 
than the great masters,' she explains, adding that each work takes around three months to complete.

Favourite: Copies of Claude Monet's paintings, including this one, are especially popular with clients

Identical: Claude Monet's 1886 painting Storm on Belle-Isle is among Susie's portfolio of copies

'For example. Modigliani’s pen and ink sketches are very hard to copy due to the spontaneous approach of the drawing.'

So would she ever attempt an original work of her own? Surprisingly, Susie says she would never even consider it.

'No,' she says. 'I'm not a fine artist, and don't have a style of my own. Having said that, I 
do enjoy doing illustration and water colour from time to time and I 
also enjoy photography.'

It would seem there's no end to Susie Ray's artistic talents.
