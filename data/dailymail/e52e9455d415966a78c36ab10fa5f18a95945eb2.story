A 70-year-old former police officer has traced his ancestor’s roots to Barack Obama, Walt Disney and King Louis VI - on a family tree measuring 6ft.

David Sykes, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, got so carried away looking into where he came from that he has dedicated three decades to chronicling his family history.

The grandfather-of-three and father-of-two recorded more than 43,000 names adding to his paper tree until it became more than 6ft long and 2ft wide.

Research: David Sykes, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, got so carried away looking into where he came from that he has dedicated three decades to chronicling his family history

Magnified: He is working on his project for up to 14 hours a day at home, using online genealogy databases

Famous faces: Mr Sykes is related to US President Barack Obama (left) and actor Brad Pitt (right) - who are both his 23rd cousin four times removed

On the screen: Actresses Brooke Shields (24th cousin three times removed, left) and Marilyn Monroe (25th cousin one time removed, right) are also relations

Relation: Mr Sykes has forked out £200 to have his DNA mapped - and was told it reveals Thracian ancestry, the same tribe as the famous freedom fighter Spartacus (as portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film)

Among the famous figures he found a relation to was Sir Winston Churchill, who is his 23rd cousin.

Mr Sykes claims he is also related to US presidents Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and John Adams - and suspects it was one of his ancestors who fired the first shot in the American Civil War.

Washington was Mr Sykes's 18th cousin three times removed, Lincoln was his 23rd cousin three times removed, and Adams his 24th cousin three times removed.

His list also hosts of Hollywood celebrities in the tree, including Brad Pitt, Richard Gere, George Clooney, Brooke Shields and Marilyn Monroe.

Pitt is Mr Sykes's 23rd cousin four times removed, while Monroe is his 25th cousin one time removed. Clooney is even further away - being his 26th cousin two times removed.

Monarchs: King Louis VI 'The Fat' of France 
(left) is Mr Sykes's first cousin 27 times removed, while King Louis 
XVIII (right) is his 21st cousin six times removed

Politicians: Former British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill (23rd 
cousin, left) and former US president Abraham Lincoln (23rd cousins 
three times removed, right) are also in the tree

Other former US presidents: George Washington 
(18th cousin three times removed, left) and John Quincy Adams (24th 
cousin, three times removed)

Going back: Former US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt is Mr Sykes's 26th cousin one time removed

Big project: The grandfather-of-three and father-of-two recorded more than 43,000 names adding to his paper tree until it became more than 6ft long and 2ft wide

He is still working on his project for up to 14 hours a day at home, using online genealogy databases.

Mr Sykes said: ‘You expect to have a few connections to the past, but this is a historical timeline in its own right. It just keeps going on and on and on.

‘All I had of my father’s parents were two photos of their coffins being carried out of the house, I never knew them.

‘I wanted to know, what did they die of, is it something that could affect us in the future? My family can’t believe the findings I’ve produced - it takes time to convince them that it’s true.’

Mr Sykes has also forked out £200 to have his DNA mapped - and was told it reveals Thracian ancestry, the same tribe as the famous freedom fighter Spartacus.

The furthest back person on the list is King Fornjotur, the first king of Kveland - now an area of Scandinavia - who was born in 160AD. He is Mr Sykes’s great-grandfather 45 times.

The oldest relative he has traced his lineage back to is Beli The Great Mawr, an ancient figure in Welsh history and genealogy - sometimes even said to be a cousin of the Virgin Mary - who Mr Sykes claims as his great grandparent 74 times.

Nick Kingsley, head of archives sector development at the National Archives, said: ‘Just by the law of numbers, if you go back far enough, you’re related in one way or another to an awfully large number of people.

‘However, it’s not simply a matter of numbers and some people connect into lines that have all sorts of significant people associated with them.’

The Thracians were an Indo-European nomadic people who settled in the central Balkans around 5,000 years ago.

They were a loose, tribal society, uniting only after the Persian invasions of the 6th and 5th centuries BC to establish a powerful kingdom over modern Romania and Bulgaria. 

Mentioned in Homer's 'Iliad' as allies of Troy, they were fierce warriors and horse-breeders as well as being skilled goldsmiths.

Leader: Spartacus was one of the slave leaders in a slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, or the Gladiators' War. He is pictured here being portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film

Its capital was thought to be Seutopolis, whose ancient ruins lie under a large artificial lake near Shipka, in an area dubbed 'the Bulgarian Valley of Kings' for its many rich tombs. Artefacts discovered in these tombs in recent decades provide most of what is known of their culture.

Spartacus lived from 109 to 71 BC and was a Thracian gladiator, who was one of the slave leaders in a slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, or the Gladiators’ War.

He had escaped from slavery in 73BC and took refuge on nearby Mount Vesuvius. He led an army estimated to have contained 100,000 men and defeated a series of Roman attacks.

However, he was eventually killed in a battle with the Romans – and around 6,000 of his followers who escaped were found and crucified.

The Thracians were conquered by Rome in the first century AD and the last vestiges of their cuilture were extinguished as they were assimilated by invading Slav peoples five centuries later. They had no written language, and so left no records.

Ancestry: An illustration of the DNA double helix, represented as the traditional twisted ladder

Mr Sykes used a scheme run by researchers at ScotlandsDNA, a company which says it can ‘trace your genetic inheritance beyond the written record’.

It looks at ancestry through your fatherline - testing 15,000 Y chromosome markers - and your motherline, along every known mitochondrial DNA branch with 3,000 markers.

People interested in their past can order a test pack and provide a sample of salivia in a small tube with a mouthpiece.

It is advised that people should not eat or drink anything for at least an hour before doing this.

The ‘spit kit’ sample should then be sent off to a laboratory.

The DNA is purified from the sample, and checked for quality.

Selected genetic markers in the DNA are then interpreted by experts to assign people to a specific lineage group.

The lab will usually come back to people with this result within two months of receiving the sample.

Various packages are available from ScotlandsDNA, ranging from £129 to £250 - depending on whether applicants want to know about their father's side, mother's side, or both.
