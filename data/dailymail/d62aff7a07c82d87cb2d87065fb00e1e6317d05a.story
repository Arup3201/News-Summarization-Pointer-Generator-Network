Gold bars stolen in a £1 million bullion snatch involving the stepfather of The Only Way Is Essex stars Sam and Billie Faiers were found hidden inside a woman’s bra, a court heard today.

The alleged gang used an ‘inside man’ to steal the gold in a fake lorry hi-jacking in Belgium before trying to smuggle it back to the UK and convert it into cash.

Sheron Mancini, 53, was later caught with two ingots inside her underwear when she was stopped by Belgian police in a car with her husband David Gale a week after the snatch, the Old Bailey heard.

Accused: Sheron Mancini was discovered with bars of gold in her bra, a jury was told

‘She could provide no sensible explanation for the discovery of this gold concealed in her underwear,’ said prosecutor John Price QC.

‘For in truth, there could be none.’

Gale, 55, who has already admitted his part in the plot, was caught with grains of silver stolen in the same raid inside his travel bag at the same time.

Also among the six who have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy is David Chatwood, 58, who is married to the Faiers sisters’ mother Sue Wells and shares a home with them in Brentwood.

Mancini is on trial alongside John 
Corley, 52, Kyriacos Nicolas, 30, and his father Andreas Nicolas, 50, 
over their alleged involvement.

Jurors in the trial have been told the Faiers sisters will be called as witnesses during the case.

Belgian
police discovered lorry driver Brian Mulcahy, 46, seemingly locked 
inside the trailer of his vehicle at a service station near Wetteren 
last October 4, jurors have been told.

He
had been transporting a consigment of 25kg of gold bullion and 150kg of
silver grain from Vilvoorde, near Brussels, back to the UK.

Mulcahy, who has admitted his part in the crime, told officers he had been hijacked and gunpoint and his cargo stolen before he was locked inside the trailer.

But his account was ‘pure fiction’, said Mr Price.

‘Mr Mulcahy had not been the victim of a robbery,’ he added.

‘No violence or threat or violence was used against him.

‘It hadn’t been necessary for anyone to do so because in this instance the driver of the lorry was one of the thieves.’

But the plan was ‘doomed to fail’, said the prosecutor, because several key players were under surveillance by UK police.

Corley is said to have been instrumental in the plot, travelling to the continent on several occasions and attending regular meetings with other conspirators.

Jurors have been told he will not dispute he was present, but will claim he did not realise the nature of the plan.

Corley, of Biggin Hill, Kent; and Kyriacos Nicolas, of Winchmore Hill, north London, deny alternative counts of conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property.

Mancini, of Roydon, Harlow, Essex; and Andreas Nicolas, of Duxford, Cambridgeshire, deny conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert or transfer criminal property.

Mancini was cleared of conspiracy to steal on the directions of the judge after prosecutors offered no evidence shortly after a jury was sworn in to try her.

Stanely Rose, 75, Gary Cummings, 51, and Matthew Middleton, 42, along with Chatwood, Mulcahy and Gale, have already admitted their part in the plot.

Chatwood, of Brentwood, Essex; Mulcahy, of Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex; Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex; Rose, of Pilgrims Hatch, Brentwoodand; Cummings, of Ilford, Essex; Middleton, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, all admitted conspiracy to steal.

The trial continues.
