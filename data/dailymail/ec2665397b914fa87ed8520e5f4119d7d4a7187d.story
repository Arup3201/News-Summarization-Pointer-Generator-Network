They are marketed as being healthier than conventional cigarettes, but researchers believe people who smoke electronic cigarettes could be putting themselves at greater risk than regular smokers.

People who smoke e-cigarettes may inhale higher concentrations of nicotine and of other toxins,say U.S researchers. 

So far little research has been carried out into using e-cigarettes, but scientists at the U.S. College of Dentistry have now set up a study to find out the health effects.

Nicotine is both addictive and, in large quantities, toxic - and some of the other chemicals found in e-cigarettes are believed to be carcinogenic.

Researchers say people who smoke electronic cigarettes instead of traditional ones might be absorbing higher concentrations of dangerous chemicals

Researchers at New York University say that due to the ‘frequency of puffing’ and ‘depth of inhalation’ ,e-cigarette smokers may absorb higher levels of harmful chemicals than those who smoke traditional cigarettes.

Initially, e-cigarettes were seen as a healthier, tobacco-free alternative for people who were addicted to nicotine.

However, health agencies have challenged this assumption since they were first marketed in around 2007.

More current research has shown and they are now often smoked by people who have never smoked traditional cigarettes.

In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that 'consumers should be strongly advised not to use' electronic cigarettes until a reputable national regulatory body has found them safe and effective.

It said: 'The safety of ENDS has not been scientifically demonstrated [and] the potential risks they pose for the health of users remain undetermined.

'Furthermore, scientific testing indicates that the products vary widely in the amount of nicotine and other chemicals they deliver and there is no way for consumers to find out what is actually delivered by the product they have purchased.'

Dr Deepak Saxena, associate professor
 of basic science and craniofacial biology, said: ‘The issue is urgent 
as a recent survey conducted among students at eight U.S. colleges found
 that 12 per cent of e-cig users had never smoked a conventional 
cigarette.’

The U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration and the American Lung Association have 
cautioned that e-cigarette users are unknowingly inhaling vaporised 
chemicals.

E-cigarettes use a heating device to vaporise nicotine and other ingredients which simulate the visual, sensory, and behavioural aspects of smoking without the combustion of tobacco.

E-cigarettes employ a mechanism to heat up liquid nicotine, which turns into a vapour that smokers inhale and exhale, a process known as ‘vaping’.

Each nicotine cartridge in an e-cigarette can provide 200 to 400 puffs, equivalent to two to three packs of cigarettes.

‘Due to the frequency of puffing, depth of inhalation, and length of vaping,’ says Dr Xin Li, ‘e-cig users may actually absorb higher concentrations of nicotine and other toxins than conventional tobacco smokers.’

E-cigarettes are increasing no longer being seen as just a healthier alternative to cigarettes for people who are already addicted to nicotine
