Experts have long speculated that prehistoric tools were used to help early hunters kill and butcher animals but evidence to back up these claims has been lacking - until now.

Researchers analysing elephant remains in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves.

And by replicating the flint tools for a modern butchering experiment they said the 'handaxe was prehistoric man's 'Swiss army knife' - capable of breaking down bone, sinew and hide. 

Researchers analysing elephant remains (rib pictured) in Israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called 'handaxes and scrapers' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves. This analysis is said to be the first time proof of prehistoric butchery has been scientifically verified

The slimmer, more delicate scraper was then used to separate fur and animal fat from muscle tissue. 

The tools and remains were discovered at a Lower Paleolithic site in Revadim, Israel, by Professor Ran Barkai, Natasha Solodenko and Andrea Zupanchich from Tel Aviv University's Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures. 

The team used a process called 'use-wear analysis' which involves examining the surfaces and edges of the tools to determine their function. 

The researchers studied three tools found in the Revadim quarry in Israel - a flake, biface or 'handaxe' and scraper. 

No use-traces or identifiable residue was found on the flake.

The biface and scraper both revealed 'well preserved and clear use-wear traces'. 

The biface use traces indicate the processing of 'medium-hard material' believed to be evidence of hide scraping. 

The scraper instead featured traces of 'soft or medium material'. 

This is believed to be animal tissue.

Both tools showed residue of adipocere, or animal fat and on the scraper, both tissues and vegetable residues were found.

It also used so-called Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) residue analysis to identify organic residue.

FTIR uses infrared to identify bio-signatures of prehistoric compounds. 

From this, the researchers were able to demonstrate for the first time direct proof of animal exploitation by flint tools. 

'There are three parts to this puzzle: the expansion of the human brain, the shift to meat consumption, and the ability to develop sophisticated technology to meet the new biological demands,' Professor Barkai said.

'The invention of stone technology was a major breakthrough in human evolution.'

Fracturing rocks in order to butcher and cut animal meat is said to represent a key biological and cultural milestone.

'At the Revadim quarry we found butchered animal remains, including an elephant rib bone which had been neatly cut by a stone tool, alongside flint handaxes and scrapers still retaining animal fat,' continued Professor Barkai.

'It became clear from further analyses that butchering and carcass processing indeed took place at this site.'

The experts said the 'handaxe' was the equivalent to a prehistoric 'Swiss army knife' (stock image) - capable of breaking down bone, sinew and hide

The paper said the tools would have also been used to process hides.

Prehistoric peoples made use of all parts of the animal.

In the case of the elephant, for example, they would have needed to use both tools to manage such a challenging task.

'The knowledge of how to make these tools was precious, and must have been passed along from generation to generation, because these tools were reproduced the same way across great territorial expanses and over hundreds of thousands of years,' said Professor Barkai.

'In this thousand-piece puzzle called archaeology, sometimes we find pieces that connect other pieces together. 

'This is what we have found with the stone tools and animal bones.' 

The research, published in Plos One, was done in collaboration with Dr Stella Ninziante Cesaro and Dr Cristina Lemorini of La Sapienza, University of Rome, and Dr Ofer Marder of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. 

The damaged edge of the scraper is shown. 'In this thousand-piece puzzle called archaeology, sometimes we find pieces that connect other pieces together,' said lead researcher Professor Ran Barkai. 'This is what we have found with the stone tools and animal bones'
