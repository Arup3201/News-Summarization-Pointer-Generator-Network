Christmas is usually a time for nice surprises – but not if you tune in to the BBC.

The corporation has been accused of ‘fobbing us off’ with old programmes after it emerged almost half of its TV schedule over the festive period will be repeats.

During Christmas week, viewers will be presented with nearly 300 hours of reruns on the four main channels, including vintage hits such as Dad’s Army, Morecambe & Wise and ’Allo ’Allo!

Classic: Family favourites including Dad's Army are among the repeats to be shown on BBC over the festive period

The worst offender is BBC2, where seven out of ten programmes will be repeats –  prompting accusations the corporation is failing licence fee payers by not providing enough new shows.

Last night Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘The BBC needs to think long and hard about showing so many old programmes, because the licence fee payer will question why they are handing out £3.5billion for new material.

If they continue to fob us off with the same old shows people will start asking for their money back.’

Between Saturday, December 21, and Friday, December 27, 47 per cent of the output on the BBC’s two main channels will be repeats.

Of 186 shows scheduled to air on BBC1, 55 will be reruns – 10 per cent more than over the same period last year.

Among the tried and tested family favourites will be The Vicar of Dibley, Miranda, and old episodes of Flog It!

There is some good news, however – amid the glut of repeats, viewers will also be able to look forward to some new dramas.

But because most of them have been scheduled at the same time on Christmas Day, it will be impossible to catch them all without using the record button.

The biggest clash will be between the BBC and ITV on the afternoon of December 25.

The much-hyped Downton Abbey special on ITV will be aired at the same time as EastEnders on BBC1, followed by Mrs Brown’s Boys.

Other highlights will be the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special and an adaptation of M R James’s chilling ghost story The Tractate Middoth on BBC2.

Viewers will also eagerly tune in to the Doctor Who Christmas special, which will see the departure of Matt Smith, the current Doctor, and the arrival of the new Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi. But fans of BBC1’s Sherlock, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch, will have to wait until New Year’s Day for the start of series three.

Those who switch over to Channel 4 in the hope of something new will be confronted by a schedule filled with reruns of The Simpsons and Father Ted. Almost 60 per cent of the broadcaster’s output will be repeats, compared with a relatively modest 28 per cent on ITV.

And viewers looking forward to blockbuster film premieres will instead have to make do with old favourites from the back catalogue, such as Finding Nemo and Emma.

Of 56 films to be shown on BBC1 and BBC2 over the period, only seven will be network premieres.

Those hoping to recover from their festive excesses by slumping down in front of the TV in the  days after Christmas will be particularly disappointed.

On Friday December 27, BBC2 will show nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm. In total, the main broadcasters will show 52 hours of second-hand programming that day.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Well over 90 per cent of programmes in peak on BBC1 will be brand new, including the regeneration of Doctor Who, and the eagerly anticipated return of Sherlock for example.

‘In daytime, there are some carefully chosen family film favourites alongside more premieres than any other channel and much loved treats from Christmases past including The Gruffalo.’

Insiders said BBC2 would offer a ‘complementary schedule’ with ‘classic favourites’ shown alongside some new shows.

Channel 4 suffered a huge ratings slump this year as viewers switched off its flagship ‘sex season’ and accused it of dumbing down its news programmes.

Its overall share of the TV audience dropped by more than 11 per cent on last year, while rivals ITV and Sky 1 saw their fortunes improve.

The broadcaster’s ratings are now on a par with BBC2 and only slightly better than Channel 5, according to figures compiled by industry magazine Broadcast.

The disappointing annual results come less than six months after regulator Ofcom wrote to Channel 4 executives expressing ‘concern’ over falling ratings.

Viewing figures for some popular shows, such as Countdown, have halved in recent years, and the channel’s licence is set to expire at the end of 2014.

Meanwhile, Channel 4 executives have continued to rake in huge salaries. Chief executive David Abraham received a £100,000 bonus in May, taking his total salary to £744,000.

Over the past 12 months, the channel has had just under a 6 per cent share of all TV viewing, compared with 21 per cent for BBC1 and 17 per cent for ITV.

In a desperate attempt to boost audiences, Channel 4 screened a season of sex-themed shows this autumn – but the flagship programme attracted fewer than 900,000 viewers.

Others have accused Channel 4 News of being less serious than its competitors. But host Jon Snow defended it, saying: ‘It should be other. It should be for those, perhaps, who have less of a voice anywhere else.’

Re-runs: Between Saturday, December 21, and Friday, December 27, 47 per cent of the output on the BBC¿s two main channels will be repeats. Morecambe and Wise repeats will be aired
