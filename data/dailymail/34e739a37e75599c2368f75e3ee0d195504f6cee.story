Meet North Korea's first girl band - although they may have to work on the name and outfits.

Decked out in military uniform and close to tears, the fearsome sounding 'Art Squad' played live in capital Pyongyang to celebrate the 70th birthday of former leader Kim Jong il, who died two months ago.

Huge memorial celebrations were led by his son and successor Kim Jong Un, who has used this event to give the world's media an unprecedented view of his oppressed nation.

Girl power: The Art Squad were at the forefront of North Korea's celebrations of Kim Jong il's birthday

And in particular he gave women a leading role on the day, which included this girl band and the nation's top young synchronized swimmers.

A sombre Kim Jong Un wore a dark Mao-style suit and bowed deeply before a large portrait of his smiling father for much of yesterday.

Hundreds of senior officials, military leaders and citizens also paid their respects.

Outside his palace, a huge crowd of North Korean soldiers lined up in neat rows listened to speeches praising his dynasty.

Making a splash: Many young women took part in a mass synchronized swimming show in Pyongyang

Talented: The women performed, as a grand finale, the song 'We Will Defend General Kim Jong Un at the Risk of Our Lives'

Later the new leader and other officials watched as goose-stepping soldiers marched by, followed by military jeeps and trucks carrying artillery guns and rocket launchers.

Fireworks exploded, military music boomed and people waved artificial pink and red flowers.

Kim Jong Il ruled with an iron fist for 17 years, a period that included a famine in the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of people and protracted tensions over the nation’s drive to build nuclear weapons.

Food shortages persist in North Korea and relations with South Korea are at their lowest point in years. But since Kim’s death two months ago, expressions of mourning and adoration have been common in Pyongyang.

After the funeral, Kim Jong Un was named supreme commander of the country’s 1.2 million-member military. State media and officials have praised Kim Jong il as a strong but benevolent leader, while calling Kim Jong Un the unquestioned choice to succeed him in this socialist nation of 24 million.

'We will faithfully uphold the "military-first" leadership of our respected supreme commander and comrade with our guns,” military General Staff chief Ri Yong Ho said in a speech yesterday.

While troops roared 'Let’s dedicate our lives to protect Kim Jong Un!'.

Masses: North Koreans pay respects to their late leader Kim Jong-Il by laying flowers

Outpouring: Huge numbers of North Koreans stood quietly to pay their respects

At Kim Il Sung Square, the main plaza in the capital, North Koreans bowed and laid flowers, including red 'kimjongilia' begonias, at a portrait of Kim Jong Il hanging on the Grand People’s Study House. Among them was Paek Won Chol, who described himself as a “soldier and disciple” of Kim Jong Il.

'I will devote my all for the building of a powerful and prosperous nation' under Kim Jong Un,' Paek said.

Yesterday's memorial could serve as closure to North Korea’s mourning ahead of important nuclear talks next week with the United States.
