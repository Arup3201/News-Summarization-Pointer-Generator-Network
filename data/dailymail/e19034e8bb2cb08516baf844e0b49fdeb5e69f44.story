More than a third of people wrongly believe being HIV positive prevents someone from working as a nursery school teacher, chef or with people with mental illnesses, according to new research.

Findings from a poll taken by 5,000 people showed that the public are ‘in the dark’ about the realities of living with human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, the National Aids Trust (NAT) said.

The survey findings, released on the 30th anniversary of the discovery of the HIV virus, showed one in five, or 20 per cent, of the public wrongly believe that people with HIV can only expect to live for 10 years after acquiring the virus, even if they are on treatment and not diagnosed late.

Only 16 per cent of respondents correctly stated that people with HIV can expect to have a normal life expectancy when they are being successfully treated and are not diagnosed late.

The research also showed that more than a third (36 per cent) of people wrongly thought that being HIV positive prevented someone from working as a nursery school teacher, a chef or with people with mental health problems.

The charity said the only job that someone HIV positive cannot do is work in the front-line armed forces, a ban applying to anyone with a long-term medical condition that requires daily medication.

Dentists, surgeons and midwives who are HIV positive can practice as long as they are monitored and their ‘viral load’ - the level of the HIV virus in their blood - remains undetectable, the charity said.

A quarter of those surveyed, or 26 per cent, thought it was illegal not to disclose your HIV status to your beauty therapist, your GP, your tattooist, your dentist, your employer, or someone you are marrying.

The NAT said there is no legal requirement to disclose your HIV status to anyone, except in very few specific jobs such as dentists, surgeons and midwives.

Other findings from the research included that only five per cent of those surveyed knew that the chance of passing on HIV through unprotected sex is ‘virtually nil’ if someone is doing well on treatment.

Aids is the final stage of HIV infection, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections.

With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop Aids.

The charity said an estimated 100,000 people are HIV positive in the UK, of whom around 22,000 are thought to be undiagnosed.

Deborah Jack, NAT chief executive, said: ‘Thanks to effective treatment, the situation for someone who is diagnosed with HIV today is a world away from that faced by someone who was diagnosed when the virus was first discovered 30 years ago. However people's understanding hasn't kept pace with medical advances.’

She added: ‘Misunderstanding and fear about HIV is not only damaging to those living with the virus but makes people reluctant to get tested.

‘In the UK currently one in five people who have HIV don't know they have it.

‘This can have devastating consequences for their health as well as increasing the risk of them passing HIV on to their partner.

‘In the absence of public awareness campaigns or compulsory sex education it is up to individuals to educate themselves and those around them about HIV.’
