Charged: Gilbert Villanueva, 26, has been accused of stabbing his girlfriend and killing her mother last night

A 22-year-old single mother whose criminal ex-boyfriend allegedly stabbed her and killed her mom had dropped a restraining order against him just weeks before last night's brazen attack.

Camden's Gilbert Villanueva, 26, was today charged with fatally stabbing Suzanne DuRocher, 50, and viciously wounding his former flame Kristen DuRocher in their Merchantville, New Jersey home.

Villanueva allegedly broke into the women's house on the 100 block of Prospect Street about 10.30pm, and went up to Kristen's bedroom on the second floor.

When Suzanne heard the confrontation, she  tried to make Villanueva leave and he stabbed her with a pocket-knife, according to CBS.

Police said he then stabbed Kristen.

Kristen’s young daughter was also in the house but was unharmed. She is not Villanueva's child.

Kristen and Villanueva had reportedly once dated, but their one-year relationship was tumultuous. 

CBS reported Kristen had taken out a restraining order against Villanueva on October 27, but dropped it on October 31. 

Villanueva, a father of two, also reportedly had four prior arrests for weapons and terrorist threats, including three convictions.

Last night, neighbor Andrew Kuppler told WPVI Kristen knocked on his door about 10.30pm and said she 
needed help for her and her mother.

'She
looked like she was in shock. She had some obvious wounds to her arm,'
Kuppler said.

'She just said she was attacked, she was stabbed, and that
she needed some help, so we called 911 and told the police what was 
going on.'

Suzanne, a mother of three, was rushed to Cooper University 
Hospital where she died from her wounds, while Kristen Durocher was in a
stable condition.

CBS reported investigators interviewed Villanueva’s sister who claimed she picked him up from behind a Dunkin’ Donuts on Marlton Pike.

Police said he confessed to his sister that he stabbed the two women.

Officers then found Villanueva after nurses at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden reported they were treating the man with suspicious 'knife wounds' on his hands about 11.30pm.

Courier-Post reported Kristen met Villanueva about a 
year ago at a Brooklawn Taco Bell where they both worked.

The relationship 
quickly deteriorated, and DuRocher was granted a restraining order 
against her former lover.

Even though she dropped it days later, he was not welcome at her home.

Courier-Post also reported the murder suspect has another restraining order against him, which is still in place, that was filed by a woman in Burlington County in 2006.

He has two children and another on the way.

Suzanne, a grandmother, was Temple University Hospital's associate chief nursing officer of operations.

'We extend our sincerest condolences 
to her family and friends as they begin to deal with the after-effects 
of this tragic loss,' the hospital said in a statement.

'For the past eight years, Suzanne 
has been a vital and well-respected member of the Hospital's leadership 
team. She touched each of us & and our patients & in a very 
special way.

'She eagerly shared with colleagues 
her extensive knowledge and commitment to advanced nursing practice in 
the delivery of quality, compassionate care to patients.'

It is not the first time tragedy has touched the DuRocher family.

Suzanne's husband, Robert DuRocher, was killed in an industrial accident in Moorestown, New Jersey on February 15, 2011, according to philly.com.

Villanueva was arraigned on Thursday afternoon and is being held on $1.75 million bail.
