Luis Suarez has played down claims that he bit Giorgio Chiellini and claimed that he 'had contact, nothing more.'

The Uruguay striker looked to have sunk his teeth into the Italian defender's shoulder minutes before Diego Godin scored the decisive goal in Uruguay's 1-0 win in Natal.

But the controversial forward said after the game: 'These situations happen on the field.

FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings, to which Uruguay and Suarez have until 9pm UK time on Wednesday to provide evidence.

A statement on FIFA's website said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of art. 48 and/or art. 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

'The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide with their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.

'According to art. 77 lit. a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), the FIFA Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials' attention.

'Furthermore, according to art. 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).'Click here for the full story 

'I had contact with his shoulder, nothing more, things like that happen all the time.

'I don't know anything, if FIFA analyse each case separately it's going to be complicated.

I'm very happy to qualify against a European team, after the first match against Costa Rica it was difficult to reverse the situation but we played an incredible match today"

And Uruguay captain Diego Lugano launched an incredible defence of his frontman.

Despite replays of the incident seeming to obviously show Suarez as in the wrong with, if not a bite, a headbutt, team-mate Lugano chose to defend the Liverpool striker and instead called out Chiellini as the guilty party for appealing against Suarez.

'You need to show me the incident, because I didn't see anything,' the West Brom defender said after the match.

'Did you see it today or did you see what happened in other years? You couldn't have seen it today because nothing happened.

'Chiellini’s attitude is worst of all. He's a great player, with an enormous status. It doesn't correspond with Italian football. As sportsmen leaving the field, crying and appealing against a rival.

'As a man, he disappointed me totally.'

Suarez has a history of biting opponents and was suspended for 10 games after an incident with Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in November 2013 and a 7-game ban for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in April 2010.

The Uruguayan striker - if found guilty of biting - could face a ban that would rule him out of the rest of the World Cup.

FIFA said afterwards that they were awaiting the official match report and 'gathering all necessary information before making a decision'.
