Hero: Mark Linn, pictured, sprang into action when he noticed the bus driver slumped over the wheel of the bus

A quick-thinking high school band director saved the lives of more than 120 students and teachers yesterday when he took the wheel of an out-of-control bus after the driver passed out.

Mark Linn sprang into action when he noticed the man slumped over the wheel of the bus as it was driving 70 miles per hour through a construction zone on a Georgia interstate.

The Parkway North Vikings marching band was traveling from their home town of St. Louis, Missouri, to Orlando to begin a spring break cruise to the Bahamas when the incident occurred at around 6:30 a.m. near Atlanta.

'The chaperone behind me said "Mark, something's wrong with the driver." So I got up and he was slumped over the wheel,' Linn told KSDK.com.

'At that time I tried to shake him, thinking he had just fallen asleep.'

But he was actually unconscious and the runaway bus was speeding dangerously down the highway, with 108 students and 20 adults on board.

'We hit pylons and traffic cones and barrels and skidded off a guard rail once,' Linn said. 'I grabbed the wheel and tried to get his foot off the accelerator then put my leg between his and hit the brake and guided it to a stop.'

After bringing the bus to a halt, the driver regained consciousness and a doctor, who was luckily on board saw that he was OK.

The band then continued on, spending last night in Cocoa Beach, Florida, before beginning the three day cruise today.

But Linn's students won't be quick to
forget how their brave band director saved their lives and some were 
hailing him as a hero on Facebook yesterday.

'You probably won't read about it in the papers, and it probably won't make any headlines, but my high school band teacher Mark Linn prevented what could have been a headline making catastrophe,' one student wrote.

Linn admitted he was pretty frightened by the incident and said at one point he thought the bus was going to crash. But thankfully, the story's ending was a happy one.

'To be quite frank, it was pretty scary,' Linn told KSDK.com.

'Because I was concerned not only for our driver, but for our kids, and there were a couple of seconds there I wasn't sure if it was going to work out okay. But thank god I was able to wrestle the wheel away from him and get the bus stopped.'
