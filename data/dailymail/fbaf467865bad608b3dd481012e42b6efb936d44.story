Jason Statham is now a Hollywood star who has appeared in a number of blockbuster films, but before that he could be found treading the boards - the diving boards.

Long before becoming a worldwide movie star, Statham competed for England in the diving competition at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland.

Statham didn't trouble the medal places on that occasion in New Zealand but he found success in another form later in life.

Statham's best finish in Auckland was eighth place in the 1-metre springboard with a score of 487.26 points.

He also took part in the 3-metre springboard and 10-metre platform, where he finished 11th in both events.

Fortunately for the 46-year-old, his performances on the big screens have been much better than those on the high boards.

Since his Auckland aquatic appearance, Statham has risen to fame thanks to his performances in films such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Mean Machine and The Bank Job.
