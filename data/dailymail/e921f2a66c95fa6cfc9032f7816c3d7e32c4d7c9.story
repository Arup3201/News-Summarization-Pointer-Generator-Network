A homeless man has appeared in court charged with the pre-dawn rape and murder of a hospitality worker in a central Melbourne park.

Scott Allen Miller, 42, remained alert in the dock during a brief hearing at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he stands accused of killing Chinese national Yuk Ling Lau while she was on her way to work.

Miller, who had been living on the streets for two months, looked bewildered and yawned several times during the short hearing, the Herald Sun reports.

Legal Aid solicitor Sarah Pratt told the court that Miller had suffered a previous drug-induced psychosis and required a prison health assessment.

'It’s his first time in custody,' Ms Pratt said.

A police application to retain forensic samples taken from Miller was granted and he was remanded to reappear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on October 24.

Ms Lau, a 32-year-old pastry chef from Hong Kong, was found dead by joggers in Kings Domain on Sunday morning at 5.30am.

Miller was arrested near Eden on the NSW far south coast on Monday following a three-day manhunt. He was extradited to Victoria on Tuesday and was charged in Melbourne that night.

Ms Lau's friends, who knew her as Renea, remembered her as a 'beautiful friend and colleague' and a large group of them attended the hearing on Wednesday.

A colleague who worked with Ms Lau at the dessert bar in Melbourne's inner-east, Steven Kearney, said she was a 'wonderful person'.

'I would just like to state with deep sadness that Renea was an employee,' Mr Kearney told The Age.

'She will be terribly missed here. She was... a beautiful friend and colleague. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her family and friends and all our thoughts are with them.'

Mr Kearney asked the media to respect his and his other colleagues' privacy as they were 'grieving and working through this difficult time'.

Ms Lau had moved to Australia in 2012. Her family will arrive in Australia later this week to formally identify her body.

Homicide Squad Detective Inspector John Potter confirmed on Monday that Ms Lau had been sexually assaulted before she died.

'This is a particularly violent assault on this woman, she has been sexually assaulted and she has been physically assaulted,' Insp Potter said.

Miller was arrested by an off-duty police officer near Eden, while camping in a small cove area and was later taken to a police station.

Yuk Ling Lau's parents are due to arrive from Hong Kong this week to take their daughter's body home 

He was born in the US and once lived in an affluent Perth suburb.

In the 1990s, he was a leading figure in the illegal dance party scene in Perth as director of E-Nerve Pty Ltd a company that organised raves, The Age reported.

Homicide Squad detectives had appealed for help on Monday to identify a second man who was seen out drinking with Miller on the night of the crime and may be able to assist with the investigation.

Police confirmed that the man seen on CCTV footage walking along Swanston Street with Miller about 1.50am on Saturday had contacted police.

He attended a city police station and made a statement on Monday evening.
