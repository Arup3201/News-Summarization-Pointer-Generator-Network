Up to 50 MPs are supporting a call for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped in favour of a voluntary subscription service, it has been revealed. 

A group of Conservatives will support an appeal to the Culture Secretary Sajid Javid urging a review into funding for the corporation.

It is led by Tory MP Andrew Bridgen who was written to Mr Javid to say the current funding arrangement is 'increasingly becoming unsustainable and out of keeping with the modern media environment'.

Mr Bridgen told MailOnline: 'The licence fee is an anachronism. It dates back to a time when there wasn't much choice.

'At the end of the day, I think the BBC has got to be independent of government. 

'However, the funding mechanism is effectively a poll tax - and independent of people who pay for it.

'The way it is collected is heavy-handed. Criminality should not be part of it.'

In the letter, which is reproduced below in full, Mr Bridgen said expressed his concern for the sustainability of the BBC's funding structure.

He wrote: 'I believe strongly that the BBC should be planning for a future without the licence fee and investigating subscription based payment options as well as a wealth of other opportunities that exist for its worldwide operation.'

He added that nearly 500,000 people access BBC content via the iPlayer for free meaning licence fee payers are 'being discriminated to the tune of around £70million.'

And Mr Javid has already said the £145.50 fee is big expense for families and 'nothing will be ruled out' when it is reviewed next year.

Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr show in June, he said the BBC Charter, which sets out its scope and remit and will be renewed for another decade in 2016, must take into account big technological changes in how people watch programmes. 

The corporation has recently come under fire for spending licence fee money on an awards ceremony for staff and freebies for celebrities and politicians - despite plans to axe 400 jobs.

This week, it was revealed that the corporation spent more than £23,000 on tickets and hospitality for this year’s events, including for BBC Proms, with guests as varied as Homeland star Damian Lewis, Home Secretary Theresa May, Local Government and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, and presenter Sir David Attenborough rubbing shoulders at the licence fee payer’s expense. 

Costs for the Corporation's annual Gillard Awards included a £35 Venison dinner for more than 200 people and free travel to and from a hotel, a source revealed.

The hotel costs alone for last year's event topped £25,000, with thousands more spent on alcohol and transport, it was alleged.

The Gillard awards ceremony, which celebrates local radio, was held months before bosses revealed more than 400 jobs would be axed in a bid to save millions.

An estimated 415 jobs are to be scrapped to save £48 million a year by 2016/17 with James Harding, the BBC's director of news and current affairs, describing the cuts as ' an extremely difficult undertaking.' 

Mr Bridgen added: 'In a time when all is transparent, the BBC are still opaque and that leads to suspicion.

'The BBC are telling us that they are world class and I believe they are - they should have no problem competing on a subscription service basis.' 

But the BBC has insisted its licence fee is vital to ensure its programmes can be accessed by everyone.

The corporation said the licence fee ensures wider access to its programming, and claimed support for the charge has increased in the past 10 years.

'At just £2.80 a week the BBC licence fee is excellent value for money - only this weekend newspapers have been reporting the rising costs of subscription services.

'It's vital that programmes like EastEnders, Strictly, Sherlock, Doctor Who and Match Of The Day can be watched by everyone - not a select few. 

'Support for the licence fee has actually risen by 22% since 2004 and remains the most popular way of funding the BBC.'
