A drunk who tried to squeeze under the glass wall of an ATM booth instead of using the door had to be rescued by baffled firemen.

Passers-by in Zhejiang, an eastern coastal province in China, called the emergency services when they found the man stuck fast and unconscious after a night on the town.

‘We think he got in by the door but, for some reason - he was incapable of explaining to us at the time - he decided to get out through the small ventilation gap at the bottom of one of the walls,’ said fire service spokesman Hsin Ke.

He added: ‘He was well and truly wedged and unfortunately he was too intoxicated to follow our instructions on how to get himself out so we had to smash the glass panel to remove him. It is going to turn out to be a very expensive night on the town for this man.’

Police - who later identified the man as Cheng Kao - said: ‘He will be charged for the cost of repairing the booth.’

‘He told us that he had entered the booth normally by using his bank card to authorise the doors to open and had gone to the cash machine to withdraw money.

Bad idea: The man's bank card was swallowed by the ATM - then he decided to exit by crawling out

‘But after inserting his pin number falsely three times, the cash machine swallowed the card. He said he was unable to open the door and thought the best way to get out was through the gap under the door.’

Earlier this year a man in China was left in agony for six hours after he trapped his arm in a filthy cesspit trying to retrieve his new mobile phone.

Chen Ho was using the public lavatories in the city of Jianyang in Sichuan province and talking to a friend when the device slipped out of his hand and down the toilet.

Connected to a deep cesspit, Chen rolled up his sleeves and fished around for the smartphone before his arm got stuck - sparking a six hour rescue operation.
