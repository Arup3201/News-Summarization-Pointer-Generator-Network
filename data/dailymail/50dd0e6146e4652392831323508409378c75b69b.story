Guinness World Records keepers estimated the odds of it happening were 17.7 billion to 1.

And come February 20 each year, there are a lot of cakes inside the Cummins house in Virginia.

That's because it's the birthday of five of the family's children.

The running joke among parents Ralph and Carolyn Cummins is that Ralph, a football coach inducted into the National High School Sports Hall of Fame, 'wasn’t so preoccupied' in June.

It is also the month of their wedding anniversary, according to Times Dispatch.

Catherine, Carol, Charles, Claudia and Cecilia were all born on February 20 but in different years.

Proud parents: Ralph and Carolyn Cummins

The family was entered into the 1977 Guinness World Records as 'the only verified record of a family producing five single children with the same date of birth'.

The record-keepers in 1977 estimated odds of that happening were 17.7 billion to 1.

Cheryl, 59, who has lived in the Richmond area for more than 25 years, makes sure everyone knows about her family’s oddity every Feb. 20.

'I love it when the birthdays come around because no one believes it,' she said.

Guinness World Records doesn’t feature their family in every edition, so she carries a 2003 copy to show doubters.

It’s been several years since they have all been together for the big day, but a round of phone calls and a stack of mailed birthday cards are customary.

The years Carolyn wasn’t in labor, she came home early from work every Feb. 19 and baked and decorated cakes all afternoon — a football field for Charles, the dress of a doll with a doll standing on top for Claudia, roses for Catherine, and many more.

One year, she made cakes with clock faces displaying the time each of the children was born on their respective Feb. 20.

Even when the older girls left for college, Carolyn made a birthday cake for them and stuck it in the freezer, awaiting the day they came home from spring break.

'She just really made it special,' Claudia said.

'It was so cool that she had that mother’s instinct to make sure everyone was OK and have all our individual needs met.'

The true record-holders — Ralph and Carolyn Cummins — could not be reached Thursday night in between their rounds of birthday phone calls from their Florida winter home.

The birthday record is nothing more than a display of the family’s values, Cheryl said.

'We believe in togetherness in my family,' she said.

At the end of the day, though, Catherine jokes: 'I led the way. It’s really my birthday.'
