The historic Special Relationship between the UK and the US is under ‘some strain’ following last night’s Government defeat, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned.

If the US goes ahead with planned strikes on Damascus, it will have to turn to France and other allies for support - even though David Cameron has been instrumental in persuading Barack Obama to act.

For months, the Prime Minister and other senior members of the Government have been putting pressure on the US administration to do more over Syria.

Mr Cameron told President Obama he was ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with the US when the two spoke last weekend. 

But the Prime Minister did warn the president that the long shadow of the Iraq War could make winning support for action difficult.

Serious concern: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he did not expect the US to change its plans to go ahead with strikes

Mr Hammond said he did not expect the US to change its plans to go ahead with strikes. He also expressed serious concern about what the vote would mean for Britain on the world stage.

He said: ‘I do have a concern about what this says, what we are saying about ourselves.

‘We have to ask ourselves the question “do we want to be the type of nation to properly act to uphold the international system, the rule of international law, the system that benefits us as an open, democratic, trading nation, or will we turn our backs and leave that to others?”. It’s certainly going to place some strain on the Special Relationship.’

A close ally of the Prime Minister said 
it was the ‘first time in recent years where the Special Relationship 
won’t have delivered’.

And a diplomat said: ‘The Americans are livid with us’, adding that Mr Cameron appeared to have made an ‘enormous miscalculation’.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell also expressed concern, saying US lawmakers would be less sympathetic to upholding aspects of the Special Relationship such as intelligence sharing, missile sharing and free trade.

He said: ‘If you’re a congressman in the United States asked to be sympathetic towards these things, in the light of tonight’s decision what do you think your reaction would be?’

Washington analysts also said last night’s vote could damage the Special Relationship.

'This has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the United States and its biggest ally'

Robin Wright, of the US Institute for Peace called losing British support a ‘terrible setback’, adding: ‘This has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the United States and its biggest ally.’

The Government is now under pressure to confirm that the US would not be allowed to use British air bases to launch attacks on Syria as compensation for our failure to be involved directly.
