We've all been there, you try on a ring and go to remove it only to find that it won't budge. Or Maybe your fingers swell, whatever the reason - a stuck ring can cause panic.

You're tugging and tugging and your finger is getting bluer and bluer and before you know it you're reaching for the margerine.

Well put that butter down! There is a new solution to avoid this rather sticky (not to mention slimy) situation and all you need is a piece of string.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The simple trick involves using just a pair of pliers and a piece of string, beginning by securing the string under the ring

A video that hit Facebook this week solves the age old problem of removing a ring that has become stuck on a finger with a clean and simple method.

In the video a man helps someone remove their ring using only pliers and a piece of string with a clever trick that involves creating a spiral of string for the ring to unwind on.

The man begins by using the pliers to get underneath the tight ring and push the string through it so it sits underneath.

In the video the man winds the string up the finger in a tight coil (left.) Once he reaches the centre of the finger he tucks the loose end of string under the coil (right)

He then continues by twisting the string around the finger towards the tip in a tight spiral until the string forms a tight coil from the base to the centre of the finger.

He then firmly secures the string at the centre of the finger by tucking the loose end under one of the folds of string.

Then returning to the base of the finger, the man takes the start of the string and simply unwinds the tightly wound coil that has been secured to the ring, bringing it clean off the finger.

The video has already received 4,795 shares and 8,098 likes on Facebook and it is no surprise what with many of us resorting visiting A&E to have precious rings cut off.

This neat trick has had thorough praise from it's viewers with 278 comments recommending the video.
