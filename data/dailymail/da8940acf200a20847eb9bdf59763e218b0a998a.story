The Post Office has launched its first festive advert in five years in an effort to bring more people in to its stores. 

The one-minute advert features comedian Robert Webb as the 'minister of Christmas' walking round a Post Office branch explaining their preparations for Christmas, which include longer opening hours and bigger parcel sizes. 

As he strolls around the shop, he bumps into singer Pixie Lott, with whom he poses for a selection of 'elfies', as well as Downton Abbey's Jim Carter, Amanda Holden and chef Gino D'Acampo.

The 'Get Christmas all wrapped up campaign' opts for a more humorous approach than the tear-jerking adverts of John Lewis and Sainsbury's. 

The advert will make its first TV showing during the breaks of the X Factor on ITV on Sunday evening. 

The group says that its Christmas campaign is designed to show people what its new branches can offer.

The advert is the first to be released by the Post Office in five years and takes a light and humorous approach

The number of post offices has halved since the 1960s to about 11,500 across the UK. 

Peter Markey, chief marketing officer, said: 'It’s the first time that we’ve advertised on TV at Christmas for more than five years. Over a third of our revenues on postage come at Christmas.'

The campaign is the first concerted drive by the Post Office to communicate its fusion of the digital and in-branch experience. 

'We did a smaller campaign in the summer," said Mr Markey. 'But this is the first where you can really see where we’re going. It’s more consistent in tone.' 

Post offices have been a staple of British life for decades, providing a place for people to pay their bills, collect benefits, get their car taxed and buy stamps locally. 

The number of Post Office's in the UK stood at 11,742 at the end of June 2013.  

But over the past 30 years the number of post offices in the UK has almost halved. 

In 1981/1982 there were 22,405 Post Offices. 

In 1991/1992 there were 20,160. By 2001/2002 this had fallen to 17,584. 

In 2011/2012 the number stood at 11,818. 

The previous Labour government claimed that 6,000 closures took place before 1997, and blamed changes in behaviour for this decline.

In addition, where local post offices used to be the only place to buy stamps, there are now many thousands of outlets across England and Wales where this is possible.

The network lost £4 million a week in 2006/07 and doubled its losses in 2005/06, despite an annual £150 million subsidy from the government. About 16,000 branches served less than 30 people a week, and all rural branches were losing money.

As such the government decided to close 2,500 branches, 

The present Coalition government has made it clear that it wishes to see 'a strong and sustainable future' for the Post Office network with no further closures.   

Post Office Ltd, which owns and runs the Post Office Network, was separated from Royal Mail Group Ltd on April 1 2012.
