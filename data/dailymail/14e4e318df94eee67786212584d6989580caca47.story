It was already a bold, brash and head turning car.

But now a company has unveiled plans to turn the Lamborghini Aventador into the world's first Lamborghini stretch limo.

British company Cars For Stars, which offers a high chauffeur-driven car hire service, has christened the car The Lambo, and fitted it with everything from heated seats to a champagne bar.

The concept for a stretch Lamborghini Aventador keeps the distinctive supercar doors, but adds Plasma TVs and a champagne bar

The interior features deep leather seats, a plasma TV complete with surround sound system and iPod dock, and a champagne bar complete with fridge

It has a rear compartment for passengers and two extra doors.

The firm has not yet built the car, but has unveiled images of what it will look like in fiery orange paintwork and is seeking sponsorship for the project.

The London-based  firm says the car will transform the limo experience into 'an explosion of luxury, style and glamour, making the Aventador limousine unlike any other existing limo concept'.

'The brand new conceptual design is a stretched-out version of the stunning and legendary Lamborghini Aventador, and has the fiery-orange trademark colour scheme.

'The brand new design stays true to the original Aventador model, keeping the iconic upwards-opening scissor doors – one of the Aventador’s most recognisable features.'

Passengers will be able to relax in rich leather seating embossed with the Cars For Stars logo, heated for winter comfort.

There are  plasma screen displays; surround sound audio with an iPod docking station and a champagne bar with drinks cooler.

The Aventador's 690-horsepower, 6.5  V-12 engine will be retained.

The firm admits it will need a sponsor to make the car, and says sponsors will get 12 months of free advertising, as well as having company name worked into the limo's official name.

Cars for Stars claims the design will keep the look of the Lamborghini Aventador, but add two extra doors to turn it into a stretch supercar

The interior of the car from the driver's point of view will remain largely the same, the firm behind the stretch supercar says
