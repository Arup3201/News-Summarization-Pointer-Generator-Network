A student who posted a series of racist comments on Twitter following footballer Fabrice Muamba’s cardiac arrest has begun a prison sentence of 56 days.

Liam Stacey, 21, caused widespread revulsion by reacting to Muamba’s mid-game collapse by writing: ‘LOL [laughing out loud], **** Muamba. He’s dead!!! #haha.’ He responded to criticism of that message with vile racist tweets.

The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter.

Stacey initially claimed his account 
had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially
aggravated harassment. He was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public 
outrage’ at his comments.

As he spent his first night 
behind bars, the two teams most shaken by Muamba's collapse replayed the
fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to 
death.

Tottenham Hotspur and Bolton Wanderers met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory.

It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him.

Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba

At the ground where the 23-year-old's
heart stopped, his teammate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from 
his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton
squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery.

Players from both sides wore T-shirts
bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the 
whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him.

Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from 
Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a
forensic scientist. Describing his tweets, prosecutor Louise Barron 
told the court: ‘The offence is clearly racially aggravated.

‘There was sustained and gratuitous 
racism. These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The 
recipients were disgusted.’

Jailing the student at Swansea 
Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the 
footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world
were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this
situation.

‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’

Stacey made his comments about the 
Bolton Wanderers midfielder while celebrating the Welsh 
rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month.

The judge added: ‘You committed this 
offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted 
it.

'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’

Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, 
told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was 
at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba.

'I don’t know why I 
posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from 
different cultural backgrounds.’

He later sent a text message to a 
friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and 
tweeted back to some people who abused me.

'Getting police on me now 
which isn’t good at all.’

Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’

Applause: Everybody clapped for Muamba at the start of the match (and below)

Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey 
‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good 
recovery’.

He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted 
these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his 
parents.

'For a moment of madness, his career has now gone.’ 

Stacey’s
father Neale, 49, and mother Hayley, 46, were visibly shocked when the 
details of his comments were read aloud yesterday.

Jim
Brisbane, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru-Wales, said: ‘Racist 
language is inappropriate in any setting and through any media.

'We hope this case will serve as a warning
to anyone who may think that comments made online are somehow beyond 
the law.’

Muamba is said to be 
continuing to make good progress at the London Chest Hospital, where he 
was visited by his Bolton teammates ahead of their rescheduled 
match against Tottenham.

The game was abandoned on March 17 following Muamba’s collapse.
