Susan May, 58, endured years of torture at the hands of her own son, Leigh May, 21

A mother who suffered years of abuse at the hands of her ADHD child has spoken of the moment she thought he was going to kill her. 

Susan May, 58, endured years of torture at the hands of her own son, Leigh May, 21.

From being spat on to having her hair pulled, the final straw was when he placed his hands around her neck. 

Susan desperately alerted her neighbour for help and police were called to the family home. 

Leigh has now been ordered not to approach his mother or enter the road where she lives in Chester after appearing at Flintshire Magistrates Court on July 9.

Susan said: 'I gave him everything and I got nothing back. 

'That final beating he had his hands round my neck and I thought he was going to kill me.

'When Leigh was growing up Mold court was my second home. 

'Even though his convictions were against me I was having to pay the court costs when he was under 18.

'Even after that I would still pay. I got his carers allowance for his ADHD, but he would borrow money off me for God knows what.

'In the last year I leant him over £2,000, and my partner leant him £1,000, none of which we’ll ever see again.'

Leigh was diagnosed with ADHD aged just five but unknown to his mother he was not taking his tablets at school.

His behaviour got worse at secondary school and Leigh was eventually expelled.

Susan said: 'Leigh hung around with a lot of the older boys and started smoking cannabis.

'I knew he smoked cigarettes because I would find them and snap them, but then the signs of drug use started appearing.

'When he was just 12 I found a bag of white powder and called the police. 

'He went mad, but it was the only way I thought he would get help.'

After that Susan says Leigh’s drug use spiralled and he also started dealing drugs.

He would borrow money from his mother and use her credit card and store cards as well.

Susan said: 'I tried to give him the best of everything, but nothing was ever enough.

'It was £100 here, £200 there, just to stop the men from knocking on my front door.

'I even got him a new Xbox for Christmas, only for him to sell it on Gumtree a week later.'

Despite everything the pair have been through, Leigh has never once apologised or shown remorse to his mother, according to Susan.

Even when her partner Michael was admitted to hospital with cancer earlier this year, Leigh’s behaviour still did not change she said.

She said: 'He has never said sorry to me about anything, even when my partner nearly left because of his behaviour.

'I have only seen him cry once, and that was when he broke up with his girlfriend.

'He lives with her now and I really hope he will turn his life around.

'I’m not going to see him for five years and hopefully then he will be better.

'But I don’t think he will change without help and I don’t want history to repeat itself.'

The court heard how Miss May believes her son has mental health issues with many of his problems stemming from his use of drugs.

May himself claimed a £7,000 drugs debt had resulted in him being threatened with a gun which was placed inside his mouth.

He received a 20-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months and was placed on supervision.

Leigh was also told by District Judge Andrew Shaw he had been spared an immediate custodial term due to significant changes he had since made to his lifestyle.
