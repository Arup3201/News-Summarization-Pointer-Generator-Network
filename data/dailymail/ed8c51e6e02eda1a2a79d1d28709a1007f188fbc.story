Emmanuel Adebayor has revealed how the draining effects of malaria left him unable to walk for a week.

The Tottenham striker will play his first pre season game against Celtic in a Helsinki friendly on Saturday.

A key player under sacked Tim Sherwood the Togo international will make his bow under new boss Mauricio Pochettino after flying home to London from an Africa trip to discover he had the potentially fatal disease.

The big man: Adebayor was key under Tim Sherwood last season but now needs to impress the new boss

'I went back to Togo during the holiday to spend some time with my family,' he said.

'I came home to London two weeks ago and then found out I had malaria. I was ill for a week or so, but now I am back training and feeling good now.

'For a week I couldn’t do anything.

'I lost a kilo which isn’t a lot, but I was very weak for one week. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t walk.

'It’s a common disease in Africa. When I go back it feels like I have a headache and because you are already in the country where it is common you know what medicine to take to make it go away quickly.

'But in London it’s not the same because it’s not a common disease.

New boss: Mauricio Pochettino could start Adebayor, who started last season out-of-favour

'I wasn’t too worried because I have seen lots of people with malaria because I grew up there.

'I knew it would take a few days and knock me down and take everything out of me. I also knew I would have to work hard to get my body back again.

'But I’m okay, fit and ready to play football again. That’s the main thing.'

Mauricio Pochettino will give run outs to Adebaor and the players who missed the recent tour of North America.

Spurs are close to finalising a deal for Sporting Lisbon centre half Eric Dier pending the results of the medical.

But the new managers reported no moves on the bid to sign Southampton’s wantaway midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin following reports of interest from north London rivals Arsenal.

Pochettino said: 'We have 22 players and it’s important to play the players who missed the American tour like Emmanuel.

'He is a young player, an under-21 international and a strong centre-back. We hope he will help us this season.'

'With regards to Scheiderlin you know we never talk about a player from another club.

'It’s like before. If there is any news or anything happens the club will communicate with the media.'
