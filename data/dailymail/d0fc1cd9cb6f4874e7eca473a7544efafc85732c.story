Tyger Drew-Honey, who has a new documentary series starting on BBC3 later this month

Surely it seems only about five minutes since Tyger Drew-Honey was the chubby-cheeked, pre-teen, sensible eldest son of the Brockman family in TV’s Outnumbered. But now here he is, aged 18 and all chiselled-features and startling blue eyes, and very much a young man with opinions.

After six years of being one of Britain’s favourite sitcoms, Outnumbered may have finished but Tyger is still very much in demand. He’s still acting and recently completed a second series of BBC3’s Cuckoo, but in the meantime he’s turned into a teenage version of Louis Theroux.

In his new documentary series, Tyger On . . ., he investigates what it’s like being a teenager in Britain today. Among the topics Tyger has picked are internet ­dating and body image — including the modern cult of the ‘selfie’.

One of the most disturbing topics he tackles is pornography. And here Tyger has — somewhat shockingly — a very ­personal perspective on an industry ­ruthlessly targeting modern teens. 

His full name is Lindzi James Tyger Drew-Honey — an amalgamation of the names of his parents, who were both involved in the porn industry and, in fact, made a fortune from it.

His father is Simon Honey, one of the porn industry’s most famous names both for starring in and producing porn films, while his mother Lindzi Drew was a ­glamour model, video porn star (she gave it up when Tyger was born) and the editor of porn magazine Penthouse.

Before the internet, there was a lot of money to be made from porn videos; Tyger grew up in a £2 million house in Surrey and was sent to the best schools.

Almost inevitably, at his private school, Epsom College, bullies would taunt him about what his parents did; he never showed them how much it hurt. ‘I didn’t react, I would laugh it off and they realised it wouldn’t work,’ he says defiantly.

‘I did get upset, not because of what they were saying but why they were saying it.

‘Why were they trying to hurt me? It made me think they didn’t like me. That’s what I couldn’t understand; I wouldn’t want to deliberately upset someone.’

He insists he was never embarrassed about how his parents made their living: it’s all he ever knew. ‘They were always very open with me,’ he says.

But things did get a bit embarrassing when his parents found him watching porn when he was 14 — he says he’d first found it on the internet after typing in ‘boobs’ when he was ‘eight or nine’. ‘There was no shouting or anything like that, but my dad was worried that I would find something with him in it,’ he says. 

He was forced to leave his private school after his GCSEs when his parents divorced after 30 years together, and suddenly the money — which had been dwindling due to the rise of free porn on the internet — ran out. He could have paid for the school fees ­himself with his earnings from Outnumbered, but preferred to save his money and taught himself his A-Levels in French, Spanish and psychology, while living in a small, rented house with his mother.

He admits that until he made the new documentary — which features him interviewing his parents — he saw pornography only as harmless fun. It was a world he grew up in and his father, whose home is full of porn awards and sex toys, talks openly about it.

But looking at the subject with an objective film-maker’s eye, and meeting young men addicted to porn and seeing how it affects all of today’s teenagers, has led to a Damascene-style conversion.

‘When it comes to porn, the internet has changed everything,’ he says. ‘You used to have to go to a shop and buy a DVD if you wanted to watch anything like that. But now all you have to do is type some words into Google and it’s all there for you — and it’s free.

‘There are not enough ­barriers to stop really young kids watching it.

‘It replaces sex education and there is a whole generation who are growing up with a really warped view about what sex should be about. It feels like this generation is an accident waiting to happen because of our easy access to porn from such a young age.’

What hit Tyger hardest about the dangers of sex films on the internet was when he interviewed a teenage girl whose boyfriend had become hooked on watching rape scenes on porn sites and then started acting out his fantasies without her consent.

‘She was traumatised, and it showed me that porn can ruin lives if it’s not used properly,’ he recalls. ‘It was a massive eye-opener. She was raped repeatedly by her boyfriend, but the interesting thing is she didn’t seem to have any real resentment towards him; she saw them both as victims of pornography.’

Tyger played the role of Jake in Outnumbered and still sees his on-screen siblings Daniel Roche and Romona Marquez

There is, indeed, a lot to worry about when it comes to the mental health of our teenagers.

But as his critical judgments on the porn industry suggest, Tyger seems a well-balanced and thoughtful young man.

He’s been in the public eye since winning the role of Jake in Outnumbered when he was 12 after being spotted during a school production of ­Treasure Island. The show ended earlier this year, mainly because Tyger and his on-screen siblings are now teenagers rather than cute kids saying funny little things.

‘I’m sad Outnumbered has come to an end, but it’s not the kind of sadness where I wish it had kept on going,’ he says. ‘When something is ready to finish — and this was — it would be detrimental to keep flogging it.

‘It’s given me a brilliant start to my career, but I’m grown up now and this is my next venture. I feel like I’ve got interesting things to say and I would love to do more documentaries as well as carrying on acting.’

He still sees his on-screen siblings, Daniel Roche, 14, and Ramona Marquez, 13, who were the closest thing he’s ever had to a real brother and sister.

He’s funny in an older-brother way when he talks about them. ‘We are close but our different ages makes it hard for us to do things together,’ Tyger says. ‘Ramona is hitting puberty, going to concerts and kissing boys and it’s weird, because that’s not a world I’m into any more. You don’t realise how 13-year-old-ish a 13-year-old is until they reach that age.’ He sighs.

‘When they were younger, I was more like a big brother and they were cute, but now they have become their own people and are very intelligent and argue with me.

‘We get invited to functions together, such as the fifth anniversary of the musical Wicked, and that’s always fun; but if we try to make our own arrangements it’s hard, because Ramona is sitting exams and Dan’s ­normally playing rugby.’

Tyger, meanwhile, is having to adjust to a life of no school and no Outnumbered. Later this year, after a spate of auditions for his next project, he wants to travel and have a period of not working, for the first time since he was 12. He is planning to spend time in France getting to grips with the language.

‘To me, language is the most  fascinating thing in the world,’ he says. ‘I love the way ­languages can mean the same thing but don’t translate ­completely into each other. If I never acted again, I would love to be a translator.’

It’s still hard being a teenager, but Tyger seems to be coping pretty well. ‘The most important thing is to be happy with who you are,’ he says. ‘And I am.’

Tyger On . . . begins on BBC3 on May 15 at 9pm.
