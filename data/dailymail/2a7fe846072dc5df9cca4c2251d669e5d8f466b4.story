Andy Murray’s eyes blazed with furious intensity. He glanced up towards the familiar faces that have long accompanied him on these journeys to gladiatorial extremes.

‘Don’t worry about him,’ he muttered. ‘He does this all the time.’ Indeed he does. Novak Djokovic wins the Australian Open all the time. He beats Murray all the time, too; certainly of late. These qualities, combined in Melbourne, became close to irresistible. So Murray was right. Djokovic does this all the time. What does he do? He does Murray. Like a kipper.

If this felt different to those other occasions it was because a third Grand Slam title was within Murray’s grasp. That may sound strange, considering he lost the fourth and final set 6-0.

Yet Murray was serving to go 5-2 up in the first set tie-break, he won the second set and was a break up in the third. He failed, he said, because he became distracted. And what distracted him?

That thing Djokovic does all the time. He was referring to a spell in the third set when his opponent gave every indication of being on his last legs. He limped, he grimaced in pain, he fell awkwardly after a couple of points, almost as if his knees had given way beneath him. It looked like a serious injury.

Murray said he was under the impression Djokovic was cramping. And he let that news affect his game. By the time he realised Djokovic was either a gifted thespian, or had powers of recovery that would make Lazarus look like a hypochondriac, the momentum had been snatched away.

Djokovic came roaring back, hence Murray’s urgent desire to refocus. It was too late. From appearing to be on the brink of conceding the match — in spirit, if not literally — Djokovic shed his woolly outer layer and bared his teeth. He won the last nine games of the match, straight, turning 3-3 into 6-3 in the third and winning the fourth set to love.

It is his fifth Australian Open title, bettered only by Roy Emerson. Murray, meanwhile, claimed not to be greatly distressed by the bagel. It was the third set that troubled him.

‘In the fourth he was ripping everything, going for everything and it was going in,’ he said. ‘He got a break up and just let loose. The third was more frustrating. I got distracted. I let what was happening at the other end bother me.’

This may seem a strange explanation. What, after all, is so bad about being a break up and feeling your opponent was about to capitulate? Well, exactly that. Murray said he started feeling too good about the way the match was going and for 10 minutes his focus dropped. ‘Maybe the occasion had something to do with it,’ he added.

In a nutshell, he fancied his chances of at last landing this prize after three losing final appearances. He let himself get sucked in and by the time the real Djokovic showed himself, Murray had settled into a complacent groove.

It was his fault. He has played in enough matches not to surrender concentration and has indeed been accused of a similar tactic by rivals, exaggerating injuries or discomfort to encourage a false sense of security.

Within reason, there are no rules against it. Djokovic didn’t exactly take a dive and if Murray was mentally preparing his winner’s speech when he should have been staring down the No 1 player in the world, that is a tactical blunder of grand proportions.

He will know better next time. And there is bound to be a next time. What cannot be ignored, amid the disappointment, is how far Murray has come since back surgery last year. If he ran out of resistance here, it was probably because the first three sets had taken three hours and 12 minutes to complete, and Djokovic was making his usual demands, physical and mental.

The baseline rallies were quite immense. The difference between the elite quartet that dominate modern tennis, and the bulk of the field, can be measured in time. It might take three or four returns to gain a point from Tomas Berdych or Marin Cilic. Djokovic insists on greater investment.

He uses the initial flurry of returns to get his range. Then he beds in. Epic slugfests are required just to secure a lousy 15-all. The first set took close to one-and-a-quarter hours to complete. The second was longer. Both went to tiebreaks, and Murray’s regrets will begin there. He raced into a 4-2 lead in the first, and was serving to secure a three-point advantage. What a time to record his first double fault of the match.

A lengthy rally then ended with Murray hitting the net and he was long for the next point. From serving to lead 5-2, he was now 5-4 down. The shot that surrendered the set — 7-5 in the tie-break — was a tame return from Djokovic’s second serve. Murray had got into a winning position but had failed to win; against incredible competitors like Djokovic, such profligacy rarely goes unpunished.

Yet, first, the revival. Murray took the second set after another mighty struggle that at one stage saw Djokovic win 13 consecutive points.

Djokovic saved a set point with the score at 5-4 and just when Murray had four set points in the tie-break he hit arguably his poorest shot of the day, long with the court wide open, having manoeuvred his opponent into no man’s land.

He recovered and closed it out 7-4 but the next 39 minutes decided the match. Murray began the third set by breaking Djokovic’s serve but then fell under his spell. Djokovic sprinted to the net but fell over and he later appeared to stumble forward as if afforded no balance when he served. Yet, reviewing the match, there were clues that this might be a temporary condition.

Djokovic’s passing shot to secure his first point of the set was so magnificent, Murray exclaimed ‘oh no’. When he broke back to level the score at 2-2, Murray was so unnerved he struck a ball high through the gap in the open roof of Rod Laver Arena.

With the scores tied at 3-3, Murray earned a break point with an exquisite forehand pass. Djokovic saw saving that game — he played a neat drop shot at the net to take it to deuce — as the turning point of the match. He won every game from there and soon Murray was striking the ground with his racket in frustration.

Naturally, Djokovic’s explanation for his revival was considerably more innocent than Murray’s claim that he was hoodwinked.

‘At the start of the third set, I was in trouble,’ he said. ‘I needed to regroup and get back on track. I started coming to the net more, shortening the points, because I was exhausted. I had no reason to call a time-out because I was not injured, but I just felt weak. I had a physical crisis. The first two sets had taken the energy from me.

‘I haven’t felt like that too many times in my career. There was a lot of emotion, a lot of tension, but it was a Grand Slam and I wasn’t going to give up. When we played in 2013 it was a similar match, very long from the start, and I felt I had the physical edge over him so I used that memory.

‘I had to earn the right to win and the willpower got me to where I am now. I think in these matches the mental strength plays the most important role. There are a lot of things that can influence your state of mind when you are down — but I wasn’t aware that Andy got distracted.’

Put like that, so succinctly and simply, it is hard to dispute Djokovic’s version of events. He was exhausted by a quite superb game of tennis — he also caught a virus during a recent tournament in Doha which may have left its mark — but dug deep and recovered.

The final set was extraordinary. In both his semi-final against Stanislas Wawrinka and against Murray in the final, Djokovic has claimed victory with a 6-0 finish. Breaking Murray for the second time, to take the score to 3-0, Djokovic lifted his racket as if giving the arena permission to begin their celebrations.

The job duly completed soon after, Murray shook hands, returned to his chair and stared straight ahead. ‘Don’t worry about him, he does this all the time,’ he may have reasoned; but it will have been scant consolation in the circumstances.
