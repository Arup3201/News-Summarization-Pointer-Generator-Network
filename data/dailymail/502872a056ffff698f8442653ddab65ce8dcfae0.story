You may not be familiar with the name Henry Hate but you will definitely have seen his designs.

The tattooist to the stars has inked the likes of Amy Winehouse, Alexander McQueen, Boy George and Franz Ferdinand.

And now Hate has collaborated with renowned shoe designer Oliver Sweeney to produce a range of bespoke £995 lace-ups.

The British shoe house and VeryFirstTo.com (the website allowing users to be the first to know about any new luxury launches) have commissioned Hate to tattoo personal imagery on shoe chosen by the customer, all accompanied by a certificate of authentication.

From boots to brogues the design will feature on the upper sole, hand rendered by Hate using just his trusty tattoo gun and inks.

On the venture Hate commented: ‘I’m keen to be injecting some fresh attitude, creativity and originality into men’s footwear. Oliver Sweeney shoes are an unexpected, but stunning canvass to deliver my work on.’

A donation of £50 from the sale of each pair of shoes purchased will be donated to The Amy Winehouse Foundation.
