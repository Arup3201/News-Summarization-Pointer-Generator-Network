It may have been one of the greatest fashion trends of the 80s but Bill Shorten has proved that the controversial mullet hairstyle  does not belong in Parliament.

The Opposition leader was pictured in a rather unfortunate stance today on his way into Parliament, making him look like he was sporting an unsightly mullet.

A journalist who was standing behind Shorten just happened to align exactly with the politician, leading Twitter users to believe the Labor Leader had grown out his locks.
