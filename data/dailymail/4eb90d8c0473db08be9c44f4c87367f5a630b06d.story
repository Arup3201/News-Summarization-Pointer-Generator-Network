Ed Miliband congratulates John Denham on his speech at the 2010 Labour conference - the two no longer see eye-to eye

Ed Miliband has secretly admitted he may lose the Election because voters oppose his stance on immigration, public spending and welfare benefits.

A Labour document obtained by The Mail on Sunday suggests that he has also given up hope of winning over new supporters.

Instead he is pinning his hopes on ‘shoring up’ Labour’s traditional working-class vote and declaring his own class war by smearing the ‘toxic Tories’ as rich and out of touch.

The damaging disclosures are contained in a leaked copy of Labour’s General Election strategy sent to all Labour shadow cabinet ministers.

Headed Political Strategy To 2015, it sets out how Mr Miliband plans to win power. But it also confirms claims by Labour MPs that the party faces an uphill struggle because voters find Mr Miliband and his views a big turn-off.

One shadow minister said: ‘This document admits the awful truth that nearly four years after Ed became leader, people don’t trust him on the three things that worry them most: immigration, the economy and welfare. We aren’t even bothering to  try to appeal to the majority of people. It is a counsel of despair.’

Mr Miliband’s secret plan is revealed under the heading The Political Context Underpinning Our Strategy. It says the top three issues that would-be Labour voters care about are ‘economy, immigration and the NHS’ – and Labour’s ‘weaknesses are immigration, social security and [public] spending’.

The document also makes a  mockery of Mr Miliband’s public denials that he has given up trying to win over Middle England voters who helped Tony Blair’s landslide win in 1997 and hopes to scrape  into power by appealing only to the Labour faithful, about 35 per cent  of the public.

Confirming Mr Miliband’s secret so-called ‘35 per cent strategy’, it states: ‘Our solid lead in the national vote share, 35 per cent, is reflected in a solid lead in battleground seats, 37 per cent. This would give us a majority of 44 at the elections. To shore up our position, we want to gain an additional 3-5 per cent of the vote.’Tony Blair won the 1997 Election with 43 per cent of the vote.

Ed Miliband faced fresh pressure last night after one of his closest allies warned that he was failing to win over voters.

Labour MP John Denham – an ex-Cabinet minister who helped Mr Miliband win the party leadership before serving as his Parliamentary aide – warned voters ‘do not believe that they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country’.

Devastatingly Mr Denham added: ‘If they are not part of our story, I don’t know what the Labour Party is for.’

His outspoken remarks form part of a growing chorus of dissent over the direction of Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Mr Denham backed Rachel Reeves (right) – Labour’s work and pensions spokesman who warned earlier this month that the party was being deserted by its traditional supporters in favour of UKIP because Labour was taking them ‘for granted’. 

He told a political seminar: ‘If you went to many of the people that Rachel brilliantly described, they don’t believe that they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country. They can list lots of other people that they think are in Labour’s story, but not them.’

Mr Denham went on: ‘It’s not a matter of having a policy for this or for that, but actually including them legitimately in the story and saying you are part of the people that we’re here for. If they’re not part of our story I don’t know what the Labour Party is for.’

Yesterday, former Labour Cabinet Minister David Blunkett, who is standing down in 2015, warned the party would be out of power until 2030 if Mr Miliband loses the Election because the Conservatives would bring in changes to exclude Labour.

A Blairite Labour MP said: ‘The language in this document is shocking. To talk of shoring up our vote underlines the extent of our crumbling support.

'Miliband says he is a One Nation leader while admitting he is only seeking the support of a third of the nation.

'Nor should he be talking about toxifying the Tories. We don’t need to resort to smears, we need constructive popular policies if we want to win and win well. It’s hopeless, we can’t go on like this.’ 

The Labour document, written before the recent European and local elections, also states: ‘Our target voters care about: 1) immigration; 2) NHS and 3) growth.

When growth is bundled with other economic issues, the priorities in order of importance to these voters are: Economy; Immigration; NHS.

‘The Tories will try to frame  the Election in terms of our  weaknesses: immigration, borrowing and benefits.’ 

The document says Labour’s tactics must be to ‘neutralise our weaknesses on immigration, social security and spending’.

Mr Miliband pledged last week to boost benefits for older jobless while scrapping them for young adults in middle-class families. The Tories claimed it would push up welfare bills.

The document also says Labour must ‘toxify more of the same under the Tories’, focusing on the ‘living standards crisis, youth unemployment, NHS in crisis and “the top running away with it” ’, a reference to Labour claims that the Prime Minister and Chancellor help only the rich.

The Conservatives said the Labour document was ‘an admission that they have lost the argument and are resorting to lies’. 

A Labour source said: ‘Ed is an effective campaigner and we have popular policies, including a freeze on energy bills, a guaranteed appointment with your GP and moves to get 200,000 homes built every year. We are in a position to win next May.’
