Homes in Blackpool have been rocked by two earthquakes beneath the Irish Sea.

The British Geological Survey, which collected data on the quakes, said the strongest had a magnitude of 3.3 on the Richter Scale at a depth of three miles. It was recorded just before 10am.

An earlier quake at around 5.30am measured 2.4.

The
Irish National Seismic Network (INSN) said the quakes were probably caused 
by stresses built up from the weight of glaciers covering land during 
the Ice Age.

INSN director 
Tom Blake said it was unusual that the earthquakes - measuring 2.4 and 
then a stronger 3.3 on the Richter scale - happened in the Irish Sea.

Glen
Ford from the British Geological Survey said it could have been ‘quite 
alarming’ and added: ‘Not many people experience earthquakes in the UK. 
There are only two or three of them a year of that size.’

Last year it was suggested that fracking tests in the region had caused tremors in Blackpool.

'It is impossible to tell if stronger earthquakes will occur in the coming days and weeks, but aftershocks can be expected even if most, if not all, will be too weak to be felt,' Mr Blake said.

Social media users took to Twitter saying they felt the ground move beneath them - particularly in the north west of England.

Twitter user Cathy Welsh, said: ‘The bed was shaking. I thought it was a big lorry going past.’

The strongest quake, at a depth of 5km, was recorded by the British Geological Survey shortly before 10am.

The earlier and smaller quake was recorded at around 5.30am.

Its epicentre was about 25km west of Fleetwood in Lancashire at a depth of 3km.

The larger earthquake was also recorded by INSN seismometers as far away as Donegal and Wexford in Ireland.

Mr Blake, from the School of Cosmic Physics in the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, said their cause was probably no different from other earthquakes in Britain and Ireland.

'Although Britain and Ireland are far from any plate boundaries, much of the region is still experiencing quakes due to the removal of the weight of ice sheets that once covered the land,' he said.

'Occasionally this post-glacial isostatic rebound - the phenomenon of the land surface gradually returning to its pre-glacial contours - results in earthquakes of this magnitude, particularly in the northern half of the islands.'

A slightly larger earthquake was recorded in the Irish Sea back in May, which was felt in parts of Ireland and North Wales.

The 3.8 magnitude tremor occurred 15km away from Abersoch in Gwynedd, Wales.

People as far away as Dublin, Wexford, Wicklow and Kildare claimed they felt it at the time.

According to the INSN, the largest known British earthquake struck near the Dogger Bank in the North Sea off the east coast of England in 1931, with a magnitude of 6.1.

The largest to impact Ireland occurred on the Llyn peninsula, North Wales, in July 1984.

The 5.4 magnitude earthquake was the largest ever recorded earthquake on mainland Britain and was felt throughout Ireland's east coast, Wales and England.

Aftershocks from the quake measured up to 4.3 on the Richter scale and some structural damage resulted along the east coast of Ireland.
