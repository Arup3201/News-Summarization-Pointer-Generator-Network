Detained: Bradley Manning is escorted from the courthouse in Maryland today

Defence attorneys for Bradley Manning, the young soldier accused of leaking government secrets, revealed today that Manning, a gay soldier in the era of ‘don't ask, don't tell,’ had an alter-ego named Breanna Manning.

In the pre-trial hearing, his lawyers claim gender identity disorder played a role in Manning’s mental and emotional problems that should have barred him from having access to sensitive material.

They said they found medical information about female hormone treatments in Manning’s room in Baghdad.

While prosecutors objected to the line of questioning, Manning’s military attorney Major Matthew Kemkes said Manning’s gender identity disorder and homosexuality was paramount, because it would show 'what was going on in my client’s mind.

Manning, 24, is accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive items to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.

The leaked secrets include Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 unarmed men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver.

The Obama administration says the released information has threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments.

Manning's lawyers argue that much of the information that was classified by the Pentagon posed no risk.

The military is conducting a hearing at an Army post outside Washington to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring Manning to trial, where he could face a term of life in prison as a traitor.

An intelligence officer who worked with Manning said today that the soldier was considered to have an especially high understanding of enemy threats in Iraq and had to be trusted to keep the material he saw private.

The description of Private Manning came at the beginning of the third day of the military hearing.

Captain Casey Fulton testified for the prosecution that Manning had a 'top secret' security clearance, enabling him to view a wide range of classified material. None of the material posted on WikiLeaks was classified higher than 'secret'.

Fulton said Manning was regarded as having a 
better understanding than other analysts of enemy threats in Iraq. She 
said analysts such as Manning, known as all-source analysts, were 
trained to gather intelligence from a wide array of
sources.

Fulton said analysts are trained not 
to disclose classified information and are not allowed to burn 
classified information onto CDs for personal use. But she said it was 
impossible to supervise them 100 per cent of the time.

'You have to trust that they'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught,' she said..

Accused: Bradley Manning, 24, is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in American history

Army criminal investigators described
 evidence they collected that links Manning to the WikiLeaks website's 
collection of U.S. military and diplomatic secrets.

Among the first issues to arise on Saturday was whether Manning's sexual orientation is relevant to the case against him.

The
 basis for the charges Manning faces are transcripts of online chats 
with a confidant-turned-government-informant in which Manning allegedly 
confesses his ties to WikiLeaks and also reveals he is gay.

Maj
 Kemkes asked Special Agent Toni Graham, an Army criminal investigator, 
whether she had talked to people who believed Manning was gay or found 
evidence among his belongings relating to gender-identity disorder.

The condition often is described as a mental diagnosis in which people believe they were born the wrong sex.

Graham said such questions were irrelevant to the investigation. 'We already knew before we arrived that Pfc. Manning was a homosexual,' Graham said.

Prosecutors objected several times to the questions. Kemkes responded that if the government can argue that Manning intended to leak secrets, 'what is going on in my client's mind is very important.'

During its cross examination of Graham, Manning's defense team also sought to convince the court that not all of the material he is accused of leaking is classified.

Graham, who collected evidence from Manning's living quarters and workplace, testified that among the items seized was a DVD marked 'secret' that contained a military video showing the 2007 incident in which Apache attack helicopters gunned down unarmed men in Iraq.

The video was taken from the 
cockpit of one the helicopters. WikiLeaks posted the video in April 
2010, sparking questions about the military's rules of engagement and whether more needed to be done to 
prevent civilian casualties. The gunners can be heard laughing and 
referring to the men as 'dead bastards.'

Kemkes, one of Manning's lawyers, 
asked Graham whether she knew the video was unclassified. She said she 
didn't. 'In fact, it was an unclassified video,' Kemkes said.

Although WikiLeaks had been 
posting sensitive information to the Web since 2006, release of the 
Apache video drew worldwide attention to the organization as it prepared
 to publish secret documents on the war in Afghanistan.

Manning's appearances Friday and 
Saturday in the Fort Meade courtroom mark the first time he has been 
seen in public after 19 months in detention.

The Oklahoma native comes to court in 
Army camouflage fatigues and wearing dark-rimmed glasses.

Slight and 
serious, he takes notes during the proceedings.

An Army appeals court on Friday 
rejected a defense effort to have the presiding officer, Lt. Col. Paul 
Almanza, because of alleged bias.

Separately, lawyers for WikiLeaks and 
founder Julian Assange are asking the military's highest appeals court 
to guarantee two seats in the Fort Meade courtroom.

Manning's hearing is open to the 
public, with limited seating. Inside the courtroom, no civilian 
recording equipment is allowed.

Instead of a judge, a presiding 
officer delivers a recommendation as to whether prosecutors have enough 
evidence to bring a suspect to trial.

A military commander then makes the final decision.

The case has spawned an 
international support network of people who believe the U.S. government 
has gone too far in seeking to punish Manning.

More than 100 people gathered 
outside Fort Meade for a march in support of Manning, some holding signs
 declaring 'Americans have the right to know,' 'Free Bradley Manning' and 'Blowing the whistle on war crimes is not a crime.'

Todd Anderson, 64, said he drove from New York City to take part.

'I think this man showed a great deal
 of courage, the kind of thing I wouldn't have the courage to do, and I 
really consider him to be a hero," Anderson said.

Juline Jordan, 46, said she flew in from Detroit just for the day.

'I support what he did because he 
exposed some horrific war crimes and horrific things done at the hands 
of the United States government and the Department of Defense, and he's a hero for that,' Ms Jordan said.

In London, several dozen 
protesters from gay organisations, the Occupy London protest camp and 
other groups rallied outside the U.S. Embassy Saturday calling for Manning's release and offering birthday wishes.
