If you live in the American Midwest or East Coast, you may want to hold off on putting away your winter gear.

Just as temperatures are beginning to warm in much of the U.S, another arctic blast in the form of a polar vortex appears to be on the horizon.

The upcoming front of icy temperatures is expected to bring arctic air to southern Canada and then move into the northern plains of the U.S. before moving to the Midwest and East Coast - each of which is still recovering from last week's frigid temperatures.

Many areas are still recovering from the extreme weather last week, which has caused a dam of ice to block the Delaware river in New Jersey, forcing roads to close and causing a severe flood risk.

A Coast Guard ice cutter has been called in to try to clear shipping lanes but after 2 and half miles the 2ft ice had become to thick to break up.

Chunks of ice have been building up for days near the Trenton Makes Bridge, ABC News reported. But with the sudden warm temperatures, it is feared a fast thaw will flood low-lying areas.

'If in fact the ice jam breaks then we'll have a rush of water which could cause flash flooding,' Qareeb Bashir, of Trenton Emergency Management, said.

Flash flood warnings are in place in several of the regions affected by the polar vortex, as rain falling on the already frozen ground is forced to run off.

Nearly all of Pennsylvania is under a flood warning after the sudden rise in temperatures caused a faster than usual thaw.

A chaotic scene of ice chunks could be seen stretching across the state's Susquehanna river near Harrisburg on Saturday morning.

But the thaw is likely to be halted by the new cold front coming in, even though it is not expected to be as severe as the one last week.

Frozen: Arctic air from last week's Polar Vortex caused many parts of the Great Lakes to freeze over

'Following the retreat of arctic air 
this weekend, waves of progressively colder will move southward over 
Canada next week,' AccuWeather.com Lead Long-Range Forecaster Paul 
Pastelok told AOL.com.

Forecasters
 expect the first stage of the new arctic blast to hit the northern 
plains by Monday, the lower Mississippi Valley and Midwest Tuesday and 
Wednesday then the East from Thursday.

Like the last bout of icy air, this one is the result of a portion of the polar vortex breaking away from the Arctic Circle.

'We will likely see a piece of the polar vortex break off and set up just north of the Great Lakes spanning Jan. 16 to 20,' Mr Pastelok said.

'This next main arctic blast will not rival, nor will be as extensive as the event this past week,' he continued.

Unlike the last push of cold air, weather experts expect temperatures to stay above zero in most locations in the Ohio Valley, central Appalachians, the northern Plains and the Upper Midwest.

Weather maps for the middle of next week show the polar vortex creeping back across the U.S.

North Central states and states in the interior Northeast, however, are expected to see temperatures at or below zero.

Additionally, anyone near the Great Lakes should also expect lake-effect snow.

Weather experts expect to have more information about the upcoming cold next week.
