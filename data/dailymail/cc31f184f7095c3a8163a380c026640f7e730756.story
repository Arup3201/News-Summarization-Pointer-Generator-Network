Americans are more skeptical of climate change than people in other leading countries, according to an international survey.

Global Trends 2014, a survey of more than 16,000 people in 20 countries, also revealed how divided Americans are over the cause and treatment of global warming.

When asked if climate change is largely man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking last in the international poll and ten points lower 
than the next lowest countries on the list, Britain and Australia.

However in China, 93 per cent of respondents believe the climate change we are witnessing is largely the result of human activity.

Disbelief: Just 57.3 percent of American respondents believe that we are headed for environmental disaster if we don't change our behavior or habits

The survey, conducted by British market research company Ipsos MORI, also found just 57.3 percent of Americans agreed that we're heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly.

This compares with 91.1 percent of Chinese and 84.2 percent of Italian respondents, who accept that behavioral and attitudinal change is needed to stem the effects of global warming.

Half of American interviewees believe the government is using climate change as a way to raise taxes, a view that is shared by the majority of respondents in nearly all the countries polled.

However, there appears to be global consensus on the role of companies in addressing climate change.

About 65 per cent of Americans surveyed don't think companies pay enough attention to the environment - second last among 20 nations surveyed.

Environmental Defense Fund spokeswoman Keith Gaby told CBS News that although American opinion is divided, other polls have found a large proportion believe some type of action is needed against global climate change.

'But it is true that a very loud minority has made action on climate change more difficult. I think that's because the issue - which should be judged on science - has gotten caught up in partisan politics,' he said.

'We need to [reopen] a productive, [bipartisan] dialogue about solutions that will help our environment and our economy.'

In April, an Associated Press-GfK poll found only 33 percent of Americans were extremely confident that global temperatures are rising due to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.

In Gallup's annual environmental poll, 42 percent of respondents said reports of climate change are exaggerated.

These views persist despite mounting evidence showing climate change is already affecting coastal flooding to global food supplies.

'Climate change is happening, the signs of it, the impacts, are detectible already,' Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, lead author of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.

'If you live in a city, if you live along the coast, or if you eat to live, this is a problem you have to worry about.'
