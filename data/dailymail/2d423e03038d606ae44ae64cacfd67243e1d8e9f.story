A serial shoplifter has been arrested for the 109th time, for allegedly snatching an armful of teeth-whitening products.

Prolific Nathaniel Ferguson, 49, was picked up by officers in the Cleveland, Ohio, suburb minutes after he allegedly grabbed the dental cosmetics from a CVS drug store and bolted through the open door. 

His latest arrest prompted South Euclid Police Department to quip: 'Does anyone have a contact at the Guinness Book of World Records?'

The career - if unsuccessful - criminal - has 108 prior arrests, as well as three active warrants with South Euclid Municipal Court and four other outstanding warrants.

Career criminal: Nathaniel Ferguson, 49, was this week arrested for the 109th time 

Petty thief: After he was picked up, officers found he also had seven outstanding warrants for his arrest

'I don’t have anything on me,' the 49-year-old shouted at a security guard as he darted out, authorities told the New York Daily News. 

But employees already know Ferguson well - he'd stolen from there in the past and is reportedly banned from all CVS stores - and immediately called police.

Officers arrived to find Ferguson taking off in a Green Mercury. They soon caught up and, as the vehicle pulled over, one watched Ferguson 'make several furtive movements as if hiding something under the driver's seat,' an arrest report says.

Questioned at the scene, Ferguson allegedly gave his brother's name. He was placed under arrest for the lie after another officer arrived who recognized his face. A search turned up $47.26-worth of CVS brand teeth whitening products, as well as two crack pipes. 

The items found corresponded to those reported stolen by the security guard at CVS.

'Probably the majority of his arrests are just like that,' Sergeant Mike O’Connor told the Daily News.

We've been here before: Ferguson's lengthy record means he has plenty of custody photos to share

Seasonal: That means we can see him in a range of outfits, including winter, left, and summer, right

Petty criminal: After his latest arrest, Ferguson was charged with stealing $47.26-worth of dental cosmetics

Drugs: Police also found two crack pipes that he admitted belong to him, the arrest record shows

Arrest records show Ferguson has given has given police no fewer than 26 aliases since he began his criminal career in 1984. Though they are mostly varied spellings of his name, they also include a few more inventive noms de crime such as Bruce Hogan and Nathan Hope.

But his efforts have been largely futile; there are by now few police officers or security guards who don't know him at a glance, police said.

As well as the three outstanding arrest warrants with South Euclid Municipal court, Ferguson was also wanted by the Highland Heights Police Department, the Cleveland Heights Police Department, the University Heights Police Department and the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office.

He was charged with theft, falsification, criminal trespass and possession of drug paraphernalia.
