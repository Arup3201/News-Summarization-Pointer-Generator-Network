President Barack Obama is
urging parents to get their children vaccinated in the face of a
measles outbreak that has infected more than 100 people in the
United States.

But New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who may run for Obama's job next year, insisted on Monday that moms and dads deserve 'some measure of choice' in the matter.

His press aides scrambled in the late morning hours to contain the political damage, trying to clarify and re-frame what he said while touring a biomedical company in Cambridge, England. 

In an interview taped Sunday before the Super Bown but aired on Monday's 'Today' show, Obama said measles was a preventable disease.

'I understand that there are families that in some cases are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,' he explained. 'The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. We've looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren't reasons to not.'

'You should get your kids vaccinated,' Obama added.

A MOMENT OF PAIN, A LIFETIME OF SECURITY: Vaccines protect against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Pertussis, and a host of other diseases that used to kill countless children

Christie, a likely Republican candidate for president, said Monday that parents should have some choice on whether to vaccinate their children.

Christie's comments came after touring the facilities of MedImmune, the manufacturer of the flu vaccine FluMist, during a three-day trade mission to the United Kingdom.

He said he and his wife had vaccinated their children, describing that decision as 'the best expression I can give you of my opinion.' 

Doing so is an 'important part of making sure we protect their health and the public health,' Christe added. 

'But it’s much more important, I think, what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official.'

'I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well. So that's the balance that the government has to decide.'

'It depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,' he said. 'And so I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns.'  

'Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I’m not misunderstood.'

Sensing a backlash, Christie's press office sent a statement to reporters on Monday morning insisting that he 'believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.'

'At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate,' the statement said.

All states currently require children to get certain vaccinations to enroll in school, although California and New Jersey are among 20 states that let parents opt out by obtaining personal belief waivers.

Parents in New Jersey seeking a medical exemption have to submit a written statement from their doctor or registered nurse indicating why the exemption is needed. 

Obama also talked with TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie about his legacy in office, 'deflategate' and the ISIS terror army

HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH? Disneyland in Anaheim, California si the epicenter of a measles outbreak which, so far, hasn't killed anyone

The MMR vaccine likely saves tens of thousands of lives each year

There have been 91 measles cases in California, with at
least 58 of those epidemiologically linked to a cluster that
began at Disneyland in December. More than a dozen other cases
have been confirmed in 13 other U.S. states and in Mexico.

No deaths have been reported in connection with the
outbreak, which public health officials suspect began when an
infected person from outside the United States visited
Disneyland in Anaheim, California, between Dec. 15 and Dec. 20.

The measles outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called
anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side
effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting
a link to autism, have led a small minority of parents to refuse
to allow their children to be inoculated.

Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated
for religious or other reasons.

Hollywood stars including Jenny McCarthy and Kristen Cavallari have urged parents to rethink vaccines, pointing to what they say is an increase in diagnosed cases of autism. 

McCarthy now insists she's not stritcly against vaccinations – but objects to the compressed schedule along with governments recommend they be applied. 

Obama said the larger the group of unvaccinated people, the
more vulnerable it made small infants and people who cannot get
vaccinations because of health issues.

Kristin Cavallari (right) believes 'there are very scary statistics out there regarding what is in vaccines and what they cause'; theories about a rise in autism diagnoses connected to childhood vaccinations have been widely debunked 

In thousands of cases each year, vaccinated children who are later treated with radiation for leukemia and other cancers find themselves lacking antibodies that fight off communicable diseases.

Those children can be at increased health risk if they are around others who haven't been vaccinated.  

The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, commonly called the MMR, is 97 percent effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

New Jersey requires MMR vaccines for children between 12 and 15 months, and then a second at between 4 and 6 years. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics says doctors should bring up the importance of vaccinations during visits, but should respect a parent's wishes unless there's a significant risk to the child.

'In general, pediatricians should avoid discharging patients from their practices solely because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child,' according to guidelines issued by the group.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through the air, with symptoms that include fever, runny nose and a blotchy rash. 

The current outbreak originated at Disney theme parks last month, and Mexico and at least six other U.S. states have recorded measles cases connected to Disneyland.
