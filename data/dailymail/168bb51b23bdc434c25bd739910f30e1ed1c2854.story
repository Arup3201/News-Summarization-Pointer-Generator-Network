Thousands of cash-strapped Britons have turned to eBay to save a few pounds - but not many can say that it has helped them to actually make a fortune.

Savvy mother of three Alison Abruneiras can though. She became the MD of a successful business grossing more than one million pounds a year after becoming addicted to the auction website.

Incredibly, the 46-year-old left school with no qualifications or business experience and only began her business as a hobby to distract her during treatment for cancer.

She was making just £70 a week as a nail technician until breast cancer forced her to stop working.

But after logging on to eBay in her bedroom at home as a fun ‘hobby’ to take her mind of the treatment, she’s become a hugely successful entrepreneur.

In six years, her cosmetic retail business, the Nail and Beauty Emporium, has grown to become a big hit on eBay.

It now trades worldwide and Alison has had to expand into a warehouse and take on four staff - including her 22-year-old daughter, Coralia, who is set to take over the business.

Alison, from Lincoln, said: ‘Looking back, It’s incredible to think that this all started at my computer in my bedroom.

‘It has been really hard work but I’d like to show other people that it can be done - if I can do it, anyone can.

‘Anyone can earn money. You don’t have to have an education, I don’t have a GCSE to my name.’

Selling is in the genes though and Alison has had an interest in business since childhood.

At 11 years old she was given a little market stall by her shopkeeper dad to sell washing up liquid and other small items.

But she never pursued her talent.

At the age of 21 she moved to Lanzarote, Spain, after falling in love with her now husband Amador, 47, and worked as a holiday rep and nail technician.

The couple had children Coralia, Amador, 21, and Luis, 15 before moving back to the UK in 2005 where Alison continued to work as a nail technician.

Three years ago Alison went from sole trader to a limited company and, today, business continues to boom - expanding to websites Amazon and Play.com

But at the age of 38 she was forced to give it up after being diagnosed with breast cancer.For the next two years she underwent agonising treatment - including a lumpectomy and mastectomy.

Her ovaries and lymph nodes were removed before she began a course of chemotherapy.

‘It was a huge shock to me,’ Alison said.

‘When you’re diagnosed with something like that it knocks you off your feet.

‘I lost a lot of my confidence and became incredibly depressed.’

With spare time on her hands, Alison turned her attention to eBay.

She said: ‘I didn’t want my whole world and life to be about cancer and chemo and that’s how I discovered eBay - I wanted a hobby.

‘I needed something to take me away from that hell, something to focus on - eBay, at the time, was my focus and it was exciting.’

She added: ‘I started by buying a foot spa from an end-of-line shop and seeing if I could sell it for a profit.

‘I bought it for £10 and within a week I’d sold it for £30.

‘I would be checking the internet every half an hour. Making that sale gave me that buzz and made me feel good. I didn’t think about whether I was going to die or whether the treatment was going to work.

‘Everything was a real whirlwind but building my business gave me a way of fighting cancer.

‘Then, when I’d finished the treatment, I was left with an empty void and I was wondering what I was going to do next.

At her three-bedroom rented home, you won't find designer clothes and flashy cars. In fact, the only luxuries Alison enjoys are family holidays

‘That’s when my business really took off, I put everything in to it after that.’

Boosted by her new-found sales talent, Alison used her expertise as a nail technician to expand into other cosmetic products.

She explained: ‘I bought £3000 worth of products from a wholesaler and stored them in my bedroom - which had become my office. Within two weeks I’d nearly sold all of that too.

‘From there it became an addiction - I’d be on the computer first thing in the morning and up until midnight.’

The business proved a real lifeline when husband Amador lost his job as a restaurant manager in 2010.Alison said: ‘My hobby suddenly became the only income and I knew we were going to have to make it a success to survive.

‘Amador started working with me and we worked together for two years. He put some really good things in place and we made it work.’

But, despite all her success, she remains incredibly grounded and lives a modest lifestyle.

At her three-bedroom rented home, you won’t find designer clothes and flashy cars.

In fact, the only luxuries Alison enjoys are family holidays to Florida and Egypt and a brand new camper van. She’s also treated Coralia to a new Mini as a reward for working so hard.

She said: ‘My daughter has taken a leaf out of my book - like me, she didn’t do very well at school and left with no qualifications.

‘But she’s proving a real whizz when it comes to business - everything she knows is self-taught. She’s amazing on social media and all the suppliers love her.’

Alison has now even set her sights on the hospitality industry and has opened a Spanish Tapas restaurant, called Ole Ole, next door to the family home.

Under the management of Amador, it’s also become a huge success in just five months - already rated fifth best of 335 restaurants in Lincoln on website TripAdvisor.

Alison added: ‘We have worked like crazy and life has completely changed but it’s changed for the better.’
