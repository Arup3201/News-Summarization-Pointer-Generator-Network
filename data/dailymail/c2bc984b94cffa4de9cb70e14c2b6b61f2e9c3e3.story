England were last night grappling with familiar back-line dilemmas after admitting that Luther Burrell is destined to miss the start of their autumn campaign.

Northampton centre Burrell is being assessed by his club after injuring a hand in the victory over the Ospreys on Saturday.

There are also injuries up front but more uncertainty in the backs, with Kyle Eastmond (ribs) and Marland Yarde (ankle) unable to train so far, and Owen Farrell short of game time.

‘Luther is seeing the specialist today,’ said head coach Stuart Lancaster. ‘He’s had a scan. He’s definitely not out of the series (but) I think it would be tight for New Zealand (Sat November 8).’

Lancaster has plenty to ponder at 10, 12 and 13. Eastmond and Brad Barritt appeared to be emerging as the preferred midfield partnership in the absence of Manu Tuilagi, but Billy Twelvetrees, Jonathan Joseph and Henry Slade are also in the mix, along with the possibility of lining up two fly-halves, George Ford and Farrell, side by side.

Meanwhile, England have had input from a former coach, Brian Ashton, the attacking guru who led the national team to the World Cup Final in 2007. ‘He’s someone who had a big influence on me as a coach,’ said Lancaster. ‘After the New Zealand tour we had a chat about the games and I invited him in to get his thoughts on what we’re doing. It’s not something that will be a regular occurrence. It’s good just to bounce ideas off him.’
