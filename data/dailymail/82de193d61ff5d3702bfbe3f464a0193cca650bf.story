Can turning 70 be a milestone to treasure? In a poll, one in three septuagenarians said they were ‘very happy’ with their lives, but only one in six of those in their 50s and 60s did. So is life more fun at 70? We asked three personalities.

I’m happy to be the butt of a joke

'I'M HAPPY TO BE THE BUTT OF A JOKE'

Sandra Howard, 73, is married to former Home Secretary Michael Howard and says she has never stopped trying to look her best

We have a well-worn saying in the family: ‘Doing a granny.’ My mother used to half-absorb some comment or observation and come out with it a few minutes later as a shiny new nugget of her own.

Or she’d pose a strange question such as: ‘Who was it who said “I’m a celebrity, get me out of here?”’ Something of that kind, and we’d fall about with laughter at her getting the wrong end of the stick.

I’m the one ‘doing a granny’ now. I’m never quite up on the latest pop star and usually mix them up with a cricketer or boxer, rather enjoying the fact that I end up being the butt of the joke.

But hitting my 70s hasn’t been anything like as bad as when I turned 50 or 60. Those significant birthdays were terribly depressing because there’s so much hype and expectation about reaching them. This decade, on the other hand, is without doubt the best.

We septuagenarians are keen to make the most of things while our health and marbles last, and that gives us a different kind of zest for life, one with more urgency.

And there’s a long list of pluses. We still worry about the children, of course — even if, in my case, you have one in their 50s — but the panic and guilt that used to consume us isn’t there any more.

I no longer worry endlessly as I did when our children Nicholas and Larissa were teenagers. I feared they might plummet down a cliff in their first cars or give in to every temptation crossing their path.

And the anxiety about parties! Once the children had one while we were away and set off the house alarms — it was when my husband Michael was Home Secretary.

The police came to see what was going on, but I managed to keep it secret from him. He would have been livid if he’d found out.

As for my appearance, I never stop trying to look my best — and splash out on any miracle cream going. But the pressure is off.

I can’t say I don’t feel jealous when some sleek, supple 30 or 40-year-old walks into the room — what I’d give for that glowing skin, the mane of hair, those toned, shapely legs.

But what the hell, I’m having a great time. My age feels irrelevant half the time. Plus, being in our 70s and with politics no longer the master of our time, Michael and I see more of friends, too — our desire to stay in touch is stronger than ever.

Best of all is feeling I can stop trying so hard. Nothing is such a burning, all-consuming issue any more. I can be eccentric, have forceful opinions and wear funky clothes, such as my emerald green skinny jeans.

I have the joy of grand- children. I love the way they and their parents humour me, and their mirth when I mix up their names. I’m pampered and properly indulged.

So, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn’t really turn the clock back — even if I could.

feeling healthy is a gift every day

'FEELING HEALTHY IS A GIFT EVERY DAY' 

Penny Vincenzi says she feels free to do what she likes now she's in her 70s despite having more family responsibilities

Well, let’s start with the good news. Because there is a lot of that. If I started with the bad — and there’s quite a bit — you might not read on.

First, in my eighth decade (golly!) I feel wonderfully free. Free to do what I like: free to say yes, I’d love to come out for dinner, go on holiday, go to the theatre, get involved in a local project, without a thought. Do things my way, go where I wish.

Of course, in my 70s I have responsibilities, not least to my family, which I do my best to meet. I have four daughters and eight grandchildren, whom I adore and see a lot of.

These are busy, happy, lovely times. Yet raising children isn’t my prime task any more. Now, as a grandmother, I appreciate the oft cited benefit of being able to hand them back.

There are other responsibilities, too. I always seem to have a book to finish writing, but then I count that as one of the good things in life. I consider myself incredibly lucky still to be working, producing something someone else wants. It’s gorgeous to have work to do that I enjoy so much. It accounts for a lot of my happiness.

Also, I can spoil myself — almost — without guilt. I buy nice clothes, get my hair coloured and my nails done — a new extravagance! And I have more time for myself, which is an incredible pleasure.

But there is a downside. Grief, loneliness and shock set in after Paul, my husband of 50 years, died at the beginning of my 70s.

It seemed to go on for ever, day after dark, empty day, however busy I managed to be.

And you never get over it. But you do get used to it because you have to.

As a very dear friend said, you mustn’t be seen to be endlessly miserable. Otherwise, no one, especially the young, will want to be with you.

The number of people in the world aged 60 and

older has doubled since 1980 and is forecast

to reach two billion by 2050

And like all of us, you don’t want to be a burden.

So you fake it, as best you can. And I have emerged much stronger, which is how I deal with the occasional lonely Sunday (easily the worst day of the week to be by yourself).

In my early 70s, I was ill with a rare blood disorder. It took several weeks in hospital to get over. But, in a strange way, it was almost worth it.

Feeling well again is a wonderful thing; it’s like being given a present every day.

So, the happiest decade? No, but it can still be very happy indeed. My father-in-law once said to me: ‘Penny, old age is hell.’ Well, it can be. But as I said at my most recent birthday party, it can be heaven, too.

no more fretting about tomorrow

'NO MORE FRETTING ABOUT TOMORROW' 

Gloria Hunniford says she preferred her 50s and has suddenly become more aware of her own mortality

I barely batted an eyelid when I turned 50 and then 60 — they were milestones I didn’t give too much thought about. But when my 70th birthday loomed, I admit I wasn’t looking forward to it at all.

The phrase my mother and grandmother used to describe the accepted time most of us are meant to live, three score years and ten, kept running through my head.

Times have changed, though, and I feel very lucky to have reached this age, happy and in good health — as so many older people are.

But something about the number 70 still felt unnerving.

I certainly don’t feel I’m in my 70s. Right now, I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been because I’ve switched to a sugar-free, low-carb diet after finding out I had high blood sugar.

But if I could wave a magic wand and go back to my 50s, I’d do it in a heartbeat.

Who wouldn’t take the chance to be younger again, with more of their life still ahead of them?

At this stage, I’m no longer planning for the next few decades. Rather, I’m following my father’s mantra and living one day at a time, something I’ve always been rather good at.

Suddenly, I’ve become much more aware of my own mortality.

When you start to lose friends and colleagues, as I have, it’s a stark reminder you won’t be here for ever. That is why it’s so important not to lose your lust for life.

I know that, for most people, hitting 70 marks the moment when they can look back on a life of hard work, put their feet up and relax. But not me.

I don’t want to slip into old age. I’m the kind of person who thrives on being busy and active — and the idea of losing that energy fills me with dread.

However, there are wonderful advantages to being this age. I no longer work every day and I cherish the freedom that gives me more time with loved ones.

I’m happily married for the second time, too, and my husband Stephen and I have ten grandchildren between us. Nothing brings us more joy than being so closely involved in their lives.

But this week I’ve started a new job as a panellist on Loose Women, and will be a contributor on a brand new BBC series, Home Away From Home.

I think that speaks volumes about my attitude.

So, I won’t be booking my ticket on a six-month cruise with all the other retired 70-somethings just yet — not while there is still so much more yet to be done.
