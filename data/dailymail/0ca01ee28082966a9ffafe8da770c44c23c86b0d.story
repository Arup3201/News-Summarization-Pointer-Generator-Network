Former US Congressman Mel Reynolds says he is in hiding in South Africa following his deportation from Zimbabwe because he believes his life is in danger.

He told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he believes he is being pursued by a secret Zimbabwean death squad because of information he has on American businessmen, especially from Chicago, who are doing business illegally with Zimbabwe.

He accused the regime of President Robert Mugabe of 'trumping up' pornography charges against him two weeks ago to discredit him.

He was arrested February 16 and after spending a few days in a Zimbabwean jail, the pornography charges were dropped on a technicality while he pleaded guilty to violating Zimbabwe's immigration laws.

Authorities say they found 100 videos and 2,000 images of naked women on his phone and laptop - including some depicting sex acts.

'There were no pornographic images on the phone that would be considered pornographic in any place other than Zimbabwe,' he told WLS-TV.

'That in and of itself is a ruse. If a picture of woman topless is pornography, then I plead the Fifth.'

After his arrest, he spent six days in a Zimbabwean jail under horrific conditions.

Reynolds was forced to resign in 1995 after he was convicted of statutory rape for his sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer

'Fifty people dressed in rags slept on concrete floors with no running water. Only one toilet that hadn't worked in four or five years. The stench was beyond your imagination,' he told the Chicago TV station.

He was released after paying a $100 fine and deported to South Africa on February 23.

Reynolds, a Democrat, spent two years in ten months in Congress representing a district in Chicago's southside suburbs from 1993 until 1995.

He was forced to resign after being convicted of child pornography and statutory rape for an illicit affair with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer. He had initially claimed that the charges were racially motivated.

He attempted to revitalize his political career by running for his old Congressional district in 2013 when Jesse Jackson Jr was forced out over charges he misused campaign funds.

He came in eighth in a crowded field - getting just 0.8 percent, less than 500 votes.
