When a commercial for East Hills Shopping Center appeared online last month, many viewers branded it the worst ever.

However an ad for Troy Restaurant in Staten Island may have taken the crown away after featuring a flying refrigerator, a talking chicken and a wooden dragon breathing fire.

Narrated by an actor with a poor grasp of English, the ad begins by asking diners: 'Do you ever wonder what your ancestors during the early ages or medieval era ate for lunch?'

Worst ever? Troy Restaurant in Staten Island may have taken the crown for worst advert ever after featuring dodgy special effects, a harpsichord soundtrack and a narrator who struggles to speak English

The commercial starts with an actor asking viewers to imagine what people ate in the past, before suggesting that dishes included 'raw meat, live fish and screaming bird' (pictured)

The actor then gives viewers a 60-second history lesson on ancient food, claiming dishes included 'raw meat, live fish and screaming bird', while reminding us that 'fridge was not invented yet.'

He invites watchers to the restaurant to try 'a few very interesting recipes' that have been 'adapted... to contemporary stomachs... using finest [sic] spices and open flame.'

Finally, he encourages diners to come to 'possibly the finest theme [sic] restaurant in New York' ending with the tag line: 'Simply said, the empire of taste.'

The video also features a harpsichord soundtrack and poor sound recording, which puts it into the running of 'worst advert ever' with a commercial for the East Hills Shopping Center.

The 30-second commercial  was posted on YouTube on Saturday and so far has over one million views after going viral.

The commercial starts with a little girl singing about back to school shopping at the center.

It then shows several of the mall's employees holding up various back to school items, while singing the name of the items out loud, often out of time and out of tune. 

The ad for Troy may take the crown away from East Hills Shopping Centre, which went viral last month with its back to school commercial

In the advert, shop owners from the mall sing about what parents can buy their children before they go back to school, singing the names of items despite often being out of time and out of tune

The mall's general manager Caroline Thalasinos spoke with NBC on Monday morning and said that the commercial was intended to be extremely 'lightheaded and funny.'

'It was extremely catchy and even though it was extremely funny, I knew a lot of people might take it seriously, and I mean, we had no idea that it was going to go viral but I knew that we were going to get attention for it and that’s what the main goal was,' she added.

Thalasinos told reporters it's too soon to tell if the commercial will boosts sales but it has certainly gotten the public's attention.
