Arsenal will discover on Monday the extent of an ankle injury Olivier Giroud sustained against Everton on Saturday.

The France international suffered the problem in the closing stages of the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park.

As is the case with ankle injuries, the Gunners medical team have waited 24 hours for the inflammation in the joint to subside before fully examining the problem.

Damage: Arsenal will find out how bad Olivier Giroud's injury is on Monday after the striker underwent a scan

Needed: Giroud is Arsenal's No 1 striker and is now a doubt for Wednesday's Champions League qualifier clash

Giroud is due to undergo a scan on Monday with the results of the procedure expected later on.

The club's No 1 striker is a doubt for Wednesday's crucial Champions League qualifier against Besiktas.

'It doesn't look too good. In the final minute, he stretched his ankle,' manager Arsene Wenger said on Saturday after the match.

His foot was in a boot following the clash against the Toffees, but he was walking unaided without crutches.

The Gunners are short of cover up front with Giroud and Yaya Sanogo both carrying injuries.

If Giroud is ruled out for a sustained period of time, the club's need to sign a striker will heighten.
