A Spring Break vacation in Florida ended in tragedy when a 62-year-old father of three fell to his death from a hotel balcony while chaperoning his daughter and her friends.

Thomas Saunders, a veteran American Airlines pilot from Southlake, Texas, was pronounced dead at the scene outside Holiday Inn Resort in Panama City Beach Wednesday.

Saunders' daughter Rachel Saunders and her four friends were sleeping in their hotel room when the 62-year-old man plummeted from a 12-story terrace.

Police do not suspect foul play. According to hotel management, the deadly fall was caused by a medical emergency and was not alcohol- or drug-related, the Star Telegram reported.

An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. 

Police were called to the hotel on Front Beach Road at around 9.30am Wednesday after getting reports about a balcony fall.

Mr Saunders' lifeless body was discovered on the roof of the atrium.

‘All I could see was the shape of a body under the cloth,’ hotel guest Andrew Rulesh told The News Herald. ‘But it was pretty disturbing.’

Panama City Beach Police Capt. Robert Clarkson said Saunders and his girlfriend were in town to keep an eye on his 18-year-old daughter, Rachel, and her friends.

According to his Facebook page, Mr Saunders, a graduate of Purdue University, spent 36 years flying commercial jets for American Airlines.

Under Federal Aviation Administration rules, Mr Saunders still had three years to go until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65.

Rachel Saunders, a student at St Teresa's Academy in Kansas City, Missouri, expressed her shock and heartbreak on her Twitter page.

'I can't believe this... It doesn't even feel real,' she tweeted just hours after the tragedy.

Cause of death: The management of the Florida hotel said the fall was related to a medical issue rather than alcohol or drugs

Later in the day, she added: 'I didn't know it was possible to feel this heartbroken.'

Mr Saunders and the spring breakers arrived in Panama City Beach last Sunday and were supposed to stay for a week.

On the first day of their vacation, his daughter posted several enthusiastic messages saying how much she loved the resort town, and she even shared a photo showing the ocean view from her room.

Besides Rachel, Mr Saunders is survived by two older daughters and at least two grandchildren.

In his free time, Saunders raced autocross cars as part of the Texas Region SCCA solo program.

World Racing League posted on their Facebook page Thursday that the 62-year-old was a 12-time SCCA solo national champion. 

'Always friendly and outgoing, always available to walk the course with novices or ride along with those looking to shave another 10th of a second, Tommy was one of those racers everyone liked and looked up to ,' the online tribute read.
