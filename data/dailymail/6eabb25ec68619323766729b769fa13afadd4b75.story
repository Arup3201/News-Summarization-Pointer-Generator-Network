Manchester City will win the Premier League again this season if all referees are as benevolent as Andre Marriner was at the Etihad Stadium.

Marriner appeared somehow to miss what can only be described as a flying karate kick by Eliaquim Mangala on Everton’s Samuel Eto’o as the City man jumped in for an aerial ball.

Sometimes players are defended when they catch opponents but there can be no excuse in this case - it should have been a red card.

Andre Marriner was extremely lenient and if City get referees like him all season they will win the title

After a delay, Marriner did show Mangala a yellow card, which should mean the FA cannot act on the clear video evidence.

Next came the champions’ penalty when James Milner and Phil Jagielka came together just inside the Everton penalty area.

Milner went to ground and was scrambling to get to his feet to continue playing when Marriner awarded the penalty.

In the second half, Fernando challenged Gareth Barry with his boot at head height and despite appearing to catch Barry, he escaped with a yellow card. If there was contact then he, too, should have been dismissed.

Marriner’s final act was to caution Everton’s Ross Barkley for simulation after he went down under a challenge from Frank Lampard - there was clear contact so the caution was wrong.

All in all, a bad day for the referee but a good one for Manchester City.
