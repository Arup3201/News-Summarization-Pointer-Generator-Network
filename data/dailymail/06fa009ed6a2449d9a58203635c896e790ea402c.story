A southwest Washington boy was pricked by a used syringe on Christmas morning after putting his hands in the pocket of a brand-new hoodie his mother bought him for Christmas.

The 16-year-old tried on the sweatshirt his mother bought him from a local Walmart store and withdrew his hand from the pocket with a needle stuck in his middle finger.

His mother, Nanette Snyder of Toutle, says she bought the sweatshirt at Longview Walmart.

Nasty surprise: One of these two syringes was uncapped inside the sweatshirt and both had traces of blood and other matter inside them

A second syringe was discovered in the pocket and both appeared to have traces of blood on them, according to the boy's stepfather, Tom Bayse.

'You do not expect on Christmas morning to be opening presents to find dirty, used needles in your Christmas present,' he told NWCN.

'I was just numb,' Snyder told The Chronicle.The couple took Snyder's son to the emergency department at St John Medical Center in Longview where he underwent HIV and hepatitis tests.

Horrified: The boy's stepfather Tom Basye says he won't be able to relax for six months until all the tests come back negative

The tests have not yet been finalized but even if initial tests are negative, the boy will have to be tested again at six weeks, 12 weeks and six months to confirm he is completely free of the diseases.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is possible to contract HIV from a needle-stick injury, though rare.

Snyder says she purchased the sweater brand new in November and has kept it wrapped and ready for Christmas ever since.

The family has filed an official complaint to Walmart in Longview over the incident.

Walmart's corporate spokesperson Betsy Harden says the company is investigating the family's claims.

'We take this very, very seriously and we want to get to a better idea of what could have happened,' she told the Chronicle, adding that the store has not received any other complaints about needles in the merchandise.

'Heâ€™s hanging in there, still pretty distraught about the whole situation,' Basye said of his stepson. 'Heâ€™ll feel better after all the blood work comes.'
