Thailand's police chief has insisted that the Burmese men held for the murder of two British tourists did not confess to the crimes under duress.

General Somyot Poompanmuang defended the arrest of the two Myanmar workers, saying that officials involved in the case had done a 'perfect job' - despite concerns the men had been tortured into making a confession.

The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, after being bludgeoned to death on September 15.

The suspects, who have been identified only as Saw Rim (left) and Win (right), both 21, have been charged with the murder of both Britons and the rape of Miss Witheridge

Last week, police said the Burmese men had admitted to killing the tourists and DNA found on Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.

Mr Miller died from drowning and blows to the head, while Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds.

The suspects, who have been identified only as Saw Rim and Win, both 21, have been charged with the murder of both Britons and the rape of Miss Witheridge.

If found guilty, they could face the death penalty.

'I insist that all officials in this case have done a good job. A perfect job,' the national police chief told a news conference in Bangkok.

But a lawyer contracted by Myanmar's embassy in Thailand to defend the suspects said the case was a 'set-up and not based on hard facts', according to the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent Myanmar news organisation based in Norway.

The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, (left) and David Miller (right), 24, were found on September 15. Autopsies showed that Miss Witheridge died from head wounds while Mr Miller suffered  blows to the head and drowned

'From what we have learned, there are inconsistencies with both the forensic report and evidence provided in the case,' the lawyer, Aung Myo Thant, was quoted as saying.

He was not available for comment. 

But Thai police stressed the importance of their DNA evidence.

'DNA found on the deceased's body matches the suspects,' said Police Major General Suwat Chaengyodsuk, the officer who led the investigation. 'This is something that cannot be denied.'

Police said a mobile phone belonging to Mr Miller was also found on Saw. A third Myanmar migrant worker is in police custody but has not been charged.

Some rights groups have voiced concern over accusations of abuse during the investigation.

Displaying little obvious emotion as they stood on the Koh Tao beach where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were found bludgeoned to death, the men gave officers detailed information of the killings

'A number of serious allegations of physical abuse against Myanmar workers as part of the questioning process in this murder case have been raised to us,' said Andy Hall, a rights activist and researcher based in Thailand.

'The accusations do not concern the two or three persons currently detained for the murder. 

'We do not have enough evidence or information at this stage to comment on how or if the two accused have been scapegoated for this crime or not.'

Migrant workers often face discrimination in Thailand and have been used as scapegoats for crimes before. But police denied using force during their interrogation.

'I confirm that there was no abuse of any of the suspects,' said lead investigator General Suwat. 

Last week, were paraded by police and used in a bizarre re-enactment of the crime on a Thai beach. They wore white motorcycle helmets and handcuffs for the reconstruction – a common practice in Thai murder cases.

The two Burmese bar workers said to have confessed to murdering Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were caught on CCTV riding a moped on Koh Tao on the night of the killing. It is not known which of the three they are

Crowds of onlookers watched as the two Burmese labourers replayed the murders, one holding a dustpan in place of the alleged weapon – a garden hoe. 

Police lieutenant general Decha Butrnamphech said: ‘I am very satisfied with the investigation.’ 

Two years ago, Thai police said they would stop public reconstructions of crimes using alleged perpetrators after complaints that they prejudiced trials – but they resumed after a few months. 

The reconstruction follows weeks of pressure on police to find the murderers of the British backpackers.

There has also been growing criticism over the standard of the investigation, from not sealing off the crime scene quickly enough to letting potential suspects leave the island. 

The killings have dented Thailand's image as a happy-go-lucky holiday paradise. 

They come after the tourism industry, which contributes almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product, was already battered by months of political protest, a May 22 coup and military rule.
