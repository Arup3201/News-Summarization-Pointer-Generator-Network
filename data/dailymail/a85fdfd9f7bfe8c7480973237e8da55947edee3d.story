Poking out from beneath a grassy verge, smoke puffing from a chimney… it could be a scene straight out of The Hobbit.

But this underground warren with its hand-carved oak furniture exists not in Middle Earth but in the back garden of a three-bedroom family house. 

It belongs to a pair of lucky children and was built by their play area designer father, Olly Wotherspoon.

Dig this: This underground den with hand-carved oak furniture was created by Olly Wotherspoon and his wife Tamsin for their children Sunni, left, and Noah. It was built in the back garden of the family's house in Bolton

Last night Mr Wotherspoon, 32, said it was memories of the farm he grew up on that inspired him to create the den with his wife Tamsin, 35, for their children Noah, six, and Sunni, three.

He said: ‘But we live in a normal semi-detached house on a busy road. So we thought let’s just do it and create something cool.’

The den is buried more than four feet into the ground but has 6ft 4in of head room inside. 

Because of its lack of height above ground, the creation has avoided planning restrictions. It took 14 days – and £4,000 – to build in the family’s back garden in Bolton.

Grand entrance: The warren is buried more than four feet into the ground but has 6ft 4in of head room inside

Cosy interior: It features a large sofa bed, a string of fairy lights, bright cushions and a log fire to keep it warm

Hidden: Noah emerges from a  tunnel that weaves through the hill the warren is set in to a second entrance

Inside is furniture sculpted by Mr Wotherspoon’s tree surgeon brother, with a large sofa bed nestled in the corner. The den is lit up with strings of fairy lights. 

A drainage system protects it from flooding and there is a log fire to keep it warm. An old porthole provides a sky light, as well as an escape hatch for the children. 

A tunnel weaves through the hill the warren is set in to a second entrance. It will feature in George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces tonight on Channel 4.

Now it is finished, it is a place the whole family can enjoy. 

Mr Wotherspoon said: ‘I wanted it for the kids now, but it will also be there when they’re older so they can go and play down there, smoke a cheeky cig with their mates and that sort of thing. 

‘And also somewhere my wife and I could go if we wanted to have our friends round and go down there for a glass of wine.’
