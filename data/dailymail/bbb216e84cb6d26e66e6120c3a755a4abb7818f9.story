New York City police officers have been caught posting pictures of themselves in full uniform on dating websites.

It is against NYPD regulations but it seems that hopeful bachelors cannot resist the temptation of showing off to prospective dates in their uniforms, posing next to patrol cars and motorcycles.

One 29-year-old officer with the name 'SandyManPete' posed up next to his bike, telling ladies that he likes rock music, snacks and 'girls with respect for themselves'.

In a statement to MailOnline today, John J. McCarthy, NYPD Deputy Commissioner, said: 'Members of the Police Department are prohibited from posting photographs of themselves in uniform without the prior authorization.

'This does not include photographs taken during official department ceremonies. This directive is in compliance with the New York City Social Media Policy and is in part intended to protect officers from divulging identifying information on social media sites that may endanger officer safety. 

'Members of the service found to be in violation of the order may be subject to disciplinary action.' 

In another profile, 'OfficerHassan', aged 28, says he's into women who are 'drama-free'. 

New York's Finest are not the only ones hoping to lure ladies with their heroic jobs.

Profiles for U.S. Marines and firemen have been spotted on dating sites with pictures in full uniform and on duty.
