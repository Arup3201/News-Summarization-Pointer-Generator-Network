Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has admitted finding it mentally tough to cope with his latest injury.

Sturridge has just signed a new contract worth £150,000 a week but has been out of action following the thigh injury he picked up during a training session with England – one that Liverpool contend he should not have taken part in.

The Anfield club have struggled without his pace up front and Sturridge took to Instagram today to confirm being on the sidelines was proving hard for him also.

Daniel Sturridge posted this picture on Instagram, along with a heartfelt message

The 25-year-old, who has not featured since the start of September, posted celebration pictures and wrote: ‘Can’t wait for these moments again… Winning games and scoring goals is the motto..

‘Don’t think people realise how hard it is mentally being injured.

‘I’ve had a lot of time to reflect. Can’t wait to be back!! Best feeling is to be playing football and I take it for granted when you’re fit.’
