A bungling burglar was caught thieving again after dropping his prison release papers during a break-in - on the day he was freed from jail.

Andrew Graham, 31, burgled a hair salon in Leicester stealing £5,500 worth of equipment and hair products and two mini iPads.

But he failed to get away with his when the salon owner found Graham’s prison papers, including his own photo, that the clownish con had left behind.

The salon owner turned up to work the next day to find extensive flood damage and disruption, with a sound system and electrical items strewn over the floor.

Thankfully his ID papers gave the police an instant lead and he was arrested two days later.

Leicester Crown Court heard that Graham, a drug addict, had 74 offences on his criminal record, and 45 were theft-related. When arrested he also tested positive for opiates.

And after pleading guilty to the salon burglary on June 25, and three other attempted burglaries on the same day, he was sent back to jail for 12 months.

Just hours before the burglary at the Ungaro salon he had been released from jail for burgling two commercial properties and a theft.

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'At the scene were Graham’s prison papers and other documents, including his photograph, which he may have dropped. The police had a lead straight away.

'Among the items taken were hairdryers, hair straighteners, scissors and accessories.'

Sentencing, Judge Lynn Tayton QC said: 'You were released from your last sentence on June 25 and immediately started burgling again.

'The most serious burglary was of the hairdresser’s shop in the course of which a substantial amount of damage was caused.

'I’m told that having been released from prison you resorted to substance misuse and in some way you wanted to go back to prison because you couldn’t cope, which was why you left behind papers so it would be easy for the police to trace you.

'If you keep coming back before the court the sentences will only get longer.'

During the hearing Graham also admitted a break-in at Lexington Packaging, in York Road, off Welford Road, which happened before his previous sentence, when more than £1,000 worth of property including a laptop, an MP3 player and clothing were stolen. His fingerprint was at the scene.

James Bide-Thomas, mitigating, said Graham’s previous convictions were mainly for shoplifting and handling and he only began committing commercial burglaries in 2013.

He said: 'He’s a man with mental health difficulties largely arising out of substance misuse.

'When he came out he wasn’t in a good place mentally and took solace in substances. The only explanation he gives for leaving details of his identity at the salon was he must have decided in his addled state that he wanted to go back to prison.'
