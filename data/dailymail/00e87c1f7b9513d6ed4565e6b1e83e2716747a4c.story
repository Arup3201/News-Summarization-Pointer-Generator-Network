After a long battle to compete with able-bodied athletes, South African double amputee Oscar Pistorius has qualified for the 2012 London Olympics and next month's world championships by smashing his 400m personal best.

Pistorious, known as 'Blade Runner' because he runs on carbon fibre prosthetic running blades, recorded a new personal best of 45.07 seconds for the 400m race in Lignano, Italy yesterday.Pistorius, 24, who had both legs amputated when he was just 11-months-old because of a congenital disorder, said: 'It was like a dream race.

'I just have not been able to sleep. I must have 300 messages congratulating me.

'I am sure tomorrow when I wake up it (the accomplishment) is going to hit me. It is really humbling to know I have gotten so much support from everyone.'

The winning performance means Pistorius has made history to become the first amputee sprinter to qualify for the world championships, which begin on August 27 in Daegu, South Korea.

A multiple Paralympic gold medalist, the South African had sought for years to compete in the world championships and Olympics.

Oscar Pistorius was born with congenital absence of the fibula in both legs.

When he was 11 months old, his legs were amputated halfway between his 
knees and ankles.

Congenital absence of the fibula is a 
congenital disorder where in one or both legs there is a fibrous band 
instead of the fibula.

The result tends to be a short deformed leg, an absence of part of the ankle joint, and what is left is unstable and the foot has a deformity, or an absence of part of the foot.

Sometimes the foot can be brought into normal function; sometimes it must be amputated.Â 

Pistorius's new time would have earned him fifth place in the men's 400m final in the 2008 Olympics and the runner was overwhelmed at his achievement.

'With 180 metres out, I just decided to set out for the end, and I really ran a very comfortable last 100 metres,' he said.

'It is kind of strange because I broke my personal best by half a second, which is ridiculous.'

Pistorius was born with a congenital absence of the fibula - the calf bone.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport gave him a chance to compete with able-bodied athletes in May 2008, when it ruled in his favour after a long legal battle with the International Association of Athletics Federations over the use of his running blades, which the IAAF said gave him an unfair advantage.

In January 2008 the IAAF claimed that Pistorious's blades 
required him to use 25 per cent less energy than his rivals to run at the same 
speed.

But the determined athlete argued that he was running at a disadvantage, with less blood in his body and no calf muscles, and Cas ruled he could compete with his blades.

But after the CAS decision, he failed to record a time inside the Olympic qualifying mark and missed the Beijing Games, although he won the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Beijing Paralympics.

The CAS stressed that any 
advancements in the prosthetic-limb technology used by Pistorius could 
be contested by the IAAF again.
