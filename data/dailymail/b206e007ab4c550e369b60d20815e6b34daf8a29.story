Is there a sweeter, more seductive sound than the opening of a new toy or gadget? Not to a select group of professional 'unboxers' and the millions of people who watch their videos on YouTube.

With the holidays nearly upon us and with them the start of the busiest shopping season, unboxing videos are more popular than ever, according to YouTube, which estimated that the video category received 57per cent more views this year than last.

For the uninitiated, unboxing is the recording and sharing of the big reveal of a newly-acquired item, whether it's Dad behind the camera on Christmas Day or a geek reviewer fawning for his tech-specific fans.

While not the most popular activity on the site, unboxing is up there and has enjoyed steady growth since such videos first surfaced, believed to be in 2006. 

The phenomenon covers everything from Happy Meals to gaming consoles, usually in minute detail accompanied by either great goofiness or hardcore earnestness - or both.

Unboxing videos feature a wide variety of subjects, including wide-eyed toddlers who have just discovered the surprise hidden inside a chocolate egg cracked open by disembodied hands, or eager consumers who love nothing more than ripping the plastic wrap off plug-ins and cables. Product reviewers young and older soak up advertising dollars through the unboxing of swag provided them by the makers of stuff.

And their allure has not been lost on brands looking to sell, sell, sell on social media. One in five consumers in a recent survey done by Google, which owns YouTube, said they've watched at least one unboxing video. As of mid-November, there were more than 20 million search results on YouTube for the keyword 'unboxing.'

'They're definitely integral to the way I buy things,' said 20-year-old Willy James, a YouTube fan from Pittsburgh who is particularly fond of user MKBHD (aka Marques Brownlee), one of the site’s top tech unboxers with nearly two million YouTube subscribers.

'They're therapeutic. My favorite is when they're doing the tablet reviews and they peel off the layer of plastic film on the glass. I check the unboxing videos before I check an actual company website,' he added.

While some might view unboxing as commercialism run amok, the unboxers themselves insist their videos are all about the emotion involved in the act of opening a new item.

'I'm doing this in spite of a great urgency within myself to rip this box open and get to my iPhone,' declares one unboxer who stretched his video – which even features the item’s packaging and shipping - to 18 minutes and 50 seconds.

He made sure to take his time to combine the experience with that of another YouTube phenom, ASMR, the video-sharing shorthand for the controversial autonomous sensory meridian response. It's a specific tingling in the body that cult followers believe is brought on by whispering and certain sounds shared in videos also intended to help people fall asleep.

'I wonder if the box sounds any different now that it's empty?' muses our soft-spoken sharer, with only his hands present on screen as he presses lightly on the tape-fringed flaps of his cardboard shipping box to create a scrape-crunch.

'You've got your full-time unboxers in search of a living, your companies looking to cash in and some professional comics looking for a laugh, but you've also got your random folk who want to freeze that special moment, said Matt McLernon, a Google spokesman.

'It's one of the larger trends on YouTube,' he said. 'You can unbox a cellphone, a vinyl record, a Happy Meal. It's not just over-the-top consumerism as much as it's feeling this connection with the thing that you're watching.'

Like most phenoms, unboxing videos have spawned a backlash.

'It even comes with an extra long twisty tie,' jokes one tongue-in-cheek parody video, complete with magical music. Posted in 2011, it has earned several thousand comments both pro and con on unboxing.

Lewis Hilsenteger, 29, in Toronto is the open-faced Everyman on the popular Unbox Therapy channel, which has more than 1.6 million subscribers. He said he was motivated to 'go pro' on unboxing nearly four years ago after becoming a fan of such videos.

Primarily tech-focused, his regularly posted videos on the channel have surpassed 211 million views, including a huge bump when he showed himself bending an iPhone 6 plus with his bare hands.

Before he hit it large on YouTube, the art school grad had a downtown shop where he repaired computers and mobile phones.

'If I'm not into it, there's no video. I have to be excited about it,' Mr Hilsenteger said, describing his audience as largely male between 18 and 40.

And then there was that time in March when he and his adorable son, who was 4 at the time, unboxed a giant Gummy Bear, with each chomping on an ear.

'The unboxing video sort of fits in between what a brand wants you to know about a product and what it will feel like for you to have it,' Mr Hilsenteger said. 'That's what I like about it. It's my reaction, which is impossible to fake.'
