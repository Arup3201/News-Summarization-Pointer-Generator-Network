A spectator at a motorbike race got a bit too close for comfort when he bagged a spot by the track - and nearly got flattened by a rider who had been thrown from his bike.

Ian Robinson was watching the Ulster Grand Prix at Deer's Leap, in Northern Ireland, when a rider called Bruce Anstey fell from his bike and rolled across the opposite side of the road.

His bike however continued to slide down the road, taking out rider Michael Sweeney who was flung through the air right where Mr Robinson was stood filming the dramatic action.

The spectator dropped the camera in surprise as he leapt to get out of the way leaving the lens pointing at a crowd of spectators who had chosen to view the race from a safer distance.

The accident meant that the race was halted in the first lap but fortunately there were no serious injuries.

Crash victim Bruce Anstey, from New Zealand, won the Isle of Man TT before taking part in the Ulster race. 

While the 45-year-old got off to a shaky start in this competition, he later went on to win the blue riband Superbike race at the same event. 

Smash! Spectator Ian Robinson caught this dramatic moment on camera when he bagged a spot by the side of the track at Ulster Grand Prix - and nearly got hit by the rider as he flew off his bike
