Britain is an 'old and declining empire' that is embarrassed about its standing, a Chinese newspaper owned by the ruling Communist Party has claimed.

The damning editorial was published after it was reported that the country's Prime Minister Li Keqiang had demanded an audience with the Queen.

The Global Times, a newspaper widely seen as the mouthpiece of the Beijing government, denounced the claim as a sign of British prejudice against the emerging economic giant.

The article criticising Britain emerged as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang continued his visit to London, including visiting the House of Lords

Mr Li met Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza in the River Room of the Houses of Parliament

Earlier the Chinese premier shared a platform with Chancellor George Osborne at the UK-China Financial Forum at Lancaster House, in London

The Global Times said: 'Chinese people should forgive Britain's confusing sentiment'

The Queen received the Chinese premier Li Keqiang and his wife at Windsor Castle yesterday after claims he demanded a meeting as part of his official visit. But a Chinese newspaper owned by the Communist regime said the 'eccentric' claims were designed to mask Britain's embarrassment at being an 'old and declining empire'

The paper also accused the British media of 'hyping' concerns over China's human rights record and claimed it was time for a 'realistic recognition of the two countries' power' - with the UK no longer in the same league as China.

'Perhaps Chinese people should forgive Britain's confusing sentiment,' said the Global Times editorial. 

'A rising country should understand the embarrassment of an old declining empire and at times the eccentric acts it takes to hide such embarrassment. 

'Diplomacy has to be based on realistic recognition of the two countries' power. No matter for China or the UK, it will be tiring if they try to distort this reality.'

The Global Times said it was 'completely normal and proper' for the Chinese Premier to meet the Queen, and said that it was London, not Beijing, which 'conceives they could utilise different options to express its opinions'.

It added: 'British public opinion remains prejudiced against China and highly expects to embrace an opportunity to prove that it is superior compared with the emerging nation. Nevertheless, engaging in economic co-operation with Beijing is in its practical interests.

The Prime Minister has rolled out the red carpet for Mr Li during his three-day state visit amid hopes of closer economic ties between the two countries

'Whenever Chinese and British leaders meet with each other, the British media habitually hypes China's human rights and calls on the British Government not to sell its soul in exchange for Beijing's trade pacts.

'Britain's national strength cannot be placed in the same rank as China now, a truth difficult to accept for some Britons who want to stress their nobility. If they refuse to recognise this fact and find fault with China on purpose, even at the cost of bilateral relations, they will not find any mental comfort.'

Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman sought to shrug off the significance of the article, telling a Westminster media briefing: 'I read in The Times of London Premier Li's article when he said this was a great nation. That is the Prime Minister of China's view.' 

China's diplomatic clout has soared as its economy has boomed over the last 30 decades. Since 1980 it has seen economic growth of 10 per cent a year on average
