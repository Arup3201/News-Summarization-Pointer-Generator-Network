Hacked to death: Lt Col David Parkinson (right) was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja (left), in Kenya

A former Parachute Regiment colonel has been hacked to death by a gang of machete-wielding  robbers in Kenya.

Lt Col David Parkinson, a nature reserve manager, was attacked by five intruders as he was sleeping beside his wife of 35 years, Sonja.

It is understood the 58-year-old retired colonel died defending the mother of his two children, who managed to escape by fleeing to a secure ‘panic room’.

The distinguished soldier was formerly a director of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where Prince William spent his gap year as a 19-year-old and where he proposed to Kate Middleton nine years later.

Lt Col Parkinson, a former grammar school pupil from Brighton, was awarded an OBE at St James’ Palace by Prince Charles in 1998 for his military service.

The father of two was attacked at 2am yesterday in his home in the Lolldaiga Hills, a 49,000-acre wildlife ranch in the foothills of Mount Kenya.

There were unconfirmed reports that he may also have been shot, in addition to being attacked with broad-bladed machetes known as pangas.

Last night, Kenyan police said the retired soldier’s hand was cut off as he struggled with the intruders in order to give his wife enough time to reach safety.

Local police chief Maurice Tum said the robbers gained entry by smashing the windows and ordered Lt Col Parkinson to hand over money and guns.

He added: ‘A fight ensured between the men and the soldier and they cut off his left hand and left him bleeding profusely.

'The
 wife hid in the strong room. It was this decision which saved her. She 
came out and found her bleeding husband and contacted the police.’

Lt Col Parkinson, who served in the Army for 30 years, became manager of the ranch after leaving Lewa in 2008.

Before taking up his place at St Andrews University, Prince William spent his gap year at Lewa, helping with various conservation projects.

In 2010, he and Kate holidayed there, staying in a secluded rustic log cabin where William proposed.

The Duchess said: ‘He’s a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa. It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us.’

Last night the Duke of Cambridge, who is a patron of Lewa, said he was ‘saddened’ to hear about Lt Col Parkinson’s death.

Mrs Parkinson, who owns a local arts and crafts company called Mitumba Art, was taken to hospital and treated for shock.

A friend and neighbour said: ‘He was very
 dynamic, doing an amazing job in Lolldaiga for both conservation and 
the community. He was a very well-liked man.’

Lt Col Parkinson joined the Army in 1973 after graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.

Maurice Tum, local Kenyan police chief

Known to his fellow soldiers as Parky, he joined the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces, before becoming chief instructor at Sandhurst.

On his last tour before retiring, he commanded the British Army training organisation in Nairobi.

In 2003, he and his wife permanently relocated to Kenya where he took up his post with Lewa, a growing conservation and community development project.

The couple sold their home in Hassocks, West Sussex, for £500,000 three years later. They have two daughters, Anna, 33 and Renate, 29. Lt Col Parkinson took up the post with Lolldaiga Hills at the start of this year.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Kenya and our team at the High Commission in Nairobi are providing consular assistance.’
