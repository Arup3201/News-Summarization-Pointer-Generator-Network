A chilling archive belonging to an enthusiastic member of the Hitler Youth has emerged to highlight how the Nazis brainwashed youngsters.

Teenager Helmut Nieboy kept detailed diaries, records and maps during his time with the German equivalent of the Boy Scouts from 1933.

He also amassed a number of photographs showing youngsters who went on to fight and die for the Third Reich, sitting around a campfire, marching and at rallies.

He kept his Swastika-emblazoned tent and trumpet and his sinister 6ins bladed dagger, a far cry from a simple penknife the British Boy Scouts would have used.

The diaries include incredibly detailed maps showing route marches the young members were sent on as well as hand drawn portraits of the Fuhrer with patriotic slogans.

The journals also contain lists of fellow members and those who failed to graduate, their ultimate fate left ominously unrecorded with a single red line through their name.

The records are written in Helmut's neat handwriting and his fanaticism is clear, on one page he takes great care to write 'Heil Hitler'.

Helmut was one of 2.3million members of the Hitler Youth in 1933.

The paramilitary organisation was for boys aged 14 to 18 who were brainwashed into being part of Hitler's twisted idyll to build an Aryan super-race.

Members went on to become soldiers for the German military machine, with skilled fighters joining the Waffen SS.

During the war, the young members were drafted into the German Home Guard and then acted as the last line of the defence of Berlin in 1945.

After the war most Hitler Youth members were keen to hide their affiliation and so archives such as Helmut's are rare today.

His was recently unearthed in Germany but is now being sold at auction at Mullock's of Ludlow, Shropshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £4,000.

Richard Westwood-Brookes, from Mullock's, said: ‘This is a rare archive of material relating to the Hitler Youth.

‘The organisation was Third Reich's way of developing young men for their armed forces.

‘It was their equivalent of the Boy Scout movement and they did similar things but with an emphasis on Nazi ideology.

‘This archive is particularly interesting because of the detailed diaries kept in three volumes, the maps, photographs but also his possessions.

‘His tent, knife and trumpet are all among the collection that has remarkably stayed together.

‘Most similar archives would have been destroyed following the war as most people would want to erase evidence of their being in the Hitler Youth.

‘This youth was clearly committed and with his neat diaries and organisational skills I expect he had enjoyed promotion to the armed services by the time the war began.

‘Sadly, there is nothing to say what happened to Helmut.’

Also in the archive is a book of minutes and reports of the meetings of Helmut's group, notes of marching songs the boys sang and political discussions.

It also includes diplomas for his prowess in sport and an account of his attendance at one of the Nuremberg rallies.

The auction takes place on March 18.
