Arsene Wenger has revealed Arsenal have 'high expectations' for 17-year-old Gedion Zelalem, but admits the whizzkid won't be ready for first-team action for at least another six months.

Zelalem has already played at clubs in Germany, America and now England. His youth career started at Hertha Berlin, in the city where he was born, but he followed his family to the United States in 2006 and played for MSC United and Bethesda Soccer Club, before joining Olney Rangers.

The latter is where Arsenal picked him up from 12 months ago, aged 16, and in January he made his first-team debut in an FA Cup match against Coventry, making him the first player born after Wenger joined Arsenal to play for the club.

'I honestly think Gedion has the talent to become a great player, but that will be decided in the next two or three years because he has to show that he has the mental level required to be a top-level competitor,' said Wenger ahead of Arsenal's friendly against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday.

'He is a creative player and he can create a spark, an opening with his passing, his vision through the lines. If he manages to develop his physique and keep his qualities, he can be a very important player. Let's hope he will do it.

'I believe he is a very young, promising talent who was educated here [in the United States]. Today it is too early for him to play for us but I would say in one year we will know more about him. Maybe if it all goes well, in six months.

'Just now he is not ready to start in the Premier League, but he is with us and practises with us a lot and we have high expectations for him. He will play on Saturday.'

Zelalem, part of Arsenal's squad touring the United States also received praise from Gunners legend Thierry Henry, who he could face on Saturday.

'I know some of the younger players because I train with them sometimes, and they have a lot of quality,' he said. 'He's quality, good on the ball, great vision, everybody is talking about him, and he has the right boss.'
