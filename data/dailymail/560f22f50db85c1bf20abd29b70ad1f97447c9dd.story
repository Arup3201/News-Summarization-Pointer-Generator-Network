With its glorious garden, thatched roof and an out-of-the-way location in rural Hampshire, Home Farm Cottage couldn’t be further from the Hollywood Hills.

But this quintessentially English country cottage was once home to the acclaimed film director Ronald Neame who worked with names such as Noel  Coward, Alec Guinness and Judy Garland.

‘Not a lot happens here,’ says current owner Brian Morris of the sleepy hamlet of Quarley that includes just 60 homes, a Saxon church and a community hall.

‘It’s an 18-mile round trip to the nearest shop,’ he laughs.

Ronald Neame bought the house shortly after making his fortune on The Poseidon Adventure, so perhaps it was just the peace and quiet that he craved.

The director, who started his career as a runner at Elstree  studios at the age of 12, was the third choice to direct The Poseidon Adventure. Two earlier directors had walked off set leaving the production in a state of near collapse.

A disaster movie about a capsized luxury cruise liner whose passengers have to escape from the upside-down vessel, it was his biggest  commercial hit and made him more money than any of his other projects combined.

He had already directed Maggie Smith in The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie and collaborated on the screenplay of Brief Encounter.

Home Farm Cottage, once owned by the neighbouring farmer, was originally built in the 1500s. It was completely renovated and extended in 1971 and owned briefly by an Army officer and his wife before Ronald Neame bought it in 1972.

Brian’s neighbours, who have had a home in the village since the 1960s, recall that Neame appeared to have left his wife and would spend weekends there with his beautiful girlfriend and her sister, all arriving in his Mercedes. Tragically, his girlfriend was to become ill with cancer and died, leading a heartbroken Neame to sell the cottage in 1975 and move to Los Angeles where he lived until his death in 2010 at the age of 99.

‘He became quite integrated in village life, by all accounts,’ says Brian, 78.

‘He went round taking photographs of all the houses, which he printed and mounted for an exhibition in the community hall.

‘Presumably after his girlfriend died it was too sad for him to stay here and he moved to America. Had that not happened he would probably have stayed here a long time.’

Old school: The cottage has three bedrooms and still has many of the original features, such as the beans and a wood burning stove

Brian adds: ‘They had created a beautiful Italianate garden of rose trees. Sadly that had died off by the time we came to live here in the 1980s, but my wife was a keen gardener and planted the garden so that there is always something in bloom from March onwards.’ Brian, a retired insurance broker who used to commute from the cottage to the City, has lived in Home Farm Cottage for  26 years and is now selling up for £545,000.

He is moving to a retirement village in  Tunbridge Wells, following the death of his wife Valerie last year.

Amazingly, the same estate agent who sold him the property in 1987 is now selling it on his behalf. According to Mark Fry of Evans & Partridge, the area is still popular with commuters, attracted by the proximity to Andover station and the journey to Waterloo, which is just over an hour.

He says that prices in the area dropped down to 2006 levels after the housing bubble burst in 2008 and that the increase currently seen in the London area has yet to filter down to Hampshire.

‘It could be another couple of years before prices catch up, but things are certainly  getting a lot better. We’ve had a phenomenal summer of instructions and sales,’ he says.

The three-bedroom cottage has lots of original features including beams, an inglenook fireplace and a wood-burning stove that was once a bake oven used communally by the village at the beginning of the last century.

Brian says: ‘I have to admit, I have sat here by the stove and watched The Poseidon Adventure. It’s a cracker.’
