If things hadn't turned out quite so magical during a trip to the Home of Golf last October, this festive period would have been an agonising one for Oli Wilson.

The season of giving had been earmarked to talk honestly with his wife Lauren about what the sport had brutally stripped away - and what to do next.

'It was going to be the big moment, and whether I took a break from golf or even whether I stopped doing it altogether,' said the 34-year-old from Nottingham.

'My slump had gone on for so long it had got to the stage where I couldn't keep doing it. My results were terrible, I was playing with people on the Challenge Tour who didn't know I was quite good once who were thinking: "He's rubbish". It had become embarrassing.'

Now, thanks to his incredible victory at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, he's swapped all the negativity for rubbing shoulders with the Rorys, the Justins and the Henriks once more. Instead of contemplating another profession, he can pore over the European Tour schedule and pick the glamour places to play.

'Christmas will certainly have a different tone for Lauren and myself,' he said, smiling.

Remember Oli, the good guy who appeared to have the world at his feet? Back in 2008, he was good enough to be a member of Europe's Ryder Cup team. The following year he finished seventh in the Order of Merit.

How on earth could it go so badly wrong? But it did. Over the next four years his Race to Dubai ranking plummeted from 48th to 130th to 137th to 236th.

'The low point was last year in terms of the way I was playing,' he said. 'I was not coming close to making cuts on the Challenge Tour, never mind the main tour. I was snap-hooking it off the tee and it was horrific. I was reduced to hitting a driver off the deck because if I teed it up it went off the planet. Even hitting it in the rough was progress.'

What happened this year might have been mentally worse. 'I started to tee it up again because I knew there was no way back to the big stage if I didn't,' he said. 'I got my game back in OK shape but the transition of getting any confidence was horrible. My swing would look good on the video but on the course it was still rubbish.' 

That was when he put a big circle around Christmas as the time to decide whether it was worth carrying on. 'Part of it was financial,' he admitted. 'I'd made a bit of money during the good years but how long can you keep going when you're earning nothing and it's costing two grand a week to play?

'Basically, you're gambling on yourself and I'd lost that gamble for three years. How long was I prepared to keep on gambling?'

In September, Wilson was faced with the decision that would change his life. 'I'd got an invitation to play in the Alfred Dunhill Links, which was very nice of them, but I was genuinely in two minds as to whether to accept,' he said.

'I thought I might be better off sticking to the Challenge Tour and earning playing rights for the main tour that way. But I wasn't really enjoying the Challenge Tour, so why not play in a big event and give myself a shot of adrenaline? You can go on about the bad decisions you make and I certainly made plenty during my three poor years. But that was one of the best decisions I've ever made.'

Wilson arrived in Scotland greatly encouraged by some coaching advice from Robert Rock, who runs his own driving range in his spare time and loves teaching almost as much as he does playing. Even so, Wilson had no great expectations.

'If you'd offered me a top-30 finish I'd have bitten your hand off,' he said. 'Even when I led after the first round I was still thinking in terms of making the halfway cut. Then I led by three shots after three rounds and now I'm thinking a top-10 gets me into the field for Portugal the following week.'

How does a player who has fallen all the way to 792nd in the world keep all the demons at bay, with the golfing world now enthralled? His nearest challenger was none other than Rory McIlroy.

Halfway through the final round, the world No 1 crossed a fairway to talk to Oli and tell him he was rooting for him.

'That was so good of Rory, I think we all know he's a class act,' said Wilson. 'But it was all the struggles I'd been through that really helped down the stretch. For three years people had been telling me that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and, to be honest, I'd never believed it. But it was true during those last nine holes.'

At the 16th and 17th Wilson played two of the gutsiest shots struck all year. The man who had never won on tour, even during the good years when he amassed nine runner-up finishes, was on the brink.

There was still one more moment of agony, as fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood had a 12ft birdie putt on the 18th to tie. But when it slipped by all the emotion came pouring out. In the recorder's hut he hugged his wife and the tears fell freely.

Wilson admits he considered quitting golf but he is now looking forward to a bright future

It says everything about the popular Wilson that a sport rose to applaud as one. 'Mind you, I don't know what the guys on the Challenge Tour must have been thinking,' he said with a huge grin on his face.

As he says himself, in 72 fairytale holes, Wilson moved up about five levels. Instead of a visit to the qualifying school last month, he played in the four-event Final Series. Not only did the £500,000 first prize wipe out three years of debts, he can look to a future filled with possibility once more.

'I definitely feel capable of going further than I did,' he says. 'The standard has gone up massively in the three years I've been away. It's such an exciting time.'

None more so than for the man who thought he'd lost it all.
