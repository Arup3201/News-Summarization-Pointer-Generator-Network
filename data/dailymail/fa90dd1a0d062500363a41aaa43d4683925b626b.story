A university vice-chancellor has been accused of bringing his profession into disrepute after he was  pictured crowd-surfing at a boozy student awards bash.

Professor Nick Petford, who earns more than £200,000 a year in his role at the University of Northampton, was seen drinking heavily and having a dance-off with students.

Following his boozy antics, he has been dubbed the Wolf of Northampton – a  reference to Martin Scorsese’s hit film, The Wolf of Wall Street.

Egged on: Professor Petford, who earns more than £200,000 a year, seen here being encouraged to drink by comedian Lee Nelson

Boozy: After a three-course meal, Mr Nelson entertained the crowd of 400 and encouraged Prof Petford and Jane Bunce, the university's director of student and academic services, to down their drinks

Prof Petford, 53, had been attending the student union’s Stallions Sports Awards at Northampton Saints Rugby Club on March 20. He was among several senior staff who handed out awards to undergraduates.

After a three-course meal, comedian Lee Nelson entertained the crowd of 400 and encouraged Prof Petford and Jane Bunce, the university’s director of student and academic services, to drink glasses of wine.

He then had a dance competition with staff before being caught on camera crowd-surfing across a sea of students. But after images of the evening emerged on social media sites, a student body has called  for action to be taken against  Prof Petford.

Laddish: The Northampton branch of  the  University College Union (UCU) said the professor's 'irresponsible' actions 'promoted a laddish culture at the expense of Northampton's reputation'

The Northampton branch of the University College Union (UCU) said his ‘irresponsible’ actions ‘promoted a laddish culture at the expense of Northampton’s reputation’.

One student who attended the event said:  ‘Prof Petford was buying shots  for the students and joining in  with the Jagerbombs – he was  well up for it and having a  great time.

‘Most of us thought it was a bit of fun but you could tell some people were uncomfortable with his behaviour considering he is so senior.

Outrage: After images of the evening emerged on social media sites, a student body has called for action to be taken against Prof Petford

Joining in: Jane Bunce, Director of Student and Academic Services, was also carried over the heads of students

Rock and Roll: Ms Bunce is carried by the sea of laughing students

‘There are certain rules I imagine they must abide by when engaging with students and I’m not sure crowd-surfing is one of them.

‘I couldn’t believe it when he was carried across the room. It’s a pretty rock ’n’ roll thing to do for a man of his age.’

Prof Petford is believed to be in Hong Kong for a graduation ceremony and conference and was yesterday unavailable for comment.
