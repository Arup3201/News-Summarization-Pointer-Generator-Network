A group of fishermen dived into the sea and pulled a young woman to safety after her car plunged off a harbour wall in the early hours yesterday.

The 23-year-old was driving a white Ford Fiesta when it fell into the icy waters of Peterhead Harbour in north-east Scotland and started to sink.

Anglers who had been fishing nearby dived to the young woman’s rescue and managed to drag her back to shore before emergency services reached the scene.

Heroic early morning fishermen rescued the young driver of this car after it plunged into the sea at Peterhead

The woman was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a check up but is believed to have miraculously escaped serious injury.

The car, which is believed to have gone through metal railings before hitting the water, was later recovered from the harbour by crane after police divers secured a cable to it.

The early-morning drama took place at Peterhead harbour’s south breakwater, which is used as a pier for loading and unloading offshore supply vessels.

A police spokesman said: 'At about 5am, emergency services including police, ambulance and coastguard attended at the south breakwater of Peterhead Harbour following a report of a car going into the water.

'Members of the public had assisted in recovering a 23-year-old woman from the water.

'She was not injured but was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a precaution.

'As far as we aware she was the sole occupant of the car and inquiries are ongoing to establish how the car came to be in the water.'

After the woman was taken to hospital police divers went down and secured a cable to the sunken car

The dented Ford Fiesta was then hauled out of the harbour waters and onto dry land yesterday

Peterhead Harbour is a sheltered deep-water port which services the North Sea’s busy fishing business as well as the oil and gas industry.

The south breakwater has a six-inch kerb on one side and metal railings on the other, where the car entered the water.

A spokesman for the RNLI’s Peterhead lifeboat crew said: 'The lifeboat launched at 5.12am with its volunteers crew to help recover a casualty after her car plunged into the sea off the east side of Peterhead south breakwater.

'The casualty was successfully recovered to the breakwater prior to the arrival of the lifeboat.

Police divers recovered the badly damaged car by crane at the Scottish harbour yesterday

The car was recovered from the chilly waters of what is Scotland's easternmost point by crane yesterday

'After a search for debris the lifeboat returned to its berth at Peterhead Harbour at approximately 6.40am.

'The sea conditions off the breakwater were a three to six foot swell, and the wind was south by south-westerly force five to six.'

Members of the Peterhead coastguard team remained at the scene with the police to help with the recovery of the car.

Two days beforehand, a woman was rescued from Burghead Harbour in Moray after her Vauxhall Corsa plunged into the water.

She was taken to hospital in Elgin for a check up but did not suffer any serious injuries.
