A disabled man who suffers from cerebral palsy was refused entry to a Wetherspoon's pub because bouncers thought he was drunk.

Simon Pinner says he was turned away by door staff at the Banker's Draft pub in Bedford who told him he wasn't allowed in as he was walking 'funny' and his speech was slurred.

Due to his condition the supermarket worker suffers from balance and co-ordination problems and his speech is also affected.

Simon Pinner, who suffers from cerebral palsy, which affects his co-ordination and speech. He was turned away from his local Wetherspoon's pub because bouncers thought he was drunk 

The 45-year-old said the incident happened in front of a friend and that it has left him 'humiliated and upset'.

Mr Pinner of Bedford said: 'They said they couldn't let me in because I was walking funny.

'I explained to them at the time I had cerebral palsy but they didn't seem to take any notice.

'Everything I have built up over the years, like my confidence and self-belief, they have destroyed.'

Mr Pinner had been in the pub earlier in the evening with friends before he head off elsewhere to enjoy a meal with the group.

However, when he returned to the pub he found himself barred, even though he claims he had only had a few drinks and wasn't drunk.

He went back to the pub two days after the incident and the manager eventually apologised.

A spokesman for the chain said: 'We apologise to the gentleman if he felt he was unfairly treated.

Mr Pinner was turned away from the Banker's Draft in Bedford and the pub have now apologised for unfairly treating him 

'The door staff observed two men making their way towards the pub, both men were staggering.

'Based on the staggering and slurred speech when they approached the gentlemen were refused entry.'

He added that the door staff genuinely believed the men were intoxicated and said that at 'no point' was Mr Pinner's cerebral palsy mentioned.

Richard Hawkes, the chief executive of disability charity Scope says it is unfortunate that incidents such as these happen too often.

He explained: 'Not enough people know a disabled person, or know enough about disability.

'As a result, disabled people often experience negative attitudes, in the street, in shops, and in pubs and restaurants.

'It is really important that businesses take the time to train staff to support disabled customers - and come down hard on employees who openly discriminate.

'Hopefully Wetherspoon will use this as an opportunity to remind staff that disabled customers are as valuable to their business as any other customer.'
