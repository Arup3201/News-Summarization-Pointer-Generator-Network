A university student who was raped after being ‘turfed off’ the last bus home because she was 20p short of the fare, has revealed how she offered to pay the money next time she travelled with the company.

A harrowing police interview filmed days after the attack was shown to the jury today, in which the 22-year-old victim told officers she was left 'feeling depressed' after the bus driver refused to wait so she could withdraw extra money from a nearby cash dispenser.

Some
of the woman’s injuries -  bruising, swelling and cuts to her face - were
still clearly visible on the film, which was recorded 12 days after she
was attacked on December 10 last year.

The law student was left stranded in Nottingham city centre at 3am and after walking for less than a mile, the prosecution claim she was targeted by drink-fuelled Joseph Moran, 19, who then allegedly launched a ‘savage’ attack.

'Turfed off': The woman, 22, was said to have been thrown off the late-night bus in Nottingham because she was 20p short of the bus fare

Today it was revealed to the jury she also said to the driver that her mother could meet the bus at the end of her journey and hand the driver the missing 20p.

Both offers were refused by the driver.

Recalling how she felt about being stranded alone, the woman told police: 'I remember having a gross sense of injustice that he (the driver) wouldn’t let me on.'

The victim said: 'I was 
counting out how much money I had. I remember it being 20p short, it 
might have been more or a bit less than that.

'I remember having a conversation with the bus driver. I said I was ‘short’ and I said could I get on anyway and he said 'no.'

The victim said her last memory of the night was walking towards home alone.

She could recall nothing about the attack and her next memory was waking up in hospital about 8.30am the same day.

Attack: The woman was allegedly set upon and raped at Nottingham's Forest Recreation Ground

Michael Auty, prosecuting, told the court the 
woman 'was effectively turfed off the bus and left stranded in 
Nottingham city centre at 3am in the morning.'

She then called her mother who agreed to pick her up in the family car.

The
victim volunteered to walk a short distance to the edge of the city 
centre so her mother would not have to negotiate a one-way system she 
was unfamiliar with and to avoid driving on streets busy with late-night
revellers.

Nottingham Crown Court heard the victim was grabbed by the neck and dragged in to Nottingham’s Forest Recreation Ground where she was beaten and raped.

Her ‘substantial’ injuries included black eyes, a badly swollen face and bruises to her body, breasts and neck.

Mr Auty said the injuries were so 
severe that when her mother first saw her at hospital, she did not at 
first recognise her daughter.

Mr Auty described the attack as 'savage and almost devoid of any mercy.'

Mr
Auty told the jury that 'in the cruelest of circumstances' the mother 
had pulled up on a stretch of the road where she expected her daughter 
to be walking, and just yards from where she had been attacked.

Tragic: A night bus drives through Nottingham. The victim tried to get on board a similar one but was refused because she was 20p short

The
mother called her daughter’s mobile phone twice and on each occasion 
she could hear a male voice making 'grunting' sounds before the line 
went dead.

Police in a passing patrol car stopped to ask the mother if was all okay and she explained that she was looking for her daughter, who, unbeknown to her and the officers, lay injured nearby.

Moments later the defendant ran to the police car and banged on the roof.

The court heard he told the officers he had been walking through the park and had come across the victim who had already been attacked.

Accused: Joseph Moran, 19, denied rape and wounding at Nottingham Crown Court, and claimed he was the one who spotted the attacked girl

He
told the officers 'you had better come quick. I think a girl has been 
raped or something.'

He claimed to the officers that mud and the woman’s
blood were transferred to his body and clothes when he tried to help 
her to her feet.

The girl was found nearby sat with her knees pulled tight to her chin and she was naked from the waist down.

When
told he was being arrested on suspicion of attacking the woman,the 
defendant replied: 'This is what you get for trying to help someone.'

Tests
showed the defendant was around two-and-a-half times over the legal 
drink-drive limit. There were also traces of cannabis and cocaine inside
his body.

Mr Auty alleged Moran panicked when he spotted the nearby police car and quickly fabricated his story.

'He made out he was her saviour, her knight in shining armour,' said Mr Auty.

The
victim told how she and fellow students celebrated the end of exams 
with a lunch-time glass of mulled wine at a Christmas fair in 
Nottingham’s Old Market Square.

She then returned home and helped her 
mother with the weekly supermarket shop before returning to Nottingham 
to continue her end-of-examination celebrations.

The
student watched friends in a band play at a bar before moving on to a 
house party and ending the night at a city centre club.

Moron, of Sneinton, Nottingham, denies rape and wounding.

The trial continues.
