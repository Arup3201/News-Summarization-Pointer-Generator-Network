Vanished: Joshua Oker, 16, disappeared after taking his kayak out on Spain's River Guadiaro

Police searching for a British schoolboy who went missing while kayaking in Spain have found a body.

Joshua Oker, 16, disappeared on Wednesday after taking his kayak out on the River Guadiaro in a remote part of the province of Malaga.

His family raised the alarm yesterday after finding his clothes, kayak and oars on the river bank..

A massive search operation was launched including police, mountain rescue, volunteers and locals - with a police spokesman saying a body was found  in the river at 9.40am this morning.

The body was located near a power station near to the hilltop village of Gaucin.

Specialist divers were among the rescue teams who searched the area around the River Guadiaro, in Malaga province in Andalusia, in the south of the country.

Joshua's kayak, oars and clothes were found by his family at around 5pm yesterday.

The teenager had been kayaking on the River Guadiaro, near Cortes de la Frontera, 100 miles east of the city of Malaga.

His family are understood to live in the nearby village of El Colmenar.

A spokesman for the Civil Guard police force, leading the search, said today: 'Officers looking for Joshua found a body this morning at 9.40am in the water.'

Heavy rain in recent days had swelled the river making conditions for kayaking more dangerous.

Local newspaper La Opinion de Malaga reported that Joshua's expat parents did not report him missing until yesterday as they believed he was with friends.

A friend of Joshua's mother told the newspaper his mobile was turned off or out of range.

The friend, named as Margarita, said his mother had not realised he was missing 'since Joshua sometimes goes out with friends and camps for a few days away from home.'

Joshua often went kayaking with friends, although on this occasion it appears he went out alone.

The search took place in the area around Cortes de la Frontera, a historic whitewashed town of 4,000 people surrounded by spectacular countryside in an area popular with walkers and birdwatchers.
