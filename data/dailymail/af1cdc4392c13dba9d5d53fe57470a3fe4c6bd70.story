International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde arrives for a meeting of the G7 Finance ministers in Marseill

George Osborne yesterday dismissed calls for him to change course on the economy – as he insisted that his deficit reduction plan is the ‘rock of stability’ for Britain’s recovery.

The Chancellor held fast to his view that the Government’s plans were flexible enough to deal with a deteriorating economic situation.

Mr Osborne received the backing of IMF head Christine Lagarde, who said Britain’s plans remained ‘appropriate’.

But she added that spending cuts could tip Britain back into recession 
if they were carried out too fast – a warning Labour immediately seized 
on.

The Chancellor joined Treasury ministers from the G7 countries at a 
summit in Marseilles, France, where they were struggling to agree on how
to tackle the eurozone debt crisis and faltering global economy.

Hours after President Barack Obama announced a £280billion spending 
package to boost jobs in the U.S.

Mr Osborne dismissed suggestions that
Britain should follow a similar course to kick-start growth.

The 
Chancellor – who himself admitted this week growth forecasts are likely 
to be downgraded – said that ditching the Coalition’s package of cuts 
and tax rises would undermine international confidence in Britain and 
could push up interest rates.

He said: ‘We will stick to the deficit reduction plan we have set out.

It is the rock of stability on which our economy is built.

‘It has delivered record low interest rates. Abandoning it would put 
that at risk.

Nothing would be more damaging for Britain at this fragile
moment for the world’s economy than an increase in mortgage rates and 
an increase in the cost of borrowing.’

Speaking in London, Mrs Lagarde said the risks from stagnating growth 
were growing, and had to be weighed against the huge deficits carried by
many Western economies.

She said although tackling deficits was crucial, ‘consolidation, if it 
happens too quickly, will hurt the economy and worsen job prospects’.

She warned that ministers needed to be ‘nimble’ in responding to a fresh
downturn.

George Osborne today met IMF head Christine Lagarde where the pair agreed the UK's approach to deficit reduction was appropriate

She added: ‘The policy stance [in the UK] was premised on a greater role
for private sector demand, especially a robust recovery in exports, to 
take over as the public sector retrenched. But since the summer the 
outlook has been more subdued, including in particular Europe... and the
U.S., which are the two main trading partners of the UK.

‘The policy stance remains appropriate. But the heightened risk means a heightened readiness to respond, particularly if it looks like the economy is headed for weak growth.’

She also suggested there was ‘room’ for the Bank of England to carry out another round of printing money, adding that the ‘risk of recession’ currently outweighed the ‘risk of inflation’. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘Christine Lagarde is right to repeat her warning that cutting too quickly will hurt the recovery and jobs. This is clearly a message aimed at America, the eurozone and Britain too.’

■ Barack Obama began a tour of the 
U.S. yesterday to drum up support for his £280billion package to boost 
the country’s jobs market.

The plans seek to create jobs through 
spending heavily on upgrading roads, bridges and school buildings. The 
President urged Congress to pass the bill ‘quickly’. But Right-wingers 
say the plans simply add to America’s mountain of debt.

Savers have been warned that the rock-bottom rates that have frozen their nest eggs will not rise ‘until 2013’.

The Bank of England cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent in March 2009, the lowest level in history.

And for the 30th consecutive month, it voted yesterday to keep this base rate, the longest period of unchanged rates since the Second World War.

Economists have warned savers, who are being hit by account interest rates as low as 0.1 per cent, that it is likely to last for at least another year.

But Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: ‘We suspect that interest rates are unlikely to rise before 2013.’

Homeowners with a variable mortage can look forward to a further extended period of low rates.

But for savers, the income from their savings, which many pensioners rely on, has all but disappeared.

Simon Rose, from the campaign group Save Our Savers, added: ‘Current policies are squeezing savers to the brink of extinction.’

A recent poll by the price comparison site MoneySupermarket of more than 7,200 adults said more than half would like to see a rate rise ‘in the near future’.
