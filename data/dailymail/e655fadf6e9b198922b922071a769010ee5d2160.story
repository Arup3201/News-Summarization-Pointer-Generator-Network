Derby County appear to be on course for their second signing of the January window with reports in Spain announcing a deal has been struck for Eibar defender Raul Albentosa.

Head coach Steve McClaren has stated more new arrivals would follow Darren Bent through the door and a fee of £470,000 is said to have been reached for the 26-year-old.

McClaren admitted on Thursday that Derby were looking at positions to strengthen to allow regular first-team players the opportunity of rest as the season reaches its second half.

Centre-back is an obvious area that could be improved by another option, with an additional left-back also likely to be on the list.

At 6ft 4in Albentosa is an imposing centre-back and has helped Eibar to eighth in La Liga this season.

‘We are looking at one or two possibilities,’ McClaren said. 'We have got one or two positions in which we are over-playing players at the present moment, and we are looking in those areas.’
