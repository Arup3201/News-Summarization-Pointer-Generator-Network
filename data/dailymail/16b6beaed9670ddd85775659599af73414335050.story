Charged: Police said Gregory Cornelius carried out the horrific attack on his 73-year-old mother because she hadn't done his laundry

A 46-year-old man, who allegedly duct taped his elderly mother to a chair, beat her and cut the tube to her oxygen tank, has been charged with attempted murder.

Police said Gregory 
Cornelius carried out the horrific attack on his 73-year-old mother, named in property records as Joann Cornelius, because she hadn't done his laundry.

Murrieta police Sgt Phil Gomez said when officers went to Mrs Cornelius' home in Murrieta, California, on Easter Sunday afternoon, they found her with broken bones, bruises and gashes on her arms from where she was 
bound.

He added that Cornelius had called a friend on Sunday and told her he was going to kill his 
mother.

Sgt Gomez called Gomez a 'loser' and said he had been living with his mother in The Colony, a gated retirement community.

Cornelius has a string of previous convictions, including one from 2005 when he was charged with elder abuse 
against his mother.
