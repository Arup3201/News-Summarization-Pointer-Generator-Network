A sports reporter managed to namedrop 22 of Robin Williams’ films in two minutes as part of a TV tribute to star.

Sports news anchor Zach Klein, of WSB television in Atlanta, Georgia, namechecked the films during his sports round-up just a few hours after the 63-year-old actor died.

'For those of you who suffer from Insomia, Saturday's Braves game was perfect for you.'

He went on to describe a baseball player with Happy Feet and how another flexed his muscles like Popeye. 

Other films mentioned during the segment included Mrs Doubtfire, One Hour Photo, Hook, World's Greatest Day and Moscow on the Hudson.

'Honestly, I just wanted to do something to show my appreciating for the greatness that was Robin Williams,' Klein told AFP via email on Tuesday.

Insomnia; The Timekeeper; Nine Months; Man of the Year; Happy Feet; Jumanji; Popeye; Hook; Everyone's Hero; Mrs Doubtfire; World's Greatest Dad; Father's Day; Toys; Seize The Day; Patch Adams; Hamlet; Jack; Mork and Mindy; One Hour Photo; The Best of Times; Moscow on the Hudson; The Final Cut

'It was a hard day for so many and I thought a subtle tribute to a man many loved and admired was the least I could do.'

Robin Williams hanged himself on Sunday night while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom.

He had several superficial cuts on the inside of his left wrist.

A pocket knife with what appeared to be dried blood was discovered nearby.

The
 Mrs Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting star's suicide comes after decades 
of battling depression and alcohol and drug addiction.

He was also facing significant financial pressures and admitted he was selling a $35million estate in Napa because he could no longer afford it.

Williams struggled with depression and an addiction to cocaine and alcohol for decades.

Last month the married father-of-three was back in rehab 'fine-tuning' his sobriety in a year where he had been working on six movies and a TV series.
