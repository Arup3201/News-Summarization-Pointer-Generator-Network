For anyone who has screamed at a bad refereeing decision, technology is set to reveal exactly what the referee does or doesn't see during key decisions.

Sky and the RFU are set to trial the first ever use of 'RefCam' in a live rugby union broadcast when Newcastle Falcons take on London Scottish this Sunday.

The technology uses a three inch high definition camera strapped to the referee to let viewers see exactly what they do.

It has already been trialled in boxing and wrestling matches.

Sunday's game will show live footage from a camera placed on the shirt of match referee Matt Carley, including close-ups of the scrum in particular.

Sky believes the footage will help viewers better understand why referees make the decisions they do - and possible settle arguments over exactly what they saw.

Gus Williamson, Executive Producer, Sky Sports Rugby Union, said: 'At
Sky Sports we are always looking to introduce broadcast innovations 
that add depth to our coverage and this will certainly help viewers 
understand the decisions that referees make.

'We are excited about 
working with the RFU and we are confident that rugby viewers will be 
fascinated by this new way of watching the game.'

As well as increasing the viewing 
experience for supporters and helping them understand the role of the 
referee, RefCam will crucially provide a vehicle for referees further 
down the leagues to gain valuable insight into professional refereeing.

It will allow viewers to see exactly what a referee does during key decisions

The RFU's Head of Professional Referee Development Ed Morrison said: 'This is an exciting development and one that we’re excited to trial. Not only will it offer a new perspective for viewers but it will also provide us with an additional tool which can be utilised within the on-going development of our referees.'

Dylan Hartley, the England captain is shown the yellow card by referee Steve Walsh. Referees could soon routinely wear 'refcams' allowing viewers to see exactly why they make decisions

The system has previously used in boxing and wrestling matches, with an American TV networking trialling it during a recent Amir Khan bout.

It is hoped the technology could be expanded to other sports if current trials are a success.
