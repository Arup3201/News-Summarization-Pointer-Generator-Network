She is never one to duck out of a physical challenge. And while Pippa Middleton could probably well afford to while away the colder months on a beach in Mustique, the 30-year-old sister to the Duchess of Cambridge chose to hit the slopes with her stockbroker boyfriend Nico.

The two are holidaying in the chichi Austrian ski resort of Lech, a luxury resort in the Austrian Alps where Russian billionaires rub shoulders with oligarchs, apres-ski shopping consists of Cartier and Rolex and the lifts are sponsored by Chanel.  

Pippa and 36-year-old Nico, her boyfriend for more than a year now, were joined at the resort by Nico's grandparents.

Love birds Pippa Middleton and Nico Jackson are on ski vacation in Lech

Nico Jackson glances down to reach into his pocket, for a ski pass perhaps?

Keeping
 up with the sporty socialite no doubt keeps Nico, who was 
spotted running around Battersea Park in South London with her recently, in tip top condition.

Last year, the pair took part in a ski race in St Moritz, Switzerland, with Nico pipping Pippa, 30, to the post.

Prince George's aunt completed the 26-mile Engadin Ski Marathon in 2hrs 48mins, eight minutes behind Nico.

'I'm not tired at all,' declared Pippa, who has also taken part in the 50-mile Highland Cross endurance race in Scotland.

She
 met Nico, who grew up in a red-brick terraced house in Folkestone 
before making his millions at Deutsche Bank, on a previous skiing trip.
