He's braved freezing Siberian rivers and petted a tranquilsed polar bear in the Arctic.

But it seems tough guy Vladimir Putin may finally have met his match - with a flock of migrating cranes.

In recent weeks, Mr Putin has rarely left his official residence, sparking speculation that illness or injury had laid him low.

Is it a bird? No, it's a crane! Vladimir Putin has not been seen in public much since he was flanked by migrating cranes during a well publicised flight in a motorised hang glider back in September

But it emerged today that the president's September flight in a motorised hang-glider, in which he got snarled up with several cranes, may have aggravated an old injury, according to newspaper Vedomosti.

Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the claims. He told the
state news agency RIA Novosti that the president had an old injury, but that it was 
not connected to the highly publicised flight.

Instead Mr Peskov said Mr Putin's absence from the Kremlin was down to courtesy for the Russian people: he didn't want his 
motorcade to disrupt Moscow's notoriously bad traffic.Â 

You bird brain: Mr Putin eyeballs one of the Siberian cranes from the safety of his glider. It has emerged that he may have aggravated an old injury

Ouch: A few days after the September 5 flight, Mr Putin looked in pain during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit Leaders Retreat II in Vladivostok, Russia

The presidential motorcade forces the 
shutdown of large stretches of highway, an inconvenience that many 
irritated drivers mark by blaring their horns angrily as the president's
car races past.

Mr Putin has also put off several expected 
trips abroad, including to India, Turkey and Bulgaria.

The hang-glider flight with the cranes, 
which took place in September in Vladivostok, was one of Putin's 
trademark adventurous media events.

Chocks away! Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the president had an old injury, but it was not connected to the flight

Strain: Mr Peskov added that the president had 'pulled a muscle' but had not tried to conceal it. It was usual for 'athletes' to sustain such injuries, he added

The 60-year-old Russian leader has 
assiduously cultivated an image of vigor and daring. He is also an accomplished skier and a judo aficionado.

'Indeed he pulled a muscle,' Mr Peskov
said. 'It happened 
before Vladivostok. He was suffering from some muscle pain then.'

He added: 'Actually, we have never tried to 
conceal it because any athlete has lots of injuries, which, however, do 
not mean any restrictions of his activities.'

Spokesman says Putin is suffering from old injury, which is nothing to do with September flight
