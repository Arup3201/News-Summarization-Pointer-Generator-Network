A plan to merge giant British defence firm BAE with a European rival ran into major trouble yesterday.

MPs, shareholders and military experts said the £30billion deal with EADS might jeopardise jobs as well as national security.

Politicians from both sides of the house called for hearings into the merger, which would create the largest arms firm in the world.

Concerns: David Cummings, left, said the merger undervalued the defence firm and Admiral Lord West, right, warned that the ‘special relationship’ with the U.S. on military matters could come under threat

The Government has a ‘golden share’ in BAE, which it can use to block the merger on a temporary basis.

Tory MP Ben Wallace said ministers should use this option if the French and German governments do not give up their large ownership stakes in EADS.

‘It can’t be that a British company, that stands alone, is bought by a French and German government company,’ he said.

‘It’s naïve to think that the socialist French government won’t interfere with the company. When that happens, poor old British workers will get hammered.’

Fellow Tory Brian Binley said: ‘I can see in ten years’ time, when the crunch comes again as they always do, that it will be very easy for the Franco-German majority to say they’re going to gradually pull away and support their own industries.’

He also raised concerns about whether BAE’s reputation for cutting-edge technology could be under threat.

‘There’s a concern about the quality of their management,’ he said. ‘For all the efficiency that the Germans are supposed to bring, I’m not sure that has been reflected.’

The merger has raised fears that the new company, which will be 60 per cent owned by existing EADS shareholders, would shift skilled jobs overseas.

David Cummings, of Standard Life, which has a large stake in BAE, said it was ‘not really clear to me as a shareholder why they’ve chosen to do the deal’.

He said the merger undervalued the defence firm that was formed in 1999 by the combination of British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems.

One well-placed source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three of BAE’s top five shareholders, including its largest investor Invesco with 13 per cent of the company, were not in favour of the merger. That would be sufficient to block the deal, regardless of political intervention.

Admiral Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, warned that the ‘special relationship’ with the US on military matters could come under threat.

‘I have concerns about American exchange of information with us,’ he said. ‘We are joined at the hips with the Americans on nuclear submarines. I just cannot see the Americans being happy about it.’ MPs on the defence select committee are expected to agree today that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond should be called to give evidence in a hearing, alongside BAE and EADS executives

Labour MP Thomas Docherty said: ‘It’s not a matter purely for the two companies, I hope the minister of defence will give evidence. The Government has got to have a view.

‘My understanding is that the Americans are not enthusiastic. It’s clear that there are a number of programmes where we share intellectual property, not least the nuclear deterrent.’

Gerald Howarth, a Tory defence minister until the reshuffle earlier this month, said the deal might have to be delayed given MPs’ doubts.

‘The future of BAE is critical to our economic and security interests,’ he said, adding that an October 10 deadline for the two firms to flesh out their proposal was unlikely to be met. ‘Parliament will want to be satisfied on some of these issues,’ he added.

‘Given that it goes to the heart of our national security, given that there are national sovereignty concerns at stake, we need to know some of the detail.’

BAE is building the new generation of Trident nuclear missiles and the Astute class nuclear-powered submarine, and has argued that key projects would be ‘ringfenced’ from the rest of the company.

MPs for constituencies where some of BAE’s 35,000 UK employees work met yesterday to discuss how to prevent jobs being lost.

EADS, which employs 17,000 in Britain, is understood to have argued that these jobs will be safer if it merges with BAE, because it would reverse plans to move factories that make wings for Airbus planes to Spain.
