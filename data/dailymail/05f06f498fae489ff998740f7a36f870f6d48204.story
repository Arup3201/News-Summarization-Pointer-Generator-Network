Actor Jon Voight has released a video voicing his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his disdain for President Barack Obama.

The Oscar winner and father of actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie does not waste time going after Obama either, saying almost right off the bat; 'President Obama does not love Israel.'

He follows this up by saying; 'His whole agenda is to control Israel. In this way, he can be friends with all of Israel’s enemies.'

He then goes a step further in the video, which is an exclusive to Just Jared, and says of Obama; 'He doesn’t want Bibi Netanyahi to win this upcoming election. America has not been the same since his presidency. I beg all of you to understand the truth.'

As for his reason behind the video, he says; 'I love Israel. I want to see Israel survive and not be overtaken by the mad men of this world.' 

Voight, who attended The Catholic University of America, has long been a fervent and vocal supporter of Israel and its people.

He previously attacked Obama for his dealings with the country back in July 2008 in a Washington Times editorial, before he was even elected to office.

Voight, a Republican, wrote in the piece; 'If, God forbid, we live to see Mr. Obama president, we will live through a socialist era that America has not seen before, and our country will be weakened in every way.'

It's not just Obama either, as he also lashed out at his former costar Jane Fonda in a FOX News interview, saying the actress had been 'aiding and abetting those who seek the destruction of Israel.'

He has also previously labeled Obama a liar and an anti-semite in interviews.
