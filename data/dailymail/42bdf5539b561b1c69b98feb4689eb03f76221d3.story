A brain-damaged former motorbike stuntman last night revealed he blamed himself for suffering humiliating beatings from his now-jailed wife.

Father-of-three Eddie Kidd, 54, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, was kicked and strangled in front of carers by former stripper Samantha, 44, who told the daredevil he was ‘a f****** spastic’.

Mr Kidd was one of the world's most famous stunt riders until he suffered serious head and pelvic injuries following a failed stunt jump in 1996 in Warwickshire which left him unable to walk.

He told The Sun on Sunday: ‘She had started drinking heavily and would just change. She would slap me in the face and punch me in the chest and arms, strangle me and say horrible things.

‘As a man, any man, to be beaten by your wife is desperately humiliating and, in a way, shameful.  I ended up blaming myself - thinking she had taken too much - or, that it was my fault.

‘I took on so much when I was riding. Then after all the stunts, all the fanfare, I am sat in a chair being beaten by my wife and there is nothing I can do.’

Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic violence last December after her husband’s family reported her to police days after the couple split up. She was jailed for five months for four assaults last month.

Speaking in his first interview since her sentencing, some of Mr Kidd’s words were translated by one of his three carers. The crash left him unable to talk or walk unaided and he requires full-time care.

Former James Bond stuntman Mr Kidd - who has three children from previous marriages - was left shaking and 'absolutely hysterical' by her actions, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told last month.

Mr Kidd, who was previously married to dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met his wife in 1988. They met again at a party in Mayfair in 2004 and later wed.

The court heard that Mrs Kidd, who once appeared in children’s TV show Byker Grove, assaulted her husband three times at their home and once in Southampton between July and October last year.

In one incident, Mr Kidd rained a series of blows on him after she was woken up, a witness told the court. She was said to have told him: 'For f***'s sake, Eddie. How do you expect me to sleep?'

'After all the stunts, all the fanfare, I am sat in a chair being beaten by my wife and there is nothing I can do'

She continued with 'a barrage of abuse and swearing' before launching a quick succession of half a dozen blows to his face and head, the court was told.

On another occasion, she was said to have kicked Mr Kidd in retaliation after a carer had difficulty helping him out of a car and into a wheelchair.

In a separate incident, the court heard she slapped Mr Kidd's face in 'retaliation and frustration' at his hand coming off a rail and coming into contact with her.

District Judge William Ashworth said Mrs Kidd had committed an 'abuse of trust and power'.

He added: 'These four assaults on Eddie Kidd represent a pattern of violent behaviour towards your husband which, taken together, are in the highest bracket for sentencing guidelines.’

He added: 'Whatever you felt about his disability, you didn't shy away from raining six punches on him or slapping, kicking and throttling him so much that you had to be pulled off him.'

In his prime Mr Kidd was a hugely famous stunt rider. He first stunned spectators in December 1979, when he jumped 80ft across the gap in a derelict railway bridge in Essex on a 400cc Yamaha.

Mr Kidd's achievements culminated in 1993 when he jumped the Great Wall of China and beat Robbie Knievel, son of Evel Knievel, to the stunt bike world championship.
