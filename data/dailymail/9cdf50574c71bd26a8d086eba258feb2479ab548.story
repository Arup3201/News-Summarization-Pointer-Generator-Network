Wildlife researches have charted a grizzly bear's astonishing three-year, 2,800-mile trek through backyards, down main streets and up mountains - in what they have deemed a 'bizarre' journey.

Ethyl the grizzly bear was captured raiding an apple orchard in Lake Blaine, Montana in 2012 and was fitted with a radio collar that sent GPS data to a satellite once a week.

After she got her new collar, she was relocated 50 miles away to Middle Fork of the Flathead River because her previous home was not deemed safe, researchers told Fox News.

What they gathered from the GPS data over the next three years astonished them.

Trek: A map shows a grizzly bear's incredible 2,800 journey from the mountains of Montana and into Idaho after she was captured in 2012 and fitted with a radio collar that sent GPS data to researchers

Route: She trekked around Montana before going into Idaho and then heading west before back to Montana

'The one thing we can say is this was not representative of normal bear movement, and certainly not female grizzly bear movement,' Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery program coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told The Missoulian. 'She had some really bizarre travels.'

Fox reported that these 'bizarre' movements were prompted by her move to an unknown place.

But if she indeed was trying to get back home, she took the scenic route.

The incredible data shows that she headed south to the Mission Mountains Wilderness and Jocko Lakes - which is about 120 miles from her starting point - before heading another 120 miles south to the Bitterroot Mountains and eventually into Idaho.

She then headed 200 miles north to pass the towns of Wallace and Kellogg, where she hibernated - but not before the Kellogg newspaper reported a sighting of her near the town's high school. 

Spotted: The daring bear walked through backyards, around downtown areas and across highways

Journey: Her journey - which has left researchers baffled - is extremely unusual for a female grizzly bear

After waking up again, she headed to Missoula, Montana and towards the small town of Lolo.

When she arrived, she wandered downtown - right through the streets and backyards - into landfills and across I-90 but astonishingly there were no reported sightings of her, Fox News reported. 

'She was minding her own business, walking around trying to figure out where she is,' Servheen said.

On one occasion, she nearly made it back home but instead missed it and headed to Glacier National Park and then headed west again.

She eventually lost her collar on October 17. 

'The area and terrain she covered was pretty significant,' Lori Roberts, a researcher with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, told Fox. 'She just wasn't travelling on flat ground. She made huge crossings across mountains, rivers, and even towns.' 

Ethyl (like the grizzly bear pictured) eventually lost her collar in October but officials hope to find her again

She added that researchers hope to find Ethyl - who was named after the owner of the apple orchard where she was first found in 2006 and then 2012 - and check in on her.

Speaking to the Missoulian, conversationalists said that while they cannot be 100 per cent sure  why Ethyl went on her ramble, the tracking has taught them that the beasts can co-exist with people.

Officials believe Ethyl, who was found with a two-year-old cub when she was captured and tagged in 2012, is in her 20s. Grizzly bears live until up to about 30 years.

Ethyl was fitted with a radio collar after she was found raiding an apple orchard in 2012 and the trek she took afterwards stunned researchers

Over the next three years, she walked for nearly 3,000 miles across state parks in Montana before heading into Idaho and wandering through towns

She eventually headed back to Montana but lost her collar in October

Some experts have suggested that she might have walked so far in a bid to get home after being relocated - but the trek has researchers stumped
