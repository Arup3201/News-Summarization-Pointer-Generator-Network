Daniel Hunt, 33, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, disappeared on Saturday

A 'wild sports junkie' has gone missing in the Swiss Alps while 'speed flying'.

Daniel Hunt, 33, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, disappeared on Saturday while attempting to speed fly down the Lauterbrunnen mountain in the Swiss Alps.

Speed flying combines skiing with paragliding, using a fabric wing to get down a steep mountain slope at speeds of up to 75mph.

When Mr Hunt, who owns The Natural Food Store in Turnham Green, west London, failed to arrive at the agreed landing site at just after 10am rescue teams were alerted.

The daredevil who  takes part in a range of extreme sports including slacklining - walking across chasms on a high wire - has completed a number of speed flights before but on this occasion while his friends landed safety, he vanished.

Friends have launched an appeal for funds to pay for an ongoing search and rescue operation after his insurance company said they would not pay out any more.

So far just over £3,000 has been donated and Kara De Los Reyes, who heads up the search team in the UK, said the support had been absolutely amazing. She added: 'We've had a really good response from a lot of people.

'It's hard to tell if we need more volunteers. We have six climbers and ten on the ground and some paragliders.'

It is feared Mr Hunt could have fallen into a crevice or glacier in the Lauterbrunnen mountain area - a favourite of speed flyers - requiring helicopters and dog teams in the hunt.

Miss De Los Reyes said she first 
heard Mr Hunt had gone missing on Sunday morning when her boyfriend 
phoned to say he had not arrived at the landing point.

She added: 'He rang me up about 9am and told me that after their flight, Dan didn't land behind him.

'They
took off one by one and in speed flying you can see the person behind. 
Tim searched the landing and take off area and there was no sign of 
him.'

Mr Hunt's friends have set up a Facebook and Twitter account to appeal for funds to help the search.

According to the Evening Standard one of his best friends, Pedro Pimentel, 33, who has taken part in extreme sports with Mr Hunt, said: 'It's quite surprising that he has gone missing, he is experienced, I think he could still be alive.'

Friend Laura Saunders, 26, a photographer, said: 'Daniel is such a lovely guy, everyone respects him and he is well known in the extreme sports community.

'You could not meet anyone kinder and everyone he meets likes him. He is very experienced in extreme sports so it’s very worrying and surprising that he is missing.

'We know that finding him quickly is vital because the longer a search takes the less chance there is of a good outcome.'

Mr Hunt takes part in a number of extreme sports and was said to be looking forward to the challenge which lay ahead in Switzerland.

Lauterbrunnen is in the Bern Canton of Switzerland.
