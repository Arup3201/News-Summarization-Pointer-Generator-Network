There's dumb, there's dumber ... and then there's Mama June.

Besieged by a sex scandal that could see her lose custody of her children, the 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch is now one of the star cameo's in Dumb and Dumber 2, it has been revealed.

In the long-awaited sequel, out this weekend, Mama June plays the trailer park wife of the character Harry - played by Jeff Daniels - in a short dream sequence.

The former TLC personality revealed the guest role on the Facebook page of her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, saying she was honored to work with comedy duo Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.

According to PEOPLE, her scene shows the character Lloyd - played by Jim Carrey - going to pick up Harry's young daughter for a date, only to grope the breast of Mama June instead.

Bad timing: Mama June Shannon filmed a racy cameo role in Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels which hits cinemas this weekend, while her tell-all with Dr Phil about the sex scandal that has engulfed her family will be aired Monday

Entertainment Weekly reported the scene was 'troubling' because 'Carrey’s character is essentially lusting for a girl half his age'.

Mama June's appearance in the comedy - which has been panned by critics - was kept a secret until the movie hit cinemas.

The film was shot earlier this year.

In October it emerged that Mama June was dating a man convicted of child molestation, who was alleged to have assaulted her own daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, when she was a child.

Mama June was dating the man, Mark McDaniel, at the time, and the molestation conviction sent him to prison for 10 years.

Universal Pictures, the distributors of Dumb and Dumber To, have not commented on Mama June's appearance.

Despite bad reviews, Variety believes the film is set for a box office opening between $36 million to $40 million this weekend.

The cameo is one of many controversies to plague Mama June this week.

She also revealed that TLC is still paying for her daughters' tuition and 'some other things' despite canceling their show following reports she was dating a child molester.

TLC dropped the show after images emerged apparently showing Mama June with McDaniel.

Even though she denies they are in a relationship, Mama June  told Dr Phil that she has no ill-feelings towards the network for cancelling the show.

Speaking out: In an exclusive interview set to air on Dr Phil next week, June 'Mama June' Shannon has again denied she is in a relationship with her daughter's molester, claiming he is now seeing someone else

Fears: TLC canceled the show after reports that Mama June had allowed her nine-year-old daughter Honey Boo Boo, pictured chatting with Dr Phil, to have contact with the molester, Mark McDaniel

'I have nothing bad to say about TLC,' she said in the interview. 'They have been good to me. They still are very good to me.'

She explained that, despite rumors she was not going to get paid, she has received money from the network - as have her estranged husband Sugar Bear and other stars of the show.  

'They're still taking care of the girls today with tutoring, which I'm very, very grateful for,' she said. 'They're taking care of some other things for the girls, I'm very, very grateful for. And I'm grateful for the experience.'

Despite holding no grudges against the network, she claims that their reason for cancelling the show - her allowing her children to be near McDaniel - is simply not true.

She claims that at least one of the photos showing them together since his release earlier this year has been photo shopped.

Not-so-happy families: Despite their smiles, Mama June claimed in the interview that she is no longer with Sugar Bear and does not love him. She said he cheated on her earlier this year, leading to their break up

'I would never take my child around someone like that,' she told Dr Phil. 

Still, she would not shed any light on the investigation by child protective services.

'I can't talk about that issue,' she said. 'I was told by them not to talk about that issue... The only part I can say is that they're not saying that they're in a unsafe environment.'

She previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel since his release - one coincidentally and once to give her daughter, Pumpkin, some closure because she believed he was her father. 

'He's moved on,' she told Dr Phil of McDaniel. 'He's got a girlfriend and it's not me.'

She added that she is also no longer in a relationship with Sugar Bear - her husband and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson's father.

'He cheated,' she insisted. 'He hurt me a lot. I am not in love with him.' 

Victim: Her daughter Anna Cardwell, now 20, said she was molested by McDaniel when she was eight

'Fakes': Mama June said at least one image of her with McDaniel was photo shopped. Here she is apparently pictured with her daughter Honey Boo Boo and Mark McDaniel, who is touching the girl

Sugar Bear and one of her daughters, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, will also appear in interviews with Dr, Phil.

Following the abuse in 2002, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell told police that McDaniel had abused her repeatedly, sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed next to her.

Since the scandal emerged, Anna has said that Pumpkin has turned against her and stood up for her mother because she believes that McDaniel is her father.

Mama June has denied this is the case.

Pumpkin told Dr Phil that she is still trying to come to terms with exactly what happened. 

'Now that I'm 14, I understand a little bit more which, I mean, I have a lot of questions,' she said. 'I asked Mama what happened. You know, I guess that I wanted closure on actually who he was. I wanted to actually know for sure if he did what he did, or if he didn't, you know? I mean, I guess that's the questions I've had.'

In a previous interview, Mama June said that 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel.

At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna was when she says she was abused by McDaniel.  

The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer.  

'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' 

Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell.
