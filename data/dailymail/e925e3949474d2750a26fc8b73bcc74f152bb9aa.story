You can't sell just anything on Ebay.

The Canadian town of Cape St George got into trouble with the online marketplace yesterday when it posted a listing for a dead whale that washed onto its shores last week.

Mayor Peter Fenwick says the town was informed that it was their responsibility to get rid of the rotting 40-foot sperm whale, so like many people trying to get rid of something they didn't want they turned to Ebay.

They weren't necessarily interested in making a profit off of the whale, Fenwick said, but rather just finding anyone willing to take it off their hands.

Any takers? The town of Cape St George in Newfoundland, Canada is trying to get rid of a 40-foot sperm whale that washed ashore last week

But as of Monday afternoon, the advertisement had been pulled down by the site which outlaws the selling of animals, dead or alive, on their site.

Fenwick was also informed by Environment Canada that selling the endangered sperm whale carcass violates the federal act protecting species at risk.

By the time the advertisement had been pulled down, the highest bid surpassed $2,000.

Fenwick says they looked into moving the whale with a 50-foot boat, but that the vessel wasn't strong enough. The says they can't afford any other method of disposing the whale.

Now he hopes the bidders are still interested in the whale.

The city is willing to give the whale away for free as long as someone will take responsibility for towing it away. 

No luck: The town initially tried selling the carcass on Ebay, but that listing was taken down by the site for violating their policy against selling animals - alive or dead. Bids reached over $2,000 before it was taken down

'We’ll be glad to talk to them about giving them the whale,' Fenwick told CTV News. 'We’re hoping that’s not illegal.'

Fenwick says the whale hasn't started decomposing yet, but believes that's because it's still partially covered in ocean water in near freezing temperatures.

The mayor would like to see the whale gone before that though, telling the Toronto Sun that 'the smell of rotting fat is horrible'.

This is the fourth whale that has washed up this Spring in Newfoundland.

When two blue whales washed up last week, the Royal Ontario Museum offered to presrve the marine animals
