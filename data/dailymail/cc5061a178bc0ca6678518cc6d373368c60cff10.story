Katy Perry has launched an official 'left shark' costume inspired by one of the backing dancers from her Super Bowl halftime show, who became an overnight internet sensation when he appeared to forget his dance moves live on air. 

The 30-year-old singer, who was joined by backing dancers dressed as surfboards, palm trees and beach balls, as well as the now-infamous shark duo, for her rendition of California Girls and Teenage Dream at the NFL final in February, tweeted the news to her delighted followers on Monday evening, advising them to head to her online store and pick up one of the $129.99 onesies.

Alongside a picture of the new product, she said: 'YOU CAN NOW BE A PROPER #LEFTSHARK WITH THIS OFFICIAL, GLORIOUS #LEFTSHARK ONESIE'

A few minutes earlier, the Unconditional singer had tweeted an image of a makeshift shark costume, which was accompanied by the message: 'ATTENTION INTERNET: NO LONGER DO YOU HAVE TO DIY LEFT SHARK COSTUME LIKE THIS GUY'

As part of her new line of left shark clothing, the pop superstar has also released a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of the left shark, with the words 'Current Mood' emblazoned across the front and 'Katy Perry' and '#leftshark' on the back.

And while many of her fans were thrilled to see that the left shark's five minutes of fame have been extended, others were horrified by the high price tag attached to the novelty loungewear design. 

'I can't even afford to go out with my friend let alone $129 onesies!!!! Stop taunting me!!!!!!' one person wrote in response to Katy's tweet. 

Another added: 'It's too expensive, I will buy fake ones.'

DIY alternative: Katy advised her fans that they no longer need to attempt to make their own left shark onesies at home, using this image as an example

Attention! The Unconditional singer peaked her fans' interest when she posted this tweet, just minutes before announcing the launch of the left shark onesie

But the news has come as a welcome surprise to many people, who admitted that they would be more than willing to shell out the money needed to lay their hands on one of the onesies. 

'MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE CAUSE I SUCK AT DIY!!!' one person wrote, clearly overjoyed that they would not need to create their own left shark costume at home. 'But I'm good at spending money. Ordering it now!!'

Prior to the launch of Katy's official left shark merchandise line, a number of unofficial products have been made available by eager entrepreneurs hoping to cash in on the left shark's seemingly unwavering popularity. 

Last month, Katy's attorneys served an artist who was selling small figurines of the globally-famous dancing shark, who was played by professional dancer Bryan Gaw, online with a cease and desist letter, insisting that he remove the products from the website on which they were being sold. 

Prior to their warning, Fernando Sosa, 31, had been selling up to 15 of the $24.99 three-inch sharks, which were made using a 3D printer, per day via online marketplace Shapeways.com.

Wardrobe update: As well as the onesie, Katy is also selling this left shark T-shirt for $25

Shake your fin: Many fans watching the halftime performance felt that the sharks had stolen the show

However, less than 36 hours after his statues became available, Shapeways officials  notified Mr Sosa of a cease-and-desist letter from Perry's Los Angeles-based attorneys who demanded the shark's removal from the site.

'They said they were pulling the design because they didn't want to deal with lawyers,' Mr Sosa said, adding that the company promptly cancelled his orders and refunded his customers.

The letter from attorney Steve Plinio said Katy is the 'owner of the intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes' portrayed during the halftime show.

The letter said the failure to comply with the demands outlined 'will be viewed by the courts as willful infringement'.

Sosa said he didn't think a halftime show prop would be copyrighted. He added that his product didn't mention Katy Perry or claim that it was associated with her.
