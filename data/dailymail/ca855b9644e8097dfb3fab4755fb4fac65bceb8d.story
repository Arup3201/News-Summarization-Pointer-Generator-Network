A former Premier League striker has been suspended from Twitter after allegedly launching a campaign to tweet raunchy pictures of women sent in by their ex-boyfriends.

Controversial footballer Leon Knight is being investigated by police after allegedly setting up the site called 'S*** Alert Pictures' on the social networking site.

Suspended: Knight, who was once on the books at Chelsea, has been temporarily banned from Twitter after his latest indiscretion

The 29-year-old, who has already courted trouble on Twitter by abusing WAG Danielle Lloyd, has been suspended from the site.

He had publicised the 'event' under the strapline, 'It's judgment day b*****s', before discussing the raunchy pictures of women, uploaded without permission, under the hashtag #sap.

Knight, currently without a club, tweeted 'taster' pictures of women befor Twitter intervened and suspended his account after complaints.

Although some Twitter users appeared to encourage Knight to post the pictures before his account was suspended, the footballer was largely condemned on the social networking site for his behaviour.

Knight has played for 15 different clubs in his career, in five different countries. He was released from his last team, Northern Irish side Glentoran, after sending alleged homophobic tweets.

His latest indiscretion on Twitter comes just a month after the failed journeyman striker was investigated for abusing Danielle Lloyd, the wife of Wolves midfielder Jamie O'Hara.

Knight had an argument through the social network with Miss Lloyd's husband, with whom the model has two children.

O'Hara, 25, was incensed after Knight, 29, tweeted to him: 'You're married correct !! But ur married to a raging s**t bag [sic]'

Knight followed up the comment with many other accusations relating to Danielle's past, insinuating that she'd played the field with many other footballers in her time.

O'Hara wrote: 'If at @leonknight82 has got a problem he should give me a call instead of giving the bigun on twitter to a women with two kids.

He added: 'To all people asking me about Leon knight this is now in the hands of the police and my lawyers, jealousy is the the route to all evil.'

Clearly upset, Danielle later took to her own page and wrote: 'Sadly I might be coming off Twitter as I can't take much more abuse from scum when all am trying to do is be a good mum & wife I love all[sic].'

However, Danielle later changed her mind about shutting down her Twitter account.

The investigation into Knight's Twitter comments comes as prominent celebrities have spoken out about personal attacks aimed at their accounts and police begin to crack down on online abuse.

Rose to Danielle's defense: Jamie O'Hara was understandably outraged by Leon's comments, and quick to retaliate

Stuart Hyde, chief constable of Cumbria and the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on social media, said earlier this week: ‘Social media is increasingly part of police business and the law covers situations where you have comment that goes way beyond legitimate opinion.

'We don’t just deal with people who are famous. People have the right to freedom of speech but it has to be within the law.’

Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution.

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.
