First Peppa Pig’s timeslot was messed with - now an equally popular kids TV show, In the Night Garden, has been shafted from the prime after-dinner slot which has disgusted parents.

Families are incredulous that the timely 6.30pm slot has been rescheduled to 11.30am with parents using the show as the perfect wind–down time for their children at the end of the day before going to bed.

Hundreds of furious parents have taken to the ABC for Kids for Parents Facebook page to vent their anger with many suggesting a name change for the TV show which is now airing in the morning.

In the Night Garden kids TV show has moved from the prime 6.30pm slot to 11.30am much to the disgust of parents throughout the country

Irate parents are calling on the ABC to change the time of the show back to air when kids are winding down at the end of the day

‘Not happy about In the Night Garden changing! It's our dinner time show before bed. They say goodnight and go to bed in it not good lunchtime!’ Jennifer O'Hara posted.

‘In The Middle Of The Day Garden??? ‘Candice Nix posted. ‘My kids are allowed tv 4:30-5:30 while I make clean/make tea and 6:30-7 while having there bottle/milk and we do dishes. So Play School, Peppa Pig and In The Night Garden. What a filthy act by the ABC!’

The ABC has already cut the Peppa Pig double episodes in the afternoons with now a single episode in the afternoon and one in the morning. Play School times have also been changed and The Wiggles moved to a much earlier slot.

In an attempt to appease the irate parents, the ABC repeatedly replied to the remarks on the page suggesting that parents could access more episodes through ABC iview which added fuel to the fire.

‘Yes for you to spend money on downloading or buy the DVD....so much for free’ Alie Gebing retorted.

ABC TV controller of children’s TV Deidre Brennan said the altered schedule, which was partly due  to providing for children up to six years old after 6pm, had already seen a 25 per cent rise in ratings in the 6.30pm-7pm slot in the first two nights this week.

‘ABC TV cares about kids and we value the trust that Australian families place in us to educate and entertain their children with quality local and international programming,’ she said. ‘ Changes to the program times can have an impact on both parents and kids, but we are excited to offer new channel schedules that better reflect the lives of our audience.’

There was similar outrage among parents when the double episodes of Peppa Pig in the afternoons was cut with now a single episode in the afternoon and one in the morning.

But not all parents are outraged about the reshuffle with some suggesting a good old fashioned bedtime story was the best way to go at the end of the day.

‘Perhaps people could try reading books before bedtime rather than watching tv,’ Nicole Eyles suggested. ‘Probably more settling and a much better habit to get into. I am not saying people shouldn't watch tv, my girls watch plenty, just saying that tv shouldn't be such a big part of your life that everything falls to pieces when a tv show changes timeslot.’

Nicole England agreed saying that after dinner should be 'quiet time’.

‘Sleep psychologists recommend no tv at least an hour prior to bedtime. In our house it's on for an hour while I'm preparing dinner and doesn't get turned back on.’ she said.

But the majority of parents could not agree less – expressing the show was an important part of their children’s night time routine.

One parent asked:‘What morons do you have working there? If it ain’t broke then don’t fix it! Night-time routine for toddlers completely ruined!’

‘im devastated...I need in the night garden at night...my world will end bc miss needs it to go to sleep!! I think this is a totally stupid decision!' Bree Elles declared.
