The leaders of all four main political parties yesterday threw their weight behind calls to keep the Tower of London’s poppies beyond Armistice Day.

They added their pleas to a growing campaign to extend the poignant tribute to Britain’s First World War dead for at least another week.

Despite the calls, Tower officials yesterday insisted that the lengthy job of taking away all the flowers would still begin on Wednesday – the day after Armistice Day.

Poppy panorama: Vistors for weeks have been treated to his magnificent display of red at the Tower of London - and want to see it stay beyond Armistice Day next week 

More than four million people have already viewed the sea of red ceramic flowers in the Tower's moat  

Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which operates the landmark, says 11,000 volunteers will take about two weeks to remove the near-900,000 ceramic flowers and post them to their new owners.

Shortly afterwards, a series of lucrative corporate winter parties will begin in a luxury pavilion in the moat area.

However, London Mayor Boris Johnson is in talks with Historic Royal Palaces to see if there is a way of extending the installation for at least another week.

David Cameron backed the move, and his official spokesman said last night: ‘He welcomes the fact that there are discussions under way.’

The work of art has captured the nation's imagination and attracted thousands of visitors each day 

The awe-inspiring and moving work of art has captured the nation’s imagination and is continuing to attract huge crowds of visitors despite enormous queues.

An online petition calling for the display to be kept at the Tower for a year has already attracted more than 20,000 signatures.

Adding his weight to the calls, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘I hope that a way can be found to extend this remarkable exhibition, and ensure that many more members of the public get the chance to pay their own personal tributes and see this extraordinary sight.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘I would love to see the display carry on further if the balance can be got right between extending it and making sure the charities which will benefit from the sale of the poppies still get the money they need.’

Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who was moved to tears when he viewed the display on Tuesday, added: ‘I told them myself they should be extending it because there are millions of people who would love to go and who just have not yet had the opportunity.’

A source close to Mr Johnson said talks about an extension were ongoing. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg have not yet visited the display. Labour did not respond to a question about whether Mr Miliband has been to see the display, called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red.

Nick Clegg, left, and Ukip leader Nigel Farage, right have also said that the installation should be extended 

All 888,246 poppies – one for each British and colonial death during the war – have now been sold at £25 each, with part of the estimated £15million proceeds shared between six service charities.

Historic Royal Palaces denied that it was unwilling to extend the display because of the planned pre-Christmas corporate events – the first of which is thought to be the annual business awards for the British Chambers of Commerce on November 27. The ice rink that is usually set up in the moat has already been cancelled to avoid causing a clash with the artwork.

A HRP spokesman said it was involved in ongoing discussions, but added: ‘The poppies will be removed from the moat starting on November 12, as planned. However, it has always been our intention that the installation would have a legacy beyond November 11.’
