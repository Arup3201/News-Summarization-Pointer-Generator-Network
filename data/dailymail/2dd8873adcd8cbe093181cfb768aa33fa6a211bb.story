A £2million truce was called yesterday in the bitter feud ripping through Gordon Ramsay's family and business empire.

The celebrity chef had accused his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising.

Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages.

Ramsay's kitchen nightmare: The TV chef (right) had declared war on his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson (left)... but the pair have reached a settlement

Ramsay's wife Tana sided with her 
husband and severed ties with her parents after discovering her 
philandering father had kept a second family secret from her for 30 
years.

But the very public spat is now at an
end after Ramsay and Hutcheson, his former business partner, friend and
close confidant, reached a £2million settlement, although the Kitchen 
Nightmares star has also run up a huge legal bill.

Ramsay's publicist, Freud 
Communications, said: 'Gordon Ramsay and Gordon Ramsay Holdings have 
reached a settlement with Chris Hutcheson and other members of the 
Hutcheson family.

'The terms of the settlement are 
confidential but we can confirm that Chris Hutcheson is no longer a 
director or shareholder of Gordon Ramsay Holdings and all civil 
litigation and employment tribunal claims brought by each of the two 
parties and other family members have been withdrawn.'

Hutcheson is believed to have received
about £2million, which includes payment for a 30 per cent share in 
Gordon Ramsay Holdings.

A source close to Ramsay, 44, said: 
'Gordon has spent a fortune to get to this point – not just on lawyers 
but accountants and computer experts. He wanted to sever every tie with 
his father-in-law, but of course it's meant Tana has had to pay a very 
heavy price.

'She doesn't expect to have any 
further contact with her father – nor even her mother because she's 
stood by him – but she feels as betrayed by him as Gordon does.

'Tana always puts their own family 
first and that's why she believes Gordon's done the right thing. She 
won't talk about it but there were things which her father did that 
disgust her.'

The TV cook alleged Hutcheson hacked into Ramsay's personal and company files

The slanging match between Ramsay and 
Hutcheson began 16 months ago when the TV cook sacked his father-in-law 
as chief executive of Gordon Ramsay Holdings.

Hutcheson, 63, branded Ramsay a 
celebrity-obsessed 'monster' and accused him of turning Tana against 
him. Ramsay, in an explosive public letter, revealed that he had 
employed private detectives to investigate Hutcheson and savaged the 
'dictator' father-in-law and 'his very complex life'.

It was not until May last year that 
the astonishing story behind Ramsay's decision to sack his business 
partner emerged when the High Court lifted a gagging order Hutcheson had
taken out to hush up his double life.

Tana Ramsay was among the last in her 
family to learn that for more than three decades Hutcheson had had a 
second, secret family after fathering two children by his mistress 
Frances Collins.

She is one of a string of women with 
whom Hutcheson allegedly betrayed his wife Greta, by whom he has four 
children, including Tana. Last summer Ramsay lodged a writ at the High 
Court suing Tana's father, mother, sister, brother and brother's wife.

The chef alleged that Hutcheson hacked
into his personal and company files, wrongly withdrew £1.42million from
the company to fund his double life and paid a separate mistress £5,000
a month.

Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself.

In December Ramsay was awarded 
£250,000 costs after a judge ruled that Hutcheson, Tana's sister Orlanda
Butland and her brother Adam were liable for breach of confidence after
hacking into personal emails and company computers.
