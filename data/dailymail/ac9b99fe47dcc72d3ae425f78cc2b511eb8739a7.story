'Offensive': Rod Liddle, the Spectator columnist, has come under fire for a blog where he described Mandela's death as 'nice black man dies'

Columnist Rod Liddle has been condemned for his dismissal of the news of the death of Nelson Mandela as 'famous nice black man dies'.

Liddle's comment was aimed at the BBC as the broadcaster came under fire for its round-the-clock coverage of the liberation hero's passing while storms batter Britain's North Sea coast.

He wrote on his Spectator blog: 'For Christ’s sake BBC, give it a bloody break for five minutes, will you?

'It’s as if the poor bugger now has to
bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant 
guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let’s re-run the entire history
of South Africa.

'That’s better than watching the country we’re in being flattened by a storm.'

The former editor of Radio 4's Today programme added: 'Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead.

'It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I came to the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill.

'I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion 20 years ago, or maybe 15. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.'

The
remarks were met with widespread opprobrium on Twitter. Aidan Barlow 
took to the social messaging service to describe Liddle's blog post as 
'really just like a maggot ... trying to describe a butterfly.'

Carl Packham added: 'Go home, Rod Liddle, you're an idiot.'

Elsewhere on the microblogging site, users described Liddle as 'odious', 'vile', 'sick', 'offensive' and 'a pointless, unremarkable human'.

Richard
Garside, director of the Centre For Crime And Justice Studies, used 
Twitter to publish a 'Rod Liddle decision tree', which described him as 
an 'attention seeking wind up merchant'.

However, Liddle was not the only person to question the outpouring of coverage of Mandela's death on the BBC while parts of Britain are drowning beneath the worst tidal surges for six decades.

Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford was also blasted on Twitter for criticising TV coverage surrounding the death - slamming the 'gargantuan montage' of the iconic leader being played on the news.

The long jumper was tweeting about Channel 4 show 'What Happens in Kavos' at 10pm last night when news broke that the legendary South African leader had died.

But responding to messages from some of his 138,242 followers telling him to watch the news, the 27-year-old launched a scathing attack on widespread coverage of Mandela's death.

Remarkably, the ginger-haired Olympian - who won gold at London 2012 - even slammed fellow celebrities for jumping on 'the band wagon' by tweeting RIP messages.

Rutherford tweeted: 'People, please stop telling me to put the news on. I am aware Mandela's dead, I don't need a gargantuan montage to remind me. Thank you.'

He then added: 'Getting an onslaught of abuse because I don't want to watch the news? Good lord it's tragic Mandela is dead I know.

'But I refuse to jump on the band wagon and join the RIP tweeting. I've read news reports & that's enough for me thank you.'

'I just wanted to watch something else...' British Olympic gold medallist Greg Rutherford was also condemned on Twitter after he complained about the wall-to-wall coverage on TV of Mandela's death last night

Hundreds of Twitter users blasted Rutherford for 'lacking respect' for not paying tribute to the iconic leader. @Katehillsley tweeted: 'how insensitive..lost all respect for you after that! Go take a running jump...'

And @Fahmida90 added: 'your lack of respect for the demise of a man who is held in the highest regards is shameful.'

Another Twitter user, @Annax1603, said: 'I can't believe how rude he is tbh! #norespectwhatsoever'

Defending himself after the barrage of abuse, Rutherford then tweeted: 'There is no disrespect. I agree with everyone the world lost an inspirational and great man. I just wanted to watch something else...'

Bizarrely he then posted a picture of Paris Hilton's tweeted tribute to Nelson Mandela along with the comment: 'Ok can the abuse stop now?'
