An actress from the hit comedy-drama Orange Is the New Black has accused her former friend of stalking her and allegedly bombarded her with emails and texts.

Taryn Manning, who plays Pennsatucky in the prison show, claims fashion designer Jeanine Heller allegedly she sent her hundreds of online messages as well as sending texts and calling between April and July.

Heller was arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court late Wednesday night charged with fourth degree stalking.

The New York Post's Page Six reported that Heller was released without bail and the judge Lisa Sokoloff prevented her from contacting the actress, her mother or the family dog, Penguin.

The judge added: 'The last person who violated my orders of protection is now in jail.'

The fashion designer did not comment to Page Six comment as she left court.

In addition to the calls and messages, in legal documents seen by TMZ, Taryn alleges her one time pal went 'on a campaign to make Taryn paranoid, claiming among other things one of Taryn's friends was selling secrets to a gossip website'. 

Jeannie is the founder of popular fashion parody label What About Yves, which is sold in celebrity-loved store Kitson.

The designer appears to have hinted at the drama between her and her former famous pal posting an inspirational quote on Instagram on Monday

Just five months ago the pair (Taryn second from right, Jeanine far right) were close enjoying a Palm Springs, California, holiday together.

The post said: 'People who are intimated by you talk bad about you with hopes that others won't find you so appealing.'

Her Instagram also shows that just five months ago the pair were close enjoying a Palm Springs, California, holiday together.

The designer was also Taryn's guest at an after hours event she hosted in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the end of March - just a month before the star alleges the stalking began.

In the hit show the actress plays Tiffany 'Pennsatucky' Doggett a born-again Christian crystal meth addict and after becoming a fans' favourite in the first series was promoted to a regular character.

She admitted that the character was a difficult role to prepare for, though she ended up relying on instinct.

She said: 'That’s a big question because she is ever changing.

'To start, I did a ton of research and reading, and then decided to just get weird!'

The 35-year-old is also a fashion designer and vocalist in the electronic duo Boomkat.

The popular Netflix show is currently in its second season, and has been renewed for a third.

It has been nominated for a People's Choice Award for Favourite Streaming Series and several Writers Guild of America Awards for New Series, Comedy Series, and Episodic Comedy.
