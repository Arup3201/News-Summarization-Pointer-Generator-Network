Britain is lagging behind Croatia and Turkey in the number of road improvements carried out in the last year, a damning new international league-table of highway upgrades and maintenance across Europe reveals today (Fri)

Analysis across 30 European countries by map and sat-nav experts TomTom show that 115,994 new roundabouts, carriageway lanes and one-way streets were created in the UK over the last 12 months.

But this only places the UK at seventh place in the European league table, behind sixth place Turkey (118,352 improvements) and fifth place Croatia (129,301) which was part of the former Balkan state of Yugoslavia.

France topped the list with 263,409 road improvements, followed by Germany (169,111), Spain (145,641) and Italy (144,571).

The damning data emerged after TomTom recorded more than 1.5 million road changes across Europe in the past year - the first time that such detailed road change information has been mapped.

It comes just days after Government announced controversial plans to privatise the major road system, and in the wake of a highly critical ‘ALARM’ report on the parlous state of the nation’s increasingly potholed and crumbling highways.

But the TomTom report says: ‘Despite the huge growth in population and car ownership, it seems that investment in the UK’s road infrastructure is lagging behind other European countries.’

Earlier this week Prime Minister David Cameron announced controversial Government plans to privatise England’s motorway and major trunk roads which could be run and maintained by private sector firms and investors, as well as allowing them to charge pay-as-you drive tolls on new roads or lanes which they create.

The aim is to improve the biggest and busiest roads on the UK’s ailing 362,598 mile road network. Traffic congestion costs the UK economy about £7bn a year according to Government estimates.

TomTom managing director Corinne Vigreux said:’The road network is constantly changing. New roads are built and the layout of older roads adapted, with extra roundabouts, lanes and one-ways added in. We need to ensure that every single change is tracked so that drivers are up to date.

‘TomTom has used its own unique methodology to measure and quantify all of these map changes and state the numbers are accurate.’

She added: ‘Given the huge number of 
road changes in the UK every year, it is vital that drivers update the 
map on their satnav device when new maps become available. Otherwise 
it’s like driving round with last year’s road atlas.’

TomTom
used detection systems to record map changes country by country 
throughout 2010 and 2011. In addition to satellite imagery and mobile 
mapping vans, geographic analysts used field surveys plus national and 
local source material to capture the changes.

The map statistics also come hard on the heels of the Government’s ‘satnav summit’ designed to encourage local authorities and mapping companies to work more closely on communicating changes to the road network.

TomTom said its mapping teams work around the clock to track down every single change across the globe so that their sat-nav systems are completely up to date. It also consults with local Governments and transportation authorities to build a real-time map.

Motorists are already enduring a ‘pothole pandemic’ as a £10billion backlog in crumbling road repairs is tackled by short-term and expensive patch-and-mend hole-filling, a major report revealed last week.

The authoritative dossier backed by the AA reveals that the number of potholes filled in across England and Wales has nearly doubled in five years to almost 1.7 million. But the millions spent is a ‘ridiculous waste’ of taxpayers’ money as it fails to tackle the underlying problems and is simply ‘plastering over the cracks,’ said the Annual Local Authority Road maintenance (‘ALARM’) report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA).

It is also ‘at least 20 times more expensive’ to patch and mend’ than to plan proper road maintenance, it says.

The last three winter cold snaps alone have added an estimated £1.34billion to the nation’s repair bill, it notes.

Critics said it was ‘a disaster’ and ‘putting lives at risk.’ Council chiefs admitted they were filling potholes ‘at a rate of one every 18 seconds’ but ‘chasing their tails’ on patching up roads rather than fixing them properly.

Even as things stand it will take English councils 11 years to clear the road maintenance backlog, while Welsh councils will take 17 years, said the report. And some roads will go for nearly 100 years without being resurfaced at all, it reveals.

Councils in England and Wales have a total annual road maintenance funding shortfall of nearly £800million, with the average for each English council being £5.3million. Road maintenance budgets fell by an average of 13 per cent last year to a total of £2.5 billion.

As a result, one in five (20 per cent) of local roads have only five years of live left in them - dropping to 1 in 4 (27 per cent) in London.
