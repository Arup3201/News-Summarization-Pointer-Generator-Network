Motorways are becoming so congested that motorists should get used to driving at 40mph, according to the civil servant in charge of Britain’s roads.

Graham Dalton, the chief executive of the Highways Agency, said roads are getting ‘slower and slower’, and suggested there was now an unofficial target of 40mph during busy periods.

Mr Dalton, who has been the agency’s chief executive for the past six years, said motorway speeds were ‘getting more predictable, but slower and slower’ and this ‘is not acceptable’.

Graham Dalton, the chief executive of the Highways Agency, said roads are getting 'slower and slower'

He told Civil Service World magazine: ‘If you’re driving down the M6 to come to work in Birmingham every morning, we’ve got to the point where 50mph or 40mph is acceptable, and the target is to make it 40mph every weekday morning.’

The Agency is in charge of maintaining 4,300 miles of England’s motorways and A roads. Four million vehicles use the roads daily.

Shadow Environment Secretary Mary Creagh says people will be shocked to hear that 40 mph is the best drivers can hope for on some motorways

Mary Creagh, the shadow Transport secretary, told the Telegraph: ‘People will be shocked to hear that 40 mph is the best drivers can hope for and shocked by ministers’ complacency.

‘We need a national plan for our road and rail networks so they can support the jobs and growth our country needs.

‘This startling admission is an indictment of this Government’s decision to slash spending on our motorways and cancel many road projects that would have tackled congestion and increased speed and reliability on our motorways.’

Britain is ranked 24th in the world for its roads behind many other developed countries such as France, according to the magazine.

A Highways Agency spokesman said: ‘There is no target for managing average motorway traffic flows at speeds below 70mph.

‘The Highways Agency has been successful in making journeys more reliable and predictable – now we need to make them quicker as well.’

Officials said that an example of this was the agency’s ‘smart motorways programme, which adds an extra lane, with the default speed limit of 70mph’.
