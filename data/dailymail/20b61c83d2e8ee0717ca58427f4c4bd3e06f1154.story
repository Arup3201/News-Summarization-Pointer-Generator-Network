Theresa May tonight blocked a bid by the Labour MP Keith Vaz to conduct a high-profile interrogation of the boss of MI5.

Mr Vaz had wanted his Westminster committee to be allowed to question Andrew Parker over the damage caused by the Guardian’s Edward Snowden revelations.

The session would have been guaranteed enormous TV coverage and publicity.

But, to the fury of Mr Vaz, the Home Secretary has intervened to stop the committee’s plans.

At the same time, Prime Minister David Cameron refused a similar request for the national security adviser to give evidence.

Mr Vaz responded by threatening to haul Mrs May before his committee more often.

The row centres on the decision by the Guardian to print intelligence secrets stolen by the fugitive US National Security Agency operative Snowden, who is currently holed-up in Russia.

Mr Parker says that, by disclosing surveillance techniques used by spies to monitor emails and the internet, the newspaper has handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and put lives at risk.

Some Labour MPs are keen for him to give specific examples.

In an historic first, Mr Parker – flanked by the heads of MI6 and GCHQ - gave evidence to Westminster’s Intelligence and Security Committee on the subject last month.

The ISC is conducting its own probe into Snowden and yesterday announced a ‘call for evidence’ on whether the right balance is being struck between privacy and national security.

Alan Rusbridger, the Editor of the Guardian newspaper, carried a copy of Peter Wright's book Spycatcher as he arrived to be questioned by the committee on December 3

But Mr Vaz decided his committee should have its own turn at quizzing Mr Parker, and issued a formal invite last week.

Mrs May, who is the Cabinet Minister in charge of MI5, yesterday intervened to block the request.

She said any appearance would ‘duplicate’ the existing oversight provided by the ISC.

A similar request for Kim Darroch, the Prime Minister’s security adviser, to give evidence was blocked by Mr Cameron.

He said ‘it was not a good idea’ because Mr Darroch's role focused on providing private advice to him.

The Home Office and Number Ten were concerned about setting a ‘precedent’ in which Mr Vaz and MPs could regularly haul security chiefs in front of the cameras.

Mr Cameron said it should be left to the Home Secretary to give evidence to the MPs over the Snowden row. She is due to appear before Mr Vaz’s committee on Monday.

Mr Vaz responded: ‘I am disappointed by the Prime Minister’s and Home Secretary’s responses, which are not helpful to the Committee’s inquiry into Counter Terrorism.

‘We cannot play pass the parcel on the issue of accountability on these important issues.

‘Ministers should take care not to dictate to Parliamentary Committees which witnesses can be called and for what reasons. Witnesses, no matter how senior, should not be afraid of answering questions from MPs.

‘As a result of this correspondence our session with the Home Secretary next Monday will be longer and more detailed than we originally anticipated, and she needs to prepare to come before the Committee more often.’

Kat Craig, legal director at human rights charity Reprieve said: ‘This is a scandalous attempt by the Government to insulate itself and the security services from anything even approaching genuine accountability.

‘Theresa May’s claim that the Intelligence and Security Committee is providing real “oversight” would be laughable were it not so depressing.  

‘This is a committee which has missed every scandal from UK complicity in rendition and torture to the more recent revelations on excessive surveillance.’
