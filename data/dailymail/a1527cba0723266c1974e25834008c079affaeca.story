Buckingham Palace was a hive of activity today as dozens descended on the Royal household to receive honours, presented by the Princess Royal.

Meanwhile the Queen greeted Marguerite Pindling, the Governor-General of the Bahamas.

Announced as Goveror-General on 8 July 2014, Marguerite is the widow of the former Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Lynden Pindling.

She was welcomed by the Queen in her drawing room and invested with the Insignia of a Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George.

The Queen and Marguerite chatted animatedly, with both having chosen tailored over-the-knee skirts  and low-heeled patent shoes for the meeting.

But while Her Royal Highness opted for a gentle pink shade for her skirt and matching top, teaming her outfit with a black handbag and delicate multi-strand pearl necklace, Dame Marguerite chose a vibrant turquoise with matching sequinned bag.

Elsewhere in the Palace, members of the sporting and entertainment elite were also being honoured.

Adding a touch of showbiz to the event was Torchwood star and musical theatre veteran John Barrowman who was awarded with a MBE by the Princess Royal.

The Scottish-born American actor paid homage to his heritage by wearing a red tartan kilt and traditional sporran.

Also recognised at the investiture was Martin Hewitt, Assistant Commissioner, Metropolitan Police, who received the Queen's Police Medal, and sporting stars Kelly Gallagher and Charlotte Evans.

The pair were awarded MBEs following their historic victory at the Winter Paralympics.

Gallagher, a visually impaired skier, and Evans, her sighted partner, became the first Britons to win an Olympic or Paralympic title on snow when they came first in the women's visually impaired Super-G event in Sochi, Russia, earlier this year.

Speaking after the Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony hosted by the Princess Royal, Gallagher said: 'We've been really lucky to win a Paralympic medal but to be honoured in this way is incredible.'

Evans, who guides her sports partner by skiing ahead and communicating via a headset as they travel at speeds of up to 75mph, said 'I don't think anything compares to it.'

Britain's most accomplished female golfer Laura Davies was also made a Dame.

The sportswoman, a professional since the mid-1980s, has already been awarded an MBE and CBE in previous honours.

Dame Laura said: 'This is my 30th year on tour and I'm still going strong. I was in Malaysia on Sunday, then I fly back out to China for the next tournament - it's all go.

'I just love to compete, I love to try and win and I still play well - there's nothing more I would rather be doing.'

The sportswoman described her first major as the highlight of her career: 'I think the US Open in 1987 when I wasn't even a member of the tour in America and went over there as complete unknown and came back with a major trophy.

'I guess that was the big one that got everything going for me.'
