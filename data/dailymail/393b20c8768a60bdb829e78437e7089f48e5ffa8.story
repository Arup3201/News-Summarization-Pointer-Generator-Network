Google has beaten Apple to unveil its plans for wearable computers.

The firm today launched its 'Android Wear' project which will give developers a special version of Google phone and tablet software they can run on watches and other devices.

It showed off two concept watches, available in round and square versions, that respond to voice commands and also have a touchscreen.

Google has revealed a 'developer version' of its watch, which it promises will go on sale 'very soon'

The Google watch has both a touchscreen and voice recognition.

It can:

Control Music

Display texts and emails

Reply to texts using voice

Show directions

Display alerts such as flight details and appointments from Google's Now service

Receive posts and updates from social apps,

Show chats from messaging apps

Show normal app notifications

The firm also said it is working with LG, Samsung, Motorola and others to include the software in their watches.

'Watches are good at telling time, but imagine having useful, actionable information there precisely where you need it, automatically,' said David Singleton, Google's head of Android Engineering.

'We are working wit watch makers, fashion brands and chip companies.'

The firm said the move into wearables was an obvious one.

'Most of us are rarely without our smartphones in hand,' said Sundar Pichai, Google's Android boss.

'These powerful supercomputers keep us connected to the world and the people we love.

'But we're only at the beginning; we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with mobile technology.

That’s why we’re so excited about wearables—they understand the context of the world around you, and you can interact with them simply and efficiently, with just a glance or a spoken word.

'Today we’re announcing Android Wear, a project that extends Android to wearables,' Pichai said.

'And we’re starting with the most familiar wearable—watches.

'Going well beyond the mere act of just telling you the time, a range of new devices along with an expansive catalogue of apps will give you useful information when you need it most.

'Android Wear shows you info and suggestions you need, right when you need them.'

The watch will use Google's existing Now service, which gives 'smart' alerts by looking at emails, calender and other today to warn of upcoming appointments, delayed flights and other information.

It can also tell users when they need to leave for their next appointment after looking at live traffic data, for instance. 

The watch is shown in both round and square versions, and Google will make the software available to other manufacturers

It has a touchscreen and also voice control built in, and Google will build a special app store for wearable software

Google is also developing a special app store for its wearable products, it was revealed.

'The wide variety of Android applications means you’ll receive the latest posts and updates from your favorite social apps, chats from your preferred messaging apps, notifications from shopping, news and photography apps, and more.'

The watch shown off uses a touchscreen and voice control.

Just say “Ok Google” to ask questions, like how many calories are in an avocado, what time your flight leaves, and the score of the game,' the firm said.

The watch will use speech recognition to allow people to reply to texts and other messages

It can also update users with sports scores - and even work out which teams they support by looking at Google searches

Or say “Ok Google” to get stuff done, like calling a taxi, sending a text, making a restaurant reservation or setting an alarm.

'The ability to better monitor your health and fitness.

'Hit your exercise goals with reminders and fitness summaries from Android Wear.

Your favorite fitness apps can give you real-time speed, distance and time information on your wrist for your run, cycle or walk.'
