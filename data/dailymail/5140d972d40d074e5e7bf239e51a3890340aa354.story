Wojciech Szczesny took Arsenal's youngsters under his wing to do a bit of sightseeing in New York.

The Gunners keeper and a host of starlets like Chuba Akpom, Kris Olsson and Francis Coquelin rode the subway before visiting the Top of the Rock in the Rockefeller Centre.

The young Gunners - who also had Nacho Monreal in tow - took in the stunning view of the city from the summit, which stands 70 floors up.

Arsenal's tour schedule kicks off with an emotional reunion with Gunners icon Thierry Henry as they face the New York Red Bulls.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger insists Henry still has it - and joked he wanted him to turn out for his  side in the exhibition game. 

Wenger said: ‘I came here with only one striker because I hoped he would play one half for us. He practises with us and is still very sharp and he came back here in very good shape.’

Akpom is the only recognised striker in Arsenal's touring party.
