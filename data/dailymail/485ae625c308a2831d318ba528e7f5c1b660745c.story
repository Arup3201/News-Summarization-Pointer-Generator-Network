James Anderson has dismissed Kevin Pietersen's suggestion that the sacked batsman could play for England again in future should there be changes among the ECB hierarchy.

Pietersen's England career has looked over ever since he was sacked following the Ashes debacle last winter, and relations have turned even uglier following the batsman's bitter criticism of the national set-up in his recently released autobiography.

But the South Africa-born star - the top runscorer in England's history - has suggested he still wants to play international cricket and could do so should Giles Clarke be replaced as chairman of the ECB.

Anderson, however, poured cold water on that idea. 'I can’t really see a way back after what’s been said,' said England's all-time leading wicket-taker, who was a team-mate of Pietersen's throughout the highly successful period under Andy Flower's leadership, which included three Ashes triumphs and lifting the Twenty20 World Cup.

Pietersen has felt aggrieved at the way his international career appears to have ended and used his book, KP: The Autobiography, to heavily criticise the ECB, former boss Flower and some of his former team-mates, most notably Matt Prior.

'It’s been an interesting week or so. It’s sad that all the stuff that’s come out has been about a really successful period of cricket,' said Anderson. 'I loved every minute of that. It’s a shame that this overshadows it.

'He was such an amazing player, one of the best, if not the best batsmen we’ve ever had.'

Pietersen alleged that there was a 'bullying' culture in the England dressing room, in which the bowlers forced fielders to apologise for mistakes made and players were afraid to stand up for themselves.

Prior, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad were cited as being the ringleaders of a powerful clique in the dressing room, which Pietersen said made for a fractious team atmosphere.

Again, however, Anderson gave Pietersen's claims short shrift.

'The dressing room was a really nice play to be,' he said. 'When you’re in a winning successful dressing room, everyone enjoys being there.'

'What I remember of the dominance of those three was that they chose what music went on the ipod.'

Jimmy Anderson was speaking ahead of his appearance on The Clare Balding Show which airs Thursday 16th October at 10:15pm on BT Sport 1.
