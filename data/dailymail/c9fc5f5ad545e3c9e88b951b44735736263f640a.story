A new poll has revealed Britain's widening gulf with the rest of the European Union and suggested attitudes are hardening towards our membership on both sides of the Channel.

The four-nation survey of attitudes to Europe carried out by Opinium shows British people regard the EU much more negatively than citizens of other countries.

Research from Germany, France and Poland also suggests citizens of other countries think Britain brings few benefits to the union.

According to the study, more people on the continent seem happy to see Britain leave than seem keen for the UK to stay.

More than 2,000 people were surveyed in the UK and more than 1,000 in each of Germany, France and Poland as part of the research commissioned by The Observer.

Figures show only 26 per cent of Britons believe the EU is a 'good thing' compared with 62 per cent of Poles, 55 per cent of Germans and 36 per cent of French.

Just 14 per cent of Brits polled regard themselves as 'European' with 48 per cent of Poles, 39 per cent of Germans and 34 per cent of French.

Results from the four-nation poll by Opinium show the widening gulf between Britain and other EU countries

And, while most people in Germany, 
France and Poland name a fellow European country as their closest ally, 
Brits name fellow English-speaking countries.

The
study showed 33 per cent of Brits named the U.S., 31 per cent named 
Australia and 23 per cent named Canada as Britain's closest ally.

As for Britain's involvement in the EU, 24 per cent of French respondents say a British exit would have a negative effect on the EU, compared with 36 per cent of Germans.

Poles were more concerned about a British exit, with 51 per cent saying the effect would be negative.

The polling finds very high levels of concern about the EU's effect on immigration among British, French and German citizens.

Polls suggest 64 per cent of Brits are concerned, along with 59 per cent of French people and 42 per cent of Germans.

Only 20 per cent of Poles regard the effect on immigration as negative.
