Irish jockey Davy Russell, in action at Newbury on Wednesday afternoon, can ride his Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Lord Windermere in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on December 28 after his five-day ban for taking the whip of colleague Philip Enright during a race was reduced to two days.

Russell grabbed the whip of Enright, who had a similar ban reduced, at Clonmel after dropping his own at the first hurdle. Both jockeys will miss this Saturday and Sunday.
