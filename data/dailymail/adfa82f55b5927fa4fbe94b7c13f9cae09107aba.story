Ordeal: Connie Brooker, 31, was threatened that her 15-month-old daughter Freya would be taken into care if she couldn't explain how she suffered burns while at nursery

A couple were threatened with having their daughter taken into care after they took her to A&E with third degree burns she suffered while at nursery.

Connie and Terry Brooker rushed their 15-month-old daughter Freya to hospital after they picked her up from nursery and found she had severe blisters and burns on her fingers that staff couldn’t explain.

But when the couple, from Gloucester, told doctors they didn’t know how Freya had been injured, medics refused to let her go home with them.

It was only when social services stepped in and Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery in Quedgeley, Gloucester, admitted liability for Freya’s injuries that the couple were allowed to take their daughter home.

Nursery nurse Mrs Brooker, 31, said: 'It was our worst nightmare come true. We didn’t know what had happened when Freya was at nursery but she came out with burns on her hand.

'We just wanted to get her poor little hand sorted and suddenly we were the ones under suspicion.'

Gloucestershire County Council spokesperson said said it is working closely with Ofsted in the wake of the incident and 'regular nursery inspections are taking place'.

But the council refused to say whether social services could still remove Freya from her parents.

Mrs Brooker picked up her daughter Freya from nursery school to find two of her fingers were blistered and red raw.

She asked staff at Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery what had happened, but claims she was told the toddler was fine and the injuries were from Freya sucking on her fingers.

Mrs and Mr Brooker, 33, a machine operator, were not convinced and sought advice from a local nurse who suspected it was a burn but told the couple to leave it 24 hours.

But when her blisters worsened they rushed straight to A&E at Gloucester Royal Hospital where staff told them that if they couldn’t explain what happened to cause Freya’s injuries, she would be taken away from them and placed in the care of social services.

It was only when social services visited the nursery that staff admitted Freya had burned her hand in their care. Freya was then released back into her parents' care.

Admission: It was only when Teddy Bear's Picnic Day Nursery in Gloucester admitted liabilities for Freya's injuries that she was allowed back into her parents' care

Mrs Brooker said: 'It was a relief to 
hear the nursery admit liability but it did not relieve the distress 
about how my baby had been burnt.'

Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundations Trust insists hospital staff were just following protocol.

A spokesman said: 'When a child arrives at our Emergency Department with injuries, we answer a series of set questions on the front of that child’s patient records.

'These questions will look at whether there has been a delay in seeking treatment, if there are unusual or multiple injuries, a history of injury or confusion about how the injury occurred.

'If unclear, then the assessing doctor or practitioner will ask further questions and may seek assistance from a senior colleague or on occasion, to social care colleagues.

'It is important to emphasise that this is no reflection on parents or responsible adults who bring in their injured child for treatment, but we believe parents will understand the need to ensure that children are safe to be discharged following treatment.

'We cannot comment on this particular case, but if the family have any concerns about their experience, we would encourage them to get in touch with our Patient Advice and Liaison Team to enable us to look into those concerns.'

Distressing: Connie and Terry Brooker, pictured with their daughter Freya, described their experience at hospital as their 'worst nightmare come true'

Unexplained: Teddy Bear's Picnic Day Nursery conducted a week long inquiry into Freya's burns but is still unable to say how she got them

Freya was referred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where she was treated for third degree burns to her fingers.

Mrs
 Brooker said: 'For the nursery to suggest that her third degree burns 
were a result of her sucking her fingers was just ludicrous.'

The couple are still in the dark about what actually happened to their child, who has been left with scarring.

Mrs Brooker said: 'Freya wasn’t showing 
many signs of distress initially but this is because it turns out her 
hand was so badly burnt she had lost feeling in it.

'I don’t understand how something 
like this can happen at a nursery and go unnoticed. I just want someone 
to explain what has happened to my daughter.'

On the mend: Freya, pictured, was treated for third degree burns at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol

Teddy
 Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery has admitted liability for Freya’s injuries 
and conducted a week long inquiry into the incident but no reason 
for her injuries has been supplied.

She
 said: 'It was first suggested by the nursery that Freya was burned by 
her baby food, but the reports from the day recorded all the food 
temperature and this possibility was discounted by the consultant at 
Frenchay due to the nature of the burn.'

Another suggestion was Freya burnt her hand on an exposed radiator pipe, but Mrs Brooker claims the the burns consultant said her daughter’s hand would have to have been pressed against the pipe for a long time to sustain her injuries.

Mrs Brooker said: 'We hate the thought of anything happening to our daughter, and other children while in the care of nurseries and we just want to know what happened so we can prevent it happening again.

'We have been through hell with this.
 My daughter has been left with scars on her hand and she is too young 
to tell us what happened.

'It
 is not acceptable for these incidents to be dismissed as a result of 
normal baby behaviour and we just want to get to the bottom of it.'

Mr Brooker said: 'We have had only had verbal apologies, nothing in writing. It really is not good enough.'

The couple have consulted solicitors and are now pursuing legal action against Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day Nursery and the police are investigating further.

A
 spokesperson from Teddy Bear’s Picnic Day nursery said: 'We are working
 with all relevant authorities in respect of the investigation.

'As the proceedings are ongoing, we are unable to comment further.'

A
 spokesperson from Gloucestershire Police, said: 'Our public protection 
bureau is currently investigating the cause of an injury to a child at a
 nursery in Quedgeley.

'No
 arrests have been made in connection with the case and as inquiries are
 ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.'

Unknown cause: Several possible causes for Freya's burns have been suggested by the nursery - including that she was burnt by her baby food or by an exposed radiator
