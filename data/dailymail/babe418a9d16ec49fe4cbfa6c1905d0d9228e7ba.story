A major operation to airlift thousands of tonnes of military equipment from Afghanistan has begun as the senior UK commander there warned cutting troop numbers could 'endanger' progress.

Lieutenant-General Nick Carter, deputy chief of Nato's International Security Assistance Force, revealed the progress of handing over control of security and the fight against the Taliban after 12 years was going well.

But he said that cutting the number of 
boots on the ground below that already planned as part of the withdrawal
from the country, during the summer fighting season, would be 
'unforgivable'.

He also said that British troops could be involved in combat operations right up to the planned end of a Nato presence in the country at the end of next year.

Lt Gen Carter told the Independent: 'It 
would be unforgivable if we allowed the gains of the last three years to
be lost because we were not able to provide the Afghans with the 
support to take this through into 2014.

'Our judgment is we have to manage this 
in a way that retains confidence. Precipitating withdrawal that is not 
in line with the current plan will damage Afghan confidence.'

The warning came as what could be seen as the biggest 
spring clean in the world begun, a redeployment effort will see everything 
from nuts and bolts to helicopters and armoured vehicles returned to the
UK.

The British presence will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200. All combat operations in the country should be over by the end of 2014, leaving Afghan forces in control.

The plan is to leave as little as possible behind.

At Camp Bastion, the main operating 
base in Helmand which has grown to the size of a town, there are now 
expanses of dust where canvas villages once stood as empty tents are 
removed.

From the heavily-armoured 15-tonne 
Mastiff and 20-tonne Buffalo mine protected trucks to far smaller 
trailers and buggies, battlefield vehicles sit parked up in a 
700-capacity compound.

Used and out-of-date ammunition is 
collected ready to be sold for scrap. Since January some £70 million 
worth of British equipment has left Afghanistan and this is expected to 
increase rapidly as the withdrawal gathers pace.

Lieutenant Charles Ashington-Pickett 
explained that as well as ensuring nothing goes to waste, the process 
should prevent weapons and other potentially lethal equipment going 
astray.

'We class this material as ACTO, meaning attractive to criminal and terrorist organisations,' he said.
'This ranges from weapons and ammunition to radios, cameras and batteries.

'His unit is responsible for taking stock of all kit that is returned as more advanced bases close or scale down.'

Bases which will for the time being 
continue to operate are encouraged to de-clutter to ensure they are 
ready to pack up quickly when the time comes.

Until the beginning of this year 
roughly £500,000 worth of equipment each month moved through six huge 
canvas warehouses at Camp Bastion.

Some equipment is reused within Afghanistan but increasingly it is being flown back to the UK

They are now handling 60 times as much at about £30 million each month. Some is reused within Afghanistan but increasingly it is being flown 
back to the UK. Once home it will either be kept ready for future 
conflicts or sold to other countries.

Major Katie Lamont's unit is 
responsible for sorting and packaging the loads. One of their roles is 
to handle spent ammunition and live rounds which can no longer be used. 
These will be melted down as scrap metal.

The high brass and steel content means the decommissioned rounds can be sold for £2,000 per tonne.

'By the end of this week we will have
transported 320 tonnes of ammunition back to the UK since January,' Maj
Lamont said. 'One aircraft can carry 80 tonnes worth about £160,000.

'The cost of the flight is about £20,000 so it represents good value for money.'

Unwanted armoured vehicles will go 
through an advanced service, similar to an MOT, and a high powered 
chemical car wash to ensure no insects or contamination are brought back
to the UK.

Staff sergeant Paul Dunning, whose 
team of engineers are coming to the end of a six month tour, expects to 
have serviced 370 vehicles ready to return by the time they leave this 
month.

Those in charge stress that the fight
is not over. British troops still import more equipment than they 
export but this balance is shifting as the 2014 deadline approaches.

Like a family preparing to relocate, 
the military is keen to get its house in order so that when the time to 
leave does come, it will be ready for a swift and fuss-free exit.
