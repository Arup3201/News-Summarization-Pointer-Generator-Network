Energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs, making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal.

A damning investigation by consumer champions at Which? found customer service staff were failing to give families clear tariff information a staggering 95 per cent of the time.

Historically, bills have been so complicated that it has been impossible for customers to understand how much gas and electricity they are using and the price per unit.

The industry regulator Ofgem responded in March by introducing a new system requiring energy companies to give a Tariff Comparison Rate (TCR) for each energy type.

The TCR is similar to an APR for credit cards and tells householders how much a tariff costs per kilowatt hour (kWh) based on medium usage for both gas and electricity.

The idea is that householders should be able to ask companies for their TCR in order to get some idea as to which offers the lowest bills.

Which? called 13 energy companies six times each – making a total of 78 – asking them to explain the TCR and how it works, however they only managed to provide the correct information on four occasions.

The consumer group said the calculation to work out the TCR is so complicated that it is little better than the old system.

It involves multiplying the energy unit price by Ofgem’s average consumption figures – 3,200 kWh for electricity and 13,500 kWh for gas. You then add a year’ s standing charge and subtract any discounts, before adding VAT at 20per cent.

You then divide the figure by 3,200 for electric or 13,500 for gas to give a TCR for each energy type in pence per kWh.

Energy firms are keeping customers in the dark about their tariffs, making it difficult for people to shop around for the cheapest deal.

Previous Which? research makes clear the TCR system is of little help to customers and it wants Ofgem to require suppliers to adopt a much simpler petrol pump style system for tariffs.

An earlier study found that just three in ten consumers - 28 per cent - got the right answer when asked to identify the cheapest deal from a range of tariffs using the TCR.

This shot up to 84 per cent when people used the simple petrol pump style tariff favoured by Which?

The group’s executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: ‘If the energy companies can’t even explain how to accurately compare tariffs then their customers stand no chance.

‘It is clear suppliers need to up their game and ensure they can provide consumers with a clear and accurate explanation to help them find the best deal.

‘Energy pricing is still far too complicated, which is why we want the government to introduce simpler pricing, similar to petrol pump displays, so people can spot the cheapest deal at a glance.’

Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and said an increasing number are shopping around

Energy UK, which speaks for suppliers, insisted customers can easily compare tariffs and an increasing number are shopping around.

‘Hundreds of thousands of customers are changing electricity supplier every month and new research from Ipsos MORI has shown that 74 per cent of recent switchers found it easy to change supplier,’ it said.

‘The new Tariff Comparison Rate gives customers an indication of whether they are on the best deal but it is not the only way to compare tariffs. 

'All consumer bills now tell you how much you can save by changing to a different deal with the same supplier. 

'Not only that, switching sites offer customers the chance to compare deals from across the market at the click of a button.’

It added: ‘Energy deals cannot be compared in the same way as petrol pump prices as there are number of additional factors influencing the amount a customer pays. 

'These include the customer’s location and government legislation which applies to some companies and not others. However, this does not mean it is hard to find a good deal.

‘Energy UK supports transparency and simplicity. 

'Hundreds of thousands of people are switching every month. There are plenty of deals out there so customers should log on to a comparison site or call their supplier to see if they can save money by switching.'

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year. 

Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

Don't forget, prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.
