Every bride hopes to impress her groom when she first appears at the head of the aisle, and in this instance, she certainly succeeded, judging by a touching set of wedding photos currently making the internet rounds.

Groom Jai Kamat, 26, an artist based in New York, is captured displaying a roller coaster of profound emotion in response to his bride Julie Kamat, also 26; from tension, to delight, to all-out tear-suppressing joy.

'That’s just how I am,' Mr Kamat told ABC News. 'Seeing it plastered on the Internet is kind of strange.'

The tear-jerking photos were snapped by Lauren Benson, the groom's cousin, who says she had her shutter going 'rapid fire' to capture his colorful array of expressions.

Mr Kamat married his college sweetheart on Memorial Day in May, at Orlando's Disney World Florida.

For the proud new husband, it was perhaps the end to his year-long wait to see the wedding gown Julie had settled on, which brought on such a on overwhelmed reaction.

Married: Mrs Kamat (pictured) had kept the details of her dress a secret from her fiance in the lead up to the wedding, and when he finally saw it, he says it was 'surreal'

'We’d been planning the wedding for about one year and Julie had been holding out on what her dress looked like,' he explains.

'I was really happy and trying to hold back tears at the same time'

'When those doors opened and she walked out it was kind of surreal. Everyone was there, all our friends and family, and I was really happy and trying to hold back tears at the same time.

'It was a lot to take in at once.'

Down to earth: Mrs Kamat wasn't surprised by her now-husband's wedding performance, or his subsequent internet fame

You might expect his new wife Julie to be exceptionally smug with her husband's outburst of loving appreciation at their wedding, and his subsequent internet fame.

Not entirely.

'She sort of rolled her eyes because she’s used to it,' Mr Kamat says. 'She was like, "Oh, boy, here we go."'
