Facebook can often seem like a rather unhealthy habit these days, as we spend hours mindlessly checking our news feeds or uploading vain selfies.

But for one overweight mother the social networking site proved to be just the kick she needed to shape up and get healthy when an unflattering photo shamed her into losing an incredible 8st in weight.

Tracy Nicholson, 34, a childcare provider, ditched fatty snacks after she was horrified by a photo of her enjoying a night out with friends.

Miss Nicholson, a mother of two from 
Cramlington in Northumberland, said: 'I uploaded the picture but regretted 
it immediately. I was suddenly very anxious about what people would 
think about me - about how I could have let myself become so overweight.

'I was horrified - and knew I had to stop making excuses and do something about it.'

Miss Nicholson began putting on weight after she left school and struggled to control her overeating following the birth of her son Dylan, now 8, and daughter Chloe, 5.

By the winter of 2012 Miss Nicholson, whose partner James Shaw, 37, works as a painter and decorator, weighed 19st 2lb.

She said: 'I’d fallen into the habit of snacking on crisps and eating chocolate and thought nothing of routinely ordering a takeaway when I got to the weekend.

'I never had any energy and keeping up with the children was proving to be increasingly difficult. James said he didn’t care about my size, but it was starting to get me down.

'When I put the picture on Facebook, I was mortified. I didn’t want other people to see me that way.'

Tracey has banned crisps from her diet and totally eliminated snacking, joining a slimming club to give her moral support during her weight loss

Shortly afterwards Miss Nicholson attended a GP appointment where her weight was confirmed.

She joined a local slimming group where she drew up an eating plan which permanently banned crisps from her daily diet.

While she 
was overweight, she had typically eaten two slices of toast for 
breakfast, followed by a cheese sandwich and a packet of salt and 
vinegar crisps for lunch, followed by an evening meal of sausage and 
chips. She would snack on crisps and chocolate with coffee throughout 
the day.

Today,
 she usually has fruit or boiled eggs for breakfast, then ham salad with
 beetroot and pickled onions for lunch, followed by a handful of pasta 
with cheese in the evening. Instead of snacks, she usually treats 
herself to a cup of fruit tea.

She said: 'I gave myself four weeks - that’s how long I thought I’d last at slimming club. But by the end of the fifth week I was still there, and I was amazed to find that I’d lost a stone and a half. As I kept losing more and more, I was only more motivated to keep going with the eating plan.'

Today, Miss Nicholson weighs 11st 2lb.

She said: 'I have so much more energy now and keeping up with the kids is great fun - we race each other on the school run.

'James always loved me the way I was, but it’s something that I had to do for myself. I’m so glad I managed to keep going, when I only gave myself a few weeks to start with.

'My life has changed out of all recognition - I feel so much better now, and I don’t worry about putting photos on Facebook any more.'
