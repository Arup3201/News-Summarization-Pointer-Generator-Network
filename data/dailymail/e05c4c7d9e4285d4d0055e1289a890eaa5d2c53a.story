Captain calamity: Francesco Schettino pictured leaving court in Grosseto, Italy, last September. He recently gave a talk to students on 'panic control' 

Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino has sparked outrage by giving a lecture on 'panic control' while standing trial for wrecking the luxury liner he was commanding killing 32 people.

Schettino, 52, dubbed 'Captain Calamity' after he steered the Costa Concordia on to rocks, gave a two hour talk to students as part of their criminal science masters course.

He is facing charges of abandoning ship, causing a disaster and multiple manslaughter - with prosecutors claiming his poor handling of the disaster added to the tragedy.

It is claimed that Schettino had been invited to speak by Professor Vincenzo Mastronardi, who teaches at the La Sapienza University's Faculty of Medicine in Rome, Italy.

Prof Mastronardi denies inviting Schettino, claiming he simply turned up 'by surprise' ten minutes before the lecture was due to start. 

Schettino took to the microphone at an off campus event after a 3D reconstruction of the sinking of the Concordia off the island of Giglio in 2012 was shown to the students by engineer Ivan Paduano.

Schettino then told the audience at the Aviator Club in Rome that what had happened to him was 'only an accident' - failing to mention how he had told investigators he had 'tripped and stumbled into a lifeboat' the night of the disaster.

Prosecutors say he failed to notify authorities quickly enough of the seriousness of what had happened to the Concordia and that he had abandoned the ship when there were more than 300 passengers and crew still on board.

Witness have told his trial that in the minutes after the liner struck rock a 'panic stricken Schettino ran his fingers through his hair shouting Madonna what have I done' - only adding to questions over the suitability of him giving the lecture.

He spoke of his experiences as a cruise ship captain adding that he had been asked to give the talk as he was 'an expert'.

Schettino said: 'I had to illustrate how best to control panic management - or better still how a human being behaves in situations of that nature.

'I have voyaged across all the oceans of the world. I know how to react when these situations arise and how to react when you have an ethnically diverse crew. Every choice I made had fundamental human component.

'There are academic studies which compare what happened the disaster of the Costa Concordia to other similar tragedies. For example, the Twin Towers, how is that during that attack people threw themselves from windows but didn't do the same on the Concordia? I was actually given an academic award for my presentation.'

Lifeboats stream from the sinking Costa Concordia: Prosecutors say Schettino abandoned the ship in a panic when there were more than 300 passengers and crew still on board. The disaster killed 32 people

Human remains, thought to be those of the last missing victim of the Costa Concordia, have been found, a week after the vessel was towed to the scrapyard.

Twenty-one months after the cruise liner hit rocks and sank off the coast of Tuscany, bones thought to be those of heroic Indian waiter Russel Rebello were spotted by divers.

A specialised team of police frogmen began the search for Mr Rebello, who refused a place on a lifeboat to stay behind and help passengers, on Tuesday morning.

A skull and part of a hand have been found on the ship's fourth deck, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported.

Genoa Prosecutor Federico Manotti has ordered a DNA test on the remains to establish whether they are that of Rebello or those of an Italian woman who was the last victim to be recovered from the wreck in October 2013.

'Both the families of Russel Rebello and Maria Grazia Tricarichi have been informed because we can't rule out the possibility that the remains are hers,' the police said in a statement.

However today the news sparked outrage, with Italian media labelling it another 'shocking embarrassment' for the country - reminding people how Schettino had also been ordered to 'Get back on board for f***'s sake' by a furious coastguard official after he confessed he had left the Concordia.

La Sapineza's chancellor Luigi Frati said: 'We distance ourselves from this serious episode and condemn it profoundly. Professor Mastronardi has been referred to the university's Ethics Committee for a disciplinary investigation.'

Francesco Verusio, who is prosecuting Schettino, said: 'I am completely speechless at how some things are allowed to happen in this country. How on earth can someone invite Schettino to give a lecture at a university?

'How can a university professor, a man of culture and who is supposed to transmit to young people the principles of university education invite Schettino? What sort of image does that give our country?

'He gave a two hour lecture and then he was awarded a diploma. A diploma for what? I hope the students made fun of him.'

Professor Mastronardi said: 'It's right that I have been referred to a disciplinary hearing - I would have done the same in a similar situation, it gives me the opportunity to clarify matters in the appropriate venue.

'All I will say is that I did not invite Schettino, he just turned up ten minutes before the lecture started completely by surprise. He explained that if he had immediately lowered the anchors the ship would have sunk straight away.

'He told the audience that by handing the psychology of the situation he had to ensure not to cause alarm and create a panic.'
