These are the breath-taking panoramic shots taken by a paraglider soaring through the skies of Europe.

Veteran glider Tim Pentreath, 50, from Bath in Somerset, has spent more than 24 years travelling the world taking stunning bird’s eye shots of picturesque landscapes.

The photographer, who learnt to paraglide in 1990 in South Wales, has taken more than 2,000 images at 16 locations throughout Europe - and has even taken mid-flight ‘selfies’ by attaching his GoPro camera to an extended pole.

'There are so many aspects of paragliding you just wouldn’t get from any other sport,' said Pentreath.

'The freedom, the amazing views, flying in and out of clouds, the feeling of being pulled skywards at speeds of up to 10 m/s in a strong thermal, the sense of adventure and of course the friends I’ve made and the amazing places I’ve seen.

'I’m forever reminding myself what a huge privilege it is to be able to do this amazing sport.'

'A big adventure': Ager, in the region of Catalonia in Spain is a popular paragliding spot as well as making a stunning bird's eye view shot

Pentreath, who uses a Lumix T25 camera to capture the incredible wide angle shots, regularly takes part in paragliding competitions in rural locations across the world.

Having won his first title in the 90s in a small competition in Snowdonia, Wales, he recently beat more than 120 pilots to finish top in the Sports Class category at the British Open in Ager, Lleida, Spain.

But despite his success, he doesn’t let his love of competing override his profound love of the sport.

Another breathtaking shot from his favourite location of St Andre les Alpes. 'It's about sharing amazing experiences with great friends,' he says

'Of course I enjoy doing well and winning, but for me the competitions are more about sharing amazing experiences with great friends, than out and out competing. Even the smallest hill in Wiltshire can be a launch pad for a big adventure, that’s what really matters.

The area around Saint-Andre-les-Alpes in France is one of m the glider's favourite places to take to the air, he says.

'The combination of reliable weather, paragliding friendly infrastructure, stunning scenery and good food and wine are all conducive to an unforgettable flying experience. Having said that, on the right day, flying in the Scottish Highlands can be pretty unbeatable.'

The countries the veteran paraglider has flown over include England, Scotland, Wales, France: Morzine, Annecy, Chamonix, Saint-André-les-Alpes, Greoliers/Gourdon, Spain: Piedrahita, Pedro Bernardo, Valle de Abdalajís, Austria: Mayrhofen, Italy: Gemona del Fruili, Portugal: Manteigas, Switzerland: Grindlewald.
