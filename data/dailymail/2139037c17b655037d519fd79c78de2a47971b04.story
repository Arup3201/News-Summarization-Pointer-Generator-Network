A man who spent nearly 26 years on death row in Louisiana walked free of prison Tuesday, hours after a judge approved the state's motion to vacate the inmate's murder conviction in the 1983 killing of a jeweler.

Glenn Ford, 64, had been on death row since August 1988 in connection with the death of 56-year-old Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Ford had done occasional yard work. Ford had always denied killing Rozeman.

Ford walked out the maximum security prison at Angola this afternoon, said Pam Laborde, a spokeswoman for Louisiana's Department of Public Safety and Corrections.

Asked as he walked away from the prison gates about his release, Ford told WAFB-TV, 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.'

Ford told the broadcast outlet he does harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed.

'Yeah, cause, I've been locked up almot 30 years for something I didn't do,' the freed inmate said. 'I can't go back and do anything I should have been doing when I was 35, 38, 40 stuff like that.'

The newly liberated man also lamented that he was not there to help raise his sons, who are now grownups. 

State District Judge Ramona Emanuel on Monday took the step of voiding Ford's conviction and sentence based on new information that corroborated his claim that he was not present or involved in Rozeman's death, Ford's attorneys said.

Ford, an African-American, was tried and convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death.

'We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr. Ford free,' said a statement from Gary Clements and Aaron Novod, the attorneys for Ford from the Capital Post Conviction Project of Louisiana.

They said Ford's trial had been 
'profoundly compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the 
unconstitutional suppression of evidence, including information from an 
informant.'

They also 
cited what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time 
of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon.

The victim's family have been notified of Ford's release from death row in advance.

'We
 understand that and actually believe the DA is acting honorably,' the slain jeweler's nephew, Dr Phillip Rozeman, told Shreveport Times. 'This is positive 
reflection on the criminal justice system that does the right thing for 
people.

'We donâ€™t have any animosity for anyone. If someone else was involved or others were involved in his death there also will be justice for those people.'

The groundwork for Ford's release was laid last week when prosecutors in Caddo Parish began filing motions suggesting that another suspect had confessed to being the shooter.

According to court documents, confidential informant Jake Robinson had revealed that he was the one who pulled the trigger, killing Rozeman.

Robinson was one of four people initially charged in the killing. The other three were Ford, George Starks and the informant's brother, Henry Robinson.

Currently, there are 83 men and two women serving death sentences in Louisiana, according to Laborde.

A Louisiana law entitles those who have served time but are later exonerated to receive compensation.

It calls for payments of $25,000 per year of wrongful incarceration up to a maximum of $250,000, plus up to $80,000 for loss of 'life opportunities.'
