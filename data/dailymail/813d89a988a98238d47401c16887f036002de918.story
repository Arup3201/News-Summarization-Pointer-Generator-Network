Squeamish couples can finally take a bath together in separate vessels of water.

Those who want to spend quality time with their partner while bathing but would rather not risk brushing against them can relax in comfort, as long as they're happy to invest a cool £35,000 in the Yin Yang Bathtub.

The appliance is the invention of German firm Trautwein and they claim it could revolutionise bathroom habits.

Squeamish couples can finally take a bath together in separate vessels of water with the Yin Yang tub

The Yin Yang bathtub is ideal for couples who want to spend quality time together without encroaching on each others' personal space.

The unique design separates the tub in two equal halves - creating very distinct his and hers spaces, which are even illuminated in blue and pink light - in case of any confusion.

There's also soundwave massage technology which allows 
users to bathe directly in a loudspeaker, enjoying musical vibrations 
through their body, while a jacuzzi style option surges whirling air 
through the water, for a champagne effect, promoting 'relaxation and 
recovery'.

It works in spas for 'friends or mothers and daughters' to spend quality time while bathing

As well as couples who can't be apart but don't like to cuddle in the bath the makers say the tub can be shared between close friends, or even mother and daughter.

The form of the tub is reminiscent of the Chinese symbol Yin and Yang, which expresses the constant change of the opposites as each bather has their own bathing water, temperature and colour choice.

The groundbreaking tub will set bathers back a cool £35,000
