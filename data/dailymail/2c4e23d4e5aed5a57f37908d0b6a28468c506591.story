The dapper style of the roaring twenties has returned, with a little help from Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, and it seems men can be just as inspired as women.

Since Leonardo DiCaprio appeared in the character of Jay Gatsby showcasing an ultra-styled, slicked back hair style epitomising the polished 1920s style, one high-street pharmacy has seen sales of men’s hair pomade, wax and gel soar.

Sales of VO5 Extreme Style Grooming Hair Pomade have almost doubled, while Fudge Urban Matte Wax has seen sales rise 25 per cent when compared the same time in 2012 at Superdrug.

Sales of Just For Men hair colorant have also benefited from the Gatsby effect with sales rising by a third as men rush out to emulate the film's super dapper stars.

Celebrities have also fallen for Gatsby’s slicked back style with stars such as David Beckham and Daniel Radcliffe choosing groomed retro styles.

And it’s not just men who are inspired by Gatsby, sales of self-grip small and medium hair rollers are up 24 per cent at teh same retailers as women aim for the finger-curled glamour of Daisy Buchanan played by Carey Mulligan.

Sarah Sharp, Senior Buyer of Hair at the high-street store said: 'Our customers love to follow the latest trends and The Great Gatsby is proving to be a huge inspiration for both men and women.

'Today’s men are more confident than ever experimenting with different styles. 

'The Great Gatsby look follows last year’s Mad Men 1950s look, showing that for men retro hair remains firmly in fashion.'

High-street fashion has also been benefiting from the Great Gatsby effect with the likes of Debenhams seeing sales of vintage-inspired items soar by up to 266 per cent.

George at Asda has also reported sales of its
glamorous beaded collar blouse and vintage-style lace dress are up as 
shoppers are dazzled by the Gatsby film fashion.

Strings
of pearls, flower headbands and corsages are also proving popular to 
recreate the vintage inspired look, and in response George has stocked 
the shelves with plenty to cope with soaring demand.
