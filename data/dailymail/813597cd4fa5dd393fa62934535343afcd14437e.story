Gough Whitlam was Australia's 21st prime minister from 1972 to 1975 and his rein was as short as it was spectacular.

For a man whose first foray into politics actually ended in disappointment, failing to win a spot in local government soon after the end of World War II, his political life will remain forever entwined in Australia history.

While his dismissal as PM in 1975 by his former friend and colleague Sir John Kerr is seen as the defining moment, his whirlwind policy overhaul when in power is perhaps now, certainly more than at the time, more fondly remembered. The changes included establishing universal health care through Medibank (the forerunner of Medicare), ending the 'white Australia' policy and fee free university education.

Gough Whitlam was born on July 11, 1916. His father Fred became Commonwealth Crown Solicitor and the classically educated young Gough grew up in Canberra, before studying at Sydney University.

He married Margaret Dovey in 1942 whom he constantly referred to as 'the love of my life' and they had three sons and a daughter.

Whitlam joined the World War II RAAF, becoming a flight lieutenant and bomber navigator.

When the war ended Mr Whitlam had linked with the Labor Party and went on to complete a law degree.

'It's Time' was the catchy slogan which took hold around the country in 1972 as Gough Whitlam campaigned with celebrities like singer Little Pattie

His political breakthrough would arrive in 1951, when Whitlam won pre-selection for the south-west Sydney seat of Werriwa and he quickly rose to prominence in political ranks with a combination of quick wit and radical policies.

As deputy and then-leader of the Labor opposition, Whitlam sought to reform Labor Party structures, particularly national and Victorian.

He created a shadow ministry and developed a comprehensive set of policies, known as 'the program'. He soon established parliamentary dominance over Prime Minister Billy McMahon after assuming the leadership of the ALP in 1969. But the internal split in ranks (prior to his taking over as leader) which led to the Democratic Labor Party going it alone, would ultimately contribute to his undoing as PM.

However, on the back of a very presidential American-style 'It's Time' slogan (which also took its lead from a previous Menzies campaign) he won office on December 2, 1972, ending the Labor Party's 23 years in the wilderness.

Whitlam had flagged his foreign policies well before the election, when in 1971 he travelled to China to meet with state officials. He would also consistently oppose Australia's intervention in East Timor.

Once ensconced as PM, the reforms rolled out quickly and spending rose considerably.

Indeed, in a frenetic 13 days before a full ministry could even be elected, the so-called 'duumvirate' consisting of just Whitlam and deputy Lance Barnard went to work covering almost 30 portfolios.

They would go on to take a staggering 50 plus decisions, which did not require legislation.

The Whitlam government overhaul was quickly taking shape. Social and political reforms went into over-drive as they arranged for the release of all Vietnam war draft dodgers and an end to Australia's involvement there with the troops brought back home. There was also an end to conscription.

The Family Court of Australia system was set in place and government officials also went as far as organising for the release of uncensored the film 'Portnoy's Complaint' and removing sales tax on contraceptives.

Among the social reform changes, there was also the abolition of the death penalty. 

In the middle of all that, the controversial age of 'white Australia' was brought to a close, as he abolished that controversial long-standing policy. But it was the big-ticket item which polarised opinions.

Whitlam's government would ignite universal health care through Medibank (today's Medicare system), fee-free university education and put in place social welfare reform. 

What rankled with many was that while they lacked control of the Senate, Whitlam's government still managed to abolish fees for tertiary education, reform family law, brought the Commonwealth into urban and regional development and took sewerage systems to many Sydney and Melbourne suburbs.

Spending on Aboriginal affairs (including the returning of traditional land to Australia's indigenous community) and the arts increased significantly.

The Whitlam government also extended the adult minimum wage to include women workers for the first time, brought in the concept of no-fault divorce and provided the foundation for the Family Court of Australia.

Spending continued at very high levels, however, and inflation kept rising. But after an historic joint sitting following the 1974 double dissolution election, Medibank (the precursor of Medicare) was finally set up.

However, it started to go wrong from Christmas 1974 when Whitlam was accused of showing too little concern for the victims of Cyclone Tracy. He fell out with several ministers and forced the Speaker to resign. The Junie Morosi affair embroiled Treasurer Jim Cairns and a loans affair forced the resignation of Minerals and Energy Minister Rex Connor. 

The government's Senate numbers were weakened when a Labor senator died and Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen broke convention by nominating an anti-Labor replacement.

The economy started to slow dramatically and using control of the Senate, Malcolm Fraser's Coalition opposition blocked supply, effecting stopping the government from being able to pay the bills.

And then on November 11, 1975 came the moment which locked Gough Whitlam forever in Australian political history. Governor-General Sir John Kerr resolved the stalemate caused by the Senate's refusal to pass the budget by dismissing the Whitlam government (the first time in the history of Australia's federal parliament) and appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister. 

Whitlam had long considered Kerr a friend and he was, in fact, a Whitlam appointee. He had disregarded the PM's advice not to seek advice from the High Court and had given him no idea that he might be dismissed. On the other hand, many critics suggest Whitlam had both misread and mismanaged Kerr.

Margaret Whitlam in later years revealed that her husband admitted he 'should have torn up the (dismissal) letter'.

In the election following the dismissal, Labor suffered an unprecedented 30-seat loss and Fraser was confirmed as prime minister. Whitlam stayed on as Labor leader until 1977, when he suffered another heavy defeat. He stepped down and was replaced by Bill Hayden.

Gough Whitlam, a devoted republican, would go on to receive the order of Australia in 1978 and was later made Australia's Ambassador to UNESCO in Paris. He was chairman of the Australia-China Council for five years and both he and wife Margaret would be made life members of the ALP.

Margaret Whitlam passed away in March 2012, Gough Whitlam called her 'the love of my life'.
