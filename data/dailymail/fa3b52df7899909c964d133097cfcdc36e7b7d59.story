His partying ways may have come under fire and it seems he's lost the love of his life in Selena Gomez but it doesn't look like Justin Bieber's army of 'Beliebers' will be deserting him any time soon.

The teen heartthrob saw his last fragrance, The Key, become the best-selling celebrity scent of the year and now he's released a collector's edition in honour of his legion of fans.

The 20-year-old's latest perfume, Justin Bieber Collector’s Edition, aims to celebrate the powerful relationship between Justin and his fans who have been his biggest inspiration since day one, he says.

The teen singer, who looks fresh-faced and innocent in the new campaign imagery, has even inscribed a personal message to his fans, which reads 'you’re all that matters to me' on a collectable, removable keepsake charm, which hangs from the bottle.

The fragrance, which is full fruity and musky notes and launches on Wednesday, aims to captivate and inspire.

'The heart
 uncovers a blooming floral bouquet while the creamy and addictive dry 
down of sensual musks and warm amber leaves you forever thinking of 
Justin,' reads the description.
