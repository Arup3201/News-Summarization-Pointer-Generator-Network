Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth tells WFIE-TV that authorities found the cage where they believe Joelle Lockwood may have been kept. The mother of two had been missing since July 9. Oeth says Lockwood was taken to a hospital briefly Saturday night and then returned to her family

An Indiana woman missing for two months and apparently held as a slave in a cage has been found alive, and authorities have arrested a couple in connection with her July disappearance, police said on Sunday.

Joelle Lockwood, 30, went missing on July 9 and was allegedly kept inside the trailer of 37-year-old Ricky Roy House Jr. and 44-year-old Kendra Tooley where she was made to perform chores while wearing a belt like a dog collar around her neck, naked from the waist down.

They have been arrested on preliminary charges of criminal confinement and rape. 

The mother-of-two was freed after Tooley's ex-husband visited the suspects and rescued her while the couple aimed guns at him.

He brought her to Evansville Police Department, where detectives interviewed her and then went to the residence and arrested the suspects, police said.

Lockwood was allegedly abducted by House after he offered her a ride after a party. Sheriff Oeth said that the two had gone to high school together.

At House's suggestion Lockwood agreed to go back to his trailer.

'Once they arrived there, he forced her to stay and confined her,' Oeth said. 'As the investigation is progressing, this looks like there's more of a sexual motive.' 

According to police Tooley has admitted to police that Lockwood was abducted and held, but House has so far refused to cooperate with authorities.

According to WFIE, Tooley's ex, Ron Higgs, saved Lockwood after he realized she was being held prisoner.

'He took it upon himself to get her out of the residence and took her back to Evansville,' said Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth.

'Once there, he contacted authorities there. She's going to be returned to her family so we're very, very happy of the outcome from those circumstances.'

Higgs said that he was telephoned by Tooley on Thursday because she needed money from him.

Joelle Lockwood, 30, went missing on July 9 and was kept inside the trailer of 44-year-old Kendra Tooley and 37-year-old Ricky Roy House Jr.

He said that when he arrived at the couple's trailer, House brazenly showed him Lockwood inside the cage.

'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' said Higgs to WFIE.

'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.'

Higg said that she was being made to cook and clean by House and Tooley and he initially thought she had agreed to the bizarre set-up.

However, on Friday, which was his second night in the trailer, Lockwood approached him and begged for help.

'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, 'please, do not leave here with out me,' said Higgs.

'And I promised her, if I have to give my life to get you out of here I will.'

He then managed to get Lockwood out of the trailer, allegedly with guns trained on him, although Higgs has not clarified how he got the mother of two out as of Sunday.

'Everybody's calling me a hero,' said Higgs. 'I'm just a pure bred American, that I believe.'

Joelle's mother, Candace said on Sunday that she is thrilled and exhausted to have her daugher home, while family friend, Amanda Crowe said that the family is still in shock.

'I just really want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and has supported Joelle's family,' said Crowe.

'It means the world to all of us that the community has come out and has helped to find her.'

The official Facebook page for Lockwood to raise awareness of her disappearance was ecstatic at the news she had been found. 

'Thank you everyone for all their efforts with helping find Joelle!!!,' a Facebook post on a support page that offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to her recovery read on Saturday. 'JOELLE IS FOUND!!! SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL.' 

Lockwood was last seen on July 9 leaving a party in Evansville, about 20 miles away. She was walking in the area of Park Street and Florida Street in Evansville and allegedly intoxicated.

Authorities have also been exploring any possible connection between the Lockwood case and the August 15 disappearance of Kristy Kelley, 27, in Boonville, about 20 miles from Evansville, the Evansville Courier & Press reported last month.

Evansville police did not mention the Kelley case in their statement and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment on Sunday. 

A dispatcher for the Warrick County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday that Kelley was still missing.
