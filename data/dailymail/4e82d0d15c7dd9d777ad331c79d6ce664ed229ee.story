Two never-seen-before photos of Kate Moss taken during her first modelling-shoot have emerged after 25 years.

The first roll of film used for the session was recently unearthed in a desk drawer by the fashion photographer involved and he decided to make prints from it.

David Ross used three films during the shoot, with the first being a warm-up roll of pictures he took to help the 14-year-old aspiring model to relax.

The images of Kate were later given to renowned model agency Storm and used to help launch her career were taken from the next two films.

The first roll of film from Kate Moss's first ever photo shoot has just been rediscovered after 25 years

David, 48, first auctioned three photographs of the model's first 
sitting in November last year and raised Â£5,700 at Bloomsbury Auctions in London.

He has now had tow more prints run off from the negatives of the film to auction which also show Kate wearing a black silk shirt that David had given her to wear and are 'raw' portrait pictures of her looking at the camera.

The images David gave to Storm were more 'commercial' snaps and show Kate wearing a Fred Perry sweatshirt.

A few days earlier Kate had famously been discovered by a talent scout when she was waiting to board a flight to London from New York in 1988.

David, from St John's Wood, north London, was hired to do her first photo shoot on October 26, 1988.

The pictured reveal the stunning looks that launched Kate's career as one of the worlds top models

David found the negatives and original contact sheet and decided to get some of the images printed

He said: 'I remember Sarah Doukas at Storm telling me she had seen this girl and she was sending her to me.

'Kate turned up by herself during the 
school half-term holiday. I thought she had the wrong address first 
because she seemed quite young a lost.

'She wasn't forward or confident at all.

'I wasn't allowed to take any pictures of her because she was by herself so I told her to come back with somebody else and she did the next day.

'I took three rolls of films. The first roll was just to see how Kate responded to the camera and she was a natural.

David Ross shot a first roll as a warm-up

'These two pictures are from that roll and they have never been seen by anybody before.

'I didn't think there was any commercial potential in them because she looked so raw in them.

'The other pictures looked far more commercial and they helped launch her career.

'I enjoyed photographing her because she had quite angular bones. She looked so young. But these pictures portray her at the absolute threshold of her life changing forever.

'The negatives have been kept in my desk drawer pretty much since then. I am a bit of a hoarder and keep most things.

'My wife had been telling me for a while to have a clear out and I found the negatives and original contact sheet and decided to get some of the images printed.

'The two photos are from the original negatives from her very first photo shoot - the first time she had stood in front of a camera.'

The two black and white photos are on silver gelatin prints and measure 19ins by 13ins.

They are being sold by London auctioneers Bloomsbury for a pre-sale estimate of Â£1,200 each.

The auction takes place on May 17.
