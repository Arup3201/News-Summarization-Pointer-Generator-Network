Braving sub-zero conditions and eerie light, two scuba divers explore a mysterious but extraordinary underwater world beneath layers of ice.

These fascinating pictures taken by photographer Franco Banfi reveal what lies beneath the iced surface of the White Sea on Russia's north-west coast.

Temperatures in these waters can be as low as -2C, but that didn't faze Mr Banfi, who went underwater to shoot his scuba diving colleague Alexander.

Green: They dived 32ft and witnessed the amazing colours beneath the ice, which are created from humus - a major component in the organic matter of soil

Extraordinary: The huge boulder-like blocks of ice that were photographed are the result of divers smashing the ice's surface so they can enter the sea

Method: Mr Banfi said that ice holes have to be cut into the surface 'but, due to the low temperatures, they must be dug again before every dive'

While the diver and Mr Banfi were underwater they were attached by a rope to another colleague who waited on land, ready to assist if needed.

Mr Banfi, 54, who lives in southern Switzerland, said: ‘Reaching the underwater side is an experience itself.

‘The ice holes, also known as mainas, are the portals between the white frozen land and the mysterious, dark marine environment.

‘With the right equipment it was OK in the freezing water, but after about 30 minutes I started to feel the cold in my hands.

‘The colour underwater depends on the amount of humus in the water. Walking underwater is an exercise of buoyancy.

‘For safety reasons, a rope connects each diver with someone who stays by the mouth of the hole, withstanding the adverse weather conditions.’

Mr Banfi, who is also a travel guide, added: ‘I've been to the White Sea many times, but every time I go back it provides a new and incredible experience.'
