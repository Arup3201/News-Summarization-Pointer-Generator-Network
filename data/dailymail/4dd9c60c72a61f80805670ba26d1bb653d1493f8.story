Bernie Goetz, the 'subway vigilante' who shot four panhandling youths on a New York City train in 1984 is fighting low-level drug charges.

Goetz was arrested in November on misdemeanor drug charges after police say he was nabbed in a sting selling $30 worth of pot to an undercover officer in Union Square Park, Manhattan.

Manhattan prosecutors offered him 10 days of community service on Wednesday to resolve the case - which Goetz turned down.

The 65-year-old admitted on Wednesday outside court that he had the drugs but he says he is fighting the charges because he was coerced into taking money for the pot and because police are too aggressive.

He asked the woman if she wanted to get high, then went back to his apartment, where he has lived for decades, and returned with marijuana, authorities said. He was arrested on charges of criminal sale of marijuana.

In 1987, Goetz was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of weapons charges after the 1984 shooting of four black youths and spent 250 days in jail. He says the young men had sharpened screwdrivers and were trying to mug him.

Goetz's actions prompted a debate over race relations and frustration with high crime rates of New York in the 1980s.

With
 New York in the grip of a violent crime epidemic, some hailed Goetz for
 standing up to his potential attackers. Others saw him as a racist, who
 had overstepped the boundaries of self-defense.

Goetz ended up serving eight months in jail, but his legacy lasted much longer than his time in the big house.

He went on to become an activist for a tougher focus on crime, and he proceeded to run for mayor of the city in 2001 and the city's public advocate in 2005.

Neither bid was successful, but Goetz traded in on his given nickname by opening an repair store called Vigilante Electronics.

His case came back up in the press in December 2011 when one of the four men he shot killed himself in an apparent suicidal drug overdose on the 27th anniversary of the attack.

James Ramseur was found dead in the Paradise Motor Inn in the Bronx. Ramseur was the youngest of four teens who surrounded Goetz on the 2 train on December 22, 1984.

Believing the group was about to rob him, Goetz pulled out a .38 calibre revolver and fired, striking each of them once.

Ramseur was shot in the chest, but survived. The other teenagers - Barry Allen, Troy Canty and Darrell Cabey - were also hospitalized and were not killed.

Cabey was left paralyzed by the bullet that struck him.
