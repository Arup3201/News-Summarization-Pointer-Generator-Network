Attacks: Fighter Azran Quasid, 26, attacked the women on different occasions after befriending them, Guildford Crown Court was told

A cage fighting friend of Alex Reid whose ring-name is 'Casanova' overpowered and raped two women in violent attacks, it was 
alleged today.

Fighter Azran Quasid, 26, attacked the women on different occasions after befriending them, Guildford Crown Court was told.

The second rape is said to have been carried out while Quasid was on bail after being accused of the first.

Toyin Salako, prosecuting, said: 'Both women are strangers to each other. Neither of them had ever met the other.

'On each occasion, he refused to take ‘no’ for an answer.'

The jury was told that both crimes were committed in the defendant’s home in Camberley, Surrey.

The
first alleged attack was on an 18-year-old girl in June last year, 
while the second was in April of this year, the jury heard.

Ms Salako said the first woman fell victim to Quasid after they met on Facebook.

The complainant told police she had gone to the defendant’s house but had made it plain that she was not prepared to have sex.

The victim told police this did not stop Quasid from 'trying it on' while the pair were in his bedroom watching DVDs.

The woman, whose police interview, was played to jurors, said she told Quasid: 'Slow down. I don’t know you.'

She added she had even devised a strategy before arriving to Quasid's house in the even he attempted to have sex with her.

Fighter: Quasid, 26, right, who is almost six foot tall, spars with Kester Adaba, left, during their fight last year

Ongoing: Quasid denies two counts of rape and one of assault by penetration

She had planned to pretend that her mother had texted her mobile phone to say her father was ill.

But the yarn did not seem to deter the defendant who became more and more insistent, she added.

The victim said she was eventually overpowered by Quasid, who is nearly six feet tall.

Fighting friends: The court was told the defendant was a cage fighter and knew Katie Price's ex husband, Alex Reid

Namesake: Quasid's ring-name is 'Casanova' after Giacomo Casanova, the 18th-century Italian adventurer and notorious womaniser

She said: 'He was so much stronger than me,' before adding that Quasid had penetrated her anally with his fingers and forced her to have intercourse with him.

The complainant said she was afraid to resist too strongly. 'I didn’t want to make him angry,' she said.

The woman then left the house before telling a friend what had happened. Ten months later, the defendant befriended another woman, the jury heard.

Ms Salako said Quasid pestered the second woman for sex despite her telling him 'no'.

'He wasn’t going to take no for an answer,' Ms Salako added. The court heard that Quasid then raped the complainant anally.

Jurors heard that when he was arrested, Quasid told police that no sexual contact had taken place without the full consent of both women.

The court was told the defendant was a cage fighter and knew Katie Price's ex husband, Alex Reid.

The trial continues.
