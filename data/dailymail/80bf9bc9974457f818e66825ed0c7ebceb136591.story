Burnley striker Danny Ings is ready to see out his contract and leave Turf Moor in the summer.

The 22-year-old, who returned to the starting line-up against West Ham on Saturday after missing three games with a hamstring strain, has been offered new terms by Burnley.

Yet with the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa and Stoke all keen, Ings will weigh up his options at the end of the season.

Burnley bought Ings for £1m from Bournemouth and now value him at around £10m but will be left asking for compensation in the summer as Ings is under 23.

Any English club will likely have to pay around £3m but he could move abroad for just £300,000.

Burnley, meanwhile, have been checking on Ilkeston midfielder Che Adams. The Premier League side sent a senior scout to watch the 18-year-old against Halesowen on Monday. Southampton have also watched him.
