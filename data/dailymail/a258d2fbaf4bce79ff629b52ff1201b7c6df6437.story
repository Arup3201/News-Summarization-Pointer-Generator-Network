It's time to dump those dumbbells boys as a new survey has revealed that having a muscular physique will get you nowhere when it comes to dating apps.

A study has revealed that women who use Tinder are more likely to swipe right to metrosexual men than beefed up bodies.

The results also found that women are likely to shun other stereotypes such as a hipster, rocker or 'lad' in favour of a vainer man.

Well presented: The metrosexual man profile received the most matches out of the four stereotypes

The discovery comes as a result of an experiment conducted by party planner firm Hen Heaven to try to decipher what kind of men make desirable matches.

Four male profiles were created for each stereotype, gym buff, rocker, lad and metrosexual using the same model. 

Each profile ran from the same location in Brighton, East Sussex, for a fortnight with the Tinder age range set as 18-35 and the distance was set to 18km (11.1 miles) for each of the five profiles.

Not so hot: The gym buff ranked worst out of the group with just 42 matches

Over the course of the two weeks that the profiles were live, the names, ages and messages from each woman that matched with the men were documented. 

The mature metrosexual account received 241 matches (39.4 per cent). The average age of the potential partners was 23-and-a-half years old.

Meanwhile women are the least keen on the gym buff type, whose profile only received 42 matches (6.8 per cent).

The research revealed that women are more likely to swipe right to a man who is well groomed 

The typical Jack-the-lad still remains a popular choice for the ladies, with 124 women expressing their desire to meet up with the model in the lad account.

The cool, smoking hipster received 105 matches while the fashionable rocker attracted 99 matches on the dating app.

Relationship expert Caroline Brealey says that the appeal of the metrosexual is simply down to good old-fashioned aesthetics.  

'Metrosexuals are easily spotted in a crowd because they look good. They probably have enough products in their bathroom to rival Boots and it definitely shows, because this man likes to look his best at all times.'

Caroline added that although women are initially attracted to well-groomed types they can prove problematic when it comes to actual relationships. 

'The obvious down sides can be vanity and fights over bathroom time (and products).'

However she also pointed out that if his approach to relationships is similar to his dedication to his appearance, he could make a promising partner.

'If his attention to detail flows over into other areas of his life, he'll be an attentive boyfriend who cares about the little things, from taking your coat to buying you thoughtful gifts.

'If you also take pride in your appearance and value setting off to the more prestigious places to eat, drink and spend your holidays, you'll be a perfect fit.'

Caroline says that when it comes to impressing the well-turned-out man they look for a similar level of upkeep with their women. 

'Generally speaking, metrosexual men are drawn to women that let their femininity out and are essentially the glam version of the girl next door.'

Popular choice: The typical jack the lad image came in second with 141 women expressing interest

Caroline added that daters are probably making the right choice if they have a penchant for pristine men as gym bunnies tend to put their women second.

'If you're not happy catering to the gym buff's meal plans and coming second to the weights, treadmills and cross trainers, he's probably not for you.

'Gym buffs are most definitely suited to girls who like to keep fit, as they will be able to co-ordinate schedules and push each other to do their best and stay in shape.

'Having to fit his gym sessions into daily life might be a chore at times.'

When it comes to the 'lad', Caroline says that there family values and sociable nature can make them a suitable mate. 

'Extremely friend and family orientated, with the right girl, the "lad" can be the right guy.

'His friends will be at his core - from trips to see his football team play to Saturday nights largely being reserved for the weekly "big night out" - meaning he will of course suit a lady with a similar lifestyle, who isn't waiting at home for a text and fretting over what he's up to.

'It isn't all glugging beers and chanting at the football, though, because he'll probably be very close to his family behind all the bravado.'
