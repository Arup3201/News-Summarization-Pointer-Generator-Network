The US State Department has accused ISIS of taking screen grabs of Hungarian pornography and claiming the images show the rape of Arab women by western soldiers. 

The original image was tweeted from an account claiming allegiance with the terrorist group. 

The tweet features three images, one of a distressed, small child. The second features a woman being held by men in military fatigues and the final image shows a man in Arab dress being abused by a soldier. 

The ISIS tweet had a very graphic image which it claimed showed the abuse of a woman in Syria  

The US State Department countered the tweet claiming the image came from a Hungarian porn movie 

ISIS uses social media heavily in a bid to recruit new recruits from Europe and north America

In the tweet, ISIS claims that they are the 'sole saviour of millions of Sunni Muslims against Iraqi-Syria army butchers'. 

In response to the ISIS tweet, the US State Department using their Think Again Turn Away social media account, said the middle rape image was taken from Hungarian porn. 

The tweet claims that ISIS should 'stop using fake photos to trick people' into supporting their 'lost cause'. 

According to the State Department, the role of their anti-terrorist social media accounts is to 'expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda.' 

The Think Again Turn Away account as more than 13,000 followers and has made almost 3,000 tweets. 

It has also released some graphic videos to counter the recruitment videos produced on behalf of ISIS to encourage western Muslims to travel to Iraq and Syria. 

In one video, the US State Department claims that ISIS terrorists crucify fellow Muslims, attack mosques with suicide bombs and that travel is cheap as a would-be ISIS terrorist only requires a one-way ticket.

The US State Department has claimed that almost 1,500 Syrian civilians have been executed by ISIS over the past five months since they had declared their caliphate.
