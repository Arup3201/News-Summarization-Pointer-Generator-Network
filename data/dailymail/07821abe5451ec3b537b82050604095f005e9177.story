Mark Ramprakash is to be unveiled as England's new batting coach following the controversial sacking of Graham Gooch earlier this year.

The 45-year-old Ramprakash, who earned a reputation during his playing days as a technically impressive batsman who all too rarely fulfilled his potential, will assume his new role in time for England's one-day tour of Sri Lanka later this month. 

He has been appointed until September 2015.

He made a positive impression with the England batsmen after being invited to help out in the dressing-room at the start of the 2014 international summer. Having formed a close working relationship with captain Alastair Cook, he will help out in every format.

Ramprakash retired in 2012, aged 42, with 114 first class centuries to his name but a Test average of 27

Ramprakash, who retired in 2012 at the age of 42 with 114 first-class centuries to his name, has said: 'Cook coped magnificently given the tidal wave of criticism. You did wonder if there was an agenda against him.'

Now he will be given the chance to cement his popularity within the Peter Moores set-up as England embark on a diet of one-day cricket ahead of the World Cup, which starts in New Zealand on Valentine's Day.

Sportsmail understands Ramprakash will not be involved on a full-time basis, as England seek to respond to criticism about their bloated back-room staff. But he will be used at some point in every series.

Many had tipped Ramprakash's friend and former team-mate Graham Thorpe to replace Gooch in the role, but Thorpe's reluctance to re-embark on touring life pushed England in Ramprakash's direction.

His 11-year international career, which brought him 52 Test caps but only two centuries and an average of 27, often felt symptomatic of an era in which England invariably fell short of expectations.

Critics will point out that he managed only a single half-century in 18 one-day internationals – the format that will dominate England's schedule until the Test tour of the Caribbean in April.

Ramprakash was technically gifted and brilliant at County level but never quite realised his potential for England

But there is no doubting his long-form credentials and, following his last Test in 2002, Ramprakash played on for another decade at domestic level, establishing himself as the pre-eminent run-maker on the county circuit and rising to national stardom in 2006-07 by winning the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing competition.

The occasionally tempestuous youngster who earned himself the nickname 'Bloodaxe' gradually learned to accept his fate. England are now hoping to put his accumulated wisdom to good use. 

The former cricketer excelled off the field with victory in the 2006/07 series of Strictly Come Dancing
