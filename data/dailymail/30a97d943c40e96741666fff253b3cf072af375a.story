A mother had to face every parent's worst nightmare after her daughter fell from a high diving board and it was feared she could be brain damaged or paralysed.

Eight-year-old Abby was taken to the A&E department at London's King's College Hospital following her three metre fall onto concrete.

Abby loved swimming and diving at her local leisure centre and had slipped and banged her head as she climbed the steps to the five metre diving board.

Vigil: Worried mother Nikki reassures her daughter Abby in A&E following her fall from a diving board

Her story is revealed in tonight's episode of Channel 4 reality show 24 Hours in A&E and shows her mother Nikki's ordeal as she faces her daughter's injuries and tries to stay brave for her little girl.

Leader of the trauma team Tushar, a paediatric intensive care consultant, has to tell Nikki to expect the worst when Abby is first taken in by the paramedics because he said he will not 'give false hope.'

He said: 'Seeing her (Abby) getting drowsy was not good, her brain could be under pressure from a blood clot.'

Terrifying: Nikki said it was awful facing the prospect her daughter could be brain damaged or paralysed

Tushar explains to Nikki that her daughter will need a CT scan to find out if there is a bleed on her brain.

'I noticed the sheer look of panic and that bottled-up emotion that every mother has when they're scared,' he recalled of Nikki's reaction.

Nikki from South London admitted it was 'frightening' seeing her daughter with so many doctors around her and getting injections but was relieved when the CT scan showed no bleeding on Abby's brain.

However, she was then warned there was a possibility Abby's spine had been damaged by her fall.

Nikki said: 'You feel helpless. To actually face that your child could be paralysed, it's just the worst feeling ever.'

But Nikki had to bottle up her own fears as she sought to reassure her scared daughter.

She said: 'For someone who was so bubbly, it's sad to see her little broken body and her broken spirit, but I
still had to say to her, 'you're going to be fine, 
you're doing really well,' just to get
through it.'

Helpless: Abby's father, Scott, was stuck in Scotland as the drama unfolded

Meanwhile, Abby's father, Scott, was stranded in Scotland after missing the last train home after working in Edinburgh for the day.

He said he was in agony at not being able to be at his daughter's bedside and support his wife during their time of need.

'I just wanted to comfort Abby or just 
comfort Nikki,' he said. 'Suddenly you just realise that your family, that you've created, it's bigger than anything really. And you just 
feel as though you want to make everything better or just to 
look after them, protect them.'

The family were relieved when Abby's X-ray revealed no injury to her spine, but she had fractured her eye socket and had to be kept in over-night so doctors could continue to monitor her.

Despite the horrific circumstances, Nikki said it was 'quite a special time, that night, because you're just open and vulnerable and fragile.'

'For me 
having that connection that night as a mother to a daughter, I 
think it will always remain with me,' she said.

Recovered: Abby fractured her eye socket but hasn't lost her love of diving

After Abby was allowed to go home, her parents recalled how it took her a little while to get back to her old self.

'After the accident there was a period when we didn't have our little girl, we had some girl
who was quite morbid,' Scott said.

Nikki added that for a week after, she and Scott 'would just burst out crying for no reason' because of all the 'pent-up emotion.'

But now she's recovered, Abby said her ordeal hasn't put her off diving.

'I would like to go high but I thought just leave it for a few weeks and then start doing the five metre again,' she said.
