Hillary Clinton hinted at a 2016 presidential run during a star-studded gala on Tuesday, asking an enthusiastic audience of female Democrats: 'Don't you someday want to see a woman president?'

However, the former US first lady shunned questions about her 'extensive' use of a personal email address during her four-year tenure as Secretary of State from January 2009 to February 2013.

She also avoided claims that she violated the US Federal Records Act by failing to preserve her correspondence via hdr22@clintonemail.com on State Department servers until two months ago.

Instead, Mrs Clinton teased the audience about her political future during the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY's List, an organization that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.

Speaking on the cusp of a second presidential campaign, the 67-year-old, who is married to former president Bill Clinton, noted that during one's life, 'you get a chance to make millions of decisions'.

'Some of them are big, like `Do you run for office?',' she told attendees, including Orange Is The New Black actress Uzo Aduba, Ugly Betty star America Ferrera and acclaimed chef Padma Lakshmi

Addressing the female Democrats, Mrs Clinton asked if they were hopeful of seeing more females running for local offices such as school board member, governor, mayor and member of Congress.

'I suppose it's only fair to say, `Don't you someday want to see a woman president?'', the supposed front-runner for next year's Democratic presidential nomination asked, causing the crowd to erupt.

Mrs Clinton also previewed several economic themes that could animate an upcoming race, pointing to an economy that too often fails to address the challenges faced by families and working mothers. 

'We have to get our economy to reflect the realities of 21st century America, and we're not doing that,' she told listeners, also including actress Anna Gun, who plays Skyler White in Breaking Bad.

Taking to the stage: Mrs Clinton also avoided claims that she violated the US Federal Records Act by failing to preserve her correspondence via hdr22@clintonemail.com on State Department servers until two months ago

'We're not doing that when the hard work of men and women across our country is not rewarded with rising wages, but CEO pay goes up and up no matter what.' 

Mrs Clinton's avoidance of questions about her sole use of a personal email account instead of a government-issued address during her time as secretary of state drew criticism Tuesday evening.

The New York Times article which revealed her sole use of a personal address also described how Mrs Clinton's aides decided which personal emails to eventually disclose to the State Department.

They ultimately chose to release 55,000 pages of correspondence - out of an unspecified number - as Mrs Clinton stepped down from the role in 2013, according to the widely-read article.

Republicans seized on the disclosures, accusing Mrs Clinton of violating a law intended to archive official government documents. 

GOP officials have also amplified reports that the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments ahead of an expected Clinton campaign.

'It speaks volumes that Hillary Clinton will gladly attend fancy galas yet continue to hide from the American people,' said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore on Tuesday.

She said voters deserved to know 'why she only used private email while serving as secretary of state at the same time the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from foreign governments who were lobbying her State Department.'

Another speaker: The event brought to the stage Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the group's first endorsed candidate who recently announced her retirement, and Sen. Al Franken (pictured speaking to the audience)

Applause: Mrs Clinton's (pictured)avoidance of questions about her sole use of a personal email account instead of a government-issued address during her time as secretary of state drew criticism on Tuesday 

In her speech, Mrs Clinton accused Republicans of fostering policies promoting 'trickle-down economics' but noted both parties have spoken of ways to boost wages for middle-class workers. 

'We welcome them to come with their ideas and we will match them,' she said of the Republicans, adding: 'That's what elections should be about. Elections should be a contest of ideas.'

The prospect of a Clinton campaign was invoked repeatedly by political leaders who have worked with the fundraising powerhouse, whose name is an acronym for 'Early money is like yeast.' 

The organization has a strong track record in Democratic politics, electing more than 100 women to the U.S. House, 19 to the Senate, 10 governors and more than 500 state and local officials.

'She's more than an idol,' said Stephanie Schriock, EMILY's List's president, describing Clinton. 'She's an inspiration - and a leader whose talents we desperately need.'

The event brought to the stage Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, the group's first endorsed candidate who recently announced her retirement, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a deadly 2011 shooting during a political event at a Tucson, Arizona, shopping mall, also addressed the audience.

Ms Giffords said female leaders deliver results, in places like city hall, state houses, governor's mansions and Congress, 'and maybe soon, in the White House.'

Ms Aduba, Ms Gunn and Ms Lakshmi also took to the stage during Tuesday's gala. 

Friends: Ms Gunn and Ms Lakshmi pose together ahead of the anniversary  gala for EMILY's List, a group which was founded by Ellen Malcolm in 1985 and works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights

EMILY's LIst has helped lay the groundwork for a potential Clinton campaign, holding events to promote the possibility of electing the nation's first female president and commissioning polling.

Ellen Malcolm, the founder of the organization, pointed to Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as the first step, bringing the audience to their feet when she identified 2016 as the 'time to shatter that glass ceiling and put a woman in the White House.'

Mrs Clinton, seated in the audience, laughed and clapped along with the crowd. 'Hillary, you heard us,' Ms Malcolm said. 'Just give us the word and we'll be right at your side.'

Mrs Clinton accepted the  group's 'We are Emily' award during the Washington DC-based event.
