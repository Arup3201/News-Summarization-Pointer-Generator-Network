While some buskers merit a few coins, footage has emerged of a group of drummers who deserve their own TV show.

The clip shows an incredible display of synchronised skill outside the TCF Bank Stadium in Minneapolis following a Minnesota Vikings game against the New York Jets on Sunday.

What’s more, the men manage to wow passers-by  with their dexterity despite the fact that they’re only playing on buckets.

Drumming up support: The men manage to wow the crowds with their dexterity despite the fact that they’re only playing on buckets

Those watching whoop and cheer as the men play with extraordinary precision in snowy conditions, even flipping their drumsticks around in time with each other.

It’s not clear how much money they made from their percussive endeavours, but they’re raking in views on the internet, with over 11,000 hits so far.

And they probably cheered up a few Jets fans, as their team lost 24-30 to the Vikings.

The clip comes hot on the tail of a little girl becoming an internet sensation after she danced to music by subway buskers and started a hoedown in the process.

The band Coyote, which was playing a Grateful Dead Cover of 'Me & My Uncle,' posted the video of the New York moment on YouTube and the video now has over 200,000 views. 

The little girl who started it all can be seen dressed all in pink and grooving out to the band's tune. A green haired woman dances along with her.
