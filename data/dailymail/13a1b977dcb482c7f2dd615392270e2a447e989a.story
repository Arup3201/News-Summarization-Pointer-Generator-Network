Adam Scott, Scott Strange and Wade Ormsby lead the Australian PGA Championship on 10 under par going into Sunday's final day.

Ormsby and Strange led at the halfway stage after Friday's rain-hit play, and a day later they were joined at the top of the leaderboard by world number three Scott to set up an intriguing final round.

Scott carded four birdies and a bogey in his three-under-par 69, picking up shots at the third, ninth, 12th and 15th holes, but dropping a shot at the sixth.

Strange joined Orsmby in carding a 71 for the day, also with four birdies and three bogeys, as he picked up shots at the sixth, ninth, 12th and 15th, but dropped shots at the first, 14th and 17th.

Jason Scrivener trails his Australian countrymen by a shot after recording a 68, and he is joined on nine under by American Boo Weekley, who carded a four-under-par 68.

New Zealander Michael Hendry signed for a 67 to record the best round of the day courtesy of five birdies. The Aucklander is sixth, two shots off the pace, with fellow Kiwi David Smail two shots back on six under alongside American Scott Stallings.
