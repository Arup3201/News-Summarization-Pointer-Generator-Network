About two dozen protesters rallied outside Bill Cosby's show in Pueblo Friday night, but the comedian's performance went off without a hitch.

The Pueblo Chieftain reports the demonstrators chanted "no means no" and "Colorado believes the women."

The 77-year-old comedian is facing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He's denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged.

Finished? Bill Cosby isn't backing down in the face of  protests at his performances

Protesting: Eric Verlo stands on Union Avenue in front of Memorial Hall in Pueblo, Colorado to protest an appearance by Bill Cosby. A group of about 25 people gathered before the show with signs and chanting

Bill Cosby released this statement to The Denver Post: 'Dear Fans: I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful.

'I'm ready!... I thank you, the theatre staff, the event organizers and the Colorado Community for your continued support and coming to experience family, fun entertainment....

'Hey, Hey, Hey - I'm Far From Finished.' 

Cosby is slated for two Saturday shows in Denver, where protesters are expected to gather outside the downtown venue.

Cosby released a statement Thursday thanking his "courageous" fans and saying he's ready to perform.

He finished his statement with references to his "Fat Albert" character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special — "Hey, Hey, Hey — I'm Far From Finished." 

In the most recent allegation, a model claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.

Chloe Goins met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges against the comedian over the incident almost seven years ago.

More than 15 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, including several who say the comedian drugged and raped them in incidents dating back at least four decades.

Prosecutors rejected filing charges against Cosby based on allegations by Judy Huth, a Riverside County resident who is suing the comedian, alleging he abused her in the early 1970s when she was 15 years old. Huth's lawsuit states the abuse happened at the Playboy Mansion.

Speaking up: Rayla Riddick holds up a light to a sign during a protest of a Bill Cosby. The Bill Cosby show, "Far From Finished", was nearly sold out on Friday  evening -- but that didn’t stop dozens of protesters from coming out 

Show must go on: The organizer of the protest, Rae Carnevale, said the message she's trying to convey is personal.  The show went on despite sexual assault accusations against Cosby by a number of women

Los Angeles police Commander Andrew Smith said that he could not confirm any investigation into Cosby and that sex abuse cases are 'extremely confidential'.

Neither Smith nor Kuvin would speculate on what charges Cosby might face, and both noted that the statute of limitations for sex offenses are complex and depend on the facts of a case.

Cosby's attorney has denied some of the accusations against the comedian, saying they have been discredited or come from discredited accusers.

Cosby joked about the allegations against him at a recent show in Canada.

'We hope that the people that are paying to attend Mr. Cosby's shows understand that these victimized women have broken their silence now and they will not remain quiet any longer,' Kuvin said.

'Mr. Cosby should, and will be held accountable for what he's done.'

He said women reporting abuse 'should be encouraged and not joked about'. 

Rumours: More than a dozen women have accused Cosby of sexually assaulting and drugging them. Cosby, however, denies the allegations and hasn't been charged 

Meanwhile, the door is firmly shut to Bill Cosby's return to NBC, the network's top entertainment executive said Friday.

'That's safe to say,' NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said Friday when asked if the network would ever again do a project with Cosby, who 30 years ago was the sitcom king with the network's 'The Cosby Show.'

The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with him.

The series was announced in mid-2014, before a rising tide of accusations against Cosby by women who say he drugged and assaulted them.

During a question and answer session with the Television Critics Association, Greenblatt was asked to explain what tipped the network against working with Cosby, who was publicly fending off allegations from two women a decade ago.

'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of,' Greenblatt said. Although Cosby hasn't been proven guilty of anything, 'when that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation' and the network didn't want to proceed with the sitcom.

He's glad NBC 'is out from under that,' Greenblatt said.

Pressed to say precisely what number of accusers is seen as critical mass, Greenblatt replied: 'Fifteen, yes, two no.'
