Young Indonesians have staged a defiant protest against Tony Abbott and his campaign to save Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from the death penalty outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta.

Hundreds of students and other protesters carried signs that read slogans including 'Go to hell Abbott with your druggies' and 'Abbott love druggies, we hate druggies!' during the demonstration in Indonesia's capital on Wednesday.

The anti-drug protesters also held signs warning Mr Abbott to watch his words, in response to his comments that Indonesia should pardon the Bali Nine duo to 'reciprocate' the $1 billion aid Australia sent after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

The anti-drug protesters also held signs warning Mr Abbott to watch his words, in response to his comments that Indonesia should pardon the Bali Nine duo to 'reciprocate' the $1 billion tsunami aid Australia sent in 2004

Earlier this week, Indonesian students burnt pictures of Mr Abbott and collected coins to 'repay' the aid in other protests at Malang Square, eastern Java.

On Wednesday, a man wearing a Tony Abbott mask and walking behind a set of mock prison bars led protesters carrying signs that read 'Mr Abbott take care with your mouth. Don't ruin Indonesia-Australia friendship', 'We are freedom country' and 'Keep against druggies – Abbott'.

This comes amid reports Chan and Sukumaran are keeping their spirits up even as authorities around them say they should come to terms with Indonesia's determination to execute them soon.

Kerobokan jail governor Sudjonggo says he has no word on when they will be transferred to Nusakambangan, the island Indonesia is preparing for the executions of the Bali Nine pair and eight other drug offenders.

Mr Abbott said: 'Let's not forget that a few years ago, when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars' worth of assistance, we sent a significant contingent of our armed forces to help in Indonesia with humanitarian relief, and Australians lost their lives in that campaign to help Indonesia'

Last week Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who was been leading the diplomatic campaign to save the duo, was forced to clarify that Australian was not threatening to withdraw foreign aid to Indonesia should Chan and Sukumaran be executed.

Mr Abbott said: 'We will be letting Indonesia know in absolutely unambiguous terms that we feel grievously let down.

'Let's not forget that a few years ago, when Indonesia was struck by the Indian Ocean tsunami, Australia sent a billion dollars' worth of assistance, we sent a significant contingent of our armed forces to help in Indonesia with humanitarian relief, and Australians lost their lives in that campaign to help Indonesia.

'I would say to the Indonesian people and the government, we in Australia are always there to help you and we hope that you might reciprocate in this way at this time.'

Tony Abbott called the Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday night and described the conversation over the fate of the two Australians on death row as positive.

'Suffice it to say that the president absolutely understands our position,' Mr Abbott said. 

Mr Abbott said of his conversation on Wednesday he thought President Widodo was carefully considering Indonesia's position. 

'I don't think it would help the case of these two young Australians if I was to start ventilating in public the contents of the conversation,' he told reporters in Canberra on Thursday.

The president previously rejected clemency for convicted drug runners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

This comes amid reports Chan and Sukumaran are keeping their spirits up even as authorities around them say they should come to terms with Indonesia's determination to execute them soon

It comes as lawyers for the Bali Nine duo lodged an appeal after they lost a bid to challenge Indonesia's presidential decree to spare the men from execution on Tuesday. 

Their lawyers  now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey.

'(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said.

'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot.

'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.' 

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed on Wednesday that Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her son from the firing squad.   

'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show.

'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' 

Last week Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who was been leading the diplomatic campaign to save the duo, was forced to clarify that Australian was not threatening to withdraw foreign aid to Indonesia should Chan and Sukumaran be executed 

Ms Bishop said both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way and were helping to rehabilitate other prisoners in Bali

'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.'

Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist.

'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners.

'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.'
