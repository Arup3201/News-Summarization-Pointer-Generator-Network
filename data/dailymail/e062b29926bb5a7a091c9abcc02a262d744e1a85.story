Education Minister Chris Pyne has been told to ‘man up’ by the Today Show’s Karl Stefanovic, who blasted ‘you can’t even get your policy through your own people’.

Stefanovic stuck his teeth into Pyne a day after he grilled Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the axed carbon tax and federal budget, saying: ‘No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem.’

'The reality here is that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse,’ he told the PM, as it was revealed Abbott’s popularity has fallen.

Pyne appeared on the Today Show to discuss his unpopular Higher Education reforms as the government vowed it will launch a second attempt to pass them despite a Senate defeat on Tuesday.

When Stefanovic pointed out ‘not even your own party has any faith in your arguments for existing reforms,’ Pyne argued: ’75 per cent of the budget is through.’

‘Here’s the issue you can’t get your own policies through the Senate - and yes it’s hostile - but you can’t even get it through your own people,’ Karl laughed.

‘That’s not right Karl… I’m not in the least bit dismayed… my view is that’s democracy… this morning I am bouncing back and puting up a new reform bill,’ Pyne said.

On Tuesday night Pyne was forced to deny that he ‘harassed’ senators in order to get them to support his higher education reforms, insisting that he holds an 'excellent relationship' with the Senate's crossbenchers.

Palmer United Party Senator Glenn Lazarus accused the Education Minister of pestering him and others in a statement, saying he'd been 'inundated with text messages from Christopher Pyne' despite having never given him his mobile number.

But Mr Pyne dismissed the accusations, suggesting that the 'seven or eight' messages he'd sent Senator Lazarus were entirely acceptable and telling ABC's 7.30 Report that he would be 'happy to send him more'.

Asking him about the allegations, Stefanovic jibed: ‘He’s a newly minted senator with virtually no experience, he was mocking you.’ 

Pyne vowed he will bounce back and propose a new version of the Higher Education reforms 

He denied he was being blackmailed when Stefeanovic probed him about senators who did not vote for his reforms

‘That’s a matter for Senator Lazarus. I intend to have a great relationship with him,’ Pyne replied.

Announcing: ‘Today we’ll introduce a new higher education reform bill that picks up a lot of the issues that were raised by the crossbenchers, none by Labor or the Greens they are just saying “no” and are not part of the debate at all.’

‘Whose fault is it that the bill was rejected?,’ Stefanovic asked.

‘Well the crossbenchers, the Labors and the Greens didn’t vote for it – four of the crossbenches did… great reform takes time, there is an inevitability about it because it’s great for our universities and students,’ Pyne said.

Stefanovic continued his offence: ‘Ultimately you’ve got massive dramas getting any bill passed do you think that the senators are holding the country to ransom at the moment – are they blackmailing the country?’

The Prime Minister appeared on Channel Nine's Today show on Tuesday morning and faced a barrage of questions from host Karl Stefanovic over his controversial budget decisions

Avoiding answering the question, Pyne said: ‘As I see this, it is round two. As I said to Clive Palmer if it loses the first time it will be like losing the first test of a five test series.’

‘They are blackmailing you in a way though aren’t they?,’ Stefanovic retorted.

‘I wouldn’t say that,’ Pyne said.

‘I think the PM said something like that yesterday “this is a form of blackmail”,’ Stefanovic reasoned.

‘I think he was saying… voting no in the Senate because you can’t have your way on one particular thing is not the way to negotiate with the government or with anybody,’ Pyne said.

Stefanovic finished: ‘Why don’t you just double dissolution, man up and get on with it?

‘We’ve had a great year,’ Pyne replied.

The Abbott government will have another go at overhauling universities, defying defeat and bringing a new-look bill before parliament.

Pyne will on Wednesday introduce a redrafted bill to deregulate universities, after the Senate knocked back the first attempt on Tuesday.

Despite pleading with crossbench senators, the government failed to convince enough to jump on board the policy.

The government will have to work on the Palmer United Party, Jacqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon to get the new bill through the Senate early next year.

The redrafted bill will include other crossbench amendments that dump plans to increase interest rates on HECS and freeze interest charges while new parents take time out to raise kids.

It will also include a scholarship fund targeted towards disadvantaged and rural students.

On Tuesday Pyne also made an ironic slip when pronouncing the name of cross bencher Zhenya 'Dio' Wang while insisting he had an 'excellent relationship' with him - a mistake that was quickly pointed out by ABC reporter Leigh Sales.

'Well some people pronounce it Wang, some people pronounce it Wong; it depends where you are on the spectrum. But if you wish to pick me up on that Leigh, that's a very small thing and I'm surprised you'd bother with it. Never the less, Dio and I are good friends and I will continue to try and get their support,' he replied to the quip.

Clearly put-off by the slip, Mr Pyne then scolded Ms Sales, instructing her to study a bachelor of political science after being asked about the frequency of which he met with the crossbenchers and the quality of the relationships they shared.

'I have met with some of the crossbenchers many, many times – in fact I've met with some of them six or seven or eight times, but I'm not going to go through the day-to-day machinations of how government works, Leigh,' he said.

'You can go and study that at university if you wish to, in a bachelor of political science. The reality is that I'm working closely with the cross bench, I secured four of their votes today and I'll be back at it again tomorrow with a new reform bill.'
