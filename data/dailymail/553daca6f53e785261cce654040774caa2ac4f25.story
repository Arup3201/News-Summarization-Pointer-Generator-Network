Jose Angel Garcia-Jauregui: The 27-year-old, accused of killing a police officer and wounding another on Thursday, has died after being shot by police

A 27-year-old man accused of killing one deputy and wounding another in a violent shoot-out in Utah has died.

Jose Angel Garcia Juaregui died in hospital yesterday after being shot by law enforcement officials on Thursday afternoon in Juab County, The Salt Lake Tribune reported.

The Salt Lake County man was accused of opening fire on a two-lane highway, then clashing with officers during a 50-mile chase that ended with him wounded and arrested.

The officer who was killed, Utah County Sheriff’s Sgt. Cory Wride, was shot while sitting behind the wheel of his police vehicle. He leaves behind a wife and five children.

Wride had pulled up to a truck that appeared disabled near the town of Eagle Mountain, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City.

He spoke with the suspect and apparently was using his computer to do a background check when the truck’s back window slid open and the suspect opened fire, according to Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy.

The gunman shot and injured a second Utah County deputy, 38-year-old Greg Sherwood, near Santaquin, more than 30 miles into the chase.

Sherwood remains in a critical condition with a head wound, but he is expected to recover, the sheriff said.

The gunman took off again, driving south on Interstate 15, but he crashed his car and hijacked another at gunpoint, Tracy said.

The man shot at other motorists who unwittingly stopped to help him, but he didn’t hit any of them, the sheriff said.

The suspect was captured near Nephi after a 20-mile chase and a gunfight with Juab County deputies.

Krista Black, manager of the Maverick convenience store and gas station on the rural highway where Wride was killed, said her husband slowed to check on a disabled car he believes was the suspect’s about 10 minutes before the shooting.

Her husband didn’t get out of his car to help because no one appeared to be in the other car. He instead drove on.

'It makes you nervous about who is out there,' Black told The Associated Press. 'My husband always stops to help people.'

The sheriff said Wride was a 19-year veteran of the Utah County Sheriff’s Office.

Wride leaves behind a 'really close family,' his cousin Blaine Wride told The Salt Lake Tribune.

'They’re always involved with each other.'

The deputy and his wife had built a house on a section of his grandfather’s farm in the community of Benjamin, and owned horses and a few cows. Cory Wride also was active in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

'He was a good man,' Tracy said, according to KSL-TV.

'He was a very helpful person. And that’s what he was doing, helping people, when he was shot.'

Authorities had searched the suspect’s house in Salt Lake County with a warrant, and a prosecutor told the AP he would have faced multiple felony charges, with the possibility of the death penalty.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported Garcia Jauregui had previously served 4.5 years in prison for attempted murder and also had a felony charge for assault by a prisoner dismissed.

Tracy said the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole released Garcia Jauregui, but it had issued a warrant for his arrest just days before Wride's slaying.

The paper said that court records revealed Garcia Jauregui stabbed a man 21 times with a Phillips screwdriver after running him over with his car in Springville in 2008.

After the stabbing, he assaulted another man with a tire iron or crowbar, causing a fracture to the man’s face.
