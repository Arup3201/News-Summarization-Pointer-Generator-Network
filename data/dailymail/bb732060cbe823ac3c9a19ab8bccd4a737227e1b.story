It is one of the few certainties of air travel.

You can normally assume that – after all the ticket checks and security procedures – if you are allowed onto an aircraft, it is the plane that will be taking you to your destination.

'Traumatised': Stacey McGuinness found herself at the wrong airport

But this was not the case for a Scottish holidaymaker who found herself 300 miles from home last week after low-cost carrier Jet2 dropped her in the wrong country.

This mistake led to red faces at the airline – and a long taxi ride for the weary tourist.

Stacey McGuinness, 27, from Dundee, had just enjoyed a ten-day break in Turkey with her family.

She was due to fly home from Dalaman, in the south-west of Turkey, on Friday – and was booked onto the 11.05pm Jet2 flight to Glasgow.

Three hours later, she found herself not just at the wrong airport, but in the wrong country, after the plane landed at Leeds-Bradford Airport.

The confusion began at Dalaman Airport.

‘The screen said to go to gate 33 for the flight to Glasgow,’ Ms McGuinness says.

‘But when I went to the desk it said Leeds-Bradford.’

‘When I asked at the desk, they said “this is the right one”.

‘I asked them to check again just before we boarded, but they still said I was in the right place.

‘I got to my seat fine. The plane was quite empty anyway.’

Despite the assurances that she was on the right flight, Stacey's nightmare situation was confirmed when the captain told the passengers they were just one hour from touching down in England.

Forced to apologise: Budget airline Jet2 put Stacey McGuinness onto the wrong flight at Dalaman Airport

When the plane landed, Stacey met a Jet2 manager, who apologised for the mistake.

Her luggage was nowhere to be seen.

The airline decided to call for a taxi to take her on a five-hour journey back to Dundee.

But Stacey said the gesture was not enough.

She still hasn't received her baggage, and she wants compensation for her whole ordeal.

‘The manager said it shouldn't have happened, and that I could have been a terrorist or anything’ she says.

‘He ordered me a taxi all the way back to Dundee, and the taxi driver did not want the journey at all.

‘I got back in the end, but all my clothes and valuables are in my suitcase that I still haven't got back, and the customer services are telling me nothing.'

Jet2 have been unable to comment on the issue of how she ended up on the wrong flight.

However, they have said that Ms McGuinness's luggage will be returned to her today.

A spokeswoman for Jet2 said: ‘Ms McGuinness's baggage has arrived with us and will be delivered today. Jet2 apologises for the inconvenience.’

Stacey, who lives in Douglas, a suburb of Dundee, says: ‘I asked twice if I was in the right place, and each time they said that I was.

‘I still can't believe what has happened.

'I won't be travelling with Jet2 again. I'm scared to even fly at all now.

‘I was on my own, which made it worse. I was really traumatised.’
