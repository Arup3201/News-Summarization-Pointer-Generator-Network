A 19-year-old woman has been arrested and charged for allegedly attacking her husband with a spatula.

Sophie Guite was released on $400 bail this week after being held on one charge of domestic violence assault in Winterport, a town in central Maine.

The incident started Sunday morning when the young woman sent a friend a text saying she had been hit by her husband, Jerry Conary, Chief Deputy Jeff Trafton of the Waldo County Sheriff's Office told Bangor Daily News.

Deputy Darrin Moody went to the residence.

Sophie, her younger brother, Charles Guite - who was at the house at the time - and Conary were interviewed.
