Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has taken a swipe at Manchester United by claiming his club operate without any debt.

City were punished by UEFA last week for breaching financial fair play rules and handed a 60m euro fine. But, in an interview with the club's website, Mubarak said that UEFA action will not change City's strategy and business model.

Manchester United were, at one point, £700m in debt under the ownership of Malcolm Glazer. Their latest financial report last week stated that United's debt was down 4.3 per cent at £351.7m.

Sustainable: Khaldoon Al Mubarak said Manchester City have the right business model

The City chairman said: 'This year we will break even. Next year, we will make a profit. We have a sustainable project, we have zero debt and we don't pay a penny to service any debt. 

'For me that's a sustainable model. However, our friends at UEFA seem to believe otherwise. They have their view, we have ours. It will not compromise our strategy.

'We will always do what is best for this club and the fans. If it means 
that we have to take a pinch then we will do so. But we know that we 
have the right model and will believe in the model.

Sanctioned: City were punished by UEFA for their failure to comply with Financial Fair Play rules

'There is a philosophy with how we run our club and our football. Six 
years ago we embarked on this journey. It's been a wonderful journey and
 today we are where we wanted to be six years ago. We have brought in 
both footballing success and commercial success and this model works.

'Over six years, step by step, we have invested in this club. We have invested in top players around the world and continued on in our commercial strategy. We went on a commercial blitz over six years and have partners all over the world. We have offices in Kuala Lumpur and have signed 38 commercial agreements in the last two years.

'I came to Manchester six years ago and we had 130 or 140 people working at City. We have gone a long way from that club six years ago to where we are today.'

Squeeze: Manchester United were £700m in debt at one point under the ownership of Malcolm Glazer

City won their second Premier League title in three years this season having finished two points clear of Liverpool.

Their squad for the Champions League next season will be reduced to 21 players as a result of their failure to comply with UEFA's FFP regulations.
