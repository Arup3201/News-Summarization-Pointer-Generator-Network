Britons have been urged to stay vigilant after it emerged that a dog had passed TB on to a child in the first ever recorded case in the country.

The youngster, who was under 10, was infected with bovine tuberculosis after catching it from their family pet in Gloucestershire last year.

It comes just days after nine cats were revealed to have been infected by the killer disease in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers.

Two people from the same household were treated for TB after they contracted the disease from their kitten, while two other adults were infected with a dormant form of the bug.

The child who was infected by a dog was diagnosed with symptom-free 'latent' TB after health officials discovered the pet was infected.

The youngster later made a full recovery, but the diseased pet was destroyed by vets.

Now, experts have warned pet owners to stay vigilant, confirming that both dogs and cats are capable of passing on the deadly disease.

'There has been a recent human case of a child catching TB from an infected dog they were living with,' animal health expert, Professor Danielle Gunn-Moore, told The Sun. 'The child is better now.'

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Public Health England said the youngster's entire family had been screened as a 'precautionary measure'.

On Thursday, the Daily Mail revealed nine cats were infected with TB in the Home Counties in a matter of weeks.

Six were put down or have died, two have survived, but one, an 18-month-old tabby called Milhouse, has run away.

 of the cats had bite wounds, which vets say probably came from fighting
 with badgers, which are prolific carriers of bovine TB.

Jessica Livings, 19, was among those infected by TB after reportedly catching the disease from her pet kitten as she cleaned a wound on its body.

How the story was reported in Thursday's Daily Mail

The teenager was struck down with pneumonia and had to have emergency 
surgery, before being later rushed back to hospital for further treatment for severe lung damage.

‘I lost a stone and half in five weeks, I was very ill and had fevers, 
cold sweats and hallucinations. I didn’t realise what was real and what 
wasn’t,' Miss Livings said on Thursday.

The teenager was diagnosed with the disease in October after a vet raised concerns about an outbreak among cats in the Newbury area of Berkshire.

She is now categorised as being at no risk of passing on TB despite her emergency readmission to the Royal Berkshire Hospital last month.

However, her kitten later died from the illness.

It is rare for cats to contract TB, with about 25 cases each year in Britain. The nine infected cats all lived within three miles of each other –  and six within a 250-yard radius.

Deadly: Bovine TB has ravaged the British farming industry, with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the disease each year. Above, the bacteria that causes TB

Dr Gorman, clinical director of the 
Falkland Veterinary Clinic in Newbury, said the disease had its roots in
 an outbreak of bovine TB among cows on the outskirts of the town.

Bovine TB has ravaged the British 
farming industry, with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the 
disease each year.

Badgers are blamed for accelerating its spread, and 
the Government is trialling a controversial cull of the animals to limit
 the problem.
