Nathalie Heil, 30, believed she owned the property

A single mother seized her neighbor's home and rented it out on Craigslist - after the property had already been foreclosed.

Nathalie Heil, 30, collected more than $13,000 in rent since mid-June last year before the property's owners realized what was happening.

She was arrested Friday, facing charges of grand theft and fraud, but was released 
Saturday after posting a $6,000 bond.

The house, in West Palm Beach, Florida, is rightfully owned by Juan Cedano and managed by his daughter-in-law, Kelly Kefner.

Ms Keefner told police she had not checked on the property in 
the last eight months because the home is in 
foreclosure. 

She said when she visited in late January, the house appeared to be inhabited. Ms Keefner returned to the home with her
husband and met April Wehle, 24, and Talia Williams, 25, who said they 
had been renting the home for $1,500 a month since the summer.

The women said they found the place through a Craigslist ad placed by Heil, who lives next door.

The women told police they had paid a 
total of $13,500 in rent by check to Heil and spent another $500 to make 
various repairs on the property, according to Heil’s arrest report. 

Heil believed she owned the house 
as the result of an archaic law in Florida which allows squatters to 
take ownership if they stay in a home for seven years without permission from the owner, pay taxes and maintain the property.

She said the property was abandoned 
more than six years ago and she assumed she owned it immediately after 
filing 'adverse possession' papers with the courts.

There are two types of adverse possession.

Adverse possession under color of title means ownership is based on a written document in the County Public Records.

The document need not be valid, provided the person claiming possession believes it s valid.

The property must actually have been used or enclosed to claim possession.

Without a color of title (if there are no documents) the law requires more than mere possession.

The occupant must pay property taxes, maintain the property and keep possession of it for seven years without permission of the legal owner.

Andre De Palma Barbosa, 23, used adverse 
possession to move into an empty foreclosed 7,000-square-foot mansion in
Boca Raton in December.

'Legally, I thought it was right,' she told the Palm Beach Post.

Heil told police she had gone to the county courthouse and completed paperwork giving her possession of the residence.

Police said they found no record of the paperwork, and property records name Mr Cedeno as the owner.

After confirming Mr Cedeno’s ownership —
the county property appraiser lists him as the owner of record dating back to 
2007 — police said they confronted Heil when she went to the home to 
collect rent.

'I legally subletted my house, there’s three sides to every story,' she said, noting that Ms Wehle and Ms Williams still live there.

Heil said she had received death threats since reports of the incident appeared in the media.

'I’m freaking out,' she said. 'I have a full-time job and I’m a single mom.'

Realtor Laura 
Pearlman, not speaking specifically about the Heil case. warned that people who rent property from 
Craigslist should be cautious.

'Craigslist, that’s like a haven for scam artists,' Pearlman said.

'Don’t give money to anyone unless you know it’s going to the owner or the property management company or a realtor,' she said.
