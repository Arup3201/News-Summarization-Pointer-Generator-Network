The Delhi gang-rape victim's father has called on all countrymen to watch a banned documentary which showed his daughter's killer blaming the student for 'being out at night'.

India's Daughter was described as the 'bitter truth' by the young woman's father after it quoted the views of her rapist Mukesh Singh, who is on death row over the 2012 attack. 

The film by award-winning Briton Leslee Udwin, who produced 1999 indie hit East is East, was due to air on the BBC and Indian news channel NDTV to mark International Women's Day this Sunday.

But it was dropped by NDTV following a ban on the film by the Indian government, and the BBC brought forward its screening to last night, citing a strong public interest.

'Everyone should see it': The father of the New Delhi bus gang-rape victim (pictured left with her mother) has urged his countrymen to watch a BBC documentary on the crime despite India's government banning it

Today India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowed there would be consequences for the Corporation, telling NDTV: 'We had asked to not release the documentary but BBC still released it.

'We will investigate and the MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) will take action accordingly. The conditions have been breached so action will be taken accordingly. I won't comment any further.'

The hour-long documentary aired as part of the long-running Storyville series on BBC Four, and is believed to have been accessed by many in India on sites such as YouTube.

Today the victim's family showed their support for the film, saying the rapist's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think.

The victim's father, who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies, told NDTV the film was 'the bitter truth'.

Horror: The crew obtained an interview with killer Mukesh Singh, who said the student was to blame

'Everyone should watch the film,' he said. 'If a man can speak like that in jail, imagine what he would say if he was walking free?'

The victim's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed Singh's views were widespread in India.

'I don't care what the government does, bans the film, doesn't ban the film, the only thing I know is that nobody is afraid,' she said. 'It is not only Mukesh who thinks like this.'

Mukesh Singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student, who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in December 2012.

Once inside, bus driver Singh, his brother Ram, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, 28, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, 19, and an unnamed teenager launched the attack.

The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. 

She died a fortnight later after suffering terrible injuries to her abdomen, genitals and intestines.

Her death prompted mass protests and led to speedier trials and tougher penalties for rape.

Yet many still hold the firm belief that women are subservient - illustrated by convict Singh, who told the documentary his victim would still be alive if she had not objected.

'When being raped, she shouldn't fight back,' he said. 'She should just be silent and allow the rape... Then they'd have dropped her off after "doing her", and only hit [her friend] the boy.'

He claimed 'you can't clap with one hand - it takes two' and insisted: 'A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night.

Film-maker Leslee Udwin, an award-winner who produced the 1999 hit East is East, said: 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it'

Protest: Jyoti's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second-class citizens

'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. Boy and girl are not equal. Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.

'About 20 per cent of girls are good.'

The views, which have prompted horror around the world, are not exclusive to the girl's attacker.

The rapists' own defence lawyer ML Sharma told the documentary: 'We have the best culture. In our culture, there is no place for a woman.'

Home Minister Rajnath Singh said of the film: 'Under no circumstances should this be telecast'

A second defence lawyer, AP Singh, said if his daughter or sister 'engaged in pre-marital activities... in front of my entire family, I would put petrol on her and set her alight'.

The exact reasons for the government's ban were initially mired in confusion. 

Home Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament yesterday that the government sought the ban because Singh's comments were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'.

One government minister, M Venkaiah Naidu, called it a 'conspiracy to defame India'.

There were heated questions over how the documentary crew gained permission to interview the convicted rapist amid concerns he was being given a platform. 

Spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the New Delhi police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film's 'objectionable content' could cause public disorder.

Yet campaigners criticised the government for appearing more worried about the country's reputation than about the dangers women face.

'Banning this movie is not the answer,' said Anu Agha, an independent MP. 'We have to confront the issue that men in India do not respect women and any time there is a rape, blame is put on the woman.' 

Film-maker Ms Udwin said: 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest. Now, everyone is going to want to see it.'
