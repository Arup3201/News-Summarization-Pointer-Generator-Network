Roy Hodgson has scheduled an unprecedented meeting with England fans in Florida as part of his pre-World Cup charm offensive.

The manager is due to take part in a question-and-answer session in downtown Miami on Thursday despite his England team being just a week away from their first game against Italy.

Grilling: Roy Hodgson will sit down with fans in Florida ahead of the World Cup

The willingness of Hodgson to engage with fans contrasts with the approach of his predecessors, who might have taken part in stage-managed sponsorship events in the UK but never on the road with a tournament beckoning.

After a remarkably calm build-up to Brazil, Hodgson’s dilemma over whether to play the out-of-form Wayne Rooney in Manaus on June 14 will surely be a subject he is asked about.

And fans will not countenance FA spin doctors deciding what questions can be put to Hodgson, with even a query about David Beckham being ruled out at the last Press briefing.

Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist with the England World Cup party, sat in on Roy Hodgson’s pre-match media conferences at The Grove last Thursday. But it would have been far more beneficial for him to witness Hodgson in interviews straight after games when the pressure on any manager is so much greater.

Pele is not just cashing in on the World Cup. Legends 10, run by former Tottenham director Paul Kemsley, have bought the Brazil icon’s intellectual property rights and are doing as many deals as possible to take advantage of the 2016 Rio Olympics build-up.

It will not be one of his bigger paydays but Pele has agreed to do an interview with Gary Lineker which the BBC football presenter is flying out to Brazil early to record.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who has promised to meet various anti-discrimination groups in the wake of his sexist email exchanges with TV rights lawyer Nick West, has started at the top.

Scudamore had a meeting at the  Ritz last week with CONCACAF confederation chief Jeffrey Webb, who heads FIFA’s anti-discrimination task force.

Former FA vice-chairman David Dein, one of football’s great networkers, is expected to help Greg Dyke implement his commission findings.

FA chairman Dyke, who is likely to receive a negative reception to his B team proposals at the Football League conference this week, needs all the support he can get to ensure his recommendations aren’t kicked into the long grass.

And Dein, a close contact of Dyke’s since they were both part of the Premier League formation group, is understood to have discussed how he could assist — having strong views himself on improving the England team. An official role for Dein has yet to be agreed.

Culture secretary Sajid Javid has shown little interest in sport since arriving at the DCMS. But that is not stopping him taking a trip to Brazil for England’s third group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on June 24.  Minister for Sport Helen Grant will be in Sao Paulo for the Uruguay match on June 19.

FIFA snub to Cameron

The email files of disgraced former FIFA ExCo member Mohamed bin Hammam might not be the smoking gun that derails the 2022 Qatar World Cup, but they give more detail about England’s doomed 2018 bid.

It is now clear that in the build-up to the Zurich election, Baroness Amos, Prince Andrew and David Cameron all failed to get time with Bin Hammam, whose vote they were courting.

Meanwhile, just as the Premier League are considering a police complaint over secretary Rani Abraham acquiring chief executive  Richard Scudamore’s private emails so, it is understood, is Bin Hammam over how the  Sunday Times gained possession of his cache.

Good luck message: Cameron visited England during their training session at St George's Park on Thursday

Sven Goran Eriksson, now coaching in China, jumped at every commercial opportunity during his time in charge of the England team. And the Swede has chosen the eve of the World Cup to launch his own red and white Italian wines for the Scandinavian market — named, unimaginatively, Sven.
