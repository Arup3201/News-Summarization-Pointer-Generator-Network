If the expression on the face of this fossilised fish is any indication, life beneath the waves a few million years ago was no fun at all.

Unearthed by scientists in Mexico, the well-preserved fossil reveals the previously undiscovered species' bones, its fins - and its distinctly grumpy-looking face.

Paleontologists in Chiapas also uncovered an equally angry-looking prehistoric pal at a quarry in the Sierra Madre formation. Both of the newly discovered species are believed to date back 110 million years.

One feisty fossil: The remains of the 'Zoqueichthys Carolinae' was discovered by scientists in Chiapas, Mexico, and is thought to date back 110 million years

The specimens were collected at the El Chango Quarry in Chiapas, southern Mexico.

The first, known as Zoqueichthys Carolinae, has been identified as a new member of the 'super family' Aipichthyoidea - a now extinct group of bony fish.

The second discovery was Pepemkay Maya, classed as a new member of the lissoberycinae family.Â

The creatures' names can now be added to the gallery of gruesome sea creatures that populated the oceans millions of years ago.

In October a team of scientists shed new light on the appearance of the prehistoric Compagopiscis fish using the latest high-energy X-rays to create a 3D image of what the extinct creature would have looked like.

The fearsome results revealed the 380 million year old fish had both jaws and teeth. The discovery suggested that humans too may have developed working teeth and jaws earlier than previously suspected.
