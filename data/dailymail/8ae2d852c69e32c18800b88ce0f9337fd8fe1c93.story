The Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns may have been playing for first place in the AFC North on Thursday evening, but for a few minutes between the first and second quarter of the game, that was the last thing on the mind of any players on the field of fans in the stands.

That was when the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Devon Still jerseys, the team's defensive tackle whose young daughter Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June.

The team also honored Leah during this ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game - and see her father play.

Pre-gaming: Devon posted a photo on Instagram of him and Leah enjoying some tea before Thursday's game

Fans got in the spirit too, with some displaying Leah Strong patches on their jerseys and others painting it on their face.

It has been a whirlwind few weeks for Leah, who hopped on a flight from Philadelphia to travel to Cincinnati for Thursday's game, as the young girl also became a bit of a music video star.

Not knowing Leah was the daughter of Devon, she was one of the young children fighting cancer who was selected by Hoda Kotb to be featured in a fundraising effort she started that featured the children singing a mashup of Cyndi Lauper's True Colors and Sara Bareilles' Brave, called Truly Brave.

To date, the video has been viewed over one million times.  

The Bengals (5-2-1) helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. They kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.

‘It's going to be added motivation just knowing my daughter is watching me,’ Still said prior to Thursday night in an interview with WCPO.

‘I want her to be able to hear how the crowd cheers that loud whenever I make a tackle, so I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to put a smile on her face.’ 

Sadly, thought not that it mattered to Leah at all, the Bengals did not come out on top, losing to the Browns 24 to 3.
