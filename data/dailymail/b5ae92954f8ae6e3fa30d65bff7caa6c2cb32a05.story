'Is champers all right with you, Pats?', 'Lovely darling.'

The unmistakeably posh lexicon of hit TV series Absolutely Fabulous, also known as Ab Fab, is set to return to screens as soon as next year, in the form of a feature film, it has been revealed.

The woman behind lead character Patsy Stone - a botox, champagne and drug addicted magazine editor - has confirmed an Ab Fab movie is on the way.

Joanna Lumley, 66, confirming the news reported in the Mail last year that a film was in the pipeline, told the Telegraph: 'We've talked about it, Jennifer 
[Saunders] is writing the film.

'Although 
yesterday the press were saying it's a musical now! But whatever it is, 
I'll be there.'

She also said while she's alive 
no-one but her will play Patsy, even if that means brushing up on her 
all but non-existent singing and dancing skills.

‘Nobody's going to play Patsy when I'm 
alive! I do mean that, I do mean that darling, because it could get 
savage, I'm still quite strong,'

‘I'll learn it, I'll learn it. I'll learn to sing and dance. Don't throw me out,' she said.

Absolutely Fabulous is written by 
Saunders, who also plays leading character Edina Monsoon, a drug and 
drink abusing PR, always after the latest fad and desperate to stay 
young, hip and relevant.

The hit comedy, which launched in the early 1990s, also stars Julia Sawalha, June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks.

Jennifer Saunders' character Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter, Saffron, who is still at school, despite being a middle-aged, twice-divorced working woman.

She told the Mail in April: 'I’ve said it now so I’m going to have to do it, aren’t I?’

‘If I do it for no other 
reason,’ she says, shaking with laughter, ‘I’ll do it so Joanna and I – 
as Patsy and Eddy – can walk the red carpet. Wouldn’t that be a dream?’ 
she told the Mail in April.

'Eddy and Patsy are looking for what they imagine glamorous life should be. They're constantly searching for that perfect place to sit or that perfect pair of sunglasses.

'It's Shangri-La and it just might be round the next corner. In the meantime, they decide to take Saffy's (Julia Sawalha) daughter off her - she calls her Jane, I call her Lola - but then they lose her.'

‘I adore being Edina. It’s a total 
escape. If I think of Edina now, I can’t help smiling. She’s so scatty.

'When I’m Eddy and Joanna’s Patsy, there’s no happier place to be. It 
must be for us like meditation is for other people.'

The series ended in 2005 but returned 
after six years for just three special episodes, one at Christmas in 
2011, one for new year and one in July 2012 - to mark the show's 20th 
anniversary and celebrate the London Olympics.

Now
that Saunders has finished working on the stage musical Viva Forever!, 
featuring the songs of the Spice Girls à la Mamma Mia!, she can
concentrate on the Ab Fab project and she hopes to release the film in time for the 2014 Oscars.
