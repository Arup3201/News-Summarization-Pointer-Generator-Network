Life sentence: Knife-obsessed Kasim Ahmed, then 17, already had a string of convictions for violence and thefts when he stabbed Thavisha Peiris 14 times

A teenager who murdered a graduate while on bail was a ‘natural born killer’ who should never have been set free, his victim’s family said yesterday.

Knife-obsessed Kasim Ahmed, then 17, already had a string of convictions for violence and thefts when he stabbed Thavisha Peiris 14 times and left him to bleed to death after a failed bid to steal his iPhone.

The Sri Lanka-born victim, 25, had moved to the UK for a better life.

He was killed on his final pizza delivery shift before starting work at an IT consultancy he had set up with some friends. 

Sentencing Ahmed to life in prison yesterday, a judge described the stabbing as a ‘murder waiting to happen’.

And Mr Peiris’s brother Pramod said it was ‘shocking’ that Ahmed was allowed out on bail given his criminal history, which began when he was just 14. 

‘He was a natural born killer with a killer’s instinct and should never have been allowed out of prison,’ the 27-year-old software engineer said.

‘He was clearly a very dangerous man and he should never have been released so he could kill normal people. It is shocking that he was allowed out on the streets to kill my brother.’

The judge sentencing Ahmed said his criminal record was ‘truly terrible for someone so young’, adding: ‘This was a murder waiting to happen.’ 

Mr Justice Coulson described Ahmed as a ‘habitual street robber who always carries a knife with him for that purpose’.

During a two-week trial, Sheffield Crown Court heard that Ahmed and his cousin Shamraze Khan, 26, both from Sheffield, targeted Mr Peiris for his iPhone.

The court was told that Mr Peiris was a hard-worker, described by friends and family as a ‘friendly and gentle person’.

Scene: The street where Sri Lanka-born Mr Peiris was stabbed to death after a failed bid to steal his iPhone

He
 had secured a degree in IT from Sheffield Hallam University after 
leaving his home in the respectable suburbs of Colombo, the capital of 
Sri Lanka, for a better life in Britain.

He worked up to 70 hours a week as a delivery driver for Domino’s to pay back his father Sarath and mother Vajira, who financed his studies in the UK.

But as he parked his car to make his final delivery last October, Ahmed and Khan struck after spotting his phone.

Mr Peiris tried to fend them off, but Ahmed stabbed him 14 times in the neck, chest, face and arms and he suffered fatal wounds to the neck and heart.

The hooded cousins fled without the 
iPhone, leaving their victim to bleed to death in the driver’s seat. 
They were arrested four days later.

Ahmed admitted murder at the start of the trial, and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years.

Mr Justice Coulson said he was satisfied he had wielded the knife, and told him that his sentence would have been considerably longer had he been an adult at the time of the killing.

Khan was found guilty and jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years, although the judge accepted he was unarmed and played a secondary role.

He said Khan, a father of four, was ‘someone his cousin looked up to’, adding: ‘You should have steered him away from serious criminal activity. Instead you became his willing partner.’ 

Khan has a lengthy criminal  record just like his cousin, with convictions for theft, shoplifting and cannabis possession.

After the sentencing, Mr Peiris’s parents said: ‘We sent our son to the UK so he could have a better life. We never thought he would be in danger.

'The way in which he was taken from us is devastating ... we cannot understand why anyone would do this to another human being and it fills us with such sadness.

‘While it doesn’t bring our beloved Thavisha back, we now have some form of solace knowing [his killers] will be held to account for what they have done and they will be going to prison.’ 

The couple spent their life savings sending their son to Britain.

They are now both in their sixties, and struggling for money.

Speaking to the Mail last year, Mr Peiris’s cousin Beena Narangoda described Britain as a ‘glossy red apple with a rotten core’.

The 32-year-old English teacher, who lives in Sri Lanka, added: ‘There is no value put on human life. There are some sections of society who take a life and do not bother about it.’
