A Florida doctor stands to lose his license over accusations that he whipped, choked and blindfolded a naked female patient battling depression, calling it ‘punishment therapy’.

The Lake Worth osteopath, Dr David Simon, who is married, has admitted to having a relationship with his 38-year-old patient after-hours in his office, according to his lawyer.

A settlement has been reached between the doctor and the patient, but on Friday the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine said the allegations against him were so serious that it was going to seek a full administrative hearing.

Serious allegations: Osteopath, Dr David Simon, who has admitted to having a sexual relationship with his 38-year-old patient, stands to lose his license over the incident

Punishment therapy: The doctor is facing accusations of whipping, choking and blindfolding the female patient while she was naked calling it 'punishment therapy' to help deal with her depression

‘He's deeply embarrassed,’ said Simon's attorney, David Spicer, according to the Sun Sentinel.

‘This was a consensual relationship with an adult woman.

‘However, the Board of Health is clear that doctors can't have a sexual relationship with a patient. That's why we worked out the settlement.’

Spicer said that settlement included two years of probation and a $10,000 fine, but the board said the charges were too serious to settle.

He told the board that he would prove that the patient exaggerated, according to Health News Florida.

'You'll find out this is a fantasy. She's spinning all these tales. It wasn't torture. It was adventurous sex between two adults.'

Simon denied that he tortured the patient, identified only by her initials, CK. But he conceded that what he did was 'inappropriate', that it 'crossed a boundary'.

The case ruined his reputation and career, he said. 'I can't excuse it. ... I'm embarrassed for myself, and it has devastated my wife.'

The patient told detectives that Simon 
would blindfold her and have her take off all of her clothing, and would
use whips and handcuffs on her for hours to help with her on-going 
depression, according to WPBF.com.

The woman told detectives Simon had her come in monthly for a year to receive the therapy which included whippings, sexual acts, being locked in a closet and tied up for hours.

She said it all occurred after hours and it happened with her consent. She also said she performed sexual acts on Simon as a ‘thank you’ for the therapy.

Detectives said they discovered whips, blindfolds, handcuffs, rope, clothespins and ‘phallic objects’ in Simon's office, and a rope and a blindfold in his pocket.

'Not true': Loretta Sharpe, 75, who has been a patient of Simon's for 27 years, says she does not 'believe any of it'

An investigative report says the 
whipping and torture of the then 37-year-old woman began in late 2010, 
after she had been Simon’s patient for many years.

CK
told investigators she wanted to stop the sessions but was afraid Simon
would hurt her if she did. She also needed the medication samples he 
gave her, she said.

Loretta Sharpe, 75, a patient of Simon's for nearly 30 years, says she doesn't believe the accusations.

'I've
gone to Dr Simon for 27 years, and when I was 27 years younger, I was a
knock-out. I don’t believe any of it,' she told WPBF.com.

This is not the first time Simon has been accused of sexual harassment.

A Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office report shows a second patient, 24, also reported ‘sexual harassment’ from Simon in 2010, according to WPBF.com.

She told detectives that after a gynecological exam, Simon rubbed her back and the top of her buttocks and said ‘I think you need to be punished for being a bad girl. It seems you really need to be punished’.

No criminal charges have been filed yet.

Simon, who has 29 years of experience as a doctor, attended medical school at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and graduated in 1984.

Doctors of Osteopathy - called D.O.s - are akin to medical doctors, but osteopaths place more emphasis on 'holistic' medicine, integrating hands-on manipulation in addition to conventional testing and treatment.
