Michael Kors officially became a billionaire today after shares of his company rose more than 17per cent on the stock market.

This afternoon Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. peaked at $93.18 on the stock market, later narrowly falling to around the $90 mark.

The increase made the 54-year-old designer approximately $34million wealthier, according to the New York Times.

Taking the cake: Michael Kors officially became a billionaire today after the value of his company's shares went soaring

The 2per cent stake Mr Kors holds in his company is now valued at around $390million, while his other assets are now valued at approximately $650million, Bloomberg reports.

These calculations do not include the values of Mr Kors’s New York apartment or his collection of luxury cars.

Mr Kors’s newly-minted wealth status places him in the rare company of fellow fashion industry billionaires including Tory Burch and Spanx creator Sara Blakely.

The New York Times says that this is just the latest good omen for Kors’s company, which is said to have enjoyed a 77per cent increase in profits in the recent quarter alone.

His brand is highly valued for its strong retail performance with leather accessories and watches.

It enjoys massive success in North American and Asia.

Mr Kors – a drop out of the Fashion Institute of Technology - started his own label in 1981 with the help of a Bergdorf Goodman executive.

His brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1993, and reemerged in 1996 through funding from licensing deals and a design contract with the Japanese label ICB.

Mr Kors also served as the designer, and later creative director of Céline between 1998 and 2004.He primarily resides in New York with husband Lance LaPere.

Mr Kors will present his latest collection during New York Fashion Week on February 12.
