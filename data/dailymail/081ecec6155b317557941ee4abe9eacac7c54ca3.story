Finding the perfect dress can be hard but according to experts this $299 dress ticks all the boxes.

Designer Sacha Drake has taken style tips from experts in recruitment, dating and colour theory to create the burgundy frock.

It is meant to score women the trifecta - the man, the job and the perfect body.

The outfit's capped sleeves hides the most unattractive part of the body - the armpits - and the neckline and shape of the dress frames the face and skims over the body instead of clinging to it.

Experts have given this Sacha Drake dress the tick of approval. The colour red is meant to exude confidence, passion and power

Colour theorist Dr Zena O'Connor said dark red was the ideal colour to wear on a first date.

She said it conveyed confidence, power and passion - what men love in a woman - as well as making the wearer appear slimmer.

'Red is the colour of romance but by choosing a darker tone the message changes from lust to dependability,' Dr O'Connor, from the College of Fine Arts, told The Daily Telegraph.

Wardrobe consultant Dianne Cant, from the June Dally-Watkins Business Finishing College, said the dress flattered in all the right places without sending men the wrong idea.

She said you didn't want your jiggly bits to hang out by camouflaging the bits of your body you didn't like.

'This dress skims the body so it works on most shapes and the scoop neckline frames the face,' Ms Cant said.

It's a winner: The dress fits and flatters in all the right places - and also covers up some of the spots that many women find problematic

But it's not just men you have to worry about - it's job recruiters too.

Launch Recruitment general manager Rebecca Wallis said a small style mistake could mean the difference between getting a job and not getting a job.

She said job interviews were not the time to take fashion risks but to be more conservative in your choices.

The important thing was for the recruiter to focus on your suitability for the job not what you're wearing.

'You are judged on appearance the moment you walk through the door, so you don’t want to leave yourself open to criticism by showing cleavage or wearing skirts that are too short.'
