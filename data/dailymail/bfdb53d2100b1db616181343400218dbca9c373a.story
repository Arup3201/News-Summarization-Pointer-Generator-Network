The wife of a former Mexican mayor reportedly ordered the murder of 43 student teachers, who have since gone missing after being taken into custody by police and allegedly handed over to a drug gang.

Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, wife of Jose Luis Abarca, who used to be mayor of the town of Iguala, is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel.

She ordered the police to arrest 43 students she thought were about to ruin a party she'd organised for herself and hand them over to the murderous gang, according to a news website.

The students went missing on September 26 and it's Pineda who has blood on her hands, The Daily Beast reported.

It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings.

To stop this happening, the site said, she ordered the police to deal with them.

Police then allegedly opened fire on the students after they stopped the buses they were travelling in, killing several, and driving others away on the orders of Guerreros Unidos' chief hitman, 'Chucky'.

She was able to issue these instructions because she is apparently at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala.

According to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes her as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'.

Forensic experts have combed through 11 clandestine graves discovered in the area during the hunt for the students.

The sites contained 38 bodies, but there has been no confirmation that any of them belong to the missing students.

It appears that the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968.

Mr Karam said this week that it was in fact the mayor who ordered the police to confront the students, citing testimony from several officers that have been arrested during the investigation into the case.

Meanwhile, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto yesterday met with parents of the 43 missing students for the first time since they disappeared.

The mothers and fathers of the missing have grown increasingly frustrated at the pace of the investigation.

The case has shaken the image of improving security that the government has sought to project since Pena Nieto took office in 2012.

After meeting for about six hours inside the Los Pinos presidential residence, parents said they told Pena Nieto they did not have confidence in the investigation, and the government agreed to measures including the creation of a commission to monitor the case.

'We are not going to trust the words of the president nor the commitments that were made public ... until they present the 43 students to us alive,' Felipe de la Cruz, one of the parents, said at a news conference late Wednesday.

At one point earlier in the day, human rights officials had said the meeting was over but the family members were refusing to leave until Pena Nieto signed a document that would satisfy everyone.

Pena Nieto said in televised remarks that in addition to the commission, made up of both government officials and parents to provide daily updates on the investigation, the government agreed to provide greater support for both rural teachers colleges and the families of those who were killed or wounded in the attack, and to redouble efforts to determine the students' whereabouts.

'There will be a renewed search plan,' Pena Nieto said.

The relatives came to Mexico City from the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa in Guerrero state, where the missing students were enrolled.

'We are asking them to not just look for them in the graves, not just look for them in the dumps, because we are sure they are alive,' de la Cruz told reporters at a human rights center in the Mexican capital.

Another father of a missing student, Rafael Lopez also expressed frustration at authorities' inability to determine what happened.

'If they can't do it, they should ask for help from the United States,' Lopez said from the school, where he and some of the parents remained Wednesday.

Iguala's former mayor and his wife are fugitives, and 56 people have been detained, including police from Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula as well as the alleged leader of Guerreros Unidos.

Pena Nieto said the rule of law will apply regardless of 'wherever (the investigation) leads.'

The case has spurred anger across the country, and large protest marches demanding action by the government have been held in Mexico City, Acapulco and the capital of Guerrero, Chilpancingo.

Several protests have erupted in violence. On Wednesday, protesters aligned with the teachers college attended by the missing attacked the Guerrero governor's residence Chilpancingo, damaging the front gate and burning an official vehicle outside.
