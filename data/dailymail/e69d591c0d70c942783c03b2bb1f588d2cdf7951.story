Most beauty pageant entrants say they want to see world peace.

And the current Miss Universe now has the opportunity to help stop fighting in her home country of Columbia after being invited to peace talks by Marxist FARC rebels.

Newly-crowned Miss Universe, 22-year-old Paulina Vega, has been asked to peace negotiations between the FARC and the Columbian government, in a bid to end 50 years of fighting.

Miss Vega, a 22-year-old business student from northern Columbia had previously said in interviews she would be willing to travel to the talks 

The business student from Barranquilla in the north of the country had previously said in interviews that she would be willing to travel to the talks.

And in a statement posted on their website, the FARC confirmed they had asked her along to negotiations, taking place in Cuba.

The statement said: 'We have read with interest your desire to contribute with your good work to reaching peace.

'We salute your willingness to travel to Havana, at this time we invite you to make a visit.'

The FARC did not say how Miss Vega's input would help advance the peace talks and it is unclear whether she will take up their invitation.

Miss Vega, a relative pageant newcomer, was crowned Miss Universe last month, beating contestants from more than 80 other countries at the event in Miami.

She said she would wear the crown with 'pride and excitement' as she heard the news that fans in Colombia had taken to the streets to celebrate.

But her victory wasn't without controversy as instead of the usual cheering, the audience erupted into boos of disapproval as favourite-to-win Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennell only made it to fifth place.

Shortly after Miss Fennell, 22, left the stage in the 63rd annual contest, her name began trending on Twitter along with the hashtag #MissJamaicaShouldHaveWon.

Unlike Miss Vega, who looks every inch the beauty queen, Miss Fennell gained a large following due to her striking beauty, confidence intelligence and unconventional style - wearing her hair in a Halle Berry-esque pixie cut instead of the traditional long pageant waves.

Fans claim Miss Fennell was denied the title after she proudly called Usain Bolt, the world's fastest short-distance runner, and reggae-king Bob Marley her country's greatest contributions to the world.

Meanwhile, the FARC has waged an anti-government guerrilla war for the past 50 years over land reform, an end to the illegal drugs trade and political participation for ex-guerrillas.

News of the peace talks come as Colombia's second-largest rebel group said on Wednesday it's willing to lay down its weapons if government-brokered peace talks open political space for leftist groups.

The National Liberation Army made the announcement by releasing a video in which the group's top commander, Nicolas Rodriguez, addresses guerilla fighters gathered in the jungle for a clandestine congress.

Founded 50 years ago by Rodriguez and a group of leftist Roman Catholic priests and activists inspired by Cuba's revolution, the ELN has about 2,000 fighters, compared to some 8,000 for the FARC.

The group, considered a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States, has a long history of kidnapping foreigners for ransom, of extorting businesses and of sabotaging Colombia's main oil pipeline.

The apparent engagement with the ELN comes as Santos tries to close in on a deal with the FARC, holding out this week the possibility of a bilateral ceasefire to reflect what he considers the group's demonstrated commitment to reduce hostilities.
