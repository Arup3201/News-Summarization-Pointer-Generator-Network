Two people have been charged after a three-year-old boy shot a little girl with a .22-caliber rifle.

William Monroe Simmons' daughter, also three, was shot when the gun was allegedly left unattended in the living room of their trailer in Asheboro, North Carolina.

The bullet hit the young girl's arm and then travelled into her abdomen, Randolph County Deputies said.

Sheriff's captain Derek Hill told the Daily Record: 'We’re unsure if they were playing with it or if they picked it up and the gun went off.'

The couple have also been charged with one count of failure to properly store a firearm to protect a minor.

The misedemeanor child abuse charge is related to the unsafe living conditions in the home.

Mumpower told deputies she was cleaning at the time of the shooting.

The two toddlers and another baby belonging to Simmons were in the house at the time.

The baby and the three-year-old who fired the gun are now in the care of social services.  

The rifle belongs to Simmons, according to Daily Record.

The injured girl was transferred to Brenner Children's Hospital where she had surgery but her injuries are not believed to be life threatening.

The parents were arrested at the hospital.

Simmons was being held on $35,500 bond, but posted bail but Mumpower is still being held on a $6,300 bond.
