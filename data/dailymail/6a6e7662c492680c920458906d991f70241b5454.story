A 'strong connection' exists between mass shootings and domestic or family violence, a study has found (file picture)

An analysis of gun murders in the U.S. has found 'a strong connection' between mass shootings and domestic or family violence.

Gun-control advocacy group Everytown For Gun Safety analysed FBI data and media reports to identify a total of 110 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2014.

The group found 57 per cent of mass shootings, defined by the FBI as incidents in which at least four people were murdered with a gun, were related to domestic or family violence.

The analysis also found the victims of mass shootings were disproportionately female.

While just 13 per cent of the total number of victims of gun homicide in the U.S. were female, the figure of female victims in mass shootings was 51 per cent.

The report says in at least 63 of the 110 cases the shooter killed a current or former spouse, partner or other family member.

The Everytown analysis also discovered gunmen who carried out mass shootings were on average older than those who committed gun murders in the U.S. as a whole.

While the median age of all known gun murderers is 26, those who had carried out mass shootings had the average median age of 34.

Under federal law, certain people, including felons, certain domestic abusers and those with a severe mental illness, are not allowed to possess guns.

The analysis found of the 110 mass shootings, it was possible to judge whether the shooter was prohibited from carrying guns in 78 per cent of cases.

Of these 86 incidents, a total of 42 per cent were prohibited, the report claims.

The report also notes mass shootings represent only a small part of the total number of gun murders in the U.S., with less than one per cent of victims recorded by the FBI in 2012 killed in such incidents.

Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post gun laws needed to be tightened.

She said: 'Itâ€™s clear that many of these murders were committed by people already barred from gun ownership by federal law - but that law is full of loopholes, like background checks not being required for private sales, like Craigslist or at gun shows.'
