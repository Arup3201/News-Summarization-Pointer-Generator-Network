It's a vantage point only experienced sailors get to see.

However, a Russian marine climbed the 190ft up the mast of a ship wearing a GoPro to capture the breathtaking view.

Thrillseeker Roman Saitov, a fourth-year cadet at Murmansk State Technical University, filmed the stunning footage that reveals the remarkable scenery as he climbs.

Mr Saitov, who is an avid skier, said he is an amateur alpinist and even when he is at sea he likes to climb.

During the video, the daredevil student scales the six-storey-high mast of the Baroque ship accompanied by a friend to show a day in the life of a skipper.

The camera pans around during the climb as the men go higher and higher, and the view becomes more spectacular.
