It's hard to imagine 20-year-old Kahli Brock, with her stunning long legs and flawless features, ever being the subject of harassment.

But the aspiring model, who is set to represent Queensland as one of 24 finalists in the 2014 Australian Supermodel Of The Year competition, revealed that she feared for her life during her high school years.

'I remember when the swimming carnival was coming up - it was like the third week of high school - the other girls threatened me that if I went I would be drowned,' Kahli told the Daily Mail Australia.

Kahli Brock, 20, said the first four years of high school were the worst of her life as she revealed she received death threats and was constantly bullied

'They kept saying they'd kill me eventually and it stopped me from doing the things I loved.'

From day one, the teen from Iluka, endured severe bullying that would last for four years until she eventually decided to leave.

'On my first day of school I had 12 girls harass me. As soon as I got to school, I was double dacked - undies and all- and stabbed in the back of the nexck with a sharpened paperclip. I'll never forget that day,' Kahli said.

'For four years straight, from year seven to year 10, that was worst time of my life.'

The once sporty and happy child, stopped doing her favourite activities and began to fear going to school each day.

When recalling some of her most traumatic events, the current Curtain University student remembered being trapped in the girls bathroom after being chased by another student who was trying to brand her with a 'smiley' - the shape of the burn mark left on a person's skin after being branded with a hot lighter.

'I was tall - that was one of the reason I was being bullied, and also because I had gap between my teeth,' she said.

Kahli then left Maclean High School to attend Grafton High, a trip which took four hours of public transport each way, before returning to Maclean at the end of year 12 to complete her High School Certificate.

By the time she had returned, she had  straightened her teeth with braces and had already begun modeling, competing in Miss Country Girl Australia in 2010 and being placed in the top eight.

She found attitudes towards her had changed, with one student even writing her a letter of apology for previously harassing her.

The university student who is studying to be a primary school teacher and volunteers at the rural fire fighting brigade, hopes to reach new heights in her modeling career

'As soon as I did modeling they started being nice and wanting to get to know me – I forgive them but I don't forget,' Kahli said.

Now, the university student who is studying to be a primary school teacher and volunteers at the rural fire fighting brigade, hopes to reach new heights in her modeling career.

In November of last year, she came second in the 2013 Gold Coast Swim Fashion competition and signed up to the Katz Model Management agency.
