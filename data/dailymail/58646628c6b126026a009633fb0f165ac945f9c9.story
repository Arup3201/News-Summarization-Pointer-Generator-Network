Father of two Glen Turner was shot a number of times at Croppa Creek on July 29

The family of NSW environment officer Glen Turner who was gunned down in a remote country road have called for jail and confiscation of property in the worst cases where landowners ignore legislation.  

Ian Robert Turnbull, 79, has been charged with murdering the compliance officer at Croppa Creek, north of Moree, on July 29 this year.

He is yet to plead and is currently in custody and is due to appear in court on September 22.

Mr Turnball's NSW property had been at the centre of a land clearing dispute with the Office of Environment and Heritage over illegally chopping down trees in the Croppa Creek area.  He was previously charged and pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court with illegal land clearing between November 2011 and January 2012.

Mr Turnbull, a wheat farmer, had previously been served notices by Mr Turner for illegally clearing vegetation on his property and in the Croppa Creek area. 

As part of the independent Biodiversity Legislation Review the Turner family have submitted an emotional submission calling for legislation to be less ambiguous and 'clear and concise disincentives' for landowners prepared to defy laws.

The review is looking at legislative and policy framework for the management of native vegetation, threatened species and other protected native animals and plants in NSW.

In their submission the family said: 'Our loss is at times unbearable, our need for quiet solace paramount.

'We ask the panel give serious consideration to increasing penalties for non-compliance, given that it has been clearly demonstrated that the current system of penalties does not act as a deterrent. 

'Gaol terms should be a sentencing option. 

'This legislation exists to place controls on those driven solely by self-interest and possessing a skewed idea of their rights as landholders to the detriment of the environment and other landholders.

'No landholder in Australia has an unfettered right to deal with their land as they will.

'We refer in particular to the possibility of landholders being granted permission to cause irreparable damage to land by means of broadscale land clearing, resulting in degradation of water quality, biodiversity, salinity, erosion and loss of our fragile topsoil.'

In a tribute after his death the Turner family said: 'Glen was passionate about his job and made every effort to work positively and constructively with landholders. He was particularly keen that landholders understand their responsibilities under legislation such as the Native Vegetation Act, and was a strong advocate for improved clarity and better education of landholders.

Mr Turner's family said at the time of his death they were devastated by his early passing and would remember him as a loving husband and father to his two young children, aged nine and 10.

'His passing comes at a time when his dreams of the farm and family, which he had planned and lovingly built together with Alison, were coming to fruition,' the statement said: 

'Glen was an accomplished pianist, a gourmet enthusiast and cook, and appreciated a fine wine.

'He always gravitated to the outdoor life and particularly loved taking his kids to the beach, whenever he returned to Port Macquarie - as well as enjoying his quiet time at home with the family and working together with Alison on their property.' 

The family said they were 'appalled' to find a bill put to Parliament on May 29 this year by the Shooters and Fishers Party proposing to reduce maximum penalties for offences including obstructing an authorised officer in the exercise of the officer’s investigative functions'. 

They have called for the review to look at a 'two pronged' approach to make the rules clearer for land owners. 

They want clearer laws on the responsibilities landowners have and 'concise disincentives' for landowners who break the laws. 

The Turners suggest in the worst cases custodial sentences and confiscation of property to be options for landowners who ignore follow-up directions and notices given by compliance officers. 

The independent review panel is expected to report to the government next month with the final reports due out in December.

A spokesman for the Office of Environment and Heritage said: 'The independent Biodiversity Legislation Review Panel is now in the process of considering all submissions received.'
