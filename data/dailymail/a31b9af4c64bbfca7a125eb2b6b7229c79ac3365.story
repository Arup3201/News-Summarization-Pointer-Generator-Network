Despite the non-draconian premise of the guide, the plan promises to 'transform your physique'

If you have tried cutting carbs, banishing sugar or spending hours on the treadmill in the quest for the perfect figure, you will be pleased to hear that a new food and fitness guide says shedding the pounds needn't be such hard work.

The Four-Week Fitness and Food Effect, a collaboration between qualified medical doctor and nutritionist Dr Michelle Storfer and fitnessontoast.com exercise blogger Faya Nilsson, takes the faddiness out of the equation and instead recommends eating carbs, feeling full, drinking caffeine, enjoying hot chocolates and not over-exercising.

Despite the non-draconian premise of the guide, the plan promises to 'transform your physique' in just four weeks, helping you to lose weight, lower your body fat percentage, tone up and feel infused with energy.

And all this without a gym membership or hours on the treadmill. 

'Countless hours of fruitless training can often often drain you of the very energy you're looking to capture,' explains Faya, who has 30,000 followers on her FitnessOnToast Instagram account.  Instagram account. 

Instead Faya recommends body weight training, which uses your own body weight for strength exercises.

'Body-weight training is fantastic for strengthening and sculpting the body,' she says and all you need to start is an exercise resistance band, which retails from £2.  

The 28-day programme also includes 'brutally focused cardio' as well as stretch days and rest days.

In any one week, the  plan recommends three  30-minute body-weight training days, two rest days, one stretch day and one 'hit' day of high-intensity cardiovascular exercise.

A 'hit' involves sprinting for one minute followed by a minute rest for 20-30 minutes. The body-weight circuit consists of five different exercise to be done for one minute each with a two-minute rest at the end, repeated six times.

As well as creating a toned physique, Faya explains, 'an increase in muscle mass will speed up the metabolism even whilst at rest'. 

'The thermogenic effect [increased body heat] that happens after a solid workout will compound this metabolic boost,' she adds. 

Nutritionist Dr Michelle Storfer believes in eating carbs at every meal: 'The elimination of entire food groups, calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure'

The programme also includes a daily meal plan of breakfast, lunch and supper as well as two daily snacks, but Dr Storfer (founder of thefoodeffect.co.uk) has a holistic food philosophy.

She believes in enjoying food and making sure you're never too hungry are essential elements of a healthy eating plan.

'The focus of a diet should not only focus on what to exclude, but more importantly what to include,' she says.

'The elimination of entire food groups, calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure. The end result is inevitable, "When can I come off the diet and eat all the things I miss?"'

She also believes we should eat slowly to enjoy the experience. 'Focus on the food you're eating and don't just wolf it down,' she says.

Dr  Storfer says drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate are good for you

'Don't eat dinner in front of the TV or lunch in front of the computer. Take time out to enjoy your meal and actually pay attention to what you're eating.'

Taking down the pace also helps to prevent over-eating. 'Eating slowly will also ensure your brain registers you've eaten enough food ...before it's too late!' she says.

Carbs at every meal, drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate arealso on teh meal-plan agenda.

'Don't shun carbs but instead stick to wholegrain, unrefined carbs such as oats, whole-grain bread, brown rice, sweet potato and quinoa,' she advises.

'Slow release carbs will give you the get-up-and-go you need to stay active and keep your metabolism burning strong and steady.

'Whilst excess caffeine is obviously no good, caffeine from good quality coffee is packed full of antioxidants and has been shown to have tremendous health benefits,' says Michelle. 'It has also been shown to boost performance when exercising if drunk before a work-out.'

Dark chocolate (with fruit) or a hot chocolate make a regular appearance as an evening snack in the meal plan.

'Stretching, sleeping well and keeping hydrated are also all essential,' she adds. So what are you waiting for? The perfect body is only four weeks away.
