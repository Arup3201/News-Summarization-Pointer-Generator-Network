The suicide rate is skyrocketing in Greece as the economic catastrophe engulfing the nation shows no signs of letting up.

A sun-kissed land with once the lowest recorded suicide rates in Europe, Greece has seen a huge spike in people taking their own lives.

Experts believe that not all suicides are the result of depression; some are ending it all in an act of ultimate political protest.

Greece used to have the lowest recorded suicide rates in Europe. Recently, there has been a spike in people taking their own lives, however

More than 2,500 people have taken their own lives since 2010.

'This is the number for confirmed suicides. We think the real number is much higher,' said psychiatrist Dimitris Boukouras. He mans a psyhiatric hotline that rings off the hook every day.

Greece, which is headed for an autumn bankruptcy unless it does more to reign in spending and release fresh IMF funds worth 40 billion euros, saw 50 deaths and a further 350 suicide attempts in the capital Athens in June alone. Deaths are rising across the country and on the numerous islands that surround Greece.

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras will next week hold his first meetings with euro zone leaders since taking office, striving to assure them he will honour a pledge for more austerity and gauging whether they could grant him more time to pull it off.

Mr Samaras will insist he can ram through an austerity package worth about 11.5 billion euros ($14.2 billion) - a key condition to continue receiving EU/IMF bailout funds and avoid default and a possible exit from the currency club.

Greece has yet to nail down the requested austerity package.

The bulk of the cuts will come from state salaries and pensions, and up to 40,000 public sector firings, further angering an austerity-weary public that often takes to the streets. The coalition's two leftist junior partners have also opposed any further cuts.

Mr Samaras said: 'We're all having a difficult time. There will be more hardship'.

The Greek people have been hit hard by austerity cuts which have led some to take their lives

The first four months of this year saw a surge in the number of suicides among the poor and those older than 65. It has risen by more than 33 percent against the same period for 2011 - 700 people taking their lives since January 1.

Before the financial crisis began, Greece had the lowest suicide rate in Europe at 2.8 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Eurostat.

'Most of the suicides were among members of the middle class and, in many cases, the act itself was carried out in public, almost as if it were a theatrical performance,' commented Germany's Der Spiegel magazine this week.

Rising in tandem is the usage of anti-depressant drugs; up 25 percent on last year in Athens, 18 percent across the country as a whole.

Deaths like that of a 77-year-old pharmacist who shot himself to death on Syntagma Square in downtown Athens in April, and Dimitris Christoulas, who blew his brains out at the same place in the same month, have captured headlines and stoked fears among experts that worse is to come.

People have hanged themselves in public, set alight to themselves in public and died in numerous other ways in the privacy of their own homes.

A note written in red letters on a piece of cardboard are pinned on a memorial to Christoulas in Athens.

They read: 'The government has annihilated all traces for my survival, which was based on a very dignified pension that I alone paid into for 35 years with no help from the state.

'I see no other solution than this dignified end to my life so that I don't find myself fishing through garbage cans for my sustenance.

'I believe that young people with no future will one day take up arms and hang the traitors of this country on Syntagma Square.'

The newspaper Ta Nea describes the mood among Greeks as a 'society on the verge of a nervous breakdown.'

Many Greeks took to the streets to protest against the cuts that have seen many fall into financial hardship

In a bid to offer suffering Greeks some hope, Mr Samaras will use his talks next week to raise a long-standing proposal that the measures be spread over four instead of two years, to soften their impact on a Greek economy enduring its longest and deepest recession since World War Two.

No formal request will be made but the proposal will be broached as part of exploratory talks, an official said.

'The matter of extension is already being debated in Greece and abroad. Its official submission is a different matter'.

Berlin insists that Athens honour its pledges but was open to discussion, Mr Seibert said.

Asked about Greece seeking a two-year austerity extension, he said: 'The chancellor will of course first listen to what Mr Samaras has to say about the situation in Greece and about the implementation of its programme.

'For her, as for the rest of the German government, the agreed memorandum of understanding which sets out what the Greeks must achieve and which remains valid for us, forms the basis for working together with or helping Greece.'

A two-year extension to narrow the budget deficit below 3 per cent of GDP in 2016 instead of 2014 was a key plank of Samaras's campaign for the June 17 election that brought him to power as head of a fragile three-party coalition.

But Samaras and his finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, put the demand on the back burner after meeting EU/IMF inspectors in Athens last month, realising that no concessions would be considered until the lenders were convinced of their commitment to austerity - a big task given repeatedly missed targets and broken promises over the past two years.

They must deliver the 11.5 billion euros before the inspectors return in early September to decide whether to release the next loan tranche and draft a key report that will determine whether the country will be supported or abandoned.
