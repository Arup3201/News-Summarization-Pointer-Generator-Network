A one-day-old Paul Fronczak was abducted from his mother’s arms at Michael Reese Hospital in April 1964 by a woman posing as a nurse.

The
 FBI interviewed hundreds of suspects and examined 10,000 babies in 
their hunt for the infant.

A year later, a boy found abandoned in a stroller on a street corner in
 Newark, New Jersey, was returned to Chester and Dora Fronczak, who were
 told by the FBI that it was their kidnapped son.

The
 agents didn't have much to go on at the time - there was only one 
photograph of the one-day-old Paul before he was kidnapped and 
DNA comparison was not yet available.

However,
 the federal agents drew their conclusion from the fact the New Jersey 
boy's ears looked the same as the snatched Fronczak baby.

It
 was good enough for Chester and Dora. According to news 
reports from the time, Dora Fronczak took one look at the child and 
said: 'That's my baby.'

But 50 years later, DNA tests found that the child the Fronczak couple had raised as their own was not their biological son. 

The story of the infamous kidnapping case, and the subsequent revelations made possible by modern technology, has been widely covered in the media.

Last November, ABC's '20/20' aired a special report focusing on the search for 49-year-old Paul Fronczaks' birth parents - and on the quest to find the family's biological son who vanished without a trace half a century ago.

The episode revived the public’s interest in the cold case, with hundreds of people from around the world calling ABC with tips - among them Johnnie Harbaugh.

The 64-year-old Chicago resident said that he is the son of Linda Taylor, who gained the status of a public enemy after President Reagan mentioned in a speech that she had been accused of committing countless crimes using 100 aliases and 50 fake addresses.

‘My mother was capable of anything. Not only stealing a baby, but she could steal you,’ Harbaugh said in an interview to be aired Saturday on ABC News ‘20/20’. ‘She was just that kind of woman. You know, she done whatever it took for her to survive.’

After being shown a photo of the one-day-old Paul Fronczak, Harbaugh claimed that he saw the baby for the first time when his mother brought him to their house one day in 1964.

Harbaugh recalled that he used to play with the infant, who got the nickname 'Tiger.’

Taylor, who died 12 years ago from a heart attack, was known as a master of disguise. Born Martha Miller or Martha Louise White, the brunette woman with a slightly dark complexion could pass off as Caucasian, Jewish, African-American, Asian or Puerto Rican.

Although Reagan used Taylor's example to illustrate the abuses of the welfare system in the United State, it is generally believed that the scope of her criminal activity was much broader, encompasing assault, theft, bigamy, and possibly even murder.  

According to her son, the woman often described as a 'chameleon' had a room in their home dedicated entirely to her wigs and disguises, including nurse and doctor outfits.

Son's confession: Linda Taylor's son Johnnie Harbaugh, 64, said that one day in 1964, his mother showed up at the house with an infant that looked exactly like Paul Fronczak in his first photographer taken when he was one day old

In 1977, Taylor’s schemes and lies had
 finally caught up with her when she was found guilty of multiple counts
 of welfare fraud and sentenced to two to six years for claiming public 
assistance, Social Security and veteran's benefits  by using fake identities.

It was during the trial that she first became a suspect in the abduction of Paul Fronczak.

According
 to a newspaper report, one of Taylor's ex-husbands said that she showed up one day in the early 60s with a newborn baby boy.

Taylor never admitted to the kidnapping and never faced charges in connection to the Fronczak case.

Speaking
 to ABC, Taylor's son said that he came home from school one day and 
found that the infant dubbed 'Tiger' was gone. His mother offered him no
 explanation regarding his whereabouts.

Looking back on the ordeal, Harbaugh said his mother most likely handed baby Paul to one of her boyfriends from Tennessee.

It
 remains unknown what happened to the man or the child. The FBI told 
ABC's ‘20/20’ that they are looking into Taylor's possible involvement 
in the kidnapping. 

The Paul Fronczak 
found in New Jersey has said that his adoptive parents support his quest
 to discover his identity and find out what happened to their biological
 child.

Ripped from the headlines: The 1964 kidnapping from Paul Fronczak, who was taken from his mother's arms one day after he was born, made international news

As their own: Dora Fronczak reportedly said 'That's my baby' when she saw Paul. Nearly five decades later, it was revealed that Paul belongs to a different family

'I think that the perfect ending would be to find the real Paul, see that he's doing well and then on the same day find my real family. It would also be nice to have an actual birth date that I could believe in, he told the Chicago Tribune.

Chameleon: Born Martha Miller or Martha Louise White, the brunette woman with a somewhat dark complexion could pass off as Caucasian, Jewish, black, Asian or Puerto Rican

The amazing story was the subject of a '20/20' prime-time special with Barbara Walters on ABC last fall. In the wake of the screening, four men put themselves forward as
 possible candidates for being Paul.

One, from Kansa, has offered to participate in a DNA test.

Paul Fronczak told ABC News: 'I would want nothing more than to
 have them be able to meet or at least know what happened to their real 
child before they're gone.'

The news of the mismatched DNA has turned the Fronczak 
family upside down long after the kidnapped was supposedly solved. It 
has also raised a host of chilling, new questions. 

Paul says he has caught himself wondering how old he actually is, why his birth parents abandoned him, what is birth name was.

Chester
 and Dora never told Paul about his turbulent history. He only learned 
about the kidnapping when he found a box of newspaper clippings when he 
got older.

When he confronted his parents they told him, 'You don’t need to see that. You are our son.’

Years
 later, Paul moved from Chicago to Henderson, Nevada, outside Las Vegas.
 He started a family of his own with wife Michelle and daughter Emma.

Life-changing: Paul Fronczak learned from a DNA test that he is not the baby snatched from parents' arms - even though they raised him thinking he was their own son since he was found in New Jersey in 1965

But questions had nagged at him ever since he found the box of newspaper articles. He didn't look Polish and Croatian like his parents. Police at the time had also expressed doubts about whether the boy from Newark was really Paul Fronczak.

They made Chester and Dora go through the adoption process because there was no proof the child was really theirs.

One night, when his parents were visiting from Chicago, Paul bought a drug store DNA kit.

He told KLAS last month: 'I said, "Hey, have you guys ever wondered if I was yours?" You know, making a joke out of it. I said, "Hold on," I went and got the DNA kit, broke it out, and five minutes later, we were swabbing away.'
