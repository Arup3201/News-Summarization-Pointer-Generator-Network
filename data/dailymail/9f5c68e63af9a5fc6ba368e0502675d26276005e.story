Zlatan Ibrahimovic is often heralded as footballing royalty due to his exploits on the pitch - but he came face to face with actual monarchs when he showed the Swedish King and Queen around Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes.

The PSG  striker met King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden on Tuesday to give them a tour of the Ligue 1 champions' stadium.

As well as taking the royal couple on a tour of the ground, Ibrahimovic also introduced them to the club's staff, as well as taking them to meet children from socially-deprived areas of Paris at the PSG foundation.
