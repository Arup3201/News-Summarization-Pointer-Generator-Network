The Duchess of Cambridge is famous for her thrifty approach to fashion and her love of a bargain from Zara but it seems sister Pippa has more exalted tastes.

The author and party planner, 30, was spotted enjoying some retail therapy at the Carolina Herrera boutique in Knightsbridge, where the cheapest item is a pair of £189 sunglasses. Dresses can cost up to £3,194, while bags start at £450.

Despite her expensive purchases, Ms Middleton chose a low-key look for her shopping trip and teamed a simple pair of skinny jeans with flat blue ballet pumps.

A cosy cream jumper, navy cotton jacket and dove grey polka dot scarf kept her warm, while an elegant grey suede tote completed the look.

She also debuted a new shoulder-length hair cut and sported a pair of sunglasses, despite the cloudy weather, as she toured the shops.

She was joined for the trip by a mystery male friend who appeared happy to follow her around the shops, although boyfriend Nico Jackson was nowhere to be seen.

March has been a busy month for Pippa who started it with a romantic trip to the Austrian ski resort of Lech.

Accompanied by 36-year-old stockbroker Jackson, she spent a week in the exclusive resort which is so glamorous, even the lifts are sponsored by Dior and Chanel.

Since then, her career as a columnist for Vanity Fair and the Telegraph has occupied most of her time, with Ms Middleton finding time to create fresh recipes for both.

Her most recent effort, a rocket and mascarpone penne, is apparently a Middleton family favourite and, according to Pippa, just the thing post exercise.
