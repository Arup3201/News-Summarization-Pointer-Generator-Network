A poster advertising a satirical play about the Monarchy and, showing Prince Charles gagged, has been censored by London Underground because it fears it could cause offence.

The advert for the critically acclaimed production of King Charles III features a punk-style portrait of the Prince with his mouth covered by white duct tape.

But despite the fact that the poster has been displayed across London since the play opened nearly three weeks ago, a nervous Transport for London has decided to pixelate Charles’s face.

Posters advertising the play King Charles III at The Almeida Theatre Islington were pixelated by TfL over concerns the punk-style image may cause offence

The original image used for the poster. TfL blamed the company that deals with adverts on the Tube last night for the pixelled image

Last night there appeared to be confusion over exactly why the poster had been censored.

TfL laid the blame on the company that deals with adverts on the Tube, saying the ban was made amid fears that the image might cause offence, but it could not say who it was afraid of offending.

A TfL spokesman said: ‘We work with a company called Exterion Media, which handles our adverts on the Tube network and offers advice.

‘They may say this or that could cause offence. Exterion may have said the poster doesn’t fit with part of their policy.

'The decision was made without reference 
to us and does look to have been a little over-enthusiastic. We will 
speak to them about it.’

A Clarence House aide said no attempt had been made to contact Charles, pictured during a visit to south west London last month, about his image being used

Tom Moloney, of the NB Studio which designed the poster, said the news had come as a shock.

He added: ‘We weren’t aware until we sent the artwork. We sent it off  and it was sent back. All we know is we had to change it in line with their feedback. It was to do with TfL’s rules and regulations about what you are allowed to put up on their sites.’

The Almeida Theatre, in Islington, North London, where the sold-out play  by Mike Bartlett opened  on April 3, still displays a  large uncensored version of  the poster.

A theatre spokesman said: ‘I believe the artwork designers had to pixelate Charles’s face in order for TfL to let us put the posters up.’

Last night, a Clarence House aide said that no attempt had been made to contact Charles about his image being used, nor had the Prince instructed anyone to censor the advert.

The play takes place after the Queen’s death and focuses on the Prince of Wales as he is about to ascend to the throne after ‘a lifetime of waiting’.

Meanwhile, Prince Charles could be crowned as King of an independent Scotland under radical plans backed by SNP leader Alex Salmond.

A separate ceremony would effectively mean Scotland becoming a kingdom in its own right.
