Myles Bradbury, pictured, admitted sexually abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care

Hundreds of child cancer patients may have been molested by a paedophile doctor facing jail last night.

Myles Bradbury, 41, yesterday admitted sexually abusing 18 desperately ill boys under his care at a specialist unit.

But 800 more families have been told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge.

The shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in Colchester and Ipswich – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013.

Police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in Bradbury’s home. In one case he filmed the vile abuse.

Addenbrooke’s has now launched a helpline and is contacting the families of all patients he is thought to have dealt with.

A mother whose child was treated by Bradbury said last night she was tormented by the idea that he may have been abused.

Claire Yeoman’s son Declan was seen by the consultant for leukaemia before his death in November 2012 aged three.

‘It made me feel physically ill,’ said the 39-year-old from Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. 

‘You think: Was your child involved? Could you have noticed anything? Was there anything you missed?

‘You go through every single day of his treatment and basically relive the whole memory of 18 months.’

As Bradbury was warned by a judge he faces a long jail term, it also emerged that:

Police believe Bradbury targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘really poorly’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room.

He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘legitimate examination’.

As he left court, Bradbury said: ‘I’m so sorry’ and refused to answer further questions.

Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: ‘This man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people, but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example, seeing people outside normal consultancy hours.

Up to 800 more families have been told their children could have been at risk during the five years Myles Bradbury worked for Addenbrooke’s Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge 

‘He would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them.

‘What makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination. I wasn’t a case of “Don’t tell your parents”. He was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination.’

Mr Ridgway said there could be many other victims – including some who don’t even realise they were abused.

‘He had extensive experience in the health world at a number of institutions and we are working with them to make sure examinations he conducted were appropriate,’ he added.

Bradbury, from Herringswell, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, and who has separated from his wife, was suspended from Addenbrooke’s last November after a victim’s parents raised concerns with staff.

He was arrested the following month and other families whose children had been abused came forward.

The offences he admitted yesterday were carried out on 18 boys aged eight to 17 between 2009 and 2013.

Dr Keith McNeil, chief executive of Addenbrooke’s, said: ‘Our most abject and sincere apologies go out to any and all of our patients and their families who are affected by this in any way.

‘I am so deeply sorry these incidents have happened and I am also deeply saddened, as a doctor, that one of my own profession has placed himself and his patients in this position.

‘There is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients and, quite frankly, it sickens me to think that trust has been breached.’

Chief nurse Ann-Marie Ingle said: ‘His cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all, including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable and sick children.

Claire Yeoman is among the many parents who are terrified that their children may have been abused by Myles Bradbury.

Her son Declan was treated by the disgraced doctor from May 2011, when he was diagnosed with leukaemia, until his death in November 2012, when he was three.

Miss Yeoman, 39, from Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, knew nothing about the police investigation until Addenbrooke’s Hospital contacted her days before his first court appearance.

Declan did not feature in the investigation or prosecution in the end, but Miss Yeoman said last night: ‘I would see Myles on a regular basis, almost every day. He had almost become part of the family.

‘We had every bit of trust in him. Myles, we thought, was a good doctor. But he had a very dark secret he was hiding from the parents.

‘I think that makes it even harder to swallow – the fact he was hiding it from all of us who trusted him.’

The parents of one of the doctor’s alleged victims, who has leukaemia, told the Daily Mail they felt ‘betrayed and numb’.

The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ‘I’m kicking myself because I never thought to say why is there no one else in the room? But we never queried it because of his position.’

‘As soon as we were alerted, we took immediate action to suspend him from clinical practice.’

Bradbury admitted 25 offences against 18 victims and pleaded guilty to making the 16,000 indecent images.

He was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date.

Bradbury has been suspended by the General Medical Council and will face a fitness to practise hearing at which he is expected to be struck off.

The consultant specialised in treating childhood cancers of the blood including leukaemia and lymphoma as well as rare blood disorders. Patients were referred to him from across East Anglia.

Before taking up this post he spent four years working his way up from a middle ranking doctor to consultant at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, from 2004 to 2007. He has helped train young doctors as well.
