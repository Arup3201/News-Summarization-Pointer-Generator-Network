After getting her big break on the cover
 of Italian Vogue in 2011 as part of a special 'curvy cover', Robyn Lawley has
 become a body image advocate.

Her latest modelling gig sees her fronting Evans' SS14 campaign, Live Unlimited, which encourages women to embrace 'fashionable pieces that are not limited by size'.

The high street giant says she's the perfect model because she showcases the collection in an aspirational way, while proving that her shape doesn’t restrict how amazing clothes can look on a bigger frame.

New face: Robyn Lawley has been unveiled as the new face of Evans's Live Unlimited SS14 range (Lime trimmed tunic dress, £50)

The Arcadia-owned store's new range is full of on-trend 
print tunics and kimono-shaped dresses, as well as slouchy sequinned waistcoats and studded cardis.

The range, which is available in sizes 14-28, is full of uplifting limes 
and corals, as well as classic monochrome tones.

The store say that the cut and shape of each design has been taken into consideration 
to create a sophisticated range that will work all the way through the 
summer. 

As well as her modelling duties, Robyn, 24, also runs a popular food blog 'Robyn Lawley Eats'.

Robyn, who 
continues to advocate for more recognition of bigger women within the fashion industry, is 
out to prove that you can still indulge while following a healthy eating
 plan.

Seasonal shift: The new range is full of on-trend print tunics and kimono shaped dresses, available in size 14-28 (Paisley print kaftan top, £55, black straight leg trousers, £50)

She regularly posts snaps of the decadent desserts and calorie-laden 
dishes she prepares.

The Australian model is even launching her own cookbook in 2015.

In
 the last few weeks, the size
 12 model has shared images of a carb-filled white roll oozing with melted 
cheese, her take on a Greek spanakopita filled with feta and an apple 
strudel with home-made vanilla ice cream.

On-trend: The store, owned by Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, hopes to add some sophistication to women's wardrobes this Spring (Animal print tunic, £50, natural animal print back cardigan, £60)

But it 
isn't all sweets and rich foods, 
Robyn also shares pictures of the healthy meals she enjoys, most 
recently a plate of sashimi.

Robyn recently revealed that when she
 first moved to New York to pursue modeling in 2010, beauty companies 
rejected her for being 'too big'.

The Aussie model, who starred on the March cover of Australia's Cosmopolitan magazine, said that she was initially disheartened after she left her Sydney hometown.

'We'd send beauty companies pictures of 
me, and they'd reply saying don’t ever send us "plus-size" models,' she explained.

However, after landing
 the cover of 
Italian Vogue and French Elle in 2011 and then a Ralph Lauren campaign 
in 2012, she said the industry is slowly becoming more accepting of 
models that don't fit into the size zero ideal.

'The 
industry was different back then. Now everyone’s nicer; they’ve realised
it works better,' said Robyn, who is currently taking silversmith lessons while also DJing.

It was negative attitudes to her size 
that forced Robyn to take a hiatus from modelling at 17.

'After I quit I moved 
overseas for a gap year. When I came back, that’s when I gave it another
go, because I’d found out about "plus-size" models,' she said, adding that it's a term she isn't a fan of.

'It puts women down and it 
puts a label on them,' she said. 

In 
a recent interview with Clique magazine, the six-foot-two-inch brunette emphasised 
her bemusement at being considered 'plus-size' - despite being the owner of a toned, healthy body.

'People
think plus-size models don't exercise - we do!' she told the magazine. 'But it's 
about health, not forcing my body to be something it's not meant to be.'

Foodie: The Aussie model writes a food blog and is even preparing to launch her very own cookbook in 2015

Calorie-laden treats: Robyn has shared images of
 a carb-filled white roll oozing with melted cheese,  an apple strudel teamed with home made
 vanilla ice cream, a burger and a Greek spanakopita filled with feta

She
 admitted that as a teenager she tried to slim down to satisfy the 
demands of mainstream modeling, but said that even though she was 
starving herself, achieving size zero proved impossible.

'Even at my lightest, I just couldn't get
there,' she explained. 'I genuinely really tried. I was counting 
calories, I was taking diet pills, I was dabbling in starvation.

'I thought you had to be skinny to be beautiful. And I thought I would never be beautiful at this size.'

Who's laughing now? Robyn recently revealed that when she first moved to New York to pursue modeling in 2010, beauty companies rejected her for being 'too big' but she is now one of the most sought-after models

Since
 giving calorie-counting the boot, Robyn has shot to fame and has 
followed in the footsteps of fellow high-profile models, Crystal Renn 
and Sophie Dahl - both of whom are as much admired for their curves as 
they are for their beauty.

Although she was recently signed by Mango to 
front its new plus-size range, Violetta, which starts at a size 12, Robyn is irritated that the industry 
continues to see her as only catering to a 'niche' market.

'People say, "How is she a plus-size model?" and I'm like, "Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?" she said.
