One of Britain’s biggest rural police forces will run out of cash to fight crime and protect the public within three years, its chief constable has warned.

Neil Rhodes claimed Lincolnshire Police will effectively go out of business if the latest round of cuts takes place.

He said the force would be ‘unsustainable’ by 2018, with a shortfall of £10.4million, meaning a fifth of frontline officers would have to be axed.

In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, he said he would have to scrap neighbourhood policing, with bobbies on the beat replaced by ‘just a few’ community support officers.

Response times to 999 calls would rise and the ‘range of offences where a meaningful investigation will be possible will reduce’, Mr Rhodes added.

Crimes such as theft would have to be largely ignored, and investigations into historic sex abuse and cyber-crime could not be pursued. The officer, who has more than 28 years’ experience, said he would not have spare staff to help at major events or emergencies outside his area.

‘If we were a business, then it would be being funded at below the cost of being in business,’ he said. ‘The cupboard is bare and it is likely that we will be the first force in the country to fall over.’

Last month Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary warned the ability of six forces, including Lincolnshire, Dorset and Suffolk, to provide an effective service would be at risk after cuts left a ‘very thin blue line’.

Lincolnshire Police is particularly vulnerable as it covers the third largest area in England and Wales – 2,292 square miles – and has one of the smallest forces, due to the county’s few cities and relatively low population. 

Support: Mr Rhodes also said his officers would no longer be able to travel the country to support others during major events or emergencies, such as the Olympics or London riots

It has the third highest number of crimes per officer. The force has already cut 1,220 officers to 1,100, but Mr Rhodes said a further 236 frontline staff would have to go.

Lincolnshire Police has been criticised in the past for the way it spends money. In 2008 bonuses of £40,000 were shared between three chiefs when the force was rated one of the worst in the country. Blundering officers who put the wrong fuel into police cars ran up a £10,000 repair bill in 2009. And in May this year, the Police Federation attacked the force’s plan to spend £600,000 recruiting 1,000 ‘volunteers’, saying the cash would be better spent hiring 25 frontline officers.

But Mr Rhodes claims costs have already been reduced by collaborating with other forces and outsourcing non-frontline roles to private firms such as G4S. ‘In 2016-17 Lincolnshire Police will be … on the edge of viability,’ he wrote.

‘In the following year it will be unsustainable. To cut officer numbers by the amount needed would … compromise both public safety and officer safety.’

Last year, HMIC said it had ‘concerns’ about the force’s ability to maintain services after ‘significant’ budget cuts from 2015/16 with ‘one of the lowest spends on policing, small workforce numbers, low costs and limited further opportunities for economies of scale.’

Yesterday Alan Hardwick, the area’s police and crime commissioner, said: ‘My chief constable tells me that on an average Saturday night at 11pm, he has only 18 constables available to deploy in the city of Lincoln, and only ten in Boston.’

The Government announced a 20 per cent cut in police funding in 2010. The number of officers fell from 141,600 at the general election to 125,400 in March.
