Christopher Barlow, 22, has been jailed for 12 years after he pleaded guilty to rape and two charges of assault with intent to commit rape at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Thursday

A 22-year-old who raped a woman at knifepoint and forced her to perform a sex act before throwing a 50p coin at her feet,  has been jailed for 12 years.

Christopher Barlow attacked the victim as she walked home from Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and attempted to rape two other women over a four week period.

He took the woman to Northwood Park in January this year where he pushed a knife towards her face, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard.

She vomited at the end of the ordeal and said Barlow threw the 50p coin at her feet.

The warehouse worker from Birches Head, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to rape and two charges of assault with intent to commit rape.

Judge David Fletcher said: 'You pose a high risk of serious harm to the public, specifically females.

'You were growing in confidence as you continued to commit these offences.

'You utilised a weapon on three occasions and targeted lone females who were vulnerable.

'Had you not been disturbed you would have in all likelihood gone on to rape the third victim.'

He was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order.

Weeks earlier, Barlow had approached another woman with a knife in Hanley, and told her: 'Do what I say, or face the consequences.'

He told the woman to perform a sex act on him or he would stab her, but she managed to run to a taxi and get away.

Barlow also grabbed hold of another woman in February and tried to rape her at Central Forest Park, Hanley.

But the victim was saved when a couple in a car saw him trying to bundle her into a park and used their car headlights and horn to scare him away and he fled.

The couple dialled 999 and police found Barlow hiding in a park. When officers seized his phone they discovered he had searched for 'forced sex' on the internet.

Barlow's DNA was matched to samples taken from the woman in the January rape and all three victims identified him during an identity parade.

Anis Ali, defending, said Barlow was making positive changes to his life.

Speaking after the sentence, Detective Sergeant Lindon Evans, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'We are glad Barlow is off the streets.

'There is no doubt the couple in the car potentially prevented a second rape.

'These three women have suffered shocking, terrible ordeals. Thankfully this type of offence is rare.'
