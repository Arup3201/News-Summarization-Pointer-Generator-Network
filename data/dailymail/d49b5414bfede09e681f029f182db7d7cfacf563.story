Axed Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison has been charged over a nightclub fracas which left an 18-year-old student with a facial injury millimetres from her eye.

The brunette, who was suspended from the MTV reality show after her arrest in July, will appear before magistrates next month.

It is claimed she was involved in a brawl in a bar in Newcastle city centre which left student and model Hannah Kelso needing stitches to her face.

Witnesses to the incident - in which Hannah was reportedly struck with a stilleto heel - said it unfolded with a TV crew for the reality series in tow.

The student was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary after the incident on July 3.

Vicky, 25, was initially arrested alongside Geordie Show co-star Holly Hagan after the incident in Florita's Bar, in Newcastle city centre.

Holly, 20, from Thornaby-on-Tees, was later cleared but police have charged Vicky with common assault, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The offences would hold a maximum sentence of five years in prison if she was convicted.

The show launched in 2011 after the success of 'staged reality' shows like the Only Way Is Essex in the UK and Jersey Shore in the U.S.

It is known for its flamboyant characters who the show has followed across the world from Newcastle - including to Amsterdam and Sydney.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Vicky Pattison has been charged with common assault, affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and will appear at Newcastle Magistrates Court on December 19.'
