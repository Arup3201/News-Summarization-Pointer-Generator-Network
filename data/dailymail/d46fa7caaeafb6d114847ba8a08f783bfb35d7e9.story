A college freshman is in shock after discovering his mother and older brother shot dead in the family home and his father missing.

University of Texas Austin student Teodore 'Teo' Matase, 17, found the bodies of Emilia Matase, 47, and Emanuel Matase, 26, in pools of blood in separate parts of the family's two-story Cypress, Texas home last Thursday.

'It doesn't seem real,' he said. 'I'm not going to be able to like talk to my mom again or my brother, and it's so weird to think how final that is.'

Shock: University of Texas Austin student Teodore 'Teo' Matase, 17, pictured, discovered the bodies of his mom, Emilia Matase, 47, and brother, Emanuel Matase, 26, in pools of blood Thursday

Missing: His mother, right, was shot multiple times, and his father, Camil Matase, was missing. He has reportedly been spotted since in his native Romania

His father, Camil Matase, was nowhere to be found, but has been spotted in his native Romania since the murders, according to KHOU.com.

Harris County Sheriff's office said the bodies were discovered after a welfare check was requested by relatives who said they hadn't heard from the mother and son in a while.

The son's body was found upstairs in a study and the mother's body in a downstairs bedroom.

Police did not immediately say if the victims were shot, stabbed or beaten to death, but they confirmed there was a lot of blood in the home. Later, they revealed Mrs Matase had been shot several times and her son was shot in the head.

Brother: Emanuel Matase, 26, pictured right with Teo, was shot in the head

Depression: Friends said the father-of-two, Camil Matase, pictured, may have suffered from depression

Authorities have ruled out a murder-suicide.

There was no note left, and the only thing missing was Mr Matase, police said. They believe the bodies had been at the home for a couple of days before they were found.

'I don't know motive, but we're looking for the husband to talk to him and find out, in fact, if he is safe himself,' said Sgt. Felipe Rivera.

Rivera said the killer or killers knew the family well and had access to the home, because there was no sign of forced entry. Mr Matase is not currently a suspect, merely a person of interest, he said.

Father: Police are continuing their investigation but want to speak to Teo Matase's father

Friends said the father-of-two may have suffered from depression.

The shocking slaying stunned neighbors.

'I didn't hear any commotion with the dogs or anything; (I'm) so shocked,' Rochelle Abram told KHOU.com.

'They moved in about a year and a half ago. I know there's a mother and a son. I've watched them cut their grass and just say "Hi" in passing when we walk the dogs and stuff.'

Tragic: 'It doesn't seem real,' Teo, right, said. 'I'm not going to be able to like talk to my mom again or my brother, and it's so weird to think how final that is'
