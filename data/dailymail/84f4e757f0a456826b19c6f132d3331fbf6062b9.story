The American infant mortality rate has dropped just slightly to 6.14 deaths per 1,000 births, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control.

The new figure, released by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, comes from an analysis of data from the most recent statistics from 2010 and though it does mark a decrease it is only a small one.

The infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6.39 deaths per 1,000 children, meaning that the number dropped by just 4 per cent over that year span.

Infant mortality rates are used for measuring a country's prosperity and the nation's overall health.

Slowly decreasing: The infant mortality rate has not been released for 2011 yet, but it is expected to be down to 6.05 per cent, from 6.14 in 2010 and 6.39 in 2009

In that vein, the 6.14 figure is not a good sign for the U.S. as it places the sole remaining superpower as one of the lowest of the world's wealthiest nations.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development analyzes global health statistics and noted that the average infant mortality rate is only 4 deaths per 1,000 births. 

NBC News reported that Iceland held one of the lowest rankings with only 1.6 deaths per 1,000 while Japan, Sweden and Finland came in shortly after with 2 deaths.

According to the OECD report, the US was ranked number 26 out of 34 wealthy countries, which is a statistic that has analysts worried.

'While life expectancy in the United States used to be one year above the OECD average in 1970, it is now more than one year below the average,' the report stated.

Birth defects and low birth weight- which was cited as connected to young mothers- were named as the main causes of America's relatively low ranking.

Still not stellar: The infant mortality rate in the United States is still higher than that of many other wealthy countries, as their average is 4 per cent and the US is still more than 2 percentage points higher. The US looks like it is ranked more favorably in this graphic because it looks at all countries- wealthy and poor- which boosts up the US

'In reality, women with one risk 
factor often have other risk factors as well,' a report by Save the 
Children concluded when it was released in April.

'For
 example, teenage mothers are more likely to be unmarried and of a 
low-income status; mothers who do not receive prenatal care are more 
likely to be of a low-income status and uninsured.'

Causes: Premature births are the main cause for infant mortality in the US which often causes birth defects and low birth weight

Multiple births also play a factor as the infant mortality rate for triplets is ten times the rate for single births.

At least one of those problems may be fixed in coming years, as Danish food ingredients maker Chr Hansen is in discussions with companies over using probiotic bacteria to reduce the risk of a deadly stomach disease among premature babies.

An independent study by the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne has shown that daily intake of a mix of three of Chr Hansen's probiotic strains more than halved the risk among premature babies of developing necrotizing enterocolitis compared with infants that received a placebo.

The study was conducted on 1,100 children.

'We are in dialogue with potential customers about products which addresses NEC directly,' Christian Barker, Executive Vice President of Chr Hansen's Health & Nutrition Division, told Reuters.

He declined to reveal which companies are involved in the talks.

Chr Hansen makes cultures, colors and enzymes and has food producers like Danone and Nestle as major customers.
