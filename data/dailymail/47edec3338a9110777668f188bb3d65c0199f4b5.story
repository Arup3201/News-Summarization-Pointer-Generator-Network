A government investigation has exposed Australia's biggest welfare scammers in a long-running crackdown that recovered more than a billion dollars in payments last year, with more expected in 2014.

The scammers have been caught red-handed in footage shown on A Current Affair.

But there's more to come, and each will now face the legal consequences of their actions, warns the Department of Human Services.

One in four Australian families now receive some form of welfare.

With dozens of benefits available and billions of dollars being handed out, some are claiming welfare they're not entitled to.

While it may just be a few hundred dollars a week - that money can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars being scammed from taxpayers.

In 2013, the Australian Government spent $132 billion on welfare - that's $250,000 every minute.

Treasurer Joe Hockey warned, when handing down his first Federal Budget, that the government 'cannot maintain current levels of expenditure' - making it more important than ever to crack down on those defrauding Centrelink.

With the help of new technology, Human Services workers are starting to catch these rorters on camera.

Last year, Centrelink recovered $1.15 billion worth of outstanding debts and investigated 3,200 people.

Of the money recovered and those investigated, $39 million were fraudulent claims and 1,200 were prosecuted.

In one instance, a 43-year-old was jailed for claiming parenting payments under a false identity.

Another example is Richard Bruce, who was among the 800,000 Australians on a disability pension, claiming he was too sick to work.

But while he was claiming disability benefits, he was practising his swing down at the golf club.

But what's worse is people claiming the benefits of deceased relatives.

Claiming her dead sister's welfare payments: This woman netted $177,000 in fraudulent welfare payments over 20 years

One 50-year-old woman continued to withdraw her deceased mother's Age Pension, long after she had died.

Another woman claimed the benefits of her dead sister for 20 years - stealing $177,000 from Australian taxpayers.

'Those cases where people continue to receive payment of deceased relatives are pretty low acts to be honest with you,' Department of Human Services General Manager Hank Jongen admits.

'They demonstrate to us that someone has deliberately set out to rip off the taxpayer.'

Sydney Uniting Church minister Reverend Bill Crews, who hosts a weekly program on radio station 2GB and founded youth-services charity the Exodus Foundation, said he believes some people are rorting the system out of sheer desperation.

'You're trying to live on a welfare benefit and you're struggling and you're behind and you owe money everywhere and you have a credit card and it's maxed out and you've borrowed all the money from Centrelink and somehow two or three hundred dollars falls in your lap what are you going to do?' he asked.

But his view isn't shared by all.

Melbourne radio broadcaster Neil Mitchell says he was furious to learn of the scams - and has no sympathy for those scamming the system.

'It's selfish, it's greedy, it's fraudulent,' Mr Mitchell said.
