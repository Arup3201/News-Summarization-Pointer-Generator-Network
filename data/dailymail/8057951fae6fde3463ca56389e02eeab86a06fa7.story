He is one of the most photographed teenagers in the world but it appears it still doesn't take much to impersonate Justin Bieber.

With a pair of sunglasses, a hoody, some fake tattoos and a few bodyguards, 16-year-old Jeremy Frost managed to convince die-hard Bieber fans he was the real deal.

A hoard of delighted, screaming girls can be seen posing up for pictures and hugging the imposter in a clip uploaded to YouTube which has already been viewed more than 440,000 times.

Jeremy, who has been told he resembles the pop singer, decided to pull the prank with the help of his friend and brother, who have their own YouTube channel called Three Amigos Comedy, to see what sort of reaction he received.

Hours before the real Justin Bieber, 19, was due to perform in Boston, Jeremy went on a tour of the city complete with fake paparazzi and bodyguards.

To make sure he looked the part, he wore Bieber's typical outfit of a baseball cap, white hoody, baggy jeans and lots of bling.

Delighted Bieber fans couldn't believe their luck and happily posed for photos, asked him for autographs, hugs and kisses, with no idea they weren't meeting the famous teen.

YouTube viewers congratulated Jeremy and his friends on a 'hilarious' video.

Convincing: Delighted fans asked for Jeremy's autograph and to have their picture taken with him

Criticism: But while many viewers thought the video was funny, some said it was cruel to let fans believe they'd had actually met the star

But some Bieber fans weren't quite so happy.

Ellie Belieber wrote: 'Congratulations. you made all those girls believe they saw Justin. OMG. no respect or what?'

Others suggested it was easy to tell it wasn't the real Justin Bieber because 'the real justin would just spit on his fans', referring to the stars recent 'pop brat' behaviour.

He has been pictured spitting on fans and urinating in a janitor's mop bucket in the kitchen of a New York night club.

But Jeremy and his team kept their fake Bieber tour around Boston strictly professional.
