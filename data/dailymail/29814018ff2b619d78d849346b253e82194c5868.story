The head of a celebrity rehab centre which treated Amy Winehouse has been accused of falsely claiming to be a doctor.

Brendan Quinn, a former nurse, co-founded the Causeway Retreat, an addiction clinic based in a remote manor house on Osea Island off the coast of Essex in 2005.

The £10,000-a-week centre also treated Take That's Mark Owen and actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

But it was closed in 2010 after being refused registration by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Quinn now faces a string of misconduct charges including pretending to be a doctor and leaving drugs in a suitcase in an unlocked room.

The firm behind the clinic, 27 Management, was taken to court at the time and admitted running an unregistered service and the judge said its standards 'would really shame a Third World country'.

The Causeway Retreat housed mainly alcohol and drug addicts but also took in patients with mental health problems.

Quinn face a misconduct hearing in March to answer ten allegations relating to the management of the centre.

The Nurse and Midwifery Council has 
accused him of falsely claiming to be a doctor in advertising material and in one case directly to a patient's relative.

It is alleged he failed to register the 
clinic with the relevant authorities and allowed mentally ill clients 
to be treated despite being warned not to.

He
is also accused of allowing clients to be admitted without ensuring 
that an adequate psychiatric assessment taken place, that a 
doctor was always at the site or that patients were adequately supervised and had adequate after care.

It also alleged that drugs were stored on site in a suitcase in an unlocked room.

At a hearing last year Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, denied the allegations and is currently subject to an interim conditions of practice order.

A full NMC hearing starts on March 13 and is expected to run over seven days.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
