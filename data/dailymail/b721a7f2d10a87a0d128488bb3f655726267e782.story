A pregnant mother-of-11 who split with her husband after he struck up an online relationship with another woman has taken him back – and wants even more children with him.

Cheryl Prudham, who gets £39,000 a year in handouts from the taxpayer, said: ‘We’re good at making babies.

‘I’ve asked Robert to have his vasectomy reversed because being apart made me realise I want more children.

‘And I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’

Broody: Cheryl Prudham, who is five months pregnant with her 12th child, has rekindled the love with husband Robert - and they're planning on expanding their brood even more by reversing his vasectomy

Last month Mrs Prudham, 32, said that Robert – the father of her five youngest children – had left her on several occasions for other women during their six years together.

His most recent indiscretion was sending indecent messages to a woman on Facebook. His wife vowed just three weeks ago to never forgive him.

But after she spoke out on her plight as a single mother, the couple are back together and planning children 13 and 14 – because 13 is an ‘unlucky’ number.

Mrs Prudham says her 29-year-old husband has sworn to her that he is a changed man, and that they want to renew their wedding vows.

They plan to hold the ceremony after Mrs Prudham gives birth in July. The couple have been told the baby is a girl.

In her latest interview, Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine: ‘Robert said he’s sorry and we ended up in bed together because we love each other.

‘He has admitted to sleeping around in the past but he said this time he had only been messaging a woman on Facebook.

‘I believe him – he broke down and cried... he’s never done that before. I’m not making excuses but he tends to cheat when I’m pregnant. I don’t really want sex as much then as I just feel fat.’

The Prudhams, from Gravesend, Kent, have previously caused public outrage because of the huge sums they get from the Government for their ever-expanding brood.

The family claim £39,192 a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000.

They have managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year benefits cap because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit.

They live in a five-bedroom semi-detached council house but are on the waiting list for a seven-bedroom home because their current accommodation is ‘too cramped’.

The Prudhams have been looking into vasectomy reversals on the NHS but have determined they will have to cough up £2,000 to have the procedure carried out privately. Mrs Prudham said: ‘It will be worth every penny.’

She had her first son, George, when she was 17 and living in a homeless hostel. She moved into a flat with her then boyfriend and had another son and a daughter. Three unplanned pregnancies followed, before she met Mr Prudham in March 2009.

Within months of their first date, they were engaged and she was pregnant. But two weeks before their wedding, he cheated for the first time.

The wedding went ahead when Mrs Prudham was eight months pregnant.

She said last month: ‘I was desperate to have a more stable family life and give the kids a home with a mum and a dad – something I’d never had but always craved.’

But six months after saying their vows, she claims Mr Prudham walked out, telling her he needed space. He returned three weeks later.

Mrs Prudham said: ‘My friends think I’m mad but Katie Price [the former glamour model] took back her husband after he cheated.’
