Heartless bureaucrats in Germany are threatening to destroy a comatose boy's pet dog who has become his chief 'carer' for the past six years.

Every morning, Tascha the Staffordshire Bull Terrier comes into ten-year-old Dylan Gerzmehle's room and pulls back his blanket with her teeth.

She then licks his feet and snuggles up to his face and remains by his side all day.

'A bond that should never be broken': German authorities are threatening to destroy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who has been 'caring' for comatose boy Dylan Gerzmehle for the last six years after it bit a neighbour's dog

Devoted: Every morning, Tascha comes into Dylan's room, snuggles up to him and remains by his side all day

Complex machines monitoring his breathing and his heart record how both improve when she is present.

Dylan’s parents Eckhard and Barbara say they have a bond that should never be broken - and Dylan’s doctors agree.

But Tascha is a breed classified as a fighting dog in the state of Brandenburg near Berlin where Dylan lives. And she bit a neighbour’s dog last month in a kerbside scrap.

This, say authorities, means she must move out - or be destroyed.

Germans, usually passive in the face of an overarching state bureaucracy, have mobilised in their thousands to keep Dylan and Tascha together.

Dangerous breed: Brandenburg state had turned a blind eye to a law banning Staffordshire Bull Terriers, but it is now ordering Tascha to be relocated or be destroyed

Already over 94,000 people have signed a petition on the social networking site Facebook and protestors are vowing to protest to Chancellor Angela Merkel if boy and dog are parted.

'Whenever the dog is with him, our son responds. He is happy,' says Eckhard, 59.

'His breathing becomes quieter, his heart rate falls. That could only be because of this dog.'  

Dylan was born into a vegetative state but his condition improved since Tascha arrived as a puppy six years ago.

The family moved to the small town of Schonwalde in Brandenburg from Berlin to give Dylan more peaceful surroundings.

But unlike Berlin, Brandenburg has a dangerous dog breed law that does not permit Staffordshire Terriers.

Until recently, the district had not objected to Tascha as she has been neutered, properly reported and has received training from certified dog trainers. She also has passed temperament tests.

But due to her dogfight with involving the neighbour’s pet the authorities are now enforcing the law. 

The Erna Graff Animal Welfare Foundation said the fight wasn’t even started by Tascha.

Nonetheless,
 the Gerzmehles paid for the veterinary treatment for the injured dog 
and apologised for what happened. The dog is expected to fully recover 
from his injuries.

Outrage: More than 94,000 people have signed a petition on Facebook demanding the decision be reversed

But the family have been told that Tascha must move on or die.

The Erna-Graff-Foundation is supporting the family legally, stating: 'If necessary, we will bring this matter before the Federal Constitutional Court' - the highest in Germany.

Dylan's doctor also has spoken out for Dylan, saying the dog acts as a therapy dog for the critically ill boy and 'strongly advises' against taking Tascha away from him.

'We could really use the support of the authorities,' said Eckhard. 

'We must keep Tascha for Dylan’s sake, for every little spark of happiness that she brings to him.'

Town mayor Bodo Oehme said: 'My hands are tied. The case is clear: the dog bit another. 

'What happens if he was to bite a person, or the child himself?'

But a glimmer of hope is on the horizon: the parents are scheduled for a meeting with the mayor and other officials next week in the wake of the firestorm of protest.

The mayor’s office said that if the parents can prove Tascha is a 'therapy dog', they will 'try to find a solution to this problem.'

Eckhard, 49, said: 'They have already been around several times trying to take her away to kill her. I will believe it when I see it. But it is a hopeful sign.'
