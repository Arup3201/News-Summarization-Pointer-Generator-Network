Nokia set the bar pretty high with its 41MP pro Lumia phone camera, but now a new detachable lens makes it possible for other smartphone users to take professional-looking pictures with their humble handset.

The Olloclip attachment comes with four lenses that create a range of photo effects including fisheye and wide-angle, plus 10x and 15x macro zoom.

Each lens can be used interchangeably, simply by screwing them on and off, and the whole system costs £69.99.

Size: 1.5" x 1" x 1"

Weight: 0.8 oz

Compatibility: iPhone 4/4s, 5/5s

Colours: Black, silver, red

Lenses: Fisheye lens has 180-degree field-of-view

Wide-angle lens doubles the iPhone's normal field of view

First macro lens gives 10X magnification with a 18mm focus distance

The 15x macro lens has 12mm focus distance

Recent research from Pew found that 82 per cent of smartphone owners use their handsets to take pictures.

Most high-end phones now feature between 5MP and 8MP cameras as standard, with a range of editing tools and settings.

Nokia's Lumia 1020 even comes with a professional-quality 41MP camera with advanced white balance, exposure and zoom features.

Olloclip's four quick-change lenses are similar to those available with larger DSLR cameras and work in photo and video modes.

The macro lenses are built into the attachment, which can be flipped over depending on the level of zoom required and whether a user wants to use the front - or rear-facing camera on their phone.

The fisheye and wide-angle lenses can
then be screwed to either side of the attachment.

The whole system 
uses 'enhanced optic technology' to make full use of the camera's 
default megapixels.

Olloclip is made of aluminimum and has been designed to take photos that are 'edge-to-edge' with less lens distortion than traditional or basic lenses.

The left-hand image was taken using Olloclip's fisheye lens, which has a 180-degree field-of-view. The right-hand image was taken using the 10x macro lens and 18mm focus distance

The 10x macro lens additionally has a focus distance of around 18mm, which increases the amount of light in a photo and improves the depth of field.

'We wanted to enhance the new features of the iPhone 5s camera, while also complementing the iPhone's aesthetic look,' said Patrick O'Neill, founder and president of Olloclip.

'We believe we've succeeded in creating a pocket-sized product that any iPhone user will be proud of and that any iPhone photographer will be inspired to use to create great art.'

Olloclip can be pre-ordered for £69.99 and is due to be shipped in November.
