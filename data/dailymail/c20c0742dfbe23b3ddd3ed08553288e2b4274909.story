It really does take a very good goalkeeper to eclipse Thibaut Courtois and Costa Rica have that very man. Levante’s Keylor Navas was voted the best stopper in Spain last season and last night he proved to the world precisely why, with a series of thrilling saves capped by heroics in the penalty shoot-out.

Backed by five nerveless spot-kicks from his team-mates, Navas ensured his tiny Central American nation will take part in their first ever World Cup quarter-final, despite playing for nearly an hour with 10 men against Greece.

They responded to misery having been seconds from victory before Sokratis Papastathopoulos appeared unmarked to keep the Greeks in the competition with a stoppage time goal which wiped out the opener scored by Bryan Ruiz.

Greece seemed sure to win from this point but Costa Rica dug in, rode their luck it has to be said, relied on their magnificent goalkeeper and won it on penalties.

Theofanis Gekas, once of Portsmouth, 
was the only player to miss from nine in the shoot-out and what a 
fabulous save it was by Navas, springing to his right to throw up a hand
 and keep out a solid strike.

Michael
 Umana converted the next one and Costa Rica were off, celebrating with 
what energy they had left. They have secured a date with Holland in 
Salvador on Friday, although it’s hard to imagine the Dutch are quaking 
in their clogs.

The spirit 
of Jorge Luis Pinto’s team is far higher than its quality and it will 
take some time to get over the draining emotion and the muscle sapping 
effects of 120 minutes in Recife’s heat and humidity. They will also be 
without defender Oscar Duarte in the quarter-final after his red card.

All
 this drama seemed highly unlikely at the end of an excruciatingly dull 
first-half when the crowd in Recife, which was far from capacity, made 
their feelings known by whistling and jeering the teams into the break.

It
 had been 45 minutes devoid of incident but for an excellent save by 
Navas to thwart Dimitrios Salpingidis. In darted Salpingidis from the 
right to connect with a splendid cross on the run by left-back Jose 
Cholevas, but Navas spread his body and deflected the effort wide with 
his right leg.

Georgios 
Samaras planted a free header straight at the Costa Rica ‘keeper in the 
second-half before Greece went behind to the goal from Ruiz, which 
seemed like a miskick, seven minutes after the interval.

It
 may have been that the talented Ruiz had simply applied incredible 
deception to his shot, shaping to curl it inside one post with his left 
foot while rolling it into the opposite corner of the net, after Joel 
Campbell’s foraging on the left and a pass from Christian Bolanos.

From
 here, the tie exploded. Costa Rica were denied a penalty moments later 
when Vasileios Torosidis clearly handled a right-wing cross heading 
towards Bolanos. The officials missed it and substitute goalkeeper Oscar
 Granados was shown a yellow card for being the most vociferous of many 
complaining from the bench.

Pinto’s
 team were reduced to 10 when Duarte was sent off after receiving his 
second caution of the night for his second clumsy challenge of the game.
 Ill-feeling simmered as the managers made their changes.

Pinto
 tried to restructure his defence while Greece boss Fernando Santos 
threw on all the strikers he  could find. On came Kostas Mitroglou, 
Fulham’s record transfer, a £12million disaster for the Londoners, and 
then came Gekas.

Navas 
looked destined to keep the ball out of his net with a blend of skill 
and good fortune. Samaras glanced a header wide, promising opportunities
 were created and squandered, until the final few seconds.

The
 clock was slipping past 90 minutes when Navas flung himself to his left
 to block a crisp shot on the turn from Gekas, but his save dropped to 
Borussia Dortmund defender Papastathopoulos, who scored, crashing a 
volley into the turf and spinning over the goalkeeper.

With
 their extra man, Greece sensed their chance and went for it. Navas 
tipped over a header from Mitroglou before extra-time, a manic half-hour
 of end-to-end chaos. Both teams reshuffled but muscles were exhausted 
in the mugginess of Recife.

Touches
 became heavier and more passes went astray. There were spaces 
everywhere but no-one made it count. Mitroglou led a Greece 
counter-attack with a five-on-three advantage but Lazaros 
Christodoulopoulos could not beat the excellent Costa Rica goalkeeper.

Another
 chance fell to Mitroglou in added time at the end of extra-time but he 
dragged it wide. It was destined for penalties. And Navas was destined 
to be the hero.
