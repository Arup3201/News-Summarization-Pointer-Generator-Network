Margaret Thatcher would have rejected and confronted the ‘pessimism’ of Ukip, George Osborne said last night.

The Chancellor sought to seize the mantle of the late prime minister for today’s Conservatives, saying they should project an optimistic vision of Britain’s future and address the country’s self-doubt.

He likened Lady Thatcher’s mission to drag the country out of the malaise of the 1970s to that now facing the Government, and said the success in turning the economy round over the past five years showed Britain’s best days still lie ahead.

George Osborne has said Margaret Thatcher would have rejected and confronted the 'pessimism' of Ukip

Addressing the first Margaret Thatcher Conference on Liberty, organised by the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, Mr Osborne said Labour was represented by ‘pessimists’ who ‘don’t trust human instincts’ and want to ‘control and suppress them with a more powerful state’.

But in a clear reference to the rise of Ukip, which topped the polls in last month’s European elections, he added: ‘There’s also a pessimistic tendency that can emerge on the populist right. The tendency to bemoan the present day, and put the past on a pedestal.

‘It sees life as better in 1954 or even 1854, than 2014. It is a tendency that says Britain’s best days are behind it – when I believe our country’s brightest days lie ahead. Margaret Thatcher confronted and overcame the same pessimism in Britain in the 1970s. She was always talking the country up, not down. We must do the same.’

Former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken, Lady Thatcher’s unofficial biographer, has said she would not have voted Ukip but might have been ‘secretly cheering them on’.

But Mr Osborne suggested she would have dismissed Ukip’s pessimistic prospectus. ‘She believed Britain could be a strong economy again; that militant trade unions could be overcome; that the Cold War could be won,’ he told delegates at London’s Guildhall. ‘It is difficult to appreciate today how completely outside the consensus her confidence in Britain and its capabilities was.

‘Not just on the Left, but the Right too, a deep malaise had crept in. Managed decline had been the mantra until she arrived.

‘As optimistic Conservatives who believe in the power of ideas like freedom and aspiration, our generation’s mission is to confront and overcome this latest bout of western self-doubt. Our free market economy can be the most prosperous.’

Education Secretary Michael Gove undermined Mr Osborne’s message by telling the same conference that ‘living in the 18th century ... for many of us would be a very attractive thing to do’.
