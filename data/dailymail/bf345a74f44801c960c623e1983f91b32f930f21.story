The ‘patronising’ advert 
highlighting Budget cuts to bingo and beer duty that Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has been heavily criticised over was actually signed off Chancellor George Osborne, it is claimed.

Mr Shapps suffered a ferocious backlash on Twitter after posting the advert in an apparent bid to woo working-class voters.

But Tory MPs have claimed the advert was designed in the Treasury and the chairman has been left to take the blame.

Blame game: MPs claim that Tory chairman Grant Shapps has been left to take the fall for the controversial poster, which Chancellor George Osborne signed off, it is claimed

'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget

The Tory advert 
read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking 
people do more of the things they enjoy.’

Critics said the message reinforced public perceptions that the Conservative Party was out of touch with ordinary voters.

Government sources stressed that responsibility for the advert lay with Mr Shapps rather than the Treasury or No 10.

Some Tory MPs said the advert – which sparked dozens of internet spoofs
– raised questions about Mr Shapps’s ‘suitability’ for the 
job.

Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband

But others said it was ridiculous to blame Mr Shapps. One told the Sunday Telegraph: 'They could easily have defended him and said that it was a team effort, which it was.'

Another said Mr Shapps had kept quiet for fear of offending the Chancellor, adding: I'm not Grant's greatest fan but he has been treated pretty shabbily.'

The newspaper reported that a small team from Tory HQ went to the treasury to develop the ad with the Chancellor's aides and it was signed off by Lynton Crosby, the Tory election strategist, the Prime Minister's political secretary Stephen Gilbert and Mr Osborne.

A spokesman for the Conservative Party refused to comment.

After the furore, Downing Street insisted David Cameron had ‘full confidence’ in his party chairman, adding: ‘He thinks he’s doing a good job.’

But one
 senior Tory said: ‘When I saw this advert my initial thought was that 
it must be a spoof. My reaction when I realised it wasn’t was one of 
abject horror.’

Another 
exasperated Conservative MP said: ‘Has it boiled down to this? A Grant 
Shapps beer and bingo poster? God help us. It’s like they want us to 
lose.’

Mr Shapps urged Conservative 
supporters to ‘spread the word’.

One
 Tory source yesterday said the advert had been ‘pulled’ and would never
 be used again.

But a Tory spokesman insisted it had only ever been 
intended for use on  the internet and was never planned as a poster 
campaign.

The spokesman said: ‘We are quite proud of those tax cuts. We stand by what was said in that advert.

‘There is a misconception about it – it was never going to be a poster campaign, it was just an internet infographic. 

‘Some of the Left-wing intelligentsia may not like it but the reaction in bingo halls to the tax cut has been very positive.’

Liberal

 Democrat Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander described the wording
 of the advert as ‘pretty patronising’ and said it ‘demeans some 
quite sensible things’.

Nick
 Clegg added: ‘I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because the 
issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious.’

London
 Mayor Boris Johnson also declined to support the advert.

‘I didn’t 
write the blooming thing,’ he said.

‘We’re trying to get across the 
message that it’s a Budget for everyone.’

Shadow
 Chancellor Ed Balls said George Osborne must be ‘frustrated that his 
head of campaigns puts out an advert patronising working people by 
saying they’ll be happy with a bingo tax and a beer tax. What nonsense 
that is’.

Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire

But Mr Osborne 
dismissed the row, saying it had been ‘whipped up by the Labour Party’ 
to disguise the fact they had nothing to say about the Budget.

Mr
 Osborne said he had played bingo.

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said 
he did not know when Mr Cameron had last played bingo – or if he had 
ever played it at all.

However, he is known to enjoy a pint of real ale.

The internet was last night awash with spoof versions of Mr Shapps’s advert, which mock it for stereotyping the working class.

One
 posted on Twitter reads: ‘Bingo! No tax on pies, flat caps or whippets –
 keeping our commitment to patronise the working class. Now get off my 
land.’

Another says: ‘Bingo! I say, you there! How is your whippet? Jolly good, jolly good. Carry on.’
