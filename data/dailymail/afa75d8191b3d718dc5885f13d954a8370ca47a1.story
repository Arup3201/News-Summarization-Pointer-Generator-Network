Derren Brown's former cleaner was jailed for 16 months today for stealing blank cheques from the illusionist's home which were cashed in for more than £33,000.

Former teacher Rocio Pavon-Navarrete, 47, previously admitted stealing two signed cheques from the entertainer's home while he was absent.

Brown - famed for 'reading people's minds' - was away on his 2010 Enigma tour at the time.

She pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court last month to one charge of theft.

The cheques were signed by Brown's manager, James Cooper, but were left blank and stored at his home in Westminster for use by his assistant while the TV star and Mr Cooper were away on business.

Famed at being able to predict future events - including the winning lottery numbers - Derren Brown failed to spot his cleaner stealing from him

Pavon-Navarrete, of Greenwich, south-east London, took the cheques when her two businesses began to struggle.

The
cleaner then passed them to friend Bernard Ayanbanjo, 48, who paid them
into his account banking one for £11,500 and the other for £21,550.35.

After sentencing her to 16 months' imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court, the judge said that she had lied and her only regret was being caught.

Pavon-Navarrete was dismissed by Mr Brown in June 2010 but he did not realise the money had gone missing until his accountant noticed unusual transactions six months later.

Mr Brown, who is famed for his ability
to predict events including the winning lottery numbers, was only 
alerted it might be her after receiving a handwritten letter casting 
doubt on the honesty of his cleaners.

However but it took police almost a year to make an arrest despite the fact that she was always the ‘prime suspect.’

Channel 4 star Mr Brown joked afterwards: 'I suppose I should have seen this coming.'

The court heard the 
cleaner may have done it out of revenge when she was made redundant 
after working for Mr Brown for seven years.

But James Holland, defending, claimed the parting between the pair had been ‘amicable’ and said her only motive was money.

He told the court: 'She has two 
businesses. They were struggling due to a loss of a sum of money which 
was stolen. This was reported to police. Her problems started there.

'She
was under a degree of pressure in terms of finances and she succumbed 
to that pressure. She had the opportunity to take two cheques and she 
did so. For that she is extremely sorry.

'She
is genuinely sorry for what she has done. She felt once she had done 
she was trapped and could not see an escape out of it.'

The barrister said Ayanbanjo, who was a regular customer in her shop, told her he was interested in buying cheques which he would use as guarantees so she passed them on to him.

But he claimed his client never received any money from the amount that was cashed by Ayanbanjo.

However Judge David Higgins said he believed that was a ‘self-serving untruth.’

He said: 'Until you pleaded guilty you have lied throughout this case and it is plain you have continued to lie.'

He added he did not accept her expressions of remorse and said: 'They are quite inconsistent with your conduct throughout this case. No doubt you regret being caught but in my judgment nothing more.'

The Ecuadorian mother-of-three, who used to teach geography and history in her home country, came to the UK in 1999 and has now been granted citizenship.

She is putting two of her sons through university as one is studying economics at Lancaster and the other is taking a Masters degree in electrical engineering in Greenwich.

The court heard she has one previous conviction for shoplifting in 2004.

But the judge said: 'This matter is so serious only an immediate custodial sentence can reap it justice. The proper and least sentence which I may impose is one of 16 months.'

Pavon-Navarrete, of Greenwich, south east London, admitted theft from her employer between April and June 2010. She changed her plea to guilty just before her trial was due to start last month.

She had previously failed to turn up at court claiming she was in hospital with chest pains.

She suffered a heart attack in 2010 and was due to have an MRI scan later this month but Judge Higgins previously told her: 'They have very good medical facilities in Holloway.'

Pavon-Navarrate showed no emotion as she was led down to the cells.

To date just £950 of the cash has been recovered by police.

Ayanbanjo, of Woolwich, south east London, was also supposed to be sentenced today after being convicted of two counts of fraud between October and December 2010 but it was put back until October 19.
