Instincts: Couples should go with their gut feelings if they want to live happily ever after, a new study claims

If you want to know whether you and your partner will have a happy marriage, you should not let your heart or your head rule, it seems.

For the secret to predicting the chances of long-term marital bliss is down to basic gut instinct, a study claims.

Scientists have found we are better able to predict the long-term success of our relationship on a subconscious level, with lurking doubts a good indicator that trouble lies ahead.

Psychologists conducted tests on 135 newlywed couples, then checked their progress over  four years.

They found the feelings participants expressed when answering a questionnaire about their marriage had little bearing on their consequent satisfaction with their relationship.

But their gut instincts, revealed in series of tests, accurately mirrored their future level of happiness.

‘Although they may be largely unwilling or unable to verbalise them, people’s automatic evaluations of their partners predict one of the most important outcomes of their lives – the trajectory of their marital satisfaction,’ said lead researcher Dr James McNulty of Florida State University.

The study, published in the journal Science, looked at emotions buried under the surface and whether they affected an individual’s responses.

Photos of volunteers’ spouses were flashed on a computer screen for  a fraction of a second, followed by a positive word such as ‘awesome’ or  a negative one such as ‘awful’.

Participants had to choose whether they viewed the word as positive or negative.

‘People who have really positive feelings about their partners are  very quick to indicate that words  like awesome are positive words and very slow to indicate that words  like awful are negative words,’ said Dr McNulty.

Analysis: Couples' sub-conscious feelings for each other were tested

The opposite was also true, the 
researchers said, with participants who had negative feelings about 
their partners taking longer to respond to positive words and less time 
to respond to negative ones.

This was the case even when the individuals were not conscious of their conflicting emotions.

The couples were questioned about their level of relationship satisfaction every six months afterwards.

Those who had revealed negative or 
lukewarm feelings towards their partner reported the most marital 
dissatisfaction four years later.

‘Everyone wants to be in a good 
marriage,’ said Dr McNulty. ‘And in the beginning, many people are able 
to convince themselves of that at a conscious level.

‘But these automatic, gut-level responses are less influenced by what people want to think.

‘You can’t make yourself have a positive response through a lot of wishful thinking.

‘If they can sense that their gut is 
telling them that there is a problem, then they might benefit from 
exploring that, maybe even with a professional marriage counsellor.’

It's sub-conscious feelings that have a bearing on future happiness
