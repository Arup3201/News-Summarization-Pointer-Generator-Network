‘Beauty Mirror is designed to give users a very natural looking modified image through the addition of subtle effects, like skin clearing and slight weight loss,’ said Miriam Pettinen, director of partnerships and mobile strategy at Modiface.

‘We’re excited to bring an app to the marketplace that will not leave users looking very obviously edited, but instead just slightly more polished.’

Four pre-set looks and over 14 customisable effects such as weight loss and skin perfection can then be applied.

You can then record, save and share your modified videos with a single touch.

Through live simulation the app updates face location and pose every 0.03 seconds as up to 14 customisable effects are applied to the face while the user looks into the camera.

Some of the effects include eye enlargement, facelift, skin clearing, acne reduction and weight loss.

Users are able to take a picture of themselves at any point or record their transformation as a video, which is then saved directly to their device for sharing on social networks.

In the coming months Beauty Mirror technology will also be integrated as filters that users will be able to apply while using video chatting programs.

The technology will also be used by several anti-aging and skin-care brands for in-store product simulation.
