Council bosses have written to a public toilet to ask if a nearby shop should be allowed to sell alcohol.

Norwich City Council addressed the letter to 'the occupier' of the 'public convenience next to 150/152 Magdalen Street'.

The authority told 'the occupier' that a nearby store, E and J Euro, had asked the council for permission to sell alcohol - and invited them to comment on the application.

Flushed: Norwich City Council wrote to a public toilet asking if a nearby shop should be allowed to sell alcohol

The letter to the toilet, which has been shut for ten years, which was signed by licensing manager Ian Streeter said: 'The city council is committed to ensuring local residents are fully aware of any applications that have been received.'

It contained details of the proposed move and invited 'the occupier' to fill in a form declaring whether they supported or objected to the application.

Adding to the council's embarrassment, it
emerged today that the authority actually owns the toilet  - and closed
it more than a decade ago.

The brick building, which is sandwiched in an alleyway between a furniture shop and the remains of the city walls, is boarded up and padlocked.

'To the occupier': The council admitted their mistake today and said a computer was responsible for sending the letter, pictured above

Norwich City Council has made headlines in the past for other slip ups.In 2001, officers decided to chop down horse chestnut trees because they were worried about children being hurt while gathering conkers.Also that year, residents of a high rise tower were told to take down their window boxes - in case they fell on someone.Again in 2001, the council banned the use of bouncy castles on its land in case of injury.

All three decisions were reversed after public outcry.In June this year, the council told an award-winning gardener that her pot plants must be removed as they were a health and safety hazard.

It is covered in graffiti and its wooden door does not feature a letterbox. It is unknown how the letter was actually delivered.

The letter was forwarded to a local newspaper by an anonymous reader, who commented 'Through the keyhole: who lives in a house like this?'

The council today admitted the mistake, blaming a computer for the error.

A council spokesman said: 'We pride ourselves on how we carry out consultations over issues which will potentially affect people.

'And as part of that we're always keen to consult with a broad spectrum of people who usually have different views on the same topic.

'That said, on this occasion, we've clearly been over enthusiastic.

'We'll be having a stern word with the computer in question that issued this particular letter.'

E And J Euro have asked the council for permission to sell alcohol from 9am until 10pm Monday to Sundays.
