The emotional funerals of an young Orthodox Jewish couple who both died in a horrific hit-and-run car crash, but were survived by their premature baby son, took place on Sunday afternoon.

The driver of a BMW slammed into the 
car carrying Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, at an intersection in 
the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.

The seven-months pregnant woman was feeling ill so headed to hospital with her husband early Sunday when the car they were riding in was hit, killing them both.

Their baby boy was delivered by emergency caesarean and survived, yet remains in a serious condition in hospital.

Jewish law calls for burial of the 
dead as soon as possible, and hours after their deaths, the Glaubers 
were mourned at a funeral on Sunday.

The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest 
community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000.

The 
community has strict rules governing clothing, social customs and 
interaction with the outside world. Men wear dark clothing that includes
a long coat and a fedora-type hat and often have long beards and ear 
locks.

Hundreds of members of the Satmar community gathered shoulder to 
shoulder on the street outside, men in hats and women in shawls or head 
coverings, nearly everyone in black.

The sound of wailing filled the 
street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle.

After the funeral began, a speaker 
sobbed uncontrollably, his voice choked with grief and echoing over 
loudspeakers set up outside.

Just before, Nachman Glauber's cousin, Sara Glauber, said of her relative and his bride, 'if one had to go, the other had to go too because they really were one soul.'

Sara spoke admiringly of her cousin. 'You don't meet anyone better than him,' she said. 'He was always doing favors for everyone.'

She said Nachman's mother herself just delivered a baby two weeks ago.

'I've never seen a mother-son 
relationship like this,' said Sara Glauber. 'He called her every day to 
make sure everything was OK.

'He was the sweetest, most charming human 
being, always with a smile on his face.'

During the accident Raizy Glauber was 
thrown from the car
and her body landed under a parked tractor-trailer, said witnesses who 
came to the scene after the crash.

Nachman Glauber was pinned in the 
car, and emergency workers had to cut off the roof to get him out, 
witnesses said. Both died of blunt-force trauma, the medical examiner said.

The
Glaubers' driver was in stable condition, police said. Both the driver 
of the BMW and a passenger fled and were being sought, said officers.

On Saturday, Raizy Glauber 'was not feeling well, so they decided to go' to the hospital, said Sara Glauber.

Abraham said the Glaubers called a car service because they didn't own a car, which is common for New Yorkers.

The Glaubers were married about a 
year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizy 
Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara 
Glauber said.

Raised north of New York City in 
Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for 
Orthodox Jews, Nachman Glauber was studying at a rabbinical college 
nearby, said his cousin.

A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child
