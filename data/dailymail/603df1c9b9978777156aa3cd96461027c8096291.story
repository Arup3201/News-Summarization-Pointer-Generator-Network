Pensioners are being warned to use protection on board cruise ships if they plan on having flings after a rise in the number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among the elderly.

A new government fact-sheet, titled 'Travel health on board cruise ships' has warned cruise passengers - who are predominantly over the age of 50 - that they should be prepared if they plan to have sex.

The advice reads: 'If there is a chance you might have casual sex, be prepared: take in-date, good quality condoms with you.'

There is also a warning that the consumption of alcohol can lead people to 'lose their inhibitions,' and that taking care of your sexual health should always be priority.

Worrying, sexually transmitted infections are on the rise in the over-65 age group. Here are some facts and figures from the period 2009-2013...

Chlamydia

2009 - 94 (84 men, 10 women)

2013 - 298 (242 men, 53 women)

Gonorrhoea

2009 - 60 (56 men, four women)

2013 - 126 (117 men, nine women)

Herpes

2009 - 158 (109 men, 49 women)

2013 - 265 (163 men, 102 women)

Syphilis

2009 - 33 (32 men, one woman)

2013 - 46 (40 men, six women)

Warts

2009 - 316 (262 men, 54 women)

2013 - 417 (329 men, 88 women)

Last year, the average UK passenger age of those who go on cruises was 57 and a quarter of passengers are over 60 years old.

Despite many lines seeking to attract a younger clientele and families, the average age has risen from 54.8 to 57 in the last ten years. 

Travellers over the age of 60 also make up more than a quarter of cruise passengers, according to statistics.

Statistics taken from 2009-2013 show an alarming rise in the number of STI diagnoses for men and women aged 65+.

There were 295 confirmed cases of chlamydia in 2013, 242 of these were men with 53 women. 

The stats make worrying reading as in 2009 the number of confirmed cases was 94; 84 being attributed to men and 10 to women.

The amount of people aged 65+ being diagnosed for gonorrhoea has more than doubled for the years 2009-2013.

In 2009, 56 men aged over 65 and 60 women were diagnosed with gonorrhoea. In 2013 those numbers had risen significantly; there were 117 males cases of gonorrhoea and 126 where women were concerned.

There have also been increases in cases of herpes, syphilis and genital warts. 

A study recently published in Student BMJ found more than 80 per cent of people between the ages of 60 and 90 are sexually active, and the number of STIs among this group has doubled in the past 10 years.

'People are making midlife changes and going back into dating and maybe never have used condoms when they started out many years ago,' Eli Coleman, director of the Program in Human Sexuality and the University of Minnesota Medical School, told ABC News.

'They also think of their grandmother's old fashioned condoms and know nothing about the availability of them now or how to use them.'
