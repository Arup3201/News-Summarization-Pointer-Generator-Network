The son of a Government minister has quit the Royal Marines after admitting assaulting two men in a row over racist slurs.

Benjamin Grant is the son of Tory Sport and Tourism Minister Helen Grant MP, who described seeing him awarded his green beret three years ago as 'one of the proudest days of her life'.

But the 22-year-old has quit the Armed Forces after a fight outside a nightclub for which he escaped immediate punishment following a judge's finding he was provoked.

Former Royal Marine Benjamin Grant lashed out over alleged racial abuse outside a nightclub. A judge gave him a conditional discharge because of the 'very exceptional circumstances' of the case

Grant, who served in Afghanistan with the Marines, left the elite Corps after being involved in a fracas outside a night club in Barnstaple, North Devon in November last year.

He was serving as a driver with the Commando Logistics Brigade at RMB Chivenor and had just returned from a four-week exercise on Salisbury Plain when he went out clubbing with friends.

He was caught on CCTV punching a 20-year-old birthday party reveller in the face after accusing him of racially insulting him and pushing another man away as he tried to separate them.

A jury at Exeter Crown Court cleared Grant and fellow marine James Stott of causing grievous bodily harm to bystander Ryan Behn, 19, who suffered a broken jaw in the melee.

Grant, who gave his address as the £1.8 million family home in  Surrey, had previously admitted assault by battery on Jack Yarde, 20, and Curtis Wenham, 19. He was given a two-year conditional discharge by the judge today.

Judge Phillip Wassall said: 'You are of good character until that evening. I am quite satisfied you only acted in that way because you were on the end of vile and objectionable racist taunts.

Grant's mother is Helen Grant, the Tory Sport and Tourism Minister who is widely considered to be a rising star in David Cameron's cabinet

'You should not have pushed Mr Wenham out of the way or struck Mr Yarde with a punch. It is very difficult for anyone who is not from a minority ethnic group to understand how hurtful it is to be called a P*** b****** or worse.

'Such are the extenuating features that I am making a conditional discharge in the light of very exceptional circumstances.'

The judge made no order for compensation because Grant was 'subjected to such outrageous provocation'.

Grant's mother, Helen, is one of David Cameron's A-listers who became Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald at the last election.

She has served as a junior minister at the Ministry of Justice, where her responsibilities included women, equality, and victims' rights.

The incident involving her son broke out on a pavement in Barnstaple, Devon when Grant got into an argument with Mr Yarde, who he said had repeatedly called him a 'P*** c***'.

CCTV showed Mr Yarde  shout something as Mr Wenham stepped in to try to keep them apart and Grant then pushed him away before punching Mr Yarde in the face and grabbing Mr Behn in a headlock and dragging him to the ground.

Grant was then chased by Mr Yarde and Mr Wenham. Mr Behn got up but was then felled by a blow from Mr Stott.

Grant, of Tadworth, Surrey, and Stott, 30, of York, denied causing grievous bodily harm to Mr Behn and were found not guilty at Exeter Crown Court after a week-long trial.

Defence barristers had argued it was impossible to say who had inflicted the broken jaw and that both were acting either in self defence or in defence of the other.

The prosecution said the two men were acting together in a joint enterprise but the CCTV showed Stott was not even in the picture when Grant started the fight.

Grant claimed he reacted to racist abuse from Mr Yarde. He said he had experienced racial 'banter' in the Marines, including being called 'Terry Taliban', but this abuse was different.

He said: 'I don't take offence at racial banter but it is different if someone who you don't know says it in a nasty way. I am not going to take it.

'I took my coat off because I was going to confront him and ask him what his problem was and why he was saying this. If he had said sorry I would 100 per cent have walked away.'

He added: 'He used the same words again and his friend was keeping me back. He grabbed me and was telling me to eff odd. I pushed Mr Wenham away and punched Mr Yarde in the face.

'I got Mr Behn in a headlock and got him to the floor. I did not hit him. I grabbed him because I saw his hand come up in my peripheral vision. I had no quarrel with him or Mr Wenham.'

Grant said he has left the Royal Marines since the incident and is now working as a civilian and has a girlfriend who is eight-months pregnant.

Mr Yarde told the jury he could not remember making any racist comments.

Stott, who is a special forces medic, said he had not been with Grant in the club but came out to see him being attacked and had rushed to his aid.

He thought Mr Behn was about to corner Grant. He said he hit him to prevent him doing so.
