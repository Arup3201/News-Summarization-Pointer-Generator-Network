The USA’s heart-breaking defeat to Belgium on Tuesday night was the highest-rated World Cup match ever shown on the ESPN network.

Jurgen Klinsmann’s side were beaten 2-1 after extra time as Belgium advanced to a quarter-final with Argentina.

Goalkeeper Tim Howard was in outstanding form as he kept the European side at bay before his resistance was finally broken by Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. Julian Green pulled a goal back for the Americans.
