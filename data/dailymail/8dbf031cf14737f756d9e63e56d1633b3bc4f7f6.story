A former bookmaker and party-loving mother-of-three looks set to claim the title of Miss Universe after becoming a UK bodybuilding champion in her first ever competition.

Louise Grayson, 31, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, stunned judges and fellow competitors at last weekend's NAC British Championships at the Manchester Arena... a mere 18 months after first hitting the gym with intent.

Louise - who has six-year-old twin girls Codie and Courtney and a son called Bradley, 12 - was the only debutant in the contest, and following her success is now setting her sights on the Miss Universe competition to be held in Manchester in November.

Louise was the only debutant in the competition in Manchester, and her win gave her a taste for success, leaving her determined to win the Miss Universe title in November

Just 18 months ago Louise used to be a real 'party girl', always choosing a night out drinking with friends over a trip to the gym

Rising at 6am each morning, eating a diet of nothing but fish for five weeks and enduring arduous training sessions in the gym were all key to the success of the 31-year-old who has transformed herself from party girl to 'supermum'.

Louise said: 'I still can't believe that I'm a British bodybuilding champion. I was the only debutant at the event and all the others were stunned... but none more than me. Until 18 months ago I'd class myself as a bit of a party girl!'

Louise's partner, Chris Lloyd runs a gym and nutritional supplements business, but she'd always stayed away from the gym in the past, preferring a night out to a training session.

She said: 'Chris never encouraged me to get into the gym. I just started training and when I saw the changes in my body I knew that I wanted to do something with it. Now I'm hooked. I love training and the adrenaline hit it brings. It's great.'

Louise, a former bookmaker with 
Ladbrokes at branches throughout Rotherham, has now teamed up with Chris
 at his business, Streetwise Supplements Ltd, at Gateway Court, 
Parkgate.

Her remarkable win at Sunday's NAC 
Championships has seen her qualify automatically for the body building 
world championships in Cyprus later this year.

But
 she is uncertain she will go as she already struggles with a packed 
schedule of training, work and fulfilling her role as mother to three 
young children. So instead she is focusing on the Miss Universe contest 
back in Manchester in November.

Along with Louise's own children, Chris' 11-year-old son Daniel completes the family.

She said: 'It has been hard fitting the training in at times, but I'm usually up and away at 6am for an hour-long cardio session and I'm back before they even get up so that I can get them ready for school.

'They've all been really supportive. They call me "fit mum" now and the twins come and pose with me in the mirror.'

Louise trains four days a week and takes classes at Chris's gym, hoping that she can inspire others to get fit. Her regime changes depending on her proximity to a competition, as does her diet.

For the past weeks, she has eaten nothing but fish and has only now been able to re-introduce other food into her meals.

A relieved Louise admitted: 'It's nice to have potatoes and things again. The appeal of a fish breakfast soon wears off.'

Proud
 partner Chris, who trained Louise to victory despite having no 
experience of bodybuilding competition, said: 'I'm really proud of what 
she's achieved.

'When we 
first met she was a party girl and she really only got into training 
about 18 months ago.

'To win a national contest is just unbelievable. 
She's a real inspiration. Hopefully it'll encourage others to get in the
 gym and get fit.'
