The Pentagon wants to spend billions on three new Air Force One planes to replace the existing two Boeing 747s currently used by the president.

The existing planes have been in service since 1991 and the military argue that they're getting too old and need to be replaced.

They've requested $102 million from Congress this year to help buy the planes, with the figure growing to more than $3 billion over the next five years.

Those numbers don't include the final three years of the project, reports CBS News.

While some may question whether taxpayers can afford to buy the new planes, Air Force Col. Amy McCain argues that they can't afford not to. 

'It's the only 747-200 left in the United States that is flying. So it costs a lot more time and money to keep that airplane flying than it used to. It's actually cheaper in the long run to replace it,' she said.

'The top priority is an affordable aircraft that will meet the presidential requirements,' said McCain, who is in charge of ordering the new Air Force One.

'We're buying up to three. It depends on all the availability of having two airplanes available for the president at any one time.'

The Air Force hopes to sign the first contract with Boeing later this year. The goal is to have the new planes flying the president by 2023.

At six stories tall and two-thirds the size of a football field, the Air Force One is the most recognizable aircraft in the world

In January the Air Force announced its intention to use Boeing's 747-8 airframe.

The long-range, wide-body aircraft is made in Everett, Washington. It comes with a longer fuselage, greater wing span and new engines and avionics. It will be heavily modified with all of the latest technological and security gear.

Once the new planes are introduced, the current Air Force One will go to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, home to nine previous presidential aircraft.
