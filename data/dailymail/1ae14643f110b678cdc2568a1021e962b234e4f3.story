Members of a small private school community in Pennsylvania are reeling after administrators claimed Monday that one of the school's founders engaged in a 'sexual relationship with a student' in the 1950s.

The allegation was published in a letter on the website of the Solebury School, located an hour north of Philadelphia, which in recent months has been conducting investigations into a number of abuse allegations against teachers spanning multiple decades.

Thomas Wilschutz, who currently heads the school, wrote that he is 'now ready to confirm' that a co-founder, Robert Shaw, had sexual relations with a student.

The investigation into child abuse at Solebury began earlier in the year, when administrators brought allegations of abuse between the 1950s to the 1970s to the attention of police and the District Attorney's office of Bucks County, according to the  Courier Times.

One former student from Solebury now in her 50s claims that she had sex with a male teacher in the 1970s, when he was in his mid-20s and she was 14, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

'I was not raped,' she said, 'but it shouldn't have happened.'

The student claims that the school never contacted her to discuss the allegations, though she came forward in the early 2000s.

Another female student claims that she was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a Solebury teacher in the 2000s.

Through a statement released by her lawyer, Jeff Fritz, she said that the school knew of the 'inappropriate contact' but failed to contact police or other officials.

This is not the first time the school has dealt with issues of sexual abuse. In 1997, former theater teacher David 
Chadwick was convicted for engaging in a sexual relationship with a 
15-year-old student in 1993.

Close quarters: Collaboration and friendship were encouraged between students and teachers at Solebury, a private boarding school on 90 acres in Pennsylvania

The school says it is removing items that 'honor Robert Shaw,' including a portrait that hangs in the dining hall.

Shaw passed away in 1982. School officials say that another deceased teacher is among those accused.

Shaw was one of four co-founders of Solebury, which opened in 1925 with just four students. The boarding school is located on a 90 acre campus in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

Solebury's website says that the mission was 'to start a small school with an informal atmosphere,' where 'friendship between teachers and pupils would be encouraged,' in the words of the school's first headmaster, Doc Washburn.

In an earlier letter from July that revealed the allegations to the public, the school acknowledged that the policy of a 'close and collaborative relation' between students and teachers was integral to its mission, but put down the notion it excused sexual contact.

'We will not permit that ideal to be used as a proxy or a justification for an inappropriate sexual relationship between an adult and a student at Solebury School. Not in the past. Not now. Not in the future.'
