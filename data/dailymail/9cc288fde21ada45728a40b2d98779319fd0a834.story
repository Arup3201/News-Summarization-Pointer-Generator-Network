The recent ruling to reform the New York Police Department's controversial 'stop-and-frisk' tactic has already led to a sharp rise in shootings, new figures reveal.

In the month after the policy was ruled unconstitutional shootings spiked nearly 13 per cent while gun seizures fell almost a fifth, the figures show.

In the 28 days up to September 8 there were 140 shootings across the city, compared with 124 over the same period last year, according to NYPD statistics.

The shocking rise in gun crime has emerged days after the federal judge who ordered an overhaul of the stop-and-frisk strategy refused to delay it pending an appeal by the city.

U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin said such a delay would send 'precisely the wrong signal.'

She had ordered changes in August after finding the program discriminates against minorities. Police have stopped, questioned and sometimes patted down about 5million people over a decade.

Dismissing the suggestion that reforms of the 'stop-and-frisk' strategy be delayed, Judge Scheindlin wrote: 'Ordering a stay now would send precisely the wrong signal.

'It would essentially confirm that the past practices, resulting in hundreds of thousands of stops - overwhelmingly of minorities - that resulted in little or no enforcement action or seizure of contraband were justified and based on constitutional police practices.

'It would also send the message that reducing the number of stops is somehow dangerous to the residents of this city.'

But with figures showing the number of gunshot victims up 9 per cent over the same period last year following the ruling on August 12, that's the message implicit in the latest statistics on gun crime on NYC.

Seizures of firearms are also down, with 239 taken by police between August 10 and September 8, compared with 289 over the same period last year, according to the statistics seen by the New York Post.

And gun charges have fallen by more than 15 per cent from 492 last year to 417 this year. Sources blamed Scheindlin's ruling for the disturbing trends.

A police department source told the Post that police are reluctant to stop and search because 'they're scared of being sued.'

'They feel as if the city is not going to indemnify them in lawsuits,' the source said.

Judge Scheindlin has not commented on today's statistics, but on Tuesday she criticised 'certain high-level city officials and pundits' who have misinterpreted her ruling.

She said she did not order an end to the stop-and-frisk program but instead insisted that it be carried out legally.

And she defended her remedies, which include the appointment of a monitor to ensure the program's legality and of a facilitator to conduct meetings with interested parties in neighborhoods where frequent stops occur.

She had also ordered some officers to wear cameras.

She said the vast majority of the overhaul won't be implemented until the monitor and the facilitator meet with the community, the police department and other stakeholders to create sensible solutions.

'In short, the only activity at this stage is discussion between the monitor, the facilitator and the parties to develop the remedies,' she said. 'No other specific relief is imminent, much less ordered.'

Michael A. Cardozo, the city's top lawyer, said in a statement that the city remains committed to reversing Scheindlin's rulings as quickly as possible.

He noted that the city has asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan for an expedited appeal so police officers are not in limbo.

'We cannot afford such delay, as public safety is of paramount concern to the mayor and the police commissioner,' he said.
