West Ham will have to pay Arsenal £10million to make full-back Carl Jenkinson's move permanent.

The 23-year-old has impressed for the Hammers during his loan spell, with manager Sam Allardyce  a big fan of the defender.

West Ham co-owner David Gold hinted on Sunday that the club would push to make the deal permanent in the summer.

However, Jenkinson, who has made 24 appearances this season, is valued at £10m plus by Arsenal.

Under the terms of his loan, Jenkinson is unable to face Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday and Gold told a fan on social media: 'He will not play against Arsenal. This year.'
