The chipped vase, pictured, sold for £634,000, after an expert identified it as a Chinese relic

A chipped vase a couple kept artificial flowers in has sold for £634,000, after it was discovered to be an 18th century Chinese relic. 

The unnamed husband and wife inherited the damaged vase from the woman's late father and were 'completely oblivious' about is origin and value.

They emailed an auction house photos of some 'modest' antiques they were considering selling, including one of the 16 inch tall pea green vase.

And an expert immediately identified the porcelain vase as unique and made in the 18th century for one of the palaces of the Chinese Emperor Qianlong.

A large chunk of the rim had broken off some time in the 19th century and then crudely fixed using staples.

It it not known how and when the famille rose and calligraphic vase left China but it was bought at a sale in the 1960s by the owner's late father.

She and her husband inherited it and kept it in the corner of their lounge to put fake flowers in - and they were thrilled when the auction house put a pre-sale estimate of £10,000 on the piece.

And with bidders lined up from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Canada on the day of the sale, the price soon shot up to £100,000 before escalating to a final hammer price of £520,000.

With fees added on, the total price paid for the item was £634,400 - and it is thought the sale price would have been at least double the amount had the vase been in good condition.

Tom Rowsell, of auctioneers Toovey's of West Sussex, said: 'It is like a lottery win for the couple.

'I sent them an email an hour after the sale to give them the good news. They replied and asked if I had added on some zeros by mistake.

'They were delighted. The Chinese market is incredibly strong at the moment and this sale demonstrates some of the phenomenal sums people are happy to pay.'

The vase once made up a small group of highly-desirable wares bearing Emperor Qianlong's own poetic text and seal mark on the bottom.

The emperor's words praise the merits of four native flowers relating to the seasons in China; peony for spring, lotus for summer, chrysanthemum for autumn and plum blossom for winter.

Mr Rowsell added: 'The owners didn't really know anything about it, it was just something the woman's father had picked up at some stage at a charity sale in the 1960s.

'He would have paid an unremarkable sum for it because he never hinted that it was valuable.

'The vendors were completely oblivious to its significance.

'They stored dried flowers in it and tucked it away in the corner of their lounge.

'I was scrolling through eight or nine emails including theirs and suddenly a picture of this vase appeared. It was obvious that it was a very high quality piece.

'I picked up the phone straight away and left a message to say that I thought it could be special, despite the chips and damage to it.

'A couple of days later the couple brought the vase in a box wrapped in bubble wrap. As soon as I unpacked it it was quite apparent they had a very valuable piece.

'Because of its damaged and repaired condition we gave it a conservative estimate which the vendors were delighted with.

'They are recently retired and this large sum of money is an ideal retirement present for them.'
