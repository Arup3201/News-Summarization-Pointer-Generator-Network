An oil painting by a famous Welsh artist was stolen from the Royal Festival Hall – but nobody noticed for more than a week.

Sir Kyffin Williams' work, Landscape At Llanaelhaearn, vanished from a secure room at the London venue at the end of September.

It was not reported missing until October 6 when a member of staff found its smashed frame in a toilet cubicle.

Stolen: Landscape at Llanaelhaearn by Sir Kyffin Williams, whose works now fetch up to £50,000

Sir Kyffin, pronounced Cuffin, completed the 20in by 24in piece in 1947. 

He was renowned for his subtle use of pastel greens and greys to recreate the Welsh countryside. Nowadays many of his works fetch up to £50,000.

The painting, which depicts a figure looking out at a dark and rugged landscape, had been on display since November 2013, and was on loan from the Arts Council Collection.

The landscape was stolen from the Royal Retiring Room, which is kept locked when it is not being used for concerts and events.

The theft is an embarrassment because it was on loan from the Arts Council.

Detective Constable Ray Swan, from Scotland Yard's Art and Antiques Unit, said: 'Whoever stole this painting is likely to try to sell it. I urge anyone who is offered the painting to report the matter to us immediately, or contact us if you know anything about the theft or the painting's whereabouts.'
