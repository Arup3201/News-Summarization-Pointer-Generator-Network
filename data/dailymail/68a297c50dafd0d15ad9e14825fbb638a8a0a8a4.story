The ultimate fridge for grazers has been unveiled by South Korean group LG.

The 'Door-in-Door Mega-Capacity' refrigerator has shelves built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment.

Called Model LPXS346C, the new Door-In-Door fridge model has 34 cubic feet of space, and LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened.

The latest 'Door-in-Door Mega-Capacity' refrigerator is an upgrade to LG's existing 'Door-in-Door French-door' refrigerator.

It also features LG's Smart Diagnosis technology, which is designed to help LG's call centre staff to identify any problems that arise with the fridge remotely.

An Android smartphone app also allows users to 'record and analyse signals from the refrigerator'. 

The fridge was unveiled at CES in Las Vegas this week, and will be available later this year. There is currently no information on its cost.

The South Korean company also unveiled a washing machine with two washers that lets people save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously.

The South Korean tech giant also used the event to announce its next-generation flexible phone, called G Flex 2.

It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit octa-core processor, with 2GB of RAM.

The 5.5-inch full HD curved display has a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a 403 Pixel Per Inch density.

It runs Android Lollipop and the whole device is said to be 30 per cent more durable than the original model.   

Homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app. 

It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.'

For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash.

When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. 

The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology.

This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home.

LG's latest washing machine uses a Twin Wash system to clean two loads simultaneously. The machine has a main washer above a smaller washer in the pedestal beneath (pictured). LG said the the mini washer is perfect for items that need specific settings, and it can also be fitted to any of LG's front loading machines

While the NFC tagging technology, means users can download pre-programmed wash cycles to their smartphones, and start them by touching the phone on the machine. 

It also has a Smart Diagnosis feature that helps users to quickly identify issues and faults.

Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'From an ergonomic point of view, you can see why a phone with a bend would be more comfortable when making a call, curving from ear to mouth, or when slotted into your back pocket. 

'Ultimately, though, the curved body is more a gimmick than a standout feature. Fortunately, the updated specs mean this smartphone has plenty more to shout about.'
