Defensive end Michael Strahan has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Strahan
 was one of the game's most dominant pass-rushers during 15 seasons with
 the New York Giants. He was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and the 
league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2001.

Now known for his popularity on Live with Kelly and Michael the footballer brought some laughs to the proceedings as his co-host blew him a proud kiss from the stands.

Strahan's Live! With Kelly And Michael co-host Kelly Ripa cheered her partner on as he accepted his induction

Stahan gave his acceptance speech in his 
new gold jacket complimented with a tie striped to match the Giants' 
red, white, and blue.

Strahan, one of the game's most dominant pass-rushers, closed the ceremony that ended just before midnight - nearly two hours later than scheduled.

The defensive end cracked he was still a little scared of former New York Giants teammate Lawrence Taylor. Strahan singled out former Philadelphia tackle Jon Runyan in the crowd and referred to him as his toughest opponent and '350 pounds of twisted steel and non-sex appeal.'

The ceremony went so late that Strahan noted that it was past his bedtime and joked that if the event lasted any longer he and his fellow inductees would be considered the 2015 class.

Strahan joked he was once chubby 13-year-old working out to Jane Fonda tapes.

'My life is improbable,' Strahan said. 'I am an absolutely 
improbable Hall of Famer. I'm an improbable football player.'

'My life is improbable,' Strahan saidn during his induction. 'I am an absolutely improbable Hall of Famer. I'm an improbable football player.'

Having once lived in Mannheim, Germany, he called New York the 'scariest city' he'd ever been to.

'My hope for my kids is that I showed 
you that improbability means absolutely nothing because anything is 
possible,' he said.

His 141 1/2 career sacks rank fifth on the NFL list.

He retired following the 2007 season, after helping the Giants win the Super Bowl.

Strahan closed the induction ceremony by being introduced by TV broadcaster Jay Glazer.

The
 seven-member Hall of Fame class is rounded out by receiver Andre Reed, 
offensive tackle Walter Jones, linebacker Derrick Brooks, defensive back
 Aeneas Williams, punter Ray Guy and defensive end Claude Humphrey.

Andre
 Reed delivered the emotion and managed to hook up for one more catch 
from Jim Kelly on the Pro Football Hall of Fame stage.

Strahan was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2001, and had 22 1/2 sacks in 2001 to set the NFL single-season record

Turning his back to the crowd, Reed caught a pass from Kelly before sharing a lengthy hug with his former teammate and now fellow Hall of Famer.

It was a fitting finish for a tandem that set a then-NFL record by hooking up 663 times in Buffalo. And it was a moment that paid homage to the quarterback, who has spent the past 14 months battling cancer.

'You taught us not to quit,' Reed said about Kelly. 'You have endured a lot in your life. The loss of your son, and most recently your battle with cancer. You're an inspiration to all you touch.'

Kelly was near tears, and the thousands of Bills fans in the crowd cheered.

Even louder cheers went up when Reed delivered a message to any Bills prospective ownership group having an intention of buying and relocating the franchise.

'Oh yeah, and the Bills will stay in Buffalo, too,' Reed said.

The Bills are on the block after founder and Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March.
