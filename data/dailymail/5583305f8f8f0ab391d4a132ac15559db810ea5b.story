A blame game over the ‘lacklustre’ No campaign is under way before the votes have been cast in the Scottish independence referendum.

David Cameron was yesterday accused of ignoring warnings from senior officials about the chances of a Yes vote.

There is also growing unease at Westminster at the last-ditch offers being made to Scotland to persuade it to stay in the UK.

David Cameron, pictured,  is facing intense criticism over his handling of the Scottish independence campaign 

The three main party leaders have committed to agreeing a package of further devolution, including powers over tax, spending and welfare, within six weeks of a No vote.

One senior MP said: ‘It all smacks terribly of panic. Worst of all, it’s all being dictated by Gordon Brown.’ A former minister said: ‘It’s crisis politics. This is the worst example but it’s part of a pattern. The whole thing has been a total shambles.’

And Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell became the first to suggest publicly that Mr Cameron might have to consider resigning in the event of a Yes vote.

He said: ‘I hope Scots vote to stay; if it goes wrong... the Prime Minister will have to decide what the honourable thing is to do.’

With frantic last-minute efforts being made to tell Scots that backing No is a positive vote for giving more powers to Edinburgh, senior figures in all three main parties are saying privately that a third option of ‘devo max’ should have been offered.

Scotland’s First Minister, Alex Salmond, initially wanted a three-option ballot, but Mr Cameron insisted on a straightforward Yes/No question.

Mr Salmond won concessions, rejecting the argument that expat Scots should get a vote and insisting that 16- and 17-year-olds, seen as more likely to back independence, took part.

Princess Anne, right, caused speculation on a visit to Shetland yesterday – by wearing the colours of the Scottish Saltire.

Dressed head to toe in white and blue, she opened a new wing of Shetland College, as part of her role as chancellor of the University of the Highlands and Islands.

She has not voiced her opinion on independence, but is known to adore Scotland and often holidays there.

In January 2012, Mr Cameron said the referendum should take place ‘sooner rather than later’, but Mr Salmond demanded it was put off until now.

The Prime Minister sought to deflect criticism of his handling of the referendum, telling BBC2’s Newsnight on Monday: ‘I think it was right to have one question, because, of course, if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland wants more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: “Do you want to stay in the UK?”

‘Of course, that wasn’t just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other UK parties who all thought it was important, let’s settle the question of separation and then look at devolution.’

Meanwhile, the Financial Times yesterday reported claims that senior civil servants attempted to raise the alarm about the risks of the break-up of the UK.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his predecessor, Lord O’Donnell, are both said to have warned that while Mr Salmond’s sole focus for two years has been building support for independence, there was a danger that Westminster would concentrate on other matters.

Some Conservative backbenchers are angry that the plan to save the Union is relying on Gordon Brown  

But a Downing Street source said it was ‘complete and utter nonsense’ to say that a No vote had been taken for granted, pointing out that Mr Cameron had made ten campaign visits to Scotland and the Government had published dozens of papers about the potential risks of separation.

The Cabinet Office said it was ‘simply not true’ that Sir Jeremy had given such warnings.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is also expected to face a leadership crisis in the event of a No vote. He agreed that the Better Together campaign should be led by former chancellor Alistair Darling, parachuting in Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander in the closing months amid concerns about its effectiveness.

While more than 95 per cent of Conservative voters in Scotland are planning to vote No, working-class Labour voters are supporting independence in growing numbers.

‘There is a real battle going on for Labour votes, and it is down to Labour to win it,’ said one Government source. ‘It is up to Ed Miliband to deliver his voters.’
