Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini has revealed he would be interested in signing Lucas Leiva if Liverpool were keen on selling the Brazilian midfielder.

'Lucas is a great player but he is a Liverpool player and it will be hard to get him,' said Mancini. 'It certainly would be useful to us as he could help our youngsters grow.'

The Brazilian star has started in six Premier League games for Liverpool and is under contract with the Reds until June 2017.

Inter Milan, on the other hand, have dismissed reports they are interested in signing Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon during the winter transfer window.

The Italian outfit are looking to reinforce their attacking line when the window opens in the new year, but the England international is not one of their targets despite media speculation in England suggesting otherwise.

'Lennon? We are not interested in the Tottenham player,' Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told his club's official website. 'He does not have the profile we are looking for.

'When you build a team you follow the guidelines of the coach at the same and that is what we did.

'Now we have a new coach (Roberto Mancini) and we will see what we can do in the transfer market in January.

'We will try to make the coach happy although we and our fans need to be realistic as we must respect our financial plan.'

Mancini has refuted claims he is keen on signing Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon 

Mancini, who replaced the sacked Walter Mazzarri last month to return to Inter for a second stint, also denied an interest in Lennon.

The 27-year-old midfielder has had limited playing time under Spurs coach boss Mauricio Pochettino, starting just three Premier League games this season.

'We have not spoken about Lennon but about other players,' Mancini said. 'We will see what we are able to do.

'(Atletico Madrid winger Alessio) Cerci? He could be an aim of ours but right now he is an Atletico Madrid player and we have to wait and see what happens.'
