There is nothing quite as pleasing as arriving on a wet Friday evening off a busy commuter train to a glowing cottage with a kitchen stocked with local treats.

A tot of cider brandy, anyone? We need it after that journey.

We are staying in pretty Chapel Cottage in Somerset, which is cosy - with its wood-burner in an inglenook fireplace. The taller among us have to mind our heads. This is chocolate-box territory.

Shelter from the storm: Chapel Cottage sits just outside the picturesque Somerset village of Blackford

We plan on battening down.

But the lovely surrounding countryside and diminutive village of Blackford at the end of the lane (19th-century church, a sprinkling of houses, horse-riders and hearty walkers) begs to be explored.

It is hilly, with signposted walks. There’s plenty to see - but a lot of it depends on the weather.

Even the sweeping Dorset coastline (within an hour’s drive) can be a little dispiriting in the winter drizzle. Instead we opt for Salisbury, an hour’s drive away. The cathedral is rightly the main attraction.

Built in the early 13th century, it is an ornate place of worship, and boasts England’s tallest spire. At 414 ft, it has held the title since the 16th century.

All very cosy: The cottage sleeps up to six people, but can also be a splendid location for a couple's weekend

Oh the weather outside is frightful: Chapel Cottage's fireside lounge makes a fine retreat from the rainiest day

If you have a head for heights, you can take a tower tour and see the wood scaffolding erected in the 14th century for repair work. Outside are views of the surrounding landscape from which Constable painted one of his most famous late works, Salisbury Cathedral From The Water Meadows.

Next door is Salisbury Cathedral School. It’s an attractive city to wander around, especially when the houses are decked up in their Christmas finery.

Back at the thatched cottage, there is a ring binder full of recommendations for local pubs, but we are happy to do no more than settle in by the fire with that cider brandy.

Premier Cottages (01963 441311, www.premiercottages.co.uk) has a week’s stay in Chapel Cottage from £595 for up to six people. A three-night short break is from £350.
