Sea captains have reported ‘funeral processions’ and grieving behaviour in bottlenosed dolphins

And now a new study suggests that Atlantic spotted dolphins also mourn the death of their offspring.

Scientists reported four adult dolphins ‘displaying nurturant behaviour’ by supporting a dead calf in the waters off Madeira.

A new study suggests that Atlantic spotted dolphins (stock image) mourn the death of offspring. Scientists reported four adult dolphins ‘displaying nurturant behaviour’ by supporting a dead calf in the waters off Madeira, as well as another instance of the behaviour

A group of researchers from the University of Porto, Portugal, studied two instances of nurturing and seemingly sympathetic behaviour.

The first was noted by the operator of a tourist boat and recorded four adult dolphins supporting the body of a dead calf using their backs and heads, which continued for half an hour before the group moved on, Wired reported. 

The second was seen by staff on a research vessel. They said that one dolphin, thought to be a mother, was supporting a dead calf on the water’s surface.

‘The in situ observations show that adult Atlantic spotted dolphins try to support their dead calves at surface, either involving a single individual (presumably the mother) or several individuals,’ the researchers wrote in the study, published in Acta Ethologica.

The second, was seen by staff on a research vessel. They said that one dolphin, thought to be a mother, was supporting a dead calf on the water’s surface.

Post mortem examinations were carried out on the dolphin carcasses described in the study, as well as two other dead calves, which were found floating alone nearby.

They revealed that the four calves died from natural causes and not from predation or violent pod behaviour.

‘The highly fresh condition of the carcasses suggests that the adults abandon them after a short period of time (hours),’ according to the study.

Filipe Alves, who led the study, said there are records of other dolphin species carrying the carcasses of their young for days, but Atlantic spotted dolphins seem to mourn their young quickly, long before they start to decompose.

Bottlenosed dolphins, sea otters, harbour seals, apes and elephants are among the animals believed to grieve for dead family members.

Although this is difficult to prove, Dr Alves thinks that Atlantic spotted dolphins join the emotionally intelligent group.

He said he believes that animals such as elephants and pilot wales that spend a lifetime together – sometimes over 60 years – ‘can grieve’.

In spring 2013, the captain of a tourist boat encountered a dolphin carrying her dead calf using her dorsal fin, through the water.

Dave Anderson, who saw the sad event off the coast of Dana Point, California, said he had never seen anything like it in his 20 years at sea.

'Nor have I ever seen anything quite as moving as this mother who refuses to let go of her poor calf,' he wrote on his YouTube channel.

'Did mom start off helping her weak, sick offspring swim to the surface to breathe for days till the tiny dolphin died?

'When will she give up on her calf? Will she continue carrying her deceased on her back until the carcass begins to disintegrate?'

The sad behaviour has been seen before in bottlenosed dolphins, a few of which have been recorded carrying dead calves even after they started to decompose.
