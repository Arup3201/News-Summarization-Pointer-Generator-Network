Iconic gates which once adorned Newcastle United’s St James’ Park are set for a triumphant return home - after being rediscovered in undergrowth on a farm.

The ‘Toon-gates’ were taken down around 14 years ago during a redevelopment at the stadium in 1999 and, for all intents and purposes, lost.

They were put into storage on farmland near Woolsington Hall in Northumberland by the club’s then owner Sir John Hall where they soon became overtaken by the weeds and nettles.

But now they are officially returning 
home to St James’ Park after a campaign by a fans' group, the club and a new sponsor.

Lee
Marshall, PR and supporter liaison manager at Newcastle United said the
gates were taken down when the Milburn stand and Leazes end were 
redeveloped.

He said: 'The gates were taken down 
around 14 years ago when the stadium was redeveloped under Sir John 
Hall’s ownership and they were taken off site to be stored on his 
farmland.

'They’ve been under a few feet of nettles and weeds ever since.

The iconic gates were installed on December 1989 to replace ones which had hung there since 1936.

The wrought iron gates, which bear the club's famous coat of arms, weigh two tonnes and stand 13ft 6ins tall.

They were constructed by local fabricators M Aynsley and Sons based in Heber Street, only a few yards away from the club ground.

'With
the help of our fans, Sir John’s Magpie Group and our sponsors, Wonga, 
we’re delighted to be bringing them home to stand proudly at St James’ 
Park once again.'

The gates
have now been lifted from the garden of Sir John, who owned the club from 1992 until 2007 when he sold his entire 41.6per cent shareholding sports retail magnate, Mike Ashley, for £55 million in a deal that valued the club at £133.1 million.

They will be transported to a dedicated workshop 
where extensive refurbishment work will be undertaken prior to 
installation.

It is anticipated that the gates, 
which are set to be located outside the entrance to the main Milburn 
Stand reception, on Barrack Road, will be unveiled some time before the club's first Premier League home game in early August.

Clear up: The process of cleaning up the recovered gates in time to be reinstated at St James' Park stadium is well underway

An NUFC Fans
United spokesperson, said: 'The re-installation of the gates 
permanently safeguards the feature of St James’ Park as a name and its 
ties to the stadium and city.

'NUFC
Fans United views this as an ongoing and lasting tribute to every 
Newcastle United supporter, player and club official who has ever 
entered the hallowed shrine that is St James’ Park.

'Over
time the gates can become a focal point that all Newcastle United 
supporters, as well as visitors to this great city will embrace.'

Centre of attention: The return of the gates to their rightful place after remaining in undergrowth at Woolsington Hall, Northumberland, has gained huge interest

Homeward bound: The gates are to undergo a thorough renovation before being returned to Newcastle United's St James' Park stadium

Malcolm Dix, on behalf of Sir John 
Hall and the Magpie Group, added: 'We are delighted that the gates will,
in due course, take their rightful place outside the stadium.

'We
sincerely hope that they will become a great attraction for all 
supporters, young and old. They will be a huge attraction for visitors 
to the city and the North East.'

Darryl
Bowman, marketing director, Wonga, said: 'Every fortress needs some 
imposing gates and it’s time for St James’ Park and the fans to be 
reunited with these old friends.

'We
wanted to help as soon as we heard about the exciting plans that were 
being developed between the club and NUFC Fans United and I can’t wait 
to see them reinstated.'
