Given how careful reporters have to be covering Gaza, it was an unfortunate slip-up.

MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski interviewed Israel's ambassador to the U.S. about the crisis, then immediately called her show 'Morning Jew' by mistake.

The Morning Joe host corrected herself instantly, but it was too late as the flub gained traction with journalists and Twitter users.

Slip-up: MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski (left) interviewed Israel's ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer (right) about the crisis in Gaza, then immediately called her show 'Morning Jew' instead of Morning Joe by mistake

Whoops: Brzezinski has been with MSNBC since 2007 and co-hosted the morning show since its inception

The slip-up came at 7.30am yesterday as the host finished interviewing Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S.

Speaking from Washington, he told Brzezinski: 'I can only speak on behalf of the Prime Minister and tell you how much we appreciate what President Obama... has done for the state of Israel.'

The host then cut to talking about a skin cancer crisis before saying: 'Keep it right here on Morning Jew. Joe!'

Twitter's reaction was predictably amused.

Some users called her performance a 'train wreck', some simply put: 'Seriously?' and one user called the experienced 47-year-old presenter a 'nitwit'.

Unamused: Sadly, the cameras did not capture the reaction of Israel's ambassador to the United States

Experienced: The broadcaster, who has spent more than 25 years in TV journalism, was ribbed on Twitter

Most internet users accepted the likelihood that it was an innocent mistake in a difficult job.

But some still pointed to her father's past as Democrat Jimmy Carter's national security advisor and suggested there could be something more sinister at work.

Stephen Kruiser wrote: 'Her dad was a powerful Democrat so she's safe in the (wink-wink) "no bias" mainstream media.'

Brzezinski, who was born and lives in New York, forged her career in ABC and CBS before joining MSNBC seven years ago.
