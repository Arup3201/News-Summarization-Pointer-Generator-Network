This is the adorable moment Mariners pitcher Felix Hernandez's cheeky son picked up a voice recorder and interviewed his father during a press conference.

The Seattle Mariners pitcher was being interviewed after he had finished second in the voting for the AL Cy Young Award yesterday when his five-year-old son Jeremy, who was sitting next to him, got bored.

He then picked up a reporter's voice recorder and pushed it near his father's face, mimicking what he had seen others do hundreds of times before.

Hernandez laughed while his son picked up several different recorders and continued trying to interview his father.

The press conference was held after it was announced Hernandez had lost out on the award to the Cleveland Indians pitcher Cory Kluber.

He told gathered media missing out on the coveted award was difficult to accept.

'I don't know what to say. That was tough,' he said. 'A little disappointed. Just give me more motivation to work harder and harder and be better next year.'

Although Hernandez, from Venezuela, had perhaps the best season of his career, he finished 10 points behind Kluber in the voting.

He previously won the award in 2010, but said he felt he had thrown better this season than he did four years ago.

'I had a great year,' Hernandez said. 'Health, I feel fine the whole year. I think I pitched way better than 2010.'
