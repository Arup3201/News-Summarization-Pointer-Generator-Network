David Cameron today urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to do more to stop the bloodshed in Syria, after failing to make any major progress towards ending the two-year conflict.

Speaking at a press conference in Sochi, the Prime Minister said: 'The history of Syria is being written in the blood of her people.

But Mr Cameron’s visit to the Russian president's summer residence in the Black Sea resort ended with an admission that they still have 'differing views' about how to deal with the situation.

The UK is leading the argument to 
amend or lift restrictions to allow weapons to be passed to forces 
opposed to Bashar Assad's regime.

But Russia has remained supportive of the Syrian government, with Mr Putin determined to defend the country's 'sovereignty'.

Mr Cameron warned the the situation in Syria was 'appalling and deteriorating'.

But
at a press conference after talks with Mr Putin, he added: 'It's no 
secret that we have had differing views on how best to handle the 
situation but we share fundamental aims: to end the conflict, to stop 
Syria fragmenting, to let the Syrian people choose who governs them and 
to prevent the growth of violent extremism.'

In
a thinly-veiled plea to the Russian President, Mr Cameron said: 'We 
urgently have to do more for the sake of the people of Syria to break 
the vicious cycle that threatens to destroy Syria and that threatens to 
export violence and extremism around the world.'

The visit came as details emerged of Britain’s arguments in favour of lifting the arms embargo.

Ahead of his visit Mr Cameron said the atrocities in Syria ‘continue to mount’ and growing evidence that the Asad regime has used chemical weapons.

He told MPs: ‘There is a growing body of limited but persuasive information showing that the regime has used, and continues to use, chemical weapons including sarin. The room for doubt about that continues to diminish.’

Jon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, is providing regular updates to the National Security Council on information that British forces and allies have gleaned.

Russia has previously blocked international moves through the UN security council to impose sanctions on Syria.

However, a leaked document has revealed the UK Government's arguments in favour of easing the EU arms embargo when the sanctions expire at the end of the month.

The British discussion paper sets out 
two options: lift the arms embargo against the Syrian National Coalition
completely, or remove the words ‘non-lethal’ from a list of exemptions,
clearing the way for weapons to be sent to the country.

Carla
Del Ponte, a member of the United Nations panel examining allegations 
of war crimes in Syria, claimed at the weekend that the commission had 
indications that Syrian rebel forces used sarin.

But
Downing Street stands by its assessment that chemical weapons use in 
Syria "is very likely to have been initiated by the regime" and says it 
has ‘no evidence’ of opposition use.

Talks
between US secretary of state John Kerry and the Russian leadership 
this week resulted in plans to convene an international conference on 
Syria later this month.

Mr Cameron is also expected to hold talks in coming days with US president Barack Obama and France's Francois Hollande.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘The UK has taken no decision to arm the Syrian opposition. However, there is likely to be a strong case for further amendments to the EU sanctions regime - or lifting it altogether - if the situation remains as it is, or gets worse.

‘Discussions are continuing in Brussels. We need to find ways to increase pressure on the regime to accept a political solution and ensure we have flexibility to react to the deteriorating situation on the ground.’

More than 70,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011, according to the United Nations.

British and Russian security services have agreed to work together for the first time since the death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko seven years ago, David Cameron announced yesterday.

The announcement came after Russia’s macho president, Vladimir Putin, took the Prime Minister on a helicopter ride high above the Winter Olympic city of Sochi. The stunt was part of an attempt to end years of frosty relations.

After more than three hours of talks at Mr Putin’s Black Sea dacha, Mr Cameron agreed with him that there will be ‘limited cooperation between our security forces’ as Russia prepares to host the Games.

Britain had imposed a ban on secret service co-operation since Russia’s refusal to extradite the main suspect in Litvinenko’s polonium poisoning in London in 2006, MP Andrey Lugovoy, to face murder changes. Now Mr Cameron has agreed that people in both countries are ‘safer and better off’ through more engagement between London and Moscow.

Russia is an ally of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, but Mr Cameron also appeared to win Mr Putin’s support for Russian involvement in moves towards ‘a transitional government that all Syrians can trust to protect them’. There was, however, no clear breakthrough on the issue.

Mr Cameron welcomed Russia’s agreement to convene an international conference to try to find a political solution to Syria’s two-year civil war.
