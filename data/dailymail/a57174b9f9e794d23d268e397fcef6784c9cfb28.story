Tennis fans the world over are used to hearing her deafening shrieks on court.

But Maria Sharapova’s screams yesterday were not during one of her own matches – the former Wimbledon champion was cheering on her new boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov.

And the 22-year-old Bulgarian evidently appreciated the Russian’s noisy support as he triumphed in the first round at the Aegon Championship at the Queen’s Club in West London.

Miss Sharapova’s appearance marks a new step in her budding romance with Dimitrov, currently ranked 28th in the world.

Last month the pair were spotted canoodling in a Madrid street as the 26-year-old women’s world No 3 clung to his arm and rested her head on his shoulder.

Miss Sharapova will be hoping to cheer 
on her new love to even greater success at Queen’s.

Last year, Dimitrov 
reached the semi-final of the event, a traditional warm-up for 
Wimbledon.

Their relationship comes only months after Miss Sharapova announced she had split from her fiancé, Slovenian basketball star Sasha Vujacic.

Speaking at the time, Sharapova said she
hoped they could remain friends but added that her fiancé had been 
unable to return home once in the 10 months that he had been in Turkey, 
making it ‘extremely difficult.’

Sharapova is due to take part in celebrations to mark the 40th 
anniversary of women’s tennis tour at Wimbledon in plans announced 
yesterday.

As part of the list of female Grand Slam champions from the last 40 
years she will appear for the first time alongside the winner from every
other year at a special party on Sunday June 30.

The list, which consists of the sport’s highest profile players, also 
includes Martina Navratilova, Serena Williams and Ana Ivanovic.
