For a truly breathtaking sight, just look to the skies above Utrecht in the Netherlands.

In a video recorded this month, Roald Van Stijn captured thousands of flocking starlings flying in stunning formation.

Although the 36-year-old had been visiting different sites known for starling spotting for three years, every other time he'd attempted to record the beautiful sight, something had got in the way.

The flocks of birds created stunning formations as they 'danced' high above the city skyline

'[Before] it was too dark already or there were too many buildings or trees in the frame,' Van Stijn told MailOnline.

'Many times the starlings just flew as a flock and didn't show the dancing.

'This time I finally got everything right - and even better, it was just five minutes from my home.'

The nature-lover had been visiting the site for three years in hopes of recording a good video of the birds

'This time, I got everything right,' he says. 'And even better, it was just five minutes from my home.'

'Every year the birds flock somewhere else,' he explains.

'This suburb has a flock every year, but normally smaller flocks.

'This flock is really amazing: huge and not that common.' 

While it is common to see starlings in the Netherlands, it's rare to see this many all in one place

Roald Van Stijn says that filming starlings in these optimal conditions was high on his bucket list

'I love the wonders of nature,' Van Stijn says of his passion for amateur outdoor film making.

'Last summer, I finally filmed a lightning strike in super slow motion and last month, I made a timelapse of the Northern Lights. 

'Filming starlings in these conditions was high on my bucket list.'
