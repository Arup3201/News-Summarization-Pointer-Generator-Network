A 12 year-old schoolgirl who has a higher IQ than Einstein has high hopes for the future - she wants to be Prime Minister.

Ophelia Gregory had always been curious about her intelligence after excelling at school.

Last month she decided to travel to London with her mother Kerry where she sat the the Mensa test.

Genius: Kerry Gregory with her daughter Ophelia who has scored 162 on a MENSA test, the highest a person under 18 can get

The pupil was stunned when she discovered she was awarded a mark of 162 - the highest score possible for somebody under the age of 18.

The score puts her into the top one per cent of Britain's brainiest folk and ahead of Prof Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and Albert Einstein who all scored 160.

Ophelia, from Ashford, Kent, said she hoped one day to use her intelligence to reach Number 10.

She said: 'I was just curious to see how smart I was. I was hoping to get into Mensa but I didn't think I would get the top score.

Clever: Ophelia is also a talented violinist and cellist and regularly calls radio programmes to talk about political issues

'I am quite proud. I told some of my friends but only one of them knew what Mensa was and that was because they saw it on The Simpsons.

'There are a few career paths I could follow but I would quite like to be a politician - I plan to go for prime minister.

'I regularly listen to radio programmes and I'm lucky enough to be in a family that discusses political issues.

'I really don't understand the way the country is being run at the moment.'

Talented: Orphelia holding the certificate which shows she has qualified to become a member of Mensa

Ophelia, one of three children, is also a talented violinist and attends Highworth Grammar School.

Her mother Kerry, 43, said: 'We've always been curious about Ophelia and she was up for doing the test.

'She scored higher than Einstein or Stephen Hawking - I don't know where she gets it from.

'She's getting an excellent education anyway, and we're getting help from Mensa, but we hope her school will now support her to reach her full potential.'

Ambitious: Ophelia Gregory, who has scored 162 on a MENSA test, holding a copy of Animal Farm by George Orwell

Father Tom, 45, an business analyst, added: 'Ophelia has always had a great interest in politics and current affairs and likes to call radio talk shows and give her opinions.

'We knew she was smarter than the average 12-year-old from the things she talks about and the questions she asks.

'She's being quite modest but we're very proud of her.'

Ophelia scored 162 on the Cattell IIIB test which is designed to test a person's range of abilities and intelligence and in the UK the average score is 100.

John Stevenage, chief executive of British Mensa Ltd, said: 'Ophelia's score shows she has great potential and we are pleased to welcome her to Mensa.

'We hope she will enjoy being part of the society and interacting with fellow members.'
