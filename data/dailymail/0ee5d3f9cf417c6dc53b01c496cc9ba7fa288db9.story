A SARS-like virus that has killed at least 18 people can be passed between humans, the World Health Organisation now believes.

Yesterday, WHO officials said it seemed likely that the new coronavirus could be transmitted from one person to another, however, they believe that prolonged contact with an infected person is required for transmission to take place.

The virus is from the same family as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that swept the world and killed 775 people in 2003.

Coronavirus emerged in the Gulf last September and has now infected at least 34 people, the majority of whom are in Saudi Arabia.

Last week French authorities confirmed that a 65-year-old French man had been diagnosed with the condition after returning from Dubai.

Yesterday they announced that a second man had been diagnosed with the disease after sharing a hospital room with the original patient.

WHO Assistant Director-General Keiji Fukuda said there was no evidence so far that the virus was able to sustain ‘generalised transmission in communities’ - a scenario that would raise the spectre of a pandemic.

He added: ‘Of most concern is the fact that the different clusters seen in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis that when there is close contact, this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to person.

‘There is a need for countries to increase levels of awareness.’

A public health expert who declined to be identified, said ‘close contact’ meant being in the same small, enclosed space with an infected person for a prolonged period.

Mr Fukuda, part of a WHO team visiting Saudi Arabia to investigate the spread of the disease, said although no specific vaccine or medication was yet available for novel coronavirus, patients were responding to treatment.

‘The care that is taken in the hospitals, in terms of using respirators well, in terms of treating pneumonia, in terms of treating complications, in terms of providing support, these steps can get patients through this very severe illness,’ he said.

A World Health Organisation team are investigating the Al-Moosa hospital in Saudi Arabia where several patients are being treated.

‘One focal point of the investigation at the moment is the hemodialysis unit in the hospital,’ said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl in Geneva, referring to equipment used on kidney and diabetes patients.

‘The association of this outbreak with a single health care facility suggests hospital-acquired transmission,’ he said, noting that some patients under treatment for ailments may have had increased susceptibility to infection.

‘However, the presence of infection in people not associated with the facility itself raises a concern about potential broader transmission in the community,’ he said.
