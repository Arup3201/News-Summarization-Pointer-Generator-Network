Since writing the best-selling book series of all time, Harry Potter, JK Rowling has taken her time over her next literary venture.

But her fans won't have to wait much longer as the cover of her new upcoming book The Casual Vacancy was unveiled today.

The 512-page novel, the writer's first for adults, is about an idyllic town ripped apart by a parish council election.

Not long to wait: JK Rowling's new book for adults The Casual Vacancy is released on September 27

It begins with the unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother, whose demise in his early 40s leaves a space on the parish council.

The new book cover released by publishers Little, Brown doesn't give much else of the plot away though with just a simple ballot box with a cross on the front.

A spokesman for booksellers Waterstones'
said: 'While it is great to see such a bold cover image, it'll cause 
frustration among those desperate to find out more about the plot.

'There
are no clues here. As ever, the JK Rowling guessing game continues.'

The Casual Vacancy isn't released until September 27 but is already set to be a bestseller after many shops have already reported big pre-order demands.

Little Brown said the new book would be a 'blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising' novel.

Rowling
has amassed a fortune estimated to be more than Â£620 million from her 
seven Harry Potter books for children, plus all the spin-off rights.

This will be her first novel since her final Potter book was published in 2007.

The books have sold more than 450 million copies and have been translated into 74 languages.
