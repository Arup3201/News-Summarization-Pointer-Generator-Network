Senator Jeff Flake's son and his young wife have pleaded not guilty to animal cruelty charges after 21 dogs died from heat exhaustion while in their care last summer.

Austin Flake and his wife Logan, both 21, entered their pleas in Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona on Thursday.

'Austin and Logan Flake have declared their innocence,' the Flakes' attorney Dennis Wilenchik said in a statement. 'This was a tragic and unforeseen accident, nothing more.' 

They were acting as caretakers at a dog-boarding facility owned by Logan's parents while the couple, Jesse Todd Hughes and Maleisa Maurine Hughes, were away in Florida.

Sheriff's department investigators concluded that the canines likely died on June 20 from suffocation and heat exhaustion after being confined in a small room that measured eight by 12 foot.

The Hughes told authorities that the air-conditioning was knocked out by a dog chewing through an electrical cord, but the investigators could not confirm that. 

It was unclear how long the power had been off but temperatures reached 100 degrees. 

The next morning, when the bodies of the dogs were found, some of the owners claimed that they were initially told their pets had run away.  

Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, told ABC that her home would never be the same. 

Scene: The dogs were found dead on June 20 and authorities say they died from heat exhaustion

Deadly: It appears that one of the dogs chewed through the air conditioner's cord, switching off the power

Tragic: Questions have also been raised about the cramped conditions (dogs are pictured at the facility)

'It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.' 

A state grand jury also indicted Jesse Todd and Maleisia Hughes each with 22 felony and seven misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals and one count of fraud for the incident.

The couple, who own the Green Acre boarding facility in Phoenix, have pleaded not guilty.

The felony charges carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison, Jerry Cobb, a spokesman for the county attorney's office, told Reuters, although most defendants receive probation in animal cases.

'This is simply the next step in the legal process, and I have confidence in that process,' Senator Flake said in a brief statement last month.

A group of the dog owners also filed a civil lawsuit against the Hughes and the Flakes, accusing them of fraud and neglect.

Mourned: More than 20 dogs passed away in cramped conditions at the boarding facility on June 20

The lawsuit in county Superior Court alleged that the dogs were confined in cramped quarters and faced 'neglect, mistreatment, physical injury and psychological abuse'. 

The dog owners claim that they were told the family would only board a few dogs at a time but a police investigation found more than two dozen dogs were in the small room together.

'Our clients were deceived, attorney John Schill told AZFamily. 'They were told their dogs would be boarded at a Disneyland-type facility, where the dogs would run free.

'In reality, it was 28 dogs crammed into a nine-by-twelve [foot] room, where they died.'

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages but the plantifs have said they aim to shut down the facility.
