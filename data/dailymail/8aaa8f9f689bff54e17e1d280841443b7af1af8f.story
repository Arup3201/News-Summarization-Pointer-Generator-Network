It is a traditional Christmas dessert made with plenty of sugar and chocolate and lashings of cream.

But one eatery in Scotland is putting its own twist on the festive yule log - by selling it deep-fried.

The 950-calorie battered cake is the creation of Rona Johnston and her partner Andrew Mitchell who run Reivers Fish Bar in the Scottish Borders.

The Scottish chippie is also has deep-fried mince pies and Christmas puddings on sale 

With nearly four times as many calories as a conventional yule log, it may not be the healthiest dessert option this Christmas.

The Scottish chippie is also selling deep-fried mince pies and Christmas puddings, to the delight of a demanding public. 

Rona, 50, said the deep-fried treats have been going down well with the customers.

'It seems like it would be a bit too weird, but a deep-fried yule log is very tasty indeed. The customers love it,' she said.

The deep-fried yule log - pictured with Christmas pudding - boasts 950 calories a serving

The fish bar has previously deep-fried Oreo cookies and battered Cadbury's Creme Eggs

Nearly two McDonald's Big Macs  (550 calories each)

Two and a half roast beef sandwiches (360 calories each) 

Nearly four conventional Yule Logs (274 calories each)

119 Brussels Sprouts 

Nine and a half roast potatoes 

Dozen chocolate digestives 

'The cream deliciously melts right into the chocolate sponge.'

The mince pies sell at three for £1, the Christmas pudding is £1.50 and the yule log - their most unusual treat - is £2.50.

Rona, who has been running the shop for the past three years with Andrew, 52, said: 'The mince pies and the puddings are also really popular.

'All the Christmas treats are going down fabulously. We serve each pudding with Scottish cream. They make everything very tasty.'

Reivers Fish Bar previously gained a reputation on account of its deep-fried Oreo cookies, which are available throughout the year, and special battered Cadbury's Creme Eggs for Halloween.

Rona admitted she would try to deep-fry most things, as long as it does not ruin the frying oil.

She said: 'People often come in asking me to fry the strangest things. If it's possible, we'll give it a go.'
