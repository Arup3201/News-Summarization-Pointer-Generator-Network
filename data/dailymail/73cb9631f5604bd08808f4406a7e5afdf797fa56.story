This is how the world reacted in unison to the grand jury verdicts that absolved the killers of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

Millions of Twitter users across six continents lent their voice to the conflict using the rallying hashtags #ICantBreathe, #BlackLivesMatter and #HandsUpDontShoot.

Now, an animated map has documented exactly how the globe lit up with tweets within minutes as each case unraveled.

The start: Shortly before the Ferguson verdict, the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was prevalent in the US and UK

Within hours: That night, when the verdict was announced, the news spread across the world 

Case: Michael Brown, 18, (left) was shot dead by Darren Wilson (right) who was not indicted for the death

The visualization starts on November 24, shortly before a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, refused to indict white police officer Darren Wilson for the fatal shooting of black 18-year-old Michael Brown.

At that point, the protest cry #BlackLivesMatter was most prominent in the east side of the US, with strong reactions from the UK and parts of Europe.

When the judge delivered the verdict, America and Britain erupted with tweets, and the news prompted a faint chain reaction across mainland Europe, southern Asia, Australia, central Africa and central Latin America.

Bubbling anger: The reactions continued to simmer, with the phrase #HandsUpDontShoot in the week after

Brewing: As the Eric Garner verdict neared, six continents lit up with simultaneous reactions

Outrage: Red dots swarmed across the globe as millions tweeted Garner's last words 'I can't breathe'

As the reactions began to simmer a week later, the hashtag #HandsUpDontShoot - which many claimed to be Michael Brown's last actions and words - emerged across most of the US and southern England, with dots scattered across other continents.

On December 3, a grand jury in Staten Island refused to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner.

The news sparked global outrage.

Red spots simultaneously erupted across the map as users tweeted the hashtag #ICantBreathe - the last words Garner said before he died on a New York sidewalk in July.

The map remained clouded by yellow and red dots well into December 4 as the first protests were staged across America. 

Take two: Just a week after the verdict, the officer who killed Eric Garner (left and right) was also absolved
