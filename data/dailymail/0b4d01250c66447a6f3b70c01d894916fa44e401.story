Mental health nurse Michael Miller was banned from working after allegations of maintaining an inappropriate relationship with a patient emerged

A  vile nurse who snuggled up to watch a film with a patient and quipped ‘Sadistic rape and Terry’s Chocolate Orange, what could be better?’ has been banned for a year.

Michael Miller told the vulnerable woman he wanted to molest her, bombarded her with letters and e-mails and arranged to meet her outside work. He has now been sacked from his job at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

During one liaison he asked, ‘What do you think are my chances of getting a s***?'

Miller insisted the allegations against him were fabricated. But a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found a string of charges against him proved and suspended him from the nursing register for 12 months.

Chairman Linda Read said: ‘By pursuing an inappropriate relationship with Miss A, Mr Miller demonstrated an abuse of trust.’

She added: ‘We find most alarming the fact that Mr Miller refers to himself as the party who is vulnerable to that risk.

‘Mr Miller has continued to demonstrate a disregard for Miss A’s welfare.

Miller first met the woman, referred to in the hearing as Miss A, when she was referred to Weald Mental Health Centre in Crawley, West Sussex, after falling victim to a sex attack.

She received treatment between 2006 and 2008. In that time she had one to one sessions with Miller and would talk about her personal problems and her feelings towards being raped.

When she told him she DJed at a local over-30s club he arranged to attend a gig once her therapy was over.

It was at this show, in April 2009, he asked about ‘getting a shag’.

Later Miller - who texted, e-mailed and wrote a letter to Miss A - arranged to spend an evening at Miss A’s house. There they watched a film together.

‘The film was known by both parties to have a rape scene in it and Miss A  left the room when it came on,’ said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC.

Weald Day Hospital was based in Crawley Hospital, though it was run by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust

‘When she returned back into the room with chocolate in her hand he said, “Sadistic rape and Terry’s Chocolate Orange, what could be better?”.’

He then said to her: ‘I keep thinking about trying to molest you but I am scared you will break my jaw?’

Later, he added: ‘Whenever I think about trying to touch you one of the cats keeps getting in the way’.

Miss A was so upset she sent Miller an email telling him she wanted to stop seeing him.

He was found guilty of having an inappropriate relationship with Miss A, making comments of a sexual nature towards her, and making inappropriate comments towards her having knowledge of her history of being abused.

The relationship was said to have occurred between April 2009 and January 2010.

Miller was cleared of plying Miss A with alcohol, making racist comments and dishonestly informing his supervisor that he did not meet Miss A at her house.

A spokesperson for Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said, 'We dismissed Miller when these allegations came to light and reported the case to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. 

'We never tolerate behaviour that crosses professional boundaries and we always take action in this way to safeguard the people who use our services.'
