Nick Clegg yesterday demanded publication of the long-delayed official report into the Iraq War before the general election as relatives of soldiers killed in the conflict complained of ‘the biggest cover-up of our time’.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would be ‘very disappointed’ if the Chilcot Inquiry does not conclude before voters go to the polls next May.

‘I very, very much want to see this Chilcot report published because it is not fair on the relatives,’ Mr Clegg told LBC radio.

‘It is absolutely not fair on those people who lost sons and daughters and loved ones in that conflict that they’re still having to wait to understand how that fateful and in my view utterly wrong decision [to go to war] was taken in the first place.’

Rose Gentle, from Glasgow, who lost her 19-year-old son Gordon in Iraq in 2004, said: ‘If they have nothing to hide, why won’t they publish the report? It’s the biggest cover up of our time.’

Sir John Chilcot was asked to investigate the Iraq War by Gordon Brown in 2009 and last took evidence from a witness three years ago.

David Cameron said last year that he hoped the difficulties surrounding publication of his conclusions would be ‘concluded as soon as possible’.

But the declassification of key documents, and the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process, the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government-commissioned report, has dragged on.

Despite growing anger over the wait for publication of Sir John’s findings, senior Whitehall figures now believe it is now unlikely to see the light of day until after the election.

Unless it is published very early next year, it is thought that it will be judged too politically contentious so close to polling day.

Labour strategists are said to be concerned at the prospect the spectre of Iraq being raised in the months before the election, since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters into the arms of the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010.

Tony Blair, who is expected to be criticised, insisted he has nothing to do with the delay in publication. The inquiry has already been condemned as a whitewash over a deal to keep letters and notes of phone calls between Mr Blair and George W Bush private.

Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has vetoed the release of the correspondence in the run-up to the 2003 conflict, insisting that only their ‘gist’ is included in Sir John’s findings.

In them, Mr Blair is said to have promised the US President: ‘You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I’m with you.’ The official reason for the censorship is that publication would deter prime ministers from speaking freely in private.

But Whitehall sources claim security chiefs and officials in Washington have been firmly against their release.

Sir John said the inquiry now hopes to publish ‘gists and quotes’ from some of the messages. He said this was crucial in order for people to understand his conclusions.

But the letters will not be published in full and any quotes will be kept to the ‘minimum necessary’, and following the protests from the US, no details of Mr Bush’s messages will be published.

Mr Clegg added: ‘I would like to see this report. I would have liked to have seen it published a long time ago. But when this report was set up, quite rightly it was set up entirely independent of politicians.

‘If this was run by politicians people would immediately suspect it to be a stitch-up.

‘Sir John Chilcot will have to explain himself but my understanding, but I very much stress from a distance, is that first the sheer volume of material, millions and millions and millions of documents… they’ve been sifting through that.

‘But then there’s this process which I guess common sense dictates is fair, that those individuals, so the politicians, particularly the politicians of the day in the Labour government of the day that decided on our behalf in my catastrophically and very wrongly to go to war in Iraq, that those individuals who are in any way criticised or commented upon have a right which is fair enough to reply.

‘[But] I very much hope that people who are running the Commission, punctilious though they clearly are being, also feel a heavy weight of responsibility towards the families that they really do need to try and bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible.

‘I mean, every prospective sort of timetable or deadline or publication date appears to have slipped.’
