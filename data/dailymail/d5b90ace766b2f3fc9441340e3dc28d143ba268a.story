For four years, every time a  soldier’s body was returned home, the town’s residents lined the streets in a grateful and dignified tribute to our war dead.

But for Wootton Bassett, the  market town that became a symbol of the nation’s admiration for its Armed Forces, sunset yesterday was the end of an era.

A simple ceremony was held to mark the fact that no more military repatriations will pass through the town.

Ceremony: Hundreds of people took to the streets of Wootton Bassett this evening to mark the end of repatriation ceremonies in the town

Crowded: Residents from the town bowed their heads in prayer during the ceremony which also included speeches from the vicar and mayor

Solemn: Two members of the Royal British Legion wait with their comrades in Wootton Bassett High Street before this evening's ceremony

We will remember them: Members of the Royal British Legion lower their flags during tonight's event

As the bell of St Bartholomew’s Church
chimed, the Union Flag on the high street was lowered and blessed. The 
town’s brass band performed Sunset and Evening and the moving words of 
The Exhortation were read out.

From today, the bodies of British 
troops killed on foreign battlefields will be brought home through RAF 
Brize Norton in Oxfordshire rather than RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. It 
means corteges carrying the flag-draped coffins will no longer travel 
along Wootton Bassett high street – nicknamed the ‘Highway of Heroes’.

Last night’s solemn ceremony was still
tinged by sad news from Afghanistan. The latest serviceman to be killed
there was named as Sergeant Barry Weston, 40, of 42 Commando Royal 
Marines, who was struck by a roadside bomb while on patrol in Helmand 
Province on Tuesday.

Lowered: The standard bearers begin to fold the Union Flag which had flown above the town for the four years since repatriations began

Duty: A group of ex-servicemen lower the Union Flag during the ceremony before it was blessed and folded as the national anthem played

The official folding of the flag is completed before it is passed to another bearer to carry to St Bartholomew's church

Born in Reading and married to Joanne,
he had three daughters, Jasmine, Poppy and newborn Rose. He was 
described by senior officers as ‘selfless and courageous... an ardent 
custodian of the highest standards and finest traditions of the Royal 
Marines’.

In the hours before yesterday’s dusk 
ceremony, David Cameron offered a ‘heartfelt thank you’ to the people of
Wootton Bassett. He said the residents had ‘done our country proud with
the respect and admiration and passion they have shown for our Armed 
Forces and those who have tragically fallen in battle’.

In recognition of its role, the 
Wiltshire town will be renamed Royal Wootton Bassett later this year. 
The bodies of 345 service personnel have passed through the town since 
April 2007. It fell silent for the 167th and final time as the body of 
Lieutenant Daniel Clack, 24, of 1st Battalion The Rifles, was brought 
home last month.

Initially, just a few members of the 
Royal British Legion stopped and bowed their heads as the funeral 
corteges passed through. But spontaneously the ritual grew, until 
hundreds lined the high street to pay their respects. Dr Peter 
Caddick-Adams, a military expert at Cranfield University, said: ‘They’ve
taught us the meaning of sacrifice, and I think we’d forgotten that.’

The town’s Union Flag will be taken to a memorial garden at  RAF Brize Norton for future repatriations.

Tragic: Lieutenant Daniel Clack was the last soldier to be repatriated through Wootton Bassett, while Sergeant Barry Weston, who had three young daughters, Jasmine, Poppy and Rose, will be the first whose coffin travels through Clacerton after his death in Afghanistan on Tuesday
