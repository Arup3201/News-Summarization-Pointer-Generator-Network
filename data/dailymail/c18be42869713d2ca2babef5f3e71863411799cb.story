Nigel Farage yesterday said he felt ‘awkward’ when he could hear no English being spoken while on a train from London to Kent.

The Ukip leader described how he was on his way home when he went several stops without hearing his native tongue.

His comments followed a provocative speech in which he claimed some areas of Britain are being ‘taken over’ by migrants, while others have become ‘frankly unrecognisable’. They came a day after figures showed a significant rise in net migration.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage boasted that his party would cause a 'political earthquake' by topping the polls in May's European Parliament elections

Ukip unveiled its new 'Love Britain' slogan at the conference in Torquay but it was used in 2010 by the BNP

Speaking to journalists at his party’s annual conference in Torquay, Mr Farage said: ‘It was rush hour, from Charing Cross, it was the stopper going out. We stopped at London Bridge, New Cross, Hither Green.

‘It wasn’t until after we got past Grove Park that I could actually hear English being audibly spoken in the carriage. Does that make me feel slightly awkward? Yes.

‘I wonder what’s really going on. And I’m sure that’s a view that will be reflected by three quarters of the population, perhaps even more.’

Mr Farage insisted he was not anti-immigration but said Britain should be able to limit the ‘quality and quantity’ of migrants. While he denied wanting people to be forced to speak English, he said the challenge of integration was ‘very, very important’.

Earlier, the Ukip leader attacked the main political parties for allowing ‘open door immigration’ and said this was not the legacy he wanted to leave to ‘our children and grandchildren’.

In his address to the 800-strong audience, he claimed he was leading a ‘patriotic fightback’ against the EU.

He predicted his party could win the European elections and pick up support in the local council elections, both in May. He even claimed he will have ‘failed’ if Ukip wins no Westminster seats at the General Election next year – and that he might resign if this happens.

Mr Farage said eight in ten British people believed unrestricted immigration was ‘irresponsible’. He linked it to a doubling of youth unemployment since 2004.

Mr Farage said there were 84 days until Ukip would trigger a 'political earthquake' by coming top in the European elections

This has a ‘social price’, he added. ‘The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognisable.

'Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don’t hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.’

The conference, with a large international media presence, was blighted by a gaffe in which a Ukip member asked: ‘How can you possibly be a Muslim and an Englishman?’

He addressed the question to Ukip small business spokesman Amjad Bashir, and was told by officials that his views were not in line with the  party’s policy.

Mr Farage was also embarrassed yesterday when it emerged his ‘Love Britain, Vote Ukip’ slogan echoes one used by the British National Party. It has promoted itself with ‘Love Britain, Vote BNP’ for several years.

BNP leader Nick Griffin accused Ukip of stealing ‘our slogan and our policies’. Mr Farage tried to shrug off the association, saying people still fly the Union Flag which is also used by the far Right.

But the debacle is embarrassing given the lengths to which he has gone to distance himself from the BNP, including banning former members from joining his party.

Immigration figures this week showed a large increase in net migration to 212,000 last year, most of it from debt-stricken southern Europe.

Mr Farage claimed Ukip had made discussing immigration 'respectable'
