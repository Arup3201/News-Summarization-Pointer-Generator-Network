Praised: One of the MoS exclusives on the Leveson Inquiry

The Mail on Sunday last week scooped one of the  newspaper industry’s most coveted honours, being named Sunday Newspaper of the Year at the London Press Club awards.

Judges praised the MoS for providing ‘more scoops, more must-read columnists and a series of riveting exposés’.

The Mail on Sunday triumphed over a shortlist of titles that included both the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph.

Our scoops that the judges so admired included a series of sensational exclusives about the Leveson Inquiry  by Political Editor Simon Walters – while our must-read columnists include Liz Jones, Rachel Johnson, Peter Hitchens, Piers Morgan, James Forsyth, Patrick Collins, Gary Neville and Chris Evans.

The award was presented at a lunch at the City of London’s Stationers Hall in recognition of the paper’s performance in 2012, the first year under its fifth editor, Geordie Greig.

The panel  of distinguished judges said he had a ‘radical if subtle blueprint for the paper’.

During the year, we exposed and campaigned tirelessly about the mass closures  of hospital accident and emergency departments.

We also serialised the books of Salman Rushdie, Rod Stewart, Delia Smith and Pippa Middleton – while You magazine offered celebrity shoots and interviews with One Direction, the Kardashian sisters, Charlize Theron, Leona Lewis and Myleene Klass.

The judges also praised the paper’s commercial success, with circulation at 1.7 million and market share and profits increasing.

This year the story continues, with the launch of Event, our brand new culture, celebrities  and critics magazine. 

That’s true quality and success on Sunday!
