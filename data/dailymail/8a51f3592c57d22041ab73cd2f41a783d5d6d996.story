Emotions were running high at the Baltimore Ravens/ New England Patriots game on Sunday night and a fan chant of 'Bullsh*t,' aired live on NBC during primetime, had some saying the network had violated FCC standards.

The expletive eruption from Ravens fans, enraged by non other than the league's replacement refs, was just one in a series of incidents at the NFL match at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore - including a random fan in a cape rushing the field and both coaches being punished for belligerence toward the infamous replacement refs.

Baltimore enthusiasts cried out 'Bullsh*t' in the game's fourth quarter, when Ravens coach John Harbaugh received a penalty for 'unsportsmanlike behavior' when he knocked into a ref as he tried to call a time-out.

The clearly comprehended curse word was repeated by the audience for several moments and though 
the FCC initially said they were looking into whether NBC was negligent in airing the taunts 
during their coverage on Sunday Night Football, the agency now says there won't be a fine.

'It's the loudest manure chant I've ever heard,' NBC sportscaster Al 
Michaels said during the coverage in response to the audience chant against the refs, who 
have been the object of ridicule by fans and NFL coaches alike.

The FCC, headed by Julius 
Genachowski, typically won't punish a network for a 'fleeting expletive'
but since the shouts on Sunday were easily heard and lasted for several
minutes, some thought the Peacock Network could face a fine.

But a FCC representative told TMZ, 'There’s never been any penalties imposed for obscenities inadvertently heard over air.'

And a Ravens rep was equally nonplussed by the incident.

'We’re
certainly aware of it. Normally, our crowd is one of the most 
enthusiastic and respectful home audiences in all of sports,' Senior 
Vice President of Public and Community Relations for the franchise, 
Kevin Byrne, said.

Random: A fan rushed the field on Sunday at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore donning a cape with the head of comedian and talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres. He said the stunt was to support anti-bullying causes

After
the game, the coach claimed he accidentally bumped into the ref when he 
was trying to get the man's attention to call a time-out.

'I
guess I didn't understand how he interpreted it, but what we're told is
to get the timeout where they can see it in front of their face in 
those situations,' Harbaugh, 50, told reporters after the game.

'That's
what I've been told for five years going into this game. I think he 
took it as bumping him. I didn't mean to bump him. I wanted to call a 
timeout, so I apologize for bumping, but the intent was to call a 
timeout.'

But Sunday's coach/ref scuffles are just the latest in the replacement ref controversy.

The
NFL locked out the regular officials this June, after their contract 
expired, and negotiations with the NFL Referees Association over salary 
and benefits have yielded little progress.

This is the first time since 2001 that backups have been called in and fans, coaches and players have been complaining that the substitutes are not passing muster.

Sunday's game seemed like a comedy of errors - starting with a streaking fan whose mission who strutted his stuff but all in the name of charity, he claims.

The
intruder, Mark Harvey, stormed the field donning a cape emblazoned with
the face of Ellen DeGeneres, a baseball cap and briefs, in footage uploaded to YouTube, in order 
to raise awareness of the dangers of bullying.

Harvey has pulled this stunt before, at an Orioles game in April, and he even has a website to raise awareness for his anti-bullying efforts.

After the streaking side-show and the call against Harbaugh ignited the crowd, a last minute move by the Ravens further set off a coach, this time for the opposing team.

The
Ravens ended up winning the game by 31-30 but only after Baltimore 
rookie Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal that barely landed 
within bounds.

Refs ruled Tucker's goal was in but the Patriots weren't having in. 

Patriots
coach Bill Belichick openly questioned the ruling and grabbed a ref by 
the arm, angrily opposing what he called an arbitrary ruling, as the official walked off the field.

The incident could earn Belichick a fine but he played down the controversy at a post-game press conference.

'That's
what we're going to try to work on. Talk to the officials about the way
they called the game. Talk to the league about the way they called it. I
don't know. But we just have to go out there and try to play the best 
we can,' he said.

If he is fined, he won't be the first coach to face a punishment for appealing a ref's decision this season.

Denver
Broncos coach John Fox and Atlanta Falcons coach Jack Del Rio were 
slapped with a league fine of $20,000 for arguing with officials on the 
sidelines last Monday.

With
the ref controversy playing out, the NFL released a 
statement last week in support of the replacements - praising them for 
'performing admirably' and telling coaches and players that abuse of the
field officials won't be tolerated.

'Officiating
is never perfect. The current officials have made great strides and are
performing admirably under unprecedented scrutiny and great pressure. 
As we do every season, we will work to improve officiating and are 
confident that the game officials will show continued improvement,' the 
statement said.

In mourning: Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith, whose 19-year-old brother died over the weekend, chose to play despite his personal tragedy. He scored two touchdowns for the Ravens on Sunday

'I don't care what the league fines me, these [replacement] refs are terrible,' one unnamed NFL head coach told ESPN.

On a somber note, the Ravens community savored Sunday's victory in support of their wide receiver Torrey Smith.

Smith's
19-year-old brother, Tevin Jones, was killed in a motorcycle accident 
over the weekend and he chose to still proceed in the game and ended
up scoring two touchdowns for his team.

'It
was tough emotionally. I didn't know how I would hold up. I was telling
my teammates a minute ago that this is new territory for me personally.
I never really had to deal with a death in the family, let alone my 
brother. It's part of life and, due to my teammates and my family and 
friends, I'll be able to get over it,' he told The Baltimore Sun after 
the game.
