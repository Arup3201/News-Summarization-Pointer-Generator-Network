An Arkansas teenager's attempt to obtain a driving license landed him in jail after he was charged with driving to the test site without one and then smashing into a state trooper's patrol car and a house when questioned about it by police.

Cops in Arkansas finally arrested the tearaway who led officers on a car chase after he drove from the state road test facility, worried he was going to be in big trouble with the law for driving without a license.

The teen showed up to take the test at the Arkansas State Police facility in Jonesboro.  

End of the road: Officers chased Wright in a high-speed pursuit where he veered off the road and into a yard before he crashed into a house
