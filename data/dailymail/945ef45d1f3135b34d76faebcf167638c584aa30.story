Legal woes: The Department of Justice joined a civil fraud lawsuit against Lance Armstrong filed by his former teammate

Lance Armstrong will now have to answer to the Department of Justice for using performance-enhancing drugs during the Tour de France.

The agency told a federal court Friday that it has joined a civil fraud suit filed two years ago by Armstrong's former teammate Floyd Landis under the False Claims Act, according to NBC News.

U.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart wrote Attorney General Eric Holder on January 14, urging him to join the civil case and telling Holder that ‘fraud and other crimes were committed’ by Armstrong and other members of his former U.S. Postal Service teams.

The letter is dated the same day Armstrong admitted his drug use to Oprah Winfrey in a television interview that was broadcast on January 17 and 18.

The civil suit argues that because Armstrong’s team used banned drugs and blood transfusions, they violated their sponsorship agreement with the Postal Service.

The USPS spent around $30million backing Armstrong's cycling team. Under the False Claims Act, the government can recover three times that amount in damages, bringing the total to nearly $100million, USA Today reported.

A quarter of that sum could go to Landis for his role as the whistle-blower who was among the first to publicly accuse Armstrong of cheating.

Besides Armstrong, the suit also names his agent, Bill Stapleton, Stapleton's agency and the cycling team's management company, Tailwind Sports.

In response, Armstrong’s attorney Robert Luskin released a statement challenging the premise that the government was defrauded.

‘Lance and his representatives worked constructively over these last weeks with federal lawyers to resolve this case fairly, but those talks failed because we disagree about whether the Postal Service was damaged,’ Luskin said.

‘The Postal's Services own studies show that the Service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship -- benefits totaling more than $100million.’

Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title for using illegal substances, accuses Armstrong of committing fraud against the Postal Service, which sponsored most of Armstrong's teams as the star rider used PEDs to win the Tour a record seven times.

Landis also was a key witness in a USADA investigation last year that exposed Armstrong's doping. He stands to collect a portion — potentially millions of dollars — of any possible financial penalties against Armstrong.

USADA officials had been urging Armstrong to speak under oath with its investigators if he hoped to have his lifetime ban reduced.

Tygart’s letter was first reported Thursday by Velonews.com and The Associated Press independently obtained a copy from a person familiar with the case.

Armstrong and USADA officials talked on and off over a couple of months about the terms of the cyclist sitting down for a long interview to spill all he knows about doping in cycling, but Armstrong said Wednesday he would not cooperate.

A source familiar with discussions between the two sides said among the topics was how much protection USADA could provide Armstrong in the whistle-blower case and against possible criminal action.

The cyclist and his attorneys ultimately were not satisfied with USADA's offer, the person said.

In commenting Wednesday on Armstrong's refusal to talk, Tygart said that, ‘over the last few weeks he has led us to believe that he wanted to come in and assist USADA, but was worried of potential criminal and civil liability if he did so.’

In his letter to Holder, Tygart wrote that USADA ‘uncovered one of the greatest frauds in the history of sport’ but that his agency had reached the end of what it can do to punish Armstrong and other ‘non-sports’ people involved with his teams.

‘Fraud and other crimes were committed,’ Tygart wrote, telling Holder that the case involved drug trafficking, federal witness intimidation and that other federal agencies have gathered more information.

‘USADA has already done the work in the sports case and won,’ Tygart wrote.

Coincidence: The head of USADA sent a letter to the Justice Department asking the agency to join the suit against Armstrong the same day the cyclist had admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey

Armstrong was the subject of a two-year federal grand jury investigation that was dropped a year ago without an indictment.

Tygart also told Holder that the Justice Department joining the case against Armstrong would be viewed favorably by the public and the media.

The letter noted the federal government recently went after Landis for defrauding donors to his defense fund back when he still denied doping to win the 2006 Tour de France.

Tygart called the doping by Armstrong and the Postal Service teams a ‘massive economic fraud’ that ‘absolutely dwarfs anything Landis did.’

However, the government’s case against Armstrong is far from airtight. The disgraced cyclist's defense team could argue that the sponsorship deal with USPS did not expressly forbid team members from using blood transfusions during races.

Another major hurdle for the DOJ would be proving that Armstrong had defrauded the government out of millions of dollars.

The cyclist’s attorneys would likely claim that not only did the Postal Service not lose money by backing the USPS team, but that in fact the agency came away with about $100million in value from media exposure.

Earlier this week, after more than two months of negotiations, Armstrong attorney Tim Herman said that the cyclist won't speak to USADA about doping in cycling, calling it a process designed 'only to demonize selected individuals.'

Refusal: Lance Armstrong won't interview under oath with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which may have been his only chance at ending his lifetime ban from cycling

Armstrong had previously said he was willing to participate in an international effort to clean up a sport that is based mostly in Europe.

For years, Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs.

But last year, USADA released a report that detailed extensive doping on his seven Tour de France-winning teams and stripped him of those titles.

Armstrong then admitted last month in an
interview with 'Queen of Talk' Oprah Winfrey that he doped and used 
performance-enhancing drugs to win those races.

'We remain hopeful that an international
effort will be mounted and we will do everything we can to facilitate 
that result,' Mr Herman said in a statement.

Defense strategy: Armstrong's lawyers will likely argue that the cyclist had never expressly promised not to use blood transfusions, and that the Postal Service actually came away with $100million in value from the sponsorship deal

'Lance will not participate in USADA's efforts to selectively conduct American prosecutions that only demonize selected individuals while failing to address the 95 per cent of the sport over which USADA has no jurisdiction.'

Armstrong is facing several legal challenges, and testifying under oath to USADA could have exposed him to further troubles.

Armstrong also has been sued by a Dallas-based SCA Promotions to recover more than $12million in bonuses.

He also has been sued to by The Sunday Times in London to recover a libel judgment that Armstrong won against the paper.
