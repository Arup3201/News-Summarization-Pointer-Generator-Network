British taxpayers are underwriting a multi-million-pound loan to help China plant trees as part of a project to tackle climate change.

The Treasury has agreed to a European Union scheme to help the country grow forests to compensate for its contribution to global warming.

The Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank – of which the Chancellor is a governor – has lent China  £210million (250million euros) to kickstart the project.

Britain has agreed to underwrite the loan, covering 16p in every pound that is not paid back should the debt turn toxic – which would cost us more than £30million.

While EU member states – which are the EIB’s shareholders – are mired in trillions of pounds of debt and sluggish growth, China is now the second largest economy in the world and continues to expand by 2 per cent a year.

India and Brazil are among other countries with surging economies to receive similar EU anti-climate change loans in the past 12 months.

Since last year, the deals have seen the UK taxpayer loaded with an extra £920million of liabilities.

The British government has announced plans to stop sending aid to China. But, through the EIB, we will still be underwriting loans to the country for years to come.

Last night, critics expressed amazement that the UK was helping China plant trees – saying the move could harm our economy.

Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘As a result of ridiculous climate change policies at home, we are seeing industries relocating to China because energy here is becoming so expensive.

‘And yet at the same time as we are exporting industry, it turns out we are helping them curb their own climate change emissions.

‘You couldn’t make this up – it’s like a late April Fools.’

He added: ‘This is what happens when you’re controlled by a supranational body like the European Union. We want to make our own decisions.’ 

Roger Helmer MEP, industry spokesman for UKIP, said: ‘The revelations that the UK is underwriting nearly £1billion for climate change packages in the last year alone is staggering.

That we are sending hundreds of millions off to Brazil, India and China to plant trees and the like is quite simply absurd.’ The Chinese deal was struck last month between Beijing and the EIB, which borrows money from the markets to lend out.

A total of £210million (250million 
euros) will support eight forestry projects, which will involve the 
planting of millions of trees to soak up industrial carbon emissions.

The
loan comes in the wake of two others to China totalling £460million 
(550million euros) for ‘green’ energy schemes in 2007 and 2010. China’s carbon dioxide emissions rose 10 per cent in 2010 to 8.33billion tons – a quarter of the global total.

Meanwhile Britain is backing more investment to India through the EIB. Last summer, it lent £167million (200million euros) to Mumbai-based financial giant ICICI Bank to distribute to renewable energy projects and has since approved another £82million (100million euros).

This comes despite India recently telling the UK that it doesn’t need the £1.1billion of foreign aid London is sending there over the next four years, describing it as ‘a peanut’.

And, in October, the government of Brazil – where annual growth is 5 per cent – was given a £418million (500million euros) loan to support undefined ‘green’ schemes.

In all, since the start of 2011, the EIB has paid out 66 loans worth a total of £5.4billion (6.4billion euros) in a bid to fight climate change.

The EIB insisted that the risk to the British taxpayer was a remote one.

A spokesman said: ‘We perform due diligence to ensure that all projects are economically and financially viable, technically adequate and in compliance with the Bank’s environmental and social requirements.

But Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘The true purpose of EIB loans is to buy the loyalty of the contractors, consultants and middle-men that feed off the system.’
