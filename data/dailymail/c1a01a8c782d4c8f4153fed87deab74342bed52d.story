The web was awash last week of claims that Apple’s latest iPhone 6 Plus handset bends when stored in a pocket too long. 

However, experts from Consumer Reports suggest that some of these claims may have been exaggerated.

During their own stress tests, they found the iPhone 6 Plus can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the HTC One (M8) and the smaller iPhone 6.

Consumer Reports used a ‘three-point flexural’ device (pictured) to put the handsets through a stress test. Despite claims made last week that the iPhone 6 Plus bends easily when left in a pocket too long, the phone outperformed the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 - and was able to withstand more force than previously claimed

This chart reveals how much force each handset could withstand. 

'Deformation' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend. 

'Case separation' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case.

The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape.

YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times.

To put these claims to the test, Consumer Reports used a so-called ‘three-point flexural test.’

This involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device.

The set-up is said to be similar to the one Apple uses to test its devices before selling them.

In addition to the iPhone 6 Plus, the researchers tested the iPhone 6, HTC One (M8), LG G3, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and the iPhone 5.

Despite the claims, the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 were the weakest devices.

They started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied.

The iPhone 6 Plus came third, at 90lbs (40kg), followed by the LG G3 and iPhone 5 on 130lbs (59kg), and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on 150lbs (68kg).

The iPhone 6 Plus results show the handset can withstand 15lbs (6.8kg) more force than the initial reports suggested.

Consumer Reports claimed this is more than a quarter more force than is needed to break three pencils.

'Impressively, despite some serious damage from our machine, some of the phones continued to work,' said Consumer Reports. 

'Several of the screens illuminated and were functional to the touch; we even completed a call from one phone to another.

'While nothing is (evidently) indestructible, we expect that any of these phones should stand up to typical use.'

Apple also faced criticism and complaints last week about its iOS 8.0.1 update, after it caused problems with the new phones’ TouchID sensors and data services.

The update was pulled, and the problems should now be solved by updating to iOS 8.0.2.

Further tests, by AnandTech, revealed the performance of the new phones isn’t as poor as customers have made out, either. 

During initial benchmark tests, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus. 

The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1.

The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4.

According to Consumer Reports, the HTC One (M8) (pictured) was the weakest of the handsets tested. It started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. This was on par with the iPhone 6. The HTC handset separated from its case when a force of 90lbs (40kg) was applied

The controversy was dubbed 'BendGate'. It led to internet jokers posting photos, mocking the unintended new feature (pictured). A number of these images went viral on social media

Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested.

Following the reports, and #bendgate controversy on Twitter, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,'

Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 (£60.26) Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion (£14.1billion) in market value.
