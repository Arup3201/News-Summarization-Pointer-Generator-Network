You might worry about being called Scrooge if you serve a 25p mince pie at a Christmas party.

But it seems that the budget pastries from Iceland are the best money can buy this festive season – beating high street rivals and even luxury versions from Harrods and Fortnum & Mason in blind taste tests.

Food experts voted Iceland’s pies the best in an annual review of Christmas food, praising their ‘crumbly buttery pastry’ that was ‘generously filled with sweet, fruity mincemeat’. And at just £1.50 for a pack of six, the store’s Deluxe Mince Pies cost a fraction of those sold by their more exclusive rivals.

A pack from Fortnum & Mason in London, which came in fifth place, costs eight times more at £12.95, while Harrods’s Luxury Almond and Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 were down in twelfth position.

Iceland’s buying director Nigel Broadhurst said: ‘We are delighted but not surprised to have been awarded the accolade for Britain’s best mince pie.

‘Many families are mindful of their budget over the festive period, but still want to enjoy good food. This award demonstrates that you can achieve both when shopping with Iceland.’

The accolade, in this year’s Good Housekeeping Institute Tried And Tested Christmas special, revealed the success of the British grocer in fighting back against the success of German giants Aldi and Lidl.

The discount stores, which usually dominate the Christmas competition, struggled this year: Aldi did not make the top three in any of the 12 festive food and drink categories assessed by the Institute, which included stuffing, smoked salmon and brandy butter.

Lidl claimed only one top spot, in the Stilton category, with its £1.69 Valley Spire Mature Blue Stilton.

In a surprise victory, Tesco, which has recently suffered a sharp fall in sales, won the best pud award with its £5 nine-month matured cherry topped Christmas pudding – described by judges as ‘well spiced, moist and full of flavour’.

It beat 34 other entries, including a £24.95 classic version from Harrods, which was in 13th place.

And Tesco, which has spent millions of pounds on improving the quality of its goods, also came in second for its Christmas Cake, cranberry sauce and stilton, and third for its yule log, stuffing and own label mulled wine. Marks & Spencer was crowned the king of Christmas, winning three first place awards – a quarter of the categories – with its Christmas Cake, turkey and cranberry sauce.

Caroline Bloor, of Good Housekeeping, said: ‘Our top scorers show that price is no indicator of deliciousness. By comparing a wide range of foods, we can really say which tastes best and pass that knowledge on to shoppers.’
