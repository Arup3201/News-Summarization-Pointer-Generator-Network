Awosogba was pronounced dead at about 3.15pm at New Brunswick's Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

A university spokesman said there is no indication of foul play and a cause of death has not been determined but the teen's sister, a resident physician in Boston, says her brother may have had an undiagnosed heart condition, FOX News reports.

'We don't know yet what happened,' she said. 'But based on what one of his friends told us, it seems to have been a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.'

Heart Condition: A cause of death has not been determined but the teen's sister (center), a resident physician in Boston, says her brother may have had an undiagnosed heart condition.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the heart muscles become abnormally thick, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood.

The disease often goes undiagnosed because many with the disease show few, if any, symptoms, according to the Mayo Clinic. A common misdiagnosis is asthma. 

'His friend told us he looked unwell, uncomfortable,' Temitope said. 'He went to get a drink of water, then collapsed.'

Awosogba, known as 'BJ' or 'Banji' to his friends, played basketball and baseball throughout his childhood and teen years, He entered the university's School of Arts & Sciences in fall 2014, he did not have a declared major.

Chris Kenney, head baseball coach at East Brunswick High School, where Awosogba attended and played on the team, described the student as 'such a sweet kid,' according to NJ.com. 

'I loved having him on the team, Kenney said. 'I loved talking to him. Extremely smart. He was one kid I never had to worry about.' 

Awosogba's death is the second the university has seen since the beginning of the new year.
