England captain Chris Robshaw has been ruled out of Harlequins' European Rugby Champions Cup match against Leinster on Saturday and will see a specialist to examine his shoulder injury.

The 28-year-old flanker sustained the blow against the same opposition on Sunday, when he helped Harlequins to a 24-18 victory at the Twickenham Stoop.

Harlequins have given no early indication of how long they expect to be without Robshaw, but expect to be in a position later in the week to provide greater detail.

They will also be without fly-half Nick Evans for the trip to Dublin.

Harlequins said in a statement: 'Harlequins today confirmed that both Chris Robshaw and Nick Evans will be unavailable for Saturday's European Rugby Champions Cup match against Leinster at the Aviva Stadium, due to injuries sustained in the round 3 match at The Stoop.

'Evans, who was replaced after 11 minutes, is expected to return next week against Newcastle Falcons.

'Robshaw will have further assessments with a specialist on a shoulder injury. A further update will be given towards the end of the week.'
