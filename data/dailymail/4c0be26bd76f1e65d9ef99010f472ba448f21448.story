Testimony: Ms Diallo told ABC News's Robin Roberts she had made 'mistakes', but that shouldn't stop prosecutors from going ahead

The hotel maid who claims she was sexually assaulted in a New York hotel room by former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn has admitted she has lied about being assaulted in the past.

Breaking her silence for the first time, Nafissatou Diallo said she made a 'mistake' when lying about an alleged gang-rape in her home country Guinea to gain asylum to the U.S. - but insisted that didn't mean she wasn't attacked by Strauss-Kahn.

'I have made a mistake,' she said. 'But that doesn't mean this man didn't try to rape me. He tried to rape me.'

The maid claims she had no idea who Strauss-Kahn was, and that when she realised he was tipped to be the next French president she was convinced 'they're going to kill me so no-one knows'.

The 32-year-old alleges Strauss-Kahn appeared naked in front of her when she opened the door to his suite and he started to act like 'a crazy man',  grabbing her breasts and then forcing her to perform a sex act on him.

She told Newsweek she has chosen to waive her right to anonymity so that people know the truth about what happened in Strauss-Kahn's luxury suite on May 14, but his lawyers claim she is running a 'media campaign' to convince prosecutors her version of events is true.

She has come forward just a week 
before a crucial hearing in which prosecutors will reveal whether they 
will drop the charges or continue with the case after weeks of 
deliberation.

The case 
appeared to teeter on the verge of collapse on July 1, when the 
assistant district attorney admitted there were 'serious credibility 
issues' with Ms Diallo, who is said to have lied to prosecutors and on 
asylum application forms in the past.

Strauss-Kahn's lawyers claim she has gone public in a last-ditch attempt to convince prosecutors she is telling the truth, but she says she simply wants justice.

Ms Diallo, who is known as 'Nafi', told ABC News : 'I never want to be in public but I have no choice. Now, I have to be in public. I have to, for myself. I have to tell the truth.'

'I want justice. I want him to go to jail,' she said in the interview on Sunday. 'I want him to know that there is some places you cannot use your money, you cannot use your power when you do something like this.'

She said that she hopes God punishes the man, who had been tipped as the next French president. 'We are poor, but we are good,' she said. 'I don't think about money.'

Accused: Ms Diallo said that she wants former IMF boss Strauss-Kahn to be sent to jail

The hotel maid said that she did not 
know her alleged attacker's high profile until she watched the morning 
news the day after the incident.

'I
watched Channel 7 and they say this is [the] guy, I don’t know, and he 
is going to be the next president of France. And I think they are going 
to kill me,' she told Newsweek.

Ms Diallo said that she is angry at 
claims published in The New York Post that she was working as at least a
part-time prostitute.

'Because of him they call me a prostitute,' said Ms Diallo, who is currently suing the newspaper.

The interviews with Newsweek and ABC
News mark the first time the 32-year-old Guinean immigrant has been 
publicly identified since she shocked the world with allegations that 
Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from the bathroom of his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel on May 
14 and forced her to perform oral sex.

Manhattan District Attorneys are 
currently considering whether drop the sexual assault charges against 
Strauss-Kahn amid concerns about the hotel maid's credibility.

Ms Diallo admitted that she had made 'mistakes' but said that should not stop prosecutors from going forward.

'God is my witness I'm telling the truth. From my heart. God knows that. And he knows that,' she told ABC News.

Speaking about the alleged assault, 
she said she saw Strauss-Kahn appear naked in front of her when she 
opened the door to his suite. He was like 'a crazy man to me,' she said.

She said: 'I was like, I'm so sorry, I turned my head, he come to me and grabbed my breasts, "no you don't have to be sorry".'

'You're beautiful,' she reported Strauss-Kahn as saying, and said he attacked her despite her protestations.

'I said, "Sir, stop this. I don't want to lose my job". He said, "You're not going to lose your job",' Ms Diallo said.

'I push him. I get up. I wanted to 
scare him. I said, "Look, there is my supervisor right there",' she told Newsweek.

But Strauss-Kahn said no-one was there to hear.

She
told ABC: 'I was like stop, stop, stop this, but he keep pushing me, 
pushing me to the hallway, keep pushing me back to the hallway, I was so
afraid, I was so scared.'

Ms Diallo alleges he went on to pull up her uniform dress, tear down her 
pantyhose, grab her indecently, then grip her head and force her to 
perform a sex act on him.

Strauss-Kahn, 62, has repeatedly denied all the charges against him. In a statement on Sunday, his lawyers called the interview a last-ditch effort by the maid and her lawyers to extract money from him.

She is 'the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges against a person from whom she wants money,' lawyers Benjamin Brafman and William Taylor said.

'Her lawyers and public relations 
consultants have orchestrated an unprecedented number of media events 
and rallies to bring pressure on the prosecutors in this case after she 
had to admit her extraordinary efforts to mislead them.'

Ms Diallo's lawyers responded, saying Strauss-Kahn's lawyers 'have conducted an 
unprecedented smear campaign against the victim of a violent sexual 
attack'.

Her attorney Kenneth Thompson noted that the defence team have said whatever happened in the suite was
not forced.

'We are dealing with a brutal sexual 
attack, a mountain of physical evidence, a victim who spoke out 
immediately, and numerous corroborating witnesses,' Mr Thompson said.

The lawyer told MailOnline she had not been paid for either interview, and had received 'not one dime, not one penny'. It has not yet been determined whether she will speak out further.

He said his client had made the decision to come forward herself to clear her name, after the New York Post accused her of being a prostitute.

A spokesman for ABC said there were no restrictions on the interview, and when asked whether a licensing fee was paid to secure it told Media Bistro: 'Absolutely not'.

The interview comes after Ms Diallo's overall credibility was thrown into question when Manhattan prosecutors revealed that she had told authorities numerous lies, including fabricating a story about being gang-raped in Guinea in order to gain U.S. asylum.

She also changed details of her story about what happened following the purported assault.

Ms Diallo, who has been kept in hiding with her 15-year-old daughter for weeks since the allegations, said that she wants to return to work in hotel, but would prefer to go to the laundry where she would not have to meet guests rather than continue as a maid.
