There is something magical about the No 10 shirt. Something mystical. Spiritual almost. It is the shirt of the World Cup gods. The shirt of the Hand of God. The shirt of god-given football talent.

Wear it in the heavenly tradition and immortality can beckon.

Here in Brazil a veritable host are knocking on the door of No 10. Seeking the power.

Most of you can name them: Neymar, Messi, Benzema.

Yes, and then who?

Magical: Lionel Messi has also scored four goals in Brazil as Argentina prepare to face Switzerland in the last 16

Not Wayne Rooney. The No 10 can be a curse, too. One goal in three World Cups. A tap-in at that. Back home already. To be conferred with the No 10 is an honour but you accept it at your peril. Deliver or stand condemned forever.

So, who else?

The more dedicated students of the game will be aware of him, but James Rodriguez will be a stranger to the majority. Yet Senor Rodriguez has already scored three goals at Brazil 2014, the same as Benzema and just one behind Neymar and Lionel Messi.

At just 22. For Colombia.

The team who arrived here as nobody’s favourites, outside Bogota and the old drugs capitals such as Medellin, are suddenly in the last 16. And now hardly anybody is betting against them beating Uruguay.

We tend to associate Colombian football with Bobby Moore being falsely accused of pilfering a bracelet there en route to the World Cup finals of Mexico 1970. Or defender Andres Escobar being killed after Colombia exited the competition in 1994.

Now we have a much better reason to pay attention. Namely James David Rodriguez Rubio.

New hero: Colombia's James Rodriguez
has starred with goals and assists

Leader of the dance: Colombia have won three out of three games and face a Uruguay without Luis Suarez

So far at this World Cup he has scored one and made two against Greece, headed one and made one against the Ivory Coast and scored one and made two against Japan despite resting on the bench until the second half.

This young man slipped into Porto under the radar from club football in his native country and Argentina. He arrived in Portugal clutching a host of youth football honours, team and individual, but virtually unknown in Europe.

Porto won their league title in each of the three years he was with them. He became the youngest player to be awarded Portugal’s Golden Ball.

Someone was paying attention. Someone who is no stranger to football and the world beyond football.

Sir Alex Ferguson has not formally confirmed that United offered Porto €30 million last year to take Rodriguez to Manchester United. What he does say on the record is brief and revealing: ‘This lad is a game-changer.’

And not just because he scores a few goals — 61 in 223 senior appearances, eight of them in his first 25 matches for Colombia.

The real beauty of Rodriguez is his creativity, his orchestrating of the play with such elegance that there seem to be times when even the most hostile of opponents cannot help but stand back and admire.

He's electric: Rodriguez nods Colombia ahead against Ivory Coast

A star is born: Rodriguez has justified the hype with some wonderful displays for Colombia

When he was emerging from the cocoon of boyhood they could not work out whether he was a winger, a midfield player or a forward. What we are coming to realise at this tournament is that he is something which is simpler but more profound. A footballer.

An inspiration: Carlos Valderrama took Colombia to the last 16 in Italia 90

Is he left-footed or right-footed? Take your choice. Is he a goal-maker or a goal-taker? You pay your money and you take your choice.

In the case of AS Monaco you pay €45m while United are dithering.

You make him the most expensive footballer ever to come out of Colombia, one of the most expensive in the world. You pay the money even though you know he trains to be lithe and elusive rather than modern and muscle-powered.

Rodriguez  prefers to play the beautiful rather than bruising game.

Perhaps that is why he is blossoming in Brazil.

Although he is clean-cut, his hero is Carlos Valderrama, the bohemian virtuoso with the hedge-like blond afro hair who inspired Colombia to over-perform in World Cups past.

‘I actually met Mr Valderrama once,’ he says with touching respect. ‘I always admired him a lot. He was not only a great player but a great person and very intelligent. He gave a lot of happiness to our country.’

When it is mentioned that he might be talking about himself in the very near future, he says: ‘I only hope I can do the same.’

If so, it will be in similar, fantasy style. Like Valderrama, young Rodriguez seems to float through even the most frenzied matches as if on a cloud of dreams.

Warning signs: Rodriguez had this goal disallowed fo Porto against Manchester city in the Europa League

Big-money move: Rodriguez moved to Monaco from Porto for ¿45m

In the tradition of most great players, he finds time and space amidst the maelstrom. And as  Ferguson observed, he uses it to prise open the most robust defences with the most delicately penetrating passes.

At times he is an illusionist, making the ball reappear in the most unexpected places. If United’s bid failed it may have more to do with the style of football he prefers than the money.

Life's a beach: Radamel Falcao relaxes in Miami while his team-mates forge a path into the knockout stages

There is talk of him moving again soon, to an even more major league than the French.But when that possibility is raised he says, with both charm and candour: ‘The Premier League is very physical. In Spain, for  example, it is more about the  technique and guile which can give a player like me more touches of the ball. That is what I love about playing this game.’

That is why fellow Colombians love him. When their initial hope for a successful World Cup, the  at-times brilliant Radamel Falcao, was deprived by injury of the  biggest moment of his career, depression descended.

Then along came James, to drive them south to Brazil in their scores of thousands, following their new Pied Piper. He says: ‘Having the World Cup in Brazil, where so many of our fans can travel, is enormous for us.’

Valderrama was nicknamed El Pibe, The Kid. Now they call Rodriguez El Nuevo Pibe, The New Kid.While Brazil and Argentina await the ascensions of Neymar and Messi, could it be that Colombia have found their Pele, their  Maradona, their new Valderrama?

Rodriguez will be 23 the day before the World Cup final at the mighty Maracana on July 13. Might he still be here to celebrate?

If he is, if he leaves here as the number one No 10. His throne in the pantheon awaits.
