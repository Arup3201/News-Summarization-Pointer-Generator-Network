DIY
 YouTuber Emily Hartridge is back, and this time she's been extolling 
the virtues of sex, explaining exactly why she believes women love 
getting frisky in the bedroom.

From
 the personal health benefits of cuddling up to the impact it has on your 
relationship, sex is fabulous in more ways than one, the young west Londoner explains in her latest 10 Reasons Why... video.

It improves bladder control, it keeps you in shape, it helps you keep your man quiet for a few days afterwards, 'and it enables you to imagine having sex with someone you actually want to be having sex with,' she says.

Helped by one of her three sisters, Jessica, Emily explores the subject of why women enjoy a bit of hanky-panky, starting with the fact that it strengthens a woman's pelvic floor muscles to improve bladder control and moving swiftly onto how it keeps you fit by burning five calories per minute.

'So if you had sex for an hour you'd burn 300 calories!' she shrieks, heading back inside wearing clean jogging gear, thinking her time would be better spent in bed.

As well as allowing you to show off your new bikini wax without terrifying strangers in the street, Emily explains, sex also 'pumps
 more oxygen into your body which increases the flow of blood and 
nutrients into the skin, which in Layman's terms means sex gives women a healthy glow.'

Studies
 also show that having sex just once or twice per week can boost your immune 
system, so any women getting a cold should instead find themselves a partner.

Believing that women are, after all, the 'gatekeepers to sex' within a relationship, Emily also says that if you 'have sex with a guy once and you can shut him up for a few days'.

And her final tip? 'Having sex enables women to imagine having sex with someone they actually want to be having sex with.'

Pucker up, ladies. It's good for you.
