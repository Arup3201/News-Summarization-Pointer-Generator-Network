Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United would be unable to stop David de Gea from joining Real Madrid if the La Liga giants were to make a move for the Spanish goalkeeper.

De Gea has been stringently linked with a move to the La Liga giants and talk a possible move to the Santiago Bernabeu heightened following Victor Valdes' move to Manchester United.

And Carragher insists United would be powerless if Real Madrid were to come calling.

Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United will struggle to keep hold of David de Gea 

Real Madrid target De Gea has been in fine form for Manchester United so far this season

Cristiano Ronaldo and Xabi Alonso left the Premier League when Real Madrid came calling 

Speaking on Sky Sports' Super Sunday show, Carragher said: 'When Real Madrid come in - no matter who you are - they can still take them.

'They done it with Cristiano Ronaldo here [at Old Trafford]. Unfortunately as he's Spanish it may be that dream move for him one day. It was the same with Xabi Alonso at Liverpool.

'The worry for Louis van Gaal may be how close is De Gea to signing a new contract. That maybe in the back of his mind.'

The former Liverpool defender also stated he does not believe Valdes will be happy playing second fiddle next season, if De Gea was to remain at Old Trafford.

Carragher does not believe a keeper of Victor Valdes' calibre will be happy on the substitutes' bench 

Carragher added: 'The start of next season Victor Valdes - due to his reputation and what he's won playing at Barcelona - will want some game time.

'He may get that as we expect Manchester United to be in the Champions League. So he will have more games to play but I don't see him ever overtaking De Gea.

'They have problems defensively but they don't concede that many goals because of him. Their defensive record is quite good.

'The manager has come in and every manager will want a good back up goalkeeper. He's maybe looked at Anders Lindegaard and thought he's not the answer.

'He knows Valdes from Barcelona and maybe they have a good relationship. I think the thing for Valdes between now and the end of the season will be about his fitness. He's had a long-term injury. He needs to get back, sharp and proper coaching at a big club, which he is used to.'

Anders Lindegaard could be allowed to return to Scandinavia following Valdes' arrival at Old Trafford
