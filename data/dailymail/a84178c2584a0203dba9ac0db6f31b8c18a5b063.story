She will be the oldest Bond girl in 007 history and at 50, Monica Bellucci insists there's nothing girly about her new role. 

The Italian sex bomb told the Giles Hattersley at the Sunday Times Style magazine that she wants to be known as a Bond lady when the latest film, Spectre, is released later this year. 

'I'm not a girl, I'm a woman. I'm a mature woman,' Bellucci told director Sam Mendes when she met him to discuss the movie, which is currently filming in London and Rome. 

She added: 'I am a Bond lady.'

At 50 years old, Monica Bellucci will be the oldest Bond girl in 007 history, but says she has no desire to look younger

Four years older than Daniel Craig, Bellucci is the only Bond girl to be older than her co-star since Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg in the 1960s.

The former Dolce & Gabbana model, whose film accolades include The Matrix Reloaded and who was last seen presenting at the Baftas two weeks ago, was born in 1964 - the year Goldfinger was released. 

She has shunned plastic surgery and is a poster girl for growing old gracefully, telling the magazine: 'We have to start to respect women getting older. 

'The real you comes out, and you can see it in the face. I don't want to be younger.'

Since hitting 40, life has certainly been busy for the actress.

Monica had her first child the same year and her second child at 45 with French actor Vincent Cassel, from whom she divorced in 2013 after an 18 year relationship. 

She says having children has given her the ability to 'forget herself' and said: 'You wake up, go to the bathroom to clean your baby and see yourself in the mirror only by coincidence.'
