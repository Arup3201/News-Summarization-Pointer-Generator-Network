The number of deaths linked to the use of so-called legal highs in England have increased eightfold in three years, new figures show.

In 2009 12 people died after taking the drugs, compared to to 97 in 2012.

Think-tank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), which revealed the statistics, has called on the Government to grant police more powers to close shops selling the dangerous drugs. 

Figures show deaths associated with legal highs have increased eightfold, rising from 12 in 2009 to 97 in 2012

The group say the UK has the highest rate of legal highs use among young people in Europe, and said police and courts should be given new powers to close the 'head shops' which sell many of the substances.

The CSJ is asking the Government to implement legislation similar to laws introduced in Ireland in 2010, which saw the number of head shops in the country fall from more than 100 to less than 10.

The number of people receiving treatment for using legal highs has more than tripled, soaring from 738 in 2009 to 2,339 last year

The organisation also revealed that the number of people in treatment in England for taking legal highs has jumped by 216 per cent over the last five years, rising from 738 in 2009/10 to 2,339 last year

CSJ director Christian Guy said: 'This is yet another wake-up call to the dangers of so-called 'legal highs'.

'Legal highs are destroying lives - it is time to get tough on those making a living out of selling them.

'The UK is already the addicted man of Europe with some of the worst rates of heroin, crack and alcohol abuse - tackling legal highs needs to be a priority.'

In the past five years the number of people in treatment for use of mephedrone, which was banned in 2010, rose by 95 per cent. 

For GBL and GHB use, which was banned in 2009, figures rose by 75 per cent.

The number of people in treatment for the use of ketamine, which became illegal in 2006, has increased by 40 per cent.
