At noon on Wednesday, Keith Kirk, a homeless man, took an expensive bicycle from outside a One Stop Food Mart in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Yet the bike’s owner, Calvin McDougal of Lauderhill, was watching his property closely. While waiting in line, he noticed it was no longer where he left it. So he left the store to apprehend the thief.

According to police reports, McDougal pursued and tackled Kirk. This led to a fight which left Kirk with two black eyes, one which is swollen shut, and several cuts, one requiring stitches.

It is unclear if McDougal was injured in the altercation, but Kirk was taken to a local hospital. There he admitted trying to steal the bike and charged with one count of grand larceny.

The badly-beaten Kirk appeared in first appearance court in Thursday. As reported by the Sun Sentinel, Broward County Judge John 'Jay' Hurley told him: ‘I believe there was a little bit more than just a tackle. Now, sir, you allegedly steal someone's bike and it looks like there was some street justice carried out.’

Judge Hurley charged Kirk with grand theft and the disfigured man was released on his own recognizance.

Florida law states that if there is reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed, a citizen's arrest can be made and the suspect detained until police arrive.

Yet a citizen’s arrest is subject to the same laws as any police arrest. What might be deemed as excessive force, for example, cannot be used.

The authorities have made their decision on whether excessive force was carried out in this case.

Detective DeAnna Garcia told the Sun Sentinel that  'Mr McDougal was a victim making a citizen's arrest and was not arrested.'
