Singer Adele’s boyfriend is battling Pepsi in a bid to stop the drinks giant ‘hijacking’ his ethical water business.

Simon Konecki, a former City trader, and Adele have a ten-month-old son Angelo.

Mr Konecki is taking legal action to stop the US firm trademarking its drink, SoBe Lifewater, in Britain, because he claims it sounds too similar to his bottled water, Life.

Life’s profits are donated to his charity Drop4Drop, which funds clean drinking water in developing countries.

Mr Konecki, 38, said he is ‘frustrated’ and is preparing to fight the case in court tomorrow.

‘The name Lifewater is almost identical to Life water, and we’d be incredibly disappointed for anyone to confuse our ethical, charitable and carbon neutral water with one that doesn’t share those values,’ he said.

PepsiCo confirmed it is seeking to register 
Lifewater as a global trademark, but said Pepsi has 'no current plans' 
to use Lifewater as a trademark in Britain

PepsiCo confirmed it is seeking to register Lifewater as a global trademark, but said Pepsi has ‘no current plans’ to use Lifewater as a trademark in Britain.

‘We are aware of the ‘Life’ trademark in the UK and believe confusion in the market is unlikely given the different nature of the products.’
