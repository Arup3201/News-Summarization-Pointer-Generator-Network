Fears that Germany’s grip on the eurozone is tightening increased last night after it emerged that details of Ireland’s budget plans were leaked to German politicians.

A document circulated in the German Bundestag revealed Dublin’s proposals to save the debt-ridden country £3.25billion.

The details were for next year’s budget, which have not yet been approved by the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny.

Control: German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Fears that the country's grip on the eurozone is tightening have increased

Discussions: Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny with Angela Merkel and David Cameron at an EU summit last month. Mr Kenny also met the German Chancellor in Berlin earlier this week

He was forced into an embarrassing denial that his plans were being inspected in Berlin.

Any suggestion that Ireland is running its austerity cuts past Europe’s economic powerhouse for approval will fuel concern that Germany is using its wealth as a lever to amass power over the 17-nation single currency bloc.

Mr Kenny met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin earlier this week.

Asked how such sensitive information ended up in the hands of a foreign power – just a day after their meeting – Mr Kenny said he had ‘no idea’.

He said his government had made no decision on the content of the budget, due to be presented on December 6.

Measures that Ireland will take as a 
condition of its bailout from the European Union and International 
Monetary Fund have already been made public.

They include a property levy aimed at collecting £137million, while £92million is to be raised from a new carbon tax.

The government will also raise £573million by hiking VAT from 21 per cent to 23 per cent.

Ireland’s Department of Finance said it had no explanation for why the document – which was not signed by finance minister Michael Noonan – had ended up in German hands.

Ireland was forced to accept a £73billion bailout package last year from the EU and IMF after the economy once dubbed the ‘Celtic Tiger’ rapidly turned into one of Europe’s basket cases.

Concerns: Earlier this week, Berlin declared that Europe is 'speaking German and Britain must be less selfish' towards the EU

The rescue deal saw Prime Minister David Cameron commit to helping Britain’s ‘neighbour and friend’, because the two economies are so closely linked.

Britain’s contribution to the Irish bailout via the EU saw taxpayers fork out some £7billion to prop up the Irish economy, as its banking system teetered on the brink of collapse.

Dublin is aiming to slash around £10billion from spending plans over the next four years in an austerity drive aimed at forging a lasting economic recovery.

Earlier this week, Berlin declared that Europe is ‘speaking German and Britain must be less selfish’ towards the EU.

The UK has a duty to help the eurozone despite being outside the single currency, according to one of Mrs Merkel’s closest allies.

Even more provocatively, Volker Kauder, leader of Germany’s CDU parliamentary party, warned Britain could not block a financial tax that would cost the City billions.
