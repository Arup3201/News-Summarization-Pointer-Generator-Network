A British Airways flight was forced to veer off course to avoid a Spanish military aircraft as it prepared to land at Gibraltar’s airport last week, authorities have confirmed.

Gibraltar’s government said the Lockheed P-3 Orion anti-submarine and maritime surveillance aircraft was flying ahead of the BA plane through the Straits when it ‘suddenly reversed its direction and took another course’ on Friday afternoon.

The incident sparked safety and political concerns as air traffic controllers issued an emergency order for the BA flight, which was 10 to 15 miles from landing, to immediately change direction to maintain a safe distance.

A statement from the government said the Spanish Air Force plane’s manoeuvre ‘would have infringed safety parameters had the BA flight not moved under instructions from Gibraltar ATC.’

The incident occurred while the BA Airbus A320 was flying from London Heathrow Airport to the tiny contested British outpost on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula. 

In a statement, British Airways said: 'Our flight crew followed air traffic control instructions, as they normally would, and the flight landed without incident.'

Gibraltar’s government said it understands that the Spanish aircraft contacted local air traffic controllers and clarified its intentions after which the BA flight was given clearance to land, the Gibraltar Chronicle reported.

Gibraltar’s government is investigating whether the military aircraft entered the airspace over the British Gibraltar Territorial Waters disputed by Spain.

An FCO spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: ‘We are aware of the incident on 31st October involving a British Airways commercial flight bound for Gibraltar.

‘The aircraft was asked to divert from its original routing because of the activity of a Spanish military aircraft in the area.

‘Air traffic control were in contact with both aircraft and the British Airways plane diverted in accordance with standard ATC procedures. There was at no time any risk to safety.’ 

The FCO said it was not an unlawful incursion into ‘British Gibraltar airspace’ as the Spanish aircraft remained in Spanish airspace at all times. 

The incident follows a series of diplomatic rows between the UK and Spain over the British Overseas Territory.

In October Britain’s Foreign & Commonwealth Office accused a Spanish state research vessel of carrying out ‘irresponsible’ and ‘dangerous manoeuvring in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters, potentially risking the lives of Royal Navy personnel.

Europe minister David Lidington called Spain's secretary of state for foreign affairs Gonzalo de Benito to express 'grave concerns' about October's incident.

That incident followed news that Spanish fighter jets flew 'across the bow' of a Monarch Airlines plane as it landed on Gibraltar.

Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty.

Gibraltar has accused Spain of harassment and bullying, and the FCO says it has seen a surge in the number of incursions into territorial waters.

Last year alone Spanish state vessels made 496 illegal incursions in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters.
