A mother has been fined £500 after her son spent just three days in school out of a possible 118, it was revealed today.

Nicola Duke was one of three parents prosecuted last week for failing to ensure their child attends Furness Academy in Barrow, Cumbria, and she was fined £500 plus £120 of other costs.

But figures obtained since the conviction showed her son spent just three days in school between January and July 2013.

The figures also revealed how a fellow pupil had a 26 per cent attendance record - spending 30 days at school out of 118. That pupil's father, Christian Ryan, 37, was fined £1,170 including costs.

And Karen Bromley pleaded guilty to failing to make her son attend Furness Academy and was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge.

The figures show her son had an attendance record of 22 per cent - meaning he was at school for 26 days out of a possible 118.

Last month, Furness Academy revealed that Des Herlihy, who was appointed interim headteacher in June 2013, will remain as executive principal until July 2015.

Responding to the prosecutions, Mr Herlihy said: ‘We do not comment on individual cases.

Parents of children aged five to 16 are legally responsible for ensuring they attend school regularly - unless they are home educated.

Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents penalty notices of up to £100 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid, a prosecution will follow - and this can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a three-month jail term or a community sentence.

Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime.

Good attendance at school is essential to ensure progress and enable children to reach their full potential.

‘At Furness Academy we are committed to good standards of attendance and we will use the legal processes open to us to achieve this.’

A spokesman for Cumbria County Council added: ‘Schools and the local authority work closely with families when there are attendance issues and we do all we can to improve attendance and stress the negative impact truancy can have on a child’s education.

‘While we always look to resolve attendance issues through having discussions and offering support, these three cases send out a message that we will prosecute as a last resort when other methods for improving attendance fail.’
