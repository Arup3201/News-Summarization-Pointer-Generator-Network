The work began the moment Superstorm Sandy's floodwaters ebbed back into the sea.

Over the past year, people from Cape May, N.J., to Montauk, N.Y., have been mucking out their flooded homes, trucking away tons of debris and putting their lives back together, one piece of drywall at a time.

There has been plenty to do. When the Atlantic heaved forward, it 
swallowed thousands of vehicles and fried the power systems that make 
the Manhattan skyline dazzle after dark.

Then: The work began the moment Superstorm Sandy's floodwaters ebbed back into the sea. A flag waving in front of the burned remains of more than 60 small bungalows which were destroyed at Camp Osborn in Brick, N.J., during Superstorm Sandy

Now: Jose Figueiredo holds a stick while crossing Route 35 in Ortley Beach, N.J. A year ago, the road was covered in beach sand and debris

Hundreds of buildings burned in wind-whipped fires.One year into the recovery, some of the locations hit hardest by the storm have been revisited.

The progress in some communities has been remarkable. In others, it has been painfully slow.

Boardwalks and amusement parks on Long Island and the Jersey Shore have been rebuilt.

Yet, countless buildings sit vacant and moldering, while others have been reduced to empty 
lots or piles of sand.

Then: Debris left by Superstorm Sandy  where the boardwalk had been in front of Lucky Leo's arcade in Seaside Heights, N.J.

Now: People walking along the rebuilt boardwalk in Seaside Heights, N.J., where a year ago Superstorm Sandy left the resort area in ruins

Some homeowners are still staring at the same 
stripped studs and piles of lumber that have been in their living rooms 
since last November.

One thing is clear: There has been no retreat yet from the shore.

Houses are slowly rising again all along the coast, albeit sometimes on strange platforms above the high water mark.

Thousands of people still trying to fix their soaked and surf-battered 
homes are being stymied by bureaucracy, insurance disputes and 
uncertainty over whether they can even afford to rebuild.

Billions of dollars in federal aid 
appropriated months ago by Congress have yet to reach homeowners who 
need that money to move on. Many have found flood insurance checks 
weren't nearly enough to cover the damage.

And
 worse, new federal rules mean many in high-risk flood zones may have to
 either jack their houses up on stilts or pilings - an expensive, 
sometimes impossible task - or face new insurance rates that hit $10,000
 or more per year.

'It's
 just been such a terrible burden,' says Gina Maxwell, whose home in 
Little Egg Harbor, N.J., is still a wreck after filling with 4 feet of 
water. Contractors say it will cost $270,000 to rebuild - about double 
what the insurance paid out. The family doesn't have the money.

'My son is 11. He has a little piggy bank in his room. He said, "Take it, mom."
