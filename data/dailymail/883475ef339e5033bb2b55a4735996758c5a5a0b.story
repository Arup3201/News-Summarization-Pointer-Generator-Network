Much of the talk surrounding Liverpool this summer has been focused on who will replace Luis Suarez.

What Brendan Rodgers quickly realised is that there was probably no one that could. And therefore against Southampton at Anfield he had to adapt - changing last season's hugely successful system to make up for the loss of his £75million striker.

Daniel Sturridge, cut loose from his familiar partner, worked as a lone striker. Raheem Sterling went wide on the left while Philippe Coutinho took his place on the right with a license to move inside. Rickie Lambert had to settle for a spot on the bench.

It was a familiar sight at Anfield last season - an incisive through ball cutting through the opposition defence and finding a forward to confidently finish off the move with aplomb.

Only this time round, that forward wasn't Luis Suarez.

Raheem Sterling moved inside from his left wing position and latched on to Jordan Henderson's excellent ball from inside his own half to tuck the ball beyond Fraser Forster - putting Liverpool ahead after 23 minutes.

But while last season Liverpool were free-flowing and constantly dangerous - against the Saints there were teething problems, although they did eventually start the post-Suarez era with a win.

And it had all started so well - Rodgers' tactical switch paid dividends midway through the first half when  Sterling scored the opener.

The pacey 19-year-old was hanging around on the left while Manquillo and Jordan Henderson fought for the ball in midfield. With Sturridge and Coutinho otherwise occupied, Henderson looked up to see Sterling as the best option.

The additional width provided by his new role put Sterling in the perfect positon to sprint away from Nathaniel Clyne and giving him the chance to finish coolly past Fraser Forster.

It was the sort of move so frequently seen last season when Suarez was cutting defences into ribbons - and would have had Liverpool fans believing that there is life after Suarez.

But unfortunately that moment was out of the ordinary rather than the norm. While there were concerns about nullifying Sterling's threat out wide for England this summer - Liverpool ended up having exactly the same problem with Coutinho.

Tactical issue: Coutinho found it difficult to create from out wide and his inroads into midfield weren't great

The Brazilian playmaker has been in great form for the Reds in pre season but he simply couldn't get ahold of the game - finding it difficult to create from the wide role and finding himself a little lost when he tried to make inroads into the centre of the park.

That left Sturridge starved of service with Sterling - who was excellent in the first half - only providing fleeting glimpses of his talent in the second half as Southampton grew into the game.

Steven Gerrard for once looked a little lost, leaving Henderson as the prime creator - a role that he performed admirably but that proved too much to shoulder alone.

Rodgers rung the changes, with Joe Allen coming in for Lucas and Lambert making his debut in place of Coutinho. Allen made things a bit more direct and his impact helped create the winner.

Sturridge slipped in the winner after the ball had bounced around the Southampton area with four Liverpool players in the box as they mixed it up.

It was relief rather than justification for Rodgers' tactical switch but for now it doesn't matter. Liverpool are off and running with three points - but the conundrum of how to replace Suarez continues and they will need to do more against Manchester City in their second Premier League game.
