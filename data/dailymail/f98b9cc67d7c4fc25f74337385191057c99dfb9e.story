Representatives from Barcelona are in London in the hope of thrashing out a deal for Thomas Vermaelen as they face a straight with Manchester United to sign the defender.

The 28-year-old has been the subject of bids from both the Catalans and United this summer, with Arsene Wenger confirming that the latter have lodged a formal bid.

Barcelona have sent director Raul Senlleh to London for talks in the hope of signing the player and Arsenal are receptive to selling to Spain.

On his way? Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen could be moving to Barcelona

As with the transfer of Robin van Persie in 2012, they do not wish to strengthen their rivals in spite of Vermaelen's indifferent form in recent seasons. 

United are mindful of the real figures Barcelona present as opposed to some that are being leaked; they will pay a reasonable value but believe the player will, like Van Persie, ask to join them ahead of Luis Enrique's Barca.

Vermaelen's days at the Emirates Stadium are numbered after he played just 14 times in the Premier League for Wenger's side last season.

He isn't training with the Gunners at the moment because of a niggling hamstring injury and it remains unclear as to where he'll be playing his football this year. 

In to the final year of his contract, Vermaelen is almost certain to leave the club. Barcelona have lodged a bid of around £10million.

Wenger said: 'Manchester United are part of the group (of bidders). 

'Vermaelen could leave us because he needs to play now. We're in a position where it's difficult to stand in his way.

'We would prefer to sell him aboard. That is an option. We have offers from abroad as well. We have bids. You will know very soon.'

One player who could replace Vermaelen is Calum Chambers, who Arsenal signed for £16million from Southampton.

The 19-year-old played at right-back last season in his debut campaign in the Premier League but Wenger believes the youngster is ready to make an impact at the heart of his defence.

'Can he play every week? Maybe not, he is 19 years old but he can play a major role,' Wenger said.

'He has the qualities to impose his quality in this part of the team (central defence) and I believe he can play in defensive midfield as well.

'I believe he is good value for money. He is 19 and a promising talent 

Decisions: Vermaelen moved to Arsenal from Dutch side Ajax in 2009 and was once a crucial cog 

'As a manager you believe in the players when you buy them - we spent a lot of money on him but overall, in the long-term, it is money well spent.

'When the players play at the top for a long period you can never say it's expensive. It is expensive now but I don't regret it.'

Meanwhile, Arsenal remain keen on Manchester City's Matija Nastasic and a £15m bid will get the player.

United have not made an offer for Juan Cuadrado of Fiorentina and are not talking to Borussia Dortmund over Mats Hummels. No offer has been made for Marco Reus either.
