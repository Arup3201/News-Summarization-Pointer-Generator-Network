Vets have performed what could be one of the world’s smallest amputations - on a field mouse run over by a wheelie bin.

The rodent - called Mickey - was left with serious injuries when Debra Tuck, 51, put out her rubbish at her home in Seaham, County Durham.

She scooped up the mouse and took it to Westway Veterinary Group in nearby Houghton-le-Spring - and despite a slim chance he would survive, they carried out surgery to remove his crushed leg.

Now, Mrs Tuck has decided to keep Mickey as a pet - despite admitting she is 'petrified' of mice.

Playful: Despite the chance Mickey would not survive, vets carried out surgery to remove his crushed leg

Westway director and senior vet Jason Atherton authorised a delicate - but ultimately successful - operation that saw vet Catriona Redman remove Mickey’s front limb. 

Vets have since been astounded by the recovery of Mickey, who has been adopted by Mrs Tuck and her husband Gary, 56, who now live with the animal at their £135,000 semi-detached house.

Mr Atherton told MailOnline that the operation cost the vet's about £200 to perform, but if someone had brought the mouse in for treatment as a pet they would have been charged about £150.

Administration worker Mrs Tuck said: ‘My husband and I love wildlife and we wouldn’t hurt a fly so we couldn’t have left a tiny injured mouse to die outside in the freezing cold.

‘Even though I’m petrified of mice, I was mortified when I saw that I’d hurt him and there was blood coming from his leg. Jason thought he might not come through the operation.

‘But then I got a call saying he had pulled through and I was so relieved. He has thrived ever since and is so full of character, with the brightest eyes and the loveliest coat.’

Mickey’s treatment was paid for by Westway’s £3,000-a-year fund for treating stray animals and is made up of donations - including from marathon runs by Mr Atherton and his wife Jill.

Mr Atherton said: ‘His chances of survival were slim, so we had to think carefully before authorising major surgery on such a small animal. That decision has certainly proved right as mouse and owner so happy.

‘When he came in I said I would fix him if it was possible to do so. He wouldn’t have been able to be released back into the wild but I agreed to amputate if Debra was prepared to keep him as a pet. Removing the leg is relatively easy, it’s just a bit fiddly, and because Mickey was so young, he has adapted to life as a pet.’
