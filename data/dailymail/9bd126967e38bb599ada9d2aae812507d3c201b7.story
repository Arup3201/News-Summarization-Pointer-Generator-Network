A man who spends his time hunting with a bow and arrow, trapping small animals and fishing for food lives like a modern day Fred Flintstone.

Wearing a reindeer hide coat and furs, Stone Age expert Will Lord forages for nuts and berries, lights fires for warmth and builds primitive shelters from branches.

But this is Suffolk, not Bedrock.

Now Mr Lord, 42, runs 'prehistoric' weekends in East Anglia, charging Â£185 for people to learn how to fashion spears, make stone tools and implements, butcher the animals and birds they catch and cook the meat in earth ovens.

He teaches people to survive as if they lived in the Mesolithic era 6,000 to 12,000 years ago.

Mr Lord, who lives near Bury St Edmunds with his wife Sarah and three-year-old son Xander, said: 'It is possible to see through the eyes of our ancestors and explore how they felt.

'We soon learn how clumsy we have become but then with a little coaching people can become capable and empowered.

'Having dedicated more than thirty years to the subject I can say that we would all suffer misery if suddenly faced with the habitat and lifestyle of our ancestors.

'Our modern mind-sets are no longer in tune with the environment, food chain and everyday struggle for survival.

Mr Lord's skills are straight out of the Mesolithic era, between 6,000 and 12,000 years ago

'Skills that were carefully honed over thousands of years have been lost in just a few generations.

'But with a little determination we can all rediscover some of the benefits of their ancient ways such as a more harmonious existence.

Mr Lord has previously advised documentary makers on Ancient Britain and the Neanderthals and hopes to have his own television series one day, where he teaches people how to live, Stone Age-style.
