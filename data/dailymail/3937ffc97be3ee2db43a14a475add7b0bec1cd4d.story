The daughter of former Doctor Who star Colin Baker had a lucky escape when her car span off the road and smashed into a tree after hitting a pothole.

Lally Baker, 22, said she 'thought she was going to die' when her car hit the tree on a busy road in Buckinghamshire on Wednesday night.

Miss Baker, whose father played the 6th incarnation of Doctor Who between 1984 and 1986, was travelling home along a 50mph stretch of the Amersham Road towards High Wycombe when the crash happened.

Although her blue Nissan Micra was a write off following the smash, Miss Baker was fortunate enough to walk away with just a bruised nose.

She said: 'It was very scary. The first thing I thought was I was going to die.

'There was blood on my face and I didn't know where that was coming from.

'The pothole came out of nowhere. I think the wheel got stuck in it and just spun me around.

'I just spiralled off the road and that's where I met a tree.

'I'm okay but I've got a very blue nose. Thankfully the airbag and seatbelt did their job.'

Her relieved father Colin, who recently went into the jungle as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, added: 'She walked away but if you look at the car you wouldn't think that was possible.'

Miss Baker, who lives in the village of Cadmore End and works for a charity in London, said a small section of the road was coned off with a sign saying 'Slow - Failed Road Surface', and she drove round this at about 40mph.

It was then that she hit the pothole.

After helping recover the crashed car yesterday morning she said the coned area had now been widened to cover the hole.

She said: 'It's a lot bigger than I thought it was. It's about one-and-a-half or two inches deep, but it's just very wide and covers a long length of road.

'Perhaps the council could have done more and put the cones around a wider area to be 100 per cent sure.'

A spokesman for Buckinghamshire County Council, said: 'We are very sorry that someone has had an accident.

'We had this road defect called through on Friday afternoon as a two hour call out and our Amersham depot gang went out to make it safe. The area has been coned off as a result of the request.'

She added that repairs on the road will be carried out later this month.
