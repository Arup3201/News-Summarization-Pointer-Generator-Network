Wine should be watered down to preserve the health of middle-class drinkers, ministers have suggested.

They argue that the minimum strength of ‘still wine’ should be reduced by law from 8.5 per cent alcohol-by-volume to 4.5 per cent – about a third as strong as today’s typical table wines.

Earl Howe, the health minister, said the market for low- or reduced- alcohol wines has been ‘increasing rapidly’ in recent years.

NHS figures show that professionals are almost twice as likely to drink heavily than those on lower income

He claimed that allowing producers to make weaker wine would be in the ‘long-term interest’ of the public, amid concern over rises in liver disease and cancers linked to alcohol consumption.

They also warn that small, regular 
amounts of wine – viewed by many middle-class drinkers as a reward after
a hard day of work or looking after children – can cause long-term 
problems, including liver damage and even cancer.

Lord Howe told the Daily Telegraph: 
‘The Government has consistently made the case for a change to the EU 
wine rules to permit reduced and de-alcoholised products to be called 
wines.’

However, 
critics say the suggestion will anger many wine-drinkers, who have faced
above-inflation tax rises on their tipple of choice over the past five 
years.

Wine producers in 
the European Union have already mounted opposition to a new definition 
of wines, which could include alcohol-free drinks.

As a result, the latest round of negotiations over the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy failed to reach an agreement.

Nevertheless, Lord Howe promised to ‘continue to work hard to bring this topic back on to the EU wine policy agenda as soon as possible’.

The market for weaker wine has indeed grown in recent years.

Almost seven million bottles with an alcohol content of less than 8.5 per cent were sold in Britain in 2011 – two million more than the year before.

Should wine be watered down to 'protect the middle class'?

Furthermore, alcohol consumption has, on average, been falling since 2004. But despite this trend, a study published last year showed that just 29 per cent of us actually pay attention to how much alcohol drinks contain.

A government spokesman said yesterday: ‘We want to encourage alcohol manufacturers to make lower-alcohol alternatives; these [current] rules do not help our cause.

‘We will continue our efforts to change EU wine rules, to allow all wine producers to make and market lower-alcohol products.

‘This will help to help promote healthier choices and tackle the serious harm alcohol causes’.
