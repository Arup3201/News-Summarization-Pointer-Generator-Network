An overweight mother plagued by shyness dramatically transformed her body - and conquered her nerves - to enter a beauty contest.

Lucy Doyle, 31, ditched the junk food and dropped a staggering five stone before taking to the stage in front of hundreds of spectators wearing just a bikini for the Miss Galaxy Universe competition, held in Crawley, West Sussex.

Lucy, who has two daughters Niamh, eight, and Ruby, seven, with husband Dominic, 40, said: 'I used to dread the school run because I didn't have the confidence to chat to the other mums in the playground. I'd just drop the kids and wouldn't hang around.

New woman: Lucy has dropped from 13 stone to a slimline eight but has grown in confidence

Big boost: Lucy was too shy to talk to other parents outside the school gates, but now she's happy to chat

'I didn't have many friends because I was too shy to say hello and couldn't join in conversations because I didn't think I had anything worth saying.

'I comfort ate chocolate croissants and homemade scones and I was even making late-night trips to the shop so I could make triple-chocolate sundaes.

'At the time I thought I was doing it to reward myself for being a good mum - but I didn't feel like one.

'I was so overweight that I began to struggle physically. I just didn't have the energy and the get-up-and-go that other parents had with their kids.

'If I ran around after the girls I'd get tired very quickly and avoided doing it. Getting into their playhouse for a pretend tea party also took its toll because I struggled to get down on my hands and knees.

'I felt I was really letting my children and myself down and that was my turning point. I realised I had to change.

'Now my transformation has not only 
meant that I can run around with the children again but it's also given 
me the confidence to approach other mums in the playground.

'It's actually become a conversation starter and has helped me to build more friendships.'

By the time she'd slimmed down to a size eight, Lucy, a support worker and 
nutritionist, felt emotionally transformed too. She was finally able to conquer her chronic shyness and felt confident enough to take part in Miss 
Galaxy Universe in May, entering herself into the Yummy Mummy and Bikini
Diva category.

Contestants in the beauty and fitness competition take part in gruelling fitness tests and show off their toned physiques in bikinis.

Lucy said: 'I'd never have even considered it before I lost the weight but that was the old me - the new me was proud of her body. I wanted to show off all the hard work I'd done.

'And when I did make the step out in front of all those people I was filled with a sudden feeling of elation. I'd finally done it.

'I still remember looking out in the audience and seeing my kids and Dominic cheering me on. They were so proud of me.

'I wasn't even bothered about winning anything because, for me, I had won already by stepping out on that stage in front of all those people in a bikini.

'So when they announced that I'd come third in the Yummy Mummy category I was stunned.'

Feeling good: Lucy was proud to show her new body off in the beauty contest, where she took third place in the Yummy Mummy category

Strong: Lucy pushes herself hard with high-intensity sprints and by flipping tractor tyres in her spare time

Lucy, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, has suffered from intense shyness since childhood. As she got older, she began to comfort eat to deal with difficult social situations and quickly piled on the pounds.

At her heaviest, she was 13 stone and wore a size 16.

She said: 'As I got bigger, my self confidence almost completely disappeared.

'I began to suffer from depression and chronic fatigue. At my lowest points, I felt like I barely existed.'

Lucy kick-started her transformation in 2011 by replacing junk food with a balanced diet of fruit, vegetables and meat and even started making her own low-fat Jaffa cakes as a treat.

She also hit the gym three times a week, increasing to five times in the 16 weeks before the competition.

She can now lift twice her own weight and can flip tractor tyres with ease. She also pushes herself hard with high-intensity sprints.

In two years, Lucy has changed so dramatically that she barely recognises the woman she was once was.

She said: 'I've shown that you can do anything if you put your mind to it and I hope to inspire women with my story.'

She added: 'Best of all, my children are so proud of me that they tell everyone they've got a yummy mummy.'
