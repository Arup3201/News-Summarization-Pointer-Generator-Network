A woman who has travelled the world without a scratch has finally found a destination which scares her - a beauty spot in her home town.

Sarah Bowker has come across hundreds of wild animals on her travels in Asia, Africa and even the Amazon rainforest, but came away unscathed from her encounters.

However, while walking her dog in Lancashire, she was bitten by a poisonous snake and had to spend a week in hospital.

Her arm tripled in size and she struggled to breathe, and she was only healed when doctors requested anti-venom from a specialist clinic.

Victim: Sarah Bowker spent a week in hospital after being bitten by an adder in Lancashire

Injury: The 29-year-old was left with a horrible bruise after the encounter with a snake

Hospital: Miss Bowker's arm swelled up to three times its normal size thanks to the bite

Miss Bowker, 29, has been to Peru, Mozambique and Thailand, where she let a boa constrictor coil around her neck, but is now recovering at home in Haslingden.

'I still can't get over that after all the dangerous places I have been in the world it was a snake in Haslingden that nearly killed me,' she said today.

'I've held lion cubs and even had a boa constrictor around my neck in the past, so I guess it's pretty ironic that I get bit by a poisonous snake here in the UK.'

The adventurous young woman was walking around Calf Hey reservoir with her German shepherd Arwen when she was attacked last Thursday.

Danger: Miss Bowker filmed the adder on her mobile phone after it bit her at Calf Hey reservoir

Bizarre: The patient's arms were radically different sizes after she was bitten

Anger: Miss Bowker says the company that owns the site should be more careful about warning people

'I let Arwen have a run around like I usually do and I sat down,' she said. 'The grass was reedy and all different lengths. I put my hand out and from nowhere I felt a sharp sting on my arm just like when you have an injection at the doctors.

'I looked down and there was an adder sliding off through the grass. I was pretty shocked but decided to take some photos and a film in case it wasn't a grass snake and I'd need to identify it.

'Within minutes my arm started to swell and I knew it wasn't a grass snake so I rang the ambulance. By the time it arrived my arm was massive - about three times the size.

'Then my throat and face puffed up and I had trouble breathing. I knew then that it was serious.'

Brave: She also posed for a picture holding a tiger cub during the same holiday

At Royal Blackburn Hospital, doctors were unable to treat her until they were sent anti-venom by reptile experts at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and she went into anaphylactic shock.

'I just remember sitting on a chair then all of a sudden being on the bed with doctors and nurses all around me,' she said. 'The anti-venom came within the hour and as soon as I had that I started to breathe properly again which was a massive relief.

'I had to stay there for six days on IV antibiotics and I think I became a bit of a celebrity on the ward because no one had ever had a patient who'd be bitten by a poisonous snake before.'

Miss Bowker came face-to-face with plenty of venomous beasts during her holiday in the Amazon, but was not injured by them.

Traveller: Now Miss Bowker has vowed to stay away from her local reservoir after her ordeal

Danger: But it was not until she returned to Lancashire that the traveller was hurt by an animal

'There were capybara, which are the largest rodents in the world, various insects such as katydid, as well as monkeys, bird eating spiders which are really big,' she said. 'There were tarantulas and poison frogs too.'

She has vowed never to return to the reservoir, and criticised the facility's owner United Utilities for not putting up warning signs.

A spokesman for the company said: 'We are very sorry to hear that this lady has been injured while enjoying our land.

'Thankfully, attacks like these are extremely rare but we do wish her a speedy recovery.'

Adders, the only poisonous snake native to Britain, bite up to 100 people each year, but there have been just 14 snake-related deaths in the past century.

Dr Robert Harrison, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: 'The lady who has been bitten did the exact right thing by staying as calm as possible.'
