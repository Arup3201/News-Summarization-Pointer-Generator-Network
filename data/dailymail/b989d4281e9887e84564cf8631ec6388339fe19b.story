Trouble: Hunt is thought to have riled up Team England by speaking to the BBC

Andy Hunt, former chief executive and chef de mission of the British Olympic Association, caused meltdown in the Team England camp at the Commonwealth Games by lunchtime on the first day.

Hunt, a special advisor to the board of  Commonwealth Games England, had been directed along with the rest of the hierarchy not to do any media interviews unless it was part of a planned communications strategy.

But Hunt, so keen on publicity that he was known as the ‘celebrity chef’ during London 2012, nevertheless went ahead with a BBC News interview following Jodie Stimpson winning England’s first gold in the women’s triathlon.

And Hunt showed why he shouldn’t have been on air when asked who were now the big hopes for Team England after Mo Farah’s withdrawal.

Hunt, embarrassingly for his colleagues, struggled to name anyone before coming up with a couple, including swimmer Michael Jamieson, who happens to be Scottish. Hunt has since been told by angry Team England officials not to make any more media appearances, but may not be able to help himself.

How long before RandyShunt, the parody twitter account that poked fun at Hunt’s ‘whoopwhoop’ cheerleading during the Olympics, resurfaces?

 

Concept Sports Management, the agency that represents both Welsh athletes Rhys Williams and Gareth Warburton suspended from the Games for failing drugs tests — understood to possibly be linked to supplements — claims to ‘focus on ensuring all our talent receive the best possible advice’.

However, Concept director Steve Griffin would not comment on what specific advice had been given to his two tarnished runners.

The BBC monopoly of the Commonwealth Games stretches to their legion of sports website operatives taking advantage of questions asked by newspaper reporters, who were finally given their chance to talk to Bradley Wiggins and other cyclists after BBC TV and BBC 5 Live had finished their many questions.

A Games spokeswoman said on Friday: ‘That is not right,’ and promised to stop the website from invading newspaper territory.

Meanwhile a temporary studio has been built to house the BBC breakfast show and main Games programming, despite BBC Scotland having their state-of-the-art HQ nearby featuring the biggest TV recording space ever built in Scotland. But it doesn’t offer the ‘iconic view’ of Glasgow that BBC Sport wanted.

 

The Scottish National Party newpaper, distributed in central Glasgow on Friday, included quotes from former Scotland FA boss David Taylor — described as the current boss of UEFA Events — supporting a Yes vote in the referendum. Taylor sadly died last month.

FA probe Roy’s flop

England manager Roy Hodgson’s position may be safe after the World Cup debacle. But at least FA chairman Greg Dyke has reflected in the weeks since the retreat from Rio and listened to his board telling him that not everything about that failed expedition can remain unaffected.

So a working party from the executive will  look at whether the massive support network around Hodgson can be improved or offer better value for considerable costs. Yet operationally the FA couldn’t have prepared better or more professionally. It was the manager who couldn’t get the marginal gains from his chosen squad.

Steven Gerrard’s next Liverpool contract, described by manager Brendan Rodgers as a formality, is sure to reaffirm clauses in the last deal about the talisman captain having a guaranteed five-year ambassador role at the club when his playing career ends. Ambassador positions are increasingly a lucrative option for big names with Alex Ferguson (Man Utd), David Beckham (Sky) and Jose Mourinho (BT) three well-paid examples.

The massive publicity campaign for Sky’s new European football channel is led by a David Beckham-fronted big idea TV ad that jokingly included disgarded proposals of drone cams for cricket. The sensitive drone mention has now gone, with Sky insisting the ad has ‘evolved.’
