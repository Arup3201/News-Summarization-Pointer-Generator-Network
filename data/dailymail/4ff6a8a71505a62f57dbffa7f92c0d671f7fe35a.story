The moment you need to send an urgent text is usually the same moment your battery dies.

But now U.S. engineers claim to have developed a solution that allows you to generate power using 'thin air.'

The technology, known as ‘ambient backscatter’, taps into TV and Wi-Fi signals both for device communication and as a source of power.

As well as powering your mobile, everyday objects could be enabled with battery-free tags to communicate with each other. For instance, a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where his keys were left.

Researchers at Washington University built small, battery-free devices with antennas that can detect, harness and reflect a TV signal, which can be picked up by other similar devices.

Two devices where then shown to communicate with each other by reflecting the existing signals to exchange information.

‘We can repurpose wireless signals that are already around us into both a source of power and a communication medium,’ said Shyam Gollakota, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Washington University.

‘It’s hopefully going to have applications in a number of areas including wearable computing, smart homes and self-sustaining sensor networks.’

Using ambient backscatter, these devices can interact with users and communicate with each other without using batteries. They exchange information by reflecting or absorbing pre-existing radio signals

Ambient backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium.

It enables two battery-free devices to communicate by backscattering existing wireless signals.

Since it uses the ambient radio frequency signals that are already around us, it doesn't require a dedicated power infrastructure.

Eventually, the technology could lead to
 networks of devices and sensors that send data by reflecting existing 
signals to exchange information, without the need for batteries.

‘Our devices form a network out of thin air,’ said co-author Joshua Smith, a Washington University associate professor of computer science and engineering and of electrical engineering.

‘You can reflect these signals slightly to create a Morse code of communication between battery-free devices.’

It could potentially be built into mobiles phones to provide emergency power when the battery has died.

Everyday objects could also be enabled with battery-free tags to communicate with each other. For instance, a couch could use ambient backscatter to let the user know where house keys were left.

Researchers demonstrate how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them. Ambient RF signals are both the power source and the communication medium

Smart sensors could be built and placed permanently inside any structure, then set to communicate with each other.

For example, sensors placed in a bridge could monitor the health of the concrete and steel, then send an alert if one of the sensors picks up a hairline crack.

The researchers tested the ambient backscatter technique with credit card-sized prototype devices placed within several feet of each other.

For each device the researchers built antennas into ordinary circuit boards that flash an LED light when receiving a communication signal from another device.

Groups of the devices were tested in a variety of settings in the Seattle area, including inside an apartment building, on a street corner and on the top level of a parking garage.

These locations ranged from less than half a mile away from a TV tower to about 6.5 miles away.

Researchers then demonstrated how one payment card can transfer funds to another card by leveraging the existing wireless signals around them.

Ambient radio frequency signals became both the power source and the communication medium.

They found that the devices were able to communicate with each other, even the ones farthest from a TV tower.

The receiving devices picked up a signal from their transmitting counterparts at a rate of 1 kilobit per second when up to 2.5 feet apart outdoors and 1.5 feet apart indoors.

This is enough to send information such as a sensor reading, text messages and contact information.

The researchers now hop to advance the capacity and range of the ambient backscatter communication network.
