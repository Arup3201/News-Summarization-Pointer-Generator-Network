Phil Taylor is looking forward to a ‘good scrap’ with Kim Huybrechts in the third round of the World Darts Championship after cruising past Mark Webster.

The 16-time world champion was ruthless in dispatching the Welshman 4-0 to set up a third-round clash with the Belgian, and he warned Huybrechts against jumping around on stage when they meet in the last 16 on Tuesday.

Huybrechts beat Ian White earlier on Sunday at Alexandra Palace, and Taylor said: ‘He is a little jack in the box and jumps around a bit so it’s a matter of keeping him quiet. I’m looking forward to a good scrap.

‘He isn’t going to jump around the stage against me. If he does then there will be trouble. Me and Kim are going to play a proper game of darts.

‘He can jump around as much as he wants, but that’s wasted energy and it isn’t going to work on me.’

Taylor averaged 101.92 in his win over Webster, and feels this is the best chance he will get to win a 17th world title.

‘I’ve had everything right and got everything spot on,’ Taylor said. ‘If I don’t win the World Championship this year then I may never win it again.

‘It’s a big battle and a big fight now. I’m 54 years old and this is the biggest chance I’m ever going to get of winning my 17th.

‘I don’t think you’ve seen me like this for a long time. I’m ready for the 17th win now and ready for a fight and a battle and whatever is thrown at me.’

Taylor believes there is still more in the tank as the tournament reaches the business end, but was happy with his efficient performance.

‘It was nice and steady,’ he said. ‘I’m enjoying it. I’ve had lots of practice and lots of rest. I’ve done everything right for this.

‘Preparation is everything. Roy Keane once said “fail to prepare, prepare to fail” and he is spot on.’

Tottenham winger Andros Townsend was in attendance at the darts along with his dad, Troy. The England international appeared in his side's goalless draw with Manchester United before making his way to Alexandra Palace. 

Adrian Lewis, meanwhile, survived a late-night scare as he came from 2-1 behind to beat 22-year-old Keegan Brown.

The two-time world champion hit a crucial 134 checkout to take the fourth set, and went on to win 4-2 against the world youth champion in a match that featured 14 180s.

Lewis paid tribute to the youngster, saying: ‘He is fantastic. He never gave in and that’s the key to a champion. He is a young lad coming through who nobody wants to come up against.

'I had to dig in deep and keep going at him. I wasn't on my A game by any means but had a 100 average again and if you keep on averaging over 100 you are going to be hard to beat.'

In the first match of the evening session, Dean Winstanley survived a fightback from Darren Webster to win in a final-set shoot-out and seal his place in the last 16.

Winstanley raced into a 2-0 lead before Webster came storming back to win the next three sets.

But after clinching the sixth set to force a decider, Winstanley hit a crucial 79 checkout to break throw in the fifth leg of the final set, and sealed his victory by hitting double eight in the next.
