Crystal Palace have completed the permanent signing of academy product Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United for a fee of £6million.

Despite initially jumping the gun by announcing the deal before United believed the finer details had been finalised - which saw the south Londoners then quickly remove the confirmation from their official website, the club confirmed the deal later on Monday evening.

Zaha left Selhurst Park in 2013, joining Manchester United for £15million, but has since returned to the club on loan after failing to impress at Old Trafford.

The 22-year-old recently claimed he felt back at home playing back at Selhurst Park where he became a fans' favourite before leaving for Manchester United.

He tweeted: 'Glad to be back permanently and appreciate all the messages #CPFC #home' 

Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed under former Man United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013.

But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes.

During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff.

However, Zaha is rejuvenated back at Palace and manager Alan Pardew has decided to keep the talented winger, as he doesn't fall into Louis van Gaal's United plans. 

 Zaha cost United £15million, but the £6million fee back to Crystal Palace is significantly less
