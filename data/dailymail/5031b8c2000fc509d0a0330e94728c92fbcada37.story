Authorities in northern Arizona say a 4-year-old boy has accidentally shot and killed his father at a Prescott Valley home.

The 35-year-old man has been identified as Justin Stanfield Thomas, a military veteran who served in the army special forces.

Prescott Valley police say the shooting occurred just after noon on Friday.

Killed: Justin Thomas, a former military policeman, was accidentally shot dead by his four-year-old son on Friday

Great dad: Thomas was he was an Iraq War veteran and a former member of the Army's Green Beret

He and his young son were visiting from Phoenix and were at a friend's house.

Police say the boy somehow found a gun in the home's living room and accidentally fired it when a bullet hit his father, who was rushed to a hospital where he died.

Jeremy Hart who lives next door and knew all the parties involved explained that his neighbour kept a loaded gun for protection.

The visit was a surprise which may explain why the gun was not locked up or secured. Detectives are calling it a tragic mistake.

Investigation: Police believe the kiling is just a tragic accident but will look to see if there's any negligence issues

Dead: Justin Thomas passed away a short time after being shot. He had recently become a dad for the second time

'At this point, it does appear that this is just a tragic accident from this child, and we will look to see if there's any negligence issues there,' said Prescott Valley police Sgt. Brandon Bonney. 'But, at this point, the information we have is it's just a tragic accident that was unforeseen.'

Friends say Justin Thomas used to live in Prescott Valley before moving to Phoenix.

Police say the boy, who is too young to comprehend what happened, is with his mother and his new born baby brother.
