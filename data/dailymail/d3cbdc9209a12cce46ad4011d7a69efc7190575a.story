A pair of fetish models who allegedly filmed sex scenes featuring them torturing fish, bunnies, and chickens may never see a day in court because the statute of limitations has expired.

Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, performed in the sickening videos roughly a decade ago. A wait that prosecutors say has left them helpless.

The pair were arrested in April after PETA found the online sex scenes, but prosecutors never filed the felony animal cruelty charges they would have otherwise faced.

Sara Zamora, 28, and Stephanie Hird, 29, allegedly tortured and killed animals in videos for a fetish Web site roughly ten years ago, a wait too long for prosecution under the statute of limitations

The girls claimed they were manipulated into performing by a still at-large video director named Adam Redford

Under Miami-Dade County's state attorney the statute of limitations has already expired.

Outside their Thursday court appearance in which the women were set free, Zamora said they were actually victims.

'We were 18 years old and we were manipulated into a situation that we, unfortunately, cannot take back,' she told reporters for Local 10.

Zamora and Hird blamed Adam Redford, a South Florida boat captain who they say made the videos for fetish site 'SOS Barn.'

The fetish videos were discovered earlier this year by PETA, and and the women could have faced felony animal cruelty charges

Zamora pleasured one man while karate chopping bunnies and slitting a chicken's neck with hedge clippers in one video, while in another Hird crushed live fish with her bare hands, abused rabbits, shot rats, and set a pile of vermin ablaze all while wearing a revealing outfit, the Miami Herald reports.

After their arrest, it was reported Zamora faced eight felony charges and Hird five.

'We were manipulated and convinced that these things were alright,' 
Zamora said. 'And unfortunately they were very wrong and now we have to 
pay the consequences, even if it was 10 years ago.'

The models called the videos 'wrong' and said they had paid for their roles on the site

Hird added: 'The truth always comes out. I wasnâ€™t guilty from the get-go. Those were other models.'

Redford, who is listed as a co-defendant in the case, has not been arrested.

'If you're out there Adam Redford, I hope you get everything you deserve,' Zamora told reporters.

As for those who still believe she's tortured and killed animals, Zamora had a message for them.

'They can all go to hell.'
