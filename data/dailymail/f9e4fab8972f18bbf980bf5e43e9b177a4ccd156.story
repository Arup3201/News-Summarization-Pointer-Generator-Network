A widow who lost her 'soul mate and best friend' husband after it took five hours for an ambulance service to get him to hospital has released a harrowing photograph of her last moments together.

Mthuthuzeli Mpongwana, 38, died of meningitis after suddenly being taken ill at his Bristol home on January 5.

His wife Lisa phoned 111, the NHS non-emergency helpline, but she was forced to wait five hours for her rapidly-deteriorating husband to be taken into hospital. 

Two days later, Mrs Mpongwana had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off her husband's life support. He was later found to have died from meningitis of the brain.

The ambulance service who answered her call have apologised, but Mrs Mpongwana insists her husband would still be alive today if it hadn't been for the delay.

Heartbreaking: Lisa Mpongwana posted this image of her husband before he died. Mthuthuzeli died after having to wait five hours before being taken to hospital for meningitis 

Mrs Mpongwana - who described her husband as 'her rock' - said: 'The apology won't bring him back. The doctors and nurses when we got to the hospital were fantastic, but it shouldn't have taken so long to get him there.

'At the beginning my husband was talking and asking questions, by the time they arrived he was completely unresponsive.' 

Mr Mpongwana began feeling unwell at the couple's home in Bedminster, Bristol, and soon became extremely sensitive to light.

His wife phoned the NHS non-emergency number and was told a blue-lights ambulance would be sent straight away.

Two-and-a-half hours later a rapid response car arrived at their home. It took a further three hours for Mr Mpongwana to be taken to hospital, by which point he was seriously ill.

Mrs Mpongwana, 27, said: 'I called 111 because I could see he was bad, he couldn't stand being around lights at all.

'The caller said they would send a blue lights ambulance straight away because they thought it was serious. We then had to wait until 1.30am for one man in a car to arrive.'

Couple: Mrs Mpongwana described her husband as 'her rock' who 'stood by me through my highs and lows'

Grieving: The widow described how she waited for hours while her husband's condition worsened

She added: 'At first he thought it was just the flu and called the GP out-of-hours for advice about whether he should admit him to hospital.

'I don't understand why the paramedic couldn't take him to hospital. He then called for an ambulance but it took until 4.30am for it to arrive.' 

Mrs Mpongwana spent the morning of January 7 in the arms of her husband, but doctors said he had no chance of recovery and she gave her consent for his life support machine to be switched off.

She said: 'I got to sleep with him on Tuesday night. It was so comforting to me. It was something I'm really grateful I got the chance to do.

'The nurse was amazing afterwards. She helped me wash and dress him. She also got some paint and we did hand prints.

'I don't think I will ever have closure but I had the chance to say goodbye. I can't thank her enough.'

Final moments: Mrs Mpongwana said she was pleased she was at her husband's side during his final night

Mrs Mpongwana, who met her husband in September 2011 and married in March 2013, decided to release the photograph to raise awareness of meningitis.

She said: 'I was really hard to share it but I had no choice. People need to see the hurt I went through.

'I don't want sympathy but I want to raise awareness about meningitis. I didn't know the symptoms and I'm sure other people don't either.'

South Western Ambulance Service has now apologised for the dalays.

A spokesman for the service said: 'South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust received a call from the NHS 111 service in Bristol at approximately 11pm to attend a male patient suffering from a headache and fever.

'A Rapid Response Vehicle was dispatched and arrived at the scene at approximately 1.18am. The patient was treated by our crews before being transported to the Bristol Royal Infirmary.'

The spokesman added: 'The trust would like to apologise for the delay in getting to this patient during what was a very busy time.

'We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and would urge them to get in touch so that we can investigate the matter further.'

Hospital: The 38-year-old died after being taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary five hours after taking ill at home 

Mrs Mpongwana is now struggling to pay for a funeral and is appealing for help with the costs.

She said: 'My husband was my soul mate and best friend who stood by me throughout my highs and my lows and when my dad passed away last year at the age of 44 he was my rock.

'My husband's sudden death has caused me a lot of pain and I am really worried that I won't be able to provide a funeral for my husband as I am still paying off my father's funeral.'

Mr Mpongwana's death comes amid a crisis in Britain's A&E wards which has seen ambulances queuing outside hospitals around the country.

Grandmother Monica Lewis, 57, died of a heart attack last week after an ambulance took more than an hour to answer a 999 call.

Two ambulances on the way to her home in Croydon, South London, were diverted to ‘higher priority’ calls.

Yesterday, MailOnline reported the case of a pensioner who was left waiting on the freezing pavement for well over an hour after suffering a suspected broken leg in a fall outside a supermarket in Chester.
