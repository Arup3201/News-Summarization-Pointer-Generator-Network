It's the most talked-about show on TV that's transformed a handful of lucky youngsters  from budding singers to fully-fledged X Factor stars.

While they may look a million dollars when they grace our TV screens, behind the scenes a highly trained glam squad works like a well-oiled machine to ensure that each and every contestant is HD-ready before their performances.

FEMAIL went backstage at X Factor to meet super stylist Gemma Sheppard and hair styling heavyweight Jamie Stevens to discover to secrets behind the singers' transformations.

Backstage beauty: FEMAIL went backstage to the Tresemme hair salon where Jamie Stevens worked his magic on Lola Saunders' hair

Amidst the madness - and away from the prying eyes of Simon Cowell - the Tresemme hair salon is a tranquil haven of calm.

The salon is headed up by Jamie Stevens, who arrives at the studios at 9am, and has between 10 and 45 minutes to work his magic on the singers' hair.

'The contestants are always being pulled from pillar to post but everyone loves coming into the hair salon,' Jamie told us.

'Everyone says it's the fun room, they speak to us more than anyone.' So close have they become to him that when they film their VT every week speaking about the show, they're talking to Jamie - even though you can't see him on camera.

Fun times: Jamie says that the hair salon is the most fun place to be in the studios and the contestants often open up to him about how they're feeling

Get the look: Jamie says he's been championing sleek ponytails, dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys - all modelled by Only The Young

So where does it all begin and how do the contestants' looks materialise from bed hair to beautiful bouffants?

Before the shows kick off, Jamie meets with the contestants and asks them two questions: 'What's the worst thing I could do to your hair and what's the best thing?' 

'I'm not into making people cry,' he joked. 'When we first did Jessy from Little Mix she hated the colour so we coloured it back. Hair is always hero, it's the main accessory you wear 24/7, you can't take it off like makeup.

Not a fan: The team did Fleur East's hair slightly straighter but Simon didn't like it so they had to make it curly again

'The happier the contestants are, the better it is. If Simon loves it and they hate it, it's no good. They have to feel great.'

Every Tuesday Jamie meets with the creative heads and the judges to brainstorm ideas for the coming weekend's show. 'The first year, I had to present mood boards but I've been working on the show for four years so they trust me now,' he said. 

While he says that Cheryl and Mel are 'great' and let him do what he wants, he has come under fire  from Simon.

'This is the third week and there's been one Simon wobble. We did Fleur's hair slightly straighter but Simon didn't like it so we had to change it back,' he said.

'I think this year is different because Simon's back and because he is the big boss, everyone's a little more on edge.'

One contestant who has really noticed Simon's wrath is Lola Saunders. Speaking after the show - and after Simon Cowell predicted she would be in the bottom two - Lola told MailOnline: 'I think I was an emotional wreck but I sort of like hearing the negative comments because it makes you all the more determined.

'Even hearing Simon say I could be in the bottom two made me want to come out fighting.'

Speaking about Saturday night's performance, she said: 'I had a complete nightmare, I was terrible. In the rehearsal my voice went and I was panicking because I wasn't in control of it; that was the main issue and it was just horrible.'

One thing that's helping boost her on-stage confidence is her glam squad. Speaking about her transformation and style haul, she said: 'My hair and what I'm wearing make me feel so much more confident. I love wearing pencil skirts on the show, they definitely help me. On Xtra factor, I am way more confident and everyone is being really nice about my look and it's all thanks to Jamie and Gemma.' 

Before and after: Lola Saunders has become very close to Jamie and his team and says her hair and style makes her feel far more confident on stage

Jamie, who works alongside his hairdresser wife backstage, says he's been championing sleek ponytails, dishevelled party hair and lots of messy plait braids for the girls and the classic quiff for the boys. 

In fact, it's the boys who are the most obsessed with how they look.

'Every year the boys are ten times worse than the girls,' explains Jamie. 'We'll style them at 11am and they'll be back at 12 asking for more hairspray. I've banned the use of hairspray until an hour before the show. We get through fifteen cans a week - just on the boys.'

Sharing his tips and tricks, he explains how he 'uses things in a non conventional way. 'We generate a lot of static in our hands but if you spray the hair and they use the corners of the can to smooth it down and dry it with a hairdryer, it works well. Plus, dust in braids is a godsend.' 

Style guru: Gemma has worked with Dannii Minogue in the past and is honoured to be styling this year's X Factor contestants

Fresh from this weekend's show, Jamie is already planning big things for next weekend - and he is seriously excited. 

'Next week is going to be incredible, I'd say the most fun show I've ever worked on in four years. It's Halloween and it's going to be the most Halloweeny the show has ever been, they're going all out.'

X Factor may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not, the contestants are also judged on what they're wearing.

But they don't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of style gurus backstage.

Heading up the style squad is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows.

FEMAIL were keen to find out the entire dressing process, who her favourite judge is and how she copes with Simon Cowell's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things X Factor.

Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good.

'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.'

She couldn't be happier with the group, who make her job all the more enjoyable.

'The contestants really are an amazing group, all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect.'

As well as the contestants, Gemma works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both Cheryl and Mel's style.

She said: 'The girls are gorgeous, they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines.

'Mel's make-up is exquisite but I simply couldn't choose between the two as they're both equally distinctive and stunning.' 

The X Factor Stylist, Jamie Stevens, says: ‘This week we toned down Lauren’s ombrè colour with a full head of highlights. Her look this week is inspired by fairytale Princesses but we’ve given the classic braid a modern twist to keep her look youthful and playful.’ 

STEP 1: Prep hair with TRESemmé Renewal Hair and Scalp Shampoo (RRP £4.99) and Conditioner (RRP £4.99). Apply TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Amplifying Mousse (RRP £4.00) onto towel dried hair, working product through from roots to ends whilst blow drying. 

STEP 2: Divide hair into 2-3 inch diagonal sections, adding hair as you go, keeping the braids the same width, repeat three times. Dust with TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Plumping Powder (RRP £5.50) for ultimate root lift and texture. Secure with pins and tease with fingertips for added volume and thickness. 

STEP 3: Tong the ends using a medium wand and spritz with TRESemmé Ultimate Hold Hairspray (RRP £4.99) to secure in place

X Factor judge Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's lavish diamond jewellery was so valuable she reportedly wasn't allowed to wear it outside the TV studios.

Bling bling: Cheryl wore dazzling diamonds, combined with a chic black Zuhair Murad floor-length gown

The TV star looked stunning on Saturday's show in dazzling diamonds, combined with a chic black Zuhair Murad floor-length gown.

Jeweller to the stars Vashi Dominguez revealed it would simply be too dangerous for an A-list star like Cheryl to wear such expensive jewels outside a safe environment.

He said: 'Cheryl totally stole the show on Saturday with her stunning diamonds. She really showed how you can stand-out by wearing some breath-taking creations.

'But the Cheryl look does not come cheap and there are obvious security concerns if you wear diamonds of that quality outside the very safest places.

'Cheryl very sensibly took off her diamond necklace and cuff before leaving the studios on Saturday. 

'I imagine her security insisted upon it, though she kept on her £15,000 diamond earrings.'

The singer wore Garrard Wings 10th Anniversary Necklace, which costs £380,000 and Garrard Wings 10th Anniversary Bangle, which costs£65,000.
