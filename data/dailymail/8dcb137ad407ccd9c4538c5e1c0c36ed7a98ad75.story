An idiot-proof type wrapping paper has been designed to help men who struggle to present neatly-covered gifts.

The 'Man Wrap' does not require scissors or Sellotape, and nor does it involve the user having to make fiddly folds in the ends.

Users simply roll it out, place the gift in the middle of it, tear off a strip and twist it around the present to secure it in place.

Martin Grix has created 'Man Wrap' to help men who struggle to wrap presents neatly. It does not require scissors, Sellotape or any fiddly folding

It was created by designer Martin Grix, who noticed the sheer number of men who found the wrapping process so difficult that some even resorted to using bin liners.

He came up with the 'Man Wrap' as a solution. The tube of decorative paper provides 16ft of gift-wrap with a width of 8ins to coat small presents such as boxes and bottles.

Mr Grix, 39, from Clapham, south London, said: ‘Generally, there have always been men moaning about wrapping up presents and women who are more particular about it.

‘My brother actually wrapped my stuff up one year in bin bags and I have heard of other men using kitchen tin foil.

‘I wanted to make something you could quickly wrap and look nice, so I started trying to find a way to make it easier. I initially looked at cling film but it wouldn't work.

‘We settled on using a tin foil style and selected a certain thickness and type before deciding on the blue and silver stars theme.

‘I took it to a trade show and women were saying “even a bloke could use this” which helped it get the name.

‘It has instructions on the back of the packaging to show people how to use it, but you simply have to rip it and wrap it.

‘It's a bit like Marmite, people really like it or they don't, but we have had some great feedback.’

The ‘Man Wrap’ costs £4.99 and is available from www.themonsterfactory.com
