The 22-year-old New York fashionista 
who ended her life by jumping off the George Washington Bridge after a Facebook spat last week has been laid to rest.

Nearly 200 mourners gathered at Our Lady 
of Visitation in Paramus, New Jersey on Wednesday to remember Ashley Riggitano as a talented, outgoing fashion-lover with a bright future.

She took her life on her 22nd birthday after a Facebook feud over her boyfriend,  aspiring race car driver Drew Heissenbuttel. He did not attend the funeral, according to Hollywood Life.

In a suicide note found in her Louis Vuitton bag on the bridge, Riggitano had mentioned a man she was 'not happy with', and listed the names of five women banned from her funeral service.

A friend had said that the women, who
Riggitano believed were bullying her, would be politely asked to leave 
if they turned up at the funeral.

During the service, her 25-year-old sister, Jennifer Riggitano, their happy childhood filled with make up and tree houses, the New York Post reported.

'I'll miss the laughter that only 
Ashley, in her bold, bubbly way, could bring into a room,' she said. 'I will miss our diva dates getting manicures and 
pedicures. I will miss those phone calls that started with, 'Don’t tell 
Mom".'

A mourner added to HollywoodLife: 'Ashley’s boyfriend didn’t show up to 
the funeral - which is sad. Her parents and sister, however, were in the
front pew, as her casket laid in the center of the aisle - it was 
elegant and beautiful, all white.'

Last week it was revealed that Ashley
posted a parting Facebook message just minutes before taking she jumped
off the bridge on her 22nd birthday.

'Just like anyone want to be spoke. 
to nice, so would I,' she wrote in a misspelled status 
update at 4.29pm Wednesday. 'Love those who treat you right all the time
not some.'

Ten minutes later, the young jewellery designer leaped to her death into the frigid waters of the Hudson River.

The troubled beauty had been in an 
online spat with five young women, among them school friends, her 
business partner and an acquaintance, whom she had perceived to be her 
enemies.

'People make others lived [sic] 
miserable because they satisfaction and victory, and need constant 
attention and be the top be better,' read her final post cited by the New York Post.

On Friday, the quintet of 'frenemies' mentioned by Riggitano in her grudge list were identified by a New York Post source as Alison Tinari, Teresa Castaldo, Beth Bassil, 
Riggitano's best friend and business partner, Victoria Van Thunen, and 
Samantha Horneff.

'Go try 
to kill yourself on Xanax again, you untable [sic] loser. Go f*** 
yourself and never speak to me again,' Tinari wrote in a Facebook 
message directed at Riggitano. 

Before her suicide, Riggitano’s 
father had been concerned about his daughter being the victim of 
bullying, law enforcement sources told The Post.

A family friend told Hollywood Life
that while Ashley did suffer from depression, that should not 
overshadow her life, adding: 'She put up a hard fight. Her favorite book
was Eat Pray Love and she highlighted it and put post-its all over her 
ebook and her apartment would have sayings from the book everywhere.

'She
would talk to her mom and sister about their life path. She did 
everything she could to pull herself out of the depression. She was a 
fabulous girl.'

The friend 
added that if any of the girls included Ashley's suicide note turned up 
to the funeral 'they will be politely asked to leave.'

Riggitano
and Van Thunen ran together their own jewellery business called 
Missfits. Castaldo and Bassil were the 22-year-old's former classmates 
at Laboratory Institute of Merchandising (LIM), and Horneff was a friend from New Jersey.

'To any funeral, these people should 
not be allowed based upon words and actions,' Riggitano wrote in her 
notes about the five women.

Riggitano singled out a man who she was not happy with, and although he was 
permitted to attend her funeral, she added that she hoped he 'gets what 
he deserves' when he gets there.

She also mentioned three others by first name only, calling them 'only people I love & always there to tell sorry.'

'All my other "friends" are in it for gossip,' she wrote, according to the New York Post.

Business: Ashley Riggitano and Victoria Van Thunen launched their business in May 2011

It is believed that earlier in the day, Victoria Van Thunen wrote on her Facebook 
page: ‘Those who incessantly blame others as the cause of 
their issues should perhaps take a step back and reevaluate these 
situations. The common thread may be that “they” aren’t the problem, but
rather that YOU are.’

The newspaper reported that Miss Riggitano may have had a history of problems and tried to commit suicide at least once before.

Medication, including Adderall and Klonopin, was found in her bag, according to sources.

Adderall
is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
or narcolepsy, while Klonopin is used to control seizures in epilepsy 
and for the treatment of panic disorder.

In early January, Riggitano had a 
two-day Facebook spat with Tinari over her friendship with the jewellery
designer's boyfriend, aspiring race car driver Drew Heissenbuttel.

Couture girl: Alison Riggitano's employer said the 22-year-old intern appeared very put together and had a distinct New York city style

Popular: Alex Woo said the fashion community embraced Riggitano for her sharp sense of style

The message cited by The Post read in
part: 'since drew cannot take care of the issue at hand, I will. You 
have been nothing but a b**** to me every time you walked in the door 
ignoring my existence maybe because you were so concerned with picking 
up your drugs...

'Everyone 
who has spoken to me when i came into the picture told me all about you 
and his friends had nothing good to say except you used Drew for his 
money.'

Tinari denied the allegations of drug use in a text message to the paper.

The
23-year-old responded to the rant with an angry, profanity-laced 
message which stated: 'Tinari fired off an angry response. “If you think
I have time for your bulls*** think again. I don’t give two s***s about
you. I did not post anything of facebook or instagram for you to see.

'I
cannot believe you think I give a f***, i have better things to do with
my time than to stir the pot with some bitch i dont even know . . . 
Leave me the f*** alone. I’m not playing these childish games with you. 
F*** off you pathetic loser.'

Death: Miss Riggitano leapt from George Washington Bridge at 4:40 p.m. yesterday into the Hudson River

Tinari told The Post that the 22-year-old was not 
her friend, and that she had told the woman to leave her alone.

'It’s really horrible what happened. I feel really bad for her family,' Tinari said. 'I never went after her; she went after me.

'The only thing I’m ashamed of is what I said about her overdosing on Xanax. I shouldn’t have said that,' Tinari conceded.

Horneff,
one of the five women on the grudge list, said she had been friends 
with Riggitano for eight years, and she was stunned to be among the 
people banned from her funeral.  

The
mother of Riggitano's LIM classmate, Castaldo, told the paper that her 
daughter had known each other only from school and were otherwise not 
close.

Miss Riggitano had been working as intern for the New York-based jewelry and fashion designer Alex Woo.

In a phone interview with MailOnline Thursday, Woo, who employed Riggitano as a part-time intern, said everyone in the company was stunned by the news of her suicide.

‘She always had a smile on her face, she didn’t look depressed,’ Miss Woo said.

The 22-year-old started her own 
business, called 
Missfits, where she hand crafted jewelry made out of semi precious 
gemstones with her best friend Victoria Van Thunen. The company has been
raising money for a young Bergen County boy named Nico who is battling 
cancer.
