Ravel Morrison has been told he can quit West Ham after he called in the PFA to settle a dispute over his £15,000-a-week wages.

The troubled forward is being repeatedly fined by the Hammers for misconduct and has been told to find another club in the January transfer window.

Morrison, 21, is being represented by the PFA in his case with West Ham, but the club insist they have followed internal disciplinary procedures for their players.

The former Manchester United youngster has been demoted to train with the Under 21 development squad as the saga continues.

He has not played for West Ham since the 3-1 defeat at Upton Park against Southampton back on August 31.

Morrison was loaned to Championship side Cardiff, but the spell in south Wales was not a success and he returned to the Hammers after a 0-0 draw with Rotherham no December 6.

Although Sam Allardyce recognises Morrison’s ability, the Hammers’ manager has been unable to get the best out of him since he arrived from Old Trafford in 2012. 

Morrison has been sent out on loan spells to Birmingham, QPR and most recently Cardiff to help his development. 

He is known for being a disruptive influence, but Allardyce was convinced that he could tame the England Under 21 forward.

Instead he is looking for a new club, but is refusing to leave until the PFA have resolved his outstanding salary issues with the Hammers.

Morrison also has a court case starting on January 26 over allegations that he assaulted his girlfriend and her mother in July last year.
