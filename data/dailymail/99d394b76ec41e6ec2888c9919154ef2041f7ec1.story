A mother died after eating soup she made using one of the world’s deadliest mushrooms which she had unwittingly picked in her garden.

Keen gardener Christina Hale found the death cap mushrooms beneath some mature oak and fir trees and mistook them for an edible type.

In fact the fungus – Amanita phalloides – contains one of the most lethal of all toxins and is the most common cause of death in humans from mushroom poisoning. Just half a cap is enough to kill.

Christina Hale, 57, accidentally picked death cap mushrooms (left, file photo) when foraging for fresh mushrooms to add to a tin of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup she was preparing for dinner

Mrs Hale, 57, added the ones she had 
picked to a tin of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup which she heated 
and ate with her husband Jocelyn, an inquest heard yesterday. Shortly 
afterwards they became ill with vomiting and diarrhoea.

A doctor who visited their home in 
Bridgwater, Somerset, the next day thought Mrs Hale had the norovirus, 
and decided against sending her to hospital for fear of infecting other 
patients.

But the following day the couple, who 
had four children between them, were taken to hospital where Mrs Hale 
was put into intensive care. She died the next day after suffering 
multiple organ failure.

The death cap is the most dangerous mushroom, responsible for 95 per cent of all deaths from mushroom poisoning worldwide.

The deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in 54AD and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 are said to have been caused by eating death caps.

Patients die from organ failure within a few days unless they have a kidney and liver transplant.

Death caps are common across Europe and contain about 20 different poisons.

The strength of the main poison, alpha-Amanitin, is not reduced by freezing or cooking.

Mr Hale, a 49-year-old property 
developer who had eaten less of the soup, survived.

He told the inquest 
in Taunton: ‘We had picked mushrooms before from the garden and put them
 into mushroom soup. She hadn’t done it on her own before.

'I had a bowl 
of soup that she had given me and then had stew. The wife didn’t like it
 because it had butter beans in it so she had more soup. She made the 
soup her main meal.’

Doctors say that even if Mrs Hale had 
been taken to hospital within hours of consuming the mushrooms last 
November, she had eaten so many it is unlikely she would have survived.

She died at the Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton.

West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose, 
who recorded a verdict of misadventure, said: ‘One should never pick 
mushrooms, particularly under trees, unless you know exactly what you 
are picking.

'The problem with this mushroom is that if you do taste it, 
it does not taste unpleasant.’

The death cap appears most commonly under oaks. It grows to between three and six inches high.

Poisoning symptoms, including stomach 
pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, tend to appear ten to 16 hours after 
consumption, and can then ease.

But the toxins continue to attack the 
body and death typically occurs six to 16 days after consumption from 
liver or kidney failure.
