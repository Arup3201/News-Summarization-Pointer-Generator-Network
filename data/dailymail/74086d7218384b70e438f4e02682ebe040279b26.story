Targeted: Stephen Close was threatened with arrest

A gay man claims he’s been labelled a 'serious criminal' by police because of a relationship he had in the army 30 years ago.

Officers threatened 50-year-old Stephen Close with arrest unless he provided a DNA sample as part of a controversial crime crackdown

Mr Close was sentenced to six months in prison in 1983 after he admitted having sex with a male colleague while serving with the Royal Fusiliers in Berlin.

Although homosexuality was decriminalised in 1967 it remained an offence in the armed forces until 1994 and the ban on homosexuals serving in the British Military was not lifted until 2000.

Mr Close, from Salford, was discharged from the army after being charged with gross indecency and he was later convicted of sexual assault in a military court as both he and his partner were under 21, the legal age of consent for gay sex at the time.

He said he was stunned when police arrived at his home last Sunday and demanded he provide a DNA sample.

He said: 'If you look at the details of my criminal record, I can’t see what possible threat I’m meant to pose to the public and why I’ve been targeted by police.I find it completely ridiculous.'

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said they were 'concerned about the particular issues' Mr Close’s case had raised.

The force launched Operation Harvest last year in a bid to collect DNA samples from 2,000 people convicted of serious crimes.

The operation, using controversial new 
powers under the Crime and Security Act 2010, saw samples added to a DNA
database in a bid to match suspects to unsolved crimes.

If ex-offenders refuse to provide a sample, officers have the power under the act to force them to comply.

The
act Mr Close was convicted for is no longer illegal as the age of 
homosexual sex was lowered to 18 in 1994 and then 16 in 2001.

He told the Manchester Evening News: 'If I did the same thing today, it would not longer be considered illegal. Yet the police still want my DNA on record and to me it just begs the question ‘why?’”

GMP’s deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins said that DNA samples from convicted offences allowed the force to 'look for potential matches with DNA evidence recovered from previously unsolved crimes.'

But he added: 'We do understand the very personal and sensitive issues that Mr Close has raised.

'We are concerned about the particular issues his case raises and therefore we would invite him to make direct contact with Greater Manchester Police so we can review his case.'
