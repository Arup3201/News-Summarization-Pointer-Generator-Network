If his pleading eyes aren’t enough to get someone to rehome him, Willow the greyhound can always rely on his luxuriant coat to seal the deal.

Not his natural fur one, fetching as it is, but a little green number created by top British fashion designer Trevor Pickett, which even comes with the little extra incentive of a couple of hip flasks to make walkies fly by.

Former racing greyhound Willow, six, was one of 15 dogs from Battersea Dogs Home chosen to model a range of designer petwear at a charity gala last night.

Outfits for the Collars & Coats ball at Battersea Evolution in London were created by some of fashion’s biggest names, including Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney, Jenny Packham and Julien Macdonald.

Former racing greyhound Willow, six, was one of 15 lucky pooches from Battersea Dogs Home chosen to model a range of designer dog wear at the Collars and Coats gala ball in London.

Held at London’s iconic venue, Battersea 
Power Station, the animal extravaganza was hosted by the TV presenter 
Amanda Holden and the comedian Paul O’ Grady.

Other dog-loving celebrities included the heiress Tamara Ecclestone who looked her typically glamorous self in a shimmering gown.

She said:‘I love dogs, I am literally 
obsessed. I’ve got two dogs and my sister’s got seven dogs so together 
we’ve got nine dogs between us and I think Battersea is an amazing 
cause.

I just feel so sad when I see their faces. I’d love to give them 
all a home, but I think my dogs might get a bit a jealous.’

As well as the chosen fifteen, there was
the Guard of Honour, a parade of forty blue-coated Battersea dogs and 
their handlers who lined the red carpet to greet the celebrity guests.

Once inside the historic venue, the four-legged mutts strutted down the purpose built ‘dogwalk’ to showcase to their designer coats.

With prices starting at £350 a head, guests were treated to a grand banquet and three course meal by a Michelin-starred chef.

Following the feast, revellers were invited to partake in an auction, where the high-rollers could bid up to.. for a designer coat and get their dog’s tails wagging in time for Christmas.

All proceeds from the banquet and the auction went towards the Battersea Dog’s home charity.

Singer Joss Stone provided the entertainment performing songs from her latest album Soul Sessions.

It marked a rare UK appearance for the 25-year-old who is currently half was through a world tour.

Miss Stone was joined by the musician Jamie Cullum, 33, who livened up the evening with some classic Jazz tracks.

Last week it was announced that the diminutive singer is expecting this second child with his model wife, Sophie Dahl.

Other celebrities, including Rebecca Adlington (pictured left), also attended the event where Battersea Dogs Home pooches modelled designer wear

The annual Coats and Collars ball is a
celebration of the Battersea Dogs Home charity which has been helping 
London’s unwanted animals for 152 years.

At the event, Amanda Holden said: ‘I’ve got a mixed
race dog, its a cross between a Yorkshire terrier and a Jack Russell. 
I’d love to adopt a dog from Battersea but my husband is threatening 
divorce if I come home with a dog.’

Also attending was Gary Lineker who said: ‘We’ve got a 
labrador, we’d love more but we travel too much. But he’s a crazy dog, 
he’s a lunatic. I go running with him every morning to keep fit. He 
can’t keep up. Or maybe its me that can’t keep up.’
