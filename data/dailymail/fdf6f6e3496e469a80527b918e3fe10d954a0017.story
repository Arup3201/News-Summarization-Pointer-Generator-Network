Turkish foreign minster Ahmet Davutoglu warned Syria today it would retaliate 'without hesitation' if its border was violated again.

Turkey's armed forces have repeatedly responded in kind over the past few weeks to gunfire and shelling spilling across from Syria.

Now they have promised a more forceful military retaliation if the violence is not contained.Â

Davutoglu turned up the pressure as 
Turkey's prime minister sharply criticized the UN Security Council for 
its failure to agree on decisive steps to end the 19-month civil war in 
Syria.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan told an international conference in Istanbul that the world was witnessing a humanitarian tragedy in Syria.

'If we wait for one or two of the permanent members ... then the future of Syria will be in danger,' said Erdogan, according to an official translator.

He added: 'The council has not intervened in the human tragedy that has been going on in Syria for 20 months, despite all our efforts.

'There's an attitude that encourages, gives the green light to Assad to kill tens or hundreds of people every day,'

Criticism: Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan

Davutoglu held talks today with Arab and European leaders and was due to meet later with 
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle and the UN's envoy on Syria 
Lakhdar Brahimi.

On Wednesday, Turkey intercepted a 
Syrian passenger plane en route from Moscow to Damascus and seized what 
it said was military equipment on board.

Syria denounced the move as air piracy, while Russia said the cargo was radar parts that complied with international law.

Russia and China - two of the five permanent members of the Security Council - have vetoed resolutions that sought to put concerted pressure on Damascus to end the conflict and agree to a political transition.

President Bashar al-Assad's army were reported to have clashed with rebel units on several fronts around the country.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said regime forces were pounding the rebel stronghold of Homs in central Syria with mortars and artillery.

The southern province of Daraa, the birthplace of the revolt, also sustained shelling by the Syrian army throughout the day.

Fighting between army troops and rebels raged around Idlib province and in and around the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest city and a former business hub.

Meanwhile,Syria's state-run news agency reported that Damascus supported a proposal by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to find a 'mechanism of direct security communication between Syria and Turkey.'

More than 32,000 people have been reportedly killed
since the revolt started in March 2011 while hundreds of thousands of Syrians have fled the fighting that has 
devastated whole neighborhoods in Syria's cities and towns.
