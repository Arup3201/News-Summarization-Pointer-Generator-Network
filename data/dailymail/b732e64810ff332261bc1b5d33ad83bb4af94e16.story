Liverpool target Alexandre Lacazette is not looking for a move in the January transfer window, according to Lyon boss Hubert Fournier.

The striker has already scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 this season and has reportedly caught the attention of Liverpool.

With the Reds struggling in front of goal this season, Lacazette would be seen as the ideal man to help the Anfield side find the back of the net.

Lacazette took his Ligue 1 goal tally to 17 on Sunday, scoring for Lyon in a 5-0 victory over Bordeaux

However, with Lyon sitting second in the league table behind leaders PSG, Fournier believes the France international is happy to remain at the Stade de Gerland. 

‘I’m not the best person to speak about it. If it was only up to me, of course I would like him to stay,’ Fournier told RMC.

‘But the president has rather reassured me, and above all, I don’t get the impression Alexandre wants to leave during the January transfer window.’
