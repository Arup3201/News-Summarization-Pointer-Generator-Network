Emotional: Oscar Pistorius sheds a tear during the cross examination of witnesses in his murder trial

Oscar Pistorius today broke down into tears as a ballistics experts described how bullets fired by the athlete killed his girlfriend.

Captain Chris Mangena told Pretoria High Court how Pistorius was standing at least seven feet from 
the closed toilet door when he shot through it at a 'slightly downwards angle', killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Captain Mangena said the bullets entered 
the toilet door below the shoulder level of Pistorius, if he were 
standing without prosthetic limbs.

Pistorius has always maintained he was on his stumps when he fired.

Prosecutors do not dispute the
 assertion, after initially alleging he was on his prosthetic limbs when
 he fired a total of four shots, three of which hit 29-year-old Ms Steenkamp.

Captain Mangena said that only one of the four shots ricocheted inside the lavatory, hitting the wall twice and breaking the tiles.

But he said the other three bullets 'disappeared somewhere between the door and the wall,' adding that he believed that had hit the 'target' straight away.

It is believed Ms Steenkamp was by the toilet in the bathroom when she was killed, but it has not yet been established during the trial whether she was sitting down on it.

Captain Mangena said he used thin rods and the beam from a laser mounted on a 
tripod to try to determine the trajectory of the bullets through the 
door.

He also described
 entry and exit wounds on Ms Steenkamp's right arm and her head, and 
bruises on her chest where a 'projectile' struck without penetrating.

It comes as a gun expert today said the athlete, who has passed a test on gun safety, 'broke every rule in the book' when he shot his girlfriend.

Pistorius, 27, is charged with 
premeditated murder for killing Reeva Steenkamp, 29.

Aftermath of the killing: This picture of Oscar Pistorius, bare-chested and covered in blood from the waist down, was taken by police shortly after the Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp at his home

Shocking: Blood can be seen down the athlete's left arm and on his shorts apparently from when he carried his dead girlfriend down the stairs after shooting her in the bathroom

Horrific: Blood is splattered all over the toilet where Miss Steenkamp was shot by Pistorius

He denies murder and says
 he shot his girlfriend accidentally, thinking she was an intruder in a 
toilet cubicle in the bathroom of his home.

Pistorius claims he then struck the toilet door 
with a cricket bat to get to Steenkamp after realizing what he had done.

But Andre Pritorius, the man who wrote 
the gun safety exam that Pistorius and all South Africans take before getting 
licensed to own a gun, told ABC News
 that shooting Steenkamp through a bathroom door violated a key rule on 
the test which states a shooter must know what or who the target is.

He
 said: 'That came as a big surprise to the general public because ... he
 got the answers correct when he took the test not too long ago, but 
unfortunately the night of the shooting he's broken every rule.'

Meanwhile Pretoria High Court was 
told earlier on Tuesday how police crime scene pictures appear to suggest key 
evidence was moved by officers which would be a breach of investigation 
procedures.

Evidence: The bullet holes and shattered wood where Pistorius struck the door are clearly seen here

Clues: Based on the angle and height of the four bullet holes seen here, Pistorius fired his gun on his stumps, the court heard

In the spotlight: Pistorius is photographed by members of the public as he leaves the court

Warrant Officer Bennie van Staden took hundreds of photos of the scene at Pistorius's Pretoria home in the hours after the double-amputee athlete killed Miss Steenkamp before dawn on February 14 last year

The
 pictures included blood marks found in the property, bullet casings, a 
gun and a cricket bat found inside Pistorius's bathroom.

Police photographer van Staden 
admitted some of the photos suggest evidence had been moved by officers during 
the evidence gathering process.

The
 revelation came as chief defense lawyer Barry Roux challenged previous 
police witnesses, seeking to uncover contradictions and reported mishaps
 to support his argument that officers bungled the investigation.

Roux
 minutely examined many photos taken by van Staden and another police 
officer and pointed out that objects at the crime scene had been moved 
and were in different positions in photos.  

Roux
 also used time of day records on the images to show that the two 
policemen taking photographs were in the same room at points, even 
though van Staden testified he was working alone.

Roux
 compared photos of the bloody bathroom scene taken by van Staden with 
photos in the bathroom taken by another policeman, identified as a Col. 
Motha. Both were in the bathroom at that time, according to the times 
shown on the images.

Hearing: The court heard that police photographs show evidence was moved by officers at the Paralympic athlete's home in the hours following Reeva Steenkamp's death. Pistorius is pictured in the dock on Tuesday

Graphic: A police picture taken at the scene of the cricket bat Pistorius says he used to break down the toilet door after he accidentally shot Miss Steenkamp. The court heard on Tuesday that police photographs suggest the bat was moved by officers in violation of investigation procedures

Testimony: Police photographer Bennie van Staden admitted in court on Tuesday that images from the scene at Pistorius's home suggest there was 'movement of the bat'

Pistorius'
 lawyer also asked van Staden to explain differences in photographs of 
the 9 mm pistol that Pistorius used to shoot Steenkamp through a closed 
toilet door, and of a cricket bat that the Paralympian used to hit the 
door.

'It seems there was movement of the bat' in the interval between two photographs taken by van Staden, Roux said.

'It seems like that,' van Staden conceded.

The
 police photographer also acknowledged that two photographs of the gun 
indicated that a mat underneath it could have been shifted.

Roux said one photo also differed from the other because it showed a wooden splinter on the gun handle.

Two
 other photos of objects on the bedroom floor next to Pistorius' bed 
showed tissues, what was identified as a CD or disc and a remote control
 were in different positions.

Van Staden said he did not know who moved them, but he remembered the disc was previously under the bed.

'How does it happen that there's such a great disturbance of that scene?' Roux asked.

Roux
 was trying to build a picture of a cluttered and confused crime scene 
with many officers working on it and possibly contaminating the 
evidence.

Van Staden has 
said he also took nine photographs of Pistorius soon after the shooting,
 with the athlete seen in some of the images standing in blood-stained 
prosthetic legs and wearing blood-soaked shorts in the garage of his 
home.

Van Staden's 
testimony on Tuesday was delayed by over an hour to give the policeman 
time to collect photo records and discs at the defense's request.

Van
 Staden had said he would have to retrieve photo records from office 
administration, but then said Tuesday he had forgotten that he was 
actually in possession of the master copies of the shooting scene 
photographs.

Pistorius appeared emotional throughout much of the hearing on Tuesday.

hearing.

Before proceedings got underway, journalists in the courtroom 
reported Arnold Pistorius introduced himself to Mrs Steenkamp and 
offered his condolences.

The introduction was the latest of a series of attempts by Pistorius's family to reach out to the Steenkamps.

The case was adjourned Tuesday afternoon and Captain Mangena will continue giving the rest of his evidence on Wednesday.
