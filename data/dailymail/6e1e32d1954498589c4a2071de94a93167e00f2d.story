A woman wearing an ‘abusive wife’ costume was arrested for beating up her boyfriend in Detroit, Michigan, on Saturday night.

Cristina Crespo, 26, and her unnamed boyfriend were participating in a Halloween pub crawl when they were spotted by police outside the Mojave Cantina at around 9pm.

Patrol officers stopped to check on Crespo, who was clearly intoxicated and lying on the sidewalk.

A friend managed to get Crespo on her feet and helped her inside the cantina, but the officers decided to follow to check on her welfare.

Clawson Police Lt. Scott Sarvello said that the officer followed Crespo inside and found her ‘sitting outside behind the cantina.’

‘She said they were there for a pub crawl and she was dressed up as an abusive wife,’ Sarvello told the Daily Tribune.

The officer then tracked down Crespo's boyfriend, who was dressed up as an ‘abused husband’ which entailed a stream of fake blood running from his nose.

The boyfriend confirmed to the officer that the couple had a designated driver, and he agreed to collect their things and leave.

As the officer exited the cantina, he heard shouting and went to investigate.

He found Crespo ‘screaming and repeatedly hitting the boyfriend with her purse’ and tried to intervene, but Crespo ‘continued to be loud and belligerent and was detained.’

‘It’s ironic that she went out dressed up as an abuser and that’s what she ended up as,’ said Sarvello.

Crespo had a blood-alcohol level of .19 – more than twice the .08 legal limit for driving in Michigan.

She was booked on a charge of misdemeanor assault and battery but released a short time later after posting 10 percent of her $5,000 bond.

Crespo is due back in court on November 6 and is prohibited from consuming alcohol or contacting her boyfriend in the meantime.
