Fraud: Roberta Packman, 58, was jailed for 28 weeks after admitting falsely claiming more than £38,000 in benefits. She was filmed by investigators playing a round of golf at Stony Holme golf club in Cumbria

A benefit cheat who claimed she couldn't walk unaided was caught on camera playing a round of golf.

Roberta Packman, 58, had said she was in continuous pain and claimed more than £38,000 in state handouts.

But investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions followed her to Stony Holme Golf Club in Carlise, Cumbria where she was filmed playing a full 18 holes with ease.

Packman, from Cumrew, near Penrith, was jailed for 28 weeks at Carlisle Crown Court.

She had claimed £38,489 in both severe disability premium, income support and disability living allowance between 2006 to 2011.

But she failed to notify the 
Department of Work and Pensions that her circumstances had changed and 
admitted two counts of falsely claiming disability benefits at an 
earlier hearing in November.

Carlisle Crown Court's Recorder, Kevin 
Grice, said: 'I can only conclude that your motivation was simply one of
greed and a wish for financial gain, in my view, for this prolonged 
course of dishonesty by which a significant amount of benefits were 
obtained to which you were not entitled.'

'Greed': Judge Kevin Grice said Packman had been motivated by 'greed' as he jailed her for 28 weeks at Carlisle Crown Court

'We're also cracking down on benefit fraud on the front line, and our investigators work tirelessly to catch these thieves and bring them to justice.

'The vast majority of those on benefits are law abiding people who need our help.

'But for those who try to cheat the system, our message is very clear - you are committing a crime, and we will catch you.'
