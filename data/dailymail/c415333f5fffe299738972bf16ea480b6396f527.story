David Cameron’s populist attacks on immigration risk ‘destroying the future’ of the British people, a senior EU official has claimed in an extraordinary attack on an elected Prime Minister.

Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European Commission, accused Mr Cameron of fuelling fears of an 'invasion' and claimed Britons claiming ‘much more’ in benefits than EU migrants.

It is the latest broadside from the continent aimed at the Prime Minister since he complained about child benefit being exported across the EU and urged other European leaders to curb immigration.

Attack: Viviane Reding, vice-president of the European Commission, accused David Cameron of fuelling populist rhetoric about and immigration 'invasion'

Mr Cameron has made clear that tackling immigration from Europe would be a key demand of his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

Taking part in an online web chat, Miss Reding said Mr Cameron was using populist attacks on Europe to win votes, to the detriment of the Bririth people.

‘The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections,’ she said.

‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [in Britain]. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually.

Pressure: The Prime Minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of Britain's EU membership to tackle immigration

‘What the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out.

“And those who take out of social security are much more the [UK] nationals than the European Union citizens, who take advantage of the free movement of people.

‘It’s just a myth to speak about an invasion, this invasion is just not taking place.’

At the weekend Mr Cameron said: ‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’

The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union.

He added: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.’

But the remarks triggered an angry response from Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Mr Cameron of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules.

Mr Sikorski said: ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British taxpayers’ children?’
