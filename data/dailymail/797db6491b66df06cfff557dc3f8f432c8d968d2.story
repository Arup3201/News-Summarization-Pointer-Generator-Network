Ukip has surged into the lead in the European election contest despite a bruising week of controversies, a poll revealed today.

Nigel Farage's party recorded 31 per cent support in YouGov research for a Sunday newspaper, three points ahead of Labour, with the Tories languishing in third on 19 per cent.

It is the first time the company has given Ukip an outright advantage in the race, with ballots due to be cast in less than a month.

Research: Nigel Farage's party recorded 31 per cent support in YouGov research for a Sunday newspaper

The results in the survey for the Sunday Times revealed today are in line with a ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday last month.

That put Ukip on 30 per cent, Labour on 28 per cent, and the Conservatives on 21 per cent.

The findings suggest Mr Farage has not sustained significant damage from furores over his expenses, ‘racist’ posters, criticism of misleading campaign literature and dubious comments from activists.

Former Tory donor Paul Sykes, said to be worth £650million, has pledged to plough more money into Ukip after funding one poster campaign.

He told the Sunday Times there would be ‘at least another two waves’ of adverts before the European elections.

‘I'm not giving up,’ he said. ‘That will warn the Conservatives what is going to happen. We will get more democracy in Britain if it skints me.’

The poll, which put the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent and Greens on 8 per cent, came as another Ukip candidate was facing a backlash after suggesting comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’.

William Henwood, who is standing in a 
council election, made the comment in response to a speech by Henry in 
which he said ethnic minorities were under-represented on British 
television.

Separate ComRes 
research for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has highlighted 
disaffection among voters with European institutions.

Some 59 per cent believe the European Parliament does not represent the views of voters, with the number rising to 68 per cent among those aged over 55.

More than half of 18 to 24-year-olds are not planning to cast a ballot next month.

ERS chief executive Katie Ghose said: ‘This year's European elections are receiving an unusual amount of attention.

'We already know that nearly three-quarters of Britons feel their voice doesn't count in the EU and it looks like the problem is getting worse'

‘With Ukip's rising popularity, the TV debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage, and the Conservatives' promise of an in-out referendum, European politics has seldom been so prominent.

‘And yet these results show that people still feel alarmingly distant from European affairs.

‘We already know that nearly 
three-quarters of Britons feel their voice doesn't count in the EU and 
it looks like the problem is getting worse, not better. It's time to tackle the growing disconnect between the British people and European politics.’ 

Controversies: Ukip council candidate William Henwood (left) suggested comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a 'black country', while another, Andre Lampitt (right), was suspended after making racist remarks

Meanwhile, Ukip launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians last night after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light.

On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, took to Twitter to declare: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’

A separate Facebook post in July 2012 allegedly made a joke against Muslims. Mr Bilcliff admitted he could see how his comments could be viewed as homophobic and racist, but said he was neither.

A UKIP spokesman said the matter had been referred to the party’s national executive with a view to disciplinary action.

Last week builder Andre Lampitt, seeking to become a councillor in Merton, south London, and who featured in a UKIP election broadcast, was suspended after making racist remarks on Twitter that the party said were ‘repellent’.
