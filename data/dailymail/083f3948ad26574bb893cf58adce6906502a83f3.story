Mesut Ozil, condemned as a lightweight liability on the left this season, was restored to his central position against Aston Villa and responded with his best performance for some considerable time.

His creativity was most potent in a concentrated burst of little over three minutes – the period when Arsenal scored the goals to win this game – but throughout the match he showed his class in linking play in various areas of the pitch.

Arsenal completed 741 passes against Villa, the most by any Premier League side over the last two seasons, and Ozil was the offensive conductor – completing 54 forward half passes, the most of any Arsenal player, at a success rate of 91.5 per cent.

The touches were neat and the passes mainly simple but usually forward, continuing the flow of moves with minimal fuss. He looked sharp and, as Arsene Wenger made clear, this was a moment to have faith in his biggest signing.

Drop him, was the call of most who have observed Ozil this season. Hand him a starring role, was his manager’s response.

‘I felt he was at the point where you have to show him that confidence is there and he showed as well he can respond when he is under scrutiny,’ explained Wenger. It was a courageous managerial decision which paid off.

As Ozil’s heat map shows he was not prohibited to solely central areas, rather he moved across the line just behind striker Danny Welbeck depending on the ebb and flow of the game. 

He would also drop deeper to receive the ball and start attacks, following the trail of the ball as it moved up the pitch.

Particularly pleasing for Wenger was the way Ozil linked up with Welbeck. The former Manchester United striker fed the German for his goal and the pair also exchanged passes to make it 2-0. Early days for the partnership, but promising signs. ‘That instinctiveness will come,’ said Welbeck.

Wenger admitted the No 10 role is the position Ozil craves. But it meant Alexis Sanchez and Jack Wilshere moved to the bench and Aaron Ramsey operated alongside Mikel Arteta in the holding role.

‘I find you ten more players in my squad who want to play in the middle,’ Wenger added with a smile.

That is the conundrum now for the Frenchman, who must work out a formula that sees all his stars shine.

If he continues to thrust Ozil onto the platform which holds no hiding place it leaves Ramsey needing to operate deeper or out wide – where the Welshman only fitfully performed in the season before his breakthrough last campaign. 

Wilshere wants the job of supplying the striker too, he did well higher up against Manchester City, but it may be he is best dictating from further back and bombing forward.

Sanchez will not stay on the bench on many more occasions so Wenger needs to find a way to incorporate the Chilean to greatest effect. This is all before we consider Santi Cazorla, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott, once he returns from injury, a player who made his desires to play centrally evident during his contract stand-off.

It is a problem most manager’s in the Premier League would give their right leg and probably a few fingers to have, but could still leave Wenger chewing the fingernails.
