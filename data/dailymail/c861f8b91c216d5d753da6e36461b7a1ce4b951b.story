Two Italian aid workers captured by Islamic extremists in Syria this summer are believed to have appeared in a new video begging for their lives.

Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August while distributing aid in Aleppo.

Now video footage has emerged apparently showing the pair wearing niqabs, sitting in a sparse concrete room and holding a piece of paper with the date Wednesday, December 17 written on it.

Video footage has emerged which seems to show Italian women Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, begging to be returned home and warning that their lives are in danger after being captured in Syria

The camera is placed in a fixed position in front of them, but neither look directly into it, and instead seem to be looking down at a script, as Miss Ramelli reads from it.

Speaking in badly-worded English, she says: 'We are Gretta Ramelli and Vanessa Marzullo. We supplicate our government and its mediators to bring us back home before Christmas.

'We are in big danger and could be killed. The government and it mediators are responsible of our lives [sic].'

The message seems to have been recorded three weeks ago, thought it is not clear why it has only come to light now. The Italian foreign ministry has so-far refused to comment.

The 32 second clip appeared on YouTube on Wednesday, and is titled 'Al-Nusra Front detains two Italian employees because of their government's participation in the coalition against it.'

However the video was not posted on any official accounts belonging to Al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate. 

Just after the pair vanished on August 1, Miss Marzullo's father revealed he had begged her not to go to Syria, but she had insisted, saying she wanted to help people

Al Nusra are not linked to terror group Islamic State, who have previously published gruesome videos of hostages being executed, including Britons Daivd Haines and Alan Henning 

In previous hostage videos by the group, detainees have been shown in front of Al-Nusra's flag.

According to reports at the time of the girls' disappearance, they were captured on August 1 along with an Italian journalist who managed to escape.

The pair were initially taken to the town of El Ismo, west of Aleppo where they were transported to the home of the head of the local Revolutionary Council. 

As the news spread, Miss Marzullo's father, Salvatore, revealed he had begged his daughter not to travel to Syria, but she had insisted on going.

He said: 'What could I do? Vanessa is an adult, a golden girl, brave and responsible. I tried to reason with her, I tried to convince her in every way I could not to do what she had in mind.

'But when you realize that all your talk, your thoughts, and eventually all your prayers are not heard, what can you do?

'I could not stop her from doing what she wanted. It's not like you can take a person and tie them down. Tell me what I had to do. Was I wrong? I had to tie her down?'

The girls travelled to the large Syrian city of Aleppo this summer, and continued posting images of bombed out cities and protest marches on their Facebook pages until mid-July

Jabhat al-Nusra are a terrorist group based in Syria who are primarily engaged in fighting the regime of Bashar Al Assad and other Syrian groups, with the aim of establishing a fundamentalist Islamic regime.

It is not known precisely how many hostages Al Nusra hold, though they are one of the most well armed, well equipped, and well established terror groups in Syria.

As an affiliate of Al Qaeda, Al Nusra have no association with ISIS, who have become infamous for publishing gruesome videos of hostages being executed.

British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning were killed by ISIS after being taken hostage, as well as American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and US aid worker Peter  Kassig.
