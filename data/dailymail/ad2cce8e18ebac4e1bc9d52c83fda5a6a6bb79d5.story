Felton turned himself in to police at 12.50am today

New York Knicks star Raymond Felton has been arrested after allegedly pointing a gun at his wife who has filed for divorce. 

Felton turned himself in to police at 12.50am today shortly after the Knicks lost to the Dallas Mavericks at home in Madison Square Gardens.

It is believed his wife Ariane Raymondo-Felton, 26, took the gun to a police station before the sports star handed himself him. 

Felton was expected to be arraigned on charges of criminal possession of a weapon in the second, third and fourth degrees.

Police said the charges do not stem from Felton using the firearm in a menacing manner but from possessing an unregistered gun.

However, according to sources he allegedly pointed a gun at his estranged wife, 26, during an earlier dispute. 

A law enforcement source told The New York Post: 'The wife is saying they had four verbal altercations since July last year.

'On the last one, he pointed a gun at her. It's an armor-piercing gun, loaded. It’s a bad ass gun.'

Felton could face jail time if convicted under new gun laws.

According to sources the 28mm handgun is one of the largest ever made.

A Knicks spokesman said the team had no immediate comment.

Felton’s wife, a law student at Fordham University, filed for divorce after 19 months of marriage.

The Knicks brought Felton for a second stint in New York in July 2012, opting to let Jeremy Lin leave.

Felton helped the Knicks win the Atlantic Division last year.
