Xherdan Shaqiri and his brother Erdin will be in Munich on Wednesday to hold crunch talks with Bayern Munich about a move to either Inter Milan or Liverpool.

The forward is well liked by Brendan Rodgers but the Reds are reluctant to spend now and would prefer to look at a deal in the summer instead.

Inter have offered £2million for a loan deal, similar to the one proposed to Arsenal for Lukas Podolski, but Bayern want to sell outright and would like Liverpool to come to the table.

Erdin, Xherdan's agent, wants to see if Bayern will accept a loan deal to Inter now with the prospect of joining Liverpool in the summer.

Bayern are still on their winter break but the player's immediate future should come to a conclusion after Wednesday's meeting. 

Everton have drawn up a list of goalkeeping targets which includes Cardiff City's David Marshall and Alex McCarthy of Queens Park Rangers.

Manager Roberto Martinez wants a keeper who can play at first-team level straight away as Tim Howard is out for the month - and possibly longer - with a torn calf.

Current deputy Joel Robles has interest from Spain and could return but there is also interest in Howard from the MLS, who see the US goalkeeper as not only a good player but a very marketable one following his World Cup exploits.

Queens Park Rangers stopper Alex McCarthy (centre) is also among the targets for Everton

Cardiff rejected big offers for Marshall last year with Arsenal among his suitors but he has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in England's top-two divisions over recent seasons.

Norwich City's John Ruddy, Ali Al Habsi of Wigan Athletic, Sergio Romero of Sampdoria and Erwin Mulder of Feyenoord have also been mentioned.

Ujpest goalkeeper and Serbia Under 21 international Marko Dmitrovic, 22, has also been invited to come in on trial.

The agents of Liverpool midfielder Suso were in Milan on Monday to broker his end-of-season transfer.

Spaniard Suso was playing for Liverpool's Under 21 side in their 2-0 victory against Shrewsbury on Monday.

Suso, who has not played for the Liverpool first team since their Capital One Cup penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough at Anfield on September 23, impressed during a 45-minute run-out as he eased his way back following a groin injury.

However, his appearances in a Reds shirt will be less frequent after his representatives agreed a four-year contract with AC Milan, to kick in from July. The 21-year-old is out of contract at Anfield in the summer so he is free to talk to European clubs, although initial approaches from Milan were made last August.

What remains is whether Liverpool wish to negotiate letting him go now for a small fee.

Milan are also discussing whether to allow Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel to return to Stamford Bridge and go out on another loan elsewhere.

Real Sociedad manager David Moyes will continue to take stock of possible loans from England this month but has ruled out moves for Everton's Arouna Kone and Mohamed Salah of Chelsea.

Moyes, whose side beat Barcelona 1-0 on Sunday, has lost only one game since moving to Spain and is keen to build on the feelgood factor surrounding Sunday's victory.

His staff are working on targets in Spain but he is also keen to add some experience if he can find it in January - with Arsenal's Joel Campbell one potential target from the Premier League.

'I’d like to add one or two to the squad, but on loan if it can be done,' said Moyes. 'I’ve got one or two in mind and maybe some from back home who would like the opportunity to come and play in Spain. If there’s one market I know best at the moment then it’s the British market.'

Newcastle United have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to sign M'Baye Niang from AC Milan.

The former Caen forward has been courted by Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and West Ham United over recent seasons but has a poor reputation off the pitch which has often influenced clubs to not see a move through.

The 20-year-old would like to join a Premier League side with Milan willing to let him leave - and wanting to add an option-to-buy clause to the deal - but Niang is also waiting to see if any other offers come in.

Sheffield United have made a surprise enquiry for Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven. The 24-year-old Scotland international, formerly of Liverpool and Fulham, has five months left on his contract and has attracted scouts from Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion in recent weeks.

Dundee United chairman Stephen Thompson said: 'We did turn down a verbal offer last week. It's a very difficult one, we'd like Gary to stay. We've made him an offer to stay but there's only so much you can do.

'It's a very difficult one with Gary because he's only got about 20-21 weeks left on his contract but what difference will he make on the park in those weeks? We'll see how it goes and hopefully he's still playing here for a while yet.'

Sheffield United and Wolverhampton Wanderers are among clubs also looking at West Ham striker Sean Maguire.

West Ham United are continuing to assess possible additions to their squad.

Sturm Graz midfielder Anel Hadzic has again been offered to manager Sam Allardyce. The 25-year-old Bosnia international can play at centre back and could also provide cover for Alex Song after his call-up from Cameroon.

Bordeaux defender Ludovic Sane, a long-time target, has also been discussed again as, despite signing Doneil Henry, Allardyce wants experience for his defence in the second half of the season.

Queens Park Rangers have failed to tempt Yann M'Vila away from Inter Milan. The France international is surplus to requirements under Roberto Mancini and is keen to move.

Adel Taarabt was mentioned in discussions over a possible deal for M'Vila but the 24-year-old was not interested.

M'Vila is on loan from Rubin Kazan but Inter have an option to purchase which they won't be taking up. Mancini is waiting to see if another former QPR target, Lassana Diarra, gains FIFA approval for cancelling his contract with Lokomotiv Moscow.

Southampton have already asked about details for Bruno Martins Indi at Porto and have now made enquiries for his teammate highly-rated prospect Juan Quintero.

Ronald Koeman is looking to take the Colombian on loan as injuries mount up at St Mary's.

Sunderland were not alone in watching Virgil van Dijk of Celtic against Kilmarnock on Monday night.

Tony Pulis had also sent scouts to watch the Holland Under 21 international as West Brom continue to assess some of the talent in the Scottish Premiership.

Pulis wants another defender and has been linked with Robert Huth and Marc Wilson of former club Stoke City. Van Dijk would cost around £8m though which would be a big chunk of Albion's budget.

Celtic are preparing to set off for a week-long training camp in Gran Canaria and first-team coach John Kennedy said: 'Until something is firm and concrete it is just rumours. Virgil is a massive player for us, we don’t want to lose him.'

Wigan Athletic are in discussions to sign former West Bromwich Albion defender Liam Ridgewell.

They would like to bring Ridgewell on loan from Portland Timbers.

Bolton Wanderers, fresh from signing top young-prospect Zach Clough to a new two-year contract extension, are handing a trial to Serbian international Marko Milinkovic this week.

The 26-year-old midfielder plays for Slovakian side Slovan Bratislava and could join on a free transfer.

Neil Lennon is also discussing possible loans from Arsenal and Chelsea.

Bordeaux president Jean Louis Tiraud wants an answer from Arsenal in the next 24 hours about the future of Yaya Sanogo.

Arsene Wenger wants Sanogo to go on loan to a Premier League club and Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Swansea, Stoke and Everton have shown an interest but Bordeaux have made the biggest play.

Tiraud said: 'Sanogo wants to come on loan to Bordeaux, and he has told his manager Arsene Wenger that. We are working on bringing Sanogo to Bordeaux. We are going all in on this target. We have asked Arsenal to give us an answer on Tuesday or Wednesday latest.'
