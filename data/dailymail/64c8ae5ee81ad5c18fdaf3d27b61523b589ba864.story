Police are looking into the Unite union’s campaign of alleged intimidation in the Grangemouth dispute.

Scotland’s Chief Constable, Sir Stephen House, stepped in following complaints about the so-called leverage strategy used by Labour’s biggest donor during the dispute with the petrochemical firm Ineos last month.

During the stand-off, the Mail revealed how Unite boss Len McCluskey deployed a dirty-tricks squad to target and humiliate the firm’s executives and their families.

Rat run: Unite protest on the route of Ineos boss Jim Ratcliffe's local half marathon

One director said he feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite protesters descended on his drive in Dunfermline with a giant inflatable rat in the school holidays.

Police were called after the group told his neighbours he was ‘evil’. No one was charged.

The militants’ behaviour is being examined after Tory MP Priti Patel wrote to Sir Stephen, urging police to probe whether Unite’s actions breached the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.

This makes it an offence for a trade unionist to ‘use violence’ or ‘intimidate’, or watch someone’s home or workplace.

Miss Patel also suggested that Unite may have breached the Public Order Act 1986, which outlaws ‘any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress’.

The daughter of a second Ineos company boss had ‘Wanted’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away in Hampshire. Miss Patel has also asked Hampshire police to investigate.

In a letter to Miss Patel, a spokesman for Sir Stephen said: ‘I can advise that the Chief Constable is looking into the matter and will provide a response in due course.’  

The Grangemouth dispute has proved embarrassing for Labour.

Unite members went on strike to back Stevie Deans, the union’s convenor at the plant.

Mr Deans, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, where he became embroiled in a vote-fixing scandal, was suspended by Ineos over claims he used company time for political campaigning.

The Conservative Party accused the Labour leadership of failing to get to grips with Unite’s activities. Yesterday it also emerged that the Labour councillor who blew the whistle on the claims of vote-rigging in Falkirk has been snubbed by the party.

Intervened: Stephen House, Chief Constable of the Police Service of Scotland, stepped in following complaints about the strategy of Labour's biggest donor

Former Falkirk Council leader Linda Gow, who alerted the party to allegations against Unite, said she was ‘disappointed’ not to be on the final shortlist for the election of Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Falkirk on December 8.

Last night, Miss Patel said: ‘Ed Miliband is running scared of Len McCluskey’s bruisers.

‘Instead of hiding away in internal meetings, Ed Miliband should justify why he continues to take money from a union that is under police investigation.

‘If he’s too weak to stand up to the union bully-boys, he’s too  weak to stand up for hard-working people.’

A Unite spokesman said: ‘As a former apologist for the Bahrainian police state, it comes as no surprise that Priti Patel prefers wasting police time to score cheap political points and undermine the right to peaceful protest than representing her constituents.’
