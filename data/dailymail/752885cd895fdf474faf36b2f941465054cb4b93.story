Nowhere outside of Anfield has a fonder place in the hearts of Liverpool fans than Istanbul and its Ataturk Olympic Stadium.

It was here, of course, that Rafael Benitez and his players completed arguably the greatest Champions League triumph of them all, coming back from three goals down at half-time against AC Milan to be crowned European champions for a fifth time in 2005.

The legend of that night lives on; Benitez’s inspirational reshuffle at the interval, sending on Didi Hamann to help turn the game, Steven Gerrard dragging his beleaguered team up off the floor, and Jerzy Dudek’s penalty save from Andriy Shevchenko in the shootout that crowned an epic comeback.

Nearly a decade later, at the premiere of the movie One Night in Istanbul last September, Gerrard could still hardly believe what happened. ‘It goes to show how big the night was, there’s still a buzz about it today,’ said the Liverpool skipper. ‘Every day I have conversations about it, in and around the city I still get asked about it and get thanked for my individual performance.

‘It will be in my memories until the day I go, that’s because I love Liverpool just as much as the fans. The feeling when Jerzy saved the last pen, I still get goosebumps now. It was a surreal feeling.’

Gerrard is the only current Liverpool player left from that night. Sadly, he will be absent when they return to the Ataturk on Thursday night to face Besiktas, a hamstring problem meaning that he has been left at home on Merseyside to try and get fit for Sunday’s clash with Manchester City.

The occasion is bound to stir the emotions of Liverpool fans, even those who weren’t lucky enough to be there in 2005, and manager Brendan Rodgers was quick to acknowledge the significance of the venue when Liverpool touched down here on Wednesday.

‘Of course it was a great historic night for the club and everyone associated with Liverpool respects that,’ he said. ‘It was a little while ago and there won’t be too many of our players that were involved at that time, but it’s a real iconic stadium for the club and a big part of that history.’

Rodgers knows that this will be an altogether different occasion, however. For starters, the prize at stake is a somewhat more modest – a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, Liverpool having won the first leg 1-0 at Anfield last week.

They arrived in Istanbul without eight senior players including Gerrard, some injured and some rested as Rodgers tries to balance his options in the knowledge that Liverpool will not land back home until 3am on Friday morning with little recovery time before they face the champions.

‘We will have very little preparation time,’ he added. ‘But look, it’s the way it’s been dealt and we’ll deal with it the best we can. The players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep doing the best we can. But it’s still a European competition, and I would rather be in it than not in it.’

Even without so many regulars, Rodgers should still be able to field a strong enough side and has already confirmed that Daniel Sturridge will start in attack. The main area of concern is central midfield, with Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Lucas all absent through injury, but Emre Can could be moved further forward after impressing in a three-man defence since Christmas.

Liverpool’s 8-0 victory over Besiktas at Anfield in November 2007 remains the Turkish club’s heaviest European defeat, and the biggest in the Champions League beyond the qualifying stages, but more recent history suggests that this will be no easy task for Rodgers’s team who have failed to win any of their last four away games in Europe.

Besiktas, who are playing at the Ataturk while their Vodafone Arena is being renovated, beat Tottenham 1-0 here in the Europa League group stage in December having already held Arsenal to a goalless draw in Champions League qualifying last August.

‘We respect our opponent,’ said Rodgers. ‘We haven’t arrived in Turkey being arrogant enough to think it will be comfortable. We understand it will be a difficult game, but we still have a squad strong enough to hopefully get the job complete.’

And we know better than to doubt Liverpool at the Ataturk.
