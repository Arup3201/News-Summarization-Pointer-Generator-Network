Two thirds of British families say they sit down together for a family meal almost every day, yet for many there are uninvited guests at the table.

On average 11.4 million tech devices such as smartphones and tablets to laptops and iPods are brought to family meals.

Almost a quarter of families (22 per cent) who bring tech to the table feel they are prevented from having proper conversations with each other at meal times, seriously impacting on what should be quality time together.

Almost half of mothers have resorted to forcibly removing technology from dinner by either banning or hiding it

Children and young teenagers are the worst offenders, with a third (34 per cent) of 5-to-15-year-olds regularly bringing some form of tech device to family meals.

According to the new research of 2,000 parents, technology is also limiting the amount of time families spend together during meal times. 

For one in five (19 per cent) families dinner has become a functional and rushed occasion frequented by regular arguments.

Once at the dinner table, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter (56 per cent); and messaging apps and emails (48 per cent) are the biggest distractions. 

The result is that conversation with nearest and dearest is killed, in favour of digital communication with friends further afield.

In an attempt to combat the barrier technology creates around meal times, 16 per cent of mothers admit to actually texting or messaging their kids to get them to the dinner table. 

Almost half (43 per cent) of mothers are also so fed up that they have resorted to forcibly removing technology from the dinner table by either banning it, or completely hiding it.

Three quarters of mothers (76 per cent) believe that spending meal times together is important for family bonding, but find that getting their family to the dinner table challenging (37 per cent).

The effort that goes into preparing dinner, combined with a perceived lack of appetite and interest from the family, leaves two thirds of UK mothers feeling both frustrated and upset (69 per cent).

Parenting expert Liz Fraser said: 'Technology has been in family homes for decades; but mobile tech means it comes with us everywhere we go - and, sadly, that often includes mealtimes. 

'Previously nobody would have brought a television to the dinner table, or eaten their breakfast while on the phone in the hallway. 

'Meal times are absolutely vital for family bonding, developing social skills, and sharing stories from the day. Making them a little bit different and fun are great ways to keep everyone's focus in the room and rediscover the pleasure in just spending time with each other.'

A spokesperson for Mexican food brand Old El Paso, who commissioned the research, said: 'The problem of technology at the dinner table appears to be an increasing problem as our lives become more mobile. 

'However, meal times are an important part of family life and should be a fun opportunity for everyone to get stuck in together.'
