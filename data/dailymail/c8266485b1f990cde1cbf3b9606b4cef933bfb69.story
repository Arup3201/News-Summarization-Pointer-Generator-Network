There was chaos at Miami International Airport on Thursday afternoon after one of it's busiest concourses had to be evacuated as authorities investigated a suspicious package.

Airport spokesman Marc Henderson said the package was discovered Thursday at about 3:05 p.m. outside the gate of a Caribbean Air flight.

All passengers in the airport's J concourse were evacuated to a nearby area, although the concourse was reopened several hours later.

Henderson said authorities investigated the package and determined it was not a threat.

Ten flights were unable to depart and two incoming flights were diverted to other gates.
