Yang Zhiqiao, 75, dressed in the Mickey Mouse costume, earning money in the local park

The 75-year-old mother of a Chinese man has taken to dressing up as Mickey Mouse in order to raise money to help him find a girlfriend.

Single man Yang Guan, 40, thought his mother was joking when she said she would use a second hand Disney costume to pose with tourists in the local park in Luoyang, Henan province, central China, so she could raise some extra cash to help him get his life on track.

His mother Yang Zhiqiao said she had been feeling bad for her son because he couldn't get a girlfriend, and raising money was a way to help him support a potential wife.

Local children have started calling Zhiqiao the 'Mickey Mouse Grandma', and she has taken to charging a 10 yuan fee to have a picture taken with her in popular tourist venues.

However, many people have been paying her a lot more when they find out that she is a frail old lady struggling in a heavy costume.

Locals have even been volunteering in order to help her take frequent breaks, taking turns to wear the secon-hand costume.

Zhiqiao said: 'I have to make more money to find my son a wife.'

Zhiqiao's son bought the costume originally, planning to use it to make some money, but now it is his mother that uses it, as his day job prevented him from doing so.

Zhiqiao said: 'I really felt sorry for my son because he is now 40 and he still hasn't 
managed to get a girlfriend.

'He is a very good man and hard-working but 
he struggles to get a good job to earn enough money to be able to 
support a wife, and so he has had difficulty getting a partner.

'I wanted
 to help him but at my age it's hard to find a job where I can earn 
money.

Single Chinese man Yang Guan, 40, thought his 75-year-old mum (pictured) was taking the Mickey when she said she intended to get a job to help him to find a girlfriend.
But he realised Yang Zhiqiao, 75, was serious when she turned up with a second-hand Mickey Mouse costume

'Then I saw some pictures of people who had gone to Disneyland and
 been photographed with some of the characters, and I thought to myself 
that not everybody would be able to afford to go to Disneyland to be 
seen with Mickey Mouse.

'So I decided to bring Mickey Mouse to them.

'I moved here with my husband and my son in 1987, and the future
 seemed bright, but it didn't work out after my husband and I divorced 
in 1996 and we haven't been able to get on our feet financially ever 
since.

'My son is quite depressed that he is getting on now and has still
 not managed to find a partner. That was why I decided to help him.'

Yang Zhiqiao has to take frequent breaks (right) from the costume, saying that extended periods dressed in it can cause her to have trouble breathing. Nevertheless, she continues to work for her son's benefit, despite the fact the purchase of the costume, and business plan, was his to begin with

But while the costume might have positive effects on Guan, it has had negative effects on his mother.

She said: 'The costume is too heavy, there is little air inside.

'If I wear it for a long time I cannot breathe.'

Park visitor Fen Ts'ui, 37, said: 'It really hurts to see her dressed 
like that. She is so old and should live a much easier life now.'
