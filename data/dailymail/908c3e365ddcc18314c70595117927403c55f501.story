A 20-year-old aspiring model from Georgia has been killed in a suspected road rage accident that also took the life of the driver who rammed his pickup truck into her SUV.

Chelsea Gerrish, of Gainsville, died at the scene last Friday when police say 48-year-old Michael Williams crashed his pickup truck head on into her vehicle on Browns Bridge Road.

Mr Williams, a married father of three from Flowery Branch, was also pronounced dead on the spot.

More victims: Two female passengers who were riding in the 20-year-old's car were hospitalized with serious injuries

The tragic incident took place just after midnight Friday when Williams reportedly attempted to pass another vehicle on the two-lane road in Gainesville, The Gainseville Times reported.

A couple riding in a Toyota Highlander called 911 to report that the driver of a red 1996 Chevrolet C2500 pickup repeatedly hit their vehicle from behind.

'He's been following us and he keeps turning off his lights on and off,' a frantic woman said on the call obtained by CBS Atlanta. 'He just hit us! He just hit us!'

According to police Cpl. Joe Britte, Williams attempted to go around the Highlander and slid into oncoming traffic doing about 70mph.

That is when police say he struck Gerrish's Jeep Cherokee head-on. Investigators say the young woman played no part in the road rage confrontation between Williams and the occupants of the Highlander.

Officers who arrived on the scene of the collision in the 3000 block of Browns Bridge Road discovered the bodies of Gerrish and Williams in the wreckage.

Two female passengers who were riding in the 20-year-old's car were taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center with serious but not life-threatening injuries.

Police say Mr Williams was alone in his vehicle at the time of the collision.

An autopsy will be performed on Williams to determine if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident. Police say no controlled substances were found inside his mangled truck.  

According to her obituary, Gerrish lived in Gainesville with her toddler son, Aiden, and worked for the moving truck rental company U-Haul.

A 2011 graduate of North Forsyth High 
School, the blonde, blue-eyed beauty had spent the past year building her
modelling portfolio.

Williams,
a graduate of Georgia Southern University and a devout Catholic, leaves
behind his wife of 20 years, Kimberly, and their three children.

Family torn apart: Williams' son wrote in his eulogy that his dad was the finest parent, husband and coach anyone could ask for

The 48-year-old husband and father worked for McKee Foods for over 20 years and coached baseball in his spare time as part of the organization Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Chattanooga.

Williams' son Bucke posted a heart-rending eulogy on his Facebook page last week, describing his deceased dad as 'the best father,' coach and husband.
