A daredevil great-grandmother has celebrated her 100th birthday by riding a Segway around an obstacle course in front of her family.

Sylvia Frankton, of Holbeach, Lincolnshire, who was clocked speeding three years ago by police - hopped aboard the two-wheeled machine to commemorate the milestone.

The great-grandmother-of-17 had her entire family gathered, including all her great-grandchildren and her five grandchildren, and her relatives had hired a Segway for the younger attendees to use.

'Amazing' experience: Sylvia Frankton, a 100-year-old great grandmother who was clocked speeding in her car three years ago, has celebrated her centenary by taking to a Segway

But Ms Frankton insisted she took a turn. She is no stranger to speed, having been caught driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone in 2011, but spared punishment after writing a letter of apology to police.

Originally from Hartley, Kent, Ms Frankton moved to her £225,000 detached home in Holbeach 17 years ago to be closer to her daughter. She said: ‘I had never even seen a Segway before.

‘But I just wanted a go as soon as I set eyes on it - it was amazing. My legs struggle to walk these days, so just having to lean with the handles was so easy - I wish I could get one of my own.

‘I didn't realise I could have had another go afterwards, I wouldn't have got off if I had known that At first I tried to drive it like a car, but once I got the hang of it I loved the speed.

‘I still love driving my own car you know, I love that freedom - and you can't beat a bit of speed, can you? My whole weekend was marvellous, I have no idea how my children managed it.’

Daughter Janet Dougill, 71, said: ‘We hired a company to organise an event that would keep all ages entertained.

‘I couldn't believe it when I saw mum - not because she was having a go on the Segway but because no-one was holding on to her. Everyone was shocked when they saw her.

‘I don't think she can quite believe it yet. Mum's birthday was on Tuesday but we were so pleased we had the party on Sunday because the weather was lovely and everyone could get outside.

‘Watching her enjoy herself on the Segway was amazing but she wasn't going too fast this time.

‘She was stopped by police for speeding three years ago but she wrote a letter to Lincolnshire police and said sorry and wasn't charged. We are really proud of her.’
