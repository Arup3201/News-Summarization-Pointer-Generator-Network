Chat show host Matthew Wright refused to apologise today after hosting a TV debate entitled 'Foxy Knoxy: Would Ya?'.

The former journalist sparked criticism 
on Twitter after discussing with panellists how Amanda Knox was 
'undeniably fit and loves wild sex'.

In a preview blurb for this morning's 
episode of The Wright Stuff, the Channel 5 website said: 'So if you were
a guy who'd met her in a bar and she invited you back to hers, would 
you go?

Crass and insensitive: Viewers of The Wright Stuff were stunned when presenter Matthew Wright asked them to vote on whether they would 'take home' Amanda Knox in light of her acquittal for murder

The discussion was conducted between Matthew Wright and a panel of Kelly Hoppen, Christopher Biggins and Liz McClaron

'I'm being quite serious. Or would something in your brain make 
you think twice?'

Wright began the segment by pointing out that Amanda Knox had been cleared of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, before insisting that she is 'foxy as hell'.

But he defended his actions after the discussion was branded crass and abysmal by bloggers.

He said: 'I thought it would be interesting to 
find out if mud sticks, or whether an innocent young woman could now go 
out and behave in a perfectly normal way.'

But viewers
of the show, aired at 9.15am just 
12 hours after the 24-year-old American was freed, slammed the 
discussion and bombarded the Channel's official message board with 
complaints.

Michele Morrison, of Glasgow, wrote: 'So distasteful!!!!!so many other ways this story could be discussed

'The whole world is engrossed on this
story.

'I feel sorry for the families or friends listening to rubbish 
such as your program. Shameful!!!'

Knox was sensationally freed after being cleared of the murder of British citizen Meredith Kercher. She was described as 'undeniably fit' by Matthew Wright

A writer name only as Jon added: 'On the subject of the Amanda Knox topic - what the hell is wrong with you?'

While Helen, from Kent, said: 'I 
can't believe it. You have managed to make Jeremy Kyle's show look 
tasteful. None of us know the full story and what exactly went on.

Vivienne Pattison of Media-watch UK said the discussion was unbelievable and totally inappropriate.

She said: 'To think that someone thought this would be an acceptable format for a show is beyond belief.

'It's entirely insensitive and should not be aired at any time, let alone as part of a morning chat show.

Show business website TMZ posted a similar question asking readers who they would rather take home, Amanda Knox or Casey Anthony who was acquitted of the murder of her daughter earlier this year

'It seems totally sick and is as 
bizarre as it is cruel. It's cruel for all concerned and is an example 
where the boundaries of 'banter' and entertainment become blurred.

'Of all the takes on this huge and sensitive case this has to be the worst.
'I should hope there would be some serious questions asked by producers on this.'

Another, Yusuf Afghan tweeted: 'The Wright Stuff. Another show that clearly shows Channel 5's (complete lack of) relevance.'

Laura Buchan wrote: 'So disrespectful - who at C5 had this bright idea????'

Andrew Livingston, a media rights expert, tweeted: 'The Wright Stuff goes with possibly the most crass topic in history.'

Square one: Meredith Kercher's mother Arline, left,Â  told a press conference today they were 'back to square 
one' knowing that someone involved in her daughter's, right, death was still roaming free

But a Wright Stuff spokeswoman defended the show saying the topic was handled sensitively.

She said: 'The 
discussion conducted between Matthew Wright and our panel of Kelly 
Hoppen, Christopher Biggins and Liz McClarnon was handled extremely 
sensitively and at no point did we lose sight of the fact that at the 
heart of the matter is the tragic death of a young girl - Meredith 
Kercher.'

Show business website TMZ also posted a similar question on their website with the heading 'Amanda Knox Vs Casey Anthony, who would you rather?' with readers voting in a pole

Casey Anthony was acquitted of the murder of her daughter earlier this year.

Meredith's distraught family held a 
press conference today and told the world they were 'back to square 
one', knowing full well some involved in their daughter's death was 
still roaming free.
