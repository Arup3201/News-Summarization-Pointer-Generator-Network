It is no secret that rabbits like to hop.

But these specially trained 'show-jumping' bunnies are leaping to a whole new level by vaulting hurdles and fences like horses.

The hobby has taken a leap in popularity in Britain and competitions are regularly being held across the country.

Kayleigh Hopkinson, 26, has been training her rabbits, Miffy and Honey, for two years.

Jump: The sport was invented in Sweden in the 1980s and has seen a leap in popularity

She said: 'I love watching my rabbits make it over the jumps because they enjoy it so much. It's so cute to watch and they can be pretty entertaining.

'We originally got into it for exercise reasons, I wanted them to be healthy so set up jumps around my garden. Now they just run as fast as they can back and forth over the jumps.

'I first got rabbits about four years ago, but it was only when I went to a show that I discovered rabbit jumping and thought "Why not give it a go?"

One giant leap: The mats have to be made out of rubber because if the course was made of grass the rabbits would be more interested in eating it than jumping

The rabbits are marked for the speed and height at which they jump the course

'When it comes to competitions I want them to enjoy themselves. I don't push them into training, they choose to do it, it's not about winning for me as long as they're happy.

'Miffy's a bit more enthusiastic than Honey though, she prefers to do the limbo. She would rather go underneath the jumps than over them, but that's just as fun.'

The sport was invented in Sweden in the 1980s but has steadily grown in popularity across the globe. The rabbits are marked for the speed and height at which they jump the course.

They compete along a rubber mat but not grass - because 'they are more interested in eating it' than jumping.

Costly: Rabbits can cost up to £1,000 a year to 'maintain'

The sport is taken as a bit of fun - but rabbit lover Emma Lassey, 17, who has been training her bunnies for several years, urged the public not to buy the animals specifically for jumping.

She said: 'It takes time, patience and an energetic, eager rabbit to take part in rabbit jumping.

'Rabbits are a massive responsibility and can cost up to £1,000 a year each - even without including their accommodation costs - and rabbits should have company so the cost is even more; they are not creatures that should be bought on a whim.

'If anyone is serious about getting a pair of rabbits then rabbit rescues are the best place to go with thousands, young and old, looking for new homes.'

The A-level student of Brighouse, West Yorkshire, who has rabbits Hector and Theo, added: 'You do not need proper hurdles to get started. Plant pots and garden canes work well - but whatever is used, the bars must fall from both sides when touched to prevent the rabbit from hurting itself.

'Rabbit jumping is about your rabbits getting exercise and enjoying themselves so always make it a positive experience for them. When they don't want to jump anymore, don't force them.'
