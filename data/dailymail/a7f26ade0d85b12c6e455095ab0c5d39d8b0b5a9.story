Difficult decision: After being told there was a chance the cancer would return Emma Neville underwent a double mastectomy

A 23-year-old decided to have a double mastectomy, after doctors told her there was a chance her breast cancer could return.

Emma Neville's difficult decision began when she discovered a lump in her breast last August.

But doctors reassured her it was unlikely to be anything to worry about.

Due to her young age and with no history of breast cancer in her family, medics suggested it could be linked to her hormone cycle rather than anything as sinister as breast cancer.

But when the lump was still there eight weeks later, she returned to her GP for further investigations.

She asked to be referred to the Nightingale Centre - Europe’s first purpose-built breast cancer prevention and research facility - to undergo more tests.

Ms Neville's worst fears were realised when a scan revealed she had cancer - making her one of the youngest women in Greater Manchester to be diagnosed with the disease.

Doctors advised she needed surgery and intensive chemotherapy to save her life.

Ms Neville, now 24, said: 'It took a few weeks for me to be diagnosed, I think because the doctors thought I was just too young to have breast cancer.

'I was really shocked when I was told. I don’t remember much about that day but I know it didn’t seem real to me at all. The whole experience was traumatic.'

At the same time Ms Neville, from Wythenshawe, also decided to undergo egg harvesting because there was a risk that the treatment would leave her unable to have children naturally.

Decision: Ms Neville asked to be referred to the Nightingale Centre, right, Europe’s first purpose-built breast cancer prevention and research facility to undergo more tests after she found a lump in her breast

Graph: Female breast cancer is strongly related to age, with the highest rates overall being in older women so Ms Neville's case is very rare - this graph shows in 2007/2008 only 28 women aged 20 to 24 were diagnosed with breast cancer

Surgeons initially believed she had responded well to the chemotherapy, but she was dealt a fresh blow when further checks showed that traces of the disease remained.

The next step was to undergo radiotherapy.

But doctors told her there was still a 38 per cent chance of the disease returning, leading to Emma’s brave decision three months ago to undergo a double mastectomy.

She first talked through the procedure with counsellors at the Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention charity, and later also underwent reconstructive surgery.

Cancer is less common in adolescents and young adults than in older people, and for this reason it can often be misdiagnosed or overlooked. 

Lester Barr, breast cancer surgeon and chairman of Genesis, says less than one in 1,000 women under 30 will get breast cancer.

He adds: 'It’s very rare that Emma has developed breast cancer at such a young age - 23-years-old is particularly young.

'It is thought that at least half of the young women in this age group who develop breast cancer do so because they have a strong genetic predisposition to the disease, such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.'

One person in every 200 carries one of these faulty genes, which cause an 80 to 90 per cent risk of developing breast cancer in a lifetime.

This compares to the ‘normal risk’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer.

The procedures have given her the best protection against the cancer coming back, and doctors now believe she has an excellent prognosis.

But there is no denying the circumstances Ms Neville faced were rare.

This compares to the ‘normal risk’ which sees one woman in every nine to 10 develop breast cancer.

Ms Neville’s case was different because she could find no evidence of breast cancer when she looked through her family tree.

'We looked back at my family history and could find no history of the disease which makes it more unusual,' she says.

'It was out of the blue.'

It is boosting research into the condition which is now driving Emma forward as she organises a charity ball in aid of Genesis.

The former pupil of St James’ High School in Cheadle is organising The Black and Pink Party at Bowdon Rugby Club, which will take place on October 27.

She hopes it will become an annual event, and is also taking part in the Race for Life through Tatton Park next month.

Ms Neville, who has just returned to work in customer service for a clothing company, says: 'I want to give something back to Genesis.'

Although rare, other young woman in the UK have undergone a double mastectomy in the battle against cancer.

In 2009, aged 18, Hannah Fitzpatrick became the youngest woman in Britain to have a double mastectomy in a preventative operation to beat the scourge of breast cancer which has haunted her family.

It followed the diagnosis of two of her cousins with breast cancer, both in their early twenties  -  an unusually young age. Both were subsequently found to have the same faulty gene.
