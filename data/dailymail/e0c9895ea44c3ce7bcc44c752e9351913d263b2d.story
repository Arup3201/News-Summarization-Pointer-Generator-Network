She spends most of her time dressed down in sportswear in her role as a tennis coach but her son's victory at Wimbledon has given Judy Murray the opportunity to unveil her inner glamour goddess.

The 53-year-old wore a green leaf print dress to Downing Street today as she joined Andy at a celebratory reception with Prime Minister, David Cameron, to mark his historic grand slam win.

She showed off her slender legs with the short hemline and further elongated her figure by wearing black high heels.

Congratulations: Prime Minister David Cameron invited Andy Murray and his family to No 10 to mark his historic win

Perhaps Mrs Murray was dressed to impress the PM with her skimpy outfit as when asked how the PM was after she left No 10, she replied: 'gorgeous.'

The night before, Mrs Murray fitted this description herself as she attended the Winner's Ball in a £1680 floor-length glittering gown by British designer Jenny Packham.

She told the BBC after her son's victory that she didn't normally wear dresses but she would make an exception in the light of his success.

She said: 'I've just been selecting my dress for the champions' ball and I've never worn a long dress in my life before. But I will be tonight, with great pride.'

The mother-of-two hasn't stopped beaming
since her son defeated world number one Novak Djokovic yesterday - 
achieving his childhood dream and becoming the first Brit to lift the 
trophy in 77 years.

Support: A more casually dressed Judy had been on the edge of her seat during the tense final

Emotional: She was in tears as her son clinched victory

Delight: But she hasn't stopped smiling since as here she is congratulated by Ronnie Wood

Once a professional player herself, she yesterday wept as Murray snatched victory from the Serbian.

The proud mother said she was an 'emotional wreck' following his win but added: 'I feel very proud of him.'

'This is the thing he has talked about winning since he was a little boy playing tennis and of course it was a dream that has suddenly become a reality for him,' she added.

It's not the first time Mrs Murray has seen one of her off spring crowned champion at Wimbledon. In 2007 her other son, Jamie, won the mixed doubles.

She said the results were testament to both her son's hard work.

'We've got a Wimbledon singles champion and a Wimbledon mixed doubles champion from a little club in Dunblane,' she said. .I've a picture in the house of him and Jamie, aged two and three, with their little racquets and Wimbledon T-shirts. They're absolutely immersed in their sport, they're tennis geeks, and now they've both got Wimbledon titles.'

She added: 'It just goes to show there's nothing wrong with dreaming, there's nothing wrong with believing; and anything's possible.'
