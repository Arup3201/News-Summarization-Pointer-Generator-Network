An illegal cigarette stash worth £11,000 was discovered inside a hidden compartment at a convenience shop, which could be revealed at the flick of the switch.

The haul of smuggled cigarettes were found at the Supersam Mini Market in Handsworth, Birmingham, with most of them hidden behind a fake roof.

Trading Standards officers, who stormed the shop with police and specialist sniffer dogs, also found hundreds of packets hidden in a hole underneath an ice cream freezer, and rolling tobacco concealed inside a kettle.

A fake cigarette gang was caught hiding their stash of illegal tobacco in this hidden compartment at the Supersam Mini Market in Birmingham, which could be revealed at the flick of the switch

They found the secret roof space, which was fitted with electro magnets and a hidden switch - when they started stripping back the ceiling of the cellar.

In total, they discovered 698 packs of cigarettes in the roof, 339 packs hidden under the freezer and 203 pouches of rolling tobacco, nine of which were in the kettle.

The haul was the second largest ever found in Birmingham, and as a result of the find the owners of the convenience store have lost their licence to sell alcohol.

Trading standards officer Chris Perry told a meeting of Birmingham City Council's licensing sub-committee that the estimated retail costs of the cigarettes would have been £10,957.50.

'This is a very large seizure for such a small shop,' he said.

'It’s probably one of the biggest finds we have had in this area and is the second biggest we have had at a retail premises in the city.

'This was a highly sophisticated concealment which involved electro magnets and a hidden switch.

'Because it was such a large find we think that they were also being supplied to other shops in the area. 

'We firmly believe that they knew exactly what they were doing because of the extensive efforts to conceal the products.'

Despite the tobacco find the committee heard there had been no issues at the shop around the sale of alcohol.

Keith Thomas, representing owner Salam Salih, had argued for suspension and licence conditions instead of revocation.

He said: 'Small businesses are tempted time and again by people offering the sale of these cigarettes.

'Unfortunately he has made an error and he wholeheartedly accepts the foolish mistake he has made.

'He is embarrassed. He did give into temptation and he fully accepts that he used those areas to conceal them.

'On the sale of alcohol it’s very evident that he has been nothing other than compliant.

'The cellar roof and the hole in the floor were in place when he took over the shop in 2009 and he has now sealed them up and permanently covered them.

'He does not believe that the response should be to remove his licence and ultimately his business.'

Sub-committee chairman, Councillor Alex Buchanan said the shop should be barred from selling alcohol.

'The sub-committee has determined that the concealment of the tobacco warrants revocation in order to prevent crime and disorder,' he said.

'In relation to the sophisticated level of concealment, that does not equate squarely with the points raised on his behalf that he gave in to temptation, otherwise a small amount would have been found.

'He could still operate as a mini market without an alcohol licence.'

Speaking after the hearing, Councillor Barbara Dring, chairman of the council's licensing and public protection committee, said: 'Salam Salih has shown a flagrant disregard for the law in the way he runs his shop.

'The business had gone to great lengths to conceal the illicit cigarettes and tobacco, which cannot legally be sold in the UK.'
