Manchester United have suffered yet another injury blow after learning that Luke Shaw could be out for between four and six weeks with ankle ligament damage.

It was initially thought that Shaw might be sidelined for three weeks with the injury he suffered in the first half of last weekend's victory at Arsenal, but scans that had been delayed to allow the swelling on his left ankle to go down yesterday revealed that it could be up to twice as long.

The England defender now stands to miss up to eight Premier League games and an FA Cup third round tie, handing Louis van Gaal yet more problems with his injury-hit defence.
