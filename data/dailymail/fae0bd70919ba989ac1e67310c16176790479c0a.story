Scott Brown insists his Edinburgh escapades are in the past and he is focused on the future.

The Celtic skipper was photographed slumped in a street in the capital only four days before Sunday's League Cup Final against Dundee United.

However, Brown, who picked up his third medal in the tournament and also his first as captain, said: 'I don't think I'm the first player to make a mistake and probably won't be the last.

Brown now insists that he has moved on from the incident, and is focused on winning games for Celtic

'But I've spoken to the manager, it's been dealt with and now all I'm doing is moving on.

'I'm sure the club, the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for Celtic.

'It was a real honour as captain to lift the League Cup on Sunday and we now want to push on and try to bring our fans even more success this season.

'That's all we're thinking about.'

Brown says he has discussed the matter with manager Ronny Deila (right) and the issue is now over
