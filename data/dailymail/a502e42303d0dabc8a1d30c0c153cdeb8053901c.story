The United States government is allegedly in negotiations with National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, it was claimed Tuesday.

Department of Justice officials and Snowden's legal representative recently met to discuss a plea deal that would allow Snowden to return to the U.S.,The Washington Free Beacon said in a report.

Neither the Justice Department nor the lawyer the Free Beacon believes to be representing Snowden, Plato Cacheris, would confirm to the online news outlet that they had met to discuss Snowden, however.

In his first interview with a U.S. TV 
network since leaking information from the NSA, Edward Snowden told NBC News last month that he wants to leave Russia but the United States won't let him

'It remains our position that Mr. Snowden should return to the United 
States and face the charges filed against him,' Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi told the Free Beacon. 'If he does, he will be accorded full due process and protections.'

'There’s nothing to report,' Cacheris said.

Snowden is currently living in Moscow, Russia under government supervision. The country gave him temporary asylum last year, but the one-year deal ends in August.

The NSA leaker is in the process of reapplying for asylum in in Russia, however he has indicated that he does not want to stay there permanently.

Snowden has made efforts to obtain permanent asylum in several European countries, as well as Brazil.

'If Brazil offered me asylum I would accept with pleasure,' Snowden reportedly told a Brazilian news outlet last month. 'I would very much like to live in 
Brazil.'

Last month Snowden told NBC News' Brian Williams that his original plan was to go to Latin America, but, ' I was stopped because the United States government decided to revoke my passport and trap me in Moscow Airport.'

'So when people ask, "Why are you in Russia?" I say, "Please ask the State Department," ' Snowden told him.

'When people say, "Why don’t you go home and face the music?" I say, "You 
have to understand that the music is not an open court and a fair 
trial," ' Snowden said.

Secretary of State John Kerry said the following day that Snowden would come back if her were a 'patriot.'

'A
 patriot would not run away. A patriot would stand up in 
the United States and make his case to the American people,' Kerry told Today show host Savannah Gutherie.

'If he cares so much about America and he believes in America, he should trust the American system of justice,' Kerry said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters the same day that Snowden 'faces felony charges here in the United States
 and he ought to return here to face these charges.

Less than a month ago Snowden told NBC News anchor Brian Williams he can't come home and 'face the music' because 'the music is not an open court and a fair trial'

Snowden has been charged with three separate counts of espionage by the government, including theft of government documents.

Officials familiar with Snowden's talks with federal prosecutors told the Free Beacon that the plea deal under discussion would require Snowden to hand over the documents he stole in exchange for a reduced sentence.

Snowden has publicly said he destroyed the roughly 1.7 million documents, however.

After making copies of NSA files at the facility he worked at in Hawaii, Snowden says he traveled to Hong Kong, where shared his information with reporters for the British news publication The Guardian.

After his business in Hong Kong concluded last summer, Snowden says he got rid of the hard drives containing the documents before continuing on his journey to Latin America.

Some U.S. officials suspect that Snowden still has the documents in his possession, however, and that he may have shared them with the Kremlin.

Snowden has denied that he is working with the Russian government in any capacity, and NSA Director Michael Rogers told Bloomberg News in an interview last week that he believes him.

Rogers said Snowden is 'probably' not a Russian spy, though it is possible. He also acknowledged that Snowden may no longer have the documents in his possession.

Asked in the interview if he thinks the U.S. should consider dropping its charges against Snowden, Rogers said, 'That’s not my decision.'
