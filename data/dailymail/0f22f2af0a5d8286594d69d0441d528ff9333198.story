Labour was accused of ‘staggering hypocrisy’ last night for refusing to publish the names of guests at a lavish fundraising dinner with Ed Miliband.

Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart, Bianca Jagger and Stephen Fry attended the £15,000-a-table ‘gala’ at the Roundhouse in Camden, North London.

Artist Grayson Perry arrived in a sequin dress and green platform shoes while comedian Eddie Izzard had red lipstick and painted nails.

Shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth said Labour was 'demanding to know who is whispering in David Cameron's ear' - but the party led by Miliband (pictured with his wife Justine) would not release its own list

Celebs: The guest list included almost the entire shadow cabinet alongside Eddie Izzard and Patrick Stewart

Former 
cabinet minister Lord Mandelson was joined by TV presenter and Mail 
columnist Janet Street-Porter while ex-leader Neil Kinnock, now Baron 
Kinnock, was with wife Glenys.

Labour
 refused to release the full list of attendees – just days after it 
demanded David Cameron release a list of guests at a similar Tory event 
last week.

Shadow
 Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said last week Labour was 
‘demanding to know who is whispering in David Cameron’s ear’.

But
 the Party would not release its own list, saying the dinner attended by
 virtually the entire shadow Cabinet was a ‘private event’.

Tory MP 
Henry Smith said: ‘Labour’s hypocrisy knows no limit, they say one thing
 then do another – and it’s staggering that they choose the evening 
before their union bosses cripple the country and disrupt millions of 
ordinary people’s lives for their secretive fundraising dinner.’

Eyebrows
 were raised last week as it emerged a guest at the Tory dinner bid 
£160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson in a 
fundraising auction.

It
 later emerged the bidder was Lubov Chernukhin, wife of Vladimir 
Chernukhin, Russia’s former deputy finance minister. Labour’s event 
featured a similarly extravagant auction. 

The top draw was a cast-iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley, with a reserve price of £100,000.

Guests
 could bid for a ceramic pig emblazoned with the words ‘Vote Labour’ by 
Turner Prize winner Mr Perry, at a reserve of £15,000, or a £25,000 
sculpture by Anish Kapoor.

For a 
minimum of £2,500, donors could bid to play five-a-side football against
 a ‘Shadow Cabinet All-Stars’ team with shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, 
health spokesman Andy Burnham, justice spokesman Sadiq Khan and 
international development spokesman Jim Murphy.

For a minimum of £1,000, guests could have Labour-supporting Star Trek star Sir Patrick record their voicemail message.

Competition was expected to be fierce for a week in a Tuscan villa, with a reserve price of £2,000.

A 1997 Labour manifesto signed by Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and David Miliband had a reserve of £2,000.

At a similar event in May, Labour auctioned a signed copy of a speech 
by MP Glenda Jackson, in which she attacked Baroness Thatcher as a 
‘heinous’ individual days after her death.

Supporters
 last night paid up to £15,000 for a ‘premium’ table, where they were 
joined by a ‘political host’ from Labour’s top ranks. The dress code 
was  ‘summer colours – lounge suits/cocktail dresses’.

Despite telling voters there is a cost of living crisis in the UK, the top draw at the Labour summer party was a cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley which had a reserve price of £100,000 and sold for £105,000

Mr Perry said: ‘I think artists are coming back to Labour as there’s no alternative.

Artists are very practical people.’ Asked if Ed Miliband was practical, he added: ‘I think so, we’ll find out.’

The
 main parties insist nothing untoward takes place at such events. But 
they invariably take place behind closed doors, and guest lists are 
rarely released.

Attendees
 last night, who dined on asparagus and monkfish with rhubarb custard to
 follow, included Yasmin Alibhai Brown, Kathy Lette, Geoffrey Robinson, 
Alastair Campbell, Caroline Flint, David Morrissey, Keir Starmer, Larry 
Lamb, Matthew Horne, Melvyn Bragg, Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna, Diane Abbott,
 Peter Mandelson, Chris Hughton, Margaret Hodge and author Jeanette 
Winterson.
