Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, has confessed that he didn't share Neil Armstrong's enthusiasm about the beauty of it when they arrived there.

Speaking to Sir David Frost in an interview airing tonight, he described the moon as 'desolate' and totally lifeless' up close, sharing his first impressions of the moon.

In the interview, he told Sir David he disagrees with Armstrong that the moon was 'beautiful'.

In an interview with Sir David Frost, Buzz Aldrin has said the moon 'wasn't beautiful' but was 'desolate' up close. Pictured are the Apollo 11 astronauts Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin (left to right)

Aldrin talked about the difficult landing that he and Armstrong went through on the Apollo 11 lunar module, which nearly ran out of fuel, before landing on the moon (pictured) 44 years ago

2 men - walked on the moon with the Apollo 11 mission

20 July 1969, 20:18 UTC -  the date Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon

21 hrs 30 minutes - the total time the men spent on the moon's surface

21.5kg - the amount of lunar material Armstrong and Aldrin collected from the moon

Aldrin said: 'Neil had an optimistic way of using the
word "beautiful". 'But when I looked out, it wasn’t beautiful.  It was 
desolate - totally lifeless.

'[There was] really, not much except shades of grey 
and a black horizon. 

'It was magnificent but it’s not very habitable - 
very lifeless.'

He also talked about the difficult 
landing that he and Armstrong went through on the Apollo 11 lunar 
module, which nearly ran out of fuel, before landing on the moon 44 
years ago.

Asked about whether Armstrong prepared 
his famous 'one step for man' line, he said Armstrong had plenty of time
to come up the quotation while they prepared to land on the moon.

He went on to say that Armstrong told
him that he was not sure what he was going to say just before the pair 
took their famous steps on the lunar surface.

Aldrin
said that Michael Collins, who piloted the Apollo 11 spacecraft alone 
while Aldrin and Armstrong moon walked, asked Armstrong what he planned 
on saying as he stepped foot on the moon and Armstrong replied: 'Let's 
get there first'.

Aldrin noted that 'Of course, 
we had a good bit of time getting ready. Several hours' in which 
Armstrong could have come up with his famous quotation.

Looking to the future, Aldrin spoke about his current work in establishing a colony on Mars.

Responding
to critics who question the 
ambitious purpose in spending vast amounts of money to colonise Mars, 
Aldrin said the move is necessary for the survival of the human race.

He
also believes in the power of technology to make it possible, 
exemplified by the rapid progress in Silicon Valley in recent years.

Aldrin is pictured by a window in the lunar 
module following his moonwalk and took a photo of his footprint on the 
moon, which has become synonymous with humankind's venture into space. 
He believes that people could one day live on Mars

He said: 'What did we have in the sixties and 
seventies? Undisputed leadership in the world in technology, as 
exhibited by the Apollo Programme.

'Look at what Silicon Valley has done - the advance of computers. We lead the world…and in these hard economic times, we need to inspire people.'

The programme includes an opportunity for viewers to 
watch the lunar landings, with running commentary by Aldrin and footage 
of his time as a fighter pilot in Korea in the 1950s, which has 
never been seen before.

The Frost/Aldrin interview is the first in Sir David Frost's new series, which begins on Al Jazeera (Freeview channel 83, Sky channel 514) tonight at 9pm and is repeated on Saturday at 1pm.
