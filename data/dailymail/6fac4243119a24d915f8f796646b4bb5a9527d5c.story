Parts of Britain are to be treated to a rare display of the Northern Lights on Friday evening.

The colourful bands of shimmering light are usually only seen in the northerly reaches of Scandinavia, Canada and remote parts of Russia.

But tonight the display, known as the aurora borealis, is forecast to be on show in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The prospect of celestial fireworks in such southerly locations is down to huge explosions on the surface of the Sun.

A solar blast last night hurled vast clouds of magnetically charged particles towards Earth – and another explosion is forecast this evening.

Known as coronal mass ejections, they can produce many colours, with green, pink, red, blue and yellow all possible.

The combined effect of two explosions increases the chance of a display.

As they whip towards the Earth, the particles crash into other particles, accelerating and energising them.

And when they enter our atmosphere they collide with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the air, which when charged, create the shimmering light that we know as the Aurora Borealis.

Often the particles are deflected by the earth’s magnetic field, so the best places to witness it are close to the poles where the field is weakest.

Normally, the earth’s magnetic field funnels the high-energy particles – and so the display - towards the North Pole.

But just occasionally, the sun’s emissions are so violent and so on target, that most of Britain, as far south as East Anglia, gets a ringside seat.

Different colours are created depending on the energy of the incoming particles – and the type of atom they hit in the atmosphere.

For instance, a red glow, which usually occurs high in the sky, is created by lower energy particles interacting with oxygen.

Green lights are caused by slightly more energetic particles, while a purple hue involves nitrogen.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘To view the Northern Lights you are best finding a dark place away from street lights.

‘You will need a cloud-free sky and although there will be some cloud and localised fog patches around this Friday night there should also be some clear skies too.

‘So there is a chance of catching a glimpse of the lights. Your best chance of sighting the aurora will be around midnight.’
