U.S. universities remain atop the list of the world's rankings of the most reputable institutions of higher education, according to the recently released 2014 World Reputation Rankings.

Harvard University in Boston tops the Times Higher Education Reputation Rankings, with Massachusetts Institute of Technology taking the number two spot.

Stanford University in California was ranked third in the world, according to the rankings.

Top: Harvard in the US is ranked highest in the table, based on surveys of 10,536 academics in 150 countries

Mass: Massachusetts Institute of Technology took the number two spot on the Times Higher Education rankings

In all, American universities took 46 of the top 100 positions.

The rankings are based on surveys of 10,536 academics in 150 countries.

In general, the reputations of U.S. universities are gradually improving - for example, New York University has jumped to 27th since 2011, when it was ranked in the 51 to 60 grouping. Columbia University also has seen an improvement in the rankings since 2011, jumping from 23rd to 12th in 2014.

A small number of U.S. universities have been on the decline, however, which has many public universities worried.

'Of the small number of U.S. institutions falling down the list, most are from the public sector and have suffered funding cuts. The prestigious University of California’s top research institutions have collectively suffered and other big name state universities are losing their international status, too,' editor of Times Higher Education rankings Phil Baty told NJ.com. 'This is a worry, as it could lead to a downward spiral, with fewer international scholars wanting to join the institutions. Missed opportunities for global collaboration would lead to further decline.'

In contrast, Britain's ‘Red brick’ universities are sliding down the global league of the most prestigious places to study.

Bristol has followed Leeds and Sheffield in dropping out of a top 100 table which ranks universities according to their reputation around the world.

Manchester, meanwhile, slipped out of the top 50.

The rankings expose a widening gap between a ‘golden triangle’ of universities in London, Oxford and Cambridge and the rest of UK academia.

While each slipping a place to fourth and fifth respectively, Cambridge and Oxford maintain their position in the global elite.

London-based institutions including Imperial College, the London School of Economics, University College London and King’s also perform strongly, either maintaining or improving their rankings.

But other big name British universities - including the ‘red brick’ institutions established in major industrial cities - have taken a hit and the UK’s representation among the top 100 has shrunk since the table was first published in 2011.

Of the rankings of British universities, Baty said: ‘The UK has lost three big-name universities from the list of the world’s 100 most prestigious institutions since the rankings were first published in 2011.

'In 2012, the University of Sheffield exited the rankings, in 2013 the University of Leeds followed suit, and this year the University of Bristol misses out.

‘Given how important global 
reputation is in attracting top international talent, collaborations and
 investment, this is cause for concern. The UK has some of the world’s 
biggest university brands: we must protect them.’ 

Oxford, Cambridge and the University of California, Berkeley complete an elite group of six ‘super-brands’.

Overall, 10 UK universities feature in the World Reputation Rankings top 100, produced by the Times Higher Education magazine - up from nine last year

However, its showing has worsened since 2011 when it had 12 representatives.

Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University College Union, said: ‘The UK continues to punch above its weight on the global stage, but as other countries invest in their universities and move up global league tables, we risk being overtaken.

‘Other countries recognise the value of their universities and if we do not match their investment we will struggle to maintain our position.’
