Amy Pascal has been announced as the new co-producer for the latest Spider-Man installment

Disgraced Sony boss Amy Pascal is returning to the Hollywood studio just three days after it was announced she was leaving.

The executive, whose controversial emails were leaked during the hacking scandal, was revealed as co-producer for the latest installment of the company’s multi-billion pound Spider-Man franchise.

The deal, which named Mrs Pascal as part of the new Spider-Man project came on Monday, just three days after it was said she was leaving her post as the co-chairman of Sony Pictures in May.

She oversaw the franchise for 13 years at Sony and saw it take more than £2.6billion for the studio worldwide.

Part of her deal leaving Sony will see the company fund a production company she is to set up for four years. 

On top of Spider-Man, she is also reported to be under consideration for the re-make of Ghostbusters.

In one of the offensive email exchanges that emerged, Mrs Pascal made racist jokes about the US President, suggesting that he would like films about slavery or that centred on black characters.

‘Should I ask him if he liked Django?,’ she wrote.

In some of the leaked messages Mrs Pascal insulted some of the Hollywood studio’s most bankable stars.

In one discussion, she told a producer who complained about Leonardo DiCaprio that the Wolf of Wall Street star is ‘actually despicable’.

She was also involved in a heated exchange with producer Scott Rudin, where Miss Jolie was accused by Rudin of being a ‘minimally talented spoiled brat’.

The hack attack was linked to North Korea, and is thought to have been an attempt to force Sony to scrap The Interview, a comedy about the assassination of the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. 

Kevin Feige, the producer who has made over $11billion in box office sales, released a statement to say he was working with Mrs Pascal.

'I am thrilled to team with my friends at Sony Pictures along with Amy Pascal to produce the next Spider-Man movie,' he said. 'Amy has been deeply involved in the realization on film of one of the world's most beloved characters. 

'Marvel's involvement will hopefully deliver the creative continuity and authenticity that fans demand from the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). I am equally excited for the opportunity to have Spider-Man appear in the MCU, something which both we at Marvel, and fans alike, have been looking forward to for years.'

Dumped: Andrew Garfield will not be coming back as Spider-Man in the new reboot, due out in 2017

Ancient: At 34, Garfield will be considered too old to play the teenage Peter Parker... if indeed the next Spider-Man is Peter Parker

Hot property: Spider-Man is arguably Marvel's most recognizable superhero, but hasn't been doing that well at the box office under Sony

But the statement did not say if Andrew Garfield would be coming back, almost certainly certainly throwing him in the scrap pile along with Tobey Maguire. 

Marvel's cinema situation is famously a messy one - although the comic house was bought outright by Disney for $4billion in 2009, many of the film rights to its most famous characters had already been sold to rival studios - such as The Fantastic Four and the X-Men to Fox, and Spider-Man to Sony - for far more meager amounts before comic book films were the box office gold they are today.

But Sony has been failing to take advantage of owning arguably Marvel most famous son, Spider-Man, as box office performances have been steadily faltering. 

The most recent film starring Andrew Garfield was murdered at the box office by Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy, despite featuring a far less-known line-up of comic book characters.

The new Spider-Man will make his first appearance in May next year in the eagerly anticipated crossover Civil War, which see's him take the side of Iron Man against Captain America in a war over whether superheros should have to register their powers with the government.

Then on July 28, 2017 the new Spider-man will get his own rebooted film franchise - and speculation is rife over who will done the iconic costume: Garfield will be 34 and considered way too old to play the teenage Peter Parker... if indeed it will be Peter Parker. Many fans are calling for the next Spider-Man to be black teenager Miles Morales, who succeeds Parker in the comics.

NyDailyNews was among the first to propose a list of viable replacements, including Ansel Elgort, Jack O'Connell, Dylan O'Brien, and Logan Lerman.

New boys: Among Spidey's new replacements touted online are The Fault in Our Stars star Ansel Elgort; Unbroken's Jack O'Connell; Teen Wolf Dylan O'Brien; and Fury actor Logan Lerman

Miles better?: Fans have been pushing for the reboot to do away with Peter Parker's well-known origin story, and instead introduce black teen Miles Morales as the man behind the mask
