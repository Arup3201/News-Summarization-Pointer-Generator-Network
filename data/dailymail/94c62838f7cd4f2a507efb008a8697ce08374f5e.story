'The perfect bridge player's death': Wendy Brown died while playing a winning 29-point hand of cards

One of Britain's leading bridge players died immediately after being dealt a 'once in a lifetime' hand because she 'couldn't take the excitement'.

Wendy Brown, 80, collapsed in front of friends while playing a remarkable 29-point game but even her heartbroken son admitted today: 'It was a lovely way for her to go'.

The grandmother of 12 suffered heart failure at the John Betjeman Centre in Wadebridge, Cornwall, during her regular Tuesday night bridge night.

Bereft friends said today they were in shock, but admitted it is the 'perfect bridge player's death'.

In the panic nobody checked her cards but she may have had four aces, four kings, and a jack - almost unheard of in bridge circles.

She had played the game for five decades and achieved the hallowed status of Premier Life Master, but experts said today a 29-point game is so rare it is unlikely she ever had one.

Her son Charlie said: 'I can imagine the smile on her face when she looked at her cards and she knew she had a winning hand. She died doing what she loved to do.

'The other members of the bridge club responded magnificently and tried everything to revive her.

'But when all is said and done, it was a lovely way to go.

Remarkable: In the chaos after the much-loved grandmother died nobody noted down her hand, but experts have speculated it probably had four aces and perhaps four kings

'Her death was obviously a great shock and was very sudden, but looking back we are very happy she went this way.

'When I go myself I would love to think I'll go out like this, doing something I love.'

The maximum points total for a bridge hand is 37, meaning she had almost three-quarters of the scoring cards in a pack.

He said: 'An hour and a half in there was this cry from her partner "get an ambulance".

'In effect she played this remarkable hand and collapsed and died immediately afterwards.

Each of the four players, split into two teams, receives 13 cards in a hand. The object of bridge is to win tricks.

Each person will 'bid' for tricks, based on how many they believe their cards can help them win.

They will make this 'bid' based on the number of scoring cards they have.

These are as follows:

Ace: Four points

King: Three points

Queen: Two points

Jack: One point

There are 13 tricks to be won and a trick consists of four cards - one from each player.

The highest card wins the trick, unless a trump card is laid.

In this instance, experts have suggested that the winning hand contained a jack, four kings and four aces.

'Wendy had 29 points in her hand. I haven't seen a 29 point hand, if ever, or certainly not for a very long time.

'I can't remember seeing one with more points than that in the past 18 years or so.

'Wendy will no doubt have been extremely excited by getting such a hand. My theory is that she couldn't take the excitement.

'It's very sad but what a way to go. It's the perfect bridge player's death'.

Wendy was sitting around the table with her close pal Mimi Falconar, 66, when she slumped forward in her chair.

Another close friend and playing partner, Maureen Brinton rushed over to help, but by then Wendy was already dead.

Mimi
 said: 'She was delighted to have played that hand. She hadn't even put 
her cards away when she went, it was very sudden. I knew instantly she 
was gone.

'Wendy was exceptionally kind, terrific fun to play with, and she'd been playing for donkey's years.

'If
 you had asked her a fortnight earlier how she would have liked to go 
she would have said: at the card table. Bridge was her joy.'

Tragedy: The bridge 'doyenne' fell ill at the John Betjeman Centre, an old railway station at Wadebridge, Cornwall
