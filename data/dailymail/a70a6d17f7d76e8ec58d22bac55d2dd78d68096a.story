Lionel Messi edged closer to the all-time top league scorer record in Spain with a first half goal against Rayo Vallecano, but then missed a hatful of second half opportunities to go past it.

The Argentine scored league goal No 249 of his career leaving him just two behind Telmo Zarra’s 251 haul. If he fails to score twice in Barcelona’s next game against Eibar then the Clasico at the Santiago Bernabeu may well be the scene of him eclipsing all of Spanish league scorers and claiming the record.

His second misses did not matter too much in this game as Barça brushed aside an over-adventurous Rayo whose case was not helped by being reduced to nine men.

The Madrid-based minnows started brightly and former Real Madrid youngster Alberto Bueno could have put them ahead on eight minutes but his shot was saved by Claudio Bravo.

The Chilean goalkeeper was back in the team having been left out of the midweek Champions League defeat to Paris Saint-Germain and when he passed the 20 minute mark without conceding it meant he broke Pedro Artola’s record from the 1977-78 season of going 560 minutes without being beaten at the start of the campaign.

Soon Barcelona began to create openings and only a fine save from Toño kept out Leo Messi on 13 minutes. Rayo were showing the Argentine no respect and both centre-backs Abdoulaye and Morcillo were booked for late challenges from behind.

Rayo were playing a very high line and a risky offside trap and it finally came unstuck on 35 minutes when a flighted ball from Gerard Pique put Messi through. He still had work to do but he headed the ball clear of defender Morcillo and lofted it over the out-rushing Toño to get his sixth league goal of the season.

Neymar had looked out of sorts in the opening exchanges mis-controlling one throw from Mathieu straight out of play, but after Messi’s strike he responded with a goal of his own inside the next minute.

Again it was a long ball from the back, this time from Bartra and when Munir muscled off two Rayo defenders he played in the Brazilian who finished for his seventh league goal of this campaign. 

Bang, bang, Barça's deadly front two had killed the game inside 60 seconds.

Munir should have been awarded a penalty when brought down by Toño so Rayo were lucky to go in at half time only 2-0 down. The aggregate score in this fixture form the two sides’ last three meetings was 16-0 coming into the match and they looked so open at the back, another drubbing looked on the cards.

In the second half Rayo had the first chance when Baptistao forced a save from Bravo but it was not long before the job became even harder. Morcillo went through the back of Neymar and was sent off for his second yellow card. Gung-ho boss Paco Jemez had already taken off one of his two centre-backs and now his other one had been sent off.

Ivan Rakitic was on for Andres Iniesta and he had Barça’s next shot palmed away by Toño. Rakitic then set up Messi but Toño pushed the ball out for a corner.

Messi had two more clear-cut chances from Xavi passes but against a weak side down to ten-men Barça had very much gone back down the gears with the clock ticking down and there was some uncharacteristically poor finishing from their talisman.

He missed again this time from a Pique ball over the top of the defence. Rayo sub Aquino was sent off completing the home side’s dismal afternoon and Barça took the points and made it seven straight clean sheets in the league.

Messi now goes away on international duty just two goals short of that all-time record… and one game away from the Bernabeu.
