He's most famous for bending spoons and mixing with the rich and famous, but a new documentary claims Uri Geller has also been leading a secret life as a CIA spy.

And the controversial paranormalist has even admitted he was once asked to use telepathy to stop a pig's heart, but he refused as he suspected he would next be asked to perform the act on a human.

Geller's life as a covert spy has been revealed in a new documentary by Vikram Jayanti, The Secret Life of Uri Geller - Psychic Spy?

Uri Geller's secret life as a CIA spy has been revealed in a new documentary

The film explores work Geller is said to have carried out for military and intelligence agencies across three continents.

The film, which was premiered at the Sheffield Doc Fest and will be broadcast by the BBC later this year, includes interviews with those who had first-hand knowledge of Geller's work, including former CIA officer Kit Green and retired army colonel John Alexander, who featured in journalist Jon Ronson's book The Men Who Stare At Goats.

Geller, who attended the premiere, has said he is concerned at the way he is revealed as a spy in the film.

Speaking to The Independent, Geller said: 'I didn’t realise that Vikram was going to do such a thorough job of tying all the loose ends... making that the little hints I dropped throughout my career were real.'

He also said he refused to carry out 'dark things' and only executed 'positive' missions.

The film suggests Geller attempted to erase the contents of floppy disks being carried by Soviet diplomats in Mexico back to Russia and even disable radar when Israeli commandos stormed a hijacked plane during the 'raid on Entebbe'.

Film-maker Jayanti suggests the US recruited Geller during a 'psychic arms race' with the Soviet Union, although it is believed he came to the attention of the CIA while he was already working for the Israeli military.

While Geller remains coy about his involvement in covert operations during the film, he is happy to reveal how he obtained his surprise Mexican citizenship - by pinpointing where to drill for oil.

Geller has said he first became aware of his abilities at the age of five when a spoon curled up in his hand and broke during a meal.

He says he went on to develop the powers by demonstrating them to pupils at his school

His mother meanwhile believed he inherited them from distant relative Sigmund Freud.
