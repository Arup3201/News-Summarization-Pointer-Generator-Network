If you wore a watch that didn’t tell the time, you might get a few strange looks.

But this gadget - which doesn’t have hands or digital numbers - claims to give an ‘enlightening’ sense of your days passing by vibrating every five minutes.

Instead of a traditional clock face, the Durr watch gives timely notifications to alert a wearer that they may be spending more - or less -  time than necessary on daily tasks.

The Durr watch, created by Oslo-based designers, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, gives the wearer timely notifications by vibrating every five minutes

Oslo-based designers, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, created Durr as an experiment, according to Aaron Souppouris at The Verge.

After a conversation about how quickly a day at the office had gone, they wondered if there was a simple way they could keep track of time.

They created a prototype of Durr in just half an hour and were excited enough by the design to develop an initial run the next morning for sale. 

The Norwegian duo, who work together under the name Skrekkøgle, said that after wearing the watch for six months, it added a certain rhythm to each day

To their surprise, the first batch of 50 £75 watches sold out in a just over six weeks.

The designeres wanted Durr to draw attention to the difference between time as it passes and how we perceive it passing.

The design features a colourful fabric circle with a simple brown leather strap and a small button to turn vibration on and off.

The Norwegian duo, who work together under the name Skrekkøgle, said that after wearing the watch for six months, it added a certain ‘rhythm’ to each day.

Others, however, have criticised it for being nothing more than an expensive ‘egg timer on a strap’.

Mr Tveterås said the feedback from other people was it acts a like a countdown to their death ‘which wasn’t the intention at all’.

‘But the memento mori aspect is very fascinating too.’

The original units were constructed on a small scale, pieced together and dyed by hand, but the designers are now planning a much larger production run.
