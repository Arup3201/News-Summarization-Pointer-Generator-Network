The German magazine Der Spiegel published an open letter it says was written by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden titled, A Manifesto for the Truth, in which Snowden said calls for surveillance program reforms justify his alleged decision to leak classified information.

'Citizens have to fight against the suppression of information about affairs of essential importance for the public,' Snowden wrote according to a translation by Reuters. 'Those who speak the truth are not committing a crime.'

'Instead of causing damage, the usefulness of the new public knowledge for society is now clear because reforms to politics, supervision and laws are being suggested,' he wrote.

Snowden
calls the U.S. and British intelligence agencies the 'worst offenders,'
but adds, 'we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem 
and needs a global solution,' according to a CNN translation.

'The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,' he wrote.

'While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders -- at least according to the documents that are currently public -- we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution

Der Spiegel claims the letter was written Friday in Moscow.

Snowden's
'manifesto' follows his request for clemency to the U.S. government for
his alleged crimes, made public in a letter released Friday after being
delivered to a German politician.

The Obama administration made it clear it has no intention of being lenient with Snowden.

'Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,' White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer said Sunday.

'He
should return to the U.S. and face justice,' Pfeiffer said, adding when
pressed that no offers for clemency were being discussed.

Snowden. 30, fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges.

He has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.

A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.

The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs.

The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance 'with a never before seen witch hunt' that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs.

In the letter, translated by CNN, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change.

'The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,' the letter said.'And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws.'

President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually.

Snowden has been spotted only a handful of times in Moscow.

The Russians imply there is a risk he could be kidnapped or assassinated by the CIA.

Western sources say the fact he is being concealed in Russia shows he is under the control of the Moscow secret services.

A picture purporting to show Snowden was released on Thursday by a Russian site with close ties to the secret services.

He was wearing a cap, without glasses, leaning on the rail of a tour boat on the Moscow River. In the background is Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral.

The same website earlier this month published a photograph of Snowden pushing a shopping trolley, later confirmed as authentic by his Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena.

The photograph 'proves that the former US agent either lives permanently in Moscow or visits regularly,' claimed the site.
