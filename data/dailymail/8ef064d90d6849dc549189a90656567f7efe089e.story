The Premier League may only be four games old but there have already been plenty of twists and turns. Chelsea have continued their 100 per cent start to the season, the only side in England with such a record, while Louis van Gaal's new-look Manchester United finally recorded a win.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. It's no surprise that Diego Costa tops the leaderboard after his hat-trick against Swansea but who else makes the top 10 in our Player Performance Index PPI chart?

Chelsea's Diego Costa tops Premier League's Player Performance Index after three goals against Swansea

10. Romelu Lukaku, Everton (PPI score: 34.5)

Everton got their season back on track with a comfortable 2-0 victory at The Hawthorns over West Bromwich Albion and Romelu Lukaku starred for Roberto Martinez's men.

The big Belgian led the line well and netted a wonderful curling effort from the edge of the box.

One goal from three efforts - two of which were on target - is not a bad return at all from the £28million man. Three completed dribbles also contributed to his score.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester City (35.5)

Leonardo Ulloa has started life at Leicester City with a bang and he once again popped up with an invaluable goal.

The striker's smart finish gave the Foxes all three points against Stoke City at the notoriously tricky Britannia Stadium.

As well as his goal, Ulloa completed 19 passes in the opposition half as he menaced the Stoke defence all afternoon. 

8. Jack Cork, Southampton (36.0)

Unsurprisingly Southampton have three names in the top 10 this week after their 4-0 thrashing of Newcastle United at St Mary's.

Jack Cork makes the list after bagging his first goal for the club.

Two interceptions and an 88.4 per cent pass-completion rate highlight just how splendid an outing Cork had against the toothless Magpies.

7. Morgan Schneiderlin, Southampton (36.5)

Saints' second entry sees French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin make the list at No 7 with a score of 36.5.

Despite asking to leave the south coast this summer, Schneiderlin has since knuckled down and performed superbly for Southampton, capping off the Saints' victory over Newcastle with a curler into the top corner.

The industrious midfielder won seven tackles and completed 91.3 per cent of his passes, giving the visiting side no time to breathe in the middle of the park.

6. Angel di Maria, Manchester United (38.3)

Van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford is finally taking shape and Angel di Maria is going to be right at the forefront of it.

The flying winger scored a goal - albeit somewhat fortuitously from a free-kick that found its way past everyone in the box and into the back of the net - and looked dangerous throughout Manchester United's 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers.

The Argentine also bagged an assist and completed 80.3 per cent of the 76 passes he attempted.

5. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United (41.5)

United captain Wayne Rooney continues to grow into his new role and he oversaw his first competitive victory as skipper against QPR.

The England striker scored, assisted and completed 89.4 per cent of the 66 passes he attempted.

Rooney will hope this performance helped secure his place in the side ahead of Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie.

4. Ander Herrera, Manchester United (42.4)

A first goal at Old Trafford for summer-signing Ander Herrera capped off a composed and impressive display for the midfielder. He is the third United player in the top 10.

The Spaniard's 77 per cent completion rate from 52 attempted passes and his assist show his attacking strengths.

But Herrera also won eight tackles, showing he can really get stuck in for United.

3. Jack Wilshere, Arsenal (44.5)

It has been quite a week for Jack Wilshere. First, an impressive display for England in holding midfield and then a rampaging performance in attacking midfield for Arsenal.

Wilshere scored a sublime goal during the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Manchester City after completing one of the 10 successful dribbles he recorded on Saturday.

An 80 per cent pass-completion rate from 65 attempts is also a decent return.

2. Graziano Pelle, Southampton (52) 

Southampton's third and final player to make the top 10 is the extremely impressive and imposing figure of Graziano Pelle.

The Italian forward scored just six minutes into the hammering of Newcastle - and added a second shortly afterwards as he terrorised Fabricio Coloccini and Mike Williamson.

Pelle's brace came from just five shots at goal, with three of those finding the target. An excellent conversion rate for any striker.

1. Diego Costa, Chelsea (72.9)

Chelsea's hitman Diego Costa once again storms to the top of the list with a mammoth score of 72.9 after his brilliant treble against Swansea during the Blues' 4-2 win.

The Spaniard is more than 20 points clear of second place after making it seven goals in just four Premier League games.

Most impressively, those three strikes came from just four shots on target - a quite remarkable conversion rate - and he completed 85.7 per cent of the passes he attempted.

Costa is going to take some stopping this season, that's for sure.
