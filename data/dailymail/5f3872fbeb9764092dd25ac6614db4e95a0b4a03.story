Tens of thousands of primary pupils are sitting tougher exams brought back by Michael Gove in 2012

Tens of thousands of 11-year-olds are being stretched by more difficult tests that have been revived by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Only the brightest pupils are expected to pass the tougher versions of Level 6 exams.

Labour axed the exams, which test 11-year-olds with material more suitable for 14-year-olds, in 2002 before the Coalition brought them back in 2012 for maths and reading.

Last year, the tests were also brought in for grammar, punctuation and spelling.

From 2016, the current standard tests for 11-year-olds will be replaced by a compulsory exam which will include many of the harder questions asked in the Level 6 papers.

It means all youngsters will be expected to be taught at a higher level to meet the tougher exam requirements.

Currently, the Level 6 is optional and teachers tend to test only the most academic pupils with it. But figures released today show that primary schools are increasingly using them to challenge students and raise aspiration.

Last year, just 3 per cent – 2,200 out of 70,000 pupils – who sat the reading exam reached a Level 6 pass. Just 8,500 out of 59,000 passed the spelling, punctuation and grammar test (14 per cent) while under half – 35,000 out of 78,000 – passed the maths test.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We brought back these tests because we wanted to give teachers the chance to set high aspirations for pupils in literacy and numeracy.

‘We want to see every school stretching all their pupils. These figures show that primary schools have embraced the opportunity to stretch their brightest 11-year-olds by  teaching them more demanding new material, in line with the new curriculum, and by entering them for the Level 6 test.’

Mr Gove has said: ‘It is plain wrong to set a ceiling on the talents of the very brightest pupils and let them drift in class.

'Letting teachers offer Level 6 tests means that the most talented children will be fully stretched and start secondary school razor-sharp.’

To achieve a Level 6 in reading, children have to trace an idea, explore different levels of meaning in a text and explain how a writer tries to influence a reader.

Those sitting a Level 6 in maths have to convert between fractions, decimals and  percentages, explain number patterns through graphs and algebra and understand formulae for calculating volume and area.

To gain a Level 6 in grammar, punctuation and spelling, pupils must use complex  nouns, a range of verb forms and understand subordinate clauses as well as use semi-colons properly.
