Australian airline Qantas has removed pork from its in-flight menu on routes to and from Europe after going into partnership with Middle Eastern airline Emirates.

No food containing pork or pork products will be served on the European flights - which now have a stopover in Dubai - because pork is considered 'unholy' and therefore strictly forbidden by Islam.

All meals offered on the route in first, business and economy classes will also be prepared without alcohol in keeping with the Islamic religion.

Pork sausages are now banned from Qantas flights through Europe after a merger with Emirates

The Qantas pork ban comes as other 
airlines - in the wake of the Qantas-Emirates merger - jostle for market
 share by aggressively discounting fares from Australia to Europe.

A note on the Qantas menus on flights in and out of Dubai states that the meals do not contain pork products or alcohol.

The airline has also introduced a mezze plate, offering traditional Middle Eastern fare in its upper classes, and has Arabic translations after in-flight announcements.

A Qantas spokesman said the decision to remove pork, ham and other related food items had had minimal impact on its menu, and said it was still offering the same meal choices.

'Qantas in-flight catering often reflects the cultural and regional influences of the international destinations we fly to,' he said.

'On flights to and from Hong Kong and China, our menus include regionally inspired dishes such as stir fries and to Singapore we have noodle options.'

Qantas also offers meals without pork and alcohol on flights to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, which also has a large Muslim population.

Several other airlines which fly from Australia to the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia do not serve pork either.

Virgin Australia does not serve pork on flights to and from Abu Dhabi and all meals that are prepared are halal accredited, with meat prepared in a way prescribed by Islamic law.

Qantas passengers heading to any European city now fly via Dubai instead of Singapore, as they did under the airline's previous longstanding partnership with British Airways.
