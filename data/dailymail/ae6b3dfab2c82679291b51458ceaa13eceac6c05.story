A nurse who is obsessed with visiting the graves of notable people has spent more than £50,000 on travelling the world visiting cemeteries.

For 30 years, Mark Dabbs has spent his holidays paying his respects to figures such as statesmen, Hollywood actors and philosophers, either alone or accompanied by his tolerant girlfriend Tracey.

He has compiled an impressive photo album showing himself posing alongside more than 200 graves across six continents.

Significant: The grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination sparked the First World War, in Austria

Power: Mr Dabbs next to the grave of U.S. president Grover Cleveland in New Jersey

Mr Dabbs, from Walsall in the West Midlands, has visited the tombs of men as influential as U.S. president Grover Cleveland, in New Jersey, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Austria.

The 48-year-old also travelled to Switzerland, where Charlie Chaplin is buried, and to Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb in Paris.

To hunt down stars from the showbiz past he has been to the U.S., to see Bruce Lee in Seattle, Dean Martin in Las Vegas and Johnny Ramone in Los Angeles.

Mr Dabbs has a special interest in the pioneer outlaws of the Wild West, as shown by his visits to the graves of Buffalo Bill in North Dakota and Calamity Jane in Arizona.

Closer to home, a trip to Highgate Cemetery allowed him to capture photos of the final resting places of Karl Marx and entertainer Jeremy Beadle.

And he was particularly excited to visit the town of Tombstone, Arizona, which got its unusual name from being the site of the Gunfight at the OK Corral.

He says that one inspiration for his bizarre hobby is a desire to educate himself about important figures from the past.

'I wasn't very good at history at school and I didn't learn very much,' he said.

'This is my way of educating myself, I visit famous people from history and I learn something new every time I do.

'Somehow visiting the resting places of the dead makes them seem more alive.'

While some might find Mr Dabbs's interests off-putting, his girlfriend Tracey has accepted his unusual tastes and even agreed to accompany him on his grave tours.

'She wasn't convinced at first but I have converted her, now she comes with me all over the world to visit famous graves,' he said.

Leader: János Kádár, a leading figure in the Communist Party, is another Hungarian to have received a visit from the enthusiastic traveller in Budapest

'Some people do think it's morbid but I find it fascinating.

'I've now been visiting famous graves for 30 years and I don't think I will ever stop.'

He aims to visit the graves of every American president and British prime minister, as well as those of all six of Henry VIII's wives.

After visiting more than 200 graves, you might expect them all to blend 
into one - but some of Mark Dabbs's destinations are more memorable than
others.

The grave of pioneering punk rocker Johnny Ramone 
(1948-2004) in Los Angeles features a lifesize depiction of him playing 
the guitar.

By contrast, crooner Dean Martin (1917-95) is 
commemorated by nothing more than a small plaque in Las Vegas reading: 
'Everybody loves somebody sometime'.

While many of the tombs are 
situated outdoors in public cemeteries, when Mr Dabbs paid his respects 
to Jane Austen (1775-1817) he had to visit Winchester Cathedral, where 
the novelist is buried beneath the nave.

Some sites hosted more than 
one notable figure - for example, Highgate Cemetery is the final resting
place of two men as different as Communist philosopher Karl Marx 
(1818-83) and beloved TV presenter Jeremy Beadle (1948-2008).

Perhaps
the most historically significant grave visited by Mr Dabbs is that of 
Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1863-1914), whose assassination sparked the 
First World War and who is buried alongside his wife in his ancestral 
castle in Austria.
