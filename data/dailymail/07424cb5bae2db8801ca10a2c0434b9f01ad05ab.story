In a bizarre tribunal case a hospital employee will be awarded substantial compensation after management wrongly thought that he had sexual contact with a corpse. 

The Department for Health and Ageing were ordered by a Workers Compensation Tribunal to pay compensation to an employee at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Adelaide for emotional trauma after it was wrongly assumed he was facing trial for necrophilia.

In Judge Leonie Farrell’s judgement she said that in October 2012 the worker’s relationship with his partner broke down, The Advertiser reported. He was charged with aggravated assault by his ex-partner and had to inform his employer of this. 

The man was working at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide when he was suspended 

The worker spoke to his operations manager about the alleged assault case where the manager made notes of their conversation. It was here where all the confusion began.

'(The operations manager wrote) he faced allegations of ‘necrophilia, intercourse with a corpse located at the QEH morgue which apparently everyone knows about’,' Judge Farrell said.

Other allegations made against the worker by his ex-partner was that he was a 'pornographic king'. 

Judge Farrell said the operations manager was 'unfamiliar with criminal procedure' and 'saw no distinction' between a charge and an allegation.

A hospital operations manager wrongly assumed during an interview with the employee that he was facing trial for necrophilia 

The worker was suspended from his job as it was believed 'he had been charged with interfering with a body in the morgue'.  

It was Judge Farrell's view that the operations manager misunderstood what the worker was telling her about the necrophilia allegation.

'She did not do so deliberately or maliciously ... it was a simple misunderstanding resulting from her unfamiliarity with the matters being raised,' the judge said.

As the aggravated assault case progressed through the justice system, the worker was diagnosed HIV-positive and began to suffer anxiety issues. 

An appropriate award of compensation for the hospital employee is now being worked out

South Australia Police later confirmed that 'the comments made by the ex-partner appeared to have no substance'. 

It was ruled that it was clear there had been a misunderstanding, that the worker had not breached the code of ethics and should never have been suspended.

The matter was adjourned to hear submissions on the appropriate award of compensation.
