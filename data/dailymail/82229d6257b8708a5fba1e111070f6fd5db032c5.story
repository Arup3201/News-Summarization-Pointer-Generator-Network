Rapper Macklemore appeared at the 20th anniversary celebration of a Seattle drug court and spoke about his experiences with alcohol.

'Hi, I'm Ben,' the rapper said while sitting on the front bench at Kings County Juvenile Drug Court, according to The Seattle Times. 'And I'm an alcoholic.'

The newspaper reported that he spoke to the crowd about halfway through the event about the days when he was simply Ben Haggerty, a 15-year-old Seattle youth struggling with an alcohol and drug problem who ended up in the Kings County Juvenile Drug Court.

'Drug court gives people a way to get sober, to heal,' Macklemore also said. 'I don’t want to just get through the day. I want to live. That is what Drug Court is to me.'

Macklemore earlier 'was just a part of the audience, clapping for other graduates and listening to the history of the program,' according to the newspaper. 

Certain defendants can receive drug treatment as opposed to being locked up, the newspaper reported. King County's was only the nation's 12th drug court when it opened in 1994. 

Since then, officials say 2,050 defendants have graduated and had their charges dismissed, The Seattle Times reported.
