Mercedes-Benz is at the centre of a row over safety standards after the discovery of an electrical fault that causes wiring in the boot of some saloons to burn out.

After receiving more than 400 complaints, including five reported boot fires, America’s motoring safety watchdog ordered the firm to recall cars deemed to be at risk, warning that the fault could ‘increase the risk of a crash’.

The problem has led to the recall of more than 250,000 cars in the United States. 

The US motoring watchdog has ordered Mercedes to recall C-Class cars made between 2008 and 2011 after five reported boot fires - but no safety warning has been issued in the UK (file picture)

But no official warning has been issued by Britain’s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) to the estimated 50,000 motorists who may be affected.

The problem affects cars built between 2008 and 2011 in the C-Class range, which would have cost up to £30,000. In Britain, the cost of repairing the fault would be about £500.

Dr Zafar Khan, from Banstead, Surrey, said C-Class owners like him had been left in the dark, adding: ‘No explanation has been given for the anomaly over the way matters are dealt with here and in the United States.

Last night Mercedes-Benz confirmed that British models had the same fault as US cars, but a spokesman said: ‘Investigations consistently found that a recall is not required under UK standards.’

The DVSA said: ‘The manufacturers are working closely with customers affected by this issue.’

Two weeks ago the company was forced to recall more than 8,000 C-Class saloons because of a steering wheel fault.
