Jose  Callejon's first-half strike helped ease the pressure on Napoli manager Rafael Benitez with a 1-0 win away at Sassuolo in Serie A - hours after the Spanish boss was backed to continue in his job by a member of the club's board.

The former Liverpool and Chelsea manager picked up just his second league win of the season against the minnows who just escaped relegation last year, and seems to have the support of at least some of the club's hierarchy.

Fans have stayed away from the Gli Azzurri's Stadio San Paolo home this season, frustrated at the team's lacklustre performances and failure to qualify for the Champions League.

But Benitez received a double-boost this weekend with the news of Riccardo Bigon's backing - and taking three points from the trip to the Mapei Stadium.

'Benitez is a coach of immense experience and excellent results. He has won several trophies at clubs without huge tradition,' Napoli director Bigon said.

'Obviously at this moment he is very concentrated and is perhaps not too focused on speaking to the media. In these situations, the best thing is to lock down with the team and work.

'His career and his working methods cannot be put in doubt.'

Spanish striker Callejon scored the only goal of the game in Sassuolo, knocking in a brilliant cross from Gonzalo Higuain at the back post just before the half-hour mark.

Federico Peluso has a shot deflected onto the crossbar for the hosts late on but Napoli clung on to claim just their second league win of the season.

Higuain was at the heart of everything good for the Naples outfit and assisted the winner for Callejon

'Our team over the last two seasons has been attack-minded and in fact we are the only side that plays regularly with four forwards,' Bigon added, speaking to Sky Sport Italy.

'Last season we scored 104 goals. Balance is important and we are a little forward-heavy, but that just means we have to do even better.'
