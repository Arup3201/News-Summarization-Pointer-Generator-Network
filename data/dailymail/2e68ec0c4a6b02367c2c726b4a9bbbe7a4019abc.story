Dejan Lovren has given an insight into Liverpool's pre-match preparations by posting a picture of him and team-mate Mario Balotelli on the train to London.

Liverpool face Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, and the Reds squad travelled first class to the capital on Monday.

After Raheem Sterling's second-half equaliser at Anfield, Liverpool are on level terms with their opponents ahead of the winner-takes-all clash.

Brendan Rodgers confirmed that Mario Balotelli will have another chance to prove himself at Liverpool

The victor will take on either Tottenham or Sheffield United, after their second leg decides a winner on Wednesday.

Lovren's picture, posted on his Instagram to 226,000 followers, showed him with his feet up on a Virgin train, while Balotelli posed in the background.

The Italy striker has had a difficult season at Anfield, but was backed by manager Brendan Rodgers on Monday morning.

In his press conference, Rodgers claimed that Balotelli will be given another chance to forge a career at the club - and that he is ready to fight for his place.

A cloud has hung over Balotelli’s future at Anfield for many months but Rodgers is not yet ready to call time on his chances of making a contribution and does not see the imminent return of Daniel Sturridge as a barrier to his prospects.

‘We will give Mario every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We brought him here to show consistently he can play at the top level. It has been a difficult period but he is a good boy who wants to fight for his place. Players have been out of the fold but shown they can get back in and stay in.

‘It doesn’t matter whether Daniel Sturridge is coming back. It improves our squad. They played well together at Tottenham. We will see how Daniel is today [Monday]. He trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked.

‘We won’t risk him, that is for sure. We need to make sure he is ready and feels ready. He won’t be 100 per cent when he comes back. He will need game time, but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally.’

Rodgers, meanwhile, has urged his squad to exploit any lingering hangover Chelsea are suffering from the way they capitulated against Bradford; Liverpool’s manager recognises the threat of Jose Mourinho’s side and is respectful of them but, equally, he feels his own troops have nothing to lose.

Liverpool finished the first leg in the ascendance last Tuesday and Rodgers feels they played well enough to have won comfortably. He now wants his players to replicate that effort and secure the club’s first trip to Wembley since 2012.

‘The result at the weekend does not help,’ said Rodgers. ‘They will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but there is also in the back of your mind even if you are 2-0 up you can lose so there can be trepidation.

‘It is a different game at Stamford Bridge but we were a real threat going forward and good defensively. We controlled the counter-attack really well and looked a threat going forward. I thought we took that into Bolton but could not get the goal.

‘The team is on the up and confidence is really high. We have great confidence. It is very important and we will do everything we can to get there. Winning a trophy is a priority and it is a one-off game to get us there.’
