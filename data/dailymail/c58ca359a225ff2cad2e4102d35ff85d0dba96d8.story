The rabies-infected man whose organs went to four people, including a kidney recipient who died, is now revealed to have been bitten by raccoons at least twice in the months before he died.

Tests have now also confirmed his rabies-infected kidney caused the recipient's disease and subsequent death and that the rabies originated from raccoons.

Doctors initially attributed the death of U.S. Air Force recruit William Edward Small to other causes, but an investigation prompted by the kidney recipient's death in February found evidence of rabies in the Small’s brain tissue and also brain inflammation, which can be caused by rabies.

No idea: William Edward Small, 20, had been in the military just a short time when he died and his organs were donated to four recipients in four states. Doctors at the time thought he'd eaten tainted fish

The virus was consistent with raccoon rabies and was nearly identical to a virus found in the transplanted kidney and other tissue from the recipient, an Army veteran from Maryland, said the report, compiled by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others and published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Investigators don't know if organs given to three other patients — the Small’s heart, liver and second kidney-were infected with the rabies virus, but all three were considered at risk. Their recipients received anti-rabies treatment ‘and to date remain well,’ said CDC researcher Dr. Neil Vora, the lead author.

Unfortunate: Small's son Shane is seen here with his mother Alecia Mercer. When Mercer learned that Small had died of rabies, she wasn't surprised. 'He did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff.' she said, though Small was never tested

Warning signs: A wall of Small's bedroom in Trenton, North Carolina. It has been revealed that Small was bitten by two raccoons prior to his death from rabies and the farming of his organs that killed one kidney recipient

While the case is rare, it underscores the need to improve screening for would-be organ donors with suspected encephalitis, the report's authors say. They say a uniform donor questionnaire could help better identify risk factors for the virus and that rabies should be considered in donors with unexplained encephalitis.

Doctors in Florida didn't test 20-year-old Small for rabies before he died and his heart, liver and kidneys were donated to recipients in Florida, Georgie, Illinois and Maryland.

The recipient in Maryland received an infected kidney and died 18 months after Small. The patients who received the man's other organs started getting the rabies vaccine this month, but none of them has shown symptoms of the rare disease.

Tragic: Small showed signs of rabies before his death, but his body wasn't tested for the disease before his organs were farmed out to four recipients in four states, one of whom died 18 months later

Deadly: It took 18 months for the kidney recipient to die of a rabies infection, which is almost unheard of. The further from the brain, the longer the infection takes to spread. Small was bitten months before his death

Rabies is a deadly viral infection that usually occurs when a person is bitten by an infected animal.

The most common animal to infect humans is the raccoon, and some believe incidences will rise as the creatures become more common in urbanized areas.

The time between the infection and when symptoms occur, the incubation period, ranges from as short as 10 days to as long as seven years. The average period is three to 12 weeks.

Symptoms generally include: drooling, convulsions, excitability, loss of muscle function, muscle spasms, numbness and tingling, difficulty swallowing.

Untreated, rabies can lead to coma and death.

Once rabies symptoms appear, the person infected rarely survives the disease, even with treatment.

An estimated 55,000 deaths from rabies occur around the world each year. An estimated two deaths from rabies occur in the U.S. each year.

The majority of those infected die from respiratory failure, which typically occurs within seven days from when symptoms begin.

Alecia Mercer, the mother of his young son, originally revealed that Small was the infected donor.

Mercer said she wasn't surprised to learn that Small had died of rabies, and not a stomach virus as she’d been told, because he liked to hunt and trap animals.

'He did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff,' she said. 'He did the trapping, and he didn't care what the animal looked like. He just picked it up.'

Small had been in the Air Force for 17 weeks before he died. He was in Florida to train as aviation mechanic. He visited a clinic at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in August 2011 for abdominal pain and vomiting and was transferred to a civilian hospital four days later

Small's initial symptoms included nausea, vomiting and fever — which could indicate rabies but also other less serious conditions that are much more common. Doctors thought Small had eaten tainted fish.

The United Network for Organ Sharing issued guidance last year to help organ procurement organizations screen for encephalitis and other central nervous system infections in potential donors. It urged caution in accepting organs from donors with an untreated central nervous system infection.

The researchers want to improve awareness that rabies can be the cause of encephalitis, said co-author Dr. Sridhar Basavaraju, another CDC researcher. But he added, ‘We wouldn't want to mandate any screening that would potentially exclude transplantable organs.’

The study is based on a review of laboratory tests and medical records, and interviews with relatives of the organ donor and recipient. It provides the most detailed account of the chain of events that led to the two deaths and the investigation that followed, which prompted health authorities to recommend vaccines for dozens of people who were in contact with the donor or recipients.

The case attracted public attention 
because of the rare circumstances, including the long time between 
infection and death of the transplant recipient — about a year and a 
half.

It was just the third documented transmission of rabies through a solid organ transplant, the report says.

East Coast problem: As this 2010 map shows, rabies-infected raccoons are most common along the Eastern Seaboard. Small was likely infected during a hunting trip in Florida prior to his death in 2011

More widespread: Bats are another animal more likely than others to transmit rabies to humans and infected animals occur throughout the U.S.

Also, there are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the United States each year, and all but two domestic cases between 2000 and 2010 were linked to bats, according to the report. The authors say raccoons pose an under-recognized risk for infection and their spread into urban areas raises concern.

The patient who received the North Carolina donor's kidney at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. in September 2011 has not been publicly identified.

Investigators say they learned during subsequent interviews that Small trapped raccoons for use as bait during hunting-dog training exercises, and had been bitten at least twice by the animals, 18 months and seven months before developing symptoms. He was not treated for those bites.

‘If you don't ask specific questions, you don't get specific answers,’ said Dr. Michael Green, chairman of an advisory committee on disease transmission for the United Network for Organ Sharing.

‘At the time these questions are being asked initially, families are often traumatized, in shock,’ Green said. ‘They're losing a loved one. They may not be thinking normally or straight or remember all those details.’
