Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has drawn a line under the ongoing debate over whether the club did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at the club.

The Reds captain, whose move to the Los Angeles Galaxy this summer was confirmed on Wednesday, revealed earlier this week he would have signed a new contract had it been offered in pre-season.

Liverpool's offer of an extended deal did not arrive until November, by which time the 34-year-old was already considering his future, and that has prompted questions about the club's handling of the affair.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has poured cold water on suggestions the club didn't do enough to persuade their captain Steven Gerrard not to leave for LA Galaxy at the end of this season

Gerrard announced his decision to leave Liverpool this week and will join the Los Angeles Galaxy

'There is nothing any more to add,' said Rodgers. 'Everything has been said on that situation that needs to be said.

'Steven spoke very openly and honestly with his feelings on it. When you see all the interviews you will find it was dealt with.

'If you want to pick a few words out of what he said and elaborate... he is happy where it is at.

'His concentration is now on football, he has announced where he is going so you have all the information and he has done all his interviews.

'Now we really have to concentrate on the football and the team and keep the momentum going.'

Rodgers admits attention now has to be paid to finding players capable of succeeding such a club icon.

'There is no doubt Steven is still a top-class player and has been that world-class talent for many years and him leaving in the summer leaves a void on and off the pitch but the club has to keep moving forward.

'We have to keep looking to bring in the best players we can.

'History shows players who have been great players here move on and it is an opportunity for other players to grab the mantle.'

Raheem Sterling is expected to sign a new contract with Liverpool within the next month

Rodgers has high hopes for young forward Raheem Sterling, who is expected to sign an improved new contract within the next month which will reflect his growing importance to the side.

'Raheem has burst onto the scene and been outstanding and in one of the most competitive leagues in the world he has been on of the top-performing players,' he added.

'He still has a lot of years in his football education.'
