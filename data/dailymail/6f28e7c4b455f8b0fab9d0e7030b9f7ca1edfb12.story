Just days ago bookmakers dramatically slashed the odds of a white Christmas after flurries up and down the country.

But yesterday forecasters said that, far from shivering under a blanket of snow this weekend, we are likely to enjoy one of the mildest festive breaks on record.

A sudden switch in wind direction will cause warmer breezes to blow in from the tropics tomorrow night, the Met Office said.

After bookies took a run of bets on a white Christmas, are now betting on December 25 this year being the warmest since records began.

There are now odds of 1/9 that London will not see snow on December 25, while the price of the record Christmas temperature of 15.6C being beaten has been slashed from 25/1 to 12/1.

'The latest forecast suggests that a white Christmas is no longer on the cards and there is even a suggestion that we could see the hottest ever Christmas Day, which is 12/1,' said Hill's spokesman Rupert Adams.

However, bookmakers are still pricing snow in Aberdeen at 2-1.

And this could drive temperatures up as high as 14c (57f) in places.

It means temperatures in England will swing over the next few days from just above freezing to almost double the 7.4c (45f) average maximum for December. Even parts of Scotland will see temperatures of up to 12c (54f).

Though the mildest weather will be in the middle of the week, it is likely to remain warmer than usual in many areas until Christmas Day. The only snow will be on higher ground, while most of the country can expect sunny spells and showers.

It comes in stark contrast to last year, when Britain endured the coldest December in a century. A record low Christmas Day temperature for England of -15.9c (3f) was recorded last year in Shawbury, Shropshire, while Altnaharra in the Scottish Highlands set the UK record at -18.2c (-1f).

Making the most of it: Jacob Sargent and his grandmother Denise Sargent enjoyed the snow at Storey Arms in south Wales this week.

Forecaster Michael Lawrence said: 
‘This week will be much milder. By Wednesday, temperatures will be mild
 for the time of year and in low double figures generally – even minimum
 night-time temperatures will be higher than current daytime maximums.

‘Christmas Day’s weather pattern looks completely different to the set-up last year.

‘This Christmas, milder Atlantic air will bring brief settled and sunny interludes, with bands of rain in between.’

Although the next week will certainly 
be mild for the time of year, temperatures are not expected to top the 
record for the warmest Christmas Day of 15.6c (60f) set in Leith, near 
Edinburgh, in 1896 and matched in Killerton, Devon, in 1920.

Last week, bookmakers slashed this 
year’s white Christmas odds as short as 5/2 in Newcastle and 9/2 in 
London after snow coated the ground as far south as Exmoor in Devon and 
continued to sweep across parts of the north.

Before the warmer winds blow in tomorrow, the Met Office has issued an amber ‘be prepared’ weather warning for snow and ice over Tayside and the border region this morning.

During the weekend's big freeze, a 
mountain walker plunged 500ft to his death after a snow cornice he was 
walking along collapsed.

A woman who was with him on Y Garn, a 3,000ft peak in Snowdonia, fell 100ft but was rescued uninjured by a brave abseiler.

The tragedy happened after the walkers decided to cross a large cornice of overhanging snow which they thought was solid ground.

The snow gave way and caused an avalanche which killed the man. A third walker with them did not fall.

On Sunday in North Yorkshire,
a group of walkers who became stranded in freezing conditions had to be
saved by an RAF helicopter.

The six hikers were attempting to walk
between Fylingdales and Ravenscar when they fell into
difficulties at Juggers Ravine. 

A family
member alerted police at 6.50pm after receiving a phone call for help from one of the
walking party, who were all aged between 19 and 45.

The group was stranded in the ravine and two of their party, two women in their 40s, had
become unwell.

Due to the freezing temperatures, the walkers found themselves unable to
move and needed help.

A joint search and rescue operation was put into
action, including North Yorkshire Police, Scarborough and Ryedale Mountain
Rescue service and an RAF search and rescue helicopter. 

The walkers were
located and rescued by the helicopter team at 8.30pm. 

The two women were
taken to Scarborough General Hospital to be checked over but were found to be
uninjured.

The remaining walkers were transferred separately to join them. All six hikers were returned home safe and well.
