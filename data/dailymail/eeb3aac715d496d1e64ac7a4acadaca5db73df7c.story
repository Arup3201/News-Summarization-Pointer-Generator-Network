A letter from the head of a New York police union told officers they were facing a 'verified' threat by a militant prison group and warned cops Saturday to wear bulletproof vests and carry extra magazines.

An NYPD spokesperson stated there was not a 'credible, specific threat' after Sergeants Benevolent Association president Ed Mullins warned of an organized action to shoot an on-duty officer.

The New York Daily News reports Mullins sent the warning based on information that 10 members of the Black Guerrilla Family planned to shoot an NYPD officer.

'Please WEAR your VESTS and carry your firearm off-duty along with additional magazines,' a letter signed by Mullins read. 'Your priority is to go home at the end of your tour!'

The paper reports the threat was based on information gathered Friday by an undercover officer.

A spokesperson for the NYPD forwarded a statement from the department stating that the information was not a 'credible, specific threat' to NYPD officers.

'The threat information referenced in a recent news story relates to another East Coast City and does not make reference to New York City or its police,' the statement read.

'We continue to monitor and investigate any threat information as it surfaces. We will continue to advise all members of the service of any credible information relating to officer safety.' 

The Black Guerrilla Family is a militant prison group founded in 1966 at San Quentin State Prison that eventually developed a strong membership in Maryland as well.

The gang has a particularly large presence in the Baltimore City Detention Center, which investigators described as a Black Guerrilla Family 'stronghold.'

The Baltimore Sun describes how Tavon White, a leader within the prison, organized a drug smuggling operation within the prison with the help of corrections officers.

White, who relied on younger female officers, reportedly impregnated four prison guards, prosecutors working on the case say.
