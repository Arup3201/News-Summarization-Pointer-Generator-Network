A tasty royal wedding memento sold for $7,500 at auction on Friday, exceeding the auction house's expectations.

Julien's of Beverly Hills had predicted a slice of fruit cake from the eight-tier cake served at Prince William and Duchess Catherine's 2011 wedding ceremony would earn $2,000 at most.

The cake reportedly took 5 weeks to bake and was said to hit its peak flavor after 13 months, CNN Money reports.

Legacy: At the Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, a slice of cake from the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William, and Kate Middleton is on sale

It came with a blank wedding invitation printed on royal stationery.

Julien's executive director Martin Nolan said the auction house sold a piece of cake from the wedding of Princess Diana and Prince Charles a few years ago, which brought around $6,000.

The cake was 27 years old at the time. 

This auction included bidding on other royal items as well, as five of Princess Diana's dresses were set to be auctioned off. The dresses are expected to fetch $60,000 to $100,000 each. 

Kate and William's cake was a bespoke creation, crafted by cake-maker Fiona Cairns. It took her five weeks to complete the confectionery masterpiece.

The elaborate gateau was covered in cream and white icing and decorated with 900 delicate sugar-paste flowers. The culinary masterpiece took center stage at the Buckingham Palace reception held in the picture gallery on the day of their wedding.

Fiona, 59, whose confections are sold in Harrods, Selfridges and Waitrose, was contacted by St James's Palace in February and asked if she would make William and Kate's wedding cake.

Royal wedding memorabilia is extremely collectible and hard to get hold of, the Julien's auction will offer a rare opportunity to fans, pictured - Kate and Will on their wedding day in 2011

It appears that the humble slice of wedding cake may be worth its grand price tag as Fiona says that creating the dessert was a meticulous and exhausting task.  

'We reflected some of the architectural details in the room so the garlands on the walls were reproduced loosely on the fourth tier - we've used roses, acorns, ivy leaves, apple blossom and bridal rose.'

The bride wanted elements from the Joseph Lambeth technique of cake decoration, where intricate piping is used to make three dimensional scroll work, leaves, and flowers.

Kate also gave Fiona detailed instructions for her to include 17 different blooms and foliage for their meaning or symbolism - known as the 'language of flowers'.  

Also under the hammer is a blank invitation to the same wedding, printed on Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace stationary.

'The Lord Chamberlain is commanded by The Queen to invite __ to the Marriage of His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales, K.G. with Miss Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on Friday 29th April at 11.00 a.m.,' it reads. 'Dress: Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit.'
