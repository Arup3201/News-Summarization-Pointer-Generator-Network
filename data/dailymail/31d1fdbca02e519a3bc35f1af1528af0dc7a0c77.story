Rupert Everett has criticised today’s female pop stars because of their ‘elephant ankles’, ‘massive thighs’ and habit of selling sex.

In an interview in this weekend’s Event magazine, Everett, the star of films such as My Best Friend’s Wedding and Shakespeare In Love, calls Beyoncé an out-of-control egomaniac and dismisses Lady Gaga’s music as too conventional.

He says: ‘All these girls in pop, from Miley Cyrus to Beyoncé to Rihanna, overtly sell sex. They are practically naked in their videos.’

He adds: ‘Gaga is the most interesting of the lot of them; she does have true ideas, although her music is terribly conventional.’

Everett, 54, who is openly gay, says none of the stars matches his idea of feminine beauty.

‘I grew up with the idea of female beauty being delicate with long, slim legs.

Rupert Everett has been particularly scathing about Beyonce, left, saying she is an 'out-of-control' egomaniac. He also added that Lady Gaga, right, is interesting but her music is 'terribly conventional'

'Now it’s terribly “in” for women to have these huge great legs with massive thighs.’

The actor is particularly scathing about Beyoncé, who he says has ‘elephant ankles’.

He adds: ‘She and her husband Jay-Z live like a modern-day Greek god and goddess. It’s unbelievable.’
