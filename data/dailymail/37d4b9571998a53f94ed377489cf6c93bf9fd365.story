A last-ditch bid to get Marussia to the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend has fallen at the final hurdle.

Just under two weeks ago administrators working on behalf of the team confirmed the Banbury-based marque had ceased trading with the loss of 200 jobs.

Behind the scenes since then talks have been ongoing with a number of potential investors in the hope Marussia could at least take their place on the grid at the Yas Marina circuit.

A last-ditch bid to get Marussia to the final grand prix of the season in Abu Dhabi this weekend has failed 

Negotiations with one particular buyer appeared hopeful, to such an extent a contingency plan was put in place that would have resulted in the team flying out on Wednesday night.

In the paddock at the track, a handful of Ferrari engineers - given the team are powered by the famous Maranello marque - were spotted wearing Marussia kit.

It is also understood Williams and another financially-troubled team in Caterham were asked to move items out of garage space reserved for Marussia believing it would be vacant.

One insider told Press Association Sport: “The talks were serious enough, and a serious offer was made that led to the need to make preparations.

Marussia driver Max Chilton has finally broken his silence on his F1 team's demise 

“For the last 72 hours there has been very little sleep, with people talking all through the night.

“This morning it was serious enough that some action plans were put in place, and we were hoping to get over the line.

“Sadly, it hasn’t happened. By 5.30-6pm it was game over.”

Even if, by some miracle, the bid is resurrected overnight, it is now too late for Marussia to take part in the event that commences Friday with the two 90-minute practice sessions.

 The Britsh driver took to his Twitter account to express his disappointment 

The big question now is whether anything can be salvaged to aid the team’s cause for next season, albeit with a significant financial injection of at least £30million required.

It is understood administrator FRP Advisory are to issue a statement on Thursday clarifying the situation.

Breaking his silence for the first time since it was announced Marussia had gone out of business, via his Twitter feed driver Max Chilton said: 'Devastated for everyone involved at Marussia in the past 24 hours that the hard work trying to get to Abu Dhabi didn’t work out as we hoped.'
