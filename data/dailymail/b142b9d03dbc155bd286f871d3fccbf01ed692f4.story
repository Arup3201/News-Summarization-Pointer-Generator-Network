The Australian radio show behind the hoax call to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge was today permanently  taken off air - but the two presenters will be given other roles at the station.

Mel Greig and Michael Christian of 2Day FM in Sydney went into hiding and received death threats following the phone call last month to King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, central London.

Their Hot 30 show has been axed, but the presenters are still employed - and network Austereo is looking at them ‘returning to work when the time is right, in roles that make full use of their talents’.

Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate’s ward, was found dead in nurses’ housing three days later, prompting a huge backlash against Miss Greig and Mr Christian.

Austereo is today launching a new 
programme called The Bump, in place of Hot 30, which will be hosted by 
presenter Angus O'Loughlin, but Miss Greig and Mr Christian are still on
leave.

‘We look forward to
Mel and MC returning to work when the time is right, in roles that make
full use of their talents,’ Austereo chief executive Rhys Holleran told
Agence France-Presse.

He added that the network will discuss future roles with the presenters ‘when they are ready’.

Miss Greig and Mr Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in the call, which led Austereo to suspend prank calls by all of its radio stations and saw both presenters make a tearful apology on TV for their actions.

An investigation into the call by Australia's media watchdog is underway, and Scotland Yard has also launched a probe. But the pair are thought to be unlikely to face prosecution.

Ms Saldanha's grieving husband and two teenage children clutched each other last month as they gathered with hundreds of mourners in a small town in India for her funeral.

Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.'

The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'.

In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy.

Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life.

'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through.

And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.'

Mr Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected.

Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened.

'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.'

Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank.

They went into hiding after receiving threats while at least eight other senior staff members at the 2Day FM radio station and its parent company, SCAustereo, were also under protection of security guards.

One of the letters sent to Mr Christian was littered with foul language and is alleged to have warned him that there was a bullet with his name on it along with mentions of a shotgun.
