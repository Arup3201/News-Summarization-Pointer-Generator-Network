The last time Bostjan Cesar played against Wayne Rooney at Wembley he got a ‘stupid’ kick from the Manchester United striker which kept him out for five weeks.

The Slovenia captain returns today and will shake hands with the England captain on equal terms… although he admits ‘maybe I will squeeze his a little!’

During England’s 2009 friendly with Slovenia at Wembley, Cesar tangled with Rooney in the penalty area. Rooney won England a spot-kick, despite crashing heavily into Cesar’s ankle. Frank Lampard scored and England won 2-1, while the collision meant the end of Cesar’s night and a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

The defender later accused Rooney of intentionally trying to injure him, but five years on insists he is not seeking retribution.

‘I don’t understand the referee,’ he recalls. ‘He gives England a penalty and me a yellow card, but Rooney makes a stupid, stupid foul and leaves me injured for five weeks. I wasn’t happy but now everything is OK.

‘On the pitch I am very aggressive and I enjoy the fight in physical games, but I don’t want to kill him.’

Rooney, of course, becomes the newest member of England’s 100-cap club but Cesar is also celebrating a special milestone.

The 32-year-old former West Brom centre back plays his 81st game for his country, making him their most-capped player. And having played against England twice, he is convinced Slovenia can shock Roy Hodgson’s men and end up at Euro 2016 themselves.

‘The England team has changed a lot recently as there are lots of new players,’ he says. ‘These young players are very strong but when you change something it can sometimes become a problem.

‘This England team don’t have Frank Lampard, John Terry and Ashley Cole. I don’t think they are as strong as last time (a 1-0 win for England at the 2010 World Cup) and we might be able to take advantage of their inexperience.’

Slovenia, ranked 36 in the world, are second in Group E with six points from three games after beating Switzerland at home and Lithuania away — but Cesar refuses to get carried away.

‘We are hopeful of qualification,’ he says. ‘We have a very good team and this new format is really good for us, as more teams can qualify. The country is really optimistic after our last two wins and we’ll have a lot of fans at Wembley. There is more pressure on us now, but we are professionals and we like the pressure. When there is pressure we play well.’

Cesar is determined to help Slovenia register a first win over England, but it’s obvious he has a great affinity with this country.

Ever since he spent the 2007-08 season on loan at West Brom he has come back regularly to visit friends and oversee his business venture — the Fish in a Tie restaurant in Clapham, London. He even speaks about taking English lessons once again — ‘in case I manage West Brom one day!’

But it’s our football Cesar really loves and though he now plays for Italian side Chievo he acknowledges the superiority of the Premier League. He says: ‘It is the best in the world. I’m always dreaming of playing there again — but of course I am very happy in Italy.

‘Players give so much more than in other leagues. The strikers run harder, chasing every ball, and the supporters are fanatical.’

Indeed, if Cesar does turn his hand to management in the future, he has plenty of defining moments under his belt from which to draw experience.

He describes going to the 2010 World Cup as a ‘childhood dream’, and suspects his greatest individual moment might be his headed winner against eventual World Cup winners Italy in 2004 during qualification.

But when the idea of scoring the winner at Wembley today is floated his way he responds with a broad smile: ‘OK, maybe that would be the best moment’.
