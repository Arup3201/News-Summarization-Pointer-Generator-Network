Barcelona forward Neymar insists he is in no position to offer Luis Suarez advice as the former Liverpool striker continues to struggle in La Liga.

The Uruguayan has managed only two goals in 11 league appearances since completing a big-money move to the Catalans ahead of this season - and was was dropped from the starting line-up for the weekend's 6-0 defeat of Elche.

Despite also enduring a difficult debut season at the Nou Camp, Neymar does not feel it is his place to offer Suarez advice on how to cope with playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.

'Am I giving advice to Suarez? He's older and more experienced than I am. It is Suarez who should give advice to me...,' Neymar told Goal.com.

'Anyway, Luis helps the team with his goals, with passes, with everything. It is an honour to be playing in the same team as him.'

The Brazilian would not be completely drawn on Barca president Josep Bartomeu's comments that the club have the most feared forward line in world football.

'Are we the best attacking trident in the world? I don't know,' he added. 'But we do seem to be causing a lot of problems for opposing defences.'

Neymar has 19 goals in 24 appearances in all competitions this season after adapting to life in Spain.

Previously, head coach Luis Enrique had echoed Neymar's comments by saying he was sure Suarez would start to score more regularly and noted the 27-year-old made a valuable contribution with his movement off the ball and his tackling back.

'This is something that all forwards go through,' Luis Enrique told a news conference.

'It seems it's just not happening for him but he brings a lot to the team,' added the former Barca and Spain midfielder.

'It's about adaptation, there is no magic formula. He is integrated perfectly into the team and we are not worried.

'If I was worried I would tell you, but I am not. Would I like my strikers to score more goals? Of course!'
