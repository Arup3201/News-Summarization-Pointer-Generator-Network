Clearly aware of the risks involved in rock-climbing, Menna Pritchard has taken the precaution of kitting herself out with a safety helmet.

Incredibly, however, not only has she decided to scale the cliff with her two-year-old daughter Ffion strapped to her back – but she has also left the toddler’s head unprotected.

Clinging on as her mother smiles for a picture 30ft up, Ffion is exposed to serious injury should rocks fall from above or her mother lose her footing.

Adventurous: Menna Pritchard says that she hopes her outward bound experiences will inspire her daughter

Yesterday Miss Pritchard defended her
 actions, declaring: ‘Life is about taking risks.’ The 26-year-old 
student added that it was Ffion – held in a special carrier – who had 
encouraged her to continue the climb by saying: ‘Up Mummy, up.’

After posting the picture on her 
internet blog, she said: ‘Some people would say I’m taking more risks 
than are necessary, but I am very conscious of safety.’

She said she stopped half-way up the 
face because she ‘felt we’d gone far enough’, adding that the pair could
 not fall as her climbing partner on the ground was holding them secure 
with a rope.

She also said that a helmet was not 
necessary on the route and she wore hers only ‘out of habit’, a decision
 she now ‘regretted’ because of how it looks.

But other climbers said the limestone
 rock face at Three Cliffs Bay, on the Gower peninsula near Swansea, was
 notorious for breaking off and falling.

Risk-taker: 'Life is all about risks, whether that's something as simple as getting in your car every day or climbing up a rock face,' said Menna, who is studying outdoor education

Miss Pritchard, who lives in Wales 
with her parents since splitting from Ffion’s father, is studying for a 
degree in outdoor education.

She said: ‘The sue-and-blame culture 
means so many people are nervous, so afraid of getting into trouble, and
 taking small risks.’

A British Mountaineering Council 
guide warns parents to ‘be aware that climbing, hill walking and 
mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or 
death’.
