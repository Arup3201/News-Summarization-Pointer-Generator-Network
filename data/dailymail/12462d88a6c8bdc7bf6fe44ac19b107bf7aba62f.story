Consumers may be eager to get their hands on Samsung’s Galaxy S6 Edge with its curved screen. 

But a report hints that the South Korean firm is already working on its next-level displays for a fully foldable smartphone.

Unlike the curved models available now, such as the S6 Edge and LG’s Flex 2, Samsung's Galaxy S7 could be flexible and bendy.

A spokesman for Samsung Display told Business Korea: ‘The industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016.’ 

A number of the curved screens, including those created by LG and Samsung, use high molecular substance-based polyimide film.

This forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic.

The material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius, which in Semiconductor Energy Laboratroy's display is 0.7-inches (2mm).

Polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility. 

However, until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too, the dream of a roll-up smartphone will remain on the horizon.

It is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment, as bendy displays could have many uses, such as in smartbands and laptops, for example.

A spokesman from the industry said: ‘When flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops, which are substituted for publications, the concept of tiny portable PCs and e-books will be realised in reality.’ 

Rumours that Samsung was working on a bendable and virtually unbreakable version of its Galaxy handset first surfaced in 2012. 

The false rumour said that the handset, codenamed 'Project J' could be released in April 2013.

Last year, LG demonstrated a 5.9-inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged, at an exhibition in Tokyo.

The foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes (OLED).

It features touch sensors, meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures, and was demonstrated at the Display Innovation exhibition in Yokohama.

In July, LG unveiled an 18-inch screen that can be rolled up and it hopes to expand the technology to work with 60-inch displays in the future.

Earlier this month, Samsung revealed its next generation of Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S6 Edge, which features a curved 5.1 inch display.

On the S6 Edge, notifications appear on either the right or left-hand side, depending on which hand the owner uses.

Up to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge, and each contact is assigned a colour.

To access a contact, users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person. Conversely, swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time, weather or other customised notifications.

And when the phone is placed face down, the edge glows to show a phone call, text or email has been received. If these messages are from a saved contact, the edge will glow the relevant colour.

Plus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear 3D.

Both the 6 Edge and the Galaxy 6 have metal cases and are the first to feature dual-standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets.

People will need to pay extra for a Samsung non-slip wireless charger, but because it supports other standards both phones will work with any compatible charging dock. This image also shows the curvature of the phone's screen

David Kang, vice president of online at Samsung Mobile, told MailOnline: 'We've created not only what's next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones.'

'We believe consumers and business alike will be impressed by the design but equally they'll be taken by the power and performance.

'What we've accomplished is an elegant balance between design and technology.'

The S6 and S6 Edge will be available from 10 April in colours White Pearl, Black Sapphire. Gold Platinum and Blue Topaz. The S6 Edge will additionally be available in Green Emerald.
