He had pledged to treat the court with ‘respect.’

But BBC comedian Simon Brodkin was accused of doing exactly the opposite and making a mockery of the British justice system yesterday after his joking around landed him before a judge.

The former public schoolboy, who abandoned a medical career in favour of comedy six years ago, was hauled to court after a publicity stunt backfired last month.

Poking fun: Simon Brodkin leaving court in Liverpool with a glamorous Wag-style 'girlfriend' called Crystal

Dressed as footballer Jason Bent – a character from his BBC3 series in which he parodies the lives of pampered players – Brodkin managed to get on to the pitch and mingle with the Manchester City team shortly before their away game with Everton at Goodison Park.

To the bemusement of several professional players, including England’s Joe Hart and Gareth Barry, he jogged along the touchline and performed stretches, before being led away by police and arrested.

Earlier this week Brodkin, 35, from North London, said he would never have done the stunt – filmed to promote his new series – had he realised he would end up in court and pledged: ‘I have got to treat the court with the respect it deserves.’

But by the time he left court with a caution yesterday – and a warning from the judge to ‘reflect on the stupidity of his actions’ – he was back in character and joking about the case.

Brodkin appeared contrite in the dock yesterday at Liverpool Community Justice Centre, charged with going onto the playing area contrary to the Football Offences Act on March 16.

His solicitor Raymond Shaw told the court: ‘It was intended to be a humorous act. It is clear from the television footage that some of the players were amused but he didn’t know it was a criminal offence.

‘He expressed his remorse immediately when he was spoken to by the club and the police. He’s sorry and regrets his actions.’

District judge Ian Lomax agreed to the charge being withdrawn after hearing an ‘alternative course of action to prosecution’ had been found. Brodkin was given a conditional caution.

The BBC said he was not filming for the broadcaster on the day of the stunt. The judge told him to ‘regard himself somewhat fortunate’ and ‘reflect on the stupidity of his actions’.

Despite the  warning, Brodkin then got into character outside the court and delivered a statement as his footballer alter-ego.

He spiked up his highlighted hair into a shark-fin style, inserted two diamond studs into his ears and was joined by a blonde Wag-style ‘girlfriend’.

He thanked his supporters before reading a series of jokes in a Liverpool accent and unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘Why always Bent?’ – a reference to a similar stunt performed by Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli last season.

‘Thanks also to the judge, who was sat on the bench but unfortunately didn’t get a game,’ the comedian said. Asked if he was mocking the justice system, Brodkin, who was also banned from attending football matches until the end of the season, refused to comment.

Brodkin, a qualified doctor, relinquished his GMC registration in 2007 when his comedy career began to take off.
