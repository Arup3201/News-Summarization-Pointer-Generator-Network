Her unnatural tan shocked the world as much as the allegations that she took her five-year-old daughter into a sunbed booth, but new photos has revealed what 'tanning mom' looked like before she bombarded her skin with ultraviolet rays.

In a series of monochrome shots taken in her twenties, Patricia Krentcil has a fresh-faced appearance and a smooth, clear complexion.

The cleavage-baring swimwear photos are thought to have been snapped as she tried to break into the world of glamour modelling.

The shots serve as evidence of how the 44-year-old's excessive tanning habit has affected her skin over the past two decades.

It even appears that her face is a 
few shades lighter than her body - a stark contrast to the deep tan she 
sports now years over twenty later.

The New Jersey woman is dubbed 'tanning mom' for allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter to a tanning salon.

Krentcil, who became the target of 
public ridicule for her unnatural complexion and wild media appearances,
was due in state Superior Court yesterday.

But the hearing was cancelled, because
the Essex County Prosecutor's office referred the case to a New Jersey 
grand jury instead.

She is believed to pay $99 a month for unlimited access to the sunbed booths.

Today she was pictured in a car outside her home today holding the $29.95 'Tanorexic' mom doll.

Krentcil told New York’s Daily News 
that some days she tans more than others likening her extreme tanning 
habit to drinking coffee: 'Do you drink coffee? Some days you don’t. 
Same thing.'

The saga began when the teacher of 
Krentcil's fair-skinned, red-haired daughter Anna noticed serious burns 
on the 5-year-old's body.

However, Krentcil has always denied that she took Anna into a booth.

'I would never, ever put my daughter in a tanning booth,' she told a TMZ reporter.

'Any mother who makes an accusation about me is not a mother because I’m a great mother - I would never do that to my child.'

Pictures emerged on earlier this month of Anna,
along with her brother Addison, in the arms of their father Rich 
Krentcil at their Nutley, New Jersey home.

In court: Patricia Krentcil appeared at her arraignment last month because she was charged with child endangerment for allegedly taking her 5-year-old daughter tanning

Mr
Krentcil, a 47-year-old trader, stood up for his wife in spite of the 
fact that neighbors have said she went tanning while pregnant with Anna.

'They’re making her out to be a monster,' he told The Daily News. 'She just likes it. She’s not a crazy maniac where she has to tan every day.'

Krentcil
said that while she did take her daughter Anna to the tanning salon, 
the little girl never got in the booth and was only there waiting for 
her mother to finish her session.

She argues that Anna got her sunburn 
from playing in the yard and not breaking the law. Doctors say tanning 
booths, which emit UV radiation, are known carcinogens.

Krentcil's daughter apparently received enough of the radiation to burn her skin and leave her with painful damage, police say.

Her attorney, John Caruso, disagrees,
as he said that Krentcil will be exonerated, because the evidence will 
show the child never entered the booth.

'Forget
about the presumption of innocence; my client is 150 per cent innocent,'
Caruso said. 'She loves that child more than her whole life. She would 
never, ever allow her child to go inside a tanning bed.'

The child is still living at home 
with her mother, Caruso told Municipal Court Judge Roslyn Holmes-Grant, 
though he said the state's child welfare agency is monitoring the 
family.

Krentcil said she loves tanning and 
has visited salons for many years but would not do anything to 
jeopardize her daughter's health.

'Never in my life would I endanger my
child by putting her in a tanning booth. I'm not dumb,' she said before
her scheduled hearing. Outside court, she called herself 'a wonderful 
mother.'

The Bergen County Record
reports that employees the tanning salon in Nutley, New Jersey, didn't 
realize Krentcil had brought her daughter into the stand-up tanning 
booth.

State law prohibits children under 14 from using tanning booths. Anyone under 18 must have parental permission.

The
incident was reported when a teacher at Anna's school overheard Anna 
telling a friend that she went to the tanning salon with her mom, and 
then the teacher pieced that together with Anna's noticeable sunburn.

'I tan, she doesn't tan,' Krentcil said, stating the obvious.

With
her skin reminiscent of the outlandish character Magda from the 1998 
comedy There's Something About Mary, it is very clear that Krentcil has 
been to more than one tanning session in her time.

Even
given the timing of her mugshot - taken on April 24 - and her Today Show 
interview - which aired on May 2 - the difference in her skin tone makes 
it clear that her legal scuffle didn't stop her from making a stop at 
the tanning salon in the meantime.

Krentcil says her daughter did not break any
laws by going in the room with her but not in the actual tanning booth.
'It's called a tanning booth and a tanning room,' she said.

The legal situation has taken a toll on both Krentcil and Anna. 'It's traumatizing for a little girl who did nothing wrong but got a little sunburn,' Krentcil told Today.

Police arrested Krentcil on April 24. She took the child to the tanning salon the week before, authorities say.

The charge was upgraded to a felony and Krentcil was released after posting $25,000 bail.

Dr
Stephanie Badalamenti, a dermatologist, told the station tanning booths
can increase the risk of developing melanoma, a deadly form of skin 
cancer, by 75 percent.

'This can be very dangerous,' she said. 'This can be a life-changer.'
