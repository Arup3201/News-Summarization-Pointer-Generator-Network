This dramatic footage captured by police officers on the beat arresting criminals and helping victims was today released, as Scotland Yard begins the world's biggest trial of uniform-mounted cameras.

But privacy groups today raised concerns over how recordings made on the cameras will be handled, whether people will know they are being filmed - and if they will be able to access their own copy.

The trial will see 500 cameras distributed to ten London boroughs. Firearms officers will also be testing the cameras in training with a view to wearing them if the pilot is successful.

It follows criticism of the force following the death 29-year-old Mark Duggan at the hands of armed officers, which sparked the 2011 riots in the capital and further afield.

Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the cameras would result in speedier justice for victims, particularly in cases of domestic violence.

Hands up: In another video, an officer says 'the camera's rolling' while a man sits on the floor of a bedroom

Confession: The man says: 'I robbed him and he didn't give me what I want, so I stabbed him before I left'

Police presence: The man is arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, and handcuffed

He said: ‘Body-worn video will not only help us fight crime and support victims but help the Met to be more accountable.

'Our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident'

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police commissioner

‘Our experience of using cameras already shows that people are more likely to plead guilty when they know we have captured the incident. 

‘That speeds up justice, puts offenders behind bars more quickly and protects potential victims. Video captures events in a way that can't be represented on paper in the same detail.

‘And it has been shown the mere presence of this type of video can often defuse potentially violent situations without the need for force to be used.

‘I believe it will also show our officers at their best, dealing with difficult and dangerous situations every day but it will also provide clearer evidence when it's been alleged that we got things wrong. That has to be in both our own and the public's interest.’

Controversial incident: The Met wants to repair the damage to its relationship with the community caused by the shooting of Mark Duggan (pictured)

The debate over the more widespread use of body-worn cameras by British police comes after a jury at the inquest into Duggan's death concluded in January that he had been lawfully killed after being shot dead by Met marksmen - a conclusion which prompted outrage from his family and supporters.

None of the officers involved in the incident in London were wearing body cameras.

The
 Met has continued its efforts to attempt to repair the damage to its 
relationship with the community caused by the controversial shooting.

Speaking
 ahead of the pilot, the Met said officers taking part in the pilot must
 comply with guidelines about when cameras are to be used, but that they
 will not be permanently switched on.

Camden Borough is the first to take 
delivery of the new cameras, from today, with further trials in Barnet, 
Bexley, Bromley, Brent, Croydon, Ealing, Havering, Hillingdon and 
Lewisham.

Officers will store material from each incident and keep it on file for a month unless required for evidence purposes. Sir Bernard said the cameras could have helped in the Duggan case.

He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I think as we saw in the recent incident - fairly recent incident - regarding Mark Duggan, there was a great dispute about what Mark Duggan was holding at the time he was shot, and this hopefully would have helped to resolve that.’

Praise: The cameras have been welcomed by former shadow home secretary David Davis (pictured), who said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy ever taking place

If officers are found to regularly fail to switch on their cameras when they should do it will be treated as a disciplinary offence, he added. Sir Bernard said the cameras would ‘capture the reality of some of the horrible things we have to deal with from time to time’.

Civil liberties campaigners may observe some irony in the launch of body cameras for police.

That is because officers have previously used anti-terrorism laws to stop the public taking pictures of them, which is actually legal.

Police were warned against using the Counter-Terrorism Act five years ago to stop people taking pictures of officers.

Lord Carlile said in a review of anti-terror laws in 2009 that officers who force photographers to delete images could face prosecution.

Section 58A of the Counter-Terrorism Act came into force that year, banning photography of police that could be useful to terrorists. The maximum sentence is ten years in jail.

Campaigners warned at the time that it could stop the media recording protests or evidence of heavy-handed policing.

Big Brother Watch said today that nobody 'should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves'.

The privacy group did add that the cameras could improve accountability of the police, but only if they are ‘implemented properly, particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way’.

However, the cameras found a strong supporter in the face of former shadow home secretary David Davis.

The staunch libertarian said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy two years ago ever taking place.

Mr Davis said: 'Had it been recorded then the dispute wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be arguing about who said what.'

The cameras have also been welcomed by former shadow home secretary David Davis, who said their use would have avoided the Plebgate controversy ever taking place.

He told The Guardian: 'If there's a disputed event between the police and public there should be video evidence available.

‘And if it's not there then there will be an assumption that it's not been provided, that the police are culpable.

'Plebgate is the obvious case. Had it been recorded then the dispute wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be arguing about who said what.'

The Plebgate affair happened in 2012 when former chief whip Andrew Mitchell was told by police officers that he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of Downing Street.

Exactly what happened next is still a matter of legal dispute, with 58-year-old Mr Mitchell admitting to have sworn - but, crucially, denying ever calling officers ‘plebs’.

Pc Keith Wallis, 53, a Scotland Yard diplomatic protection officer, was jailed for one year in February after he admitted lying about witnessing the row that ultimately led to the resignation of Mr Mitchell.

Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, told MailOnline today: ‘No member of the public should be subjected to this sort of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place and how they can access a copy for themselves.

‘There have been too many instances in the past where officers have prevented members of the public from filming incidents involving the police, citing nonsense claims that it is illegal for them to do so. If the police want to gain public support for body worn cameras, then the right to film must work both ways.

‘However, if these cameras are implemented properly, particularly with regard to whether officers are able to access the memory cards or tamper with the footage in another way, there is potential for this to improve accountability of the police.

‘That is not to say that they do not risk also damaging the relationship between the police and the public, and the potential for abuse is clear, but if properly regulated, they can improve protection for both police officers and members of the public.’
