We are more accustomed to seeing her oozing glamour on the red carpet but in her latest shoot Nicole Kidman proves her worth as a versatile model too.

The Academy Award-winning actress is the star of the Jimmy Choo Pre-Fall 2014 campaign, her fourth for the luxury footwear brand.

Wearing nothing but a tailored white blazer (and Jimmy Choos, of course), the 46-year-old shows off her seemingly endless legs in a preview of the campaign that will be released in May.

Rock chic: Nicole Kidman has returned for her fourth campaign for luxury footwear brand Jimmy Choo

In the slick imagery, Nicole channels the collection’s mood for a more 'rebellious aesthetic'.

Nicole models the brand's Marlin boot, a £650 flat pointy toe offering with side buckle detail and printed panel, lending a touch of rock chic that is complemented by a tousled blonde mane reminiscent of Brit boho babe Sienna Miller.

With one hand placed seductively on her hip she also clutches a £2,495 slouchy, python Anna bag by the brand in the picture shot by Willy Vanderperre.

Speaking about the campaign, which will be unveiled globally in May, Sandra Choi, Creative Director, said: 'Nicole embodies the tougher attitude and rebellious glamour that is key to the Pre-Fall collection’s aesthetic.

'She’s a true chameleon in how she 
transforms herself each season creating such strong imagery. She looks 
effortlessly alluring in the campaign which really makes the product 
shine.'

Speaking about her 
latest gig, Nicole said: 'I really enjoyed working with Willy, he gave 
me such great direction, it was like being on a film set.

'It
 was fun to embrace a more rebellious spirit for Jimmy Choo; we listened
 to a lot of great rock music to get in the mood for the shoot.'

It's been a busy few weeks for Nicole Kidman, who has swapped the bright lights of Los Angeles for
 the small Australian town of Canowindra for a new movie project.

Canowindra's
 2,000 strong population are throwing themselves into a frenzy, as 
Kidman prepares to shoot scenes there for the upcoming Australian indie 
thriller Strangerland.

The 
actress arrived in Sydney last week with her two daughters 
and will soon venture out to the small New South Wales township.

The film follows a couple, played by 
Kidman and Joseph Fiennes, whose teenage children go missing, and will 
be shot in Sydney, Broken hill as well as Canowindra.

Kidman has said of the film: 'I am always looking for the right script to bring me home to Australia.

'The moment I read Strangerland I knew this was a film I couldn't say no to.'

According to the Daily Telegraph,
 an extras casting call was held in Canowindra several weeks ago, which 
attracted over 400 people - approximately one fifth of the town's 
population.

Last week Kidman attended the 
funeral of L'Wren Scott in Los Angeles, and also made several 
promotional appearances for her latest film, The Railway Man.
