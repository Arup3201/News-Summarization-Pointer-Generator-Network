The lover and gardener of British expatriate Patricia Wilson, who was reported missing from her French home last month, has allegedly confessed to killing her and hiding her body in a thicket close to a pond.

Jean-Louis Cayrou was charged with Miss Wilson’s murder and remanded in custody shortly after she vanished.

He has repeatedly denied any involvement in the 58-year old’s disappearance, remaining ‘walled in silence’, according to a police source.

But a fellow inmate of Cayrou, 50, phoned prosecutors from inside the prison in which they were both being held – claiming that he had admitted his guilt to him. He told them: ‘Cayrou said they’d had a fight. He hit her and then realised she was dead. He panicked and hid the body in a thicket close to a pond.’

Police took the claim seriously as the inmate had risked imminent freedom by getting in touch. He had called on an illicit mobile on the eve of his release from a long sentence. After the call, officers began an intensive search close to the £250,000 stone cottage north of Toulouse that was renovated by former advertising executive Miss Wilson and her partner Donald Marcus on their arrival five years ago.

Mr Marcus, 54, returned to the UK about a year ago for medical treatment – apparently disillusioned with life in rural France.

Police say Cayrou and Miss Wilson began a relationship in April but split in July. Curious neighbours of Miss Wilson in the Aveyron village of Vabre-Tizac were told that the new search was simply part of the ongoing investigation, which had been scaled down to a handful of officers aided by forensic specialists.

After the inmate’s revelations, Cayrou was secretly taken back to the cottage, along with the trial judge, so that clothing and other items could be removed from the scene in his presence.

However, police are now privately admitting that unless Cayrou, their only suspect, confesses and leads them to the spot, Miss Wilson’s body may never be found.

A police source said: ‘We are searching for a needle in a haystack in a vast rural territory – woods, dense forests plunging to the gorges of the Viaur, dozens of lakes, ponds, even abandoned houses, all perfect for hiding a body. The only person who can lead us to her is her killer.’

All evidence appears to point to the tall, semi-itinerant odd-job man and gardener as the killer. Even his lawyer, Sylvie Bros, agrees that police do not seem to be looking at any other leads.

Police say friends told them that the relationship between Cayrou and Miss Wilson was tumultuous and stormy, with many arguments and fights.

Shortly after they got together, she allowed him to move in with her from the caravan he inhabited several miles away. But she threw him out six weeks later and, according to friends and police, he began a campaign of harassment. On one occasion, it is alleged, he broke into her cottage to prove she wasn’t safe alone.

Yet other expats in the 500-strong village, and friends and family of the shy, quietly reclusive Cayrou, do not believe he is a killer. A relative said: ‘We’re a large, extended family and, unlike most French, don’t have constant contact. Jean-Louis was always a bit of a hippy. We know little of his life but we do know he was gentle and kind – and never cruel. We thought of him as a good man.’

Other expats who employed him as an odd-job man also spoke of his kindness and quiet ability.

But police believe that he attacked Miss Wilson on the steps of her cottage and dragged her down to his car. Blood and DNA in his Renault saloon matched Miss Wilson’s – and forensic officers found her DNA on other items inside the car.

Traces on his mobile phone also put Cayrou close to the house at the time she is said to have disappeared.

Prosecutors say Cayrou will not face a court before next year at the earliest.
