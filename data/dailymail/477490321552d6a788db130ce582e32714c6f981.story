An armed robber who terrorised businesses across Stockport, striking 19 times in just two weeks, has been jailed.

In one  incident Peter Thomas, cigarette in mouth, casually pretended to buy a bag of crisps at a convenience store in the Offerton suburb of Stockport, Greater Manchester.

He then pulled out his gun and pointed it at a terrified teenage girl shop assistant. The 27 year-old then helped himself to cash from the till before escaping.

This was one of 13 robberies, five attempted robberies and a burglary which the serial crook committed in two weeks, mostly in the Stockport area.

After his shop was raided, Doug Gill, 62, was determined that Thomas would not get away with it.

The store owner was able to hand over clear CCTV footage of the crook raiding his shop to police, who arrested Thomas  after the image was published in a local newspaper.

 He has now been given a 12-year sentence at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester.

Doug said: 'That is a good result. I was annoyed and upset that he pulled a gun on a nice young girl. She is remarkable and has dealt with it well.

'I thought I had the CCTV and if I could get it out there we could get this man brought to justice.

'We are always on guard for this sort of thing and never fully relax.'

Thomas, from Cheadle Hulme, admitted one count of robbery, with the other offences, plus another three of possessing an imitation firearm, taken into consideration. He must serve eight years, with four on licence.

Businesses he targeted included branches of Subway, William Hill bookmakers, the Co-op and Bargain Booze.

All took place between August 16 and 31 this year, with some involving a gun or a note claiming he had a gun.

Police said on the majority of occasions, the offender calmly queued up and when he has reached the till, produced a handwritten note claiming he had a gun. He then threatened he would use the weapon unless the cashier handed over money.

No-one was physically injured during the robberies although staff at the stores have been badly shaken up.
