The driver of the truck Kerry Kennedy crashed into on Friday said she was either asleep at the wheel or intoxicated as he saw her 'nod off' seconds before his horn gave a warning blast.

Rocco Scuitello, 47, from the Bronx area of New York, spoke about the accident and recalled how RFK's daughter's was driving erratically for more than three miles on the Westchester highway before the Lexus slammed into his rig and careered off the interstate.

He told the New York Post: 'My first impression was that she was really, really drunk. She's very lucky she didn't kill somebody.

'I’ve been a truck driver for 22 years. I’m pretty sure she was half-asleep or very, very intoxicated.

'She scared the heck out of a lot of people. She was completely out of it.'

He told the Post that right before the crash, he saw Kennedy's head drop down to the steering wheel before snapping up again and nodding off again, all while veering in and out of lanes.

'She started 
coming at me, like she didn’t see me. She was starting to nod off,
her head was bobbing toward the steering wheel,' he said.

'I hit the horn. I couldn’t go back into
the breakdown lane because there was a disabled truck up ahead. I could
either hit that truck or let her do whatever she was going to do.

'I hit the brakes, but she hit the brakes at the same time and veered right into me.

'When she hit me, my left tire tore up 
her passenger-side door. She woke up a little bit, not a lot — not the way you’d wake up if you’d just hit a 6,000-pound truck.'

Arrested: Kerry Kennedy has been charged with driving while impaired with drugs in New York

Kennedy, ex-wife of Governor Cuomo, was found by police slumped over her wheel of her 2008 silver-white Lexus RX 350 at one of the exits of the highway and charged with driving while ability  impaired by drugs. 

One of the tires on her car came free and shot into oncoming traffic and smoke was pouring out of the Lexus, the truck driver said.

Mr Scuitello told the Post he first thought she must be 'really, really 
drunk' and recalled when he saw her she looked like she had just rolled 
out of bed.

Kennedy told officers she had taken the sleeping drug Ambien before getting behind the wheel that morning.

Kennedy gave blood and urine samples at a nearby police barracks, results are pending.

She is expected to plead not guilty at a hearing in North Castle court tonight.

On Sunday, one of Kennedy's family claimed she had had a seizure behind the wheel, which caused her to crash.

They said she may be suffering from an undiagnosed medical condition which led her to black out at the wheel as she has no recollection of the collision.

‘She does not remember how she got to
the side of the road. All she remembers is feeling very woozy, and then
the cops were there,’ the source told the paper.

‘They think she may have had some sort of seizure.’

Friday's collision came just two months
after her best friend and sister-in-law Mary committed suicide after 
struggling with alcoholism and drug abuse.

Ms Kennedy, 52, crashed into the big rig 
about 8am om Friday then drove off the highway. The collision damaged 
her car and left it with a flat tire.

Police arrived at the scene after a 911 call reported erratic driving on the freeway.

They then discovered Ms Kennedy passed out at the wheel of the white 2008 Lexus RS 350. There were no passengers.

She
apparently told police that she had taken prescription sleeping pills -
said to include the drug Ambien - before the accident, according to WABC.

A spokesman for Ms Kennedy denied that she was under the influence.

Ken Sunshine told the New York Times: 'Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests – all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system.

'The charges were filed before the test results were available.'

If Ms Kennedy is found to have been under the influence of Ambien, she could have a legal basis for combating the driving under the influence charge.

Driving while intoxicated? Ms Kennedy says she had taken the sleeping pill Ambien, which has been known in rare cases to cause 'sleep-driving'

The 'Ambien defense' is a relatively new strategy that has been successfully used to clear drivers who had taken the medication before being arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

Doctors have recorded rare cases of the drug causing people to eat, walk and even get behind the wheel of a car while under the effects of the popular sedative. In those cases, the patients claimed to have no memory of their actions. As a result, courts have found they are not criminally liable for their actions.

However, most successful uses of the defense argument have come in cases where the defendants were found during normal sleeping times and often when they were discovered wearing pajamas.

Ms Kennedy, one of the most prominent members of the legendary Kennedy family, is the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the niece of President John F. Kennedy.

Celebration: Ms Kennedy with Mr Cuomo during his first New York gubernatorial campaign in 2002

Her father was Senator for New York then U.S. Attorney General before being assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign.

She re-entered the public eye as the wife of Mr Cuomo, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet who was elected as Governor of New York in 2010.

The couple have three children but divorced in 2005 after 13 years of marriage.

Ms Kennedy was best friends with her sister-in-law Mary Richardson Kennedy, who killed herself at her New York home in May after her marriage to Robert F. Kennedy Jr disintegrated.

Kerry delivered an emotional eulogy at Mary's funeral, describing her friend as an 'angel' who had been destroyed by her own 'forces of evil'.
