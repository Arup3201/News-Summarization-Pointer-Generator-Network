A crazed knifeman was shot up to four times by armed police officers after Taser stun guns failed to incapacitate him.

The man, aged in his 20s, was fighting for his life in hospital last night after receiving  multiple gunshot wounds.

He was injured as he brandished a large knife or sword at a group of officers.

The scene in Forest Hill, south London, where a man was shot by police

Witnesses said they heard police screaming orders at the knifeman during the stand-off in Forest Hill, South East London.

One 45-year-old man said: 'There was 
some shouting then two shots, then some more shouting, another shot, 
then more shouting and a fourth shot.

'I
had just got up to make a cup of tea when I first heard the shouting. 
It was the police shouting - like they do on the telly when they raid a 
house.

'The police were shouting "Get on the floor! Put it down! Put it down! Get on the floor!"

'I don't know who it was who was involved. I didn't look out of the window because I didn't want to get shot too.'

The shooting took place shortly before 6am yesterday morning after residents dialled 999 to report a suspected car thief.

Local officers were the first to 
arrive at the scene but they  were forced to retreat and  call in armed 
colleagues when the man threatened them with a weapon.

Police followed the man and another 
confrontation took place in a neighbouring street, during which a 
50,000-volt stun gun was discharged and shots fired.

The injured man, who is originally from Ghana, was taken by ambulance to King’s College Hospital in South London.

The shooting is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

It was the first police shooting in 
London since the death of suspected gangster Mark Duggan last August, 
which triggered rioting across the country.

Another resident said her young son was woken up by the disturbance and she thought gang members were fighting in the street.

The Asian woman said: 'My son came running out of his bedroom saying "I can't sleep - I heard bombs."

Police were called to reports of a man trying to break into a car in Elsinore Road. When they approached him he threatened them

'I told him it was builders and to go back to bed, but I knew it was gunshots. I heard them as clear as day.

'A couple of minutes later I heard screaming and I went to the window and the place was just swarming with police.

'They were everywhere. There were loads of riot vans and just police as far as you could see in the dark.'

Police set up a large cordon around the scene of shooting. A car with a smashed windscreen could be seen inside. Several knives were found.

Mike Franklin, of the IPCC, said: 'Our investigation will be carried out by our own investigators and will look at the circumstances leading up to this shooting.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Every year the Met deploys armed officers to over 3,000 incidents and plans over 700 armed operations in order to protect the public from dangerous offenders.

'In that context, shots are fired very rarely by officers when they see no alternative and only in one or two of those operations each year.'
