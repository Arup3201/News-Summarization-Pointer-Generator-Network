It took Cristiano Ronaldo 52 seconds to confirm his World Cup well-being as Portugal signed off for the finals on a comprehensive note in the MetLife Stadium against a ragged Republic of Ireland.

Out of action since the Champions League final, Ronaldo ripped through the Irish defence with his first touch to spear a shot on target. The message was clear – CR7 was back.

In front of Roy Keane, his former Manchester United comrade, Ronaldo smacked the post, made an assist, and twice went close from open play as he showed enough of his repertoire to indicate he will carry a serious threat in Brazil.

The 29-year-old World Player of the Year also shipped a couple of hefty Irish challenges which certainly tested his fitness after knee and thigh problems.

Wisely, Portuguese coach Paolo Bento withdrew Ronaldo just after an hour on a newly-laid surface that was a slow, spongy, and a hazard throughout.

'Yes, it was important that he played and we would not hide it,' Bento said afterwards. 'A player like Ronaldo is important for any team, and that's the case for us. It's good that he is back.'

Too often, players lost their footing and it was a blessing that no one picked up an injury.

Twenty years after their World Cup win over Italy in the old Giants Stadium, the Irish were cut down to size as they slipped to their most comprehensive defeat under Martin O’Neill.

But for the first half heroics of David Forde in the goal, the margin of defeat would have been greater for a team which played, at times, as if the summer break was on their minds.

After a lusty rendition of ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ sung by Uncle Junior from The Sopranos, the Portuguese fans had reason to cheer Ronaldo’s early surge, and an early goal.

It came inside the third minute when Ireland lost possession – this became a worrying trend – and Silvestre Varela crossed from the right for the unmarked Hugo Almeida to head home.

After a double save from Forde to deny
 Ronaldo and Raul Meireles, who also returned after injury, Portugal 
doubled their advantage when Richard Keogh deflected Fabio Coentrao’s 
left-wing delivery beyond Forde into the top corner.

Captain fantastic: Ronaldo's return marked a major improvement in Portugal's attacking play

The
 one-sided nature of play continued when Ronaldo struck the butt of the 
upright before the Real Madrid star found the target with a header which
 bounced off Forde into the path of Almeida, who snapped up his second 
goal of the night.

There 
were few positives for O’Neill, who sprang a surprise by leaving out 
Robbie Keane from the starting XI and giving Jon Walters the armband and
 the lone ranger role in attack.

It
 was only the second time in 13 years that Keane didn’t start when fit –
 the last occasion was for a friendly against Georgia 12 months ago.

O’Neill
 says he knows what Keane can do but the omission of Ireland’s record 
goal scorer and most capped player is a perhaps a clue to O’Neill’s 
thoughts for the Euro 2016 qualiifers.

Keane will be 34 next month and needs to be used sparingly for the campaign.

He
 was missed as the Irish lacked bite in the final third, 
although things improved after the break when James McClean grabbed a 
consolation goal from a quickly taken free-kick in the 52nd minute. It 
was McClean’s first goal on his 23rd appearance.

While
 Wes Hoolahan grafted in midfield and Keogh’s bravery was without question, 
the Irish conceded two more goals after a raft of substitutions late on through Vierinha and Coentrao 
as O’Neill was left to reflect on a worrying run of six games without a 
win.

'I thought we started nervously, and that was something we wanted to try and avoid,' O'Neill reflected.

'Two of their goals came from our possession, which we gave away needlessly.

'Those are the things that over the course of the European championships you have to try and cut out. I thought we came to grips with it - we got the goal back and looked dangerous at times.

'We were still trying to chase it to get back to 3-2. When I finally sit down and analyse it, there should be things I am happy about and obviously things we need to improve.

'I feel it is not disheartening in the sense that it was 3-1 and if we shut up shop, it is 3-1 and it doesn't seem so bad.

'I am not too bothered. I have done this before at club level, trying to chase games and stay as positive as possible, and considering the changes that we made and some of our main players not playing, I don't think this will kill us off.'
