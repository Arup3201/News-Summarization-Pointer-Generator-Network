A 28-year-old blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a bus driver laughed in her face and refused to believe she qualified for a disabled fare.

Megan Johnston, from Newtown, Wellington, in New Zealand, has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision.

Megan uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision and when she boarded the bus on Wednesday afternoon she had folded the stick under her arm.

‘When the bus pulled up I went to get on after a few people and, like I usually do, I folded up my cane and showed the driver my card,’ Megan told Daily Mail Australia.

The bus pass, issued by NZ Bus, clearly states ‘blind person’ on it. ‘It just gets me a dollar off my fare which I thought I may as well use,’ Megan said.

As she handed over her $2 fare the driver refused to take her money as she explained the pass simply gets her a concession fare.

‘He said “yeah but you are not blind are you?” and started laughing,’ Megan said.

‘I said “are you kidding me” and he said “well how did you get on the bus, you can obviously see things”,’ she recalled.

Megan’s hereditary condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, means her eyesight is approximately 170 degrees worse than a person with perfect eyesight and leaves her with no peripheral vision.

Shocked by his assumption that she was lying about being blind, Megan told the bus driver she has ‘five per cent vision’ and he responded: ‘That’s not actually blind is it.’

‘I was really shocked. I took my money and got off the bus… I should be able to get on the bus without being questioned,’ Megan said.

‘I was just devastated. I was on my way into town to meet a friend and it’s taken a long time for me to be confident using my cane and be not judged.’

Upset and in tears, Megan fired off a message on Twitter to the bus company and was told to call their generic customer service line.

‘I said “hey your bus driver just laughed at me and said I wasn’t blind despite having a cane and a card”. They gave me the general Metlink number .’

When Megan rang the company in tears she was told they would get back to her in two to three weeks.

Since her story was first published in the Dominion Post, the Go Wellington bus company has been in touch to apologise.

Retinitis Pigmentosa is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness.

It dramatically effects peripheral vision and is often described as extreme tunnel vision. 

The degeneration is progressive and has no known cure. 

But Megan believes there needs to be more awareness around the fact there are varying degrees of blindness.

‘I am constantly confronted by people who think blindness is black and white. But there is a big variation,’ Megan explained.

Megan has had her cane for around a year and a half and it isn’t known at what rate, or if, her eyesight will continue to deteriorate.

‘I haven’t been on a bus since then and I definitely don’t feel comfortable. I also have a card for half price taxi fares so I feel more comfortable using that now,’ she said.

Since becoming legally blind Megan, a talented artist and designer, has battled with not only her difficulty in seeing what’s around her but also people’s perceptions of her disability.

‘I’ve always had artistic tendencies but people find it hard to deal with because it’s such a visual thing.

It took her a long time before she began feeling confident enough to use her cane (pictured) in public 

‘The fact of the matter is I do have intact middle vision and it’s there and fine and it’s more than I need to draw illustrations. It also means I can work from home and don’t have to go out,’ she said.

Megan inherited her Retinitis Pigmentosa, which cannot be cured, from her father and is considered legally blind.

In an article she wrote for the website On The Left, Megan described how ‘getting around in public became increasingly hard a few years ago’.

‘I was constantly getting in people’s way. People were in a hurry and were huffing and puffing and occasionally swearing at me. They weren’t to know, but it made me feel horrible. If I bumped into just one person, it would rattle me and ruin my entire day,’ she wrote.

The illustrator reasoned: ‘Blindness comes in many, many forms and just because we can’t see one thing, it doesn’t mean we can’t see another.’
