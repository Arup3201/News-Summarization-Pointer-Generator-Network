Convicted: Stuart Worvell was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter at Cardiff Crown Court today

A 22-year-old man was today jailed for 12 years for stabbing a stranger who knocked on his door while he was having a bath.

Stuart Worvell was convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 20-year-old Thomas Sutton, who mistook Worvell's house for the venue of a party.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Worvell was playing loud music and taking a bath when Mr Sutton and his friend Kyle Harris, 18, presumed there was a party in his house.

The 22-year-old, known as Womble, stabbed the pair with a six-inch kitchen knife after they argued on his doorstep near Bridgend, south Wales.

He claims he acted in self-defense because the men were armed with wooden stakes.

Mr Sutton was stabbed nine times and is believed to have died within minutes.

Mr Harris was seriously injured after being stabbed three times.

Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams KT told 
Worvill: 'Moments after stabbing Thomas you stabbed Kyle Harris three times causing him life threatening injuries.

'You committed a significant, serious, unlawful attack on Kyle.

'Nothing leads me to believe you have
shown any remorse.

'Certain aspects of your behaviour in court lead me 
to the opposite conclusion.'

A jury at Cardiff Crown Court cleared him of murder but found him guilty of manslaughter.

Prosecutor Gregg Taylor QC described the knife attack at Worvill's house in Maesteg, near Bridgend, South Wales.

He said: 'Stuart Worvell was in the bath with the music up loud so he could hear it from the other room.

Victim: Thomas Sutton (pictured left) was stabbed nine times in his head, neck and chest. Police found the two men outside Worvill's home in (pictured right) Maesteg, south Wales.

Investigation: Police at the scene of double stabbing last June, where Worvell killed Mr Sutton and attempted to kill Mr Harris

'He heard knocking and went downstairs to open the door to two young men he didn't know.

'He grabbed the biggest knife he could find from the cutlery drawer in the kitchen and stabbed Thomas Sutton twice.

'The first blow was to the left hand side of the neck severing the main artery between the heart and the brain.

'The second was a wound to the left side of the chest which went deep into his lung.

'Worvell continued to stab his victim, twice to the top of the head and five times to the back.'
