A Chinese asylum seeker was kicked off a plane that was set to deport him home after staging a dramatic on-board protest.

Wei Lin, a Chinese refugee, was escorted from the Federal Court to the airport after a last minute legal bid to prevent his deportation was thwarted.

Mr Lin, who was handcuffed, was escorted by several Serco guards to the last row of seats of the Air China aircraft.

Wei Lin moved to the front of the plane just before take-off and began telling passengers he was an asylum seeker being expelled from the country against his will

Just prior to take-off, at about 9pm, Lin moved to the front of the plane and began telling passengers he was an asylum seeker being expelled from the country against his will.

The plane had already begun to move towards the runway, but the pilot announced that the incident was 'unresolved' and the plane would return to the terminal.

At about 9.50pm, Mr Lin was escorted from the aircraft and returned to the Villawood detention centre.

According to Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul, Wei is a professional athlete who was targeted due to his knowledge of the use of performance enhancing drugs in Chinese sport.

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the department adhered to its duty of care in the deportation of Mr Lin

'We are again calling on the Minister to halt attempts to deport Wei, and to halt all deportations to danger,' Mr Rintoul said.

'We are also calling on the airlines to refuse to carry forced deportations. By co-operating with the government, airline such as China Air become complicit in the government's abuse of asylum seekers' human rights.'

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said the department adhered to its duty of care in the deportation of Mr Lin.

'People who have exhausted all outstanding avenues to remain in Australia and have no lawful basis to remain are expected to depart,' he said in a statement.
