The White House announced Monday none of its staffers were involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal, as it revealed a 12th military serviceman is being investigated -- bringing the number of government employees entangled in the embarrassing case to 24.

Press Secretary Jay 
Carney said an investigation had cleared all of Obama's political staff 
of wrongdoing.

'There
was no indication that any member of the White House advance team 
engaged in any improper conduct or behavior,' Carney said.

Security breach: The latest agent suspended in the Secret Service scandal reportedly brought a prostitute back to the Hilton Cartagena Hotel where President Obama stayed five days later

Keeping a distance: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took pains to explain that the newly-revealed staffer under investigation is a US serviceman -- not a member of the Obama White House

The newest man under scrutiny in the scandal is a member of the White House Communications Agency, a military unit that provides secure communication between government officials.

Sources said the staffer is an enlisted US Army soldier. The agency works closely with the White House, but is based in the Department of Defense.

Earlier in the day, the Secret Service scandal spread to a second hotel as it was revealed that a 12th suspended agent reportedly brought a prostitute back to the Hilton where President Barack Obama stayed in Cartagena, Colombia.

The 11 other agents who were sent home to Washington in disgrace were staying at the Hotel Caribe. Some White House staffers and reporters roomed at the luxury resort, but the president never set foot there.

But the new allegation brings the potential security breach closer to the president than previously realized. Obama stayed at the Hilton Cartagena Hotel while he attended the Summit of the Americas, just five days after the agent allegedly invited the hooker there.

The White House struggled to keep an arm's length from the scandal, which has only built up speed and scope since broke up two weeks ago.

Carney took pains to describe how the White House Communications Agency, despite its name, is staffed entirely by personnel hired by the military and that it is not an arm of the Obama administration.

'The Hilton is significant because that's where President Obama was going to stay,' Sen Joseph Lieberman said Sunday on Face the Nation.

'It just gets more troubling,' he added. 'To act as these people did in Cartagena as if they were college kids on spring break, it is reprehensible.'

The embarrassment for the agency continues to grow. The Secret Service hasn't said why it suspended the 12th agent, but CBS News reports it was because he brought a prostitute back to his hotel room.

Eleven agents were recalled to Washington and suspended after many of them brought Colombian prostitutes back to their hotel rooms April 11. The agents were in Colombia to prepare security in advance of the president's arrival.

The agents' booze-fueled partying was exposed when Dania Suarez caused a commotion the next morning after one of the agents refused to pay her the $800 she says he agreed to. Local police and hotel security guards were called and word got back to Secret Service superiors.

Authorities are also investigating whether some of the 20 prostitutes the agents hired are underage girls.

Of the 12 agents allegedly involved, including two supervisors, six have left the agency, either fired, resigned or retired. One has been partially cleared with minor disciplinary action. Five remain suspended.

The US military is investigating 12 servicemen who were in Colombia helping the agents, as well.

The Secret Service's disgrace was due, in part, to the quick response of one of the agency's few female agents.

Paula Reid, who is in charge of the Secret Service's Miami office, quickly conducted an investigation at the Hotel Caribe, sent 11 agents home and notified her superiors in Washington when she received news of her colleagues misbehavior.

Her praiseworthy performance led some lawmakers to argue that scandals like this one might not happen if the Secret Service had more women in its ranks.

The embarrassing scandal has drawn the attention, and ire, of lawmakers, who are demanding answers from the Secret Service. Iowa Sen Chuck Grassley said that more 'heads have to roll' for the 
Secret Service to avoid 'mistakes.'

Rep Peter King, chairman of the powerful Committee Homeland Security, wants the names of the government employees embroiled in the incident.

King has also demanded to know whether 
federal money was used and if agents had weapons or classified material 
in the rooms where they brought the women in Cartagena earlier this 
month.

He put a deadline on
director Mark Sullivan for the information within five days according to Fox news - and answers 
as to whether the scandal reaches as high up as the Executive Office of
the President.

Grassley said the Secret Service must enact major reforms in the wake of the scandal.

'If the culture of an organisation is
going to change or mistakes like this  are not going to be repeated, 
heads have to roll and that is why I think you are going to find more 
heads rolling,’ the he said. 

Rep King told Fox News: 'I would think you'll see most of the 11 either resign, retire or will be forced to leave.

'I doubt, no matter what happens, you're going to see any of these 11 ever involved in any kind of detail like this again.'

The Secret Service, which is tasked 
with protecting the president, senior administration officials and other
prominent figures, said last week that a 12th employee had been 
implicated in the probe and another had been cleared of 'serious 
misconduct' in Cartagena but would face administrative action.

King, whose committee was probing the Cartagena incident, said the employee was involved in a separate incident that happened 'five or six days before the president arrived.'

The New York Republican said he had four investigators on the case and had spoken several times with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan about the agency's own investigation.

'We want a full record (of the probe), so at the end we can decide if the Secret Service acted appropriately once they found out about it,' King said.

Two of the original 11 Secret Service employees involved in the scandal were supervisors, he added.

'They should have been in control of everything. Instead, they were accessories. They were part of it,' King said.

'Among those eleven, besides what they did, they also are in trouble, if you will, for what they didn't do. And what they didn't do is report it,' King said.

A former director of the Secret Service said the Colombian prostitution scandal was an extraordinary incident at the agency.

He told CBS today that while agents had been disciplined in the past - none had been taken out of service.

W. Ralph Basham, who ran the service between 2003 and 2006, said: 'I don’t believe in the past these types of things have happened. They certainly didn’t happen on my watch.'
