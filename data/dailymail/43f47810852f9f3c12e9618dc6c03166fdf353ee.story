Having lost two of her beloved horses to the Great War, schoolgirl Freda Hewlett was distraught that her pony Betty would soon be called to the front line as well.

In desperation, the youngster and her brother wrote a heart-breaking letter to Lord Kitchener, pleading with the Secretary of State for War to ‘spare’ their 17-year-old mare.

Signed ‘your troubled little Britishers’, the note must have touched bureaucrats in the War Office, who agreed Betty could live out her days at the family’s farm in Haigh, near Wigan.

Now the letter, and its reply, have been put on display as part of an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum North in Salford.

The exhibition seeks to explain the facts behind Michael Morpurgo’s children’s novel War Horse, which has been made into a  movie by Steven Spielberg.

In the film, farm boy Albert fails to  persuade a cavalry unit not to enlist his horse, Joey, which goes on to experience the full horrors of the trenches culminating in the Battle of the Somme.

But Miss Hewlett apparently had more success by appealing directly to Whitehall.

Her letter, which is dated August 11, 
1914, and is addressed to ‘Dear good Lord Kitchener,’ explains that the
family have already lost two horses to the cavalry  and that they are 
‘very afraid’ of losing Betty as well.

The note, which includes the farm’s 
three-digit phone number ‘Wigan 515’, adds: ‘Please spare her. Daddy 
says she is going to be a mother early next year and she is 17 years 
old. It would break our hearts to let her go.

‘We have given two others [horses] and three of our family are now fighting for you in the Navy.

‘Mother and all will do anything for 
you but do do please let us keep old Betty and send official word 
quickly before anyone comes.’

A day later they received a reply from
the War Office, in which they were reassured that no horses under 15 
hands, which historians believe included Betty, would be sent to France.

The Once Upon A Wartime exhibition 
features items that inspired Morpurgo to write his book, including a 
painting, which usually hangs in the author’s kitchen, of Topthorn, 
another Army horse in the story.

Also on display are items loaned by 
Spielberg from the set of the film, including his manuscript and a 
jacket worn by the lead character.
