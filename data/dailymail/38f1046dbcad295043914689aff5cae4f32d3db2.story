Even in the animal world the young can annoy their parents and this leopard cub shows felines are no exception.

This is the moment a young male initiates a play fight as he jumps on his mother at the Kruger National Park in South Africa.

The young leopard was spotted calmly walking alongside his mother before being overcome by an urge to play and pouncing on his unsuspecting parent.

 The male cub attacked the older cat and tried to get her to join in the fun  - apparently unaware she was becoming quite aggravated.

The pictures show the older animal initially looking rather annoyed and the two tussle for a short time before she defeats him.

However, it would appear all is forgiven following the spat as the two lie down together side by side and the mother gives her cub an affectionate lick on the head. 

Play fighting is a very important part of growing up for leopards, which are fundamentally solitary creatures, as it teaches them essential fighting skills and encourages them to feel a sense of dominance.

It would appear all is forgiven as the mother leopard affectionately licks her cub's head following the playful spat

The African leopard ranges in size from one to almost two metres long, and weighs between 30 to 70 kg. Females are typically around two-thirds the size of male. 

In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classified leopards as near threatened and said that they may soon qualify for the status due to habitat loss. 

They are also becoming increasingly rare outside protected areas.
