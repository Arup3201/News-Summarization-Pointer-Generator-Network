A second Western Australian man has come forward to claim he was the target of a cruel Facebook hoax involving a photo of a person urinating on a war memorial.

The image of a young man desecrating on a tribute went viral on social media, aiming to shame the person responsible. 

'This is Liam Powell from Perth, western [sic] Australia urinating on a war memorial - share if you're disgusted,' the image was captioned.  

However, the wrong person was vindicated in the campaign. 

It has since been revealed that the photo was taken in England six years ago and the real culprit was 19-year-old named Philip Laing.

Contrary to the caption, this Facebook image really shows Mr Laing, 19, soaking the wreaths of poppies in 2009.

Liam Powell from Wanneroo in Perth's north is now hoping to clear his name, alleging that he was purposefully identified as the person in the image in an attempt to ruin his reputation.

Another Liam Powell, a footballer from East Perth, has already spoken out to allege that he was intentionally victimised by the post.

Both are insistent that the post was a personal attack, intended to ruin their reputation.

Mr Powell from Wanneroo told Fairfax that he has an ongoing problem with internet trolls.

'This was actually aimed at me,' he told Fairfax, refuting the earlier claims from the East Perth Powell.

'I've had a problem with people on Facebook,' he said but is bewildered as to why he is the supposedly subject of such a cruel bullying campaign.

He is feeling victimised after receiving almost 300 mostly nasty comments on Facebook regarding the viral photo. 

Philip Laing (pictured) pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service

Earlier, the other Mr Powell and his family explained that they felt shamed by the Facebook hoax as they have a military history, WA Today reported. 

Liam Powell's father, Andrew, said he's been flooded with comments from those who saw the image and the offending caption naming his 17-year-old son, who's an East Perth footballer.

'It's not Liam,' Mr Powell told WA Today. 'It's embarrassing for our family.' 

Mr Powell says he was particularly upset by the image due to his long military history.

He says his father was in the navy, his grandfather was in the Second World War and his great-grandfather also fought in the Boer War.

'Even though it's not him [Liam Powell], I feel ashamed because people think it's him,' Mr Powell said.

The real culprit, 19-year-old Mr Laing, caused revulsion in 2009 after he was pictured soaking the wreaths of poppies during a mass student bar crawl in the UK.

The student, who pleaded guilty but escaped jail time and was instead sentenced to 250 hours of community service.

Laing, is thought to have no memory of the urinating incident, which happened on a night out in 2009 when Mr Laing has been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2).  

He was ordered to pay £185 (about AUS $366) in prosecution costs.

The real culprit, Mr Laing, told probation officers back in 2009 that he had been buying drinks for £1 (about AUS $2) on the night 

Security staff later washed the memorial
