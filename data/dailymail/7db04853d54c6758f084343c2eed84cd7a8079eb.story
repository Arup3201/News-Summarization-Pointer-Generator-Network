A speeding driver who crashed into a hired car taking expectant parents to a New York City hospital has been convicted in the deaths of the couple and their baby, who was delivered alive after the wreck but didn't survive.

Julio Acevedo was found guilty Thursday of two counts of second-degree manslaughter and one count of criminally negligent homicide. 

The latter charge was related to the baby's death.

Acevedo could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced on March 18.

Nachman and Raizel Glaubers, who were 7 months pregnant at the time of the crash, were heading to the hospital in this Toyota Camry cab when they were killed

Prosecutors estimated Acevedo was going 70 mph — more than twice the legal speed limit — when he smashed into a livery car in March 2013.

Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, died that day. Their son, Tanchem, delivered by cesarean section, died a day later.

The deaths left the couple's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn grief-stricken and touched off an intense manhunt for the 44-year-old suspect, who served time in the 1990s for a shooting conviction.

Good Samaritans who stopped to help the victims told investigators that Acevedo assured them he wasn't hurt; prosecutors said he slipped away on foot, fully aware of the carnage. He surrendered in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after five days on the run.

Acevedo's family described him as a dedicated family man who quit his job to become a stay-at-home father.

'A beautiful innocent family lost their lives because Julio Acevedo chose to drive in a reckless manner,' District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said in a statement.

'Almost two years later we were able to get justice,' said Thompson, who went to the courtroom to hear the verdict. "We are grateful to the jury for following the evidence and holding Julio Acevedo accountable."
