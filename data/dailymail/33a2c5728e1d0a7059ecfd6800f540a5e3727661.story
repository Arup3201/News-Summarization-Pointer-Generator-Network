Ronny Deila told Neil Lennon that he had every right to demand better standards of fitness and nutrition at Celtic after replacing him as manager.

The Norwegian has launched a crackdown on chips and fizzy drinks at the club’s Lennoxtown training base.

And, in an impassioned defence of his methods ahead of tonight’s Europa League clash with Dinamo Zagreb at Parkhead, Deila said he must change the culture and eating habits of the Scottish champions to keep pace with Europe’s top clubs.

Without mentioning Deila by name, former manager Lennon had queried his changes in a recent radio interview, saying: ‘It’s disrespectful when a new manager comes in and immediately says: “The players aren’t fit enough”.’

However, citing Andy Murray as the example his players have to learn from, Deila said: ‘When I see the tests players are doing I see they have a lot to improve.

‘It’s not about what they were doing before. It’s all about how they are in the moment now.

‘Maybe I see things differently from what Neil (Lennon) was doing.

‘For me, to be professional is to be a 24-hour athlete. If not, then you can go and start working outside football. That’s not so hard. You can be amateurs again.

‘If Neil gets irritated by me saying we can work on how we eat and improve, that’ s up to him.

‘For me, I think from what I have seen abroad and what I have experienced myself it’s important. We just have different ways to do it.’

After a troubled start to his Celtic career, Deila earned the public backing of major shareholder Dermot Desmond this week and added: ‘Dermot and Peter (Lawwell) are very intelligent. They have seen football for many, many years. They know how to build things.

‘They wanted a change and that’s why I came in. If not, they would have gone for a manager with much more experience and would have done it more like it was done before.

‘It’s a club thing, they are going in a new direction. That’s why I’m here. You have to keep on and I believe in what I am doing.

‘I know the process is taking time, but I believe in it and I know I have the people with me to do it.’

With John Guidetti ineligible to play until the Europa League knock-out stages, Deila must reshape his attacking options against the Croatian champions.

Setting a target of three home wins from Group D after a 2-2 draw in Salzburg, Deila would have been encouraged to see Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic train on Wednesday after weekend knocks.

Commons looks the more likely option to link up with Anthony Stokes after an indifferent start by new £2.2million signing Scepovic.

Calling for supporters to be patient with the Serb, Deila insisted: ‘I talk to my players all the time. We look at what is positive and what is negative after every game. He is a very clever boy.

‘He knows he has to adapt to that kind of play. But I think the level in the Second Division in Spain is at least the same as it is here in Scotland. He knows he can score goals. I see his movement and I know goals will come.

‘But he has come to a new country, to a team with new players, he hasn’t played in a long while and there are big expectations. We have to be a little bit patient.’
