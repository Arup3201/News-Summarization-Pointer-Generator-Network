Controversial gas drilling did cause a series of earthquakes along the Lancashire coastline, a report today confirmed.

Gas company Cuadrilla Resources, which is extracting shale gas in the region, commissioned the independent study after two tremors shook Fylde coastline in April and May this year.

Energy chiefs have now sent a stark warning to the firm - either stop the earthquakes or be shut down.

How shale gas is being extracted from deep beneath Lancashire

British energy consortium Cuadrilla Resources has discovered that Lancashire is sitting on one of largest reserve of ‘shale gas’ in Europe.

According to results from its test wells, there are 200trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the ground, trapped in a layer of compacted mud.

If the gas can be recovered, it could provide Britain with enough fuel to last 50 years, plug the looming energy shortfall caused by reduced North Sea gas supplies and create 5,600 jobs.

And it could turn Blackpool from the leisure capital of the North, to the centre of England’s oil and gas industry - a Texas-by-the-sea.

Two hundred trillion cubic feet is an unimaginably vast amount of gas. It is ten times more than all the gas known to be left under the North Sea. It’s one-fifth the size of the biggest gas field in the world, and the volume of 66,666 Royal Albert Halls.

The prospect of 400 gas wells across Lancashire and thousands of new jobs - not to mention all those tax revenues - couldn’t have come at a better time for the Chancellor. But there is one problem - in gas and oil exploration, if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

It comes after Cuadrilla held urgent 
talks with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to 
consider the report into the risk of earthquakes associated with 
'fracking' - the process used to extract shale gas.

The meetings followed the British 
Geological Survey's conclusion that the two tremors felt nearby were 
most likely to have been caused by fracking.

On April 1, a magnitude 2.3 earthquake
 shook the North-West. It originated less than two miles from an 
experimental shale gas well near Blackpool run by Cuadrilla.

A second tremor occurred on May 27 with a magnitude of 1.5. The epicentre was within 500 yards of the well.

The BGS said the correlations between 
the earthquakes and the time of fracking operations, and the proximity 
of the quakes to the site, all pointed towards the earthquakes being a 
result of the fracking process.

Seismologist Brian Baptie said: 'These
 were still very small earthquakes, even by UK standards and won't cause
 any damage. If fracking continued I couldn't see the tremors getting 
much bigger.

'But it is obviously a concern for 
local residents and I'm sure the report commissioned by Cuadrilla will 
be greeted with interest.'

Cuadrilla has came under fire from 
activists for its drilling technique, which involves pumping high 
volumes of water and sand into drill holes to crack the rocks so gas can
 be extracted.

Soon after the quakes were felt the 
firm halted the fracking process after admitting the low magnitude 
tremors felt in Poulton in April and May, close to Cuadrilla's Singleton
 site , could be linked to them.

Experts today said Cuadrilla's 
operations could be shut down permanently if proposed methods to reduce 
the risk of earthquakes fail.

Toni Harvey, a senior DECC 
geoscientist, said: 'If we allow fracking to continue and their 
mitigation didn't work, then we would shut them down again, without a 
doubt.

'There is a lot of concern in the media and from ministers about public safety.

Resort town: Could the discovery of a huge amount of shale gas beneath Lancashire turn Blackpool into Texas-by-the-sea?

Fracking is a mining technique commonly used to get gas or oil from under land rather than under the sea.

To get the gas out, companies drill down into shale and form a well. They then inject wells with water, small amounts of chemicals and sand to create tiny cracks in the rock, allowing natural gas and sometimes oil to flow upwards into the well.

The technique could add about 40 per cent to previous estimates of global recoverable gas resources, with the largest known reserves are in China, the United States, Argentina and Mexico.

However, It is now feared the process could be the cause of small earthquakes.

Critics such as the Green Party say that it is environmentally unsafe because the chemicals could contaminate soil and get into drinking water.

'DECC has requested a detailed report 
from Cuadrilla, which we understand they are close to finalising. When 
the report is received, it will be carefully considered, with input from
 British Geological Survey and other experts.

'We will also be discussing the report
 with other regulators before any decision is made on resuming hydraulic
 fracturing operations for shale gas.'

Last month Cuadrilla, the first 
company to explore for shale gas in Britain, announced the Fylde coast 
holds a total potential resource of 200trillion cubic feet of gas.

It estimated the discovery - between 
Blackpool and Southport - could be worth £6billion to the UK economy and
 create 1,700 jobs locally.

However, protesters are campaigning to
 stop the drilling and anti-fracking group Frack Off - London rallied 
outside the DECC headquarters on Thursday as Cuadrilla presented its 
study.

Philip Mitchell, the chairman of the 
Blackpool and Fylde Green Party, called on the government to halt all 
British hydraulic fracturing industry activity until there has been a 
thorough and robust evaluation of the risks related to future activity.

He said: 'Any suggestion of an acceptable level of earthquakes caused by fracking should be rejected.

'The government must realise it must 
stop treating our communities like guinea pigs and accept these 
techniques carry unacceptable risks to the British public.

'Ministers must stop the industry 
activity at least until parliament and the public can be guided by a 
full and robust appraisal of the total risk to the themselves and to the
 environment.'

Mark Miller, CEO of Cuadrilla 
Resources, said: 'We met with officials from DECC and their technical 
advisors and had a useful, in-depth working session on the initial 
findings of the report.

'There is some considerable work still
 to do and we absolutely share with DECC the need to have the complex 
issues involved addressed dealt with satisfactorily.'
