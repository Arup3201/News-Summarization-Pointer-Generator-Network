Gary Lineker has called on Roy Hodgson to take a World Cup gamble on Everton teenager John Stones.

In keeping with Sportsmail’s call for the England manager to give young players a chance in Brazil, Lineker insisted yesterday that one of the most promising talents in the country ought to be on the plane this summer.

Stones has impressed since  breaking into Everton’s first team this season, after his £3million move from Barnsley last year.

And with England’s defensive cover looking thin — a situation exacerbated by the shoulder injury  sustained by Manchester United’s Phil Jones on Tuesday — Lineker believes Hodgson should turn to the 19-year-old centre half, who has never previously been called up to the senior squad.

‘The one I might take a chance on, because we are so short in central defence, is Stones,’ said Lineker, a former Everton striker.

‘I really like him. He has got a lot about him. Sometimes central defenders need a little bit more experience than other positions because of the extra discipline and the nature of that role. But is he worth a gamble? Well, if Phil Jones doesn’t make it — what else have we got?’

Gary Cahill and Phil  Jagielka are set to be  Hodgson’s first-choice centre back pairing in Brazil.But beyond that pair, Lineker admitted he is concerned by his options,  particularly Steven Caulker, who has not been especially impressive at Cardiff City.

Lineker said: ‘We have got Cahill and Jagielka and then Caulker, who struggles a bit on the turn. We are short in that position.’

United’s Jones is clinging to his World Cup dream after X-rays  confirmed that he did not dislocate his shoulder on Tuesday.

The club have turned to one of the country’s top shoulder specialists to oversee Jones’ recovery. FA medical staff have also been kept fully informed about the injury as they wait for the swelling to subside before making a proper diagnosis.

Jones has been told he is unlikely to need immediate surgery, which would have ruled him out of the tournament in Brazil next month.

The versatile defender has been assured that his shoulder did not  disclocate and didn’t fracture during the clash with Hull defender Maynor Figueroa.

Although the swelling points to potential ligament damage, Jones is determined to declare himself fit for selection ahead of Hodgson’s squad announcement in Luton on Monday.

England have a growing casualty list after Tottenham winger Andros Townsend was ruled out of the squad last week with an ankle injury.

Theo Walcott is also out and  Hodgson had other concerns at  centre half after a long-term injury to Jagielka, but he has returned to Everton’s first team in recent weeks.
