Middlesbrough forward Mustapha Carayol is close to signing a new contract, despite being on loan at Championship rivals Brighton.

The-26-year-old joined the Seagulls until the end of the season last week, but is set to put pen to paper on a new two-and-a-half year deal at the Riverside Stadium.

Boro boss Aitor Karanka, despite allowing in Carayol leave on loan, still feels the Gambian can have a career under him and has pushed for him to sign an extension.

It is hoped he can get some regular game time at the Amex Stadium before returning north ahead of next season.
