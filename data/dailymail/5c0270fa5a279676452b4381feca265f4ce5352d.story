A surge in testosterone in newborn boys just hours after birth could be the solution to the age-old mystery that is the difference between the male and female brains.

Called the Hershey Kiss protein by researchers, the surge only affects the male brain, a new study by the University of Otago has found. 

The study published in the Journal of Neuroscience observed a small group of neurons linked to fertility are only active in male newborn mice, and not females.

Kisspeptin - where the 'Kiss' in the name originated - is a small protein which stimulates a certain type of neurons, a process that researchers found only occurred in males.

New research suggests a release of testosterone shortly after baby boys are born could account for the differences between the male and female brains

These neurons are Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), and are cells that control the release of reproductive hormones from the brain's pituitary gland.

The molecule was originally named after the Hershey Kiss chocolate by US cancer researchers based in Hershey, Pennsylvania, who at the time were unaware of its role in fertility. 

The Otago study also found that when kisspeptin binds to specific nerves it kick-starts a brief but powerful testosterone surge in male babies within five hours of birth, causing their brains to develop differently from females right form the get-go.

This could have implications on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer.

Called Hershey Kisses, the protein could also shed light on the neurological disorders from which men and women suffer

The study's leader Allan Herbison said the findings highlight the role kisspeptin can play in controlling fertility.

'Not only does kisspeptin signalling act as a master switch for puberty and ovulation, we now show how in the first hours of drawing breath it also triggers our brains to develop differently according to our sex,' he said.

The study was carried out by Professor Herbison with Jenny Clarkson from the Centre for Neuroendocrinology in collaboration with researchers in Canada and Germany.
