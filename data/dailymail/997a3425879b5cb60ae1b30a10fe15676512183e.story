Manchester United are weighing up a swap deal involving Javier Hernandez and Inter Milan midfielder Fredy Guarin, according to reports in Italy.

The Mexico forward has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer, after featuring intermittently for the club last season.

And Guarin looks set to leave the Serie A giants, though the Colombia international has rejected offers from Wolfsburg and Zenit St Petersburg in recent weeks.

According to Italian paper Tuttosport, Inter are keen to recruit a striker before the start of the Serie A season, while United boss Louis van Gaal wants to add another central midfielder to his squad.

Speaking about Hernandez's future, Van Gaal said: 'I will have to see how he plays.

'I
 have only seen him under another coach so far. He has arrived today and
 now I can see him play in a game. Then I can talk about him.'

Earlier
 this month former United defender Nemanja Vidic, who joined Inter this 
summer after eight seasons at Old Trafford, said he was keen for 
Hernandez to join him in Milan.

'These things are up to clubs,' Vidic told reporters.

'Obviously, Chicharito will be a good signing for every club and we'd be glad to have him.'
