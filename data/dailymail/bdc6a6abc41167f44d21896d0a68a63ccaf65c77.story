A 28-year-old woman has described the terrifying moment a speeding car fleeing police officers ploughed into her house as she slept.

She was in bed at her semi-detached property in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when the BMW skipped over a grass verge and smashed into her front room at 2am yesterday.

The car had been driving off from a police vehicle that had signalled for it to stop. The woman said she heard sirens, shouting and running - and the noise was 'like being woken up by an earthquake'.

The woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I was asleep in bed when I
 heard this big smashing sound.

'The house had been broken into recently,
 so my first thought was "someone is in
 the house and they have just smashed something downstairs".

'It was only 
when I heard a police officer shouting outside I realised it was 
something else.’

Her boyfriend, Neil O’Malley, who was not in the house at the time, said: ‘She said it was like being woken up by an earthquake - except with lots of shouting and running.

‘It was so surreal that if it wasn’t for the following police sirens, she might have thought she was still in a strange dream.’

He added that the house might need some proper structural work but the full extent of the damage would not be known until they did more investigations.

The woman, who rents the house, added: ‘It was quite an ordeal. I couldn’t believe what happened.  Nothing has been damaged inside the house but the whole outside is a mess.’

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘At about 2.25am a BMW car crashed into the front of a house after driving off from a police vehicle that had signalled for it to stop shortly before.

‘A 24-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of theft of a motor vehicle. He was taken to hospital for a check-up and later discharged and is currently in police custody.

‘A 28-year-old woman, who was the sole occupant of the property, was uninjured. The vehicle has been recovered from the scene. Significant damage was caused to a bay window at property and the structure is being assessed.’
