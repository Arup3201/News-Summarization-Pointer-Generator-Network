A University of Cincinnati football staffer has found himself without a job and facing a sex crime rap after his employers learned last week that a 73-year-old grocery store employee claims he exposed himself and touched her with his genitals in May.

Antrione Archer, 28, allegedly asked for help in the pharmacy aisle in a Kenton County, Kentucky Kroger, where the employee says 'pulled his penis from his pants' and 'placed his exposed penis against her backside.'

Archer was fire Tuesday after the school learned of the alleged incident. Archer has since announced plans to appeal the firing.

The school said in a release it learned about the arrest Friday and first put Archer on administrative leave pending an investigation. 

Court records in Kenton County Justice Court show a jury trial scheduled for Oct. 15, with a pretrial conference set for Monday.

Archer's lawyer told the television station Archer was close to having the situation resolved through the legal system.

Archer had been Director of Player Welfare and Development with Cincinnati's football program since 2011, acting as a liaison between coaches and players.

In a July 2013 interview with the Bearcat Journal, Archer gave his take on player behavior off the field and on sexual misconduct, SB Nation points out.

'We talk to them about carrying themselves in the right way and being around the right people. A couple weeks ago we did a session on sexual conduct to give them some education on keeping themselves out of any situations they shouldn't be in. Luckily, we really haven't had many issues,' he said.
