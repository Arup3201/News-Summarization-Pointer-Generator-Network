Australian free-to-air television viewers could soon be subject to an extra seven minutes of advertising every hour under proposals from some of the biggest television networks.

Networks can only show a maximum of 13 minutes of 'non-program matter' between 6pm and midnight, according to the code of practice set out by Free TV Australia.

These rules are relaxed under certain conditions such as during elections, with promotions for the program itself also not falling under the category of 'non-program matter'.

Leading national free-to-air television networks Seven and Nine are arguing for advertisement regulations to be relaxed to allow a maximum of 20 minutes of adds within each hour of programming

However Network Seven along with the Nine Network are now calling for the limit to be increased to 20 minutes of advertisements within every hour.

'The proposal being discussed at FreeTV is to make advertising time limits for the main channel consistent with what is already the case on multi-channels. These don't seem to have caused any major problems or viewer complaints for the past four years, a spokesperson for Seven told Daily Mail Australia.

'This is really just about allowing more flexibility in scheduling advertising and not running two sets of traffic systems across the various channels.Â  We would not envisage any significant uplift in overall advertising minutes out of the changes.'

Free TV Australia recently appeared to agree on the lack of flexibility free networks faced in terms of advertising in a recent submission to the Contemporary Community Safeguards inquiry.

Network ten is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase, however recent data released by Ebiquity found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement limits

'While broadcasters recognise that there are community expectations that an appropriate balance between program matter and advertising is maintained, the existing requirements are overly complicated,' the submission stated.

The submission also clarified that advertising was essential for free-to-air television, to ensure the service remains a free and competitive service.

Network Ten is the only major network that has opposed the advertisement increase, with a spokesperson telling Daily Mail Australia: 'Such a move would disenfranchise the audience and damage the viewing experience'.

However data released by Ebiquity to Mumbrella earlier this year, found that all three stations are already exploiting their advertisement regulations by running up to 29 minutes of ads during their prime time airing.

The biggest culprits were revealed to be programs such as The Voice, House Rules and Masterchef.

Chanel Seven currently receives more than 40 per cent of all advertising revenue nationally, while the Nine Network receives just over 38 per cent.

Channel 10's ratings have fallen below the two leading stations, with its advertising revenue making up the final 20 per cent.

Daily Mail Australia have approached the Seven, Nine and Ten networks for a comment.
