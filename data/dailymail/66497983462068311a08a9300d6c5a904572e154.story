Ministers were warned they face a legal challenge over Britain’s membership of the European Arrest Warrant last night as bitter recriminations flew about the ‘shambolic’ Commons vote on the issue.

Eurosceptic Tory MPs variously blamed David Cameron, Theresa May, Michael Gove and William Hague for the chaotic scenes that unfolded as a package of EU crime and justice measures was approved.

Senior Tories also turned their fire on Commons Speaker John Bercow, accusing him of siding with Labour to deliberately inflame the row. MPs now plan to try to oust Mr Bercow next May and replace him with his popular Labour deputy, Lindsay Hoyle.

Under fire: Speaker John Bercow accused ministers of behaving ‘contemptuously’ in the Commons on Monday

The Speaker triggered uproar in the Commons on Monday night by accusing ministers of behaving ‘contemptuously’ and presiding over a ‘sorry saga’ by not offering a specific vote on the arrest warrant.

Instead, the Government sought specific approval to rejoin the 11 measures not yet in British law, but made clear a vote against would mean the entire package, including the arrest warrant, not being implemented.

In the event, the Government won by 464 to 38, a majority of 426.

But former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler last night announced he is to seek a High Court injunction against Britain opting back into the warrant.

Mr Wheeler said his opposition to the warrant was being backed by Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg to spearhead wider opposition to the warrant. He claimed rejoining the arrest warrant ‘will largely make Magna Carta, which has been a big source of liberty for the individual in this country for nearly 800 years, irrelevant’.

Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox said Mr Bercow had gone ‘over the top’ in triggering the furore.

But he acknowledged: ‘I think it would have been better for all concerned if the Government had simply put down an adjournment motion and debated the European arrest warrant in itself.’ 

Ministers were ‘technically correct’ that a motion including the warrant would have been meaningless, since the measure is already on the statute book.

But he added: ‘I think the House was angry because the House wanted a specific debate on a specific issue.’

Former Home Office minister Damian Green said it had ‘not been a triumph of Parliamentary handling’, but raised questions about Mr Bercow’s conduct.

‘The danger is if he appears to be just against this executive – just against this government,’ he said.

Labour said it would give MPs another vote on the arrest warrant next week – the day before the by-election in Rochester and Strood. But the debate will be symbolic since the outcome of a vote will not be binding on the Government.

Downing Street said last night: ‘We were very clear.

‘There was an opportunity for MPs if they did not support the package of 35 measures, then the UK would have come out of all of them.’
