Samantha Cameron’s 41st birthday on April 18 will be marked by a party at Chequers, with a DJ in attendance, says a Tory source who explains: ‘She didn’t really have a party on her 40th because daughter Florence was only six months old.’

Up until his exposure two weeks ago, party treasurer Peter Cruddas was offering £250,000 donors access to David and Samantha Cameron.

He boasted to undercover reporters about a Chequers event, saying: ‘I was sitting next to Sam and I said to her, “Do you want a Ruby Murray?”, and she said, “Yeah, go on then.”

So I went up and got her a Ruby Murray – a curry.’

Might the rascal have infiltrated £250,000 donors into SamCam’s 41st birthday bash?

Chelsea FC magnate Roman Abramovich’s 536ft gin palace Eclipse won’t be the largest private yacht in the world much longer.

A 656ft mega-yacht, Everest,  is being constructed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Sunk: Roman Abramovich's super yacht Luna is set to lose its crown as the World's biggest privately-owned yacht

It can accommodate 36 passengers in 17 private apartments  as well as 60 crew. Cost: around £290million. No buyer so far. How about Tony and Cherie?

Has the BBC over-estimated the attraction of presenter Gary Lineker, pictured?

He tells Twitter followers he is to be the face of their  prime-time Olympics coverage, from 7pm to 10pm each night.

The
former footballer is also to present their coverage of June’s European 
Football Championship and – prior to the Olympics – the Open Golf from 
Lytham St Annes. Too much of a good thing?

Radio
4’s drama serial, The Man Who Knows, set in a 1960s’ newspaper office, 
featured the struggle between Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch to take 
over the News of the World in the 1960s. 

They are described, respectively, as ‘a socialist’ and ‘a convict’. What’s Murdoch done to deserve this description?

‘Nothing,’
says one of the characters, ‘but he’s from Melbourne.’ Author Mark 
Lawson – a Radio 4 broadcaster – might have known this would go down 
well at the BBC.

Hatred of Rupert seems to be a prerequisite for employment there.

Asked sarcastically in 1995, by TV 
comedienne Mrs Merton, ‘So, what  first attracted you to the millionaire
Paul Daniels?’, dancer Debbie McGee, 53, says her husband of 24 years 
remains a source of surprise and delight.

New show: Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee are back on the road again with a new magic tour

The couple are touring with their latest magic show, Hair Today Gone Tomorrow.

Debbie says: ‘It’s never the same two nights running, and that’s been the same for the past  30-odd years.’ So much for Mrs Merton’s cynicism.

Having angered locals by criticising Liverpool FC’s insistence on not playing on the anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster, comedian Alan Davies is due to perform his Life is Pain stage show in the city on September 23.

‘If he’s got any sense, he’ll cancel,’ says my source.

‘Otherwise, his own life might become a pain in the fullest sense.’

Are we getting too much of Gary Lineker?
