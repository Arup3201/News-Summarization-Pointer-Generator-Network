MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli celebrated signing a new three-year deal at the club by scoring a hat-trick at the weekend.

The 18-year-old is attracting interest from the top flight in England and abroad and his manager Karl Robinson has done well to hold on to him.

Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham takes a look at who the player is and what all the fuss is about.

Where's he come from?

Alli was born in Milton Keynes and has come through the club's academy, which he joined aged 11. He had already made his debut by the time he was 16 – his first ever touch in professional football an audacious back-heel in an FA Cup match against Cambridge – and scored in his second game, a 35-yard screamer.

He is in the England Under 19 squad, where he was one of the stand-out performers in their recent draw with Germany.

Who's raving about him?

It's probably easier to list who isn't. After his hat-trick against Crewe on Saturday MK Dons boss Robinson said: 'This kid isn't 19 until April and in every game he has either scored or assisted a goal.'

The club's chairman Pete Winkelman told Robinson that he had not seen a better individual performance from a player at the club.

Alli has now scored six goals in his first 10 games this season.

Who's interested in him?

Liverpool had a £3.5million bid rejected for Alli in the summer and news of the player has spread to Germany where Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are showing an interest.

But Alli is following some sound advice and sticking with League One side MK Dons, at least for the near future, where the teenager is becoming one of focal points of the team.

What's his playing style?

Alli is an all-action central midfielder, tough in the tackle, strong on the ball, who can pass and finish well and has an engine that effortlessly gets him from box to box all game.

He told Sportsmail: 'Whilst I'm young I'd like to think I make forward runs a lot, getting goals and assists.

'That's what I want to add to my game. I think I can play quite defensive as well. That deep midfield role or a high attacking one. I enjoy playing both.'

Who does he most play like?

Alli has been compared to Liverpool's Steven Gerrard for his all-round ability. That is quite a player to live up to, but a comparison that he welcomes.

'He is a big idol of mine, I've always watched him,' Alli said. 'Being a Liverpool fan it's great to have someone like that to look up to.'

He also, rather jokingly, claimed he was a cross between Gerrard and Yaya Toure recently.

What's he like off the field?

The player enjoys relaxing at home when he is not on the training ground preparing for matches or in action with the team. He is also giving another sport a go. 'I'm trying to get into golf,' he added. 'I'm awful at the minute but it's something I'm trying to get into.'
