It is a sumptuous design more familiar with superyachts than a private jet.

But theses renderings show just what £400million will buy you if you're splashing out on a full-size Boeing 747-8 for one person.

The aircraft, which would normally carry up to 450 passengers, has been converted into a private jet for an unknown owner with a complete re-design to feature everything you would normally find on board a luxury mega yacht.

The plane retails in at around £230million, and the estimated 'improvement' work is an additional £160 million taking the overall expense to almost £400million.

And Greenpoint Technologies, who have transformed the plane, have delivered the aircraft to an unidentified private owner after three years of hard graft.

Although no photos have been released, the company have shown off digital renderings of the design, and these give an accurate portrayal of the class and luxury inside.

The 747-8 can normally cater for around 450 passengers, and is the world's longest passenger jet with a cabin space 20ft wide and 200m in length.

That is more than enough room to add in the owner's specifications for the redesign, that included a restaurant, dining room, master and guest bedrooms, two large lounge areas and office space. 

The VIP lounge offers a chance to relax with a tipple of your choice, with large walkways ensuring you can entertain for groups

The conference room may be where stresses of business are talked through, but it's worth remembering the luxury you are in

 The luxurious Boeing 747-8 plane is thought to have cost almost £400million to buy, with the redesign alone costing £160million

Well, the office space is more conference room, and no doubt the owner of such a luxury will be well accustomed to business meetings.

The master bedroom will leave you wondering what the fuss was over first class - a sizeable bed in complemented by a chill-out seating area, and with lots of windows, the room is as bright and airy as it is comfortable.

The Aeroloft provides private sleeping berths located above the main deck in the aft section of the Boeing 747-8. This area is installed with custom designed interior furnishings and a forward entry staircase.

VIP clients appreciate the benefit of providing passengers and guests a private rest area above the main deck for additional relaxation and comfort.

Writing on the company website, Bret Neely, vice president of sales, said: 'Being a Boeing-only completion center is a key advantage to our clients. They know we have the technical experience to deliver on our promise.'
