Accident: A car driven by Margaret Lowery, 79, crashed into a vehicle with Darren Handyside, 46, and his two children, Jack, 10, and Sophie, eight

A pensioner made a courtroom apology as she was spared jail for causing a head-on crash that left two young children fighting for their lives.

Margaret Lowery - a 79-year-old widow described as a 'community-spirited' member of society - was behind the wheel of a Vauxhall Corsa when it left the road, mounted a grass verge and slammed into an oncoming Rover 25.

Darren Handyside, 46, and his two children, Jack, 10, and Sophie, eight, were left with horrific injuries following the smash on September 29 last year on the A688 road near Staindrop, County Durham.

Lowery, 79, from Sandford Court, Sunderland, had been driving erratically in the lead-up to the crash and when questioned was unable to explain what had happened.

She emerged 'virtually unscathed' and told detectives she had 'felt light-headed' but had no recollection of the crash.

During a sentencing hearing at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, prosecutor Adrian Dent said the accident caused 'devastating damage to Mr Handyside’s vehicle' and said it was a 'miracle that nobody was killed'.

Mark Savill, defending, told Judge Tony Briggs the case may cause some 'judicial discomfort' given Lowery's age and 50-year unblemished driving record.

He said: 'No-one can could fail to be moved and humbled by the accounts of the devastation that the driving that occurred on this day caused.

'All people who hear this case will realise the transient existence that many of us live day-to-day, taking for granted the content, happy and normal lives that most are given but that can change in an instance.

'Mrs Lowery offers a sincere and immediate apology for the affects of this case.

'I don't know how much weight that will carry, certainly with those affected physically in the accident, but it is offered by her, through me, and carries particular weight given her age, her experience of grandmotherhood, her experience of motherhood and the fact she is a thoroughly decent member of society.'

Accident: Jack Handyside and his sister Sophie. They suffered head and body injuries and they 'have had an appalling long-term effect'

He added: 'This is not a driver who should not have been on the road that day. There's no evidence to suggest that.

'It's rare for an advocate to have the privilege of delivering mitigation of a nature and substance that is present in this case.

'My words can never do justice to the type of individual Mrs Lowery is. There's an element of the surreal that she should be sitting in the dock of a crown court.

Repentant: Mr Savill told the court Lowery had surrendered her documents and had no desire to get behind the wheel of a car again

'She's devoted her life to her family, to hard work in a bank and later as a shopkeeper. She's somebody who puts others before herself and after settling into retirement she's engaged in voluntary work.

'Given her age and given her character she would not hesitate in taking the pain and suffering that Mr Handyside and his children have suffered upon herself.'

Suspending a 15-month sentence for two years, Judge Tony Briggs told Lowery: 'This case in my experience is an extremely unusual one.

'I’ve seen many cases where the most appalling piece of driving has caused no injury.

'I see other cases where a momentary lapse in attention has caused the most catastrophic consequences.'

He added: 'The tragedy of this case is the catastrophic injuries caused to Mr Handyside and his two young children.

'The three suffered head and body injuries and they have had an appalling long-term effect.'

Widowed grandmother Lowery, a former bank worker and shop assistant, entered a guilty plea to dangerous driving.

Mr Savill told the court Lowery, a WI member who had held an unblemished driving licence for 50 years, had surrendered her documents and had no desire to get behind the wheel of a car again.

Lowery had her driving licence disqualified for life.
