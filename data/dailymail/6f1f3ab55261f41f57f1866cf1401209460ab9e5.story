Yes and No campaigners voted in 'incredible' numbers  - pushing turnout to the highest-ever recorded level.

Some 84.6 per cent of Scots exercised their right to vote at polling stations across the country.

This was higher than any election in the United Kingdom since the introduction of universal suffrage in 1918.

Politicians said the turnout was a 'triumph of the democratic process' and showed that people would vote if they believed there was something worth voting for and that their efforts made a difference.

The previous highest UK turnout was 83.9 per cent in the 1950 general election, when Clement Atlee's Labour Party beat Winston Churchill's Conservatives for the second time.

In Scotland, the previous record was 81.2 per cent in the 1951 election, when the result was reversed.

But turnouts in recent general elections - and Scottish Holyrood elections - have been much, much lower.

The last Westminster election, in 2010, saw a turnout of just 65.1 per cent per cent; while the 2011 Scottish Parliament election saw Alex Salmond gain a majority on a turnout of only 50.4 per cent.

However, in the historic referendum battle, a total of 3,619,915 people voted Yes or No - a turnout of 84.59 per cent.

A total of 4,285,323 people were registered to vote, including 16- and 17-year-olds for the first time.

Turnout reached 91 per cent in East Dunbartonshire, 90.4 per cent in East Renfewshire and 90.1 per cent in Stirling.

But turnout was lower in 'yes' areas such as Glasgow (75 per cent) and Dundee (78.8 per cent).

Mr Salmond, Scotland's first minister, said the turnout was 'one of the highest in the democratic world for any election or any referendum in history'.

'This has been a triumph for the democratic process and for participation in politics,' he said.

Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, said voters had set politicians a challenge to respond to the desire for change.

'What we are all struck by, whether Yes or No campaigners or supporters, is the incredible turnout that we've seen in this referendum campaign,' he said.

'The challenge for all of us is to tap into that real desire for change and to take on the task of unifying our country whatever the result, and bringing people together to create a better future for ourselves and for future generations.'

Colin Fox, from the Scottish Socialist Party, said: 'The big story tonight is the astonishing levels of turnout in a political contest in Scotland, which is on a par with North Korea, China, Cuba and those places.'
