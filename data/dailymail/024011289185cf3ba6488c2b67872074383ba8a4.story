A Swedish mother has been left shame-faced after the secret sex chamber she set up at an abandoned military bunker was uncovered.

Two fisherman were left baffled when stumbled on the old bunker near the town of Nordmaling on Sweden's east coast last Friday.

They found what appeared to be either a garden of earthly delights 
complete with a silk-sheet laden bed, ropes, dildos and leather items - or a crime scene.

Assuming it was a crime scene, they reported their find to local authorities, and once word got out about the sex chamber, Swedish language newspaper Aftonbladet reported 'a hard-working single mum in her 40s' came clean about it.

It seems the woman - who is calling herself 'Lena' - set it up for trysts with a man she dated a few times.

With news of her hideout becoming public, she decided to get in touch with the Swedish paper in order to clear up any misunderstanding, The Huffington Post reported.

'I just wanted to test my limits,' she told authorities.

Experienced bondage buffs said the incident proves that the 'D' in 'BDSM' stands for discretion as well as discipline.

Dee Severe, a filmmaker whose company Severe Society Films specializes in fetish films, said people who are interested in exploring BDSM need to think about how they will react if their lifestyle becomes public knowledge.

'Think people are narrow-minded about gay rights? Their reaction to BDSM is three steps further,' Severe told The Huffington Post.

'People need to gauge how family and friends might react and then decide how secretive you need to be.'

The Swedish mother told Aftonbladet she learned an important lesson from the incident

'Sweden is not really such a free country when it comes to sexuality,' she told the paper, and promised to make sure to tidy up after herself next time.
