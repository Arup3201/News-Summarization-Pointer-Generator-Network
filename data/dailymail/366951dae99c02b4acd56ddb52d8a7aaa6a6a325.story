The Green Mile star Michael Clarke Duncan has been on a respirator since being hospitalised on Friday in LA after suffering a heart attack.

But the 325 pound actor is said to be 'breathing above the respirator', according to TMZ, with doctors optimistic about his recovery prospects.

The website today reports that tests were performed on Monday and doctors determined Michael has a 'very strong heartbeat'.

Health scare: Michael Clarke Duncan, pictured with girlfriend 
Omarosa earlier this year, has been on a respirator since Friday after suffering a heart attack

The actor has been sedated ever since his heart attack, however, and 
doctors remain unsure what his condition will be, according to reports.

Publicist
Joy Fehily said in a brief email statement on the weekend that the 54-year-old actor 
'suffered a myocardial infarction' early on Friday.

She said his heart rate had stabilised and he's expected to make a full recovery.

Fehily would not confirm a
report that Duncan's actress-girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, 
discovered the former bodyguard in distress at about 2am Friday in 
his Los Angeles area home.

The website reported that Omarosa revived Duncan by performing CPR.Â 

The former The Apprentice star, who has been dating the actor since 2010, is understood to be by his bedside in an intensive care unit.

Her representative Priscilla Clarke 
confirmed Duncan was hospitalised but didn't provide any further 
details regarding his condition.

Kent
Moran, who directed Duncan in The
Challenger, tells MailOnline the actor recently wrapped scenes on the 
action drama, in which he stars as a trainer helping to revive the 
career of boxer Jaden Miller.

Moran, who also stars as Miller in the film, described Duncan as 'very healthy' on set and said he coped well with the physicality of the role, adding that news of the actor falling ill was 'unexpected'.

He added: 'We were very surprised and saddened to hear the news. Our film 
is now in post production and we have finished filming Michael's scenes.
So at this point, we are really just praying for him and wishing him a 
speedy recovery.'

Duncan's co-star from The Finder, Geoff Stults, visited the actor in hospital and said he is recovering well, telling TMZ: 'I saw him... he's looking good... that's all we know right now.'

Duncan meanwhile hinted at his health issues in a public service announcement released by PETA in May.

The PSA, which promotes vegetarianism as a means to prevent heart disease and stroke, features Duncan saying he was plagued with several illnesses before making the dietary change three years ago.

He does not elaborate on his health problems in the clip.

The actor says watching film Meet Your Meat, about the process of animal protein production, helped him to decide to stop eating meat.

'I never knew what the process was from that animal to my plate,' he says. 'Once I looked at an animal like that I cleared out my refrigerator of about $5,000 worth of meat.'

Duncan catapulted to fame after his role in 1999 prison drama The Green Mile. He is also well-known for his roles in the 2003 comic book movie Daredevil and 2005 release Sin City.

He is currently starring in TV drama The Finder.
