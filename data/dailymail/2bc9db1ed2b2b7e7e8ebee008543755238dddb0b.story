Banners, flags and cheers welcomed weary soldiers back to the U.S. on Friday - but there is nothing like a kiss from the one you love to make the homecoming extra special.

Soldier Sabryna Schlagetter got a smacker from her wife, Cheyenne Nicole Schlagetter, on Friday morning after she returned to Fort Carson, Colorado from Afghanistan.

According to social media, the newlyweds also recently bought their first home.

The couple were among hundreds of celebrating family members who turned out at the base with handmade posters, dressed to the nines to welcome their loved ones home.

Other troops were also returning to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach.

About 135 soldiers arrived at Fort Carson in Colorado on Friday after a nine-month deployment to the Middle East. 

The 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, had been gone since March as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The brigade's job was to train, advise and assist the Afghan National Security Forces and support security at the Afghanistan presidential and runoff elections.

Operation Enduring Freedom is the name given to smaller military operations organized by the U.S. government in Afghanistan as part of the global War On Terror.
