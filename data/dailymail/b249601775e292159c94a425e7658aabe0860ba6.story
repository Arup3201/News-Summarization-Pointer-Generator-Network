James Haskell accepts England should be toppling the southern hemisphere giants and takes no pride in being 'plucky runners-up'.

Successive defeats by New Zealand and South Africa have elevated the remaining two QBE Internationals against Samoa and Australia into matches that Stuart Lancaster's under-pressure team dare not lose.

Haskell is set to win his 51st cap at Twickenham on Saturday as one of the changes Lancaster is expected to make, and while he remembers a time when three-point defeats to the All Blacks and Springboks were tolerable, he insists those days are now long gone.

Billy Twelvetrees has found himself out of favour with England despite featuring heavily last season 

'I have been involved with England when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides and when a narrow loss would have been acceptable,' Haskell said.

'But this side has now developed to a point where we have beaten the world champions and where we ultimately should be beating these teams and be right up there.

'It's very easy to see us as plucky runners-up, but not one person in this entire environment has ever said that is the case.

'No one is satisfied to only be pushing those teams close. We realise we want to be beating them, we should be beating them and we are doing all the things in our power to make that happen.

'As players we are our own biggest critics. I don't really read the papers because I know what I have done wrong. I don't need a mark out of 10 to tell me I have done something wrong.'

Head coach Stuart Lancaster has now watched his side lose five consecutive games 

New Zealand and South Africa have stormed Twickenham on successive weekends to extend England's losing run to five matches, with just 10 months left until next year's home World Cup is launched.

Losing to the sport's dominant forces at the venue where all but three of the knockout games will be staged would appear to be a significant setback, but Haskell disagrees.

'Frankly, players don't sit here now talking about the World Cup, what we're going to do when we get there and how we're going to do it, because the rugby landscape changes dramatically from month to month,' the Wasps back row said.

'There's so much rugby to be played, so yes these games are important and it would be great to have those wins in the bank, but my view is they don't have any bearing.

'Just because we lost on Saturday doesn't mean we're going to lose at the World Cup.

Haskell is expected to replace Tom Wood (right) at blindside flanker against Samoa this weekend

'We're aware that we have to develop and we're working hard to do that. I have every confidence we'll push those teams and get the results.'

Haskell is expected to replace Tom Wood at blindside flanker against Samoa on Saturday, with Ben Morgan relieving Billy Vunipola at number eight in a new-look back row that will see Chris Robshaw as the sole survivor.

England have been described as a team in crisis and Samoa and Australia must be dispatched if they are to salvage a measure of respect from a disappointing campaign.

Haskell has urged his team-mates to be bold against the Pacific Islanders

'I hope we don't go into our shell, that's certainly not the impression of what will happen that I'm getting from the guys. There will be boys coming into the team who want to put their hands up,' Haskell said.

'Our nature and game plan isn't about going into our shell. That just doesn't work and I've got every confidence that won't happen.'
