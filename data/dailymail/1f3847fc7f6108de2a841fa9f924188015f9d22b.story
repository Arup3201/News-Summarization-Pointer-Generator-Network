Not long ago, I was hurtling along a narrow aisle of a large department store, on an errand that I didn't really have time for, very late, harassed, hot, sweaty, grumpy and most definitely unkempt, and I saw a middle-aged woman running towards me.

I noticed as she came nearer that she looked a bit like a demented crone; she was small and haggard, had a gaunt face and lines around her eyes, and on her face was an anxious expression.

Her hair needed washing. I think her shirt was wrongly buttoned. She was obviously in a hurry and in a state.

Surprise reflection: Nicci doesn't feel like a 56-year-old woman 

I put up a hand in apology and she put her hand up as well - and I realised that she was me. I was looking at myself in a mirror. I was that demented crone.

I was stopped in my tracks. So this was how I looked to strangers when I was running through a department store on an errand: not slim and poised and purposeful but scrawny, worried and slightly unhinged.

It was a grim and hilarious revelation. How many of us look in the mirror and think: but that's not me, not the real me, the one I carry round inside myself.

I'm 56 now, and all my children are in their 20s; polite young men sometimes stand up for me on buses or offer to help me carry my fold-up bike up escalators.

I need glasses for reading and have a nasty suspicion my hearing's getting worse; I have lines round my eyes and fillings in my mouth and stretch marks on my stomach and when I examine myself I think, how on earth did that happen? Where did I go, the self I used to be?

As she was: Nicci still feels like the young mother of tiny children

There is always a gap between how we feel inside ourselves and how the world sees us. Sometimes this gap is comfortingly narrow and seems bridgeable; at other times it yawns horribly, so that the self we experience and the one that other people encounter appear almost unconnected.

I think that this bewildering and often frightening mismatch between the way we see and know ourselves and the way the world sees us happens more often and more powerfully as we get older - because, of course, inside our minds and our hearts and our heads, we are still young, still just getting going on life's journey, still making up our minds who we want to be.

Because, of course, I'm not really 56. I’m ten and jumping in puddles in my red wellington boots; I’m 15 and falling in love for the first time; I’m 18 and leaving home; I'm a student, a newly-wed, an over-eager young employee, a mother of tiny children, of not so tiny children...

But the mirror ignores the selves I carry with me and can only, mercilessly, show me my 56-year-old self, unmistakably bashed about by life and all its ambushes.

And people can only see that 56-year-old - or increasingly, perhaps, don’t see her. Or, when they meet my mother, they can only see a woman in her 80s, registered blind, who has had cancer and multiple strokes and is frail, precarious.

They see her age and they admire her for her tenacity. 'Isn't she marvellous?' they say. And she is marvellous, a marvel, but not just because she is old and indomitable but because she is a passionate and fiercely optimistic woman.

If you asked her how old she felt, she would probably say 21. She is 82 years young and she still feels that life is ahead of her.

Both grown up: Nicci wonders where the young woman and her baby have gone

Today: The author feels she's judge more by her age now than her personality

It is because of my mother and women like her that I wrote my novel, The Twilight Hour, which is both the story of 94-year-old Eleanor, whose future is very short and whose secret past is long, and also the story of the young and beautiful Eleanor, full of hopes and desires.

I wanted to hold both these women together and show how the old Eleanor is also the radiant young one. For as we age we become increasingly invisible, except as a category. And for the old, this category is becoming larger all the time. A few decades ago, it was rare to reach your late 80s or 90s and those who did were valued: they had lived so long and seen so much, lived through depressions and wars.

Now it is common. Old people are talked about as a large and problematic group, a burden on the NHS, taking up hospital beds, increasingly expensive and time-consuming as they reach the last years of the journey they are on. Sometimes the words we use to describe them are insulting and patronising ('sweet', 'difficult', 'naughty'), as if being old made them children once more.

A couple of years ago, one of my daughters was taken to hospital with a minor head injury: she had fallen off a horse, was briefly unconscious, and when she came round she not only had no memory of what had happened, but also could not form new memories.

Four out of ten UK bosses perceive staff as old when their employees pass the age of 50

For a few hours (after which she recovered entirely), whatever we told her she promptly forgot, greeting the news with an identical expression of incredulity. She was caught in a small loop of time, which was remarkably similar to how people are with severe dementia. She was kept in overnight for observation, and because there were few beds available, she was taken to an orthopaedic ward where everyone happened to be very old, and where all but one had some kind of dementia.

It was night time; the lighting was dim, and all round us were shadowy shapes of women in states of distress and confusion.

One kept crying out, like a child wanting its parents, and another was loudly and obscenely rude to the nurses. To my shame, I felt scared. The nurses were kind and respectful to their patients, but the room seemed full of pain and even a kind of torment.

The next morning, with daylight making everything seem saner and less threatening, I saw it differently. The women were sitting up in bed. They talked, smiled. One was reading a book.

Nicci wants people to be defined by who they are, not by how old they are

They were fellow humans, individuals, women with long and richly complicated histories who needed to be recognised and cherished for all the selves they held inside them. We all need to be recognised. To become invisible is to be like a ghost in our own life. We are our life's work and only at the very end can we gather together all these selves and know what we have made of ourselves.

A few years ago, I trained to be a humanist celebrant: I conduct funerals for people who have no religious faith. I did it just as my children were leaving home and I had a powerful sense of a long chapter of my life being over.

I became preoccupied with leavings and farewells. How do you say goodbye to someone you dearly love and will never see again, and how do you find comfort? You find comfort through memory.

At a good funeral, the story is over and a life is pieced together. The body in the coffin was a daughter, a sister, a mother, a grandmother, a colleague, a lover, a friend. She was happy and she was sad; difficult and wonderful; loved and rejected. Now she is all these things. She is no longer old, nor is she young; she has become everything that she ever was.

I once conducted a funeral for a woman who'd had a rackety kind of life - she had married several times, had been a model and a waitress, lived in several countries, been restless.

She'd loved parties, adventures, excitement. There were only three at the service, including her carer. The empty chapel echoed with the dance music she had wanted.

But at most services there is a sense of a whole life being lit up by accumulated memories.

The coffin lies on the catafalque, but in the order of service there are often photographs: here is the dead person in a field of bluebells, here she is on her wedding day, or cradling her first baby. Day by day, we make up a life.

Several times, I have visited the person whose funeral I will conduct before they die. Close to the end, they want to meet the person who is to bury them.

I think, too, they want to tell the story of their life to a stranger who could acknowledge its uniqueness. This need to be seen whole and special is inside us all.

If we are lucky, we become old. But when we are old, we still have that need to be recognised, seen as who we are. Our selves.
