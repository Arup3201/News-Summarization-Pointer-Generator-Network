 The name conjures up images of row upon row of dusty leather-bound books in some darkened corner of a stately home.

But these days, it seems, you’re just as likely to find a ‘library’ in a three-bedroom suburban house.

The quiet allure of a room filled with books, a cosy chair in the corner and a lamp or two has become a new status symbol, estate agents say.

Status symbol: Many home owners are turning under-used rooms into quiet refuges from the modern world

 And getting your own library isn’t too difficult. Many homeowners are simply redecorating their under-used dining rooms, which have become redundant as more families use a combined kitchen-diner for meals.

Estate agents say a library is ‘aspirational’ and regarded as a retro retreat from the rest of our increasingly hi-tech homes.

One in ten said there had been a rise in the number of homes being advertised with a library, the National Association of Estate Agents found.

Yesterday, Mark Hayward, of the NAEA, said: ‘Having a library in your home can add a unique advantage when it comes to selling your property. It is a differentiator – a room by its very title that conveys peace, quiet and serenity that’s growing in popularity.

‘At the top-end property market, it adds a quintessential English touch, popular amongst overseas investors.’

It follows a trend for ‘shelfies’ – photographs of one’s bookshelves – which have become popular on social media websites. More than 160,000 images have been posted on the website Instagram using the hashtag ‘shelfie’, with thousands more on Twitter. 

 Mr Hayward said many upmarket new-build homes now included library rooms as standard, while sellers were converting their spare rooms.

He said: ‘The popularity of the kitchen-diner means many dining rooms are now dead space. Filling it with books and calling it a library elevates it again.

‘The books you put on the shelves are intended to reflect a lifestyle. It is filled with the books you want people to think you are reading.’

The name may evoke images of leather bound books and mahogany but libraries are increasingly common
