It is the wish list of a dying Australian man who, doctors say, has just weeks left on Earth.

Former corporate high-flyer Peter Short, 57, from Camberwell, Victoria, has terminal oesophageal cancer. 

Two weeks ago, he was told he has just 90 days to live.

But, in his own words, 'everyday's a ball' - and there's just three things he wants to do before he passes on. 

'That Bucket List movie did dying such a disservice,' he told Daily Mail Australia, referring to a 2007 comedy flick. 

'It's not about rushing around and trying to do all the bloody things you wanted. 'It's about being close to the people you're close to.'

Peter Short was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer five years ago. He recovered, but on January 28 this year doctors told him it had returned in a terminal form

He is going to tick off the first item on his list on Friday, when he goes for a drive down a windy road in his Porsche with his son, Mitchell, 27.

They will rip through the Black Spur line of road in Yarra Valley and go for a dip in the Elidon Weir. 'That'll be a great day,' Short told Daily Mail Australia. 

Another wish will be completed on February 1. That's Mitchell's first day of work in his graduate job. That evening, Peter wants to crack open a bottle of red with him.  

And then there is his final hope. He told a Senate inquiry last month he wants to have a 'magnificent' death - 'not... swallowing a whole lot of pills hoping it works and spitting them half back up'. 

But voluntary euthanasia - also known as voluntary assisted suicide - is not legal in Australia.

So as the final item on his bucket list, he wants to confront Prime Minister Tony Abbott about the Liberal Party's position against euthanasia.  

'I'm not going to die with a thing on the wish list,' Short told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday, the 14th day of the 90-day death sentence he was given by doctors.

'(But) if I'm going to die without Abbott having talked to me I would consider that a major failure for him as well as me.' 

Short wants to press Mr Abbott to consider a conscience vote on the issue - something that was recommended by a Senate committee early in November.

A former executive at Coles and Shell, Short is the subject of a new documentary, Fade to Black, which concerns his fight for voluntary euthanasia in Australia.

He has helped raised more than $100,000 for the film. 

In the trailer of his forthcoming documentary, Short says: 'I will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog Missy's ears in my hands and my family by my side'

On Friday, Short will ride in his Porsche through the Black Spur line of road to a freshwater dam in the Yarra Valley. There, he will paddle with his son

'I will go out of my wonderful life at a time of my choosing with my dog Missy's ears in my hands and my family by my side,' he said in the film's trailer. 

There are parallels between his situation and that of Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old US woman who killed herself as her body began to succumb to the ravages to brain cancer. 

Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner.

In some parts of the world, including Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the US states of Oregon and Washington, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal.

In 1996 in Australia the Northern Territory passed the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996.

Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, but the legislation was overturned by Australia's Federal Parliament in 1997. 

Short said he felt like a friend had died when Ms Maynard died last month.

'We're the two souls who, for whatever reason, have found themselves in similar spots,' he explained to Daily Mail Australia. 

Ms Maynard went on an extensive media campaign to promote voluntary euthanasia prior to her death. 

She tearfully told CBS News: 'I don't want to die. 

'If anyone wants to hand me a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.'

'Anyone who has walked a mile in my shoes and knows what they're facing and has felt the just bone-splitting headaches I get sometimes or the seizures or the inability to speak or the moments when I'm looking at my husband's face and I can't remember his name...'

Despite his tragic condition - the cancer has metastasised in his lungs - Short told Daily Mail Australia: 'I can do something good at the end of my life. 

'It's great leadership for my son. And, you know, everyday's a ball.'

Over the past year, he has had a stream of farewell events with family and friends where he has said a 'little speech' - but he has lived to tell the tale. 

'You never know what's around the next corner,' he said. 'It's always another exciting something happening.

'Sooner or later, I'm going to turn around a corner and say 's*** it looks like it's all coming to an end.'

His main fear is not death, but rather the pain he and his family will experience. Short hopes to live until the end of February.
