A Turkish barman who ran off with a British schoolgirl will not spend even one night behind bars after the teenager refused to press charges against him.

Faye Jones, 16, met Murat Can Ertani, 
22, while on a family holiday in the resort of Marmaris and ran away with him just a few hours before she was due to return to the UK with her mother.

The pupil was yesterday found by police after four days on the run hitch-hiking across the mountainous Turkish countryside with the barman and was reunited with her distraught mother Rhonda, 39.

Freed: Murat Can Ertani, pictured left, has been released by police without charge after going on the run in Marmaris with 16-year-old schoolgirl Faye Jones, pictured right, who was yesterday reunited with her mother

All smiles: Murat Can Ertani smiles as he is released from a police station after being quizzed by police

But despite giving a detailed statement to police, the schoolgirl refused to make a complaint against Ertani - insisting he'd done nothing wrong.

She told Turkish police officers: 'He shouldn't go to jail. He did nothing wrong. It was my fault for running away.'

A Turkish police source confirmed: 'Murat Can Ertani was arrested and questioned in relation to abducting Faye Jones.

'However, he claimed she went of her own free will and that he didn't know she was underage. Her statement supports his and so we had no alternative than to release him after questioning.'

Faye's other Rhonda said she was disappointed 
not to see Ertani jailed.

The chip shop worker from Newcastle went 
without food or sleep for four days as she carried out a one woman vigil
- trawling the streets of Marmaris for any sign of her missing child.

Tearful reunion: The moment Faye Jones, 16, was finally reunited with her mother Rhonda Jones at Mugla Police Station after she went missing with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani

Smiles all round: Faye, who was sunburned and had insect bites and scratches on her legs, was given a translator so she could give an account of her four-day ordeal

More than 30 Turkish police officers were put on the case and the family put missing person posters up around the resort

Rhonda said: 'I'd hoped he would be 
locked up and no longer a danger to Faye or any other English 
schoolgirls - but there's nothing I can do about it.

'At the end of day I'm just relieved to have Faye home safe and sound,' she added.

It comes after it emerged Ms Jones was not the first British schoolgirl Ertani has allegedly seduced.

Alanah Longshaw claims Murat Can Ertani groomed her via Facebook, told her 
he loved her and persuaded her to leave her mother and move in with him 
in Turkey three years ago.

Alanah
was 16 when she decided to give up her life in Scotland to go and live 
with him and his family in the village of Adana just outside Marmaris in
January 2011.

Found: Schoolgirl Faye Jones (right) ran off with Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani (left) who
she met on holiday last year

Located: Faye was found with Can about an hour away from the resort where she went missing. She was taken to Mulga police station

But after she 
fell pregnant with his child, the 22-year-old told 
her 'I hope you and the baby die in labour'. She is now back living in Scotland.

Speaking from her home in Scotland, Alanah said: 'We lived in an empty apartment block with no electricity. Can would lock me in at night and often come back drunk in the early hours of the morning.

'If I dared to ask where he'd been he would often lose his temper and slap and punch me.

'I stayed because I believed I was in love with him - even in those dire conditions. I finally wised up and came home.

'I haven't seen him since and he's never seen his son and I doubt he ever will.

'The last message I had from him was to say he'd washed his hands of our baby and wanted nothing to do with him as he had a s*** for a mother,' she added.

Faye, right, and Rhonda Jones were reunited 35 miles away from Marmaris where the 16-year-old went missing
