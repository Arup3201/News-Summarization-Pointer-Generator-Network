A mother accused of trying to kill her autistic daughter has today pleaded guilty to first-degree child abuse.

Kelli Stapleton entered the plea on Tuesday morning in northern Michigan. Stapleton had been scheduled to go on trial on Wednesday on a charge of attempted murder.

Benzie County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Tang-Anderson said no sentencing date was set. The maximum punishment for the charge is life in prison.

Stapleton, 46, is accused of trying to kill herself and her teenage daughter on September 3, 2013 by carbon monoxide poisoning by igniting charcoal grills inside a van.

Isabelle, known as Issy, was 14 at the time. She has severe autism and sometimes has violent outbursts.

Stapleton's blog had chronicled the challenges her family faced while caring for her.

In July, Stapleton's estranged husband, Matt Stapleton, said he will never be able to forgive his wife for attempting to kill their now 15-year-old daughter.

Mr Stapleton, from Elberta, said that raising Issy was hard and at one point brought the couple to 'a cracking point,' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures.

'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he told People magazine.

Issy was diagnosed as autistic at two years old, and barely slept until the age of eight when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest.

However, when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school, 'just for the safety of the other kids,' Mr Stapleton said during an interview last month.

However the attacks continued at home. Mrs Stapleton was twice left unconscious by Issy's fits and her younger sister Ainsley, 13, hid in her room to avoid outbursts.

The father said the family was at a complete loss as to what to do next.

'If somebody would have called me (then) and said this horrible thing had happened, I would not have been okay with it, but I would have understood it,' he told People magazine.

The family finally got Issy into a residential autism treatment center in January 2013. The program made the teenager calmer and was helping to teach her how to control her fiery temper.

Issy attended the Great Lake Center for Autism Treatment in Potage for seven months. Mrs Stapleton acted just days after Issy was released.

She allegedly told her daughter they were going on a camping trip and then lit two charcoal grills in the van they were in with the windows up.

Both survived after being found unconscious.

After 17 years of marriage, Mr Stapleton filed for divorce, partly to show a welfare agency how he's determined to protect Issy and his two other children.
