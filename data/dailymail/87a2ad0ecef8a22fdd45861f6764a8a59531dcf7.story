A third of children in the UK aged between ten and 13 do not know that Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus, according to a survey.

What’s more, half the population considers Jesus’s birth irrelevant to their festive celebrations, while only one adult in ten can correctly state four facts about the Nativity.

Critics claim the research shows schools are becoming too politically correct and are not putting on Nativity plays for fear of offending people of different religions.

Francis Goodwin, of campaign group Christmas Starts With Christ, which commissioned the survey, said: ‘Britain is fast becoming one of the world’s most secular countries. 

As nations get richer, they think they no longer need God and may only come back to him in a crisis.’

He added: ‘There is a problem with political correctness in schools. They think they should not focus on the Christian roots of Christmas because of inclusivity. 

'But it is misguided. People of other faiths are not offended.

'In a multi-faith, inclusive society, children can learn about the Muslim festival Eid, for example, as well as Christmas.’

Christmas Starts With Christ surveyed 2,000 families. 

Their campaign is supported by the Bible Society, Church of England and Methodist Church.
