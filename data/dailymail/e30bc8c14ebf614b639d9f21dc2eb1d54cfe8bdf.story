Kristen Stewart has cheated on Robert Pattinson with a married filmmaker twice her age, it has been claimed.

The Twilight actress, 22, is said to have enjoyed an affair with Snow White And The Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, 41.

As Kristen prepared to spread her wings from the vampire franchise, she joined forces with the father-of-two to work on his $170m feature debut - which was released just last month.

Wife Liberty Ross, 33, played Queen Eleanor - Stewart's mother in the box office hit.

Infidelity? Us Weekly have claimed to have photographic proof that Kristen Stewart cheated on boyfriend Robert Pattinson

It has been reported that last Tuesday, Kristen was 
caught in the arms of Rupert - with celebrity magazine Us Weekly claiming to have 
photographic evidence.

Kristen can be seen wrapped in the arms of a man alleged to be Sanders on the cover of this week's issue of the American magazine.

In another snap, Rupert appears to nestle into Kristen's shoulder, even nibbling or offering a kiss as they were captured at Pacific View Trail - a lookout point with a view of the Hollywood sign.

A series of shots sees the pair caught in an embrace as the smiling actress leans against a ledge, while clutching her baseball cap, with Rupert gravitating towards her with open arms.

But perhaps the most unsettling pictures are those taken from inside a parked car, where Stewart and Sanders seem to be kissing.

While the brunette's face is turned from the camera, her hairstyle and profile resemble the real K-Stew, with her white tank top and neon yellow bra strap showing, as in the other pictures.

Kristen's head is tilted as Rupert's eyes are closed and their heads come together.

As they drive away, Kristen puts her baseball cap back on and both cover their faces in shades.

A photographer told Us Weekly: 'He was all over her. (They) would only take a break when they thought someone was walking by. It seemed like they couldn't get enough.'

It is believed Kristen may have avoided being photographed if not for the timing of a phone call.

While driving back to her $6m Los Feliz home, that she has shared with Pattinson since last September, she answered her mobile and headed off in the other direction.

It was then that a photographer followed her black Mini Cooper to 'the back lot of a deserted building plastered with For Lease signs' that he captured the couple.

And People.com also reported the story, saying: 'Kristen is absolutely devastated. It was a mistake and a
complete lapse in judgement. She wasn't having an affair with Rupert.

'It was just a fleeting moment that 
shouldn't have happened. She never meant to hurt anyone. She's a good 
person who just made a bad choice.'

Insiders have made the allegations to both Us Weekly and celebrity website People.com.

Kristen's alleged infidelity came just months after Robert gave an interview to Italian Vanity Fair magazine saying that he has 'never understood' people who cheat.

He said: 'There is one thing I've never understood: Why people cheat. 
My parents met when my mom was 17 and my father 25, they are still 
together, and seem very happy.

'I grew up believing that you can be 
together all of your life.'

While it is unknown exactly how 
long the Twilight pair have been dating, due to extreme privacy at
the start their romance, R-Patz finally came clean at the BAFTAs
ceremony in February 2010.

At the time, the 26-year-old told The Sun: 'It is extremely difficult but we are together, yes. We can't arrive at the same time because of the fans. It goes crazy.

'This
was supposed to be a public appearance as a couple but it's impossible.
We are here together and it's a public event but it's not easy. We have
to do all this stuff to avoid attention.'

Just days ago, the duo looked happy at Comic-Con as they promoted the final film of their franchise, Breaking Dawn: Part 2, and also at the Teen Choice Awards on Sunday.

The news will come as a shock after British actor Pattinson hinted he wanted to marry Kristen.

Speaking to BlackBook, he explained: 'There was a magazine, with these pictures, saying I was getting married. No one ever knows what is true or what isn’t.

'Even my own mum called to ask me if it was true. It’s not. At least, not yet. But it is true that Kristen has always done something to me that others haven’t.'

And in her most recent interview, with the June issue of Elle magazine, Kristen said she was getting tired of her 'boring' life, and wanted something 'bad' to happen to her.

She said: 'You can learn so much from bad things. I feel boring. I feel like, "Why is everything so easy for me?" I can't wait for something crazy to f***ing happen to me. Just life.

'I want someone to f*** me over! Do you know what I mean?'

Meanwhile, Rupert's wife Liberty 
rather cryptically retweeted a quote from Marilyn Monroe, saying: 
'Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.'

She later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.'

Liberty then simply wrote: 'WOW'.

Following her tweets, Liberty appeared to have deleted her Twitter account.

When Kristen signed up to play Snow White in Huntsman, many thought that it would mark a new stage in her career following her role as Bella Swan in Twilight.

And speaking about his lead actress in the role at one of the movie's premieres last month, Rupert said he was thrilled by her performance.

He told E! News: 'She's got a great spirit, she's really quite rebellious...and feisty and kind of wild. And that's really what I wanted the modern Snow White to have.

'I didn't want her to be timid and I 
didn't want her to be frightened and relying on men, you know.

'She's 
very strong and very driven, and I think that's true in her personal 
life...She's got a big weight of the world on her shoulders and she 
carries it incredibly well.'

Snow
White And The Huntsman marks the first major motion picture that Rupert
directed - but he has already signed on to take the helm of the sequel.

He has said: 'Our story is a 'once upon a time', but it's not a "happy ever after."'

It is believed that Huntsman was the first in a planned trilogy of movies about the modern Snow White.

Prior to the film, Rupert had made a name for himself directing commercials.

Following the infidelity claims breaking, Kristen is already facing backlash from fans of the tween favorite couple.

One fan said: 'HOW COULD SHE? Rob loves her so much.'

Another told HollywoodLife.com: 'Ever
since she did Snow White And The Huntsman she changed. She’s more 
Hollywood now. More into her looks. I mean how many magazine covers she 
done in the past few months? I lost count.'

Others
took to Twitter to voice their disappointment in the actress, with one 
tweeting: ' OH HELLLLL NO. KRISTEN STEWART CHEATED ON MAH BEW WITH SOME 
DIRECTOR. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD TO ROBERT PATTINSON, his luscious 
self.'

And another added: 'Kristen Stewart, 
how could you cheat on Robert Pattinson with a married man that has 
children? So disappointed in you.'

In a bid to lose her wholesome image, Kristen also played the role of Emily in Adventureland in 2009.

The cheeky actress, who has disrobed 
for her latest project On The Road, engaged in sexual scenes with Ryan 
Reynolds, who played the married park maintenance man.
