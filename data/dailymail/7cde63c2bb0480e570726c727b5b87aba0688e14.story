They always win at football, grab the deckchairs, drive gleaming muscle cars and work in a seemingly recession-proof country - but Germans are incapable of enjoying life.

That is the finding of a study which says that the 'joy gene' in the Fatherland is broken.

Rheingold, a market-research and consultancy institute based in Cologne, found that 46 per cent of Germans say they are increasingly unable to enjoy anything due to the stress of everyday life and the feeling of being constantly reachable - on the phone, the iPad, the computer.

The difficulty was even more pronounced among the study's younger participants, 55 per cent claiming to feel they have lost their ability to 'feel good.'

Whether it's with food, alcohol, holidays or relaxing -- Germans don't have the capacity to enjoy things - they can't even let go when they're having sex.

According to the researchers; 'Our joy gene is increasingly defective - we've forgotten how to enjoy ourselves.'

The highly personal interviews revealed that Germans can't let go during sex with many saying they constantly have film and advertising images run through their minds.

'This results in the requirement to cut a good figure even during sex,' Imdahl says. 'That is to say, holding in their bellies instead of enjoying the moment.'

'The results conform to the image that many Europeans have of Germans in this era of economic crisis as self-denying overachievers who can't even turn off the fun-brakes when vacationing at the beach,' said news magazine Der Spiegel.

'The positive image that they enjoyed during the 2006 soccer World Cup in Germany seems gone.'

'At that time, Germans really radiated a zest for life,' says Rheingold psychologist Ines Imdahl. 'But this mood shifted beginning in 2008.

'The problem is that Germans feel weighed down by the ongoing European debt and currency crisis. It's more than simple complaining. People have the feeling that we have to shoulder the entire crisis here.'

The common currency, however, doesn't shoulder all the blame - the main thing standing in their way is their own perfectionism.

During hours of individual and group interviews, the researchers analysed how 60 subjects felt pleasure. They also surveyed 1,000 men and women.

Among survey respondents, 81 percent said that they experience pleasure best when they have managed to achieve something first.

'As the saying goes, business before pleasure,' said 61-year-old female participant Wiltrud.

But this maxim doesn't seem to serve the Germans well - they even feel burdened by the pressure to enjoy things.

'People often told us that they would come home after a stressful day, but were unable to even say what they'd accomplished,' Imdahl reported. 'And then the people around them say, "Hey, just relax." Enjoyment then turns into an obligation.'

Meanwhile the small pleasures of life - a glass of wine, a relaxing bubble bath, or a nice restaurant with delicious food - rankle with the Teutonic mind. 'This glut of offerings pressures people into thinking, 'I must enjoy everything',' Imdahl says.

During the course of the study, the researchers managed to unlock a typically German sequence of steps to enjoyment, which they named 'pleasure DNA.'

The first step involves the feeling of having earned something. This is followed by preparation for the longed-for pleasure, such as booking a day of spa treatments. But then comes the biggest hurdle: letting go and clearing the mind.

'Only when a surprising positive moment supervenes can a fully integrated sense of enjoyment follow,' said Imdahl.

'But many Germans apparently lack crucial components to this pleasure DNA. Though some 91 per cent of the study participants said that pleasure makes life worthwhile, only 15 percent could recall moments in which they were able to forget their worries and feel 'truly happy.'

And two thirds of those quizzed said happiness came at the expense of others - one motorbiker said he was 'delighted' when he blew exhaust fumes into an open topped car as he was stopped at traffic lights.

Jealously also floats their boat. 'Many think, "man, how does he do it",' psychologist Imdahl said.

'It's a Teutonic mentality one can also see in the euro crisis. When we get agitated about the Greeks' high pensions and ample vacation days, naturally pleasure-jealousy plays a role,' she says. 'But Germans don't want to actually be Greeks. That wouldn't suit us.'
