Chelsea are preparing for a sudden flurry of offers for Petr Cech amid fears he is losing his duel with Thibaut Courtois to be first-choice goalkeeper.

Jose Mourinho has insisted he will not reveal before Sunday who will start their opening game at Burnley on Monday night.

Neither has been given any indication but Courtois appears confident of getting the nod after playing for 90 minutes in a friendly against Real Sociedad on Tuesday.

Cech, the No.1 since he arrived from Rennes a decade ago, seems less certain and will have to consider his future if Mourinho opts for the young Belgian. Both have two years left on their contracts.

Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are keen to lure Cech back to France. Real Madrid are also interested and all three are ready to step up their pursuit.

Meanwhile, Courtois has been warned he must become  first-choice goalkeeper at Chelsea if he wants to continue as Belgium No 1. 

Despite choosing Courtois as Belgium's stopper for the World Cup in Brazil, national team coach Marc Wilmots has declared that the Chelsea man is not assured of his place if he cannot break into his club side. 

Wilmots said: 'Courtois will remain my No 1. But I know he could end up on the bench at Chelsea.

'In that case I will re-assess.'
