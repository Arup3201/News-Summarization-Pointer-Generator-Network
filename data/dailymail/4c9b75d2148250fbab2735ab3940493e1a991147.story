Brave: Chantelle Pringle, from Barmston, Tyne and Wear, was just two years old when she had her right foot amputated and all the toes on her left removed

A girl has won a '£1million payout' after she had amputations on both feet because a nurse failed to realise she was suffering from meningitis - and instead, prescribed her Calpol. 

Chantelle Pringle, from Barmston, Washington, Tyne and Wear, was just two years old when her mother Keeley Grotz, 33, rang the out-of-hours medical phone line for advice.

She told a duty nurse her daughter was lethargic, short of breath, wobbly and vomiting - and was advised to give the toddler Calpol and call back if she was still concerned.

But Chantelle, now 11, deteriorated rapidly - and by the time she got to hospital, the bacterial blood infection septicaemia had taken hold.

Days later, surgeons were forced to amputate her right foot and all of the toes on her left.

Today, Chantelle was awarded compensation after a High Court judge ruled the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange her immediate admission to hospital. 

Judge Michael Harvey QC told London's High Court that the company that 
ran the out-of-hours service, Nestor Prime Care Services Limited, was liable
 for the medic's blunder.

He added that if the schoolgirl had been treated earlier, her foot and toes would probably have been saved.

Although the amount of Chantelle's compensation has yet to be confirmed, her lawyers have valued her claim at about £1million.

Acting on behalf of the family, Lisa Sullivan previously told the court that Ms Grotz had called the NHS line operated by Nestor Primecare Services Ltd in the early hours of November 1, 2004.

She said the concerned mother had told the nurse that Chantelle was 'wobbly, vomiting and just not right', and had also been 'burning up'.

Miss Sullivan claimed the medic should have arranged for an emergency ambulance to be called - but instead, she prescribed Calpol, an over-the-counter paracetamol syrup.

During the night, Chantelle 'kept waking up' and her mother called an ambulance in the morning after she noticed blemishes on her legs, the court heard.

The toddler was then diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia - and spent eight days on life support in intensive care, where her hands and feet turned black.

However, she pulled through after surgeons removed her foot and toes.

Speaking at the time, Ms Grotz said: 'She came down with a temperature and was feeling a bit drowsy - I thought it was the flu.

Success: Although the amount of Chantelle's compensation has yet to be confirmed, her lawyers have valued her claim at about £1million. Above, Chantelle in 2008

'I called the emergency doctor and he said to leave her until the morning. Next day, I noticed she had a few spots.

'It took a couple of minutes for the ambulance to get here. I was shaking, but they took over. I didn't want to watch. I had to leave the bedside because it was touch and go.

'I didn't know anything about septicaemia. It wasn't until they put her on a life support machine that they told us.

'They told me if I had waited for an emergency doctor to come, she would have died.

'The first 48 hours were the most critical, whether she would pull through or not. It was just a matter of hoping she would.

'Her feet were really black and her hands were too. You could tell they were actually gone. Her hands were saved by all the stuff she was on - the nine machines around her.'

In a two-hour operation on December 6, surgeons removed Chantelle's right foot and five toes from her left. Her family remained at her bedside until she was allowed home on December 22.

Chantelle now has a false leg.

Judge Harvey QC said that, had the nurse correctly noted Chantelle's symptoms, Nestor Prime Care's computer system would have prompted her to call for an ambulance straight away.

He added that had Chantelle been admitted to hospital by about 1am that night - rather than more than 10 hours later - she would swiftly have been given antibiotics, and the double amputation would probably not have been necessary.

Nestor Prime Care admitted the nurse had been negligent in failing to arrange for a doctor to call at the family home.

But the firm disputes claims the medic should have called for an ambulance immediately - saying that if she had, it would have made no difference to the outcome.

The amount of Chantelle's compensation will be calculated at a further court hearing, unless final settlement terms are reached before then.
