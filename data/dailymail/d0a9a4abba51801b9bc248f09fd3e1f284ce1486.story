One of Sydney's most listened to shock-jocks has threatened to punch a former reporter in the face live on-air following a clash of opinions over Woolworths' 'racist' singlets.

2GB presenter Ray Hadley called former Fairfax columnist Mike Carlton a 'dog' and a 'grub' and threatened to 'put one on his chin' during his regular morning segment on Wednesday.

The shock-jock was responding to Mr Carlton's earlier tweet in which he had alluded to Hadley being a 'wife beater' after hearing of his support for the singlets.

'Funny to hear Ray 'Boofhead' Hadley ranting about that Woolies patriotic singlet. A garment sometimes known as a "wifebeater",' Carlton tweeted after hearing Hadley defending the garments on Tuesday.

Appearing on Channel Nine's Today Show on Tuesday, Hadley slamming Woolworths for removing the blue tank-tops, which were emblazoned with an Australian flag and the words 'if you don't like it, leave'.

'What's the big deal? It's not offensive: 'if you don't like it, leave'. I mean what's the problem,' he said on the show.

Later the same day, he clarified his position during his 2GB segment by saying he thought the shirts reflect 'a positive image' of 'team Australia'.

'If you reside here, if you're an Australian resident, or if you're an Australian citizen, then you love the joint,' he said.

'And if you don't love it, nick off. It's not racist; it's simply a fact of life.

The tweet was posted following Hadley slamming Woolworths for removing the pictured singlets from their store's shelves after they were deemed racist on social media 

'This is the best country in the world. If you don't embrace it you don't deserve to be here.'

Hearing the comments, Carlton took to social media with his offending tweet that alluded to Hadley as a 'wife beater'.

A furious Hadley then verbally attacked the former newspaper columnist on Wednesday morning dubbing the tweet ‘a low dog act by a low dog man’. 

'It's defamatory to call someone a grub but I think in this instance I could perhaps prove to a court that he is a grub,' Hadley said, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.

'No wonder Fairfax sacked you, no wonder you can't get a job anywhere you low dog. I've had a gutful of your sort of nonsense. How dare you describe me as a wife beater.'

The offending tweet: Carlton wrote this on Twitter after hearing Hadley say to his listeners: 'this is the best country in the world. If you don't embrace it you don't deserve to be here' in defence of the singlet's slogan 

He later added: 'Now Mr Carlton, if you wish to call me a wife beater do it in a public forum and you and I will be in the supreme court as quickly as we can and whatever assets you have, I'll be after. 

'If you ever wish to have a discussion with me personally I invite you to do it but of course when I put one on your chin, not a king hit, but when I put one on your chin you'd crawl off to the coppers and whinge your head off, you dog.'

Carlton clearly thought very little about the physical threat against him. In response to being notified via Twitter of Hadley's comments, he simply replied: 'Sorry I missed it. Hadley couldn't knock the froth off a schooner'.

The duo have are well known rivals in the media industry. 

Unaware of Hadley's violent threats towards him, Carlton was informed via Twitter of the slurs 

However his response indicated he was unconcerned  

Following Carlton's suspension and resignation from Fairfax media in August this year, Hadley gave a scathing speech during his segment in which he reflected on the former talk-host's career, calling him 'yesterday's man'.

He also claimed that Carlton had 'vilifeied' him during his career as well as 'called me names and taken to me on social media'. 

In 2013 Carlton appeared on ABC's Australian Story as a critic of Hadley, who was the prime subject of the television show. 

He later complained that his comments were edited to present a more positive image of the 2GB presenter.
