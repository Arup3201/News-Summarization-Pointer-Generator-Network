Samir Nasir was just 21 when he announced himself to his new Arsenal team-mates by taking Thierry Henry's usual seat on the France team coach and refusing to budge when the club's greatest-ever player told him to at Euro 2008.

When it comes to rubbing up people the wrong way, Nasri is world-class. But when he performs like he has done in City's last three games, it is a price managers consider worth paying.

Nasri, now 27, would say he's maturing. With high-profile fall-outs in the past with Sir Alex Ferguson, Didier Deschamps, Arsenal fans and French media, you'd hope so.

Samir Nasri scored a stunning opener for Manchester City in their Champions League win against Roma

Manuel Pellegrini's less confrontational style appears to suit Nasri just fine though.

As City have been forced to cope without their fab four Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Nasri is one of those who has thrived on the extra responsibility and a major reason the club have qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League and on Chelsea's shoulder at the top of the Premier League.

After a poor start to the season, Nasri stepped up a gear in the 4-1 win at Sunderland, playing a central No 10 role with such creativity, Silva wasn't missed.

He followed up with a man-of-the-match performance at the weekend when City beat Everton 1-0 and saved his best until Wednesday night when his wonder-strike opened the scoring in a 2-0 win in Roma which confirmed City's place among Europe's top 16 clubs.

Nasri compared the goal, his first of the season. in importance with his Capital One Cup final winner against Sunderland last season.

If City go on to achieve anything in Europe, it will be far more significant than that having looked down-and-out in the group stages after taking only two points from their opening four matches.

'It was a great strike, I should try it more,' smiled the Frenchman. 'In the past few weeks we have been back to our best and shown we are team. When Yaya, Kompany and Aguero are not there, I don't think any other team could do it. We have shown the world we are a big team.'

'It is always the way with City, we like to do it the hard way.'

Nasri (pictured on Wednesday) has started to consistently perform for the Premier League champions 

Doing it the hard way has always been Nasri's personal experience, too. Born and raised in the tough southern French city of Marseille, he says and does what he thinks.

Henry found that out when Nasri joined Arsenal. So did Arsene Wenger when Nasri decided to leave the club, so did Ferguson who was convinced Nasri would sign for Manchester United until they were gazumped by City.

A return of 23 goals in 144 games for City is not a high enough return for someone of the Frenchman's talent.

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini's cool attitude has helped Nasri rediscover his form

But the way he has stepped in for Silva has been stunning, to the extent that Pellegrini can't leave him out now.

His slide-rule pass for Aguero's second goal against Sunderland underlined his vision. His performance as a second striker behind Aguero against Everton showed his versatility. And his goal in Rome proves he can hit a ball when he wants to. His rising shot from an angle couldn't have been better placed as it crashed in via the inside of the post.

You'll never be able to take the controversy away from Nasri, whether it's swearing at the French media in a mixed zone at Euro 2012 or telling Arsenal fans they are 'stupid' to boo him because players don't feel the same loyalty to clubs as supporters.

Only this week, Nasri – who signed a five-year contract in the summer – warned he wouldn't stick around at City if the club didn't see him as an important part of their plans.

Given his recent form, there's not much chance of that.
