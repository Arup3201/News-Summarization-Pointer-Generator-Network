The investigation into the Brett Favre sexting scandal was deliberately drawn out by the NFL, the former manager of ex-hostess Jenn Sterger has alleged.

The former quarterback allegedly sent inappropriate messages and nude photographs to Miss Sterger, who was working as a New York Jets game-day hostess, in 2008.

The 44-year-old married NFL legend admitted leaving voicemails for Miss Sterger, but denied sending lewd selfies, and was fined $50,000 by the NFL for a 'failure to cooperate' with the investigation.

Now, Miss Sterger’s former manager Phil Reese is accusing the NFL of deliberately delaying the investigation in order to avoid a lawsuit and 'minimize the impact of any negative PR'.

‘Just like Brett Favre’s penis (allegedly), it wasn’t pretty. But unlike Brett Favre’s penis (allegedly), it was extremely long,’ he writes in a column on the investigation.

The alleged messages were to have been send in 2008 when both Miss Sterger and Mr Favre were employed by the New York Jets.

However, it was not until October 2010 that the ‘sexts’ emerged when website Deadspin posted a video that included text messages and voicemails allegedly left by the quarterback for Miss Sterger, including one in which he invites her to his hotel.

The video ended with several below-the belt photos - said to be of Favre - which were allegedly sent to Miss Sterger.

Miss Sterger denied leaking the messages, and cooperated fully with the investigation by the NFL, which was not concluded until the end of December.

The NFL claimed the investigation had been dragged out because of difficulties in setting up interviews with 'certain key individuals,' the complication of retrieving and reviewing electronic records.

However, Mr Reese, claims is was dragged out to avoid a lawsuit.

‘The statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit in New Jersey would have expired at the end of December 28th, 2010, two years from the last day of the 2008 season, when Favre and Sterger were both employed by the Jets,’ he writes in a column obtained by Page Six.

‘And when did the league announce their ruling? On December 29th, 2010.

‘All of the “investigating” that took place wasn’t because they wanted to properly enforce the personal conduct policy, but to gather as much information as possible so that the league could avoid liability and minimize the impact of any negative PR that could tarnish the shield.

Miss Sterger appears in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos in 2011 where she denied accusations that she was a 'gold-digger', and claimed that she made no financial profit from the 2010 scandal

‘The league’s personal conduct policy has nothing to do with a player’s actual conduct and everything to do with protecting the league’s business interests.’

Following their investigation, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell 'could not conclude' that Favre violated the league's personal conduct policy based on the evidence currently available to him.

A statement released after the ruling said: 'The forensic analysis could not establish that Favre sent the objectionable photographs to Sterger.

'The review found no evidence to contradict the statements of both Favre and Sterger that they never met in person, nor was there anything to suggest that Sterger engaged in any inappropriate conduct.'

Favre, a grandfather-of-one, retired in 2010 after 20 years in the NFL, having played quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, New York Jets, and Minnesota Vikings.
