A food chain has unveiled a sugar-laden milkshake with as many calories as a typical Sunday roast.

Nutritionists branded the concoction from Krispy Kreme a ‘calorie explosion’.

The strawberry and cream version contains 612 calories – more than a quarter of a woman’s daily allowance and almost as much as a 650-calorie roast chicken dinner.

A chocolate dream shake with cream and flakes comes in at 555 calories, while a honeycomb and chocolate-topped caramel crunch has 508.

A coffee Kreme shake with espresso, cream and chai powder weighs in at 446 calories, but the simple strawberry milkshake outdoes them all at a worrying 800 calories.

Emma Conroy, of Edinburgh Nutrition, said: ‘Nobody would regard Krispy Kreme as anything other than an indulgent treat. 

'There will people who consume it too frequently. 

Krispy Kreme, which has hundreds of doughnut kiosks and store counters across Britain, was founded in the US in 1937

'At least when you eat a burger there is protein and other beneficial things. Whereas in a calorie explosion like this there are few nutritional benefits.’

Miss Conroy recommended that fruit should be consumed in solid form, because juice does not have as many health benefits as was once believed.
