A snowboarder traveling through an ice tunnel on Oregon's Mount Hood with five companions was found dead nearly 14 hours after the passageway collapsed on top of him.

The man trapped beneath the snow was identified today by authorities as Collin Backowski, 25, a professional snowboarder from Pines, Colorado.

Rescuers spent two days trying to dig Backowski out from under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice.

Collin Backowski, a 25 year-old snowboarder, was buried alive under snow and ice on Mt. Hoot in Oregon after a passageway collapsed on him

It took a crew of 12 people hours to dig out Backowski's body, according to KATU.com. The rescuers had to remove several dense tons of debris from the cave in spot by hand, authorities said in a release, the website reported.

Backowski was described by friends as 'an extremely nice and giving person who is always the life of the party,' according to EveryJoe.com.

In 2012 Backowski snowboarded as part of the Never Summer Industries team, a Colorado-based snowboard and long board manufacturer.

In his profile on the company's website Backowski wrote, 'I love everything about snowboarding, Nothing better than riding with your hommies at your favorite spots.'

The five other unidentified men traveling 
with the Backowski, ranging from ages 24-29, according to OregonLive.com, were uninjured and called police. They also attempted
to dig their friend out, but were unable to break through thick snow 
and ice.

Grant Giller, one of the five companions told KATU the group went up the mountain to scout locations to take pictures.

'Two days ago I went and scouted a crevasse to jump over,' Giller said. 'One of the kids up there is a professional snowboarder like 
myself. Two of the guys up there I know are photographers. So we were 
just going to take some photos.'

Backowski was traveling on the mountain with five friends who called authorities once the passage collapsed

Friends say that Backowski is the 'life of the party.' The young snowboarder was trapped as of 4pm Saturday

Seven rescuers, including five members of
an all-volunteer group called the CragRats responded immediately, but 
had to halt their attempt around 11pm as weather conditions would not 
permit them to continue.

Warm
temperatures made snow on the mountain slushier and more easily 
sloughed off the surface, adding to the challenge of attempting to reach
the snowboarder.

‘They tried digging for an hour, but the problem is the stuff is so thick that they couldn't get through it,’ said Hood River Sheriff's Office Sgt. Pete Hughes. ‘We're getting chainsaws, if that's any indication.’

Collin Backowski worked in 2012 as a professional snowboarder representing the Never Summer Team out of Colorado

According to the five other young men with him Backowski was hit by a chunk of ice as big as a school bus

Rescue crews were sent back to the mountain at dawn this morning to resume efforts to find Backowski (pictured here in happier times) under better weather conditions

Backowski's companions  took pictures of the area just before the tunnel collapsed, Hughes 
said, giving searchers a better idea of where to search.

An airplane was dispatched to survey the area, along with crews from local sheriff's offices.

Earlier reports from police incorrectly stated there were seven people in the group. The initial reports also referred to an avalanche, but it was not immediately clear if one had occurred.

Pete Hughes, public information officer with the Hood River County Sheriff's Office, told reporters rescuers had to use chainsaws in their attempts to free the trapped snowboarder

The accident took place at around 4pm when the climber got trapped by a collapsed tunnel on the White River Glacier, which begins about 6,000 feet up the south side of the mountain.

Officials told OregonLive.com the man was about 30-40 feet ahead of his companions when the tunnel collapsed and he was struck by a chunk of ice the side of a school bus.

‘It trapped one person in the tunnel, (but) we're not sure if he was the last one out or it just caught him,’ Hughes said. ‘It sounds like there's a significant amount of ice and snow that fell.’

Hughes said it will ‘take some doing’ to reach the area where the climber was buried on the White River Glacier, which begins about 6,000 feet up the south side of the mountain.

According to Hughes, it is unclear at what elevation the avalanche buried the climber. Rescuers will have to use chainsaws to cut through the ice.
