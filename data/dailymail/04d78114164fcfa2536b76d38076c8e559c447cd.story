There are the first pictures of a Jewish soldier's letter home written on Adolf Hitler's own personalised stationery.

Danny Jacobson was a 26-year-old Army sergeant when he was among half a dozen administrative clerks from the 179th Infantry sent to occupy a Munich flat at the end of the Second World War.

But this was not just any flat. It was one of the many homes used by the Hitler and his girlfriend Eva Braun, and was stocked with the Nazi Fuhrer's very own swastika-emblazoned letter paper.

Irony: Danny Jacobson holds a copy of his letter written on Hitler's stationery, with a photo of himself in Army uniform. He found the stationery in an abandoned flat in Munich at the end of the Second World War

And so, on May 6, 1945, then-Sergeant Jacobson began a letter to his new wife back home in Muskogee, Oklahoma, with these words: 'Dearest Julia,

'And so, Hitler's treasured stationery has come to this. Imaging how many times he would turn in his grave if he knew a Jew was writing on his precious personal stationery.'

Mr Jacobson's 70-year-old letter, penned just six days after Hitler's suicide, is now kept for posterity in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.

The Miami Herald reports that it is now being treated by museum conservators ahead of a possible inclusion in a forthcoming exhibition of Americans in the Holocaust.

Teresa Pollin, a curator at the museum, told the paper the significance of the letter is contained within its first line. 'It's quite unusual and ironic that he, being a Jewish soldier, is using Hitler's stationery,' she said.

But its importance proved more difficult to prove to Mr Jacobson himself, who reportedly still can't understand why there is such a fuss about it.

'It’s just a letter. I must’ve sent 20 others on that stationery,' he told the Herald's Ana Veciana Suarez. Thankfully for posterity's sake, his son Joe Jacobson, a doctor at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer institute, disagreed.

'I had held onto the letter for the past 20 years, pretty much out of sight all that time,' said Dr Jacobson. 'But I realised the letter was an artifact and I was afraid it would get lost somehow.

'I was nervous about holding on to it.'

Mr Jacobson was drafted in autumn 1940 and spent most of the war as an administrative clerk as his division fought seven major campaigns from Africa to Germany.

It was the dying days of the war in Europe when he and his fellow admins were ordered to go to the block of flats in Munich, a city that had been devastated by RAF carpet bombing.

He soon realised where he was, he remembered to the Herald, but did not consider it a particularly big deal. 'We were just doing our job,' he said.

But it would have been an intensely personal job for Mr Jacobson, whose Jewish peers in Europe suffered mass extermination had the hands of the Nazi regime.

An estimated 11million people were killed in the Nazi genocide, more than half of whom were Jews and including an estimated one million Jewish children.
