A Staten Island judge ruled Monday that he would hear arguments later this month on whether to release grand jury records in the case of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who died after a police officer put him in a chokehold.

After an unusually lengthy session lasting nine weeks, the grand jury voted in December not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner’s death on a Staten Island sidewalk last summer.

Captured on video, Garner's repeated cries of ‘I can't breathe!’ as Pantaleo holds him by his neck have become a rallying cry for protesters at demonstrations across the US who accuse police forces of being hostile towards people of color.

Powerful message: Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner, walks away from a State Supreme Court following a Monday hearing about whether or not to unseal the grand jury records in connection with the arrest and death of her son

Wheels of justice: Judge William Garnett agreed Monday to hear oral arguments concerning the release of the sealed records January 29  

Demand: A protester displays a placard calling for transparency during a demonstration outside the courthouse in Staten Island Monday 

The New York Civil Liberties Union, the city's public advocate, the Legal Aid Society and the New York Post have each filed petitions to unseal the records in the case 

The groups asking for the grand jury transcripts to be made public say they are expecting a tough legal battle in a case that has drawn the attention of President Barack Obama and his Justice Department.

But, they say, it is important to show how the grand jury came to its conclusion, and possibly expose flaws in the secrecy-shrouded process.

Grand jury proceedings, which are led by the prosecutor, are secret by law. The New York Civil Liberties Union, the city's public advocate, the Legal Aid Society and the New York Post have each filed petitions in State Supreme Court in Staten Island arguing that an exception should be made in the Garner case.

Deceased: The grand jury voted in December not to indict officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in Garner’s death

Justice William Garnett ruled Monday that the four petitioners demanding the release of the records will present their oral arguments January 29.

The hearing at the State Supreme Court in Staten Island was attended by Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, who showed up wearing a sweatshirt bearing her son's last words, 'I can't breathe.'

'I would like transparency to see what actually happened with my son,' Miss Carr said.

Outside the courthouse, a small group of protesters braved the frigid temperatures, waving homemade signs and calling on the grand jury records to be unsealed.

‘Millions of people saw that video, know that there were no indictments and now wonder what did the grand jury do and how did they do it,’ protester Bill Dobbs told CBS 2. ‘That’s why it’s critical to release these grand jury records.’

The grand jury system has come under renewed scrutiny with the cases of Garner and of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager killed by a white police officer last August in Ferguson, Missouri.

In the Brown case, a St. Louis County grand jury voted in November not to indict the officer, Darren Wilson, for killing Brown.

In both cases, protesters and some elected officials were angered that there would be no public trials, sparking a new wave of street rallies in recent weeks.

Donna Lieberman, the NYCLU's executive director, said overcoming the presumption of secrecy will be an uphill fight.

‘We are all concerned about the failure of a secret process to provide any vehicle for accountability in the case of Eric Garner,’ Lieberman said. ‘It has raised serious questions about the ongoing viability of the grand jury process as it is currently structured.’

In the case in Ferguson, the county prosecutor decided to publicly release most of the transcripts from the proceedings and evidence he presented to the grand jury.

Daniel Donovan, Jr., the district attorney who handled the Garner case, has said New York's law is tougher than in Missouri, although a judge allowed him to say how many witnesses were called and whether or not they were civilians.
