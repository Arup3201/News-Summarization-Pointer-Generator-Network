They first made an appearance at the Epsom Derby in June 2011 and then again at Prince Philip’s 90th birthday. We have seen them at Zara Phillips’s wedding and at the Queen's Coronation service last year.

And now they have been spotted on the Royal tour down under as Kate, 32, chose her favourite £185 nude LK Bennett heels for a day of engagements in Sydney.

It seems that the Duchess of Cambridge can't get enough of the 'go with everything heels'... and neither can we.

She just can't get enough! The Duchess of Cambridge snapped up her LK Bennett nude court shoes three years ago but they're still a wardrobe staple, as she proves on her arrival in Sydney - and she's helping sales soar

The Kate effect has seen sales of £12 nude heels at George at Asda increase by 126 per cent this week following the unveiling of the Royal Tour wardrobe.

In fact, following Kate's sophisticated 
lead, patent court shoes sales in all colours are up 76 per cent as women 
use them to smarten up day-to-day outfits as well as occasion dresses 
and skirts.

A George at Asda spokesperson said: 'Nude shoes are a classic wardrobe staple and a sophisticated addition 
to all outfits.

'Whether you’re at work, dinner or play they can be used
 to dress up jeans, skirts and dresses and as Kate has shown us this 
week they look the part on all occasions. Now that the summer is coming,
 we expect sales of nude shoes and tights to continue right through the 
season.

'Our shoppers love Kate Middleton and are always keen to emulate 
her smart yet fashion forward style, we can’t wait to see what she’ll be
 wearing next.'

Kate's LK Bennett shoes are used to travelling, on tour in 
Canada and the U.S. in 2012, she was seen in them six times.  

Box fresh: Seen on June 4, 2011 on  Derby Day at Epsom racecourse (l) and June 12, 2011 at Philip’s 90th birthday in Windsor (r)

Two in blue: Worn on July 2, 2011: In Ottawa on her Canadian tour (l) and July 3, 2011 in Quebec (r)

Despite their four-inch heel, they must be comfortable. While The Queen asks her dresser Angela Kelly to break in shoes for her, Kate clearly has no need of such a service.

And it seems that Kate's in good company; Samantha Cameron has the same pair in black.
