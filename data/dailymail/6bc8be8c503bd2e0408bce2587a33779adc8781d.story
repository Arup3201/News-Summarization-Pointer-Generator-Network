Chelsea will be without the talismanic Diego Costa for Saturday's title showdown with Manchester City after he was slapped with a three-match ban for violent conduct.

The Spain striker was found guilty of stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can during the Capital One Cup semi-final win at Stamford Bridge earlier in the week.

Costa was charged by the FA on Wednesday evening and unsuccessfully contested that decision, with Chelsea claiming that he wasn’t looking where he planted his feet and caught Can completely by accident.

Jose Mourinho will have to make-do without Costa for the Premier League games against Aston Villa and Everton following Manchester City.

It was not a surprise but it is still a bitter blow for Jose Mourinho to lose the case and be without his 17-goal top-scorer for three big games.

His absence is magnified by the fact he also has midfielder Cesc Fabregas struggling with a hamstring injury. Fabregas came off when he detected the problem during the Liverpool game.

The Blues boss is insistent that there is a 'campaign' against his club, cancelling the weekly pre-match press conference scheduled for Friday morning.

Mourinho claimed the incident, which occurred in front of the dugouts but was missed by the match officials, was 'absolutely accidental'.

It was subsequently reviewed on video by referee Michael Oliver, with the charge following on Wednesday as part of the FA's fast-tracked procedures.

Costa contested the charge on Thursday, but on Friday was found guilty and immediately banned.

A FA statement read: 'Diego Costa will serve a three-match suspension with immediate effect after a charge of violent conduct against him was found proven by an independent regulatory commission today (Friday, January 30, 2015).

'The Chelsea forward had denied the charge in relation to an on-field incident involving Liverpool's Emre Can which occurred in the 12th minute of the League Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, January 27, 2015.

'The incident was not seen by the match officials but caught on video.'

Jose Mourinho has fiercely defended Costa, insisting the stamping incident was 'accidental'

Costa took part in full training but Cesc Fabregas was a notably absentee for the Blues

Mourinho is in full siege mode ahead of the title clash with champions City at Stamford Bridge, on Saturday, claiming there is an anti-Chelsea agenda fuelled by Sky. 

The club is standing firm in support of Costa because they feel the aggressive elements of his game have been unfairly high-lighted and scrutinised through the season.

These erupted during the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool, a game broadcast live on Sky Sports, with Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp on duty in the analysis team.

Chelsea were not impressed to see 'Costa's Crimes' listed on Sky Sports, referring to flashpoints from the game.

Mourinho seems convinced Redknapp, a former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder, has it in for Chelsea, and that Sky, who also happen to pump millions into the sport, pushed the FA towards the charge by looping repeats of Costa's challenge on Can, and other clashes with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard.

There are parallels to a storm which erupted in October 2005, after a tackle by Michael Essien on Didi Hamann during a Champions League game at the Bridge, which was not punished by the referee but later the subject of a two-match ban from UEFA.

Hamann claimed it was the worst tackle he'd suffered in his career, but Mourinho blamed Sky for UEFA's intervention because they replayed the footage so much and refused to do interviews with them for a while. Chelsea were without Essien for both legs of their tie against Barcelona and were beaten on aggregate.

It is not the first time Mourinho has mentioned the 'campaign'. He was fined £25,000 for public comments after a game at Southampton claiming officials were being influenced by it. He was also warned about comments made regarding the need for a 'strong referee' before a game at Stoke.

During last season, his first back in England, he was in trouble with the FA. He was fined £8,000 for going on the pitch during a stormy defeat at Aston Villa, when Ramires and Willian were sent off and was fined £10,000 for sarcastic remarks about referees' boss Mike Riley after a defeat at home to Sunderland during which his assistant Rui Faria was sent off and banned for six games.

Mourinho was also fined £8,000 after he was ordered from the touchline during a home win against Cardiff for an outburst about time-wasting by the visitors.
