A high-speed powerboat inspired by First World War biplanes has become the world's first to 'fly' above the water on futuristic hydrofoils.

The makers of the wFoil Albatross claim it can hit speeds of 60mph thanks to its unique design, which lifts the boat clear of the water.

Rather than being driven by an underwater propeller like other boats, it is pulled along by an aeroplane rotor.

A high-speed powerboat inspired by First World War biplanes has become the world's first to 'fly' above the water on futuristic hydrofoils

It's also claimed the boat is one of the most environmentally friendly powerboats in the world because of its minimal drag.

Length: 570cm

Width: 740cm

Height: 390cm

Weight: 350 kg

Expected top speed: 50 knots (58mph)

Cost: £200,000

The small but constant amount of drag is achieved using a specially designed hydrofoil, which is a wing-like structure mounted on struts below the hull of a boat. This lifts it out of the water during forward motion.

It is the first hydrofoiling personal powerboat ever to go on sale on the open market, but potential buyers will have to spend a staggering £200,000 if they want one.

The wFoil Albatross is the result of professional pilot and engineer Tomaz Zore's 10-year bid to design ‘the ultimate joy machine’.

Mr Zore, 48, from Slovenia, said: ‘I wanted to create a machine that would show all the magic of flying to anybody, even without a pilot license.

‘The question of how to combine the sky and the ocean - flying and sailing - into one unique experience would keep me awake at night.

‘That is how the next big thing on the water, the wFoil concept, was born.

Mr Zore said the design of the wFoil Albatross was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the First World War. A Sopwith F-1 'Camel' from the time is pictured

The hull of the two-seater 18ft boat is handcrafted from mountain spruce, while its foils are made from carbon fibre and its rotor blade is aeronautical-grade aluminium.

Mr Zore said the design of the wFoil Albatross was inspired by the era of biplanes beginning with the First World War.

‘Those years in aviation meant the years of freedom, where you could just seat in the plane, start the engine and fly away,’ he said.

‘There were no air traffic controls, flight plans or millions of regulations. There was just you, the aeroplane and freedom.

‘The same goes for the Albatross. There is no pilot license needed - you just start the engine and fly low above the water.’

Mr Zore is also planning a sailing version of the Albatross with which he hopes to challenge the world record for the fastest wind-powered boat

He claims that his boat is the first hydrofoil motor boat available on the market.

‘Hydrofoiling offers very reduced water drag compared to ordinary boats and a very smooth ride through rough seas,’ Mr Zore said.

‘In other words, it needs much less power to achieve greater speeds.

‘That means much lower fuel consumption and much lower CO2 emissions.

‘Imagine cruising along the French Riviera in a GT car. Now you'll be able to cruise on the sea,’ he added.
