The Duchess of Cornwall became the latest famous face to get behind Andy Murray's bid to retain his Wimbledon title as she arrived to cheer him on this afternoon.

Resplendent in a beige and white polka dot dress accessorised with a neat pair of pearl earrings and a suede clutch bag, Camilla was on glamorous form as she took her seat in the Royal Box.

Once there, she waved happily at the crowds below - many of whom had come to see Murray take on Slovenia's Bla탑 Rola in the second round.

Murray, who is seeded third, is expected to win the match against Rola, rated 92st in the world, who before the match told the BBC that it would be 'a very, very big shock' if he managed to defeat the defending champion.

Joining the Duchess of Cornwall in the crowd on Court One was Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, who was pretty in a Hobbs dress, Burberry sandals and her favourite Aspinal tote.

Also spotted among the crowds was former England and Arsenal defender Sol Campbell and TV presenter Gabby Roslin.

Despite the presence of Ms Sears and assorted celebrities, this was one occasion where all eyes were on Camilla, who had earlier met the Armed Forces personnel who are providing stewarding services during the tournament.

She also spent some time chatting to 20-year-old tennis star Laura Robson and a group of very excited ball boys and girls.

The Duchess is in the middle of a busy series of engagements which began with a visit to a Gloucestershire arboretum on Monday.

There, she was shown how to propagate saplings before making a speech and planting a tiny tree of her own.

Later, she continued on to the National Portrait Gallery where she opened a fascinating new exhibition by British portrait artist Catherine Goodman.

Yesterday saw Camilla tour another gallery, this time for the opening of Voices from the Desert, where she met members of the 7th Armoured Brigade.

Over the weekend, she and Prince Charles will travel to Wales for their annual 'Wales Week', which will see the royal couple tour the principality from their base at Llandovery in Carmarthenshire.
