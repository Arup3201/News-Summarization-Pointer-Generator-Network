A 25-year-old has been arrested in connection with the death of Hazel North, 19

A man has appeared in court today in connection with a missing teenager’s death.

Hazel North, 19, from Dunfermline in Fife, Scotland, was last in contact with her family three weeks ago.

The man who has been charged with is Miss North’s boyfriend, John Davis, 25.

He has been charged with assault, assault to severe injury, murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice. He entered no plea and will be remanded in custody.

Police confirmed they arrested a 25-year-old man last night following the discovery of a woman’s body in a park 60 miles away in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that a 25-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with her death. A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'

Police said yesterday that they believe the human remains found in Dean Park are those of Miss North, who lived in Dunfermline’s Cairneyhill area.

Officers uncovered the body of a young woman after sealing off an area of Dean Park in Kilmarnock during the hunt for the teenager.

The grim discovery comes just two days after officers searched the house and garden of an address in the Ayrshire town occupied by Mr Davis.

Forensic experts worked at the property on Northcraig Road, which lies two streets away from the spot where Miss North’s remains were located early  yesterday morning.

‘I can confirm that a number of people have been spoken to in connection with the inquiry into Hazel’s disappearance and these enquiries are very much ongoing.’

Neighbours said they became aware of a ‘huge police presence’ around 6.30pm on Sunday as officers sealed off part of the park.

One said at the time: ‘The whole area is sealed off and there are police officers at every corner stopping you from getting anywhere near. There is a lot of thick undergrowth in that area.’

‘It is usually a very quiet and lovely area. I just feel so sorry  for the family of that poor wee lassie.’

Anne McCluskey, 40, said: ‘All my love goes out to that family at this really difficult time.

‘There has been a huge amount of police activity and we could see the forensic teams working for several hours.’

Over the weekend, hopes were raised that Miss North was still alive after officers said they were investigating a possible sighting in Stranraer, Wigtownshire, at around midday last Tuesday.

Police said Miss North, who was described as 5ft 8in tall and of slim build, with shoulder-length blonde hair, used to live in Stranraer and was supposedly seen in the company of another woman.

Her brother Michael made a  Facebook appeal for help with the search ‘so we can have her back with the family who love her loads’. Miss North’s own Facebook page lists her as a former pupil of Stranraer Academy. There has been no activity from her since February 5.

On January 9, she posted: ‘In such a happy good mood, love life at the moment, everything is turning out for the best, don’t think been this happy in a long time. 2014 looks like it’s gonna be my year.’

Her family were unavailable for comment.
