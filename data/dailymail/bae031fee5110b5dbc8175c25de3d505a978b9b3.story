A man who was wrongfully imprisoned for 21 years for the rape and murder of a mother of four was awarded $6million from the state of Connecticut. 

Kenneth Ireland, 44, was jailed when he was 18 and released in 2009 after DNA tests proved another man fatally beat and raped 30-year-old Barbara Pelkey in Wallingford. 

The other man, Kevin Benefield, is serving a 60-year prison sentence for killing the mother-of-four. 

Mr Ireland was issued the award yesterday under Connecticut's wrongful incarceration compensation law.

State claims commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr issued the award to Mr Ireland and said in a report: 'No words or dollar amount will suffice to give him back the time that he lost and the misery that he endured.

'Mr. Ireland was wrongfully convicted and was labeled a murderer and sex offender and was forced to spend a long portion of his life in maximum security prisons. 

'He experienced 21 years of violence, sleepless nights and the constant fear and hopelessness that he would die in prison as an innocent man.'

The new DNA testing came after the Connecticut Innocence Project, which looks into potentially wrong convictions, began reviewing Ireland's case in 2007.

Mr Ireland outlined the daily terror he experienced while in jail during the state's hearing to decide his compensation.

'Not one moment in my entire 21 years did I not have fear' Mr Ireland told NBC Connecticut in 2012. 

'You'd look up and there'd be 30 inmates, and everyone would have a sharpened piece of steel and they would just start stabbing other inmates.'

He described prison as an endless cycle that would rotate between 'months and months' of boredom with '30 seconds of the most violent terror you could imagine', eventually resigning himself to the belief that he would die in prison of old age or 'more likely, a violent altercation'. 

In 1987 two people came forward to the police and said Mr Ireland and another man had made incriminating statements regarding their involvement in Mrs Pelkey's murder. 

A third person came forward a few months later and said Mr Ireland had confessed to the killing. 

The third witness later admitted she was drunk at the time and may have imagined that the statements were made.

Mr Ireland was charged based on these witness statements. 

He had sought up to $8million from the state under the wrongful incarceration compensation law.

He said he was 'extremely pleased' and 'thankful for the hard work and the thoughtfulness of the state and the claims commissioner', on Thursday. 

'You can't replace those years, but I've gotten beyond that and I'm looking forward to the future. I'm not a live-in-the-past kind of guy.' 

Mr Ireland said he looks forward to traveling, possibly to Europe and Australia, but has no definitive plans for the $6million.

'This ensures my security and affords me a little bit of room to explore the world and become familiar with and see things I've missed,' he said.

Ireland worked as a bookkeeper after he was freed from prison. 

In October, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy appointed him to a paid position on the state parole board with an annual salary of $92,500.

In a statement on Thursday, Gov. Malloy said: 'Kenneth Ireland is a man of extraordinary character who endured the unimaginable pain of two decades of wrongful incarceration, and yet is not only without bitterness, but is incredibly thoughtful, insightful and committed to public safety and service.' 

'Modern DNA technologies are ensuring that the violent criminals who have actually committed the crimes are convicted and remain behind bars. I applaud the work of the Innocence Project.'

Mr Vance broke down to the million just how the state figured out what it owed to Mr Ireland. 

'For loss of liberty and enjoyment of life, $2.5 million; loss of earnings and earning capacity, $1.5 million; loss of reputation, $300,000; physical and mental injuries, $1.5 million; costs and expenses, $200,000.' 

Mr Ireland's $6million award is the first under the wrongful incarceration compensation law.

The statute was passed in 2008, a year after the legislature awarded $5million to James Tillman, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for a rape he didn't commit and freed in 2006.
