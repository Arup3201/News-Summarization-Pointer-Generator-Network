A Princeton graduate accused of killing his multimillionaire father spoke to cops about his physique, exercise regime and diet in the hours after his arrest, but did not mention his death, court documents have revealed.

Tommy Gilbert Jr, 30, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to shooting Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, in the head at his luxury Manhattan home last month. 

The 6'3' former aspiring model appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court  handcuffed and dressed in his Department of Corrections orange jumpsuit with prison-issue sneakers. 

His blonde surfer locks were cropped short and his once-groomed facial hair was now long and unkempt.

According to court documents, Gilbert was asked in the hours after his arrest by a detective how he kept in such good shape. 'A lot of it is diet and exercise,' Gilbert said. Asked if he ran marathons, he said, 'I'm not a distance runner.'

During an interview after his arrest, Gilbert (mugshot right) was asked by a detective how he kept in such good shape. He replied: ''A lot of it is diet and exercise.' Asked if he ran marathons, he said, 'I'm not a distance runner.'

Gilbert Jr, who attended the prestigious Deerfield Academy prior to Princeton and was seen at some of Manhattan's most exclusive society events, was charged with second-degree murder and related crimes. 

Seated with his defense attorney, Alex Spiro, Gilbert responded in a deep, level voice: 'Not guilty.' 

The defendant remained seated at a table with hands cuffed behind his back during the brief appearance, nervously tapping his feet on the floor. A court officer stood behind his chair and another officer to the side.

Defense attorney Alex Spiro objected to the presence of press photographers in court to Judge Jackson. His request was denied. 

Mr Spiro said outside court that his objection  was because the murder case is circumstantial without eyewitnesses.

'Because of the garb that they had him wearing, I think it's prejudicial to have his photo published,' the lawyer said. He didn't comment further.

Spiro is a Harvard-educated criminal lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying the attorney's fee.

Gilbert's next court date has been set for April 30. He is being held without bail at Rikers Island.

A grand jury voted to indict Gilbert last month over the death of his 70-year-old father, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners.

The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online last month that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide.  

Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife Shelley in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head.

Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. 

He allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities.

Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there hours after the murder.

Gilbert Jr was arrested on murder charges the following day.

Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home.

Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports.

The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. 

Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr.

He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing.

He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire. 

Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties.

But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton with a degree in economics.

Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. 

Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital.  

His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father.

He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. 

Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said.

Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. 

When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. 

When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. 

His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed.
