Injured Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta tried to lift spirits before the game. In his programme notes, he told fans he hoped to be back in action for the big Barclays Premier League clash against Manchester City on September 13.

Arteta hurt his ankle in a clash with Demba Ba in the first leg against Besiktas. Arteta said: ‘I am trying to work as hard as I can, even when I am resting. I hope to be back for the Man City game and I’ll do everything I can to be there.’

Tough night for Bilic  

Slaven Bilic appeared agitated and confused like a caged beast as he prowled around behind the corporate glass of the Emirates Stadium’s VIP areas before the game, the coach having been banned after his dismissal in the first leg. 

His assistant Nikola Jurcevic took his place on the touchline but Bilic was writhing in his seat, chewing his fist.

Arsene Wenger was not happy with some of the physical attention from Besiktas in Istanbul and he was on his feet to complain again in the first half as the Turkish team started with the same aggressive intent. 

Why should opponents make it easy for Arsenal? Although perhaps Veli Kavlak took it a bit far, he was booked for dissent after confronting referee Pedro Proenca.

Zigic deal doesn’t have appeal to Arsene

There has been a stampede worthy of a new Primark store since it became clear Olivier Giroud would be out until the new year, with agents offering centre forwards ranging in quality from Rademal Falcao (wanted by Real Madrid and very expensive) to Nikola Zigic (not wanted by Birmingham and also very expensive). Zigic’s agent Milan Calasan said: ‘Wenger called me and told me he wants to bring Zigic to Arsenal. You cannot reject an offer like that but Zigic is the one who must decide.’

However, asked about the possibility of signing the 6ft 7in Serbian, Wenger responded: ‘Who? Zigic? No.’

Wanted: Radamel Falcao has been offered to Arsenal along with Nikola Zigic, who isn't wanted at Birmingham
