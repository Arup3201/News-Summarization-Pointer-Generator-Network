Shocking videos purporting to show two women being gang raped have been released by a campaign group in India in a bid to name and shame the attackers.

The graphic footage, originally filmed and then shared on the messaging app WhatsApp, has been edited to obscure the victims' identities but the men caught on camera smiling while carrying out the alleged attacks remain visible.

A movement called #shametherapistcampaign has now been launched in what is the latest attempt to fight back against repeated incidents of extreme sexual violence towards women in India.

The videos and images of the alleged attackers were released by Sunitha Krishnan through her organisation Prajwala India, a women's rights NGO based in Hyderabad, India.

MailOnline is not able to verify the veracity of the footage, but the first purports to show a group of five men allegedly raping a woman and smiling while the attack is carried out.

In the second, unrelated video, only one man is pictured but a second person is present and holding the camera.

The content of both videos is too graphic to be published. Both were originally posted on YouTube only to be removed after breaching the site's terms and conditions.

Only 30 minutes after the campaign was launched on Indian national television, rocks were thrown through the window of Mrs Krishnan's vehicle in an apparent attempt to intimidate her. 

India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women following the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in Delhi in 2012.

The 23-year-old died after she was raped then tossed out of the moving vehicle. Despite receiving treatment at a Singapore hospital, she died two weeks later.

Mrs Krishnan wrote on her Facebook page that her #shametherapistcampaign was born when a concerned man forwarded her the videos after they were sent to him on the messaging service WhatsApp.

She wrote: 'Some sick pathetic human beings are sending videos of rape on 'WhatsApp'. If any of you are getting such videos please report... We will use the same tool to shame and punish the rapist.

'On checking the videos I found it was... a true video which some sicko while raping had recorded it - in all probability to threaten and intimidate the victim.'

She said the original videos were eight minutes and four minutes long, but she edited them to protect the identity of the victim while shaming the alleged attackers.

'We have to stand up now to end this. These rapists have to be traced, shamed and punished. Lets make this is a national campaign, for this is our chance to make our world more safe.'

At the official launch of her campaign, Mrs Krishnan told Indian broadcaster NDTV the videos were recorded about six months ago.

'Ten seconds into the video, I was overcome. I had to stop as I needed to throw up.'

It comes just months after a Japanese student was allegedly gang raped by five men who kidnapped her and subjected her to more than a month of sexual abuse in eastern India.

The 23-year-old woman was lured to a house near a Buddhist shrine in Bihar state in November by a tour guide, where she says she was raped by five men.

After a month, the men are said to have taken her for medical treatment in a nearby town where she escaped and made her way to Calcutta.

A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of the videos and are looking to identify both the victim and the offenders.'
