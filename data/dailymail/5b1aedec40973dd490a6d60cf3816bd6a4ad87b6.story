Canada will stop issuing visas to
people from the three West African nations where the Ebola is
widespread, the government said on Friday.

The federal citizenship ministry, explaining the move, said
in an official document that 'the introduction or spread of the
disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public
health'.

About 5,000 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone this year in the worst Ebola outbreak on record. Fears
rose that the disease could spread beyond the region after a few
cases were diagnosed in Spain and the United States.

Cut off: Visa for Canada will no longer be issues for countries affected with Ebola outbreaks, namely Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia

Banned: The ban applies to all visas for people who have been in a country with widespread Ebola transmission in the past three months

Canada - which has not reported any cases of Ebola so far -
is following in the footsteps of Australia, which on Tuesday
became the first rich nation to issue such a ban. The country's
official in charge of the response to Ebola said the move was
medically unjustified.

Under the new regulations, which come into force
immediately, Canada will not process visa applications from
foreign nationals who have been in an Ebola-affected country
within the previous three months.

U.S. President Barack Obama is so far resisting pressure to
impose similar travel restrictions.

Codie Taylor, the chief spokeswoman for Immigration Minister
Chris Alexander, did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.

Precautions: Immigration authorities said they made the decision because 'the introduction or spread of the disease would pose an imminent and severe risk to public health in Canada'

During SARS, the World Health Organization issued travel advisories directing people around the world to avoid places battling severe outbreaks. It is a tool the organization has not used since.

One of the places hit with a travel advisory was Toronto. Ontario's then health minister, Tony Clement -- now president of the federal treasury board -- was among those incensed by the WHO's move. 

Clement led a delegation to Geneva to successfully demand the WHO rescind the travel advisory against Toronto.

Under the IHR, countries agree not to restrict trade or travel over and above what is recommended by the WHO during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, known as a PHEIC. The WHO declared Ebola a PHEIC on August 8 and in doing so said countries should not close their borders to the West African countries struggling with Ebola.

It has repeated that advice several times since.

The IHR stipulate that countries that go beyond the WHO's recommendations have to back up their decisions with solid rationale. 

The latest figures from the WHO suggest at least 13,567 people have been infected since this Ebola outbreak began, and 4,951 have died.

The only nations which currently meet the definition of countries with widespread and persistent, intense transmission are Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
