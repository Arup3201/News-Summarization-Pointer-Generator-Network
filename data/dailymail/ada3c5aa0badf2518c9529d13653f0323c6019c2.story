This is the dramatic moment that a motorist saved the life of another man by pulling him to safety through the window of his car.

The unnamed pensioner became stranded after driving into deep flood water and was spotted by David Dunn from Keynsham, Somerset, earlier today.

Mr Dunn, 35, and his son, Callum, 13, drove their Land Rover into the flood after seeing him floating down the swollen river.

David Dunn and his son, Cameron, were able to drive through the water to help the stranded pensioner out of his car and onto the bonnet of their Land Rover in Keynsham, Somerset

Despite the danger, Mr Dunn drove the vehicle right up to the driver as the current threatened to sweep them away.

Mr Dunn climbed out of his 4x4 and onto the bonnet, then pulled the elderly man out through the driver's window and onto the bonnet of his vehicle.

They took him to the safety of dry land and, apart from being a little shaken from his ordeal, he was unharmed.

Callum Dunn stayed inside the vehicle from where he took pictures and filmed the rescue of the old man.

The elderly gentleman is thought to live nearby the incident in Keynsham, near Bristol.

Today Mr Dunn, from St Anne's, Bristol, said it was lucky the pensioner was spotted at all.

He said: 'We went out in the Land Rover 
to have a look at the flooding in the area and on our way back we saw 
the car in the water.

'As we looked a little closer we could 
make a person out so decided to drive up to it. I climbed out onto my 
bonnet and got him out of the window.

'It was getting dark and the car was 
submerged, he was old and the car was filling with cold water. It 
doesn't take long for hypothermia to set in.

'He was a bit shaken but he held onto a ladder on the roof of the car and we got him out.

;He was quite quiet and I offered to take him somewhere but he said he was fine and he'd just go go home and change clothes.'

The incident happened at Broadmead Lane -
which runs across a flood plain on the banks of the River Avon near 
Keynsham - late yesterday afternoon.

Mr Dunn, who works in building and 
maintenance, said he had never seen conditions in the area as bad as 
they were over the weekend.

He added: 'I've been off-roading for ten
years and I've driven in deeper water but with the way it was flowing, 
it is was much deeper it might have been more difficult.

'It happened on a road which goes through the fields. I've never seen anything like it.'
