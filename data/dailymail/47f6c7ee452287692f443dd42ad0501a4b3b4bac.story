A 23-year-old university student in China will be executed after hanging two prostitutes and having sex with their corpses.

The student, whose surname is Lee, was studying design at Jilin University in Changchun and told police that he had been failing a lot of classes and called the prostitutes to help relieve the pressure.

He also told detectives that he used to have fantasies about having sex with dead bodies and decided one morning that he could no longer resist carrying it out.

Macabre: The student had sex with a prostitute he'd murdered to fulfill a fantasy, police heard (file picture)

On March 6 this year he hired a 20-year-old prostitute called Cai through the internet, according to iFeng.com.

Lee then hanged her and had her body shipped back to his house in Changping , where he had sex with the corpse.

It was then dismembered and the parts buried in Lee’s garden.

Pressure: Jilin University (pictured) student Lee said he ordered the prostitutes to help him relax during his studies

On March 23 he carried out the same macabre act on the body of another prostitute that he’d hanged and shipped home.

A forensic psychiatrist determined that Lee wasn’t insane and was criminally responsible for the crimes.

The Second Intermediate People's Court found him guilty of intentional homicide and sentenced him to death.

It also ordered him to pay 80,000 yuan (£8,000) in compensation to the victims’ families.
