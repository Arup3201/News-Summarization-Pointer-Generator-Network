Brighton College headteacher Richard Cairns said he would like to see a minimum standard introduced for teachers

Top schools are finding it difficult to recruit would-be headteachers because job applications are littered with basic mistakes. 

Covering letters and CVs are often ‘really badly completed’ with appalling spelling and grammar, according to Emma Knights, head of the National Governors' Association.

Many candidates often fail to use the correct spelling for the school they are writing to.

According to recent figures one in four schools are struggling to employ senior staff.

'Sometimes, it's basic grammar that's wrong', Ms Knights told The Times.

'You don't expect a school leader to be told to put the apostrophe in the right place, or to check that their capital letters are in the right place, or they've got the school name right.' 

Last month the head of a leading independent school released examples of job applications he had received which exposed the sloppiness and poor standards of literacy among candidates.

Brighton College’s Richard Cairns received 50 letters for the position of deputy head. 

Of the 30 from people working at state schools, he said 12 were ‘semi-literate’ and only one made the shortlist.

According to Mr Cairns, some candidates were unsure how to address him in applications. 

One history teacher said he liked 'to see a student bossom' while a chemistry teacher gave his date of birth as 1053.

Mr Cairns also said that many teachers between 25 and 40 who were taught in state schools were never taught basic grammar, spelling and sentence structure.

The head called for a minimum standard to be introduced in which teachers would have to achieve at least three B grades at A-level, and a 2:1 degree in their chosen teaching subject.

The Department for Education said a growing network of teaching schools was helping to ‘identify teachers with potential for headship’.

'I like to see a student bossom'

'I have been a science teacher form more than 10 years'

'Date of birth: 1053'

'Dear Cairns'

'Dear Mr Richard'

The National Governors' Association is a charity for 300,000 volunteers who act as school governors, who appoint head teachers.

In December 2013, a new international study revealed that British pupils lag behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese city of Shanghai.

The study was carried out as part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and focused on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge.

The findings show that the UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France and Norway.

Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia.

Official figures have shown that one-in-five of state secondary school maths teachers in England do not have a maths degree, with the same being true of 34 per cent of physics teachers.
