Token of gratitude: Nurses at a Sheffield hospital have been told they must record all gifts and thank you cards they receive

They were once simply a nice gesture for patients to show how much they appreciated a caring nurse.

But now hospital staff have been told they will have to keep a monthly record of all the gifts and thank you cards they are given at work.

Nicknamed the ‘chocolate audit’, nurses at the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield have been ordered to keep a monthly tally chart of all the cards, chocolates and biscuits they receive.

The forms are split into two columns – ‘cards’ and ‘chocolates/biscuits’. A statement at the bottom reads: ‘When you are given a card or chocolates put a tally  on the chart. This is for governance data.’

The charts were brought in this month and staff will have to fill them out until August next year when they will be collected by bosses.

One staff member, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘This just leaves a sour taste in the mouth because something which was essentially a nice gesture has been turned into something bureaucratic and it is being used to monitor performance.’

The forms have also been criticised by campaigners who want to reduce bureaucracy in the NHS.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘You’d hope medical staff have more important things to do than snoop on the gifts and thank you cards coming into a hospital.

‘It’s a frankly bizarre idea that intrudes on the privacy of staff and patients, wastes valuable hospital time and takes micromanagement to a whole new level.’

He added: ‘It’s right that managers have the right data to run a hospital.

‘But when that starts to look like monitoring absolutely everything their staff are doing it stops being about management and becomes a misguided and intrusive assault on people’s privacy.’

However hospital bosses said they would not use the tally charts to monitor staff performance. Chris Morley, deputy chief nurse at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, said: ‘A small number of wards have chosen to record the many gestures of thanks which patients make in addition to the formal monitoring of suggestions and complaints.

Anger: One nurse who did not want to be named said that the move has left 'a sour taste in the mouth' (file picture)

‘This is not something which has been imposed across the Trust and does not form part of a formal governance collection process.

‘Having this record displayed enables all staff to be aware of the gestures of thanks patients have made.

‘Therefore the sentence “This is for governance data” is slightly inaccurate and on reflection should have been worded differently.’

In 2006 a similar scheme at the debt-ridden Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS trust was heavily criticised by health watchdogs and branded ‘management madness’.

The trust, which was £8million in debt and about to axe 300 jobs, ordered nurses to count how many gifts they received from patients.

Managers at the trust told staff to fill out forms stating what presents they get, who gave them and how much they are worth.

At the time one nurse said: ‘It’s a complete and utter waste of time – there are 101 things we could be doing.

‘We are all worried about who is going to lose their jobs but at the same time we are doing fiddly  little jobs like counting bags of chocolate buttons.’
