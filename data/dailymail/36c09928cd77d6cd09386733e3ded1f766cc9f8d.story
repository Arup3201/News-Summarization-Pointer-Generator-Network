Andrew Lansley announced in September that the patient database was being ditched

Taxpayers will have to pay at least a further £2billion towards the failed NHS IT database project even though it has already been scrapped, it has been claimed.

The US company behind the technology has apparently informed Wall Street that it expects its contract with the NHS to be extended.

This despite Health Secretary Andrew Lansley announcing in September that the national patient database scheme was being abandoned.

Francis Maude, Cabinet Offcie Minister  in charge of procurement, said at the time it had 'let down the NHS and wasted taxpayers' money''.

But it now appears that cancelling contracts relating to the fiasco could be more expensive than ploughing ahead with it.

Computer Sciences Corporation expects an estimated £2billion, despite the company already failing to deliver a fully functional version of its software, The Times reported.

The £11.4billion National Programme for IT in the NHS was set up in 2002At the time it was billed as the world’s biggest civilian computerisation project, and aimed to give doctors instant access to patient records, wherever they were being seen.

CSC signed a deal to computerise records in most of England. Digitising the medical records of the country’s 62million people was the core objective of the National Programme for IT in the NHS, accounting for £7bn of the total estimated cost.

Mr Lansley said he made the decision to 'urgently dismantle' the failed project after criticism it was not value for taxpayers’ money.

CSC was tasked with providing a patient database to 166 health trusts in the North, Midlands and East. It has so far failed to delvier a fully operational system.

After it failed to hit one of its targets fears grew about its ability to complete the task, and its share prcie dropped.

The business is currently being sued by two groups of shareholders in the US for making fraudulent claims about the progress of its NHS work.

CSC says it has been given notice of contract default by th NHs, but blames the health service for failures and breaches of contract.

A memorandum of undersdtanding between the two anticiaptes a one-year extension to the contract, until June 2017.

The Times reports that CSC beleives ministers will honour this  becasue of the risk of being sued for damages and the need to begin a new search for an IT supplier, while also paying CSC to maintain its software.

An investigation by The Times into the project fiasco also found that health trusts were threatened with cuts unless they agreed to implement the system and civil servants privately estimated that the software had a 33 per cent chance of being delivered late.

Computer applications installed as part of the scheme have also failed or been scrapped.

However, £250,000 in bonuses has been 
paid by the DoH to 80 people involved in the scheme as a reward for 'an 
exceptional contribution to delivery', the newspaper said.

The database was meant to allow doctors access to patient records wherever they are in the country

According to the paper, officials also calculated that it would cost nothing to scrap the system if it went wrong. But the Government is now embroiled in a multimillion-pound legal battle with former suppliers and admits that the cost of ending the project may be higher than going ahead.

CSC, one of the world’s biggest IT providers, had been contracted to provide patient record software, known as the Lorenzo system, to 166 NHS hospitals. But it has delivered on 10 projects. None of those systems is fully functional.

On Wednesday night, the Department of Health admitted that 'negotiations' were ongoing with the company over its NHS contracts, but would not comment further.

Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said it was 'shameful' to pour more money into a failed initiative.

'There needs to be greater accountability and regular auditing to ensure that money is not being thrown away on wasteful projects.
