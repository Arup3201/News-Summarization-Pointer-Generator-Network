A young star of the dancing world is being sued by her elderly theater director ex-boyfriend who claims she had tricked him into buying her a $775,000 apartment.  

Natasha Diamond-Walker, 27, is accused in court documents of pretending to be in love with prestigious Italian director Antonio Calenda and then dumping him once he had paid for her Manhattan home.

Miss Diamond-Walker, who performs with the Martha Graham Dance Company and studied at Fordham University, is painted as a heartless, gold-digger in the lawsuit.

Beguiling: Dancer Natasha Diamond-Walker, 27, is being sued by her 73-year-old ex-boyfriend over the Manhattan apartment he bought for her

Performance: Antonio Calenda, with Natasha Diamond-Walker to his right, is seeking the value of the apartment plus $1million in damages from his former girlfriend

The suit was filed on Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court for the cost of the one-bedroom condo plus an extra $1 million in damages.

Mr Calenda's lawyer, Marc Fitapelli told the MailOnline: 'She never had any intentions to repay our client and she abruptly severed their relationship as soon as she got what she wanted.'

He went on to claim that the stunning 27-year-old 'manipulated' his client and 'took advantage of him.'

The couple met while working on a project in Italy together last year. Cercando Picasso (Looking for Picasso), a show that features dancers interpreting Pablo Picasso's paintings, dreams and writings.

Bending over backwards: Mr Calenda had a written agreement with the dancer that he would loan her the money for an apartment... but she allegedly said the money was a gift

They began a 10-month romance where 
the young woman was showered with expensive gifts by the experienced 
director, who separated from his wife ten years ago. 

Friends that witnessed the whirlwind romance said that there was nothing out of the ordinary about it.

'They had a personal relationship ...
They're both adults,' LaRue Allen, executive director of the Martha 
Graham company, said to the  New York Daily News.

Adding: 'Things don't always have a way of working out.'

The director of the acclaimed Teatro Stabile in Trieste, Italy purchased the condo for Miss Diamond-Walker in Manhattan's affluent Upper West Side.

Affluent: The luxury apartment is located on 71st Street and has a 24-hour doorman

Home: The apartment, which is newly renovated, features a wood floor, pre-war moldings, big windows and an over-sized kitchen

Nest: The 795-foot apartment is close to Lincoln Center, the heart of the New York City theater scene

Miss Diamond-Walker no doubt wanted to be closer to Lincoln Center, the heart of the New York City theater scene, in the 795-foot apartment.

The apartment, which is newly renovated, features a wood floor, pre-war moldings, big windows and an over-sized kitchen.

The enormous  71st Street property has 3.5 rooms and a lux 24-hour doorman.

The Italian director is based in Rome but agreed to help Miss Diamond-Walker buy the apartment as long as the money be considered a loan and that they have a written agreement.

The two signed an agreement on July 19, 2011, in which Miss Diamond-Walker allegedly agreed to repay the entire sum, without interest, for several years.

No payments were required until December 2018 - but then the amount is due in full.

The dancer then ended the relationship, just three months after she secured the 'loan', telling her older lover she 'would never repay him', according to the documents obtained by the MailOnline.

'She was lovely and sweet, as most 
people are when they are happily buying an apartment,' a source familiar
with the deal told the MailOnline.

The source added that in all the real estate dealings, Mr Calenda
never made an appearance and was hardly mentioned. When told of the 
fate of their relationship, the source wasn't surprised.

'Things happen,' they said.

Miss Diamond-Walker is currently on tour with the Martha Graham Dance Company at the International Dance Festival in Vali, Colorado, and could not be reached for comment.
