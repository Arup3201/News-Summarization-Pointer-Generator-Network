Artist Julie Green has spent 13 years painting the last meals of death row inmates on plates, depicting everything from ice cream and cigarettes to, most prominently, KFC fried chicken and McDonald's burgers.

One final plateful show a convicted murderer's first ever birthday cake, just before his 2007 execution having spent 22 years on death row.

The painter, from Oregon, has finished more than 500 plates of prisoners' last meals, a project which began after reading about an inmate's final supper in her local paper.

Last Supper: Artist Julie Green has spent 13 years painting over 500 plates of last meals eaten by Death Row inmates across the U.S.

Her plates include some rather unusual meal choices, such as a packet of Pall Mall cigarettes from New
York in 1963 and a bag of Jolly Ranger sweets requested by one inmate in Texas in 2001.

The most common meals ordered by death row prisoners before their execution are McDonald's food and KFC chicken.

Ms Green first took an interest in the death row meals after moving to Norman, Oklahoma, in 1997, where the local newspaper would to print execution notices which included inmate's last morsels.

Oklahoma has the highest number of executions per capita and the newspaper often printed several notices of execution per week.

California, January 17th, 2006: The final meal of Clarence Ray Allen consisted of a buffalo steak, a bucket of KFC white-meat-only chicken, sugar-free pecan pie, sugar-free black walnut ice cream, Indian pan-fried bread and whole milk

On the row: Clarence Ray Allen was sentenced to death for ordering the killings of three people while he was behind bars in 1980 for another murder, to prevent them from witnessing upon a possible release

Texas, September 21st, 2011: The meal which ended the right of the state's Death Row prisoners to request final meals; Two chicken steaks, one pound of barbecued meat, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a meat-lover's pizza, three fajitas, an omelet, a bowl of okra, one pint of Blue Bell Ice Cream, some peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts and three root beers, of which Lawrence Russell Brewer ate nothing

Refusing: White supremacist Lawrence Russell Brewer was sentenced to death by lethal injection for tying James Byrd Jr, a black man, to a truck and dragging him to death in June 1988

Indiana, May 5th, 2007: David Leon Woods, 42, spent 22 years on death row after murdering a 77 year old man. He had never had a birthday cake so one was ordered for his final meal by the prison Michigan City, Indiana

After moving to Oregon in 2000, Julie started The 
Last Supper project with the execution notices she had collected over the years.

She said: ‘I collected the menus for a while, and I can’t really pinpoint why - it just bothered me.

‘The meals brought me into this issue.
I grew up in a family of wonderful cooks, and there was a lot of 
tradition with meals passed down through generations.

‘And the idea of a meal whose purpose 
is not to sustain life, or be shared, but seems to have this other 
symbolic meaning, just compelled me.’

Texas, June 15th, 2010: Four eggs, four chicken drumsticks, salsa, four jalapeno peppers, lettuce, tortillas, hashbrowns, garlic bread, two pork chops, white and yellow grated cheese, sliced onions and tomatoes, a pitcher of milk and a vanilla shake

Texas, October 22nd, 2001: A single bag of assorted Jolly Ranchers sweets
