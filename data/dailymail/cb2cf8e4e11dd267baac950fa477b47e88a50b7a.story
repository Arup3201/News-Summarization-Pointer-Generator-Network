He is one of the greatest of the Great War poets, was described as 'the handsomest young man in England' by fellow writer W.B Yeats and spent years travelling the world before dying tragically young during the Gallipoli campaign.

But while the later career of Rupert Brooke, the author of the famous line: 'If I should die, think only this of me: that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England', is well known, his time spent travelling in Tahiti is shrouded in mystery.

There, he was rumoured to have fathered a child with a local woman - rumours that were later brushed under the carpet by his family and have never been proved.

Now Brooke's biographer Jill Dawson reveals why she believes the tales to be true - and presents compelling new evidence to suggest that the poet may indeed have been a father, although tragically, he would never know his daughter.

'The handsomest young man in England': Brooke in a 1913 photo taken ahead of his South Pacific trip

The Soldier, with its famous line: ‘If I should die, think only this of me: that there’s some corner of a foreign field that is forever England’, is one of the best-known poems in the English lexicon.

But the idea that Rupert Brooke might have had a child, had left a part of himself deep in the South Seas islands, comes as a surprise to many.

A child born out of wedlock to a Tahitian woman who some described as a prostitute doesn’t fit with the version of Brooke as a poster boy for the Establishment and patriotic feeling.

In fact Brooke was a far more complex figure than this version allows: his prose writings give a much fuller picture of the man.

He wrote a play, many wonderful letters, as well travel essays highly critical of British and American attitudes to the indigenous people of the South Seas.

'The white population of heaven must be very small indeed,' he claimed.

He travelled by cruise ship to America, Canada New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti in 1913 and his letters home show how bewitched he was by the South Sea islands:

‘Hour after hour one may float in the warm lagoons, conscious in the whole body, of every shred and current of the multitudinous  water…..’ he wrote.

He was also enchanted by Taatamata, a young woman with 'wonderful eyes' whom he met at the Tiare Hotel in Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, in 1913. 

'She has wonderful eyes, the walk of a Goddess and heart of an angel,' wrote a smitten Brooke. She too was devoted to him.

‘I
 think I shall write a book about her – only I fear I am too fond of 
her,’ he wrote in a letter home. The five South Seas poems he went on to
 publish in 1914 were infused with love for her and the islands.

Battle: Brooke was supposed to take part in the Gallipoli campaign but was taken ill and died before he arrived

That, for most, is where the story of Rupert Brooke, Taatamata and the South Sea Islands end. But evidence suggests that it isn't quite true.

On his return to the UK, Brooke wrote to his boyhood friend Dudley Ward and confessed to a dream in which his beloved Taatamata committed suicide. 

He was clearly worried about her.  'No mention of a baby,' he adds, suggesting that the possibility of having conceived one was high and played on his mind.  

A reply from Taatamata eventually reached him via an extraordinarily circuitous route. It was dated 2nd May 1914 and began ‘My dear Love darling’. 

It had been forwarded from Ottawa, having been recovered by divers from the Empress of India, the ship that had gone down in the St Lawrence Seaway, taking most of its passengers with it.

Although 
rather bedraggled by the time he was able to read it, the letter 
confirmed his suspicions.  In a mixture of French, English and Tahitian 
his Polynesian girlfriend writes: 'Sweetheart....I grow fat all time.'

Brooke’s
 reaction is unknown. There the trail ends. It wasn’t until 21 years 
after Rupert Brooke’s death that Dudley Ward began making enquiries 
about the existence of a child.

By
 then 50 years old, a CBE and a member of the Treasury, it’s doubtful 
that Ward would have bothered if he hadn’t had a strong inkling that 
such a child was probable, so did Brooke confide in him?

The date of Ward’s detective work coincides with the death of Brooke’s mother. Ward, perhaps sensitive to the hurt it might cause, preferred to let the rumours well alone while Mrs Brooke was alive.

Ward's search for the truth began with a letter to Norman Hall, director of Mutiny on the Bounty, asking if he knew of Tataamata, apparently ‘the only woman that Rupert Brooke really cared about’. 

Hall replied that she was well known to him, lived on Moorea, and was ‘still quite a handsome woman and must have been a very attractive girl when Brooke knew her’.

He promised to ask about a child but if he did, there is no record of it. Norman Hall died in 1951 but his daughter confirmed that her mother had always known that Alice Rapoto, a close friend of the family, was the daughter of Brooke and Tataamata.

She supplied the only known photograph of Alice who died around 1992 (if born in 1915 she would have been 77), although no records of birth or death confirm this.

The islands of Tahiti and French Polynesia are about as far as it’s possible to travel from the UK and most biographers, including Mike Read, who came closest to the story in his biography Forever England, didn’t make the journey.

In 2006 I began research on my novel The Great Lover about the life of Rupert Brooke and made the trip to Tahiti.  

Despite my enquiries I found no evidence of a child on that research trip so I wrote the novel anyway, using the logic of imagination and the inferences of Mike Read’s book and Taatamata’s letter.  This year – a month ago - I was invited back to a Salon du Livre festival in Tahiti’s capital, Papeete.

While there I did some TV interviews and made general enquiries. I didn't look for documents in the knowledge that Polynesian culture is often casual about such things.

I had some great conversations with other writers and translators and experienced anew the sensory assault that bewitched painters like Matisse and Gaugin.

Brooke himself had painted a picture of the scene in words: 'And after dark, the black palms against a tropic night, the smell of the wind, the tangible moonlight like a white, dry translucent mist, the lights in the huts, the murmur and laughter of passing figures, the passionate, queer thrill of the rhythm of some hidden dance, all this will seems inexplicably and almost unbearably like a scene your heart has known long ago, and forgotten and yet always looked for.’

Still, confirmation of the existence of an Alice Brooke hadn't appeared. I returned home, although not before sending an email.

And I struck lucky, although the evidence was anecdotal. The writer translating The Great Lover into French a teacher who lives on the nearby island of Ra’iatea, mentioned he’d been talking to a friend about me and my novel.

His friend, Georgia, told him that as a child in the 1960s she met a beautiful woman with long grey hair, called Alice Brooke, living in grand house on the island of Moorea overlooking Tahiti.

Everyone knew, Georgia says, that her father was the English poet, Rupert Brooke. There were children around, small children, thought to belong to Alice.

It might not be the DNA evidence that a court would want but taken together, to me, there are too many coincidences to overlook.

I like to think that living quietly in Tahiti are Alice's children, the grandchildren of Tatamaata and Rupert Brooke - one of the greatest poets the UK ever produced.
