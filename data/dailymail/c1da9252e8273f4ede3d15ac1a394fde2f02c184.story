A children's playground has been left looking like a 'battleground' after wild boar began grazing on the land.

The animals have repeatedly churned up the ground and left the site unsafe and dangerously uneven.

Council leaders are now considering installing anti-boar fencing to ward off the animals.

The recent attacks have been blamed on the soaring boar population in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, and homeowners in Lydney say their gardens have also been damaged.

Ian Harvey, wildlife manager for the Forestry Commission, said: 'The play equipment is well used and there's always the concern that a child or adult could turn their feet badly on the uneven ground.

'It's an area the boar have expanded into to feed. If they find an area which has a good source of food they will keep coming back.

'In the forest we've seen this repeatedly on grass verges outside homes, and it upsets a lot of people.

'We've always had issues like this with the boar but more problems are being caused as their numbers go up.'

A Lydney town council spokesman said it cannot control the wild boar, but they can do everything possible to limit the damage they cause.

Deputy mayor of Lydney Brian Thomas said the town council is looking at installing fencing with mesh to prevent the boar from breaking through.

The recent attacks on the land (pictured) have been blamed on the soaring boar population in the Forest of Dean, and a forestry chief says their numbers will continue to grow because there has been a lack of culling

He said: 'The play area looks like a battleground and the grass has been eaten more consistently in the last two months.

'Lumps of grass and earth have appeared and it's not very good for walking or running in. It's no longer fit for purpose.

'We're going to attempt to fence the area off from the forest, but it's not registered land so we can't surround it completely.'

A Lydney town council spokesman said the installing anti-boar fencing would cost thousands of pounds and would delay other projects such as the proposed new play equipment on the site.

The wild boar population in Forest of Dean is constantly growing and there is no sign their numbers will fall. The animals are prolific breeders, and young females have litter sizes of eight to ten.

Those animals will then go on to have their own offspring the following year.

The wild boar do not have any predators, which is another reason their numbers are a problem.

Mr Harvey, senior wildlife manager for the commission, said: 'We have not been culling enough and the population continues to increase year on year.

'It is quite simple to see how the population can quickly escalate and it is fairly common in Europe.'
