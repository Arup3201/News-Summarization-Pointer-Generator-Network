A judge's decision to dismiss a harassment charge against a Muslim accused of attacking a man marching as 'Zombie Muhammad' during a Halloween parade last year was today branded 'completely and unequivocally unacceptable'.

Ernest Perce was marching through Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, with a fellow atheist dressed as a 'Zombie Pope' when he was confronted by Talaag Elbayomy, 46, about his 'offensive' costume.

Perce claims Elbayomy then choked him from behind and tried to remove a sign that read 'Muhammad of Islam' from around his neck.

He was confronted by Talaag Elbayomy about his 'offensive' costume, which included the sign 'Muhammad of Islam', here invisible so added by Perce electronically

Elbayomy was charged with harassment after Perce reported the 'attack' to a nearby police officer.

Elbayomy in turn filed his own complaint with police accusing Perce of instigating the incident and claiming he never laid a hand on him. He admitted arguing with Perce about his costume.

When the case came to court in December, Cumberland County Magisterial District Judge Mark Martin - an Iraq War veteran and a recent Islam convert - said there wasn't enough evidence to convict Elbayomy of harassment as it was one man's word against the other's.

A video of the incident taken from Perce's point of view, and now posted on YouTube, could not be taken into account because it was ruled inconclusive.

In an audio recording of his ruling released by Perce this week, Judge Martin said: 'I think our forefathers intended that we use the First Amendment so that we could speak what's on our mind, not to p*** off other people and cultures, which is what you did.

'You are way outside your bounds of First Amendment rights.

'You've completely trashed their essence, their being. I'm a Muslim. I find it offensive.'

Criticised: Judge Mark Martin (centre), a former Iraq War veteran and recent Islam convert, has been accused of showing a 'preferential opinion of Islam over Christianity'

The judge added: 'When we go to other countries it's not uncommon for people to refer to us as ugly Americans.

'This is why we are referred to as ugly Americans, because we are so concerned about our own rights we don't care about other people's rights as long as we get our say but we don't care about the other people's say.'

The decision has outraged freedom of speech campaigners and legal experts.

The American Atheists organisation criticised the decision as 'completely and unequivocally unacceptable'.

It posted on its blog: 'That a Muslim immigrant can assault a United States citizen in defence of his religious beliefs and walk away a free man, while the victim is chastised and insulted by a Muslim judge who then blamed the victim for the crime committed against him is a horrible abrogation.

'I can promise you this, you have not heard the last of this issue. Not by a long shot.'

Failed legal bid: Perce is also angry that the judge 'railed on me for six minutes about how bad I was offending Islam'

Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, questioned whether Judge Martin was letting his personal views get in the way of the U.S. legal process.

Writing on his blog, he said: 'I can understand the judgeâ€™s claims of conflicting testimony on the crime... However, I view this as an extremely troubling case that raises serious questions of judicial temperament, if not misconduct.'

Perce said Judge Mark Martin showed a 'preferential opinion of Islam over Christianity' when in court.

He is also angry that the judge 'railed on me for six minutes about how bad I was offending Islam'.

Perce said the judge gave him permission to record the courtroom proceedings, although he was also warned that releasing the audio could result in him being charged with contempt of court.
