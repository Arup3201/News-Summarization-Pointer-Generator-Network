As Berenice was wheeled into surgery to have her right breast removed, she felt no nerves - just relief that she would no longer worry about dying of cancer.

This would be understandable had the 58-year-old's breast been afflicted with the disease - but it was healthy.

While the mother-of-two had been diagnosed with an aggressive tumour in her left breast, which she had removed in October 2009 after chemotherapy, her right breast was unaffected.

Berenice Cowan was tested for the faulty BRCA genes, which put carriers at high risk of breast cancer, but thankfully the results were negative.

However, in the months after surgery, she was plagued with worry about the cancer returning and became convinced that having her healthy breast removed was the right thing to do.

'I thought about it every day and was constantly checking for a lump,' says Berenice, who is married to Ian, 60. They have two sons, Paul, 31, and Marc, 23.

'I didn't tick any of the boxes for cancer, such as drinking, smoking, being overweight - yet I still got it. So why couldn't I get it again?'

Berenice is not alone. She is one of a growing number of women choosing to have double  mastectomies even though they don't need them.

Some regrets: Clare, pictured pre-op, now wishes she gave it more thought

A quarter of women who develop cancer in one breast now ask for both to be removed, according to figures from the London Breast Institute.

Some
 people I told thought I was mad and couldn't understand why I wanted 
the breast gone

Experts say the surge is due in part to the influence of actress Angelina Jolie, who earlier this year had a preventative double mastectomy after discovering she had the faulty BRCA1 gene.

Yet many women requesting double mastectomies do not carry such a gene, and have a much smaller chance of cancer in the unaffected breast.

Doctors have warned that the 'Jolie-effect' means women may be putting their health at risk, and some may suffer scarring or psychological issues as a result of  having both their breasts removed unnecessarily.

Better safe than sorry: Berenice had her healthy right breast removed because she feared cancer

Yet many women who push for the 
surgery - often against the advice of doctors - feel the peace of mind 
they gain is worth the risk.

'Some
 people I told thought I was mad and couldn't understand why I wanted 
the breast gone - but it was important to me,' says Berenice, who lives 
in Cheadle, Cheshire. She says she was petrified at the thought of 
receiving another cancer diagnosis, and of more chemotherapy, which had 
caused hair loss and crushing fatigue - yet her doctor was unwilling to 
put her forward for surgery.

'My doctors wouldn't do it,' she says. 'They said they couldn'’t just remove healthy tissue and that I'd feel differently in two years. But I knew I wouldn't.'

She also struggled with her new shape. 'I didn’t feel ready for reconstruction, and so I was left with one normal breast and one prosthesis. They didn’t match, and I was always uncomfortable.'

She brought it up with a different consultant during a check-up last year and found him more sympathetic. In October last year, she had the surgery.

'It's the best thing I've done,' she says.

'It's just such a weight off my mind.'

Berenice chose not to have a reconstruction, and now uses prostheses - or nothing at all.

'I do ballet, and when I go to classes I just wear my leotard; on holiday I wear a ruched bikini.

'I feel just as feminine, and my husband says I look beautiful.'

While Berenice opted not to have a reconstruction, some doctors believe improvements in reconstructive surgery are a factor in encouraging more women to have healthy breasts removed.

Lester Barr, consultant breast surgeon and chairman of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, says: 'Women are less afraid of mastectomies than they were in the past. More women are surviving than ever before, and those survivors are afraid of developing a second cancer.'

So many are requesting their healthy breasts removed that Genesis recently looked into the reasons.

The most common reasons among those without a faulty gene were anxiety about being diagnosed again, the stress of chemotherapy, and wanting symmetrical breasts after reconstruction.

'As long as the decision is made after careful thought, my view is it is logical,' says Mr Barr.

Age risks

The biggest risk factor for breast cancer (other than gender) is age - 81 per cent occur in women over 50

'The only people we dissuade are those with a very low risk of cancer in the opposite breast - for example, a woman with a low- risk cancer who isin her 60s or 70s. It doesn’t make sense at that age.' Whatever the circumstances, it’s never an easy decision to make.

Tonni Pease, 26, was diagnosed with breast cancer in April last year, when her daughter Matilda was just 10 months old.

'The doctors recommended a mastectomy,' says Tonni who lives with her husband Jason, 28, and Matilda, now two, in King's Lynn, Norfolk. 'We decided I’d also be tested for faulty genes, because my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43.'

No worries: Berenice, pictured with her husband, said the operation means she no longer lives in fear of breast cancer

But the results didn’t come back before her surgery, so Tonni made the brave choice to have both breasts removed, just in case.

'If I had the faulty gene, I’d need a double mastectomy and I couldn't face surgery again,' she says.

'I thought I must have the gene, because Mum had it and because I'd got cancer so young. My mum had a single mastectomy and was constantly worried it was going to come back on the other side. I didn't want to go through that.

'It was awful, though. I couldn't have reconstructive surgery done straight away as I had to have radiotherapy first.

Role model: But Angelina Jolie's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading since not everyone can afford the best reconstructive surgery

'I was only 25 and I’d lost both my breasts - I thought I’d never look the same. I also worried what Jason would think, but he’s always been totally supportive.'

In a cruel twist of fate, after she'd had her double mastectomy, the genetic test results came back showing Tonni was not a carrier.

'I was relieved for my daughter and sister,' says Tonni, 'but I made the right decision. I did what I could to see my little girl grow up.'

Surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel at the London Breast Institute says doctors must ensure women are well informed about the risks.

'In general, a doctor will do what the patient wants, but it’s important we explain that they may not benefit in terms of survival.

'That's because if they do go on to get cancer in the other breast, the likelihood is it will be picked up earlier than the first cancer.

'They must also be made aware of the psychosexual effect a mastectomy can have. It should only be done after careful consideration.'

Clare Mohan is one woman who wishes she’d given more thought to undergoing an elective double mastectomy in March 2010.

She watched as breast cancer struck three of her aunts, and then her mother in 2004. Tests showed her mother carried the faulty BRCA2 gene. Clare didn't want to wait to be tested herself, and had both her breasts removed.

'I couldn't let my daughters go through what I'd been through, and I wanted to show them there was a way to protect yourself,' says Clare, 32, who lives in Erdington, Birmingham, and is mother to Demi, ten, and Libby, four.

Clare had surgery in March 2010, but suffered complications and had to have a further operation which left her disfigured. She now suffers with terrible pain from scar tissue and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

Preventative: Tonni said her mastectomy was the right decision so she can see her little girl grow up

'I now worry my daughters will never want to do what I did because they've seen how it affected me.

'Women really need to think about what they’re doing. Look at the surgeon who’ll be doing the operation and take the counselling you’re offered beforehand .

'I really don’t think anyone should do it unless it's absolutely necessary.'

Clare warns the publicity around Angelina Jolie's mastectomy could be dangerously misleading.

'Her breasts look brilliant, but she has got the money to spend on it. Not everyone will look like her.'

But for women like Berenice, the risks are outweighed by feeling she has protected herself from a life-threatening disease.

'When I was told I had cancer, I felt like I'd been thrown into a black hole. I thought about not living to see my grandchildren.

'I don't ever want to have to experience that again.'
