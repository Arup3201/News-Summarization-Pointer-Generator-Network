For a string of middle-aged single women struggling with their finances, he seemed to be a knight in shining armour.

Having met Christian Barber on a dating website and fallen for his charm, he would reveal that he was an £118million lottery winner with a fleet of luxury cars. And, what’s more, he wanted to pay off all their debts.

But Barber was in fact a homeless conman who travelled across the country in his VW Golf, a court heard, gaining the trust of vulnerable women before raiding their bank accounts.

Lesson: Victim Christine Spencer, 57, (left) was duped by Christian Barber on a dating website

The 41-year-old – who claimed to own a
 hotel complex in Barbados and a large house in the exclusive Cornish 
resort of Rock – swindled more than £45,000 from at least six women, 
between September 2011 and March 2013.

After
 meeting on popular dating sites – including Plenty of Fish – and 
gaining their trust, he told them he would help with their financial 
problems.

But once he had their bank details, he would secretly steal large amounts of money from them.

The
 conman showed the women photographs of at least eight luxury cars he 
supposedly owned – including Maseratis and Porsches – but he in fact had
 no permanent home and the only vehicle he owned was a 2003 VW Golf.

One
 victim gave up her rented house believing they were moving in together,
 while another broke off a long-term relationship to be with him.

And
 one was left by the roadside after believing she was about to be taken 
on the holiday of a lifetime – only for him to drive off in search of 
his next victim.

On Friday, 
Barber admitted eight charges of theft, three charges of fraud and a 
charge of making off without payment for hotel accommodation. Yesterday 
he was jailed for 59 months.

His victims came from towns  across the country, from Yorkshire  to Cornwall.

Wendy
 Stubbs told the Mail how  she was so convinced by his fake  identity 
after meeting him in July 2011 that she quickly introduced him to her 
parents, her three grown-up children and friends.

‘My
 family thought he was amazing – as did I. He was charming and 
complimentary and seemed very genuine,’ she said.

Like many of the other
 women he seduced, he only told Miss Stubbs he was ‘secretly wealthy’ 
around three weeks into the relationship, saying he wanted to attract 
the ‘right kind of woman’ and not someone looking for money.

Devastated: Wendy Stubbs' house was also ransacked by Barber

Around
 the same time Barber – who also claimed he was a member of the 
upmarket  Barbour clothing company dynasty – offered to help with her 
finances.

He told the 
48-year-old driving instructor from Grantham that he hated to see her in
 so much debt and that he wanted to pay off all her credit card bills – 
and pretended to do so in front of her on the phone.

But
 instead, he began gradually stealing small amounts from her savings 
account as well as pretending to ‘invest’ large amounts of her money. 
Six weeks into the relationship – and still unaware of the money that he
 had slowly  stolen from her – the conman promised to whisk Miss  Stubbs
 to Dubai.

But after waiting
 in vain at her daughter’s house for him to pick her up, she returned 
home to find it had been ransacked and he had stolen several family 
heirlooms.

‘I was devastated,’ she said. ‘I feel like I’ve been to hell and back and I don’t think I can trust anyone again.’

She claims he stole £20,000 from her in total.

Another
 victim, Christine Spencer, 57, from Derby, told the Mail last night how
 Barber stole more than £11,000 from her over the course of their 
five-month relationship.

Scam: Barber used sites like Plenty of Fish to meet vulnerable women and eventually run off with their money having seduced them with elaborate lies

Around three weeks after meeting in January 2012, he told her he wanted to invest her money in his Barbados hotel business.

‘I
 was to head up this operation on a salary of £100,000 to recruit and 
train the employees,’ the learning and development professional said.

‘This of course never happened. I gave him my money and he “invested” it.’

The
 divorced mother of three added: ‘I have moved on and learnt to evaluate
 people more closely. This is a lesson for other women to be careful.

‘I would never have thought I’d be sucked into such a  scam but  he seemed completely genuine.’

Lincoln
 Crown Court heard that Barber had 16 previous convictions dating back 
to 1993 for offences including deception, fraud and burglary.

Recorder
 Gareth Evans QC told him: ‘You chose vulnerable victims. You moved from
 one victim to another when the money ran out. It was just a way of 
living for you.

‘You set out the bait. They took the bait and you then took their money, their dignity and their self-respect.

‘They would be left by the side of the road as you drove off to your next victim. It beggars belief.’
