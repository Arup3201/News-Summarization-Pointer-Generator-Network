A camera-shy mother-of-three has launched a career appearing at children's parties as a Disney princess after leaving her job as a council social worker.

Terri Cheesebrough's daughter Phoebe, five, begged her to dress up as Princess Elsa from the hit film Frozen at a school event after insisting they looked alike.

Parents began asking the 28-year-old from East Hull to act and sing at parties - and the resemblance has now spawned a whole new career.

Fairytale career: Ms Cheesebrough said she was 'camera-shy and I have never been confident having my picture taken but I've overcome that to do this job, and it's so worth it to see the look on the children's faces'

Ms Cheesebrough said she had suffered depression and anxiety in the past, and gave up her job as at Hull City Council in March last year because she was unable to give her all to the role.

She began looking for a more stress-free way to earn a living while still being able to look after Phoebe and her two sons Arthur, three, and seven-month-old Henry.

She said other parents were amazed by the resemblance and began booking her for £25 per appearance. 

'I have always been career driven but took a bit of a knock after suffering with depression and finishing my council job,' she said.

'I was keen to get back into work and the Princess Elsa job seem to come out of nowhere, but just at the right time.

Glittering career: The mother-of-three dons her blue sequined outfit for parties at which she charges £25 for an appearance. She admitted it was a low fee for singing, bringing presents and having photographs taken

'It all happened by accident, but working as a Disney Princess is so rewarding.

'I am extremely camera-shy and I have never been confident having my picture taken but I've overcome that to do this job, and it's so worth it to see the look on the children's faces.

'I couldn't believe it when all the parents and friends said I looked like Princess Elsa - my daughter Phoebe absolutely loves the film Frozen.

'The response has been fantastic and the kids absolutely love it.

'In a space of a week, everything took off and I have been so busy ever since. I'm working weekends and some evenings doing appearances - the support has been fantastic.'

Smash hit: Frozen became the highest-grossing animated film in history after its release last year at £644m

Success: Ms Cheesebrough said: 'In a space of a week, everything took off and I have been so busy ever since. I'm working weekends and some evenings doing appearances - the support has been fantastic'

Ms Cheesebrough charges £25 for appearances which usually consist of her singing, bringing presents and having photographs taken.

She added: 'As a mum it is important to keep the price affordable- I'm not making much profit, but it's a great job for fitting in around my children.'

Frozen became the highest-grossing animated film in history after its release last year, pulling in £644million at box offices worldwide and winning the Oscar for best animated picture.

It follows the story of 21-year-old Princess Elsa, whose ability to conjure snow and ice at will traps her kingdom in an eternal winter.
