The frightening scene of hundreds of deer jumping to their deaths off a 120-foot bridge in Idaho is bewildering wildlife officials who are finding themselves at a loss on what to do.

With motorists and state officials catching sight of the deers' tragic leap and fall off High Bridge, just east of Boise, witnesses are rallying for some way to prevent their tragic deaths.

'I've seen it myself and some of our staff have seen it too,' Evin Oneale, a manager with the Idaho Fish and Game Development told KBOI.

Tragic death: A frightening scene of hundreds of deer jumping to their deaths off High Bridge east of Boise, Idaho has wildlife officials grappling to find a solution

Long way down: Not expecting a 120-foot drop on the bridge's other side, the animals are believed to leap to their doom when startled by passing cars

Mr Oneale believes it’s when the deer are crossing the bridge and are startled by an oncoming car that they take the jump.

'The first thing a deer is going to do is try and get away,' he said. 'They jump over what they think is just into the barrow pit, but it's a 120-foot fall to the river below.'

Shocking photographs taken on the frozen river below show some of the animal’s bodies brutally encased in the ice.

According to KBOI more than 100 died in 2004's month of January alone.

Death toll: Officials say that in January of 2004 alone more than 100 deer, some seen in the area, plummeted to their deaths off the bridge

Victims: The bodies of deer encased in ice are seen after falling to their death off of High Bridge in Idaho

Hoping to stave off some of these deaths, in 2010 the Fish and Game came together with Idaho's Department of Transportation to build an underpass for the animals.

It leads them directly under highway 21 instead of crossing the bridge.

Fish and Game says the underpass has been successful but with colder weather bringing deer to lower elevations, motorists are pressed to take caution, traveling at slower speeds to not provoke the animals’ leap.

A problem in other areas as well, shocking videos posted to YouTube have captured similar deaths of the animals even when cars are seen at crawling speeds beside them.
