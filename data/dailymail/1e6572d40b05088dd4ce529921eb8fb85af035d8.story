A veteran Russian cosmonaut and two International Space Station crewmates, one from the United States and one from Germany, returned safely to Earth this morning at 3:58am GMT (10:58pm EST).

The parachute landing of their Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan ended five and a half months in orbit aboard the International Space Station.

Maxim Suraev of the Russian space agency, who was commander of the station during the mission, climbed into the Soyuz craft with Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman and German flight engineer Alexander Gerst from the European Space Agency and departed the orbital outpost last night.

About three and a half hours after leaving the ISS last night, the capsule descended through cold, windy and overcast skies to touch down on the frozen steppes northeast of Arkalyk.

Early-morning temperatures in Kazakhstan registered just -5C (23F), mission commentator Rob Navias said on a live Nasa television broadcast of the landing.

Recovery teams were standing by to help Suraev, Wiseman and Gerst out of their capsule, the same spacecraft they rode to reach the station on 28 May this year.

The crew's last few weeks in orbit were among the busiest of their mission, with the departure of a Dragon cargo capsule sent to the station by private launch company SpaceX and the arrival of a Russian freighter.  

The Russian cargo ship docked with the station less than a day after an unmanned Orbital Sciences Corp. rocket carrying another supply capsule bound for the space station exploded seconds after liftoff from Virginia.

The three had spent five and a half months in orbit on the ISS before their return journey back to Earth

Prolonged time in zero gravity means the astronauts' bones and muscles are weak on their return to Earth, so they often need to be carried by ground personnel when they first land

'It's been an honor and a privilege to spend 165 days up here. With that said, I'm looking forward to heading home,' Wiseman said during a change-of-command ceremony carried live from the space station on Nasa television.

Two other Russian cosmonauts and the newly named station commander, Nasa astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore, remained aboard the orbital outpost, a £62 billion ($100 billion) research laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418km) above Earth.

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 264 miles (425km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,600 days, during which time it has completed more than 88,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years.

They will be joined on 23 November by Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, Nasa astronaut Terry Virts and Italy's Samantha Cristoforetti, who will fly aboard another Soyuz capsule launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

The space station, which has been permanently staffed since 2 November 2000, is owned and run by a partnership of 15 nations.

'They say this is the most complex machine that humanity has ever built,' Gerst said on Saturday. 'Even after half a year on board, it is impossible for me to fathom how complex it is to actually operate this machine.'

During their time aboard the station, the crew participated in research focusing on Earth remote sensing, advanced manufacturing, and studies of bone and muscle physiology. They set a milestone for station science by completing a record 82 hours of research in a single week in July.

A key research focus during their mission, Expedition 41, was human health management for long duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station beginning in 2015.

The crew welcomed five cargo spacecraft during its time aboard the orbiting laboratory. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo vehicles docked to the station, bringing tons of supplies in July and October. The fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle, dubbed the Georges Lemaitre after the Belgian physicist who is considered the father of the big-bang theory, launched to the station in July.

Wiseman and Gerst ventured outside the confines of the space station for a planned spacewalk to relocate a failed pump module and configure the station for upcoming additions. Wiseman completed a second spacewalk with fellow Nasa astronaut Barry Wilmore. Suraev also conducted one spacewalk during Expedition 41.

In addition to being a scientific research platform, the space station also serves as a test bed to demonstrate new technology. The first 3-D printer to be tested in space arrived at the station during Expedition 41. It will be the first step toward establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, which is a critical enabling component for deep space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing.

A new Earth monitoring instrument called RapidScat also was installed and activated on the station during the crew’s time in orbit. RapidScat will measure Earth's ocean surface wind speed and direction, essential measurements used in weather prediction.

Having completed his second space station mission, Suraev now has spent 334 days in space. Wiseman and Gerst have spent 165 days in space with the end of their first flights.

Expedition 42 now is operating aboard the station with Barry Wilmore of Nasa in command. Wilmore and his crewmates, Flight Engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of Roscosmos, will tend to the station as a three-person crew until the arrival in two weeks of three new crew members: Terry Virts of Nasa, Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa.
