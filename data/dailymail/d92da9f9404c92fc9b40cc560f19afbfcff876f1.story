She's only seven weeks old, but Savannah Guthrie's daughter Vale has already made her first appearance on live television.

Baby Vale paid a visit to the Today show set Monday morning, surprising Tamron Hall, Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales in a Guess the Guest segment.

Carson Daly introduced the adorable newborn after providing hints such as 'This guest is a person of few words' and 'This guest has met many of the TODAY anchors but has never been live on the show.'

Ms Guthrie, 43, and her husband Mike Feldman, 45, proudly presented their bundle of joy, whom Mr Daly called 'the most awesome Guess the Guest.’

Vale even got to meet Ben Affleck, who was making an appearance to promote his latest film, Gone Girl. 

The new mom also revealed that she plans to return to work on November 3.

Hint, hint: Some of the clues provided were 'This guest is a person of few words' and 'This guest has met many of the TODAY anchors but has never been live on the show'

'What do you think? Am I welcome?' she asked Mr Lauer.

Ms Guthrie told Mr Lauer of motherhood: 'It’s exhilarating and thrilling and terrifying sometimes, but terrifying because I love her so much.' 

She added: 'I couldn’t love anything more. And I hold her life in my hands, and that is so scary sometimes.' 

Back to work: Ms Guthrie told Matt Lauer (right) that she will return to the Today show on November 3

Post-baby secret: 'You look amazing,' Tamron Hall (right) told Ms Guthrie, who modestly responded: 'Let me tell you, I’m wearing black'

Mr Lauer commented on Vale’s outfit, joking: 'She’s wearing the mittens because she’s a germophobe like me.'

But Ms Guthrie explained that the mittens were to protect Vale from scratching her face with her sharp nails.

'She likes to put her hands on her face and I am too much a baby to clip the nails. I’m terrified to do it,' she said. 'So I just file them and keep the mittens on.'

Special delivery: Ms Guthrie and Mr Feldman welcomed Vale on August 13

'You look amazing,' Ms Hall told Ms Guthrie, who modestly responded: 'Let me tell you, I’m wearing black.' 

Ms Guthrie and Mr Feldman welcomed Vale on August 13.

'[Vale] has blue eyes, a little bit of blondish hair and the chubbiest cheeks you’ve ever seen,' Ms Guthrie told Today shortly after Vale's birth. 'I think we found heaven in this little hospital room in New York City.'
