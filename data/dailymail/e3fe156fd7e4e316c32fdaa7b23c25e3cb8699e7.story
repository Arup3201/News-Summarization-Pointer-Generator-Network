Harvard scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in discovering why neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's affect certain people in old age while others can live to 100 and not develop dementia.

The research, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, focused on a protein previously thought to act mostly in the brains of developing fetuses.

The scientists found that the protein, called REST, also appeared to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging-related stresses.

But in people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, the protein was sharply depleted in key brain regions.

‘Our work raises the possibility that the abnormal protein aggregates associated with Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases may not be sufficient to cause dementia; you may also need a failure of the brain's stress response system,’ said Bruce Yankner, Harvard Medical School professor of genetics and leader of the study.

‘If true, this opens up a new area in terms of treatment possibilities for the more than five million Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease,’ said Yankner, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate the toxic effects of amyloid beta, the hallmark abnormal protein in Alzheimer's.

The research underscores a different way of looking at neurodegenerative diseases.

Instead of focusing on the negative changes that cause disease, researchers examined trouble spots in the brain's ability to protect itself over time.

Yankner said the study suggests a person may be able to resist the toxic effects of Alzheimer's if REST levels remain high.

‘If we could activate this stress-resistance gene network with drugs, it might be possible to intervene in the disease quite early,’ he said.

But they cautioned that much more needed to be determined, including whether the decline of REST was a cause, or an effect, of brain deterioration, and whether it was specific enough to neurological diseases that it could lead to effective therapies.

He also has thoughts about a potential treatment, lithium, which he said appears to stimulate REST function, and is considered relatively safe.

As dementia rates rise, researchers believe preventive studies such as this will be critical in finding a cure. Some estimates say the number of people living with dementia will double to nearly 70 million by 2030.

'This is an extremely important study,' said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary accompanying the study.

'This is the first study that is really starting to provide a plausible pathway to explain why some people are more vulnerable to Alzheimer’s than other people.'
