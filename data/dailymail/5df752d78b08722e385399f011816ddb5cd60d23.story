It's believed Channel Seven's flagship current affairs show has lost two of its most experienced staff members, with reports on Friday that Sunday Night executive producer Mark Llewellyn has left his senior role after an office bust up.

The Daily Telegraph also reported that veteran journalist Ross Coulthart has quit after his office friends were allegedly involved in a physical bust up.

The fallout coming after claims Mark Llewellyn had pinned producer Paul Waterhouse against a wall at the network’s offices last month and Coulthart was forced to intervene,The Australian reported.

Mark Llewellyn has reportedly left his role as EP of Channel Seven's Sunday Night program over an alleged altercation with a fellow staff member three weeks ago. The network has stated he will return after extended leave to an EP role on 'prime time programming'

Channel Seven journalist Ross Coulthart has reportedly quit Sunday Night

The Daily Telegraph also claimed Coulthart walked out on the show last Friday because he was upset about the way the affair has been handled. 

A source told the paper Llewellyn had been under stress for some time: ‘Ross could see this coming to a head and had been flagging his fears for Mark with others for some time.’ 

Channel Seven has not responded to questions about the alleged bust-up

Llewellyn had reportedly first been suspended over the incident, which is believed to have happened on October 29, but has subsequently been informed of the network's decision by CEO, Tim Worner, according to the Daily Telegraph.

It is understood Waterhouse's conduct is not being investigated.  

Late on Friday Channel Seven provided the following statement:

'Sunday Night executive producer Mark Llewellyn is taking an extended period of leave.

'In 2015, Mark will return to the Network in an executive producer role working on prime time programming.

'Mark is the founding executive producer on Sunday Night, which first aired in 2009.'

Daily Mail Australia has also placed calls to Mr Llewellyn and Mr Coulthart seeking comment over the reports.

Coulthart is not the first veteran reporter thought to have quit Sunday Night this year.

In January, 62-year-old Mike Munro left the program to joined Channel 10. On 9 February he began work as the presenter of Ten Eyewitness News Weekend.
