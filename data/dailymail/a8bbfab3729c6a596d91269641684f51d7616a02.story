As newly trained Met Police officers, they wanted to look their best at their passing out parade, standing tall and proud in particularly shiny shoes.

But then yesterday’s weather intervened.

As temperatures soared to 70°F (21°C), it was too much for several graduates, standing to attention in heavy uniforms, hats and gloves.

One pale-looking policeman fainted and collapsed into colleagues while another crashed to the ground and had to be helped up by the hardier ranks behind.

Greeting the officers: Mayor Boris Johnson talks to some of the newly graduated police officers who have managed to stay standing

The ceremony, the largest ever Met 
Police passing out parade, saw 567  trainees graduate from Hendon Police
College in north London in front of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe
and London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Officers graduating included a special
constable who had saved a suicidal  man by holding onto the scruff of 
his  neck as he jumped off a bridge and another who had foiled a 
kidnap.

Others passed out completely and had to be escorted from the parade grounds by medical staff to receive treatment.

One unwell officer was determined to finish the ceremony but turned incredibly pale before collapsing into the arms of a colleague. He too then had to be helped inside by other officers.

It is unclear whether the officers were struggling to cope with the stifling heat from wearing their uniforms standing in the blazing sun as temperatures reached 20c or whether a group of the officers had fallen ill from something else.

Despite the interruptions the ceremony, which is the largest parade the Metropolitan Police service has ever held, was completed to welcome the 567 new officers.

Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'It is vital to invest in the Met police and I'll continue to fight hard for resources.

'I'm glad we have given so many Special Constables and PCSOs the opportunity to become fully warranted police officers. There is nothing more important than keeping our city safe and I'm confident these officers will serve our city well.'

One of the new officers, Special Constable Luxan Thurairatnasingam, saved the life of a suicidal man hanging off Kingston Bridge two years ago by holding onto the scruff of his neck.

Luxan, 27, based at Kingston police station, held onto the man for so long that his arm literally locked in place as he pulled him to safety.

Luxan, who is originally from Sri Lanka, said: 'I just held on tight as he tried to jump. He had been having personal problems and said he couldn't go on any longer.

'I told him to think about the impact on his family and said we would help him. I just did what anyone would have done. It's all in a day's work.'

Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, added: 'This is a great day for London. Another 567 officers to patrol the streets of the capital is a great achievement.

'This is an historic event and the number of officers passing out here today at Hendon is the highest ever. I wish them every success as they start on their careers with the Met, helping us to keep Londoners safe.'
