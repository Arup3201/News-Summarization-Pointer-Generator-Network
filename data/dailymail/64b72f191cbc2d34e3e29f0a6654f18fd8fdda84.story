The moment a flaming meteorite shot across the British night sky has been captured by a police car.

Stunned traffic officers spotted the ‘bolide’ meteor as they travelled on the M42 in the West Midlands at 03:00 BST on Monday.

The clip released by West Midlands Police shows the bright white flash of light hurtling across the sky in front on their vehicle.

The video was taken from a camera on the front of one of the force’s traffic cars as it left Junction 4 of the motorway near Shirley.

Posting the footage on their Twitter account, West Midlands Police said: 'We’re used to catching suspects on camera but on Mon we recorded this meteor fireball in the sky over @m42motorway.'

There is no official definition of a bolide, but it is generally taken to be a fireball.

It comes from the Greek 'bolis', which means missile.

Particularly
 bright meteors, such as the one spotted in the UK today, that burn up 
in the atmosphere are generally regarded as bolides.

Fireballs that explode in the upper atmosphere are also known as bolides.

Bolides that reach exceptional brightness are known as superbolides.

Experts said the meteor was spotted over the West Country, Wales and the West Midlands in the early hours of Monday morning.

The rock broke into pieces as it entered the earth’s atmosphere but did not cause any damage.

Spotting meteors like this is rare in the UK and astronomers said catching one on camera is a huge achievement.

The incredible sight was also captured by two cameras operated by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmoth, Devon.

This is the moment a flaming meteorite was captured shooting across the British night sky - from a camera in a police car. The meteorite is visible at about the 12.30 position in this image.

Dave Jones, of the UK Meteor Observation Network, said it was by far the largest fireball ever spotted by the observatory.

He added: 'We have two cameras that watch for meteors during darkness, so upon hearing the news I logged in to check our data and see if we had captured anything.

'Fortunately the meteor passed in front of both of our cameras so we ended up with two videos of the same event.

'Due to cloud and raindrops on the camera lenses the image was not as clear as we would like, however the sheer size and brightness of this object burning up in our atmosphere almost overwhelmed our cameras as it was so bright.'

The discovery was first made by cameras at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth, Devon at 03:04 BST on Monday.

Events such as this in the UK are rare, so spotting one on camera is a huge achievement.

Some eyewitnesses are reported to have said it was green in colour, and it was said to even cast shadows due to its brightness.

Astronomers at the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth heard reports that a massive shooting star had been spotted streaking across the sky in the early hours.

They rewound the observatory’s two fixed cameras and were thrilled to find a perfect clip of a flaming meteor arcing across the sky at 3:04 before disappearing behind clouds.

Built in 1912 and situated 15 miles south of Exeter, the Norman Lockyer Observatory is used by students, researchers and amateur astronomers.

Thanks to its coastal location and the lack of light pollution, it is renowned as one of the best places in the UK for spectral analysis.

A meteor has been spotted streaking over skies of the UK. It was caught on two camera operated by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmoth, Devon, shown here in this still from a video. It did not cause any damage but shows how vulnerable our planet can be to space rocks such as asteroids and comets

This meteor comes on the 106th anniversary of the Tunguska event. On 30 June 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the Tunguska River in Russia, believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding in the atmosphere. It flattened 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of forest (picture taken in 1929)

Meteors that enter our atmosphere often undergo this intense event as they are heated during re-entry.

On occasion rocks make it all the way through and impact the ground, forming craters.

More often than not though the debris merely burns up in the atmosphere, in some cases as a super-heated fireball known as a bolide.

Some even explode in the upper atmosphere and, if they’re big enough, can cause widespread damage like the Tunguska event 106 years ago.

On
 30 June 1908 a giant explosion occurred over the Tunguska River in 
Russia, believed to have been caused by an asteroid or comet exploding 
in the atmosphere.

The Tunguska event, as it would be known, flattened 770 square miles (2,000 square kilometres) of forest.

And
 on its 106th anniversary the UK has experienced a Tunguska event of its
 own, albeit on a much smaller scale.

An asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system. Most are located between Mars and Jupiter in the Main Belt.

A comet is a rock covered in ice, methane and other compounds. Their orbits take them much further out of the solar system.

A meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up.

This debris itself is known as a meteoroid. Most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere.

If any of this meteoroid makes it to Earth, it is called a meteorite.

Meteors, meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets.
