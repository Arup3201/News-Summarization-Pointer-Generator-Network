It's one of the best-known hits of his remarkable, 50-year career. And the words to Do Ya Think I’m Sexy may well have been running through Penny Lancaster’s head as she performed a raunchy, impromptu pole-dance for Rod Stewart on their holiday yacht.

The 68-year-old rocker couldn’t take his eyes off his 42-year-old model wife as, in cropped pink top and black jeans and with blonde hair flying, she cavorted in front of him.

Penny, the mother of two of Rod’s eight children, giggled as she gyrated round a deck post on the yacht during the Stewart family break in St Tropez in the South of France last week.

Moments earlier, the pair looked more like honeymooners than a married couple when they embraced for a smoochy dance.

Then Penny limbered up in front of Rod before discarding her pink sweater and throwing herself into action.

It’s possible that Penny was secretly hoping Rod would remember a few of her professional-looking dance moves – after he was spotted earlier in the holiday performing a bizarre routine of his own.

During a shore break with friends, Rod broke into a sequence of strange, robotic-type moves as he strolled along the quayside. Dressed in white shirt and trousers accompanied by a cricket-style cardigan, orange-and-white shoes and rock star shades, he had his companions in stitches as he walked along swinging his arms out to his sides and above his head.

Rod and his clan were clearly in high spirits during their Mediterranean break – but then he has had plenty to celebrate.

Rod’s new album Time, his first collection of self-penned songs for 20 years, hit the top of the charts last month.

And he has revealed that one of the tracks on it was inspired by the pain of a two-week separation from Penny after she walked out on him.

They enjoyed a subsequent reunion and are now clearly closer than ever.

During their break the couple visited the beach with their two children, seven-year-old Alastair and Aiden, three. At the beach, Penny displayed her sun-tanned physique to perfection when she bounced enthusiastically on a trampoline in a sporty kit of white shirt and matching shorts.

As the couple basked in the sunshine on the deck of their yacht, Rod, whose other hits include the worldwide No 1 Sailing, tweeted a picture of himself with his feet up, under the heading ‘Putting me sea legs to work’.

Penny is Rod’s third wife. He was married to model Rachel Hunter for 16 years until 2006, and to actress Alana Hamilton for five years until 1984.
