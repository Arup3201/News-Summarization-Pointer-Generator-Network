North American monarch butterflies migrate across the continent without an internal map, according to new research.

The butterflies travel from Canada and the United States to Mexico using basic orientation techniques and landmarks to find their way - as opposed to the internal maps they were previously though to use.

Researchers from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, believe that the insects also use an ‘internal compass’ which enables them to navigate to their wintering sites using the position of the sun and the Earth’s magnetic field.

The butterflies are found in North America, New Zealand, Australia and parts of Western Europe.

They have a wingspan of 8.9 to 10.2cm and are famous for their migration from Canada and the U.S. to Mexico and then back.

They start their southward migration with the first frost and then return in spring.

The length of the journey exceeds the lifespan of most butterflies - which is less than two months - so a full migration cycle involves a number of generations.

They migrate south because they cannot withstand freezing temperatures and they return north because the larval food plants they need do not grow in their overwintering sites.

The team analysed more than 50 years'
worth of migration data in an attempt to learn how monarchs find their 
way to their wintering habitat in Mexico – a journey they make just part of during their lifetime.

They discovered that when the butterflies are blown off course, they most likely use major geographic landmarks to help them get back on track.

The researchers believe that this is necessary as the butterflies cannot detect longitudinal displacements so would otherwise get lost on the journey.

To test whether monarchs could detect longitude displacements, the team, led by undergraduate student Rachael Derbyshire, examined the butterflies' flight patterns in a funnel on the University of Guelph campus. They then tested the same monarchs in Calgary.

‘The monarchs we tested in Guelph flew southwest, in the general direction of Mexico,’ said Ms Derbyshire. ‘When we tested them in Calgary, they flew in the same general direction as if they were in Ontario, suggesting that they did not know they had been displaced 2,500 kilometres.’

The team also studied data from monarchs tagged and recaptured throughout North America from 1952 to 2004, and found that migrating monarchs do not use an internal map to reach Mexico.

Instead, they use landmarks, such as coastlines and the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains.‘Given the challenge of this migratory journey and the fact that these insects are less than a gram, it is a remarkably simple system they used to travel thousands of kilometres to a site they have never seen,’ said Professor Ryan Norris.

Despite the new findings, one question remains unanswered – monarch butterflies use the same sites in the highlands of central Mexico each year but no one knows exactly how they pinpoint these exact locations.

Ms Derbyshire said: ‘One possibility we think is likely, and would need to be tested, is that they - like some other migratory animals - use smell to guide them to their final destination.’
