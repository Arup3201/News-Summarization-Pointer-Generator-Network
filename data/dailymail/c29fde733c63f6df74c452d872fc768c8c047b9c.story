Gonorrhea and syphilis are on the rise in the United States, according to a new report from the centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC reports the 'troubling rise' in syphilis affects men who have sex with men disproportionately, while the increase in gonorrhea cases are predominantly in young men and women between the ages of 15 and 24.

It is estimated that nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections occur every year in the U.S. and half of those are in people 15 to 24.Â 

High risk: The CDC says the rise is due to inadequate testing due to homophobia and the stigma surrounding STDs and limited access to healthcare

The CDC says its annual surveillance only captures a fraction of the 'true burden of STDs in America,' since many cases go undiagnosed and unreported.

According to the report, there were 15,667 cases of syphilis reported in 2012, making an 11.1 per cent increase since 2011. However, the increase was solely among men, particularly gay and bisexual men.

The data shows that men who have sex with men account for 75 per cent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases.

Disproportionate: The CDC says 75 per cent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occur in men who have sex with men

Primary and secondary syphilis are the earliest and most infectious stages of the disease. The disease is easily treated in these stages.

In the primary stage, a single round, firm and painless sore will appear at the location where syphilis entered the body.

If left untreated, the secondary stage will bring rashes in one or more areas of the body as well as fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, hair loss, headaches, aches and fatigue.

Late-stage syphilis can result in death.

The report says that the disparities in the sexual health of gay and bisexual men can be explained by many social and cultural factors.

On the rise: Sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea and chlamydia are most common among people aged 15 to 24

While individual risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex, play a role, other factors such as limited access to high-quality healthcare due to homophobia and stigma around STDs.

Bacterial diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea make it easier for people to acquire serious viral infections, such as HIV.

There were 334,826 cases of gonorrhea reported in 2012, a 4.1 per cent increase since 2011.

Young people account for more than half of the annual cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia, the report showed.

Women face a particular long-term risk, since it is estimated that undiagnosed STDs cause 24,000 women to become infertile each year.

According to the report, STDs cost the U.S. healthcare system $16 billion every year.
