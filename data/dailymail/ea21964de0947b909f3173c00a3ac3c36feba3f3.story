ITV was today forced to defend its latest episode of Downton Abbey after viewers were left ‘distressed and disgusted’ when one of the drama's best-loved characters was beaten up and raped.

At least thirty people have complained to TV watchdog Ofcom about the violent scene involving housemaid Anna Bates, with some accusing writers of using a sexual assault to 'spice up' the show.

Others watching last night said that the decision to feature violence against women as a key plotline was ‘morally reprehensible’.

But ITV said a message was played before the show aired warning it contained ‘violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting’, while Downton's makers said it was 'acted and directed with great sensitivity'.

Shocking: Downton Abbey viewers were left stunned after a brutal rape scene during Sunday night's episode

In shock: The ITV1 audience was warned about the violent scenes ahead of the show, but Downton Abbey fans have complained they were still not prepared for what happened

In a dramatic episode yesterday Mrs Bates, played by Joanne Froggatt, is confronted by Mr Green during the scene who attempts to kiss the married maid against her will.

But when Mrs Bates wrestles off the guest valet, played by former Eastenders actor Nigel Harman, he punches the maid in the face, knocking her to the ground.

As Mrs Bates screams in agony, she is
 then dragged into a room and pushed over a table by the male character,
 who was making his first appearance in the hit series.

Started so well: At the beginning of the show, Mr Green seemed like an amiable addition to the Downton Abbey staff

While
 the episode did not explicitly show any sexual violence, screaming and 
the sound of further striking could clearly be heard as an exterior shot
 of the room was shown while the assault was taking place.

A
 hysterical Mrs Bates appeared in a later scene looking extremely 
distressed with cuts and bruises on her face as she begged a fellow 
servant for help.

Despite being aired after the 
official watershed of 9pm, when scenes of a violent nature can be shown.
 members of the public said they were offended by the nature of the 
images.

Defending the storyline a Downton Abbey spokesman said:'The complex and loving journey of Anna and Bates has been central to the narrative of the show. The events in episode three were we believe acted and directed with great sensitivity. Viewers will see in the forthcoming episodes how Anna and Bates struggle to come to terms with what has happened.'

An ITV spokesman added: 'A warning alerting viewers to scenes they may find upsetting was broadcast before the episode aired.'

Nigel Harman admitted today it was 'a shocking storyline' as he appeared on This Morning and added it was 'something that when I was sent the script and read it I was amazing by and excited by, if that's the right word.'

He continued to defend the rape sequence saying 'for a show like Downton Abbey it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea.'

One viewer said 
they were so shocked by the scene that they planned to make an official 
complaint to the broadcast regulator Ofcom.

Writing
 on Twitter, viewer Alexia Light also said that Downton Abbey’s creator 
Julian Fellowes owed viewers an apology over the ‘sick and 
sensationalist’ scene.

Another viewer Caroline Farrow described the ‘scenes of sexual violence’ as ‘very distressing’.

She added: ‘Apparently @DowntonAbbey 
did give a generic warning of violence prior to the start. Mea culpa. 
But still rather nasty nonetheless.’

One
 viewer, referring to themselves as Gehenna, wrote on Twitter: ‘For family drama Downton Abbey to use violence against women as a plot 
point is morally reprehensible.

‘I can’t support Julian Fellowes in depicting rape in a show that treats missing tuxedo shirts as a major crisis.’

@bidisha_online tweeted: ‘What is it with male writers scribbling in a 
quick rape of a woman to spice things up? ITV/Downton raped a woman and 
can never take it back.’

Now
 in its fourth series, Downton Abbey is one of the most popular dramas 
on British television, attracting a peak audience of 10.5million when it
 returned to screens last month.

The series, starring Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, has only previously fallen foul of broadcasting rules after featuring a mini dramas to promote the show’s sponsor.

The ten second credits for insurance giant Aviva ran at the beginning and end of commercial breaks, enraging viewers who complained that they were depressing and ruined the programme.

Ofcom ruled that some scenes contained an ‘advertising message’ which is not allowed in sponsorship promotions.

ITV has also faced accusations of swamping viewers with ad breaks, with up to one minute of promotions for every three of Downton Abbey.

Viewers have also accused the award-winning series, set in a Yorkshire estate in the early 20th century, of historical inaccuracy over its use of modern language in scripts.
