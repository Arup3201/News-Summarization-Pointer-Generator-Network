Proposals: Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £2 million

Tens of thousands of homes will be hit by a reformed ‘mansion tax’ shortly after the general election under Liberal Democrat plans.

Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £2 million.

But nine in ten of those forced to pay the extra levy would live in London and the South East - in houses rather than mansions - thanks to soaring property prices.

Mr Alexander however played down the impact on homeowners, saying that those in receipt of council tax benefit or who were on low incomes could be exempt or get discounts.

But he admitted the policy would ‘release a wee bit of steam’ from the top end of the housing market.

Pensioners who have expensive homes but low incomes would be able to defer the tax until after their death, aides to Mr Alexander later said.

The new levy would be paid in addition to ordinary council tax. Although local authorities would collect the levy, the revenue would go straight to the Treasury.

However the reform is a partial climb down for the Lib Dems, who planned to introduce a flat one per cent tax on properties worth more than £2 million for every pound over that threshold.

Mr Alexander told a business audience that his new proposal had been subjected to Treasury modelling and would be a ‘modest, additional banded levy on top of council tax for high value properties’.

‘The annual charges, in addition to council tax will be set out in good time ahead of the general election next year.’

He added: ‘By building on the council tax system, there will be no need for a detailed valuation of the small proportion of properties affected. Crucially, this means that this policy could be implemented quickly after the election.’

Mr Alexander added that ‘with the level of the bands up rated annually, people living in typical family homes need have no fear of being sucked into this levy.’

A revaluation has been put off by successive governments, as it would be hugely expensive, politically unpopular and force thousands of home owners into higher bands.

Under the new plans, anyone in a house under £2 million would continue to pay council tax as usual and face no extra levy.

Concentrated: According to figures from property website Zoopla, more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £2 million are in a single London borough - Kensington and Chelsea

Mr Alexander - who is tipped as a potential successor to Nick Clegg as leader of the Lib Dems - will not set out the bands until closer to the general election.

But he did cite an example of an £8 million home which might fall into a band of £5 million to £10 million.

The Cabinet minister said the broader bands would ensure there were fewer challenges about the valuations of homes.

He had feared that the previous Lib Dem policy of would lead to a wave of appeals against property valuations.

But according to figures from property website Zoopla, more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £2 million are in a single London borough - Kensington and Chelsea.

A further 31 per cent are in the boroughs of Westminster and Camden.

Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said: ‘Homeowners in London and the South East already pay the lion’s share of UK property taxes with the stamp duty thresholds placing a heavy burden already on higher priced properties.’

Promises: Ed Miliband has pledged to introduce mansion tax if he becomes Prime Minister

Nearly 11,000 homes worth more than £2 million are outside the capital but in the South East, according to the research drawn from Land Registry figures.

Mr Alexander’s new mansion tax would raise an estimated £1.2 billion a year.

This is less than the £1.7 billion to £2 billion previously cited by both the Lib Dems and Labour.

Ed Miliband has also pledged to introduce a mansion tax if he becomes prime minister.

The British Property Federation had previously warned that a flat one per cent mansion tax on properties over £2 million could be turned into a political football and deter investment and development. But it welcomed the new proposals.

Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: ‘We are delighted that the Lib Dems are taking this much more sensible approach to the Mansion Tax. The council tax system remains in principle a better way of taxing property, if the valuations on which it is based are up-to-date.

‘At present we have a property tax that is based on 1991 values, when the average house in the UK was worth, £62,000, the Soviet Union was still in existence and Bryan Adams topped the charts. Adding some additional bands of council tax makes sense as a sticking-plaster measure, but ultimately if fairness is politicians’ goal then only a full revaluation in conjunction with more bands will do this. ‘
