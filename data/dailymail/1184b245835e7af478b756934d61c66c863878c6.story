Hannah Anderson is set to speak for the first time about her terrifying kidnap ordeal where her captor zip-tied her, forced the teenager to play Russian roulette then murdered her mother and brother.

The 16-year-old from California says she feels 'shocked, sick and angry' following her abduction by neighbor James Lee DiMaggio.

The teenager spoke to the Today show with her father in an interview to air on Thursday. She traveled to New York for the taping from which she excitedly posted pictures on her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live performance.

The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on Monday from the airport in New York

Miss Anderson told presenter Savannah Guthrie that things took a horrifying turn when DiMaggio brought her to his home on August 3.

DiMaggio handcuffed and zip-tied her feet, telling her in detail how he was going to abduct her and take her to Idaho.

The schoolgirl added that her role was to carry her kidnapper's backpacks and that he would 'get me home afterwards'.

The teenager described her fear when DiMaggio forced her to play a game of Russian roulette with a gun while her mother and brother were in the house. When she started to cry, he said they could stop the game.

Her mother and little brother were killed when DiMaggio's house burst into flames after he rigged it with explosives. 

Never forgotten: The teenager posted this picture in tribute to her little brother Ethan who would have celebrated his 9th birthday on Monday

Remembering the other victims: Hannah regularly posts old pictures of her mother Christina and brother Ethan, both of whom were killed by her captor before he fled with her to Idaho

After a week of extensive searches, Miss Anderson was rescued by FBI agents in 
Idaho on August 10 after DiMaggio was killed in a shootout.

One of the riders who alerted authorities after coming across the 
teenage girl and her captor in the wilderness told the Today Show that there was 
'pure fear' in the girl's eyes.

During
 her short trip to New York City this week, the San Diego school girl updated her followers on 
Instagram with pictures of her hotel room and a montage of photos and video
 clips of Miley Cyrus. She 
told the followers that she got a hug from the singer.

The teenager paid tribute to her little brother Ethan on Monday on what would have been his 9th birthday.

As
 part of a longer message, the grieving teenager wrote: 'Sorry for 
blowing up your instas but I wanna say happy birthday to little E.

Today
 he would have turned 9. And it breaks my heart to think how excite he 
was to celebrate it. He was always ready for his birthday and knew his 
plans a year before. I love you Ethan there's not a day I don't go 
without missing you.'

Hannah Anderson excitedly shared a montage of Miley Cyrus pictures from the Today Show on which she is set to appear on Thursday

Hannah Anderson has come under fire since being rescued from her horrifying ordeal as she made a semi-public re-entry to the world via social media.

She began answering questions from 
friends and strangers on social media site Ask.fm, and in some remarks 
the strain of the continued interest in the case is beginning to show.

When
 one woman asked Anderson why did she 'never run' away from her captor 
James DiMaggio- saying that 'he never have you handcuff or anything- 
Anderson snapped back.

'How do you know he never had me 
handcuffed? Because there you are wrong. Don't assume things you don't 
know. Just stop,' she wrote.

In
 another, a user accused her father of 'mooching off other people' and 
she responded: 'Why don't you shut the f*** up and get the facts right. 
He's trying a******. Why don't you get a life instead harassing people? 
(sic)'

Memories: Hannah Anderson has posted pictures of her family on Instagram following her ordeal where her young brother and mother (right) were killed

Signs of trouble: She regularly posts inspirational messages hinting at her inner anguish

Anderson is an active user on Instagram, regularly posting smiling selfies with friends to her nearly 9,000 followers.

There have been hints of emotional struggles, however, as she regularly posts old pictures of her mother Tina and brother Ethan, both of whom were tied, beaten and their bodies burnt.

'Just because i am strong enough to handle PAIN doesn't mean i deserve it [sic],' read one recent post.

Some of that pain is self-inflicted, as she admitted to reading the autopsy report about the deaths where the medical examiner detailed the way in which they were beaten before DiMaggio set the house on fire and drove off with Hannah.

She said that 'I need to know what happened to them'.

The question-and-answer style social media site Ask.fm is popular among teens but it has been gaining a larger audience as it has been cited in a number of cases of bullying that have resulted in suicides.

Happier moments: Anderson shared these pictures of herself and her boyfriend at their homecoming dance

Grieving: Hannah posted this picture with her brother Ethan and this message: 'Can't get you off my mind tonight. Miss you so much. I just wanna see you so bad. It's not the same and it never will be. I love you with all my heart'

Anderson's conversation shows that she is a target for such internet trolls as well, with a number taking issue with the smiling, cheery photos that she has posted in the days and weeks following the family tragedy.

Another told her to 'stop editing your pics, it's not a good looks for you'.

Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho days after kidnapping her from California

'Sad that you don't even know me and run your mouth but I give you props for having balls to talk s*** over ask lol,' she responded.

Another talking point was the optics of how she walked into the memorial fundraiser for her mother and brother wearing short jean shorts and holding a cup from Starbucks.

'My friend randomly showed up with Starbucks and I guess she got me one,' Anderson wrote in one post, and continued by saying in another: 'Yeah it's stupid what was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me? People just find the littlest reasons to bash on me (sic).'

Her social media presence shows that in spite of days where she says it ‘just doesn’t feel real’, there have been some more light-hearted moments in her life of late.

Anderson attended her school’s 
homecoming dance in an embellished pink dress, and posted pictures of 
herself kissing her new boyfriend that she started dating a month ago.

Those
 moments of teenage milestones hide the apparent pain that she continues
 to go through, she says that she regularly breaks down in the evenings 
and uses her happiness during the day as a way to project a better 
image.

Adored: Hannah posted these pictures of her little brother Ethan with the words 'miss you' and 'my angel'

Watching her back: Anderson has faced critics online and at school, as many have raised questions about her behavior in the days and weeks following her return

Timing: Anderson said that the reason she had Starbucks at her mother and brother's funeral was because a friend got it for her. 'What was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me?'

‘I break down all the time. I don’t like crying I front of people [sic]. I’m the type of person that makes sure everyone else’s feelings are ohkay [sic] before I take care of mine. Sorry I don’t take pics of me crying? That makes me a bad person I guess,’ she wrote on Ask.fm.

DiMaggio was killed by the agents when they found he and Anderson in the woods of Idaho. He has been ruled as the sole suspect but questions arose when investigators found correspondence between he and the teen prior to the kidnapping.

San Diego Sheriff Bill Gore reiterated that in spite of the unexpected evidence, Anderson is ‘a victim in every sense of the word’.
