Mystery: Sylvie Cachay, 33, was discovered, half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at around 3am on December 9 2011. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand

A celebrated swimsuit designer found dead in the bath in one of New York's most exclusive members' clubs sent an expletive-laden email to her boyfriend a day before her death, accusing him of stealing from her credit card and threatening to go to police, it has been claimed.

Sylvie Cachay, 33, was discovered, half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at around 3 a.m. on December 9 2011. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand.

But on the eve of her tragic death, she sent a message to ex-boyfriend Nicholas Brooks, 25, with 'F*** you' written in the title field, a court has heard.

The revelation comes as Brooks, who is the son of late Oscar-winning composer and alleged sex attacker Joseph Brooks, awaits trial accused of her murder.

The email, with the subject line 'F*** You', was revealed by prosecutors as they applied to a judge to include it as evidence in the long-awaited trial.

'The subject line was "F*** you," and it said she was going to the police, and that’s relevant,' prosecutor Jordan Arnold told a court as he tried to argue that the District Attorney did nothing wrong in plundering Brooks' email account for clues.

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner agreed that it would be in the public interest to disclose the contents of his emails to a jury.

It is well known that Brooks and Cachay,
whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities including 
Lindsay Lohan, had a stormy seven-month relationship.

But Brooks' defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffman told the New York Post that the email is inadmissible, adding: 'This is nothing more than a given feeling at a given moment that was different two moments before and two moments after.'

On the night of her death, Miss Cachay and Brooks checked 
into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left 
her there to die while he went to party.

Ms Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts.

She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Syla, her own label.

Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault.

He was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes.

However, he committed suicide before his case or his son's could go to trial.

The elder Brooks left no money to his children and was nearly broke when he died, the New York Post reported.

It's unclear whether the proceeds of his biggest hit, which still rakes in royalties, will go to his son.Prosecutors say surveillance footage show Brooks went into and out of Miss Cachay's room several times before finally leaving it after the she was dead.

After his arrest, Brooks asked cops if he needed to hire protection in prison, saying he had seen 'Oz,' an HBO television show about life behind bars.

'How long can I get for something like this?' he reportedly asked detectives.

He's facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted.
