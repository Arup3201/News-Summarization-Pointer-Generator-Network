The husband of a teacher who spent the night with a 16-year-old pupil has told how she seduced the boy as revenge after he had an affair.

Bernadette Smith, 35, narrowly avoided a prison sentence this week after confessing her infatuation with her student Gary Ralston.

The court heard how she called the boy into her classroom at Banockburn High School in Stirling, and confessed her feelings for him. The pair later kissed passionately in a park, and spent the night in bed, where Smith wore just jeans and a bra.

Abuse of trust: Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told Smith (left), 35, 
who kissed Gary, then 16, (right) and lay beside him wearing only jeans and a
 bra, that she had committed a serious abuse of trust. She was spared jail

Waived anonymity: Gary, now 17, in his bedroom where one of the incidents took place. He said his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school

Now Brian Smith, 35, has revealed how 
his wife, with whom he has three children, told him she seduced the boy 
as punishment for his affair in 2004.

'She said I deserved it, that this was payback. I’ve hit a brick wall trying to explain or understand it', he told the Daily Record.

'I
 maybe could have understood if she had gone with another teacher, or a 
neighbour, to get back at me. But not a boy, never. Not someone in her 
care.'

He told how his wife disappeared for a night with the boy, and sent him a text telling him their relationship had to end.

She then switched off her phone, leaving him to desperately try and track her down. She came home the next day while he was getting their children ready for school and confessed the affair.

His wife was later arrested and taken to court, where this week she admitted engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust.

She was sentenced to two years of supervision at Stirling Sheriff Court, and will be on the sex offenders' register for the same period of time.

Mr Smith, a bus driver, added that he does not blame Gary for what happened, as he was a 'victim' and only did what he was told.

The affair started in Smith's classroom at Bannockburn High School, Stirling, where she confessed her feelings to the boy, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss

The pupil, who waived his anonymity to speak of the relationship, said Smith had been his favourite teacher before she targeted him for particular attention.

He
 said: ‘I was thinking I was quite lucky. A lot of the boys fancied her.
 I couldn’t believe she was with me. It was the last thing I expected. 
She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn’t help the way she  
was feeling.’

Placing the 
mother of three under a supervision order yesterday, Sheriff Wyllie 
Robertson told her she had committed a serious abuse of trust.

He said it was only the fact that she had not gone further with the boy that had saved her from a jail sentence.

Gary
 revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during 
third, fourth and fifth year, began during secret meetings  at school.

‘When
 I started year six, Bernadette was no longer my teacher, but we’d pass 
each other in the corridor, say hello and smile,’ he said. He said that 
Smith later summoned him to her classroom.

‘I
 walked in and as soon as I sat down she said, “Ever since we’ve been 
back at school and I’ve seen you around, I’ve been realising I have 
feelings for you”,’ he said.

Sexual misconduct: Bernadette Smith, left and right leaving court, drove the boy to a park and kissed him

Describing himself as ‘curious’ and ‘excited’, Gary agreed to meet the history and English teacher on September 13 last year.

The pair drove to a park in Falkirk, Scotland, and went for a walk but when they got back to the car, Smith kissed him passionately.

Gary said he worried for Smith’s job, husband and family but said she ‘didn’t seem too bothered’.

He confided in his father, who warned him to be careful but his grandmother called Bannockburn High School to complain. Smith was suspended immediately.

Despite their relationship being made public, they stayed together the next night at Gary’s home in Cowie.

Gary said: ‘We got ready for bed and I felt nervous. I got into bed with my boxers on. She took off her top, but kept her bra and jeans on, and slid in beside me.

‘We cuddled and talked – nothing else happened.’

His father Richard Ralston, 42, said: ‘I wasn’t pleased about what happened, but you’re an adult at 16 in Scotland so I didn’t want to interfere too much.

‘I want Gary to make decisions and learn from any mistakes.’

Prosecutor Ann Orr told Stirling Sheriff Court that when interviewed, Smith said ‘she loved the boy and they both wanted to be together’. She admitted kissing Gary and staying the night in  his bedroom.

There was no suggestion that Gary had suffered any long-term harm, the court was told.

Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust, between September 13 and 20 last year.

Gary, now 17, revealed how his relationship with Smith, who was his teacher during his third, fourth and fifth years, blossomed during secret meetings at Bannockburn high school

She was placed under supervision for two years and will remain on the sex offenders’ register for the same period.

Her solicitor, Andrew Gibb, said she was suspended by the General Teaching Council for Scotland and would be struck off at a hearing in a few weeks’ time. She has also separated from her husband.

Sheriff Robertson told the court Smith’s conduct was towards the lesser end of the offending scale, adding: ‘It is serious enough of course when a teacher admits this kind of conduct towards a pupil.

'We expect teachers to ensure children under their care are safe from abuse and that has not happened.’

He told Smith that it may have been that ‘difficulties within your marriage contributed to this aberration’, but he said many other teachers coped without resorting to such ‘bizarre’ behaviour.

He said it was to her ‘credit’ that she had not blamed her victim and she was assessed as at low risk of re-offending.  He ordered her to return to court on November 12 for a supervision order review.
