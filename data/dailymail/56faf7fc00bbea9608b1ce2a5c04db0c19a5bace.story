It appears some holidaymakers have had it with queues at airport security checkpoints and the stringent rules designed to protect them.

Three quarters of Britons are slamming airport security rules or processes as ‘unnecessary and ineffective,’ a new study says.

Almost a quarter of travellers believe rules that require them to remove their shoes, belts and jewellery while passing through security are an unnecessary hassle, while 42 per cent believe the security process could be better organised.

Pat down: 28 per cent of travellers get annoyed at the length of time they need to wait at security checkpoints

And only 22 per cent have complete confidence in the process and staff, according to a poll of 2,000 people by UK travel add-on provider Holiday Extras.

Passing through pre-flight security is rated one of the most stressful and unpleasant things by holidaymakers.

A fifth of Britons saying it’s the worst thing about going on holiday.

Airport security queues and processes create stress for one in five travellers with 28 per cent saying that they get downright annoyed at the length of time they need to wait, the study says. 

Anthony Clarke-Cowell, spokesman for Holiday Extras, said: ‘Security queues are a necessary evil of airline travel, but there are things that we can all do to make the process less tiresome. 

Almost a quarter of aren't satisfied with rules requiring them to remove their shoes, belts and jewellery

‘We recommend travellers familiarise themselves with the regulations completely, prepare their electrical items and liquid bags in advance and consider a Security Fast Track pass to speed them through with a dedicated lane.’

Holidaymakers are facing a new security guideline this summer in light of an apparent terror threat.

All passengers flying into or out of the UK and US will now have to prove that their electronic devices, including mobile phones, in their hand luggage are sufficiently charged to be switched on.
