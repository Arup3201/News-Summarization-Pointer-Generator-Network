Coca Cola has been the top sponsor of American Idol since day one, from the crowning of Kelly Clarkson in 2002 up to the win of Caleb Johnson earlier this year.

But after 13 seasons, the soft drink giant has ended its relationship with the talent show, announcing it is tome for the 'brand to venture into new spaces and pursue other opportunities'.

The news comes on the back of a major reported drop in advertising spending, with figures falling from $781.9 million in 2012 to $394.7 million in 2014 - a loss of $387.2 million, according to Variety.

It also follows confirmation the show will be 'merged' from two nights a week to one when it returns for its 14th series in January.

Shock change: Coca-Cola, a mainstay brand on American Idol since its debut in 2002, has now pulled out of the show after 13 years

'I can confirm that Coca-Cola and Fox have mutually decided to end our 13-year partnership,' a Coke representative  told E! News. 

'After 13 years, we feel it is the right time for the Coca-Cola brand to venture into new spaces and pursue other opportunities to connect with teens and leverage music as a passion point.'

The company would not further elaborate on its new plans for music marketing. 

AT&T, another longtime sponsor, also pulled its funding from Idol this year.

Ratings for the once-insurmountable talent quest have progressively fallen over the years.

For this year's winner's announcement and finale, 10.5 viewers tuned in.

However at its peak, Idol commanded an audience of 38 million.

That figure was registers when Ruben Studdard beat out Clay Aiken in season two. 

The show's host, Ryan Seacrest, recently revealed that, like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With The Stars, Idol will combine its performance and results shows into one.

The current judges - Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. - will all return.

Lopez has been on the program for four years and Urban for three, while new recruit Connick Jr. is returning for his second season. 

'Mentor' Randy Jackson, a former judge, has announced he is not returning.

Idol will premiere on Wednesday January 7.

Sources have told The Hollywood Reporter that Idol is close to signing off on a new sponsor to replace Coca Cola.

Idol's other leading sponsor, Ford, has confirmed it will return in 2015.

Flashback: Coke was been a leading sponsor on Idol since the first season in 2002, which Kelly Clarkson won

New precedent: The placement of Coke cups on the judge's tables during the first Idol season started a whole new wave of television advertising. Seen here is (L-R) Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell

According to Variety, the initial partnership between Coke and Idol was considered a 'huge risk'.

Amid a major advertising interruption caused by digital television, Coke crossed what was a strong boundary at the time, putting cups on the Idol judge's tables and noticeable placements elsewhere on set.

The move set a new precedent for brands to align themselves within a live show and one that proved beneficial for Coca Cola, until now. 

Current lineup: Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez and Harry Connick Jr. will return  in 2015, but Coke won't
