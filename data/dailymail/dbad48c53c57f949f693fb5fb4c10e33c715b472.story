A British animal lover spared no expense when she spent £2,500 to rescue a stray cat from a life on the streets in China.

Angela Burrell, 33, of Warsett Crescent, Skelton, in Teesside, spotted the homeless cat Kandinsky during her five years in China teaching English.

She has now admitted her good turn has cost her about £2,500 in injections, treatments and flights. But she says the cat is a friend for life and worth every penny.

Ms Burrell has been working in the north east of China, close to Beijing, on an intensive International TEFL programme, teaching English as part of a foreign language course.

She spotted Kandinsky - named after a friend and a Russian artist - in the street, mewing and feeling sorry for himself.

The black and white stray stole her heart with his friendly character and white face and socks.

Ms Burrell said: 'He was feeling very sorry for himself and I decided I wanted to bring him back home to Skelton with me.

'But he had to pass a blood test and in January this year I got him all his jabs and permissions.

'It's no longer necessary to quarantine cats now as the regulations have changed.

'I believe I'm the first person in that area of China to do this.'

Sparing no cost, Kandinsky flew home to Britain first class in the hold via British Airways, while Ms Burrell took a far cheaper Russian airline flight, changing at Moscow.

She said: 'My sister Jo came to meet us at Heathrow. She's also an animal lover and recently started a dog walking and pet house sitting business based in Guisborough.

'He was feeling very sorry for himself and I decided I wanted to bring him back home to Skelton with me'

'Kandinsky's about two years old and is very affectionate. My apartment in China was tiny so he's been enjoying the space in Skelton in our garden.

'I take him out in a harness and everyone loves it. It's been an adventure, but it's great now I've got him back to the UK.'

Ms Burrell was volunteering with animal charity Pet100 and acknowledges the help she received in China.

Next, Kandinsky will be travelling to America in the next few months when Ms Burrell meets up with her boyfriend Abe Bazan to work out there, again teaching English.

Ms Burrell is currently living at home with father Peter, 74, and mother Barbara, 63. She also has two sisters Jo, 31 and Heather, 29, who lives in Amsterdam.

A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed that if people follow the rules to the letter regarding cats, quarantine is no longer needed.
