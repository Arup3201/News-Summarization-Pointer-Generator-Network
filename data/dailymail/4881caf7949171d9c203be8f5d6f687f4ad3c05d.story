Is there another fixture in the football calendar that encapsulates the two ends of the Premier League spectrum better than Burnley versus Chelsea? West London chic meets old Lancashire grit.

This time last year, Burnley were playing Yeovil Town at a half-empty Turf Moor. Sean Dyche’s team were among the favourites for relegation from the Championship and their supporters could never have dreamed what lay ahead.

On Monday night, the old place will be packed to the rafters in front of a global television audience for the visit of Jose Mourinho’s multi-millionaires.

Expensive acquisition: Chelsea's new star man Diego Costa arrived for £32m this summer

Contrast: One man who will mark Costa, Michael Duff (left), cost just £30,000 and Burnley's main striker Danny Ings (right), the man who fired them to promotion, cost just £900,000

It has inevitably drawn comparisons with Burnley’s only other appearance in the Premier League when the Clarets shocked Manchester United 1-0 in their home opener under the floodlights at Turf Moor five years ago.

The stands literally shook when Robbie Blake hammered home the winner that night, and it will be no different if Dyche’s team pull off another shock against Chelsea. On paper, the chances of that look slim but this is the Premier League after all.

The difference in value between the two probable starting line-ups is quite staggering; more than £200million spent by Chelsea compared to the £5m it has cost to assemble this Burnley team; a multi-national side made up of World Cup and Champions League winners against a bunch of free signings, Premier League journeymen and cast-offs from the big clubs brought together by the inspirational Dyche; Mourinho against the man they call The Ginger Mourinho.

No wonder Dyche’s players have been seeing a sports psychologist to prepare them for the mental battle of staying up.

BURNLEY - £5.080m

Tom Heaton (free); Kieran Trippier (£450,000), Jason Shackell (£1.1m), Michael Duff (£30,000), Ben Mee (£600,000); Scott Arfield (free), Dean Marney (£500,000), David Jones (free), Matt Taylor (free); Danny Ings (£900,000), Lukas Jutkiewicz (£1.5m).

CHELSEA - £206.6m

Thibaut Courtois (£7.8m); Branislav Ivanovic (£9m), Gary Cahill (£7m), John Terry (academy), Filipe Luis (£16m); Nemanja Matic (£21m), Ramires (£19.8m); Willian (£32m), Cesc Fabregas (£30m), Eden Hazard (£32m); Diego Costa (£32m).

A few of them have extensive Premier League experience such as David Jones, Dean Marney, Matt Taylor and new signing Stephen Ward. Others have played briefly in the top-flight but some will never have come up against the type of opposition they face on Monday.

Nothing sums up the gulf in resources better than the contest between Burnley’s veteran defender Michael Duff and Chelsea’s new signing Diego Costa.

Duff, 36, has played in all top six tiers of English football and is celebrating 10 years at Turf Moor after joining the Clarets in 2004 from Cheltenham for £30,000. Chelsea paid 1,067 times more than that to buy Costa, 25, from Atletico Madrid for £32m following his appearance for Spain at the World Cup.

Mourinho also brought in Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis as part of a £78m summer transfer spend, while Dyche’s biggest extravagance was the £1.5m he paid Middlesbrough for striker Lukas Jutkiewicz.

Burnley captain Jason Shackell, who will partner Duff in central defence against Costa, has no doubt the veteran Northern Irishman is up to the challenge.

‘Duffo encapsulates everything about the team,’ said Shackell, who also had a brief spell in the Premier League with Norwich. ‘He’s really worked his way up and he deserves his opportunity.

‘We had the best defensive record last year and that’s an incredible achievement, especially in your mid-30s. There’s no reason why it should stop now. He’s fitter than some players I’ve seen who are 10 years his junior. I have every confidence he’s going to do great.

‘Costa is obviously a fantastic player. For Chelsea to spend that kind of money on him he’s got to be a great player, and I’m sure he’ll light up the Premier League at some stage this year.

‘We’re really looking forward to testing ourselves against him. You have to step up in all areas of your game. We’re playing against some of the best players and I think the biggest thing for me when I played in there previously was if you make a mistake you’re going to get punished.

‘But it’s the same as last year and we were underdogs then. It brings a certain freedom and freedom can be a powerful thing. With the pressure off there’s no weight on our shoulders. We can go out there and give everything and see what happens.’ 

Duff is the only survivor from the last Burnley side to play Chelsea at Turf Moor in January 2010. John Terry’s 82nd-minute header proved decisive in a 2-1 win that day, and Terry, Petr Cech, Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic (who played in his first spell at Stamford Bridge) will be back on Monday night.

Nothing much has changed in the meantime. Chelsea are still among the leading title contenders and Burnley are still favourites for relegation – but the Premier League can still throw up a big surprise.
