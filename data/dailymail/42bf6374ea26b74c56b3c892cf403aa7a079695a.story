Mauricio Pochettino is set to keep faith with Michel Vorm for Tottenham's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sheffield United, despite the goalkeeper's costly error against Leicester City.

Spurs travel to Bramall Lane with a 1-0 advantage, but come in on the back of being dumped out of the FA Cup  on Saturday.

Back-up keeper Vorm was at fault for Jeffrey Schlupp's  fourth round injury-time winner at White Hart Lane but the Spurs boss has suggested he has no plans to recall No 1 Hugo Lloris.

Mauricio Pochettino is not planning on recalling No 1 Hugo Lloris to the first team

‘I think it should be normal to play Michel,' Pochettino said. 'This is football. All games are important. He had a good performance.

‘He made two big saves against Leicester. His attitude is fantastic and nothing has changed. In one action he conceded a goal. He made a mistake. Every player can make a mistake, we must give him support and confidence.’

Despite his willingness to rest Lloris, who is arguably the best player in Tottenham’s squad, Pochettino is attaching paramount importance to this competition, saying a first trophy since 2008 would provide a lift for the whole club.

Jay McEveley handled the ball inside his own penalty area in the 74th minute to give Tottenham a penalty

He said: ‘This is the most important game because it is the chance to play in a final at Wembley.

‘It is important to have the opportunity to win a cup in March. I think that is very important and would be a very good thing for the club.

‘Now we realise the level of Sheffield United. We have seen other examples in the FA Cup too. We have to be strong in our minds and expect a tough game. It is going to be a difficult game in a good atmosphere and we have to be ready to fight.’

Citing Tottenham’s underwhelming performance in the first leg at White Hart Lane, Pochettino added: ‘We have to improve our game and play more quickly. We played in a very slow tempo. They played deep and we ended up playing the way they wanted us to play. Now we must play quicker and the way we want to play.’

Pochettino described the second leg as the most important game of the season 

Townsend stepped up to the spot and coolly converted to put Tottenham ahead with just over 15 minutes to play

Pochetino also insisted his side would be going out to win rather than protect their lead.

‘I think the pressure is the same as it was in the home game,’ he said. ‘We want to get to the final. But after the first leg we need to be careful, though we need to play freely. We need to score.

‘Our fans expect us to arrive in the final at Wembley. But we need to play better than Sheffield, show more energy than Sheffield and try to fight. For me we need to go there thinking it is 0-0. I believe we will need to score. We have to forget about the first leg and show the mentality to win.

‘When I speak about being more aggressive it is in the right way. We need to fight to get on the ball and instil our game.’ 

Nacer Chadli returned to training on Tuesday following a family bereavement, but Pochettino indicated he was ‘unlikely’ to be involved.
