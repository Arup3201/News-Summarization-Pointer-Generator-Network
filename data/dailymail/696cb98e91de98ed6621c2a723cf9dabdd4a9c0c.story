A patient group has defended its 'excellent' GP after he was suspended from practice because he failed to manage 'endless' reams of paperwork.

Dr Nihal Elapatha had his contract at his GP surgery terminated after a hearing found his performance was 'unacceptable'.

The 65-year-old had worked at the Rochester Healthy Living Centre for 13 years before he was suspended last March.

But a tribunal found his record keeping was 'inadequate' and that he did not arrange the appropriate treatment or tests for patients.

The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service also heard that Dr Elapatha was unable to touch-type and was not able to record everything that happened during an appointment.

Dr Nihal Elapatha had his contract at his GP surgery in Rochester, Kent, suspended for a year after a medical tribunal found his performance was 'unacceptable'. But patients have rallied in support of their 'excellent' GP, with more than 650 people signing a petition in his favour

The fitness to practise panel noted: 'He could not type onto the medical record everything that took place during a single 10-minute consultation.'

It adds: 'He had no touch typing ability and used his index fingers of both hands and one thumb on the space bar to make medical notes.'

Dr Elapatha's practice was described as 'high demand, high volume where one has to work as though on a conveyor belt'.

The panel suspended him for a year despite hearing that none of his patients were harmed in any way due to medical negligence or malpractice.

However the hearing was also told all Dr Elapatha's patient satisfaction surveys were above the Medway and national average.

Since the hearing, more than 650 people have signed a petition supporting Dr Elapatha.

Patient Mandy Richardson-Mills, 42, said Dr Elapatha 'saved her life' and that he should not have been suspended because of 'endless admin'.

She said: 'The whole situation is just disgusting and they were just trying to find a way to get rid of him.

The fitness to practise panel heard Dr Elapatha, who is 60 years old, could not touch type and struggled to take down all the relevant notes during a 10-minute consultation (file picture posed by models)

'He literally saved my life and saved my ex-partner's life too. He was always there to support me and still is.

'He has got a whole lot of support. He is a good doctor and that should be the priority over endless admin.

'He was always there to treat his patients and he did a wonderful job. I can't praise him highly enough.

'There is a ridiculous amount of pressure on GPs. He is in his 60s and can't type, bless him. That doesn't make him a bad doctor.'

Since Dr Elapatha left the surgery last March, services for around 2,000 patients at the surgery in Rochester, Kent, have been covered by locums.

He has since taken remedial action by investing in new software, technical training and learning how to touch type.

The panel, which concluded on January 30, found that  a permanent ban would not be appropriate.

Chairman Linda Buchanan said: 'The panel found that Dr Elapatha had limited insight into his failings.

'It notes that initially, Dr Elapatha did appear to acknowledge that his record-keeping was inadequate and this was noted in the panel's determination on impairment.

'However, he appears to minimise his failings and therefore there is little reassurance that he will not act similarly in the future.

'The panel has determined that, given the serious nature of the findings and potential risk to patient safety, it is necessary for the protection of members of the public for Dr Elapatha's registration to be suspended immediately.'
