Mick Jagger took a swipe at President Obama's NSA surveillance controversy during a Rolling Stones concert in the US capital Washington DC.

'I don't think President Obama is here tonight... But I'm sure he's listening in,' Jagger said.

Fans at the concert on Monday night had initially booed when they heard the President's name but cheered at Jagger's joke.

Can't get no extradition: The Rolling Stones on stage in Washington where frontman Mick Jagger mocked President Obama over the recent NSA spying scandal

The front man was referring to the recent
wiretapping scandal, in which former NSA worker Edward Snowden, blew 
the whistle on the government's ability to spy on citizens' emails and 
phone calls.

Obama has staunchly defended sweeping secret surveillance into America's phone records and foreigners' Internet use, declaring 'we have to make choices as a society.'

The President famously joined the Rolling Stones on stage in 2012 when the legendary band performed as part of the White House concert series.

Snowden is currently being held in a 
transit area at Moscow's Sheremetevo Airport, from where he is 
reportedly seeking to fly to Ecuador to claim asylum.

Today it emerged that the president of Venezuela has said he would consider an asylm request by the former CIA worker.

Nicolas Maduro said: 'If they proposed it, and it seems that it has been requested of Ecuador â€¦ we would also consider it.'

Today WikiLeaks suggested he could be forced to remain in Russia permanently because Washington's 'bullying' is making it impossible for him to move countries without arrest.

However Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated he is a 'free man' and that the sooner he leaves 'the better it will be for us, and him'.

The US government has issued a warrant
for Snowden's arrest on charges of leaking details of a America's 
National Security Agency web and telephone surveillance programme and 
called on any country he visits to arrest and deport him.
