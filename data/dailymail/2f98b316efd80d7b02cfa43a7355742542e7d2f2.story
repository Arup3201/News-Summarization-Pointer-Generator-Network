A second man has appeared in court accused of killing his great-uncle outside a gipsy family wedding.

William McGinley, 26, is charged the murder of Bernard McGinley close to a church in rural County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, last month moments before the traveller wedding was due to start.

Last month's ceremony for the marriage of Matilda McGinley, 17, and Jimmy O'Connor, 16, was delayed for a short period after the shooting but still went ahead.

The accused's father, Patrick McGinley, 46, has already appeared in court charged with the murder of the 63-year-old grandfather from County Longford in the Irish Republic who was shot in the chest in front of his wife, Brigid.

William McGinley, who has been remanded in custody, is also charged with the attempted murder of the dead man's son.

Victim: Barney McGinley, 63, was shot dead outside a church in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland

Bernard McGinley Jnr was injured in the same incident which took place  outside St Mary's Catholic Church in the village of Newtownbutler- just before the bride was due to walk down the isle.  

The defendant, who is a cousin of the bride, appeared at Omagh Magistrates' Court wearing a grey fleece over a white T-shirt.

William McGinley, who, like his father, is from Lisfarrell, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood the charges he faces during the short hearing. 

McGinley's lawyer, Seamus Leonard, said his client denied involvement.

'This man has consistently denied any criminality,' he said, stressing that he had provided police with a 'full account' of what happened.

Mr Leonard said it was not alleged that William McGinley fired the shot that killed Bernard McGinley.

'But it is alleged he fired the shot which attempted to murder Bernard McGinley Jnr,' he added. 

McGinley was remanded in custody to appear in court in Enniskillen, via video-link, alongside his father on March 16. 

Father Michael King said the wedding party had asked him for the service to take place as planned.

He explained: 'They said 'father, we would like you to proceed with the wedding', so I proceeded with the wedding. They spent at least half an hour inside the church at the end taking photographs.'

The victim was flown to hospital from Lisnaskea in a police helicopter but died later.

Tributes were later paid to him. Cousin Willie McGinley said on Facebook: 'R.I.P. Uncle Barney. Gone but will never be forgotten. Still can't believe he's gone. God only takes the best.' 

And Michaela Dinnegan added: 'R.I.P Barney. May you get the best bed in heaven and look over all your family and help them get through this hard time.'
