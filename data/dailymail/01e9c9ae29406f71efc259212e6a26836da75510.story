David Beckham honed his world famous football skills by practising with Care Bears, as he wasn't allowed to have a ball in the house, he has revealed.

The former England captain admitted he used to kick the stuffed toys around his sister's bedroomÂ  after grueling sessions in the park with his father and after-school matches.

Beckham, who retired from football in May, talks of his childhood training routines in a self-titled book which will be released on October 31.

In the same extract the former England captain recalls the moment he secured the country's place in the 2002 World Cup with a free-kick against Greece

'I would carry on playing when I got 
home. I wasn't allowed a football in the house so I would practise by 
kicking the Care Bears in my sister's bedroom,' an extract published by The Times reveals.

'My
mum thought it was funny, but it showed how much I loved football. I 
couldn't get enough of it,' writes Beckham, who said he would have 
'jumped at the chance' to skip school and train all day.

The 38-year-old claims his strict training rituals were the root of his confidence and 
ability as a player later in life,

The long sessions paid off in 2001 during a qualifying match against Greece, in which the star secured the country's place in the 2002 World Cup with a free-kick in the 93rd minute.

Describing the moment, Beckham, who 
had been reprimanded by fans since his infamous red-card while playing 
Argentina at the 1998 tournament, suggests it was this victory that 
restored English football fans' affection for him.

'I was forgiven at last', he writes, recalling the roar of the stadium as the ball hit the net.

But Beckham, who made his England debut in 1996, says his success had more to do with hard work than good fortune.

Referencing
another sporting legend, Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson, he states: 
'If you have done everything possible to prepare for your event, 
confidence will stick'.

In a previous extract from the illustrated book, David Beckham, the star recalls how his father's love of Manchester United sparked his interest in the club for which he would play 394 matches.

His 10-year stint at the club came to an end with his transfer to Real Madrid in 2003.

After going on to play for AC Milan, LA Galaxy and lastly Paris Saint-Germain the star officially retired from the game in May 2013.

He famously donated his large salary from the Parisian club to charity.

The publication of the book comes just weeks after the former footballer was accused of being 'obsessed with celebrity status' by his former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.

In his new book, My Autobiography, Ferguson claims the footballer 'lost focus' in his pursuit of a celebrity lifestyle.
