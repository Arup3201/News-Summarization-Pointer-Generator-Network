A group of thrill-seekers were left suspended 150 feet from the ground for more than two hours when a roller coaster malfunctioned, causing it to stop unexpectedly.

A dozen people became trapped in a vertical position on the Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit at Universal Studios, Florida, when a computer glitch sent the ride into 'safety mode' bringing their cart to a halt.

The 12-person train stopped near the top of the first hill of track coaster at around 7pm yesterday.

Closed for repair: Universal spokesperson Tom Schroder said the ride would remain closed until an investigation has taken place

According to Universal, it took more than two hours to free the passengers, who were brought back to the ground at around 9.30pm.

One woman was hospitalised after complaining of neck injuries.

Universal spokesman Tom Schroder said rescuers took their time to comfort the stranded riders before making sure they were brought down as safely as possible.

He said: 'The safety system did exactly what it's supposed to do.

'We spent a lot of that time talking to them (the passengers) and trying to make them as comfortable as we could.'

Several other trains were on the track when the ride stopped, but park workers were able to help those passengers off almost immediately.

Down to earth: The unlucky thrill-seekers were left suspended for more than two hours before emergency crews could bring them back to ground

However, the final train was stuck more than 150 feet from the ground and was positioned vertically.

Orlando Fire Rescue crews moved the cart forward to a horizontal position before the passengers were allowed to get off the train and take an elevator down.

No serious injuries were reported, but Schroder said one woman complained of neck pain and went to the hospital as a precaution.

Good service: The Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, which was officially opened in 2009, has a top speed of 65mph

Park officials will now investigate what caused the glitch, Schroder said. It wasn't immediately clear when the ride would be running again.

He said: 'We're not going to reopen it until we understand what happened and make sure it can't happen again.'

The ride was previously closed for two days in August when the coaster came to a sudden stop, which caused one woman to sustain a minor injury.
