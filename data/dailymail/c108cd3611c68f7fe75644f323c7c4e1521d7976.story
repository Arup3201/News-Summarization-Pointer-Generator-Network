The building, believed to date from before the Second World War, has been renovated and extended to include an octagonal-shaped reception room with roof light, kitchen, bathroom and utility room.

But there is no off-street parking or garage and the energy rating is E, the second-lowest rating. 

Norham Road, close to the Oxford University Parks, is one of the city's most expensive streets. 

House prices are rising rapidly in the city, with the cost of renting overtaking some areas of London, according to a report published this week.

National Housing Federation research lists Oxford as the second most unaffordable place in the country to rent, second only to south Buckinghamshire, which includes the exclusive areas of Gerrards Cross and Chalfont St Giles.

The federation found the cost of renting from a private landlord in Oxford has risen to £1,113 per month, or £13,356 a year, which swallows up half of an Oxford resident's average £26,536 annual earnings. 

Estate agent James Cridland said: 'At £1,000 per square foot, it's an extraordinary amount of money and close to, if not matching, London prices.

'The eventual owner will probably want to spend quite a lot on it to finish it to their taste, although you could move into it tomorrow.'
