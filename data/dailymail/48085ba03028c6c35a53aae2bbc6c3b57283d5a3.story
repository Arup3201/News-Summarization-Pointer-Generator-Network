'Turfed out': Teresa Miller at her new home after being accused of anti-social behaviour for complaining about Susan Boyle's singing

Many people would pay good money for a private audience with a worldwide superstar.

For Susan Boyle’s next-door neighbours, however, hearing her sing every day became a nightmare – leading to almighty rows and police calls.

Teresa Miller, 40, claims Miss Boyle would play her own singles and perform karaoke at the top of her voice. Her favourites were said to include Wild Horses, I Dreamed A Dream and Donny Osmond’s This Is The Moment.

Miss Miller said she complained, but in return Miss Boyle and other neighbours accused her of anti-social behaviour – and Miss Miller and her disabled ten-year-old daughter Daniella were told to leave their rented house by their landlord in October.

The singer then rented the property and plans to buy it so she can convert the two semis, both former council houses, into a detached six-bedroom home.

Miss Miller said the saga had left her in debt and depressed. ‘I’ve been through hell,’ she said.

‘Susan is a good singer but once she had a song out on CD she would listen to it over and over and start singing to it on a microphone. It would go on most days, one time until after 10pm.

‘Now I’ve been turfed out. I just don’t know why anyone would want to build a six-bedroom house in the middle of a council estate. Why take a house that a family could be in?’

Representatives of Miss Boyle, 52, deny that her singing has caused problems and said Miss Miller’s claims had been dismissed by other neighbours.

The entertainer, who lives with her cat in a former council house in Blackburn, West Lothian, has amassed an estimated £22million after selling more than 20million copies of her five studio albums.

Miss Miller, a single mother whose daughter has muscle problems, said she used to get on well with her neighbour and voted for her on Britain’s Got Talent in 2009. But while Miss Boyle would sing occasionally, her performances became ‘unbearable’ after finding fame.

‘She used to sing Wild Horses over and over again. It sounded like she was doing a karaoke,’ Miss Miller said. ‘Something played the backing music and she would do the singing. She always used a microphone.

'You could hear it all over the house. 
There was a Donny Osmond one that she sang for a few weeks. It would go 
on, then off for a couple of hours, then back on. Everybody likes a bit 
of music but there is a limit.’

Miss Miller complained to the council about two years ago.

In turn, Miss Boyle called police to report her neighbour for anti-social behaviour. Last August Miss Miller was served two months’ notice to move out by her landlords Romano and Claudia Pacitti.

The only rental in the area she could find at short notice needed furnishing and, in total, she claims to have had to lay out £2,000 on the move, much of which she had to borrow from family.

Miss Miller said: ‘I was devastated. We haven’t spoken to Susan since. She’s got the full building to herself now so she can blare it out all she wants.’

As well as denying that Miss Boyle’s singing had caused problems, her agent said she did not force her neighbours from their house and had started renting the property only after they had already been asked to leave.

A spokesman added: ‘Susan’s love of her home town has been well documented in the past. She continues to enjoy living there and enjoys good relationships with her neighbours.’

Miss Miller’s landlord Mrs Pacitti said: ‘We served Teresa with a notice to quit because there were three serious issues with that tenancy. It was a business decision and has absolutely nothing to do with Susan Boyle.

‘We had complaints of anti-social behaviour, not just from Susan, from other neighbours as well. Susan did not ask me to remove Teresa. I approached Susan. There was nothing underhand.’
