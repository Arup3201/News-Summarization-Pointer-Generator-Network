Australian Police said that they raided homes in the south-west of Sydney on Thursday but that the raids had nothing to do with Monday's siege at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place.    

A spokeswoman for the Australian Federal Police and New South Wales Police confirmed that the forces were 'conducting search warrants as part of an on-going operation'.

However, given that activity is still on-going 'to ensure the safety and security of the operation and the members involved' no further information would  be immediately provided, the police spokeswoman said.

'It is not in any way related to the Martin Place incident but we will give out more information as soon as we are in a position to do so,' the spokeswoman said.

The two police forces raided five homes in Sydney on Thursday as part of an ongoing investigation into terrorism, with one of the homes also a target of September's large-scale counter-terrorism raids - Operation Appleby -- according to the ABC.

The police haven't so far laid any charges related to the search warrants, a spokesman told the ABC. 

Both the New South Police and the Australian Federal Police forces were part of an operation to rescue hostages from the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, central Sydney.

The 17-hour ordeal for the hostages ended in a hail of bullets. Two of the hostages died along with the gunman.
