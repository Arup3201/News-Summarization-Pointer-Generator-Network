The first ever transgender beauty contest has been staged in Turkey, with photos of the landmark event shining a light into the vibrant world of colourful outfits, masses of hairspray - and a whole heap of bravery.

Simply holding the contest was a bold 
move given that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LBGT) people in 
the country face continual legal challenges and discrimination, despite 
the fact homosexuality is legal.

The pageant formed part of a week-long celebration of LGBT events held 
against a background of violence towards transgender sex workers.

Advocacy group LGBT Turkey say 70 transgender people have been killed in the country since 2002.

According to a 2011 report by Amnesty International, hate crimes in Turkey towards gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people - including violent attacks and murders - are common but largely ignored by the authorities.

But competitors in the pageant were determined to take a stand - and make the most out of the day.

Taking part in the contest was an act of bravery as transgender people are often persecuted in Turkey

Photographer Sedat Suna was there to 
capture the friendly yet competitive atmosphere behind the scenes as 
well as the on-stage performances.

rivals with hair styling, make-up and arranging the costumes to ensure 
everyone looked their best.

Watched
 by a crowd of around 500, a jury of eight transgender people were 
responsible for awarding points to the 13 competitors who appeared first
 in bikinis and later in a full dress show and Yanki Bayramoglu finally took the crown.
