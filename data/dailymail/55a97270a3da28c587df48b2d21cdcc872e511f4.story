Britain's most unloved dog who was nicknamed 'Boomerang' after he was returned to a rescue centre three times by potential new owners has finally found a home.

Six-year-old Flynn had lived at the shelter since he was found wandering the streets in April 2010.

It took just two months for the brown Staffordshire bull terrier cross to find his first home in June that year.

Six-year-old Flynn was nicknamed Boomerang by the staff at Worcestershire Animal Rescue Centre in Malvern because potential owners kept returning him

But, barely a week later, he was returned after his new owners decided that they did not have time to look after a dog.

Flynn left the home again in 2011 but was returned when his second set of owners separated and last year he was brought back after a third owner developed terminal cancer.

This led to desperate staff nicknaming Flynn 'Boomerang' because he always came back to the Worcestershire Animal Rescue Centre in Malvern.

Lovable: Flynn is always smiling and wagging his tail. He is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy

Finally last Thursday a new family arrived at the centre and took Flynn home.

Speaking yesterday Jackie Turner, the animal welfare coordinator at the shelter, said: 'Flynn is such a lovely, loving dog.

'It was really sad that we weren't able to find a forever home to settle in through no fault of his own.

'We wanted to find him a family to live with because he is such a loving dog.

'When people come to look at the dogs he sat in the window with his ears flapping away.

'We are all wondering why he hasn't gone because he is so adorable and such a loving boy - he doesn't bark and jump up.

'All the staff fell in love with Flynn, he is always smiling and wagging his tail so I can't understand why he hasn't found a home.

'He's just so affectionate, he craves fuss and cuddles and will be a lovely edition to the new family.

'He was so excited when he went home with them, you could see he looked so happy and the family seemed lovely.

'They had seen his picture on our website and said they just fell in love straight away.

'Fingers crossed now we won't see him back here again.

'He loves to play with a ball and can often be found with a tennis ball in his mouth.

'He is really good around children and as long as he has a comfy bed and a football he will be very happy.'
