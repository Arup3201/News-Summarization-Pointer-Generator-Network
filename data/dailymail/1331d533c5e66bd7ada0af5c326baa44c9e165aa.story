Whether it’s a pair of wooden shoes from Amsterdam, a beach blanket from Rio de Janeiro or a silk scarf from Cambodia, holidaymakers are filling their luggage – and their homes – with souvenirs from their travels around the world.

It turns out that the tradition of collecting travel keepsakes dates as far back as 980BC, providing the groundwork for a global industry that is now worth billions of pounds.

Amber beads from Scandinavia were discovered in Ireland and are believed to be the very first souvenir, according to a Holiday Inn infographic that explores the history of travel keepsakes. 

 

While today’s travellers collect ‘I Love New York’ T-shirts or tiny replicas of Paris' Eiffel Tower, the first mass produced souvenirs were pilgrim badges from shrines across Europe in 1400AD.

Spoon collecting swept through the US in the mid-1800s just before the souvenir boom from 1870 to 1960 as travelling became more affordable and the industry for inexpensive mementos flourished.

Popular keepsakes from England included objects painted with images of seaside towns.

Today, Britons are among the biggest collectors of souvenirs, spending an estimated £1.2 billion annually.
