It promises to be some wedding.

Carolyn Bourne, 60, launched the first salvo by sending her future daughter-in-law an email criticising her ‘staggering uncouthness and lack of grace’.

Yesterday the father of bride-to-be Heidi Withers hit back, branding Mrs Bourne a ‘snotty Miss Fancy Pants’.

In the stinging repost, Alan Withers, 
64, said the renowned horticulturist ‘has her head stuck so far up her 
own a*** she doesn’t know whether to speak or f**t.’

And although Mrs Bourne appears fastidious about social mores, it emerged yesterday that she may have become pregnant some months before her first marriage in 1974, according to public records.

She is also now on her third marriage.

The astonishing war of words began after
 Miss Withers, 28, and her fiancé Freddie Bourne, 29, spent the weekend 
at the home of his father Edward and stepmother Carolyn in April.

Incensed by her future daughter-in-law’s
 apparent lack of manners, Mrs Bourne sent her an email listing all her 
faults. She then sent it twice more to ensure it arrived.

In the attack she told Miss Withers she should attend a finishing school in ‘utmost haste’ to get rid of her ‘bad manners’.

She went on to describe her as ‘an ideal candidate for the Ladette to Lady television series’.

Happy couple: Heidi Withers and her fiancé Freddie Bourne are reeling after the venomous message sent by Mrs Bourne bemoaning Heidi's manners

Stunned Miss Withers, a PA for a London recruitment firm, sent it on to a select group of friends.

However, the email was forwarded to others and has now been read by millions on the internet.

Speaking from the £450,000 family home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, Mr Withers, 64, said he would never forgive Mrs Bourne for sending the email.

‘Heidi was very upset and the two of them obviously don’t see eye to eye,’ he added.

‘I met Carolyn and her husband Edward for dinner at a pub in London last year.

‘Edward was a jovial chap but Carolyn was quite snotty. She had a look about her which made us think she thought she was better than us. She kept talking about her five horses and how it made her part of the Queen’s set.

‘Ever since that meeting we call her 
Miss Fancy Pants. I don’t care if she apologises. You can’t take back 
what has been said once it’s said.’

In the email, Mrs Bourne accused Miss
 Withers of poor table manners, insulting the family in public and 
failing to send a handwritten card to say thank you after her stay.

She even said her behaviour had left their pet dog Bomber  ‘profoundly upset, depressed and anxious’.

Freddie
 Bourne is getting married to Miss Withers in an £18,000 ceremony in the
 great hall of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire in October.

Mrs Bourne
 told Miss Withers that her decision to get married in a castle smacks 
of ‘brash, celebrity style behaviour’.

She went on to criticise Miss Withers’ parents for failing to ‘contribute very much’ money towards the wedding.

Mr Withers said: ‘The reason we have been unable to contribute as much money was because we both lost our jobs. I doubt Carolyn was aware of that when she sent the email. We were unceremoniously got rid of without warning in January and have been searching for jobs ever since.’

His wife Sylvia, 60, has since found work as a matron in a care home but he is still looking for work.

‘I have no desire to meet Carolyn or Edward again before or after the wedding,’ Mr Withers added.

‘They don’t know us and we don’t know them. Of course at the wedding we will shake hands and toast Heidi and Freddie.’

The young couple met three years ago through mutual friends and soon became close, enjoying a trip to America in 2009.

They live in a flat with a shihtzu dog called Whisky in the affluent district of Parsons Green in South-west London.

Freddie has an office nearby where he runs an online bike shop.

A source close to the couple said: ‘It’s not going to be a Jordan wedding with all that kind of pumpkin carriages and tack.

They are middle-class people with middle-class respectabilities.

‘It’s not like they’re taking over the entire castle in some vulgar show of excess. There’s a great hall that’s available and that’s where they’re having it.

‘They wanted to have as much of a 
dream wedding as possible. They heard about Berkeley Castle and it was 
available to book, so why not? It’s such a lovely setting.’

The
 source added: ‘Freddie is an absolutely charming guy and Heidi is an 
absolute sweetie. I’ve never heard a bad word said about either of them.
 None of their friends can believe what’s been said about Heidi.

‘Rude
 and unpleasant are the last things you’d say about her. The view of 
people who know them is that the problem lies with the mother in law.’

Mrs Bourne, 60, sent the e-mail to after she was less than impressed with her etiquette when she visited her Devon home in April

The couple declined to comment on the row yesterday.

Mrs Bourne and her husband Edward confirmed they were ‘well aware’ of the criticism by Heidi’s father but still planned to go to the wedding.

When asked if she thought it may be awkward, Mrs Bourne laughed: ‘We will see.’

It is high time someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their absence and I feel sorry for you.

Unfortunately
 for Freddie, he has fallen in love with you and Freddie being Freddie, I
 gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to 
consider how he might be able to help you. It may just be possible to 
get through to you though. I do hope so.

If
 you want to be accepted by the wider Bourne family I suggest you take 
some guidance from experts with utmost haste. There are plenty of 
finishing schools around.

Please,
 for your own good, for Freddie’s sake and for your future involvement 
with the Bourne family, do something as soon as possible.

Here are a few examples of your lack of manners:

I
 understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the 
cost of your wedding. (There is nothing wrong with that except that 
convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the
 years for their daughters’ marriages.)

If
 this is the case, it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your 
sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes.
