Microsoft’s Xbox One launched to a worldwide fanfare on Friday and was said to be outselling the previous 360 console two-to-one, yet not everyone is happy.

A number of users complained over the weekend that their new consoles were making strange noises and wouldn’t recognise or play discs.

To make amends, Microsoft has said it will exchange all faulty consoles and, as an extra sweetener, will give all those affected a free download code for a game of their choice, from a set list.

Microsoft has said it will exchange any consoles that have been fitted with a faulty optical drive and will give all those affected a free download code for a new game. Games being offered include Dead Rising 3, Forza Motorosport 5, pictured, Ryse: Son of Rome and Zoo Tycoon

Microsoft also outraged a number of users after they discovered that certain apps couldn't be used without a Gold membership.

Apps that are free to download, including Skype and Netflix,
can only be used if a customer pays either £39.99 a year, or £5 a month 
to become a Gold member.

In the case of Netflix, Lovefilm and Wuaki.tv, users additionally have to pay the individual subscription fees for each service on top of their Gold membership price.

Free games being offered include Dead Rising 3, Forza Motorosport 5, Ryse: Son of Rome and Zoo Tycoon.

The error message reports began almost as soon as fans got their hands on the new device, which many had been waiting eight years to be released.

It occurred with a fault in the optical drive in some consoles meaning that discs couldn't be read properly.

According to Microsoft, only a ‘small number’ of what it calls ‘early adopters’ were affected.

However, this could still be hundreds if not thousands of customers given the fact Microsoft reported sales of more than one million consoles in the first 24 hours. The console has also sold out at many retailers. 

Any customer who experiences this error is entitled to a free replacement console available through Microsoft’s support pages.

The free game offer was discovered by website Polygon after an Xbox One customer forwarded them an email they’d received from Microsoft Customer Care.

A Microsoft spokesman told 
MailOnline: 'We’re working directly with those affected to get a 
replacement console to them as soon as possible through our advance 
exchange program. Rest assured, we are taking care of our customers.

'While a replacement console is on 
its way, we want to ensure our advance exchange customers can stay in 
the game.

'We will provide each of them with a free digital download of 
one of the launch titles published by Microsoft Studios.'
