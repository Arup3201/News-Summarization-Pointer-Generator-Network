Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal have a better chance of making the Champions league quarter-finals than Chelsea or Manchester City.

The Gunners may have feared the worst after finishing second in their group, but were ultimately handed a relatively easy tie against Monaco. But Chelsea and Manchester City weren't so lucky, they were drawn against Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona respectively.

While Carragher admitted Monaco had a decent squad, he was comfortable the north London side would emerge triumphant.

Arsenal have been drawn Monaco in the Champions league, it was the draw Arsene Wenger had wanted 

Jamie Carragher said on Monday Night Football that Arsenal had the best chance of going through

Speaking on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football, he said: 'They've been fortunate this time. They normally get a giant and they normally go out.

'But Arsene Wenger and the players will be delighted with that.

'Monaco spent a lot of money in the last couple of years and have some good players but it's a tie you'd expect Arsenal to come through.

'If Manchester City and Chelsea come through their ties you'd expect them to go further than Arsenal but now you'd say Arsenal have more chance of being in the quarter-finals than those two.'
