Lassana Diarra is back training with West Ham in the hope of earning a short-term contract.

Diarra, 29, has been working with head of medicine Stijn Vandenbroucke, whom he previously worked with at Anzhi Makhachkala.

Manager Sam Allardyce invited Diarra to train with the club prior to Christmas as QPR made attempts to sign him. He also held talks with Inter Milan.

'He is training with us,' Allardyce said.

'I'm not so sure whether we have finalised a deal yet but he is doing a little bit of training with us. The deal is very close to being finalised and on the basis of where we are with our squad and the injuries, once we have him fit he will be a very good addition based on his previous record as a footballer.'

Diarra's spell with Lokomotiv Moscow ended acrimoniously after reports he refused to train following a bust-up with manager Leonid Kuckuk but, despite not playing in almost nine months, Allardyce believes the ex-Chelsea, Arsenal and Portsmouth man could soon be part of his first-team squad at Upton Park.

'He won't be in any good shape in terms of being on the bench on Wednesday or on the bench on Saturday against West Brom,' added Allardyce.

'But I certainly hope that, with a good few days training with the lads, he will be close in seven to 10 days if he finally signs the contract.'

If the move comes off, it could be seen as something of a coup for the Hammers as Diarra brings experience and has also tasted trophy success, winning the FA Cup with both Chelsea and Portsmouth and the Spanish title at Real Madrid.
