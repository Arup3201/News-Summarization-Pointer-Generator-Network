This Christmas pudding weighs as much as an adult, contains more than 200,000 calories, measures two-feet wide and could feed a family of four for a month.

The recipe includes four loaves of bread, 40 eggs, 6kgs each of sultanas, raisins, currants and soft brown sugar, 2kgs of mixed peel, 20 lemons, 40 apples and 2kgs of chopped nuts.

But it's all for a good cause as portions of the giant cake are being sold off to raise money for charities.

The monster Christmas pudding contains 200,000 calories, measures two-feet wide and weighs eight stone

Head chef Jon Fell of Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, Lake District is the mastermind behind the gigantic creation. The festive favourite took more than 24 hours to cook and contains 40 eggs and four loaves of bread

Head chef Jon Fell of Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, Lake District, is the mastermind behind the heavy Christmas pudding. 

The festive favourite took more than 24 hours to cook and was so big that that the kitchen team had to have fire extinguishers on hand when they lit it.

The sweet treat is approximately 450 times bigger than a regular-sized portion and a family of four, consuming 8,000 calories between them in day, could survive off this treat for a month.

The 42-year-old said: 'A Single portion Christmas pudding  is about 100 grams and has about 450 calories. This Christmas pudding weighs 45kg and has about 202,000 calories to it.

'It is the ultimate Christmas pudding but probably a heart attack waiting to happen!

The sweet treat is approximately 450 times bigger than a regular-sized portion. Two 70cl bottle of brandy - one for setting alight- and two bottles of rum were added to give the pudding its distinctive taste

 'It is ridiculously calorific. If you think about it it's all fat and sugar.' 

To give the pudding its distinctive taste, Mr Fell added two 70cl bottle of brandy - one for setting alight - and two bottles of rum.

He said: 'We normally put about a teaspoon of the rum and brandy in a single sized portion. If we had had more time we would have kept it in the fridge for two or three weeks, leaving it to mature and we would have kept adding the brandy and rum.'

He added: 'It is certainly one the largest Christmas puddings I have ever seen - and probably one of the most alcoholic you could have this Christmas. It is big but it will also taste great.' 

A regular Christmas pudding takes around an hour to steam; this 45kg pudding took 24 hours of steaming 

4 loaves of bread 

40 eggs, 

6kg sultanas,

6kg raisins

6kg currants

6kg soft brown sugar

2kg mixed peel, 

20 lemons

40 apples

2kg chopped nuts

2 bottles of rum

2 bottles of brandy 

The pudding was so heavy that the chef had to enlist three helpers to carry it from machine to machine at the hotel in Calderbridge.

He said: 'It was difficult finding the right equipment to cook something so big and so heavy. The mixing of it was done by hand in two 40 litre containers because we couldn't fit the mixture anywhere else.'

Mr Fell combined all the ingredients, mixing them by hand, in two separate batches before steaming it in their steamer.

He said: 'We had an oven and steamer big enough but we had to use a big stock pot for it to stand in.'

A regular Christmas pudding takes around an hour to steam - this 45kg pudding took 24 hours of steaming.

Jon said: 'It was a bit of a guessing game but we knew just by working out everything that had been put into it that it was going to need that long.'

Once the pudding was cooked Mr Fell, with the help of his three sous chefs, took the heavy treat to the hotel's restaurant where they poured a litre bottle of brandy on it before setting it alight with a blow torch.

Jon said: 'We had to be careful because of health and safety. With a pudding that big with that much alcohol in it something could possibly have gone wrong.'

All for a good cause: Portions of the Christmas pudding will be sold to raise funds for local charities 

However the experienced chef took no chances and had a fire extinguisher and fire blanket at the ready if his giant pudding got a just a little bit too flammable.

He added: 'I was a bit nervous when I started to light it but thankfully everything went to plan and the smoke alarms didn't even go off.'

No stranger to creating giant culinary masterpieces, Mr Fell attempted to beat the Guinness World Record earlier this year for the largest scotch egg - weighing in at 11kg.

This time around the chef is doing it to create a little festive cheer this Christmas.

He said: 'I think it is all just a bit of fun but we knew it was possible. It is about seeing if you can cook something that big but the main thing is what you do with it after. 

'It would have been easy for us to have thrown anything into but we wanted it to taste great and we cooked it really for some local charities.

'We are going to let the charities sell portions off for Christmas with the proceeds going back to them. 

'Christmas can be a really difficult time for some people so if we can raise a bit of cash for someone then it is all worth it - but let's hope no one gets too tipsy.'
