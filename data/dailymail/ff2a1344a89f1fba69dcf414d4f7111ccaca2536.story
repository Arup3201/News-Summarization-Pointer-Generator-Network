An elderly cancer victim has died after a police dog savaged her in her  own home.

Irene Collins, 73, had answered her door to officers searching the neighbourhood for an escaped suspected drug dealer.

Just as she showed officers into the back garden of her home, the dog pounced, leaving her screaming in terror and covered in blood.

Penrith Road in Middlesbrough where Irene Collins lived when she was attacked by the police dog

Mrs Collins, who was suffering from lung cancer, was taken to hospital but died over the weekend.

Neighbours claimed to have warned officers beforehand that she was in a frail condition.

One
 said: ‘She wasn’t bitten, she was mauled. A relative told me the dog 
had punctured and broken her arm, ripped her other arm, and then managed
 to bite off her calf muscle after it had been restrained.’

Another
 neighbour said: ‘It was horrible, everyone could hear her screaming 
right across the street. It was a shock to see her. She had blood across
 her face, and she was grey with shock.

‘The police dog handler had searched my house earlier and he was in tears. He looked devastated by what happened.’

Cleveland
 Police said Mrs Collins had suffered ‘bites about her body’. Officers 
said the dog had been ‘withdrawn from operational policing activities’, 
but it was not clear whether it had been destroyed.

The tragedy, which happened in Middlesbrough last Wednesday night, was said to have left the whole street in shock.

Mrs
 Collins, a widow for 30 years, had opened the door to officers chasing a
 suspected drugs dealer who had fled through gardens after being stopped
 in a car nearby.

A resident said: ‘The street was full of police. There was a helicopter searching from above and about seven police cars.

Assistant chief constable Sean White of Cleveland Police offered his condolences to the family

‘A
 car had apparently been stopped and the driver ran off into our estate.
 The police were knocking on doors and asking to search people’s back 
gardens and outbuildings. Someone told them Irene was ill but they went 
to her door anyway.’

Mrs 
Collins was said to have answered the door at the side of her house and 
was about to  show the officers into her back garden when the dog, 
described as a cross between a springer spaniel and an alsatian, 
attacked her. After being treated at the scene she was taken to James 
Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, where she died.

Speaking
 soon after the drama, neighbour Claire Williams said: ‘Irene was lying 
on the kitchen floor while the police attended to her.

‘She was in ill health already. She barely leaves the house, her breathing is very poor and she’s about six stone.

'I
 warned the police to be careful and told them she may not make it to 
the door but they went anyway. It’s horrific what happened to her.’

Mrs Collins’ family issued a brief statement thanking people for their ‘kind messages’.

A family spokesman added: 'We are devastated.'

Jose Pearson, 85, a neighbour for almost 60 years, described Mrs Collins as a lovely woman.

‘All the work she did was for charity,’ she said. ‘For years it was all she did, working in a charity shop.’

The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Neighbour Kerry Blades laid flowers at Ms Collins’ Penrith Road home with niece Tylier Smith, nine.

She said: 'It is disgusting. For her to be in her own home when it happened, it has shocked everyone down the road. The dog shouldn’t have been let off a lead until it was absolutely necessary.

'She has lived here for years. I have been here for 34 years, and I think she has been here since I was little.

'She was very quiet, but always very nice with people. She liked spending time with her family and her son was always there. We used to see her pottering around in her garden as well.

'Nobody can believe what happened.'

Jack Williams, 20, a student at Teesside University who lives next door to Ms Collins, said he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news.

He said: 'We all can’t believe it. We thought that she was going to come home soon. She was a lovely woman, the best neighbour you could have asked for.

'What has happened to her, and what she went through is just horrific.'
