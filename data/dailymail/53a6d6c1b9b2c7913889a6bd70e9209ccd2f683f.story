Expenses: MP Helen Grant is receiving £20,000 a year for a second home in London, despite living inside the capital's commuter belt in Reigate, Surrey

A Government Minister was at the centre of an expenses row last night for receiving £20,000 a year for a second home – despite living in the London commuter belt where MPs are banned from claiming allowances.

Equalities Minister Helen Grant lives in a £1.8 million family house in Reigate, Surrey, which Commons authorities say is too close to Westminster to qualify for the controversial second-home allowance.

But Mrs Grant is claiming the maximum amount to cover rent on a London flat because her Maidstone constituency, which is more than 40 miles from the family home, is outside the expenses ‘exclusion zone’.

The arrangement has raised eyebrows because the Surrey MP in whose constituency she lives – Tory Crispin Blunt – makes the same journey as Mrs Grant into the Commons, but is barred from claiming the second-home perk.

Last night Mrs Grant, who was recently reprimanded for altering an employee’s contract to cut his sick pay, said she was ‘fully entitled’ to make the claims.

However, the revelations, contained in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary due to be broadcast Monday night, risks tainting the new intake of MPs with the expenses controversy which erupted in 2009.

Mrs Grant, 50, who entered Parliament at the 2010 General Election by winning Ann Widdecombe’s old seat, was the first black woman selected to defend a Tory seat.

The lawyer, regarded as a fast-rising Conservative star, became a Minister in the September reshuffle when she took on the dual roles of Justice Minister and Women and Equalities Minister.

The Channel 4 investigation discovered that Mrs Grant, who draws more than £26,000 a year from the solicitors’ firm she established in addition to her £97,000 pay as MP and Minister, does not have her own home in her Kent constituency.

Plush: The home is worth £1.8million and is in the highly desirable market town of Reigate in Surrey

Instead, she travels the 19 miles from 
the house she shares with her husband and two children in Surrey – 
bought 11 years ago for just over £1million, and now worth £800,000 more
– and claims for a Thameside flat next to MI6’s headquarters.

She has charged taxpayers the maximum £1,666 a month since starting to rent the property in March.

Last night, a spokesman for the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs’ expenses, said Mrs Grant had acted within the rules on second homes.

He added that it was ‘up to MPs to exercise their judgment as to how they claim their expenses’.

A spokeswoman for Mrs Grant said: ‘Mrs Grant’s constituency has been deemed by IPSA to be a non-London constituency and she is therefore fully entitled to use her rental accommodation allowance either in London or in the constituency.’

Earlier this month her constituency assistant Tony Williams said he was disgusted after she altered his contract to cut his sick pay when he needed time off for a heart condition.

Mr Williams’s contract said he was allowed up to two weeks’ sick pay – instead of the 26 weeks he was entitled to receive.

Mrs Grant claimed the sick pay was docked to give taxpayers a ‘fairer deal’, but the Commons authorities said his contract should not have been altered.
