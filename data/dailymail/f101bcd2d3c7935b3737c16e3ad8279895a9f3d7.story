Adam Bojelian, 15, won international fame after writing poems through blinking, has died

A paralysed schoolboy who won international fame after he painstakingly composed poems letter by letter through blinking has died at the age of 15.

Adam Bojelian from Edinburgh was born with cerebral palsy and lost all ability to move his body at just ten months old, leaving blinking as his only form of communication.

His mother Zoe, 54, would watch as he used his eyelids to indicate the correct letter while she went through the alphabet, before publishing his compositions online.

Fans from all over the world were touched by the schoolboy's poetry and even celebrities, including Hollywood star Ewan McGregor, have championed his work.

One of his poems about Christmas was even turned into an iTunes hit by a professional composer in 2012 and he won a Brit Writers' Award and a Blue Peter Gold Badge for his poetry.

Mrs Bojelian, who announced Adam's death on social media this week, previously explained how she noticed his special way of communicating when he was a toddler.

She said: 'Adam was about one when he went to a playgroup for children with disabilities. They used to sing "If You're Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands".

'Adam couldn't clap his hands, but I noticed every time they said "clap your hands" he blinked.

'As time went on it became clearer he was blinking when we asked him questions, and as he got older he counted by blinking. Over time it became obvious that's what he was doing.'

Just a day before he died, Adam had been given an Inspirational Champion award by charity group Young Epilepsy for his work representing young people with the condition.

This rhyme is a puzzle, as you will see,

This rhyme tells what a good leader should be,

A good leader respects the young and the old,

A good leader observes and is prepared to be bold,

A good leader is brave and will try something new,

A good leader works hard and gives praise when its,

A good leader expects the best from all staff,

A good leader brings happiness and shares in a laugh,

A good leader supports patients and gives them the best,

A good leader teaches staff to be ahead of the rest,

A good leader explains if something goes a miss, 

A good leader rejoices in times of great bliss,

If you study this rhyme and look very close,

You'll discover the leader I admire most.

Since announcing his death tributes have poured in from NHS staff, politicians and charity workers who had come to know his story.   

Dr Umesh Prabhu said: 'Simply can't stop crying. Learnt so much and touched so many hearts. #respect #humanity #love.'

Louise Macdonald, chief executive of youth charity YoungScot, said: 'Everyone who met [Adam] was so inspired by his amazing poetry & spirit - a privilege to honour him. Shine bright #braveadam.'

Scottish Government minister Humza Yousaf wrote: 'Deeply saddened hear passing of [Adam] love to all family & friends. Today world is a little bleaker having lost a true inspiration.'

MSP Mark McDonald said: 'Such sad news, an inspirational young man who touched many directly & indirectly & will not be forgotten.'

Ex-MSP Hugh O'Donnell paid tribute and posted: 'God Bless young sir. RIP.' 

Over six years, he spent much of his time at the Sick Kids's Hospital in Edinburgh where Mrs Bojelian said staff had treated him with 'neglect and indifference'.

She wrote to former First Minister Alex Salmond to complain about the standard of care he was receiving and the attitude of staff members.

She said: 'We are constantly reminded of his physical impairment.

'Staff at Sick Kids seem to start with the presumption that parents of a child with severe physical impairment will not want their child resuscitated.'
