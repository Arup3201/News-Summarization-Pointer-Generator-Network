Midfielder Gabi has criticised the on-field behaviour of Neymar Jnr after Atletico Madrid were dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Barcelona on Wednesday night.

Neymar turned in an impressive performance at Vicente Calderon as Luis Enrique's side booked their place in the semi-final of the competition.

The Brazilian scored twice in an ill-tempered match as Atleti ended the game with just nine men after Gabi and Mario Suarez both saw red.

Gabi was dismissed at half-time after receiving a second booking and the 32-year-old was clearly riled by Neymar's antics throughout the first 45 minutes.

'He's got an odd way of playing, particularly when he's winning,' Gabi said after the match

'He's always making gestures on the field, especially when he's in front. Nobody likes to lose and these things irritate you.'

Gabi revealed that he was given his marching orders for protesting to the referee that Atletico should have been awarded a penalty directly before Barcelona broke up-field and scored, and the former Zaragoza man thought it was a harsh decision.

'I said: "It was a penalty and a red card." That was my disrespect, according to [the referee]. I'm sorry for my team,' the former Spain Under 21 international added.

'I think the referee has to have much more personality and more respect for the players.

'We are all wrong sometimes. To be just, acknowledge your mistakes.'

Barcelona have now beaten Diego Simeone's side three times in the last month after victories in the first leg and La Liga.
