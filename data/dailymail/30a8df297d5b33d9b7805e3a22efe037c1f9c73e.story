The construction of Stonehenge has been voted the historical event that most Britons would like to travel back in time to witness.

The evacuation of Dunkirk, and the defending of Hadrian’s Wall by the Romans came second and third in the poll conducted by English Heritage.

The organisation carried out the survey to celebrate the launch of six weeks of living history events across the country this summer, including medieval jousts, knights and princess training academies, and the chance to meet some of England’s most famous kings and queens.

Still a mystery: English Heritage's Jeremy Ashbee said people wanted to discover more about who built the historic stone circle - and why

A total of 2,272 people were quizzed about which iconic historical event they would like to have been present at.

The lifting into place of the enormous stones at Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago topped the poll with almost half of those surveyed (47 per cent) wishing they’d been there to see it.

The masterminding of the evacuation of British soldiers from the Dunkirk beaches during the Second World War was the next choice (34 per cent), while seeing Roman soldiers patrolling Hadrian’s Wall came third (26 per cent).

Going underground: In second place, people wanted to watch the planning of the Dunkirk evacuation during the Second World War from the Secret Wartime Tunnels underneath Dover Castle

Watching Victorian scientist Charles Darwin conduct his revolutionary experiments from his home in Kent (23 per cent) and the first Viking raid at Lindisfarne Priory (18 per cent) were also popular choices at fourth and fifth place respectively.

King Harold falling in combat at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 (17 per cent) and Henry V preparing his troops ahead of the battle of Agincourt in France (16 per cent) also made it into the top ten.

Added to this, 68 per cent of adults said they wished they knew more about history and 47 per cent said they planned to visit a historic place this summer.

came second in the poll, while watching Charles Darwin (right) 
conducting experiments at Down House came in fourth

Jeremy Ashbee, Head Properties Curator at English Heritage, said: ‘There are so many things we don’t know about Stonehenge and perhaps that’s why it topped our poll, with people wanting to discover more about who built the stone circle, and why.

‘It is great that there is such an appetite for history. While English Heritage can’t literally take people back in time, we can offer the next best thing - the chance to experience those places where history was made.

'Over the six week summer holiday English Heritage will host its biggest ever summer of historical events providing fun, entertaining and inspiring days out for families, culture fans and those keen to find out more about England’s stories.’

Devastating attack: In fifth place was the chance to watch the first Viking raid taking place at Lindisfarne Priory

English Heritage is encouraging visitors to re-enact history for themselves this summer, and to share their experiences through social media. Visitors can submit photos of themselves on Facebook and Twitter, using the hashtag #makinghistory.
