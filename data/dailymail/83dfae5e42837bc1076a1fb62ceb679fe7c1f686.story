Nick Clegg today claimed Tory childcare reforms which he has vetoed would have increased bills for parents.

As the bitter coalition row deepened over Lib Dem opposition to changes, the Deputy Prime Minister dismissed research suggesting that allowing nurseries to look after more children would cut costs.

Mr Clegg ramped up the row with the Tories, insisting he had never agreed to the ratio changes which were opposed by parents and industry groups.

U-turn: Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said he would now block any attempt to increase the number of infants a childminder can care for

However, his decision to veto the reforms have triggered accusations of ‘turning his back on working parents’.

It had been estimated that the move to allow nurseries and childminders to look after more children could have saved parents nearly a third on their childcare bills.

But Mr Clegg claimed there was no evidence for this, and some nurseries said the changes would lead to rising costs.

'What we said was we would consult people on this idea and then we would react to how people responded.

'What I said very explicitly within Government is that you can only decide on this when we’ve heard the responses from people who frankly know better than any politician what it’s like to look after four, five, six two-year-old toddlers.'

He told his LBC 97.3 weekly phone-in show: 'The response, not just from nurseries, but overwhelmingly from parent groups was they thought this was a bad idea.

'They thought it was a bad idea for a number of reasons but the one I focused on…was the claim initially made that it would somehow reduce the weekly childcare bill for families. I, like everyone desperately want to do whatever I can to bring childcare costs down.

'What came back was a really clear answer that there was no real evidence that this would reduce childcare costs.

'In
fact at one nursery after another that I visited, they said, ‘To be 
honest Mr Clegg’, they would say to me privately, "It might well drive 
costs up because we’re going to have to spend more money on more 
higher-qualified staff".'

However
Mr Clegg’s decision raises questions about where power lies in the 
Coalition and will infuriate many Tories, including the Education 
Secretary Michael Gove.

A senior Number 10 source last night said the final childcare package ‘has not yet been agreed’.

Asked about Mr Clegg’s actions, the source said: ‘It is not a good way to behave – it’s best to announce things when they have been agreed.’

A study by the Department for Education found the changes, which were due to be introduced in September, could have slashed the cost of childcare by up to 28 per cent.

The analysis suggested the move could save parents an average £1,329 a year per child if it was widely adopted by nurseries.

But the proposal faced a backlash from influential parenting website Mumsnet and some parents, nurseries and childminding organisations, which argued that care would suffer.

Relaxation: Under the proposals one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three, and one adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four

Ministers stressed that the new 
child-to-carer ratios would be voluntary, and cited extensive evidence 
from other countries suggesting the change would cut costs without 
damaging the quality of care.

Tory MP Chris Skidmore accused Mr Clegg of ignoring the plight of parents faced with crippling childcare bills.

Mr
Skidmore, a member of the Commons education committee, said: ‘This is a
huge U-turn from Mr Clegg and undermines his claim that he wants 
cheaper childcare.’

Mr Clegg last night dismissed the 
DfE’s analysis, saying there was ‘no real evidence that increasing 
ratios will reduce the cost of childcare for families’.

He
added: ‘I have concluded that, because it will not reduce costs for 
parents or increase the quality of childcare, the proposed ratio changes
for pre-school children cannot proceed.’

Yesterday he telephoned leaders in the childcare sector and told them the plans were ‘dead in the water’.

Mr Clegg’s decision to wield the veto – and David Cameron’s apparent inability to stop him – is a major setback to Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss, who had championed the reforms.

One Government source said she had been ‘hung out to dry’.

The move is also a blow to Michael Gove, who said last month that the case for change was ‘formidable’.

From September, one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three.

One adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four.

Mr Clegg signed off on the plans in January, but got cold feet last month after private talks with figures at Mumsnet.

Downing Street last night stressed the childcare package had not been finalised.
