Australia could face some of its hottest temperatures in more than 17 years in the next few days as a number of remote areas brace themselves for the mercury to hit 50 degrees.

Two West Australian towns broke their records for the hottest January day on Wednesday, with Bulga Downs recording a temperature of 48 degrees and Carnarvon 47.9 degrees, but Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson Neil Bennett said the worst was yet to come.

'Chances are that some areas in Pilbara will see temperatures of around 49 and possibly hitting 50,' Mr Bennett told Daily Mail Australia.

An ongoing heatwave in West Australia could see temperatures reach 50 degrees in some remote areas 

There has only been three occasions when Australia saw days of 50 degrees or hotter, the most recent being in WA in 1998 and the other two occasions dating back to January and February in 1960 at Oodnadatta Airport in South Australia

'It only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm and then you won't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out,' Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson Neil Bennett said 

'A lot of temperature records could be broken on Friday; that's the day when the peak of the heat could occur and there's a possibility these places could hit 50 degrees.'

Mr Bennet explained that the extreme, dangerous temperatures were being caused by a huge un-moving hot air mass located above the state.

'There's a large pool of hot air sitting over the Pilbara region moving ever so slowly. It's just going around and around in an anticlockwise direction instead of heading north, east, south or west,' he said.

'We do get these occurring occasionally, but this time what we're seeing is temperatures getting to record levels in some areas. Marble Bar is one of them and Newman is another that could be at risk.'

'Perth has also now had 55 consecutive days of no rainfall, that's not a record (the longest is 83 days), but it is a long dry spell.'

Marble Bar was forecast to reach 48 degrees on Thursday, but if temperatures soar higher as the week progresses, the town could beat the state's all time temperature record of 50.5 degrees that was recorded in Mardie on February 1998.

There has only been three occasions when Australia saw days of 50 degrees or hotter, the most recent being the aforementioned date in WA, and the other two dating back to January and February in 1960 at Oodnadatta Airport in South Australia.

'So if we're predicting 50 degrees or more for certain areas, that's a pretty significant deal,' Mr Bennett said.

Owner of the Iron Clad Hotel at Marble Bar, Thomas Fox, told Daily Mail Australia that the locals were entirely unconcerned about the ongoing heat.

'It's pretty normal, it always gets hot out here,' Mr Fox told Daily Mail Australia when asked if he was worried about the possibility of a 50 degree day.

 'When it goes from 47 degrees down to 45 down here, it feels like the sea breeze is coming in!' Mr Fox said

Marble Bar, which has a population of under 200 according to the 2006 Census, is known as 'Australia's hottest town'

'The world just kicks along, you just don't plan to dig holes.

'There's a lot of difference between 45 and 47 [degrees] – anything above 46 and you can see that things become a lot more critical.

'At 45 you can walk around. If you have to go for a long walk you can with a water bottle, but if it hits 47 you think 's***' and just pack up.

'When it goes from 47 down to 45 down here, it feels like the sea breeze is coming in!'

A spokesman from Marble Bar's Nursing Post repeated the sentiment, telling Daily Mail Australia: 'I don't get any extra work because of that'.

'They [the locals] are used to 45 [degrees], so 48 or 49 is not that different. It's just something new to talk about but it's no big deal.'

The heat wave in WA is being caused by a slow-moving, large pool of hot air sitting over the Pilbara region

Mr Bennett said that while high temperatures were anticipated to continue in the region for the next few days, they could still just miss the 50 degree mark.

'It only needs just a slight change of wind speed for a short period around 2pm when we get maximum temperatures and then you won't get the temperatures you thought and they will be a degree or half a degree out,' he said.

'But we do expect it to remain in the high 40s.'

'We are expecting this hot air mass will move into central parts of the Northern Territory over the next two to three days and it could move its way into western Queensland at the end of the week, but there's no guarantees they would see these sorts of temperatures.'
