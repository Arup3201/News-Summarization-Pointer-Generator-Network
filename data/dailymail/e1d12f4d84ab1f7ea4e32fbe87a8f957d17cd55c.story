The Royal Marine who murdered a Taliban fighter should not be shown any clemency for his 'heinous crime', the head of the Armed Forces has said.

The 39-year-old commando – known only
 as Marine A – carried out the ‘field execution’ when he and two others 
found the injured man and he then shot him in the chest.

General Sir Nick Houghton believes that the gravity of the crime means he must be severely punished.

'Murder is murder, 
this is a heinous crime. No serviceman or woman is above the law', he said.

Challenge: Blackman and four other Marines investigated over the killing said their names should not be public

Marine A killed 
the insurgent near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 
servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade were killed and the Taliban hung the 
limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’.

Senior figure: Head of the Armed Forces General Houghton said not severely punishing murders would 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies'

Not punishing him would severely 'erode the moral ascendancy over our enemies', General Houghton said.

‘It would be quite wrong for the armed forces to adopt some special pleading, some sort of exemption,' he said.

‘If
 we try to put ourselves beyond the law or expect special provision from
 the law, then we start to erode the position where we have a moral 
ascendancy over those who are our enemies. Those in authority over the armed forces should not request any form of leniency... we should be 
immaculate in these respects.’

Lord
 Guthrie, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, agreed and said: ‘The military 
should observe the highest standards, and if some crime is committed, 
like everybody else they should pay the price. Murder is murder.’

Marine A was found guilty by a court 
martial of shooting the injured insurgent in the chest at close range 
with a 9mm pistol, then taunting him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you
 c***.’ 

He was convicted after a two-and-a-half week trial of slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011.

He will be sentenced on December 6 and could face life in prison.

His
 badly injured victim was found with an AK-47 assault rifle and grenade 
following an attack on a British base. He denied murder, claiming he 
thought the insurgent was already dead.

He is the first serviceman to be convicted of murder on active 
service abroad since the Second World War.

His closest friends and family maintain that his killing was out of character.

A family friend told the Mail: ‘We know him and the shooting was not him, it wasn’t in character. He is keeping positive.’

Harrowing: Video from a Marine's helmet camera was shown at the court martial, which captured the moment Blackman murdered the Taliban soldier in this field

Footage: The recording hears the group dragging the man's injured body with the Marines apparently joking about refusing to give first aid

Relatives of troops who died as they served alongside Marine A in 42 
Commando criticised the military authorities for prosecuting him. One 
bereaved father said the decision was ‘inappropriate’. Others said the 
unique psychological pressures of war should be taken into account.

Retired
 Colonel Mike Dewar said it was important to ‘make exceptions for 
soldiers in extraordinary circumstances’. He added: ‘This is a 
completely different environment to a cold-blooded murder in normal 
circumstances.’

The sergeant, a 15-year veteran who 
served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, is preparing a 
last-ditch legal bid to block the release of his name.

His
 legal team plan to appeal against a ruling to lift the anonymity order,
 claiming it breached the commando’s human rights by putting him and his
 family at risk of revenge attacks.

But
 campaigners have warned that letting a convicted murderer hide behind a
 veil of secrecy would seriously undermine the principle of open 
justice. Murderers are usually named by the courts.

Some
 senior retired commanders, including Major General Julian Thompson, who
 led the elite commandos in the Falklands War, have called for leniency 
when Marine A is sentenced.
