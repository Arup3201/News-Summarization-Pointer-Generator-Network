A curiously phallus-shaped prehistoric worm has provided a 'crucial missing link' to understanding the evolution of certain marine creatures, scientists say.

Fossilised remains of the creature dubbed Spartobranchus tenuis were unearthed in Canada's Burgess Shale fossil beds, in the Yoho National Park.

The area is one of the most important fossil deposits for understanding the early evolution of life during an era of increasing biodiversity on Earth known as the Cambrian Explosion, which started about 542million years ago.

Phallic: Scientists say this newly described creature, dubbed Spartobranchus tenuis, is a common ancestor to two related groups of marine invertebrates whose evolutionary link was previously a mystery

Researchers from the University of Montreal today published the first full description of the creature, found in an area thought to be about 505million years old, in the journal Nature.

The strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm, or enteropneust, a seldom seen animal that thrives today in the fine sands and mud of shallow and deeper waters.

'Unlike animals with hard parts including teeth, scales and bones, these worms were soft-bodied, so their fossil record is extremely rare,' said study author Dr Chris Cameron.

'Our description of Spartobranchus tenuis, a creature previously unknown to science, pushes the fossil record of the enteropneusts back 200million years to the Cambrian period, fundamentally changing our understanding of biodiversity from this period.'

Detailed analysis suggests 
Spartobranchus tenuis had a flexible body consisting of a short 
proboscis, collar and narrow elongate trunk terminating in a bulbous 
structure, which may have served as an anchor.

The largest complete specimens examined 
were 10cm long with the proboscis accounting for about half a 
centimetre. It is thought they probably fed on small particles filtered 
from seawater.

'Crucial missing link': The strange-looking invertebrate is thought to be a previously unknown ancestor of the acorn worm, or enteropneust, and the sea stars and sea urchins, known as pterobranchs

Enteropneusts, Spartobranchus's modern
 day descendants, are themselves part of the hemichordates, a group of 
marine animals closely related to today's sea stars and sea urchins, 
known as pterobranchs.

Since
 their discovery in the 19th-century, some of the biggest questions in 
hemichordate evolution have focused on the group's origins and the 
relationship between these two branches.

The
 Cambrian explosion, or Cambrian radiation, was the relatively rapid 
appearance, around 530million years ago, of most major animal phyla, as 
demonstrated in the fossil record.

Before
 about 580million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of 
individual cells occasionally organized into colonies.

Over
 the following 70 or 80million years, the rate of evolution accelerated 
by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and 
origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble
 that of today.

It ended with the Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event, approximately 488million years ago. 

Enteropneusts and pterobranchs look very different, yet share many genetic and developmental characteristics that reveal an otherwise unexpected close relationship.

Professor Simon Conway Morris from the
 University of Cambridge, who also worked on the study, told the BBC: 
'Enteropneusts look very different from pterobranchs in as much as the 
former are worms, whereas the latter are tiny animals, live in tubes, 
are colonial and have feeding tentacles.'

The
 new insights into Spartobranchus tenuis has shown that it was a common 
ancestor of both groups, finally providing the missing evolutionary link
 between these two groups, the researchers say.

'One
 of the big punchlines from my graduate work, was molecular evidence 
that enteropneusts and pterobranchs are closely related,' added Dr 
Cameron, who specialises in the taxonomy, evolution and biogeography of 
hemichordates.

'It's 
astonishing how similar Spartobranchus tenuis fossils are to modern day 
acorn worms, except that they also formed fibrous tubes.'

A large proportion of these worms was 
preserved in tubes, of which some were branched, suggesting the tubes 
were used as a dwelling structure.

'The explosive radiation of 
graptolites in the Paleozoic planktonic ecosystems is known only from 
the diversity of their tubes,' said Dr Cameron.

'Our
 findings suggest that the tubes were lost in the lineage leading to 
modern day enteropneusts, but elaborated on in graptolites and retained 
to the present day in pterobranchs.'

Hemichordates
 also share many of the same characteristics as chordates – a group of 
animals that includes humans – with the name hemichordate roughly 
translating to 'half a chordate.'
