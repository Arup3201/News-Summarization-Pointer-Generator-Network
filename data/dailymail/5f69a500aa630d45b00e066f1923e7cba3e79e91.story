A fire has destroyed one of two memorials at the site where 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.

Ferguson resident Meldon Moffitt said the fire started around 6:30 a.m. Tuesday on Canfield Drive, the street where Brown was fatally shot Aug. 9 by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

About two dozen residents gathered at the site Tuesday morning, many of them angry. One man said it was like a grave being desecrated.

Ferguson resident Marcus Henley told MSNBC 'I woke up to it. They light candles with no problem. I think somebody set it on fire. And that says a lot to me.'

Ferguson police spokesman Devin James says the cause of the fire is under investigation.

Police Chief Tom Jackson said in a statement to KSDK 'We're all saddened by the fire that was reported at one of the Michael Brown Memorials this morning and are trying to obtain as much information as possible to determine what happened. At this time the cause is unknown.

'To anyone who believes we didn't do everything in our power to put this fire out I want to apologize and let you know that was not the case. Some of our police cars are equipped with an emergency kit that includes a fire extinguisher and Sgt. (Harry) Dilworth was first on the scene and attempted to put the fire out but couldn't so he alerted the Fire Department and they ultimately put out the fire.

'Anyone who has any information or videos please reach out to us as this will help as we investigate this incident.'

'There was no way a candle did this. That fire was burning too high and too hot,' David Whitt told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 

KMOV reporter Laura Hettiger, who was on the scene, tweeted the fire took place at 'around 6:40' and that no one was injured. 

Brown's death led to several days of protests and unrest in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Investigations into the shooting by a state grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice are ongoing.
