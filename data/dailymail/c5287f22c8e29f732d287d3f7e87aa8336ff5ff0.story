Anderson Cooper has explained his mysterious disappearance from the air on Monday night, explaining that he had to undergo emergency surgery.

The 47-year-old was absent from his show Anderson Cooper 360 yesterday, but there was no explanation as to why.

The popular anchor took to Twitter to clear the air and calm his fans, posting that he had undergone surgery to remove his appendix on Sunday.

In recovery: Anderson Cooper underwent emergency surgery to remove his appendix on Sunday night

The New York-born journalist was nowhere to be seen during Monday night's show, and had been substituted for John Berman.

Despite Anderson Cooper's notable absence, Mr Berman made no mention of him during the show's opening or closing.

Instead, the anchor himself explained on social media: 'I'll be back on air tomorrow. 

'Had an appendicitis and had to have sudden surgery last night.'

Appendicitis can become life threatening if the appendix bursts, which is why surgery is carried out urgently once the condition has been established. 

Appendectomies are the most common emergency operation performed in the US, with more 300,000 per year undergoing the surgery. 

Meanwhile, the surreal feud between Anderson Cooper and Billy Corgan has been taken to the next level by the Smashing Pumpkins singer. 

Last month, Mr Cooper made a joke about Mr Corgan losing his rocker credentials by posing on a cat magazine with his pets, a pair of Siamese called Sammi and Mr Thom.

The Smashing Pumpkins frontman did not take the joke lightly, calling Mr Cooper a 'globalist shill' in a tweet.

But it seems Billy Corgan was not satisfied with a tweet, making his feelings about the news anchor clear via merchandise sold at his concerts.

At Smashing Pumpkins's show on Wednesday night, a T-shirt on sale featured a picture of Corgan's pet cats, captioned: 'F*** You Anderson Cooper.'
