Veteran Joe Perry claimed the biggest prize of his professional career as he beat Mark Williams to win the Players Championship on Saturday.

After seeing off Stuart Bingham with ease in their Bangkok semi-final, Cambridge cueman Perry seemed to have run out of steam as he fell 3-0 down to final opponent Williams.

With Williams an experienced final player and having beaten Judd Trump in the semis, there looked to be no way back for Perry as the two-time World Champion rattled in breaks of 64, 57 and 103.

But Perry found some resolve and after taking a scrappy frame to stay alive reeled off three breaks north of 50 to get over the line 4-3 and take a first ranking title at the age of 40, as well as a winner's cheque for £100,000.

Williams had earlier beaten World Grand Prix champion Trump 4-2. He was never behind against the Englishman - who top-scored with a fine 102 - and got over the line with runs of 74 and 85.

Perry was also a comfortable last-four winner, keeping Bingham to one frame in a 4-1 victory. Perry top-scored with an opening-frame 86 and then reeled off three in a row after Bingham had levelled at 1-1.
