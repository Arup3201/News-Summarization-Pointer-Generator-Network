A Canadian performer has become the first burlesque dancer to be awarded a green card based on her 'extraordinary ability' and is now making the most of it by touring the U.S.

Last fall, Bettina May, who moved to New York from Victoria in 2010, was granted one of the 4,000 extraordinary ability EB-1A green cards approved in the country in 2012.

Applicants - from artists, athletes, scientists, educators and entrepreneurs - must prove they are top in their field with reams of evidence, from media coverage, awards and a hefty salary.

A third of applications were rejected last year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

For May, the process took around a year and a half, and required a six-inch-thick dossier to show that burlesque was an art form, and that she was unlike any other performer in the country.

The file included newspaper clippings from across the country, a tape of her appearance on the 'Real Housewives', box office sales and letters of recommendation, NBC reported.

'I was a wreck, thinking at any minute 
they're going to tell me you have to leave the country,' she said. 'Itâ€™s
so hard to live your life that way. What do I do if I get kicked out?'

But the good news finally came last fall after she had spent $10,000 in legal fees.

'I have never been so excited about a piece of plastic,' May told NBC. 'And it's actually green!'

May studied political science and worked for the Canadian government before she found a burlesque troupe that was the beginning of her love affair.

She decided 
to leave Canada simply because there were more opportunities for her 
work in the U.S.

'I love Canada and it's a wonderful 
country and it's a great place to live but as an entertainer I really 
need to be somewhere with a dense population,' she said.

'Every musical that has ever inspired me
in my career is all about going to New York and making it big on the 
stage. I just wanted to be that girl.'

Performer: She said she brings vintage glamor to the art form and channels 1940s stars such as Rita Hayworth

She will have to renew the green card after 10 years or she can apply for citizenship in five.

Her attorney, Jan Brown, told the New York Daily News she believes May is the first burlesque dancer to qualify for the visa.

'We certainly had to go the distance to 
convince USCIS that she qualified under their criteria,' he said. 'The 
bottom line is she really is one of the best pin-up models and burlesque
artists.'

May said she stands out as different because of her vintage take on burlesque; she is inspired by 1940s stars including Rita Hayworth and Betty Grable.

A devoted vegan, she also designs costumes that look the part but do not use leather, fur or feathers. She also hosts pin-up model makeovers across the country.

Here for good: She wanted to leave Canada as her opportunities as a performer were better in the U.S

Despite being at the top of her field, the fact that a burlesque dancer was given a green card may make it appear they are easy to get.

This is simply not the case, said attorney Michael Wildes, who helped Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Australian golfer Greg Norman achieve theirs.

'We have seen over the years it's harder to get these cases approved,' said Wildes told NBC. 'We've seen the government go through [applications] with a surgical knife.'

For May, all the paperwork was worth it.

'It's great that I'm able to make a living doing what I love doing and in the place that I want to do it,' she said.
