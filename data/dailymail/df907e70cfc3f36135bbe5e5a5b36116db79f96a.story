Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has told supporters that the club would consider sharing a ground while waiting for their new stadium to be built.

Spurs announced in April that they hope to complete the £400million Northumberland Park Development project and move into a new stadium for 2017, although that date could be forced back unless a public enquiry is resolved.

Speaking to the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, Levy admitted that stadium-sharing was looking increasingly likely - with Wembley, the Olympic Stadium and Milton Keynes Stadiummk being considered as possible venues, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Let's get together! Daniel Levy has confirmed that Tottenham would consider ground-sharing

A move to the Olympic Stadium could potentially see a ground-share with local rivals West Ham - who won a battle against Tottenham to move into the stadium as anchor tennants for the 2016 - 2017 season.

Levy also used the discussion to defend the constant change of managers during his tenure at White Hart Lane.

The chairman is searching for his eighth manager since arriving at the club in 2001, and his fifth in six years following the dismissal of Tim Sherwood.

Levy insists that most clubs have adopted the same strategy, while claiming north London rivals Arsenal and Manchester United were the exceptions.

Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax coach Frank de Boer are the favourites for the position.
