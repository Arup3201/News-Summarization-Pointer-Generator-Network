It’s a question men often ponder as they talk to females on the phone: ‘Is this woman as attractive as she sounds?’

Now scientists claim to have found the answer: she probably is.

Women who sound sexy tend to have more feminine faces – with higher cheekbones, softer jawlines and fuller lips – than those with more humdrum voices, academics have discovered.

And their faces are usually symmetrical, a telltale sign in both sexes of good genes.

It means there is good reason why women with famously sultry voices, like broadcaster Mariella Frostrup and actress Scarlett Johansson look as attractive as they sound.

Scientists at Austria’s University of Vienna believe men have evolved to use the sound of a woman’s voice as a ‘back-up signal’ to better gauge how fertile they are.

Writing in the journal Evolution And Human Behaviour, they said relying on more than one indicator – in other words, both sight and sound – ‘ensures a low rate of mate choice error’. 

They photographed 42 female students, most in their 20s, as well as recording their voices, spoken in a normal manner.

They found those women who sounded attractive to a panel of men also tended to be so in the flesh. 

They had smaller faces, their eyes were further apart, and they had smaller noses and chins, and larger lips. 

Somewhat unromantically, Dr Peter Abend, who led the research, said what men were hearing in an attractive woman’s voice was the fact that her vocal cords, larynx and nasal cavity were well aligned. 

Consequently, an attractive voice gave away the fact that a woman had a symmetrical face.
