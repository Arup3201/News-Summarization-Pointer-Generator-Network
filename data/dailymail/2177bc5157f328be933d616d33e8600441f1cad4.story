The yacht includes a sprawling 860-square foot living room, a galley, office, gymnasium and a 540-square foot master stateroom with an outdoor terrace.

The suite features a separate dressing room and en-suite bathroom.

Also on the main deck are a kitchen and dining area.

Buyers are also being given the opportunity to tweak the design to their own specifications.

The lower deck offers plenty of space for a 12-person motor dinghy, two personal watercraft, four sea bobs, and a diving set.

The Sunreef Power 115 has been created by the company's Gdansk-based yard in Poland.

It can also accommodate six crew members and will manage a top speed of 30 knots.

The company's website said: 'Power was designed for the type of client who truly loves everything a catamaran has to offer, especially the large open spaces and increased stability, but one who also admires the sleek look of superyachts.'

Sunreef have designed and created more 60 superyachts since they were set up in 2002.

The company is now a world leader in the design and construction of large, customised luxury catamarans.

MatrixLloyd, the global authority on superyacht purchase and ownership, estimates that the Sunreef Power 115 would cost up to £10 million to have built, depending on the specification.

It is also estimated that it could be chartered for around £100,000 per week.

A spokesman said: 'With a twin-hull catamaran design, the vessel will be more stable and comfortable at sea than more conventional craft - especially when guests are enjoying lunch at anchor.'
