Leigh Halfpeny will wonder what he has let himself in for, even if the Wales full back doesn’t have his contract at Toulon torn up, in line with the owner’s threats.

In a barmy week on the balmy Cote d’Azur, Mourad Boudjellal warned he may release Halfpenny, who is yet to play for his new French employers due to a persistent groin injury. 

He also threatened to take legal action if Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe, Bryan Habana and Bakkies Botha don’t nip back from the Rugby Championship on the other side of the equator to line up against Brive on Friday.

Toulon have threatened to tear up Leigh Halfpenny's contract over a persistent groin injury

Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal has threatened legal action against players away on internationals

Instead of taking the matter to court, he will probably adjust their pay instead. Rory Lamont, the ex-Scotland full back who had a spell at Toulon, tweeted on Thursday: ‘I came back from the autumn internationals to find out I had been docked a month’s wages. Standard behaviour.’

Toulon and other leading Gallic clubs have engaged in a big-money duel over Galactico imports, only for the thorny issue of international release to crop up time after time. The up-shot is tension and turmoil. Wales coach Warren Gatland says that many of his players based across the Channel want to leave, while Jonathan Sexton is abandoning Racing Metro at the first opportunity, next summer, to return to Leinster.

Boudjellal and other wealthy owners have carte blanche to recruit as they see fit, but it is ridiculous to willingly sign current Test players then carp when they go off to fulfil international duties. Rest weekends are a grey area, but the simple solution is to target the domestic market – or Test exiles such as Matt Giteau, who has agreed a new deal at Toulon – rather than mostly shopping abroad.

There is a lesson for Aviva Premiership clubs here, following their decision to raise the salary cap and allow for another – overseas – signing outside the cap. A post-World Cup boom here would increase the temptation to go star shopping, but it is vital to retain the precious emphasis on nurturing home-grown talent, while carefully adding box-office appeal.

Culture is a factor too. Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, struck the right note when asked about big-name imports, saying: ‘That is not Leicester’s way of doing business. It upsets the balance. We want guys to be here for the long haul.’

The English elite should note the scatter-gun approach of Boudjellal & Co, with all the attendant problems, and resolve to fire their golden bullets with more care. 

James Haskell (R) staked his claim for England with a commanding performance against Northampton

It is all working out exactly as Stuart Lancaster would have hoped. 

Having secured agreement from the Premiership clubs to delay the announcement of his England squads for the season, the national coach is witnessing contenders raising their games for early-season auditions. 

Last Sunday, Wasps captain James Haskell delivered a colossal defensive display in the win over Northampton, to put further pressure on the back-row incumbents. His personal challenge to the established hierarchy has been matched by a trio of Saracens; centre Brad Barritt, scrum half Richard Wigglesworth and flanker Will Fraser, not to mention Exeter’s rookie midfield pair – Sam Hill and Henry Slade. 

In addition, the fly half tussle is a high-class sideshow in its own right, with Danny Cipriani, George Ford and Stephen Myler taking it in turns to excel as they strive to deputise for Owen Farrell or even usurp him. Test cases are being made with heartening regularity for the England coaches. Now they just have to hope that the exuberant efforts don’t lead to a pile-up of injuries…

The architect of New Zealand’s World Cup triumph in 2011 has warned that the All Blacks may have trouble retaining their title if they keep winning. 

Steve Hansen’s dominant side have lost just once since the last global tournament and haven’t been beaten at home since 2009, but Graham Henry doesn’t think that is entirely good news. ‘I think they need to lose,’ he said. 

Graham Henry believes New Zealand must lose if they want to retain the World Cup

‘The odd hiccup here and there gives you the opportunity to re-analyse where you are at, look at everything, turn over every stone; make sure you're on the right track. If you don’t do that you might miss something. I think (a loss) galvanises people.’ 

New Zealand face Argentina, Tonga, Georgia and Namibia in their World Cup pool next year. There is a very real threat that they could progress serenely between now and the quarter-finals, then find themselves caught cold, as they were under Henry in 2007. 

Australia are attempting to lure the Lions back to their shores in 2017, even though Britain and Ireland’s finest were there for a tour last year. 

In a bid to generate much-needed income, the ARU have made a pitch to stage a warm-up match before the Lions arrive in New Zealand. 

Chief executive Bill Pulver said: ‘If they want preliminary games outside New Zealand, then we would be a wonderful location. We would take it in a heartbeat.’ 

Australia want to lure the British Lions back after they played an opener in Hong Kong last year

Last year, the Lions stopped off in Hong Kong for a tour opener prior to landing Down Under, in what was an overwhelmingly commercial venture. This Australian offer must be politely rebuffed. New Zealand can deliver enough suitable, pre-Test series opposition to make a game outside that country unnecessary. 

But if one is to take place, the Lions should take their high-profile roadshow to where it can do some good; the Pacific islands. If trips to any one of the SANZAR nations became more regular than the current once-every-12-years routine, the aura and the magic will be lost. These Lions should be rare attractions.

The Last Word 

The RFU have blundered into a storm this week, in relation to the new England kits.

The inclusion of Victoria Cross symbols within the fabric of the shirt led to accusations of disrespecting military sacrifice. But this was clumsy, rather than a crass insult to servicemen and women. 

Lancaster has invoked the country’s armed forces repeatedly as a source of inspiration, without suggesting that the heroism required on a rugby field equates to that needed in armed conflict. This is a game in which courage is a pre-requisite, but it is not a life-and-death exercise. 

The inclusion of the Victoria Cross in England's new shirts has kicked up controversy

Bill Shankly once said football meant more than that, while warfare terminology has long abounded in sport. The 1991 Ryder Cup in golf was dubbed the ‘War on the Shore’. 

More recently, South Africa’s Blue Bulls have worn army-camouflage kit. George Orwell referred to sport as ‘war minus the shooting’ and the tribalism involved has led to endless talk of battles, which largely amounts to harmless hype. 

The use of Victoria Crosses on the England shirt is an error of judgment and the RFU have duly apologised. The underlying concept of national service was well-intentioned, but the symbolism was mis-guided.
