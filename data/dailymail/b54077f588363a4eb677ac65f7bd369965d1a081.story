Marilyn Brown, 78, has been jailed for stealing £55,000 from her best friend of almost 70 years

A heartless pensioner has been jailed for stealing £55,000 from her widowed best friend of almost 70 years.

Callous Marilyn Brown, 78, spent years systematically defrauding pal Frances Tarne out of her inheritance following the death of her husband.

Despite being best friends since childhood cruel Brown took total control of her finances and sent her just £75-a-fortnight to live.

Trusting Frances, also 78, was left living in near poverty in Brighton while greedy Brown splashed her money on herself and her home in Christchurch, Dorset.

The alarm was raised when friends visited widowed Frances and found her living in squalor in June 2011 despite being left a tidy sum by her husband.

Mean Brown had left her with so little money she could not afford a headstone for her husband's grave.

She also cancelled her TV licence and cable TV package and took away her car.

Brown pleaded guilty to theft on the day of her planned trial in November and last Thursday was jailed for 18 months at Hove Crown Court.

Judge Shani Barnes said: 'Your old friend who you had known since childhood lost her husband and something in you went seriously wrong.

'Whether it was jealousy, whether it was greed or something else, you systematically stole from her all that she had.

'You removed her dignity, her confidence and everything she believed to be true. You took away her health, her money, her pension, her trust.

'If you were 20 years younger, you would be going to prison for three years, no question.'

Detective Constable Tracey Dixon said: 'I remain astounded that the victim's all but lifelong friend could be so callous and so cruel.

'She didn't even order or pay for a headstone for her deceased husband's grave.

'I am very pleased with the sentence that Marilyn Brown has received.'
