Britain's Chemmy Alcott, 31, pictured celebrating after coming 19th in the ladies' downhill at the Sochi Olympics

For skier Chemmy Alcott the 19th place in the women’s Olympic downhill on the mountains above Sochi today was as good as a gold medal after the glamour girl dubbed Britain’s ‘bionic woman’ defied medical science to compete in Russia.

The 31-year-old is a testament to the skill of surgeons and her own courage having overcome an astonishing 42 fractures and four career threatening breaks - one where her ankle bone ripped through her ski boot - to ski in her fourth Winter Olympics.

She only returned to the competitive ski slopes in January after a broken leg and took part in an historic race that saw the first ever tie in the history of the Winter Games when Dominique Gisin, of Switzerland, and Slovenian Tina Maze recorded exactly the same time to share the gold medal in the alpine downhill.

Miss Alcott, who credited her friend 
Zara Phillips with helping her overcome her horrific injuries and reach 
Sochi, finished 1.86 seconds behind the pair but was jubilant as she 
finished, breaking into a huge smile, punching the air three times and 
shouting : 'Yes, Woo...’

Still
 beaming minutes later, she said : ‘I know it sounds crazy to some 
people, especially when we have such a strong team here in Sochi, but 
19th is a gold for me.

‘After what I’ve been through, it’s amazing justice. I’m swelling with pride and I’m on a buzz.’

Seven
 other skiers fell yesterday in difficult conditions, and Miss Alcott 
admitted she had been as ‘loose and a goose’ on the course.

She added : ‘When I made the commitment to come here it was about personal goals. I never put any statistics on it, if I had then top 20 would have been massively over super-ceding what I expected. I’ve done this against all odds and I’m very proud.’

Those odds could not have been more heavily stacked against the former Dancing on Ice star, who finished 11th in both the Turin and Vancouver Olympics, after a life of crippling injuries that began at the age of 12 when she broke her neck and had two vertebrae fused together.

In Sochi, she carries around an X-ray of her neck in case she is in an accident and doctors want to prize the vertebrae open.

Other injuries sustained since she first put on a pair of skis at the age of 18 months have injured a broken jaw, broken bones in both arms and legs, damage to the head and face - her goggles cut into her left eyebrow - back and pelvis. She needed surgery on bone spurs in her feet, broke an ankle and has other problems with damage to her feet.

She has broken her right leg three times and three years ago feared she might die after an 80mph crash on the slopes in Lake Louise, Canada, that saw her airlifted on a stretcher from the slopes.

‘When I was coming down the mountain, on a stretcher beneath the helicopter, I thought I was dying. I have never known pain like it,’ she said.

‘I could feel my leg was hot and 
moist...from photographs, I have been shown that my ski boot liner had 
become lodged inside my leg with bones and blood everywhere. The doctors
 were pretty shocked.’ A 38cm rod holding her bones together was locked 
inside her leg.

‘It goes all the way from my ankle to my knee, and I have a few screws in there,’ she said, ‘But I will do anything for the sport.’

That determination was to be again threatened in August when she broke the same leg again, an injury that put her Sochi place in doubt until the last minute.

She took the highly unusual move of writing to the ski team’s chief, asking for a Sochi place and promising she would be fit to compete despite medical fears.

She pays tribute to the Queen’s daughter Zara Phillips, an Olympic equestrian medallist in London 2012, as playing a key part in her recovery from the worst of her injuries.

Miss Alcott said : ‘After my first big accident, which was back in 2010, I felt like I wanted to escape a little bit. Zara invited me to come and stay with her for a while and watch her train. Well, I have never seen anyone train as hard as her.

‘We would get up at 6.30am most mornings. I would watch her train for an hour and a half on one horse. I’d say: ‘That’s great. Can we can get some breakfast now?’ But she’d reply: “I have got four other horses to do this on”. I couldn’t believe it.

‘As an athlete, you always think you work harder than everyone else. But when I saw Zara and what she does, I just had a massive respect for her as both an athlete and as a person.’

However, it is not only physical injury that Miss Alcott, whose full name is Chimene after Sophia Loren’s character in the 1961 film ‘El Cid’, but also finding the money to chase her Olympic dream.

Apart from renting out a room in her Surrey home, she and her fiancé, alpine skier Dougie Crawford, organised a Question of Sport-themed black-tie dinner for more than 170 guests, including fellow stars of Dancing on Ice, that raised £36,000 to pay for training.

Miss Alcott’s final race - she has said this is her last Olympics - will be in the Super G slalom on Saturday.
