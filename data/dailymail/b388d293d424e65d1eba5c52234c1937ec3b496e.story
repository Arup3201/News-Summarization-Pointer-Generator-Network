A couple donned Santa costumes during their wedding ceremony before being waved off in a sleigh.

Terminally-ill Harry Paul, 56, and Margaret Steward, 65, were joined by more than 50 guests in fancy dress outfits, including Snow White, elves and snowmen, at their party.

The best man was dressed as a Christmas cracker, while two elf maidens were the bridesmaids and the seven dwarves even made an appearance.

The children dressed as a Christmas pudding and little elves with the family's dogs Marley, seven, and Layla, one, were Santa's helper and snowman outfits.

Other guests dressed in costumes included Minnie and Mickey Mouse and the Stig from BBC's Top Gear.

The extravaganza, which included children dressed as a Christmas pudding and little elves, was organised by Mr Paul's sister Anna Webster, 52, on a shoestring.

The mother-of-two transformed her home in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, into a winter wonderland before the couple, who married on Saturday, left for honeymoon in a sleigh.

Mrs Webster said: 'It was absolutely fantastic and we all had a great time.

'My brother and Maggie said it was a day they will never forget.'

Mr Paul, from Cambridge, added: 'It all seemed to have just snowballed from a quiet wedding to a Christmas theme - but I am up for a laugh.'

Margaret and Harry, who have been together for eight years, met at a Christmas party on Boxing Day.

Harry suffers from incurable disease sapho - a painful rare bone disorder which forced him to retire six years ago.

The couple married at Shire Hall Register Office in Cambridge and are honeymooning in a static home at the bottom of Mrs Webster's garden.
