A police force has been slammed for spending £5,000 on its latest weapon to fight crime - a flower garden.

Officers from Avon and Somerset Police claim the initiative in St Andrew's Park, Bristol, has already had a 'remarkable effect' on reducing anti-social behaviour after it was unveiled last month. 

Nearly 15,000 seeds for 12 species, including poppies, cosmos and cornflowers, were paid for by police grant, and the force say it has helped 'sooth' would-be criminals.

Flower power? Officers from Avon and Somerset Police claim the garden in St Andrew's Park, Bristol, has had a 'soothing' impact on would-be criminals 

Criticisied: Nearly 15,000 seeds for 12 species were paid for by police grant

But yesterday pressure groups warned costs for schemes should not be allowed to spiral and instead should be spent on 'visible and available' policing.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'There’s nothing wrong with trying to improve an area’s image, but costs for schemes like this must be kept down.

'There could a temptation to spend even more taxpayers’ cash on it, but it’s crucial that as much money as possible is spent on visible and available policing in local areas.' 

It is set to be unveiled by Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens alongside local residents who claim the initiative has changed their life.

Juliana Hounsfield, who lives nearby said: 'The effect has been absolutely extraordinary.

'It’s changed my life, everyone is taking pictures of the flowers, little children run through them, adults sit among them peacefully, no one can believe how beautiful it has become in short space of time.

Trouble: The initiative was prompted by complaints of anti-social behaviour including drinking and vandalism

Change: The new garden was unveiled last month and residents say it has already had a 'remarkable impact'

Transformation: Local residents and councillors had previously complained of loud music, vandalism, drunkenness and having their front gardens used as urinals 

'These flowers have had an extraordinary effect on everyone using the park.'

Local residents and councillors had previously complained of loud music, vandalism, drunkenness and having their front gardens used as urinals.

But since the seeding of the flowers earlier this year, they have reported a dramatic decrease in crime, claiming once the flowers bloomed the whole atmosphere changed.

The scheme was devised by the Friends of St Andrew’s Park, Bishopston and Redland beat manager, PC Kevin Parsons, and the city council.

It has been funded for three years with £5,000 from the Community Action Fund set up by Sue Mountstevens.

Two-dimensional: An officer using a cardboard cutout 

Last month it was revealed that police have spent more than £50,000 on cardboard cut-outs of themselves since 2008 - despite most forces admitting they do not know if they stop crime.

The two-dimensional crime fighters are supposed to deter shoplifters and petrol thieves who think they are real PCs from a distance.

But some have become victims of crime themselves after being stolen by pranksters or vandalised. 

Earlier this year, residents in Durham were left baffled after they noticed gnomes dressed in police uniforms lining the streets. 

The aim of the 10 ornaments was to act as the centrepiece of campaign to highlight the danger of theft, drink-driving and shoplifting.

In 2010, police blew £1.5million on promotional gifts that were supposed to build links with the public.

Critics pointed out the cost could have paid for an extra 29 beat officers and were condemned by campiagners as 'useless trinkets'. 

In 2009 police in Tiverton, Devon, were branded disgraces after they spray-painted their station in graffiti in a desperate attempt to engage with youngsters. 

In 2008, Hampshire Police and Portsmouth City Council launched their own version of police Top Trumps, because they wanted their officers to look 'cool'.
