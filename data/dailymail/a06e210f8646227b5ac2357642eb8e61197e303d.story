Behind the numerous benefits of self-driving cars, being touted by Google and other manufacturers, an imminent danger is lurking.

The technology could see criminals using the cars in high-speed chases, for example, or to shoot out of the window while the car drives itself.

In fact, the FBI is so concerned about the threats they pose, the agency has dubbed them ‘potential leathal weapons’ in a recent report.

Files detail the FBI's concerns about self-driving vehicles, (Google's autonomous car pictured). The report said: 'Autonomy...will open up ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today.' For example, criminals could shoot out of the window while the car drives itself

The files were obtained by Mark Harris at The Guardian.

Google began by installing its self-driving technology to cars including the Toyota Prius and Lexus RX450h in 2012.

In May, the tech giant unveiled its own 25mph self-driving car, with a smiley face.

Tesla Boss Elon Musk has also announced plans to launch a range of autonomous cars by 2016.

Autonomous vehicles extend beyond cars, however, and also include the self-driving military trucks recently tested in Texas.

The
 demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive
 Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed 
Martin in Maryland.

Called
 the Unmanned Mission Module, the technology used in the trucks and 
Google’s cars included a high performance LIDAR sensor - or laser radar.

They were revealed during a public records request, and detail the FBI’s concerns about autonomous vehicles.

It said: 'Autonomy…will make mobility more efficient, but will also open up greater possibilities for dual-use applications and ways for a car to be more of a potential lethal weapon than it is today.’

The technology is currently only legal in four states, including Nevada, Florida, California and Michigan, while European Union laws currently call for drivers to control their cars at all times.

But Europe, Germany, Netherlands and Spain have allowed testing robotic cars in traffic, and Finland is planning on passing a law before next year.

These concerns extend beyond Google’s smart cars, too.

Autonomous vehicles referenced in the report also include the self-driving military trucks recently tested in Texas.

The demonstration was a joint project between the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Centre (TARDEC) and Lockheed Martin in Maryland.

Each of the driverless tactical vehicles were tested on their abilities to navigate hazards and obstacles including road intersections, oncoming traffic, stalled and passing vehicles, pedestrians and traffic circles in both urban and rural test areas.

The technology includes a high performance LIDAR sensor, or laser radar. This remote sensing technology is capable of scanning the road ahead (pictured) and measuring distances by illuminating a target with a laser, and analysing the light reflected. The technology is also fitted with a GPS receiver to plan, and track routes

The FBI report isn’t completely negative, though. It also claims law enforcement officers will be able to easily track the cars, and use algorithms  to ‘control the distance that the patrol car is behind the target’ to avoid detection.

According to the report, the autonomous cars could be approved for public use by Congress by 2020.
