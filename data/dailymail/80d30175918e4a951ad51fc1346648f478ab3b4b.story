The New York City subway could be getting sliding doors on some platforms following another person's fatal push onto the tracks.

The Metropolitan Transit Authority said yesterday that they are revisiting the possibility of installing sliding doors at some stations so it would only be possible to board the train when the screens are opened in-synch with the doors to the car.

Fifty-four people died on subway tracks this year alone, the MTA said.

News of the development comes as schizophrenic Andrew Goldstein, who infamously shoved Kendra Webdale onto the tracks in front of an oncoming train, said that there should be harsher regulations to prevent more senseless deaths.

Options: A man was killed at the 40th St-Lowry St Station in Queens after being pushed on the tracks; the MTA could again look into installing sliding screens

Underground: The Westminster train station on London's Jubilee line is one such station that has sliding doors installed

Speaking exclusively to the New York Post, Goldstein said that Kendra’s Law, the act that was passed following her murder in 1999, needs to be stricter.

‘Should you let a mental patient like myself be in freedom so an incident like train-pushing can occur?’ he asked from the Sullivan Correctional Institute in Fallsburg, New York. ‘If you are a harm to anyone, even yourself, you should be hospitalized.’

Kendra’s Law states that people in New York state who have certain mental illnesses must undergo regular psychiatric treatment.

The law does not go as far as to force patients to take medications against their will.

Goldstein, however, is now on medication and is lucid. In 2006, he was sentenced to 23 years for shoving Ms Webdale into an oncoming N train at 23rd St.

The Post notes that while Kendra’s Law exists to protect the mentally ill from hurting themselves and others, it must be renewed every five years. In addition, there are certain loopholes allowing mentally ill New Yorkers to remain out on the streets.

Horrific: Kendra Webdale was pushed to her death under a subway train as it pulled into a midtown Manhattan station on January 3, 1999

In light of the string of recent subway deaths, MTA executive director Thomas Prendergast said yesterday that ‘we’ll have to revisit’ installing sliding doors in some subway stations. The development was exclusively reported by the  New York Daily News.

There have been talks of installing barriers throughout the years, but each time, the plans have been abandoned for one reason or another, the main reason being the overwhelming cost

According to the Daily News, it could cost as much as $1.5million to install sliding doors on each of the subway’s 468 station platforms.

Neither the 7 line extension nor the Second Ave. subway lines, which are both currently under construction, will get the new technology, an MTA official told the News, saying the construction was ‘cost-prohibitive.’

Mr Prendergast said in March that it was feasible, saying that hundred-year-old subway lines in London and Paris have been modified and modernized to meet safety concerns.

That press conference came after 20-year-old college student Joshua Basin was pushed onto the tracks by a homeless man.

The technology already exists at New York’s AirTrain system, which transports people between terminals at JFK International Airport.

In addition, gates have been installed in many Asian and European cities to prevent these sorts of tragedies from happening.

The latest victim of subway shoving was Sunando Sen, 46, a native of Calcutta, India, who was pushed into the path of an approaching 7 train in Queens by a muttering woman who then fled the 40th street station.

His death marked the second fatal push this month.

Safety: The Paris Metro has installed similar security measures on some of its lines

Mind the gap: In Taipei, sliding doors ensure that no passengers fall onto the tracks

New York city Police commissioner Ray Kelly said that Sen was looking westbound as the train was pulling into the station and likely didn't see the woman leaping from a bench and shoving him at the last moment.

The New York Daily News reported that Sen had been in the U.S. for the past 20 years and lived in Queens in an apartment with at least two roommates.

'I think she's crazy,' Sen's shocked roommate Ar Suman, told the New York Post. 'I can't believe this right now.'

Mr Suman said that the 46-year-old, who 
was single and childless, had just opened a copy shop, the New Amsterdam
Printing Co, with another man on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

'My heart is broken because this guy was so nice and quiet,' added Sen’s other roommate, Md Khan.

On Friday, Sen's business partner was trying to reach the victim's relatives in 
India to deliver them the bad news. 

The suspect was arrested Saturday afternoon along Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, the New York Post reported.

According to the commissioner, 
officers were able to identify Sen using his wallet and laptop that were
recovered at the scene.

On the run: The unidentified woman, captured on surveillance video fleeing the scene, was reportedly muttering to herself

New York Police Department chief 
spokesman Paul Browne said the woman fled the scene after the shocking attack and officers were searching for her.

She
was described as Hispanic, in her 20s, heavyset and about 5-foot-5, 
wearing a blue, white and gray ski jacket and Nike sneakers with gray on
top and red on the bottom.

The man was hit by the first car of an 11-car northbound train and got stuck under the wheels of the second car, Browne said.

According to witnesses, at around 8pm a woman was seen pacing and muttering to herself. She then sat down on a wooden bench at the end of the platform, where she waited until the last possible moment before pushing a man in front of the approaching train.

The NYPD chief added that the victim, who was 
pronounced dead at the scene, had 'terrible injuries that make providing
a description difficult at this time.'

Shocking: Sen was standing on the elevated platform of a 7 train in Queens at about 8pm when he was shoved on the tracks

Browne said there was 'no trend' of 
such horrific occurrences despite the incident being the second of its 
type in the space of a month. 'It's the urban nightmare,' he told Bloomberg.

'It's sometimes in the back of peoples' minds because of the incident preceding this one, but there's no indication that it is related in any way or inspired it,' he said.

During his weekly radio address Friday morning, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that while such attacks were extremely rare, he understood how statistics did not diminish the tragedy for the families of the victims the New York Times reported.

'To say it’s only two in a long period of time doesn’t help either person,' he said. 'I don’t know what happened here.'

Police viewed footage from a 24-hour surveillance camera outside a pizza restaurant located across from the station and were able to obtain clear images of the suspect, according to The New York Times.

'She jumps from the stairs and she just runs,' Oasis Restaurant owner, Giovanni Briones, told the newspaper, describing the video he provided detectives.

He said he did not recognise the woman but that a restaurant regular was on the train and said they felt a bump as it ran over the man. 

On December 3, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han was shoved in front of a train in Times Square.

A photograph of him on the tracks a 
split second before he was killed was published on the front of the New 
York Post the next day, causing an uproar and debate over whether the 
photographer, who had been waiting for a train, should have tried to 
help him and whether the newspaper should have run the image.

Apparently
no one else tried to help up Han, either.

Dead: Ki-Suck Han, pictured, was shoved in front of a train in Times Square

A homeless man, 30-year-old Naeem Davis, was charged with murder in Han's death and is being held without bail.

He has pleaded not guilty, claiming Han was the aggressor and had attacked him first. The two men hadn't met before.

Service was suspended tonight on the 7 train line, which connects Manhattan and Queens, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has been using buses to shuttle riders while police investigate.

Being pushed onto the train tracks is a silent fear for many of the commuters who ride the city's subway a total of more than 5.2 million times on an average weekday, but deaths are rare.

Among the more high-profile cases was the January 1999 death of aspiring screenwriter Kendra Webdale, who was shoved by a former mental patient.

After that, the state Legislature passed Kendra's Law, which lets mental health authorities supervise patients who live outside institutions to make sure they are taking their medications and aren't threats to safety.

On Friday, Mayor Bloomberg said that had some concerns about the state releasing mentally ill people from custody.
