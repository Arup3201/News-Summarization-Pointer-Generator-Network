Dressed for success: Zara Phillips adopts the sporty look yesterday

With her hair scraped back and her tracksuit jacket on, her style is certainly more that of a hard-working Olympian than a glamorous granddaughter of the Queen.

And it seems Zara Phillips will not only look the part at the upcoming Games – she will be living like her fellow competitors, too.

Princess Anne’s daughter is to be given no special treatment, it has emerged, staying in the Olympic village and sharing the same security and transport as other athletes.

Yesterday, she told of her excitement at the prospect of rubbing shoulders with the likes of Usain Bolt during her stay.

The 31-year-old, who missed out on two previous Olympics due to injuries to her horse, promised to give her ‘best performance’ in front of a home crowd in London.

She said: ‘Obviously it will be great to be part of the Olympics and get the atmosphere and the buzz of being a part of it.

‘A lot of the time, the equestrian is quite far out so they’ve made a really big effort this time to try and have us part of the Olympics and benefit from that.’

Miss Phillips, who will ride as part 
of the five-strong eventing team at Greenwich Park, around six miles 
from the main Olympic park, said Her Majesty had been delighted when she
told her that she had made the Olympic team.

Injuries: ‘I’m keeping my fingers crossed because we’ve still got a few weeks to go and we all know what horses are like,’ she said

The
former sports personality of the year missed out on Athens 2004 and 
Beijing 2008 after her then horse, Toytown, suffered late injuries.

‘I’m keeping my fingers crossed because we’ve still got a few weeks to go and we all know what horses are like,’ she said.

Equestrian performance director Will Connell said the eventing team would stay in the Olympic village – and was adamant their royal member would be well protected by the security put in place by Olympics organisers.

‘It’s not an issue,’ he said.
