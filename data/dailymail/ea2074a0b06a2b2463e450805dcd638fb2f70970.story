A doctor in Sweden has come under fierce scrutiny after he glued a 22-month-old child's eyes together.

The youngster whose parents had initially checked him into a hospital after he sustained a gash on his forehead, ended up needing corrective surgery to counter the error.

It is not yet known whether the physician who works at an emergency unit in Gothenburg, in western Sweden will face any investigation.

Tearful: A doctor glued a 22-month-old toddler's eyes shut in Sweden

The parents who filed a report with Sweden's National Board of Health following the incident in December last year, said: 'There was glue over his entire eyelid and under his eye.

'This should never have happened.'

The doctor had used a medical glue to treat the cut, but is alleged to have ignored the trickling of the substance down the child's face.

That eventually resulted in the youngster being rushed into unnecessary surgery, which angered his parents.

They added: 'A little cut resulted in sedation, surgery - with all the risks it entails, and hospitalization in the eye clinic.'

Worryingly for Swedish authorities, this is the second time a doctor has committed the same mistake.

The second case took place in Västerbotten in northern Sweden, just months earlier, when a 4-year-old  had an eye glued shut following treatment for a cut above the eyebrow.

Chief physician at the local county council lamented the actions of the medic in question insisting; 'This can't happen. It's obviously awful for the child and the parents involved.'

Neither child suffered any long-term damage, however more cases of a similar nature are now coming to light.
