A 13-year-old boy has been missing from his Colorado home for six days as police struggle with a lack of clues amid his mother's fears that he 'wouldn't have left willingly.'

Dylan Redwine, of Colorado Springs, was visiting his father in Vallecito for Thanksgiving break under the terms of a court order when he vanished from the home, the father has told police.

His mother says Dylan was unhappy about having to make the trip, but that he would not have run away from home.

Missing: Dylan Redwine, 13, was last seen Monday during a court-ordered visit to his father's home in Vallecito, Colorado for Thanksgiving

'Dylan wouldn't have left willingly,' Elaine Redwine said on Friday during an interview at the home of a friend. 'If there was any way to communicate he would have called.'

The boy's father Mark Redwine told investigators he last saw his son on Monday morning around 7.30 before leaving the home to run errands.

He said his son was gone when he returned.

A neighbour who knows Dylan told police he saw the boy walking along a road in Vallecito the afternoon he went missing but thought nothing of it until hearing the police reports.

Police say they haven't ruled out foul play.

'We have not ruled out any possibility' Dan Bender, Public Information Officer for La Plata Sheriff's Office told 9News. 'This is the fifth day Dylan has been missing with few clues to work from.'

The missing boy is 5 feet tall, weighing 105 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. He was last seen wearing a blue-and-white Duke Blue Devils baseball cap, black Nike T-shirt and black Jordan tennis shoes.

Dylan was picked up Sunday by his father at Durango-La Plata County Airport, his mother said on Friday.

Dylan announced his arrival in a text message and ended it with an emoticon expressing a scowl, she said.

Mrs Redwine added that the boy's father rarely exercises his right to see his own son.

Mr Bender said that the search on Saturday morning would expand to Bayfield, a town south of Vallecito. Other searchers would work near Vallecito Reservoir and on Forest Service roads in the area, he said.

Dozens of area volunteers have helped canvass the county looking for the teen, Mr Bender said.

Elaine Redwine told the newspaper that she doubts her son would have gone into the woods.

'Dylan is a generational kid and tech savvy,' she said. 'He wouldn't have gone to the mountains to pitch a tent or build a fire.'
