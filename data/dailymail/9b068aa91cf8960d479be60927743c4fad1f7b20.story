The heartbroken family of slain ISIS hostage Kayla Mueller have shared her final letter to them from captivity.

Carl and Marsha Mueller and their son Eric, who confirmed that Kayla had died two weeks ago, shared the last note they received from her as they appeared on the Today show on Monday.

'I am OK, healthy, remaining strong and being treated kindly. Do not worry... I love you all,' she wrote in the undated letter.

'My heart longs to be with you all as... I have never felt before, but praise be to God you are in my dreams almost every evening and for just those brief moments in my sleeping conscious that we are together I am given a warmth.

'It's warmth enough for me to wake with a smile. Warmth enough to keep me company through the days, and warmth enough to keep my heart near to home and therefore to God.'

Mueller, who grew up in Prescott, Arizona, was captured in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria as she visited her boyfriend, who was Syrian. 

On February 10, Mueller's family and U.S. officials confirmed that she had died.

The Islamic State group claimed the 26-year-old international aid worker had died in a Jordanian airstrike, but that has not been confirmed. The Pentagon said it didn't know how she was killed.

Her family shared the note as they spoke about their daily battle after she was captured; they worked hard to keep her name out of the press because they feared for her safety.

Her brother said her situation worsened after the government traded five Taliban commanders for a captive U.S. soldier last May.

The militants increased their demands after the U.S. swapped Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl.

Missed: Kayla, 26, was kidnapped while in Syria in August 2013 and ISIS said she died during an airstrike in Jordan, but that has not been confirmed by U.S. officials. ISIS told the family about her death by email

Final words: Her family shared this letter - her last from captivity. She assured them she was being treated kindly but said that she missed them and often felt a 'warmth' when she thought about tem

'That made the whole situation worse because that's when the demands got greater,' he said. 'They got larger. They realized that they had something.' 

His father, Carl Mueller, said that the United States' willingness to swap for Bergdahl but not pay ransom or allow ransom to be paid for his daughter 'was pretty hard to take'.

'I actually asked the president that question when we were in the White House,' Carl Mueller said without elaborating. 

They said they had been instructed to pay $6.2 million for Kayla's release but even if they had been able to raise the money, U.S. government policy would have prohibited them from paying the ransom.

'I really feel that we had a chance to get Kayla out,' said her father Carl, who called his daughter 'SK' - short for 'Special K'. 'We were in communications with them, unlike other families. But how do you raise $6.2 million? You know, it pretty much made it impossible.'

He went on: 'We understand the policy about not paying ransom, but on the other hand, any parents out there would understand that you would want anything and everything done to bring your child home. And we tried, and we asked. But they put policy in front of American citizens' lives. And it didn't get it changed.'

State Department officials have repeatedly said that the government does not pay ransoms to ISIS or exchange prisoners with the militant group.

'The United States government policy, in terms of how we operate, is we don't make concessions to terrorists. That is our policy,' spokeswoman Jen Psaki said during a news conference in January. 

Disappointment: Her mother said she often expected Kayla to walk through the door, as the family said they wished U.S. government policy had allowed them to do more to help their daughter

Questions: They said that when the U.S. government swapped five Taliban fighters for captive soldier Bowe Bergdahl (pictured) last May, the militants holding Kayla made greater demands

Some U.S. lawmakers were outraged by the exchange of five Taliban commanders held at the Guantanamo Bay prison for Bergdahl, an Idaho native who left his post in Afghanistan and was captured and held by the Taliban for five years. 

President Obama's administration has defended the swap.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously supported the exchange, insisting that the United States has a sacred commitment to men and women who serve that it will never leave anyone behind on the battlefield.

Meanwhile, Kayla's mother said that she was still 'in denial' about her daughter's death.

'I still expect Kayla to come through the door,' Marsha Mueller said. 'We always had that little bit of hope that we would always get her home.' 

The family also unveiled a new foundation set up in her memory, Kayla's Hands, devoted to the causes that she felt passionate about.

'She had to be busy with her hands doing something to help people,' her mother said. 'And as long as she was, she was just joyful. She just didn't have enough power as one little person. Maybe we can get the world behind her, or at least behind Kayla's Hands.'

On the Today show on Monday, the Mueller family shared the final letter they received from Mueller while she was imprisoned. The letter does not have a date.

Everyone,

Once again you are being contacted by prisoners who have been released.They will explain to you the situation. As I said in my last letter (that I pray you received from the three women). I am OK, healthy, remaining strong and being treated kindly. Do not worry... I love you all

All that I have said in the previous letter stays true. Give your suffering to the Lord, let our creator support you. Continue to pray, by God I feel your love and your prayers. As I shared with you in my last letter part of a song, I will share with you another. This one I have written for little Lex [Kayla's niece Alexis]: 'Oh my Grace. I close my eyes, you bring me home.' I look towards the day when I can sing to her the rest. I do not know what you have told her, but if it's appropriate, tell her Auntie Kayle sends her big hugs and kisses. Tell her I am very sad that I am far and that we cannot Skype like before, but when I come home we can play, make music together and have so much fun... She's my little Grace and I love her so much.

My heart longs to be with you all as... I have never felt before, but praise be to God you are in my dreams almost every evening and for just those brief moments in my sleeping conscious that we are together I am given a warmth. It's warmth enough for me to wake with a smile. Warmth enough to keep me company through the days, and warmth enough to keep my heart near to home and therefore to God, Mark 12:28-30. 'The first of all the commandments is hear O'Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy souls and with all thy mind and with all thy strength. This is the first commandment.

All my everything,

Kayla
