A family escaped disaster late on Christmas Eve after an overheated light bulb set fire to their roof.

East Sussex Fire and Rescue were called to the scene just 40 minutes before Christmas Day to discover flames reaching more than 20 feet into the sky. 

The family, who have not yet been named, escaped unharmed from the blaze in Uckfield, East Sussex.

It is believed that the blaze started accidentally in the loft of the semi-detached house. Firefighters managed to battle inferno and stop it from spreading to the house next door. 

Local Conservative Party councillor Michael Lunn said the timing of the incident, just minutes before Christmas Day was particularly unfortunate. 

He said: 'It is a very sad incident, but I know the Uckfield  community will rally behind the family.

'We will have an an appeal with the town and district council. 

'The key thing is that everyone is completely safe and we are grateful to the emergency services for their actions.'

Cllr Lunn said the family returned to the house briefly this morning to salvage personal effects and whatever Christmas gifts that had not been destroyed by either smoke or water. 

He added: 'The Uckfield community will always be there to support a family in crisis.'

A spokeswoman for East Sussex Fire and Rescue said: 'Fortunately all persons had managed to get out and were all accounted for.

'Firefighters used breathing apparatus, firefighting foam and main jets to tackle the fire and they gained access to a neighbouring property to stop the fire spreading.

'They also spent time cutting away and salvaging items for the occupants.'

The spokesman added that crews used an aerial ladder platform to remove tiles and make the roof safe.

The family were forced to move out of the property as a result of the extensive fire and water damage. 

Firefighters with breathing apparatus searched the house and managed to rescue some of the presents
