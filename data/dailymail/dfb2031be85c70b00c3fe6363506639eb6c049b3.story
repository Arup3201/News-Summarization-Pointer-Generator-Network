The Immigration Minister sensationally quit last night for employing a Colombian cleaner who was in the country illegally – and he may now be hit with a £5,000 fine.

Mark Harper – tipped to be a future Prime Minister – said he had offered his resignation because he had failed to carry out checks that would have established she was in the UK unlawfully.

He now faces a fine for not keeping copies of the immigration papers shown to him by the cleaner.

Commons records show that the unidentified cleaner, who is now subject to ‘enforcement action’ by border officials, received at least £2,000 from Mr Harper’s Westminster expenses before second home allowances were tightened up.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper has been forced to resign after illegally employing a cleaner

The resignation triggered a mini-Government reshuffle, with a key promotion for Harriett Baldwin

Downing Street said David Cameron had 
accepted Mr Harper’s resignation ‘with regret’ – adding that there was 
‘no suggestion’ the Tory MP had ‘knowingly employed an illegal 
immigrant’.

Mr Harper’s 
resignation triggered a mini-Government reshuffle, with a key promotion 
for Harriett Baldwin, one of George Osborne’s key allies.

Mrs Baldwin, 
53, becomes an Assistant Whip. Fellow Conservative James Brokenshire was
 appointed as the new Immigration Minister.

Mr
 Harper, 43, who was ranked second only to Home Secretary Theresa May in
 the Home Office pecking order, first employed the cleaner at his South 
London second home in April 2007.

At the time, he had been the MP for 
Forest of Dean for two years.

In
 his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Harper said he had 
been ‘mindful’ of his obligation to make checks including ‘her right to 
work in the UK’.

He made a 
copy of both her passport, to establish her identity, and a Home Office 
letter she handed him which stated that she had leave to remain 
indefinitely in the country.

Government
 sources said yesterday that as it was a ‘live operational matter’ they 
could not say about how the cleaner came to be in possession of a letter
 that gave false details about her right to be in the country.

Controversial: Mr Harper was behind the Home Office's 'go home' vans, which were later deemed distasteful and withdrawn

However,
 previous Home Office investigations have shown that illegal immigrants 
can obtain fake passports – and supporting documentation – with relative
 ease.

When Mr Harper was 
appointed as a Cabinet Office Minister after the 2010 Election he 
‘considered the issue’ of his cleaner’s immigration status, and 
concluded that he had performed sufficient checks, he wrote in his 
resignation letter.

After 
his promotion to Immigration Minister in September 2012, Mr Harper said,
 he ‘went through a similar consideration process’ and decided against 
carrying out any further checks.    

Given
 the obvious sensitivity of his new position, Mr Harper said he now 
accepted that he ‘should have checked more thoroughly’.

He
 told Mr Cameron that he only became aware of his cleaner’s illegal 
status after he began piloting the Immigration Bill through Parliament 
and became acutely aware of the need for employers to carry out 
‘reasonable checks’ on the status of their employees.

Even
 though ‘we do not require them to be experts or spot anything other 
than an obvious forgery’, he told Mr Cameron that he ‘thought it prudent
 to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner’.

The
 unidentified Colombian woman provided new copies of the documents on 
Tuesday. But when Mr Harper asked his private office to check the 
details with immigration officials, he was told that she did not have 
indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron both praised Mr Harper's contribution to Government

‘Although
 I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as Immigration 
Minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will 
toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher 
standard than expected of others,’ he said in a letter to the PM.

In
 his response, Mr Cameron wrote: ‘I am very sorry indeed to see you 
leave the Government, but I understand your reasons for doing so. I hope
 very much that you will be able to return to service on the Frontbench 
before too long.’

Clean-cut Mr Harper, a prominent Eurosceptic, has been tipped for swift advancement since entering the Government. 

He
 caused controversy last year when he rounded on a five times-failed 
asylum seeker live on TV and demanded he go home, saying: ‘We don’t 
believe you and neither did the judge,’ going on to say: ‘With the 
greatest respect, when you were here claiming asylum, taxpayers 
supported you. You now have no right to be in the United Kingdom and you
 should return.’

He faced 
anger for defending the controversial vans that toured London bearing 
posters with the warning to illegal immigrants: ‘Go home or face 
arrest.’

Mr Harper insisted he had done nothing illegal but that he 'had fallen below the standards expected of him'. He apologised to the Prime Minister for any 'embarrassment' caused

Mr Harper's resignation sees a cabinet reshuffle in which junior Home Office minister James Brokenshire becomes Minister of State, while Karen Bradley moves 
from the whips office to fill his role.

John Penrose is promoted 
within the whips office to replace Ms Bradley and Harriet Baldwin is 
brought into the Government ranks as a junior whip.

In response to the shake-up, Theresa May said: 'James Brokenshire's well-deserved promotion is a testament to the ability and diligence he has shown in the Home Office since 2010.

'I also want to welcome Karen Bradley to the department. She has demonstrated great promise since her election and I look forward to working with her.'

Labour’s shadow 
Immigration Minister, David Hanson, described Mr Harper as ‘decent’ for 
stepping down but added: ‘Perhaps once again the Government need to 
think very carefully about how they approach this issue as it is clear 
there are limits to the effectiveness of relying on employer and 
landlord checks to address illegal immigration.’

Taxpayers
 paid thousands of pounds for the services of Mr Harper’s cleaner. In 
2007-08, he claimed £946 on his parliamentary expenses for cleaning and 
ironing, with the bill rising to £1,262 the following year. He submitted
 dozens of printed receipts for weekly cleaning bills, which totalled 
£30 a week for three hours’ worth of work.

Last
 night it was unclear whether the ex-Minister would have to pay a fine. 
Whitehall sources insist he would avoid one because his cleaner was 
self-employed. But legal experts say this is not an automatic defence. 
Under Section 15 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, 
employers are liable for civil penalties of up to £10,000 if they do not
 ‘verify, retain, copy or record the content’ of a worker’s documents.

In
 2009, Labour’s Attorney General Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 for 
employing a Tongan housekeeper who was in the UK illegally – because she
 failed to keep copies of her papers.

New
 Assistant Whip Harriett Baldwin was educated at £31,000-a-year 
Marlborough College, the Wiltshire school attended by Kate Middleton. 
She spent two decades at investment bank JP Morgan Chase, before winning
 the safe Tory seat of Worcestershire West in 2010.

Another
 beneficiary of the reshuffle is comprehensive-educated Tory Karen 
Bradley, who becomes a junior Minister at the Home Office.

In
 April 2007 I took on a cleaner for my London flat.

In doing so, I was 
very mindful of my legal and financial obligations and undertook a 
number of checks beforehand. This included consideration of the HMRC 
tests as to whether the cleaner was performing her work under a contract
 for services on a self-employed basis which I concluded she was.  

However,
 even though there was no legal requirement for me to check her right to
 work in the UK, I felt that it was appropriate to do so.  

I
 therefore took a copy of her passport to verify her identity and also a
 copy of a Home Office letter, dated 26 January 2006, which stated that 
she had leave to remain indefinitely in the United Kingdom, including 
the right to work and engage in a business.

I
 considered the issue again when you appointed me as a Minister in the 
Cabinet Office in May 2010 and concluded that as I had performed a right
 to work check in 2007 and that my cleaner had indefinite leave to 
remain in the UK no further check was necessary. 

When
 you then appointed me as Immigration Minister in September 2012 I went 
through a similar consideration process and once again concluded that no
 further check was necessary.  In retrospect, I should have checked more
 thoroughly.

As I took 
the Immigration Bill through Parliament in autumn 2013 I talked a lot 
about these matters in the context both of employers and landlords. What
 we do, and will, require of both is that they carry out reasonable 
checks and take copies of documents. 

We
 do not require them to be experts or spot anything other than an 
obvious forgery. Given this focus on these matters, I thought it prudent
 to check that all my documents were in order for my cleaner. I 
undertook an extensive search to locate the copies of documents I had 
taken but unfortunately I was unable to locate them.

As
 a result, in the week commencing 20 January 2014 I asked my cleaner for
 further copies of these documents which she provided on 4 February.

On
 5 February, I asked my private office to check the details with 
immigration officials to confirm that all was in order.

I was informed 
on the morning of 6 February that my cleaner did not in fact have 
indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. I immediately notified
 the Home Secretary and my Permanent Secretary. This is now a matter 
for Immigration Enforcement.

Although
 I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as Immigration 
Minister, who is taking legislation through Parliament which will 
toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher 
standard than expected of others.

I have also considered the impact on 
my Parliamentary colleagues, the Government and you. I have always 
believed that politics is a team game, not an individual sport. Under 
the circumstances, I have therefore decided that the right course is for
 me to return to the Backbenches. I am sorry for any embarrassment 
caused.

I am grateful 
for the opportunities you have given me since you became Leader of the 
Conservative Party, first in Opposition and then in Government.

I will 
continue to support you as Prime Minister, the Conservative Party and 
this Government in whatever way I can from the backbenches. I will also 
continue to serve my constituents in the Forest of Dean to the best of 
my ability.
