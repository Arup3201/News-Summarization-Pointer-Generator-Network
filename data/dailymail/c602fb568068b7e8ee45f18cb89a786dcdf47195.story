On the pitch, there are few players in the world that excite as much as Barcelona forward Neymar Jnr but when it comes to showcasing his musical talents, he leaves plenty to be desired.

The 22-year-old shared a video on his Instagram feed on Friday of him and three of his pals belting out a Brazilian love song in a car.

Neymar certainly looks every bit a pop star with his cap turned backwards, his black shades and a diamond stud in his ear.

The Barcelona forward has enjoyed a rich vein of goalscoring form for club and country this season

But the Brazil international struggles to make an impression vocally, which is less than can be said for his goalscoring exploits this year.

Neymar has already netted 13 times for Barcelona this season and has scored an impressive 15 goals for Brazil in 2014 in just 13 appearances.

It is the sort of form that led to Brazilian legend Ronaldo this week claiming that his compatriot should be considered one of the world's best players.

'Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are the best right now, but Neymar has come a long way. The move to Europe has done him good,' the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan striker said.
