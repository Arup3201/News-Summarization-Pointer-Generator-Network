The European football season's annual curtain-raiser takes place on Tuesday night when Real Madrid meet Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff.

Though a friendly in all but name, it is a chance for the two sides to lay down a marker ahead of the new campaign.

Here's all you need to know about the Super Cup showdown in the Welsh capital.

What is the Super Cup?

The annual match is organised by UEFA as a sort of starting pistol for the new European season and is between the winners of the previous season's Champions League and Europa League.

So on this occasion, it's Real Madrid, who beat their city rivals Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon back in May, taking on Sevilla, who defeated Benfica on penalties in Turin.

Where is this all-Spanish showdown taking place?

In Cardiff... obviously. This year's Super Cup will be held at the 33,000-capacity Cardiff City Stadium, which is, as you might have guessed, the home of Championship side Cardiff City. It is also the venue for most Wales football internationals.

Hang on, isn't this match usually played in Monaco?

It was, yes, at the Stade Louis II between 1998 and 2012. But UEFA decided to take the competition on the road and, rather like the finals of the Champions League and the Europa League, it will have a different host city each year. 

Last year, the venue was the Eden Arena in Prague as Bayern Munich beat Chelsea on penalties after a 2-2 draw. And next year it's heading to Tbilisi, Georgia.

I remember the match being later in August - has it moved?

It has moved, about two weeks forward in the calendar.

It was on August 30 last season and was usually held on the last Friday in the month alongside the group stage draws for the European competitions, but with FIFA deciding to abolish the August international friendlies, it made sense to bring it forward to the empty slot. 

The problem with holding it on a Friday night at the end of August was that the domestic leagues have usually started and the two participants had to re-arrange a league game to make room. The move alleviates this concern.

Is there much interest in the match?

Well, according to the front cover of Monday's AS newspaper, 8,000 Spanish fans are heading over to Cardiff. 

There does seem to be plenty of local interest as well, with the Cardiff City website saying over the weekend that only a limited number of restricted view tickets were available. Tickets have sold well despite pretty expensive price categories of £110, £75 and £40.

I can't get to Cardiff... is it on the TV?

Yes. You have a choice of watching it on ITV4 (coverage starts at 7.30pm for a 7.45pm kick-off) or the newly-launched Sky Sports 5.

Who's the man in the middle?

England's Mark Clattenburg is set to take charge. It will be the first match in a UEFA club competition to use the vanishing spray that proved so popular at the World Cup.

Have the teams played in the Super Cup before?

They have. Real lifted the trophy in 2002, when they beat UEFA Cup holders Feyenoord 3-1 in Monaco. They have also lost two finals, to Cup Winners' Cup holders Chelsea in 1998 and Galatasaray in 2000. 

Sevilla beat Barcelona 3-0 to win the Super Cup in 2006 but they lost 3-1 to Milan on their return visit the following year.

What are they playing for?

The Super Cup trophy has had various guises over the years and the latest silver one looks pretty sleek and modern. It is 58cm high and weights in at 12.2kg. Sevilla's Javi Navarro was the first to lift the new version back in August 2006. 

The trophy has been sight-seeing this last week along with its siblings the European Cup and the Europa League trophy - they were all carried up to the summit of Snowdon by two die-hard football fans. They have also been on display in Bangor, Aberystwyth, Llanelli and Cardiff on the roadshow.

Who's in charge?

Carlo Ancelotti joined Bob Paisley in football posterity when he won his third European Cup back in May, the success in Lisbon added to two triumphs when at Milan.

He had arrived at the Bernabeu from Paris Saint-Germain the previous summer and, although they couldn't keep up with neighbours Atletico in the league, they exacted their revenge in the European final.

Real also won the Copa del Rey, beating Barcelona thanks to Bale's sensational solo goal, to endear Ancelotti even more to the fans.

Quick success: Unai Emery has guided Sevilla to fifth in La Liga and Europa League glory

Unai Emery replaced Michel at the helm in January 2013 and led Sevilla to a fifth place finish in his first full season as well as the Europa League.

It is the third time Sevilla have won the competition, all of those coming in the last eight years.

Who's going to be on display?

The fans in Cardiff will be among the first to see Real's latest crop of Galacticos in action. 

With £70m Colombian sensation James Rodriguez and £20m German midfield master Toni Kroos joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, Real will undoubtedly have the most feared forward line in Europe in the coming season.

Homecoming: Gareth Bale is set to play for Real Madrid in his home city of Cardiff 

It is a homecoming for Bale, who scored in the Champions League final, as he was brought up in the city, attended Whitchurch High School and started out with Cardiff Civil Service FC. 

Sevilla's team will be worth a fraction of Real's, and they sold Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic to Barcelona in June, but they could still trouble their more illustrious opponents.

To mark the launch of their new European football channel, Sky Sports have unleashed a giant football at the Cardiff City Stadium.

Sky Sports 5, which starts broadcasting on Tuesday just in time for the UEFA Super Cup between Real Madrid and Sevilla, will show up to 600 live fixtures from the Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey, Coppa Italia, Eredivisie and Euro 2016 qualifiers.

The inflatable ball measures 13.71m (45ft) in diameter and is 65 times the size of a regular ball.

Transfer business this summer

Apart from the aforementioned Rodriguez and Kroos, Real have also added Costa Rica's goalkeeper from the World Cup, Keylor Navas, who has joined from Levante for £9m. 

They have waved goodbye to striker Alvaro Morata, who was looking increasingly surplus to requirements, and joined Juventus for £17m. Real have the option to buy the 21-year-old back if he develops well in the future.

Sevilla have been quite busy in the market. Rakitic is the biggest departure, moving to Barcelona for £15m. Incoming are defensive midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Reims, winger Aleix Vidal from Almeria, centre-back Nicolas Pareja from Spartak Moscow and Reading centre-back Daniel Carrico.

Who's going to win?

Real will be the heavy favourites. They are tipped for a free-scoring and successful campaign given their firepower up front and will want to stamp their authority here, as well as picking up another trophy for their ever-growing collection. 

Any links between Wales and Spain?

Yes, right down to the Welsh DNA. Professor John Koch has suggested that the Welsh can trace their ancestry back to Spain and Portugal. 

His research of archaeological inscriptions offers evidence that the Celts were settled in Iberia before migrating northwards. 

There is, of course, also a lineage of footballers from Wales who have played in Spain. Bale aside, Wrexham's Mark Hughes played for Barcelona in 1986-1987 after moving from Manchester United.

Spanish success: John Toshack pictured during his second spell at Real Madrid

John Toshack managed Real Madrid in two spells, Real Sociedad in three and also Deportivo La Coruna and Real Murcia. Tosh won Madrid their fifth consecutive league title in 1989-1990, breaking both the points and goals records.

Know where I can get some Spanish food in Cardiff?

La Cha Cha is a tapas and wine bar on Mermaid Quay and offers traditional Spanish dishes and fine wines. La Cuina on Kings Road is inspired by Catalan cuisine and also has a deli. Demiro's, opposite the Milennium Centre in Cardiff Bay, offers dishes from right across the Mediterranean. There's also a branch of La Tasca, the tapas restaurant, in the Old Brewery Quarter.
