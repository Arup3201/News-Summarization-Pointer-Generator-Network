Brittany Killgore was kidnapped and held against her will and then murdered during violent bondage sex games planned by a man she had turned to for help moving back home to her parents, prosecutors alleged on Wednesday.

Authorities say the 22-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine, whose naked, mutilated body was found in an ditch in April in San Diego, California, was an 'unwilling participant' in the sadomasochistic torture committed by Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and Jessica Lynn Lopez -- all of whom were in a master-slave sex ring.

Court documents unsealed on Wednesday reveal that police seized whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document titled 'Slave Rules,' duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage instruments from the house the three suspects shared. Investigators found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items.

Previous media accounts have suggested Mrs Killgore might have somehow been involved in the bondage fetishes of Perez, Maraglino and Lopez. However, prosecutors now say she was tricked into getting into a car with Perez an then abducted, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. 

'Based on my training, experience and investigation, I believe that Perez, Maraglino and Lopez were involved in sexual behavior which included bondage, torture, and master, servant and slave role playing,' court documents say.

Three days before her murder, Mrs Killgore had filed for divorce from U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Cory Killgore, who was deployed to Afghanistan.

The couple moved from their hometown in rural Missouri to San Diego when Corporal Killgore was stationed at nearby Camp Pendleton.

Prosecutors say she had packed up her belonging was was preparing to move out of state when Perez, 46, came to her door on April 13 and asked her to go on a dinner cruise with him, the Union-Tribune reported.

Newly unsealed documents listed numerous bondage objects seized as evidence from the house of Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and  Jessica Lynn Lopez.

A partial list follows:,

She had met Perez, who is a Marine Staff Sargent, previously when she accompanied her friend to his house to pick up something she had bought online.

Killgore turned down Perez's offer. However, later in the day, she sent him a text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move.

'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' he replied.

She agreed. Perez went to her apartment and picked her up -- promising him a night out with her and Maraglino on a dinner cruise.

She never made it to the cruise. Just 13 minutes into the car ride, she sent a friend a desperate text message: 'Help.'

Prosecutors say Perez then turned off her phone.

Authorities believe Killgore was taken to Perez's house, where he summoned Maraglino and Lopez to participate in bondage torture.

Following the torture, she was strangled to death and her naked body dumped in a ditch, where she was found four days later.

Previously, Perez had bragged on an online bondage group that same day Killgore disappeared that he was he was planning to have a bondage session that weekend. 

Police seized a host of bondage equipment from Perez's house during a search. 

The included: nylon rope with hairs on it, and open container of latex gloves. Rope/pulley system in plastic bag, two saws, a stun gun, a baton and several rolls of tape.
