A bogus lawyer who was ordered to pay £1.4million in legal costs after being exposed by the Daily Mail and then struck off has been ordered to pay a further massive sum after abandoning an appeal.

Shahrokh Mireskandari, 53, has been given until April 4 to pay more than £230,000 in additional costs after being condemned by a leading judge for 'wholly abusive, unreasonable and manipulative conduct', including attempting to get the appeal hearing adjourned.

Mireskandari was banned from practising as a solicitor after an investigation by the Mail revealed that he had faked his legal qualifications and hid criminal convictions while representing celebrity clients.

A solicitors' disciplinary tribunal found him guilty in June 2012 of 104 breaches of the rules governing solicitors' conduct after a six-week hearing.

The Mail uncovered the scandal

The tribunal found that while running his London-based law firm Dean and Dean, Mireskandari got into debt, overcharged clients, conducted improper litigation, failed to keep proper records and used clients' cash to pay staff salaries.

The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) accused him of making 'substantial efforts to derail and disrupt' the hearing.

Then Mireskandari, who owned a string of properties in London but has fled to Los Angeles to avoid creditors, launched an appeal against the strike-off order and it was listed for a 10-day hearing in February.

But less than a fortnight before it was due to begin he applied for it to be stayed on the grounds of ill health.

The application was rejected as 'hopeless' by Lord Justice Moses on February 5, who also described it as 'an abusive application designed to manipulate the court into granting an adjournment'. Later the same week Mireskandari withdrew his appeal.

Yesterday, the SRA asked Lord Justice Moses to make a costs order against Mireskandari on an indemnity basis - the highest level available - to show the court's disapproval of his unreasonable conduct, which had led to the authority incurring substantial costs in preparing to resist his 43 grounds of appeal.

Agreeing, Lord Justice Moses said: 'If this conduct and litigation does not justify an order I don't know what litigation does.'

Formally dismissing Mireskandari's appeal, the Appeal Court judge said: 'This has been wholly abusive and unreasonable litigation.'

Disciplinary action was taken against Mireskandari after the Mail revealed in 2008 he had launched his legal career in the UK on the basis of qualifications acquired from a mail drop Hawaii university.

At the time he was representing ex-Met assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur in his race claim against Britain's biggest force and former commissioner, Sir Ian Blair.

He was also in close contact with Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, who publicly described him as a 'very, very dear friend' and also as the 'best lawyer in Britain'.

In the aftermath of the Mail investigation, Mireskandari faced disciplinary action, his firm was closed down, his close friend the corrupt Met commander Ali Dizaei was suspended and Mr Ghaffur had to drop his £1million-plus race claim.

Mireskandari was represented by 17 barristers at the misconduct hearing, but panel chairman Jacqueline Devonish said that allegations of dishonesty had been proved.

The Iranian-born crook claimed he was the victim of a racially motivated vendetta by the SRA and the Mail. But the tribunal dismissed this.
