A thug has been jailed for seven years after he stabbed his girlfriend and one of her school friends to impress his mates.

Wesley Harvie, 25, left Tami Hickey with a 6in deep stab wound when he plunged a kitchen knife into her abdomen following a petty drunken tiff.

When old school friend Dean Maundrell leapt in to try to protect her, the yob thrust the knife right through his arm and then stabbed him in the chest.

Swindon Justice Centre, which incorporates the Crown court, where Wesley Harvie, 25, appeared accused of stabbing his girlfriend and one of her school friends

Jailing him at Swindon Crown Court, Recorder David Bartlett said: 'Both of the men said don't use the knives but you did use them in what is said was a show a bravado.'

The pair were drinking with friends at their home in Park North, Swindon, on April 21 when they had an argument.

Miss Hickey went to the kitchen to see two friends but was followed by Harvie.

Hannah Squire, prosecuting, said: 'He took two large knives from the knife block and grabbed her by the neck said "I'm going to kill you, and thrust one of the knives into her abdomen".'

Incredibly, the huge knife missed her vital organs.

Mark Ashley, defending, said his client felt he was being provoked by the others who were saying he wouldnâ€™t do anything.

He said neither victim wanted to give evidence against him and Miss Hickey was standing by him.

Harvie - who was on early prison release for threatening to shoot a man at the time of the attack - admitted two counts of wounding with intent.
