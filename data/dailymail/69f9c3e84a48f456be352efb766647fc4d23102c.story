New Zealand completed a series whitewash against Sri Lanka with what ultimately proved to be a comfortable 193-run win in the second Test at Wellington.

Kane Williamson and BJ Watling had laid the foundations for a declaration on day four with a record unbeaten 365 and Sri Lanka came into the final day needing 345 to draw the series with the home side requiring another nine wickets.

And the Black Caps got them before tea with Mark Craig recording figures of four for 53 while Lahiru Thirimanne's unbeaten 62 supplied the only real resistance.

The tourists got off to a terrible start as nightwatchman Dhammika Prasad exited to just the 10th ball of the morning.

Trent Boult found a thick edge outside the off-stump and James Neesham was on hand to see off Prasad for six at second slip.

The next wicket was to be the key however and it was Boult again who dismissed Sri Lankan talisman Kumar Sangakkara in controversial fashion.

The left-hander swung at one outside off and although the finger did not go up, Brendon McCullum reviewed and Sangakkara, who had registered 203 in the first innings, was forced to depart for five with Watling gathering behind the stumps.

Thirimanne joined Kaushal Silva at the crease and the opener got to his 50 in 119 balls but was gone just two later without adding to it, edging Doug Bracewell to Craig at second slip.

Williamson had been the hero on day four as he accumulated 242 not out and he played a crucial role again in claiming a stunning catch to remove Angelo Mathews (eight) before lunch.

The captain edged Bracewell to gully and Williamson leapt to his left to get a hand the ball and he caught it at the second attempt to send the tourists into the break at 110 for five.

Prasanna Jayawardene dug in with Thirimanne but the scoring was predictably slow before the wcketkeeper slapped a loose one from Craig to Williamson at cover for 10.

Sri Lanka were staring down the barrel now and two wickets in two balls from Craig saw them slip to 156 for eight.

First Dinesh Chandimal (13) got a faint edge behind to Watling and then Rangana Herath followed lbw, although Suranga Lakmal survived the hat-trick ball.

Lakmal was next to go though as he was run out for six and victory was assured when Tim Southee left Nuwan Pradeep's (one) stumps in a mess.
