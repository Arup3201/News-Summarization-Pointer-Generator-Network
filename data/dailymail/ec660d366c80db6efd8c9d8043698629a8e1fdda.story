Christian Benteke is a doubt for Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifiers against Cyprus and Israel after limping out of Aston Villa's defeat to Swansea with a hip problem.

The injury appears to be a recurrence of the one that kept Benteke out of the FA Cup victory over West Bromwich Albion.

He took a tablet painkiller in the second-half after needing treatment following a fall and was replaced by Andi Weimann with 15 minutes left.

Tim Sherwood was unable to clarify how severe the injury might prove, with assessment taking place after the final whistle.

The Villa manager was also concerned that Tom Cleverley was forced off after 25 minutes with an apparent groin problem. He already has an injury list that includes Ron Vlaar, Philippe Senderos, Nathan Baker, Kieran Richardson, Aly Cissokho, Matt Lowton, and Libor Kozak.

On Benteke, Sherwood said: 'He's had a problem with his hip. In the end he had to come off because it was too sore to continue. I don't know how bad it is, he's being assessed now by the physios. It's a concern.

'But we've got two fit defenders in the whole club. Hopefully this two-week international break lets the phsyios work some magic.'
