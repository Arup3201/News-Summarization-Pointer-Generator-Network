The North Pole is out of police jurisdiction and two boys from Wisconsin learned this lesson the hard way after calling 911 in the hopes of connecting with Santa Claus.

Brothers Blake, 6, and Brody, 3, were watching television with their parents Jennifer and Shawn Blake when Brody grabbed hold of his father's cell phone and dialed 911 on November 23.

'They were just sitting there, just talking and stuff and all of a sudden Blake said, "Brody, let’s call Santa,"' Jennifer Becker told ABC NEWS.

Santa's good list: Brody, 3, and Blake, 6, called 911 on November 23 because they wanted to talk to Santa

'Well, Brody ended up hitting the emergency call button on the cell phone and it dialed 911.'

The Becker’s had no idea that the children called 911 until the dispatch called the cell phone to check and see if everything was ok.

Jennifer Becker apologized to the police and told them that nothing was wrong but nonetheless the Becker’s heard a knock on their door minutes later, reports Fox.

When they opened the front door it was a police officer who explained to the boys hoping to get on Santa's good list, the proper use of 911.

'The kids, they looked scared and I don’t know if it was because they thought it was, like, Santa Claus, but when we opened it, it was a police officer,' she said.

The officer from the Mayville Police Department who responded to the call explained to the boys that 911 are just for emergencies.

'The children were counselled as far as the proper use of 911 and they were told that the best way to contact Santa Claus was in person,' Mayville Police Chief Christopher MacNeill told ABC News.

The cops also gave the boys a tour of the police station on Wednesday and got a bit of a laugh out of the whole situation.

'I kind of chuckled a little bit,' he said, describing his reaction to the call.

'It’s good to know that there was no emergency but to hear that, you know, the two kids wanted to call Santa Claus, you know, was kind of humorous. But what we said is, basically, that the North Pole is out of our jurisdiction.'

Becker says she's to blame for the kids attempting to call Santa because she told them about an actual Santa Hotline that plays a recording of Santa’s voice.

Callers are told they may leave a message with Santa to tell them their Christmas list.

'Brody was asking for trucks and big cars, and Blake, he wants a bow and arrow, truck, a four-wheeler combine,' Becker said. 

Santa will be visiting the boys at their school Tomorrow, reports TMJ.
