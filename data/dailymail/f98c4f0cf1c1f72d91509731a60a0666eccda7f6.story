Mischief managed: Parents of children displaying antisocial-behaviour are to be taught how to calm them down

Parents of children displaying anti-social behaviour are to be told to take lessons in how to manage them.

They will be taught how to avoid ‘inflaming the situation’ when their child flies off the handle under guidance drawn  up to deal with thousands of children diagnosed with conduct disorders.

The problem is estimated to affect one child in 20 aged five to 16, with each costing £70,000 to educational and other services.

The main recommendation, from the healthcare body Nice, is for group training programmes to be offered to the parents of children as young as three who have a conduct disorder or are at risk of developing one.

They will act out situations involving ‘challenging’ behaviour and be taught how to stop saying ‘no’ to children.

Experts say that saying merely ‘no’ triggers further misbehaviour. Instead parents will learn to ignore bad actions and reward the child for good behaviour.

The guidance comes from the healthcare body NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence).

Professor Peter Fonagy, a member of the guideline group and Professor of Psychoanalysis at University College London (UCL), said the advice did not mean parents were being misled by ‘Supernanny’ and other gurus who advocate discipline and strict boundaries for children.

He said ‘All children can be naughty, defiant and impulsive from time to time, which is perfectly normal.

‘However, some children have extremely difficult and challenging behaviours that are outside the norm for their age.’

He said children diagnosed with a conduct disorder need to be managed in a counter-intuitive way. ‘Parents are taught how to say yes.

‘They learn how to ignore negative behaviour and focus on the positive because the attention that normally follows from being told not to do something leads to more negative behaviour.

‘It’s logical to say don’t do that’ he said. ‘These are not bad parents but a punitive approach makes things worse’ he added.

He said these children differ from occasionally naughty children by being persistently defiant in a range of situations.

Professor Stephen Pilling, director of the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, UCL and facilitator of the guideline group, said: 'Conduct disorder has real consequences for the child and their families, schooling is disrupted, family life can become very stressful and problems with drug and alcohol misuse and the criminal justice system are common.

‘But the problems associated with conduct disorder are often lifelong; with adults who had a conduct disorder during their childhood being far more likely to develop another mental health disorder when they are an adult - nearly half go on to develop antisocial personality disorder.

‘The costs to individuals, families and society of untreated conduct disorder are enormous.’

He said many parents would welcome help, which should be coordinated by GPs, teachers and social workers.

‘Parent training programmes provide them with strategies for dealing with difficult children and how to better handle them going forward’ he added.

Figures suggest adults who had a conduct disorder or conduct problems in childhood are responsible for 80 per cent of crime. It is estimated that the costs of services to individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder at the age of 10 over a period of about 18 years is estimated at £70,000.

The estimated costs of group or individual parent training is £1,600-£3,000, while intensive family training may cost £15,000, say Nice.
