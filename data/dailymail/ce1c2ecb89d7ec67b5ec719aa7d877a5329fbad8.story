Shock: Jamie Skinner collapsed during the Under-14s game in Edinburgh and could not be revived

Tributes have been made to two promising teenage footballers who died yesterday within hours of each other.

Jamie Skinner, 13, died in front of his father and brother after collapsing during and Under-14s match in Edinburgh.

He was attempting to head the ball while 
playing for Tynecastle FC against Spartans FC when he collapsed on the 
Saughton Astro pitch in the city.

His death came just hours after 18-year-old David Paul, who was on the verge of breaking into Hibernian FC's first team, died suddenly in his sleep at his family home in Edinburgh.

Police Scotland said that initial inquiries suggested there were 'no suspicious circumstances'.

Tributes have flooded in for the talented boys from their clubs and friends, and professional football players.

Eyewitnesses said Jamie had appeared to be fit and healthy - but then fell unconscious to the ground and ‘never woke up.’

There was speculation last night that Jamie - described as a ‘wonderful human being’ by teachers at his school - may have died from heart failure, but this was not confirmed by police or club bosses.

The club said his death followed an ‘innocuous event’, as he jumped to head the ball, and that his family were ‘devastated’ and had been ‘ripped apart’ by Jamie’s sudden death.

A statement released by the club, which is not officially linked with Hearts FC, said Jamie had been ‘playing the game he loved’ and ‘lost his life on the pitch.’

It added: ‘In an innocuous event during the game Jamie collapsed and despite the valiant attempts of everyone at the game, and the ambulance service, attempts to revive him were sadly in vain.

‘Although Jamie was new to our Tynecastle family, he had up until recently been playing for Hearts. He was a prospect that undoubtedly would have had a bright future in the game.

‘No words can fully express our grief and dismay at seeing this happen.

‘We can only pass on all our thoughts and prayers to friends and family and hope they will get some strength from the outpouring of love and support from everyone.

‘Everyone at Tynecastle is in total shock at what has happened, and we are sure the youth football community will join with us in also thinking of all the players, coaches and supporters at the game who witnessed this sad event, and the club also thanks everyone who tried to assist.

‘As a mark of respect all Tynecastle teams will hold a minute’s silence before their next game.’

The
 club posted on Twitter: ‘No words can express the grief and dismay we 
feel following the sudden death of Under-14s player Jamie Skinner, we 
thank all your support.’

David Paul's devastated father Gordon 
yesterday thanked those who had contacted the family to express their 
condolences and offer support and asked for privacy.

Support: The manager of Jamie's club, Tyneside FC, paid tribute to the 13-year-old who had a 'bright future'

It is understood that the news was immediately passed to Hibs manager Terry Butcher, who has only recently taken over the Edinburgh side.

A spokesman for Hibs said: 'It is with great sorrow that Hibernian FC today confirms the sad death of youth player David Paul.

'David, who could play in midfield or in attack, passed away in the early hours of today at his home in Edinburgh.'

Hibs
 chairman Rod Petrie said: 'Everyone at the club is deeply affected by 
this.

'David was a talented and promising young footballer, and a fine 
young man.

'Our thoughts - and the thoughts of the entire Hibernian 
community - are with his family at this dreadful and difficult time for 
them.'

Last night Tynecastle Football Club vice-chairman Simon Kinghorn said Jamie collapsed just before noon yesterday, early in the second half.

Jamie had only just joined Tynecastle from Hearts FC and that both his father and brother were watching the match on the touchline, Mr Kinghorn said.

He added: ‘I’ve spoken to the family who are devastated, obviously. They are trying to come to terms with this awful news and these tragic circumstances. We as a club will do anything we can to support them.

‘They are just besides themselves at the moment.

‘For this to happen at any time would be tragic but three days before Christmas it’s just absolutely terrible.

‘It’s a time when families are getting together and this one has just been ripped apart.’

Mr Kinghorn said: ‘Trained medical staff both at the ground and the hospital did all they could to save Jamie but were unable to revive him.’

The match was called off after the tragedy and as a mark of respect several other matches across the city were also postponed yesterday.

An eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The young lad took unwell whilst playing football on the 3G at Saughton.

‘He was fine one minute and then he just collapsed and never woke up.

‘When he took unwell people at the 
game started pumping his chest but he never woke. The ambulance crews 
took over but he never made it.’

Scottish football clubs expressed their sorrow and team-mates of the young players left tributes on Facebook and Twitter.

Jamie's friend Russell Cairns wrote: 'It was a pleasure to play alongside him at Hearts he was a legend, RIP my friend.'

Professional football players and sports stars expressed their shock at the deaths.

Scotland international Charlie Adam wrote on Twitter: 'Thoughts go out to the family of Jamie Skinner who sadly died playing football today... He was playing for hearts v Dundee. RIP.'

Former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler added: 'Terrible news about the 2 young players in Scotland. RIP Jamie Skinner, RIP David Paul.'

As a mark of respect, all Tynecastle teams will hold a minute's silence before their next game.

Scottish tennis player Jamie Murray wrote on Twitter: 'RIP David Paul and Jamie Skinner. Both terrible tragedies. Life doesn't make sense sometimes.'

Mark Wotte, the Scottish Football Association's performance director, works with many young footballers across the country.

He said: 'Very sad news and devastated to hear young Jamie Skinner has passed away on the football pitch, my thoughts are with his family and Hearts FC.

'Can't believe another young player passed away in his sleep today. RIP David Paul. My thoughts are with his family and Hibernian FC.'

Jamie's school, Liberton High School, tweeted last night: ‘Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Jamie Skinner at this tragic time. He was a wonderful human being. RIP Jamie.’

On their Twitter account, Youth Football Scotland tweeted: ‘Our thoughts & prayers go out to family and friends of Tynecastle U14s player Jamie Skinner, who tragically passed away today.’

Stoke City and Scotland international Charlie Adam wrote: ‘Thoughts go out to the family of Jamie Skinner who sadly died playing football today @ the age of 14.’

Police Scotland confirmed a 13-year-old boy had collapsed on the pitch and was taken to hospital where he died.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out.
