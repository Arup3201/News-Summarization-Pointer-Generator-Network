Ally McCoist has sought clarity over the role of a chief football operations officer at Ibrox – amid concerns his plea for a new chief scout is falling on deaf ears.

Sportsmail revealed last month that Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace had met former Ibrox midfielder Christian Nerlinger about the possibility of returning to the club in the CFOO position created in his 120-day review.

McCoist has stated he would have no issue with the move – provided he was guaranteed final say over player recruitment. But he remains in the dark as to whether someone like Nerlinger would effectively be the club’s eyes and ears on potential transfers at home and abroad.

Were that not to be the case, McCoist believes the lack of a chief scout will seriously hinder the club’s prospects of building for the future.

‘I spoke with Graham half an hour ago and nothing has been said about Nerlinger or any director of football so I don’t know anything about it,’ he said. ‘I would expect to know something but it’s gone quiet.

‘My priority is to win the league but in terms of the infrastructure, we desperately need a chief scout.

‘Finance plays a big part in why we can’t plan longer term.

‘You lose 20 players valued at £40million and you replace them with free transfers. It is not rocket science and not a criticism of the boys you are bringing in. It is a fact of life.

‘We have to replace quality and get quality back in to get back to that level we want to be at. You are not going to do that in a year. It is proven. 

‘We had a team to win the Third Division and a team last year and we have a team this year. We just have to keep strengthening. 

‘The one thing you do have with a chief scout and a scouting department is you have the potential to do a Sporting Lisbon (with Ryan Gauld). 

‘Go and get a boy at 18, 19 and say: “Right, it looks like we are not going to play you for 18 months, but we are going to develop you.” That is the ideal world.

‘We are light years away from that yet. We need to get back to having a base where we have people at games, going to Europe to watch under-18 and under-21 tournaments.

‘Whether that is the chief football officer’s gig or the chief scout’s gig is up for debate. But if we want to get back to a top standard in Scotland and hopefully get back into European football, we have to have people assessing players.’

Summer signings Darren McGregor, Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd have provided ammunition for critics who believe McCoist’s line of vision is too narrow.

While content with those acquisitions, he feels the lack of a proper scouting network means recruiting potential hidden gems from untapped markets is currently impossible.

‘Durranty, Kenny (McDowall) and myself watch French and Dutch football, absolutely everything. But we can’t go and watch players unless they are in Scotland because of the situation the club is in. 

‘That is the beauty of having a scouting department. At this moment in time you are actually just watching games off videos. You are getting players sent to you from agents, which is great and we follow it up, but it is not ideal.’
