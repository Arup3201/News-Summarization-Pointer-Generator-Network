A fifth Vanderbilt football player and two other men have been arrested following the rape of a 21-year-old female student in a dorm last June.

The three suspects are being indicted for their actions after the rape, and will not face sex crimes charges.  Four other football players were indicted earlier this month for raping a student and taping the assault.

Wide receiver Chris Boyd, 21, is being charged with accessory after the fact.

The Roswell, Georgia native is being accused of giving the suspects advice on how to cover up the sexual assault. 

Boyd was expected to surrender himself to police. Since the indictment, he has been suspended from the team.

Beth Fortune, the university's Vice Chancellor for Public Affairs issued a statement following the fifth indictment.

She said that all of the allegations are 'deeply troubling' and that the university is taking them very seriously.

'Pursuant to the athletic department conduct policy, Mr Boyd has been suspended from the football team, pending further review,' Ms Fortune said.

Two other men, acquaintances of Brandon Vandenburg, one of the players charged with rape, were arrested yesterday in Riverside County, California. 

Miles Joseph Finley, 19, and Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, are being charged with tampering with evidence.

Initially Finley tried to flea when he saw authorities arrive at his house, but he was quickly apprehended.

The two are being held as fugitives wanted by the State of Tennessee and will be extradited to the to face trial.

Nashville Chief of Police Steve Anderson stated that the new indictments were reflective of hundreds of law enforcement hours spent on the case.

He reiterated that the investigation remains open and active.

'We are looking at all persons who may have been involved in this event, before, during and after the fact. Additional charges cannot be ruled out,' he said.

The arrests yesterday come after the four players suspected of carrying out the rape were arrested indicted earlier this month.

Safety Cory Batey, 19 of Nashville, Tennessee; defensive back Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; receiver Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi; and tight end Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California were charged with two counts of aggravated sexual battery for an incident tipped to campus officials by surveillance video.

Vandenburg also is charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography.

Vanderbilt dismissed the players June 29 and barred them from the campus pending the investigation. At the time, Ms Fortune said that their first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and that the university will continue to offer her all of its services and support.

'We are shocked and saddened by the allegations that such an assault has taken place on our campus and that they include members of our football team,' she said in a statement.

'The charges brought today against the four former Vanderbilt football players allege conduct which is abhorrent and will never be tolerated. We will review our athletics program to be sure that it, like all other programs at the university, reflects our culture of community and respect for others and that our student athletes are held to the same high standards of conduct as all our students.'

According to Nashville police, the four men are charged with raping the unconscious woman inside Vandenburg's room at Gillette House dormitory early on June 23. University officials checking the dorm's surveillance in the hallways on an unrelated matter noticed the four's behavior and notified the Vanderbilt University Police Department the night of June 25. Campus police contacted Nashville's sex crimes unit June 26.

Vanderbilt did not identify the four players until July 15 before the Commodores headed to Alabama for Southeastern Conference media days. The players already were listed in the team's media guide for the upcoming season but no longer are on the roster.

None of the four played a snap for Vanderbilt last season. Batey came in last season as a receiver and redshirted behind Jordan Matthews and Chris Boyd before switching to safety this spring.

Banks also redshirted as a freshman last season. His attorney Grover Collins declined to comment on the indictment but said last month that Banks is innocent and fully cooperating with police.

McKenzie redshirted in 2012, but the 5-foot-8 receiver had four catches for 83 yards in the Commodores' spring game -- the most yards receiving in the game. His attorney, Jodie Bell, did not immediately return a message by the AP. The 6-foot-5 Vandenburg was considered one of the top junior college tight ends nationally coming out of Xavier College Prep, and he became the first junior college transfer at Vanderbilt since Jordan Rodgers in 2010.

The Commodores, who went 9-4 and won the Music City for their best season since 1915 last season, opens the 2013 season Aug. 29 hosting Mississippi.
