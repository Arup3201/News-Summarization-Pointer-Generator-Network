For fair-weather cyclists or recreational skiers who hit the slopes once every year or two, having the right kit might seem like an extravagant investment.

But wearing a fully functional helmet could save your life in the event of accident.

To solve the problem of people using old or damaged equipment, a hi-tech skiing helmet has been invented that has a system of stress sensors all over it.

Hi-tech helmet: POC's Skull Orbic H.I. MIPS helmet uses a system of stress sensors to measure the amount of damage it sustains as the result of impacts and adds them up over time to tell a person when the helmet is no longer effective

The Skull Orbic H.I. MIPS helmet measures the amount of damage it sustains as the result of impacts and adds them up over time.

Users can check the integrity of the helmet lining by pressing a button on the back.

It also comes with MIPS - a multi-directional impact protection system - to help reduce forces to the brain in the event of a crash (stock image)

When the helmet has sustained impacts that rise above a recommended level, a red light turns on to let the athlete know it is time to invest in a new helmet.

It also comes with MIPS – a multi-directional impact protection system – to help reduce forces to the brain in the event of a crash.

The helmet, which is made by Swedish company POC, is set to be launched this autumn and will cost $480 (£289), according to Gizmodo.

It is the follow-up to the Skull Orbic Comp helmet, which has a deflector panel that allows slalom gates to be deflected without hitting the head so hard.

It could mean that serious holiday skiers could invest in the helmet and keep it for a while, knowing it is still effective, or more likely, it could be used by professionals who hit the slopes on a regular basis to tell when their protective kit has worn out.

The racing helmet has already won an award, even before going on sale and has been called ‘one of the most effective helmets in the world.’

The company is also rolling out a recreational helmet with built in Beats by Dr Dre speakers in Autumn.

The new helmet, which will go on sale for $480 in autumn, is the follow-up to the Skull Orbic Comp helmet (pictured), which has a deflector panel that allows slalom gates to be deflected without hitting the head so hard
