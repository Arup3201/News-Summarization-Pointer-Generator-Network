For many disastrous cooks, boiling an egg is the one task in the kitchen that they can actually master.

However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand.

The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. 

The downside? At £1.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg.

Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon

Marketed as the Yowk - 'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the 'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. 

The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with.

The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. 

This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg.

And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven

Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk

Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water.

New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013.

He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy.

'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.'

The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May.

A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer.
