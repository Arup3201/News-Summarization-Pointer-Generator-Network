The twin sister of Down syndrome baby Gammy will be allowed to stay with her Australian parents despite her father's history of child sex offences.

David and Wendy Farnell caused outrage earlier this year when they abandoned Gammy with his Thai surrogate mother but took his healthy sister Pipah back to Bunbury in Western Australia. 

After the scandal broke, it was revealed Farnell, 56, had been convicted of 22 child sex offences in the late 1990s, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. 

Since then authorities in WA have been looking at whether the Farnells are suitable parents and should be allowed to care for baby Pipah.

The 56-year-old and his wife, Wendy, sparked international outrage after a Thai surrogate accused them of taking their healthy twin daughter Pipah back home to Australia but abandoning their Down syndrome son Gammy in Bangkok

Western Australian Child Protection Minister Helen Morton said on Friday the family would receive an independent children’s lawyer, a significant safety plan and active monitoring of the family by the department, the ABC reported

'The members of the safety network are all well aware of the issues involved, their role and responsibility in the child's safety and wellbeing, and have formally agreed to report and future concerns to the department,' Ms Morton said. 

The Farnells have denied leaving behind now nine-month-old baby Gammy, insisting they were forced to flee with his healthy twin sister before Thai authorities tightened surrogacy laws in the midst of a military coup.

Farnell was sentenced to three years behind bars in 1997, and months later, while still imprisoned, he was charged again with six counts of indecent dealings with a child.

Recently, reports emerged that the mother of an alleged fourth victim decided against further action as she believed court proceedings will cause more stress and damage on her young daughter.

In an interview with 60 Minutes on Nine Network in August, Farnell said his previous urges which saw him convicted for child sex offences have '100 percent stopped'.
