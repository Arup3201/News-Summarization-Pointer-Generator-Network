Severe thunderstorms threaten to cause life-threatening flash floods in the Midwest from the plains to the Great Lakes today and tomorrow welcoming the first day of summer with less than sunny weather conditions.

The north-central Plains from Minnesota and Iowa to west-central Kansas and eastern Colorado could experience hail, strong winds, and dangerous lighting, reports Weather.com.

The risk of tornadoes is lower than it has been in previous years but Iowa's first day of summer is marked by thunderstorm and flash flood watch and tornadoes are not out of the question.

Parts of Illinois and Wisconsin are also under a severe thunderstorm watch, reported the National Weather Service.

A long week of rainfall also put places like South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri at risk for flooding and has caused the Missouri River's water levels to rise.

Accuweather.com reports that rainfall between two or three times that of normal amounts has fallen on parts of the northern and central Plains this June.

The upper Mississippi River is also on the rise and a large part of the central and northern plains will over a foot of rain.Â 

'Any additional heavy rainfall over this region will quickly runoff, leading to additional flash flooding of fields, roads, and rises on area rivers and streams,' the weather service said.

NBC reports that thunderstorms in Chicago yesterday caused delays following a ground stop at O'Hare International Airport.
