Queen Letizia battled the elements as she attended the 'V De Vida' Award last night in San Sebastian, Spain.

Attending solo without her husband King Felipe, Letizia seems increasingly at ease with her royal duties, smiling confidently at the waiting photographers and crowds, and pausing to shake hands with one wheelchair bound fan who had waited out in the rain to meet her.

Despite being hounded by the wind- her hair blown  around her face, Letizia took time to stop for the elderly woman, bending down to speak to her.

Gesturing widely, Letizia seemed to be making a comment about the awful weather to the woman, who grasped the Queen’s arm with her hand.

The ceremony took place at the Victoria Eugenia Theater and Letizia, who earlier in the day had attended a fundraiser 'Ayudas a Investigación Oncológica' of Spanish Association Against Cancer wore an over-the knee Hugo Boss dress.

Despite the inclement weather, the 42-year-old forwent a coat or jacket, leaving her ultra-toned arms exposed as she swept into the event.

In a pair of black stilettos, Letizia also left her slender legs bare for the awards.
