Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will make a rare appearance together on Saturday in Selma, Alabama, as they commemorate the the 50th anniversary of historic civil rights protests that sounded the death knell for voter discrimination.

The former and current U.S. leaders and their families will join the largest-ever congressional delegation in the Alabama town a day before an annual march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge that salutes the 600 demonstrators who were violently assaulted by Alabama state troopers on March 7, 1965 on what is now known as Bloody Sunday.

The clash resulted in the speedy introduction of the Voter's Rights Act, which was signed into law in August of that year by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Bush are pictured here arriving at a 2013 wreath-laying ceremony for the victims of the 1998 US Embassy bombing at the Bombing Memorial in Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania.

The march itself will take place on Sunday, March 8, but thousands are expected to flock to Selma on Saturday to listen to President Obama give remarks at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The event is open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.

The yearly sojourn to Selma, held since 1998 and organized by the Faith and Politics Institute, will be made by 95 members of Congress. 

That includes 23 Republicans, the largest group of lawmakers from the political party to attend since the first pilgrimage, according to USA Today.

Alabama Reps. Terri Sewell, a Democrat, and Martha Roby, a Republican, will lead the delegation, along with Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a participant in the original 1965 march.

'We are very pleased that the Faith and Politics Institute is gathering an unprecedented amount of senators and members of Congress in bipartisan fashion to honor and reflect upon the history of the civil rights movement and the work that still needs to be done,' Rob Liberatore, the Faith and Politics Institute's chairman of the board, told the news publication.

All living U.S. presidents were invited to participate in the event but just Bush and his wife Laura and Obama and his wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia will be in Selma on Saturday, USA Today reports.

'President and Mrs. Bush believe it’s important to honor such a seminal date in the history of human dignity and human rights,' Freddy Ford, a spokesman for Bush, told the New York Times. 'They are pleased to have been invited and are looking forward to attending.'

Bush and Obama also spoke at a Texas event in 2014 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act but they were not on the dais at the same time, as they will be this weekend.

At a White House event last week Obama said he would bring his daughters with him to Selma because he wants to 'remind them of their own obligations.'

'There are going to be marches for them to march and struggles for them to fight,' he said. 'And if we’ve done our job, then that next generation is going to be picking up the torch as well.'

The Senate and the House recently approved legislation that would award the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor aside from the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to 1965 marchers. It now awaits the president's signature.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a lead sponsor of the bill in the Senate said Friday after the bill's passage in the upper chamber that the 'award is a small token of our collective national gratitude to the courageous men and women who sacrificed so much to move our country forward.'

'As we confront the myriad of challenges our country continues to face, we do so with the knowledge that we drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not ourselves dig,' he said in a statement.
