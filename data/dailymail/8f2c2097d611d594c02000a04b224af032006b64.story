Former Newcastle team-mates Mathieu Debuchy and Moussa Sissoko were reunited as France beat Spain 1-0 in Paris.

Loic Remy's second half goal was enough to condemn Spain to their third defeat in their last four games. 

After the game, Sissoko posted a photo of him and Debuchy in the changing rooms of the Stade de France.

Winner: Chelsea forward Loic Remy, who was also at Newcastle last season, scored the winning goal

He said: 'Great win tonight against Spain!!! Well done to the team!!!'

The French pair played together at Newcastle last season but, after Bacary Sagna's departure to Manchester City, Arsenal brought Debuchy to London.

Loic Remy also played with them at Newcastle but after a brief period back with his parent club QPR, and a failed move to Liverpool, he was sold to Chelsea.
