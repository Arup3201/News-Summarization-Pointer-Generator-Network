Police have launched a new bid to charge serial child killer Robert Black with the murder of 13-year-old schoolgirl Genette Tate who disappeared 36 years ago. 

Devon and Cornwall Police have long suspected Black of murdering Genette, who was last seen in a rural lane in Aylesbeare, Devon, in 1978. Her body has never been found.

However, there now hope for a prosecution in the case after Black last year lost an appeal against his latest conviction for the murder of nine-year-old Jennifer Cardy.

He had argued that his trial was prejudiced because details about three other child murders he had already been jailed for were revealed to the jury.

Police told the BBC they are now liaising with the Complex Case Unit of the Crown Prosecution Service to see if the appeal court ruling has 'any bearing on the Genette Tate case'.

They added: 'This liaison is still at a very early stage and will take some time to complete.'

Black was found guilty in 1994 of three child murders in the 1980s - those of 11-year-old Susan Maxwell, from the Scottish Borders, five-year-old Caroline Hogg, from Edinburgh, and Sarah Harper, 10, from Morley, near Leeds.

His reign 
of terror finally ended in 1990 when he was caught red-handed with a 
six-year-girl hooded, bound, gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the
 back of his van in the Scottish village of Stow. 

He had sexually assaulted her moments earlier.

In
 2012 he was prosecuted for a fourth murder, that of Jennifer, who was 
snatched as she cycled to a friend’s house in Ballinderry, County 
Antrim, Northern Ireland, in 1981.

The paedophile is serving a total of 12 life sentences for murder and kidnap.

Genette’s
 father, John Tate, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he hoped 
police had not overlooked any other suspect by spending time focusing on
 Black.

Asked
 how he had coped in the decades since Genette went missing, Mr Tate 
said it had been difficult as the incident was never far from his mind.

'You look at everything that it could possibly be to do with her. You just cope very poorly sometimes.'Mr Tate said he believed the police had coped very well with the case.

The
 mystery remains Britain’s longest running missing person inquiry but 
police have admitted that she was kidnapped and murdered.

Genette was 13 when she vanished while delivering newspapers in her home village of Aylesbeare in East Devon in August 1978.

The
 police have asked the Crown Prosecution Service’s Complex Casework Unit
 to examine whether Black can be brought to trial for Genette’s murder.

Yesterday Genette’s father John said: 'I want them to go ahead and put Black before a court.

'Let a jury decide whether he did it. I want to know what he did with her.'

Speaking from his home in Manchester, Mr Tate, 72, who is battling cancer, diabetic and is in a wheelchair: 'I am not 100 per cent Black is responsible. I have a little bit of doubt.

'I think about her every day. It is a nightmare that never goes away. Despite what other people say, we will never get closure.

'It is so difficult because we will never know the answers to our questions. We don’t know if she was buried in some isolated spot or whether she was left wandering around somewhere.

'I would love to be able to find out where he is an finally be able to lay her to rest after nearly 40 years of this living hell.'

A senior police source said that if the attempt to use bad character evidence was unsuccessful, detectives may once again interview Black in prison.

But the officer said, it was 'a long shot' as Black has previously refused to co-operate when officers had been to Wakefield jail to see him.

One former detective said previously: 'Black played a game. He wanted to barter. He wanted a move to a Scottish jail and would not talk until he got his way.'

He also refused to meet Genette’s father John who wrote to him and asked him for a face to face meeting.

Police from different forces spent months trying to track Black’s movements in relation to various child murder cases.

They were able to say the former delivery driver had been spotted by Exeter airport - a short distance from Genette’s home village of Aylesbeare - and used petrol receipts to see where he had been travelling - but it is was never enough evidence to pursue a murder charge.

Tim Swarbrick, a retired Devon and Cornwall Police Superintendent, said: 'Cases like this are never closed. It would mean a great deal to the police and the community to see the mystery of Genette’s disappearance finally solved.'

Black was arrested by Devon and Cornwall Police in 2005 in connection with Genette’s disappearance but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.
