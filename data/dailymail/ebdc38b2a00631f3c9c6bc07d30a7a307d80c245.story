Nineteen days after Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a gun battle with police, there remains a question mark over where his body will be laid to rest.

The chief of police in Worcester, near Boston, has called for a resolution, complaining that it is costing tens of thousands of dollars to protect the funeral home where Tsarnaev’s body is currently being kept amid protests.

‘The police department is expending resources that could be used for other needs in our community,’ Police Chief Gary Gemme said. ‘Beyond this there is a need to do the right thing. We are not barbarians. We bury the dead.’

He has called for unspecified officials to wade into the issue, which has dragged on for several days and triggered protests at the Main South funeral home.

‘I am publicly appealing to those with authority to provide a burial site to do so and do so quickly,’ he said.

Tsarnaev was fatally wounded in Watertown, just outside Boston, after police confronted him in a stolen car. He was shot several times by police, then was run over with the car by his fleeing brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his accomplice in the deadly April 15 bombing, authorities have said.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body was released by the state medical examiner May 1 and has been in limbo since. Tsarnaev's widow had wanted his body turned over to his side of the family, which claimed it.

Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has reportedly told the director of the funeral home that she would now prefer to bring the body back to Russia for burial

A deal had been struck Monday to bury the remains of Tsarnaev, a 26-year-old ethnic Chechen from southern Russia, at a state prison site, but it dissolved after state officials stopped cooperating Tuesday, Gemme said.

Peter Stefan, whose funeral home accepted Tsarnaev's body last week, said Tuesday that none of the 120 offers of graves from the U.S. and Canada has worked out because officials in those cities and towns don't want the body.

The suspect's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, reportedly told the director of the funeral home that she would now prefer to bring the body back to Russia for burial, even though doing so would cost thousands of dollars.

But there is no guarantee Tsarnaeva would even get a chance to see her son, reports ABC.

Russian authorities could declare Tamerlan Tsarnaev a terrorist and deny his family their right to claim the body, according to the Russian legal experts, including one who is advising the family.

Protesters stand across the street from Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, they are upset about the possibility that Boston marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev may be buried in the U.S.

The family would be presented only with a certificate stating that he had been buried by the government.

An
expert in U.S. burial law said the resistance to Tsarnaev's burial is 
unprecedented in a country that has always found a way to put to rest 
its notorious killers, from Lee Harvey Oswald to Adam Lanza, who gunned 
down 20 children and six educators at a Newtown, Conn., elementary 
school last year.

‘It's very unusual that people are so fixated on this,’ said Tanya Marsh, a Wake University professor.

‘There
are a lot of evil people buried in marked graves in the United States. 
Traditionally, in the United States, ...when somebody dies, that's the 
end of their punishment.’

A solution may be found in Massachusetts law, which requires a community to provide a place to bury someone ‘dying within its limits.’

Decision time: Peter Stefan told a news conference on Monday that a decision had to be reached after the city of Cambridge refused to bury the body of suspected bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev there

Tsarnaev
lived in Cambridge, across the Charles River from Boston, but was 
pronounced dead at a Boston hospital, meaning Boston would be obligated 
to bury him under a straight reading of the law.

But
Marsh said there's a better legal case to bury the body in Cambridge 
because, in practice, where a person lived has been the key factor in 
determining the place of burial.

Cambridge's rules for buying a grave at the municipal cemetery require that ‘the deceased must be a Cambridge resident,’ according to online guidelines of the Cambridge Department of Public Works.

Boston also makes residency the key requirement of its cemetery burial rules.

‘It's been the city's contention that he was not a Boston resident and therefore should not be buried in the city of Boston,’ said John Guilfoil, a spokesman for Mayor Thomas Menino.

But Cambridge's city manager has urged the Tsarnaev family not to try to bury Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the city, citing the potential massive disruption. A city spokeswoman said Wednesday that nothing had changed.

Angry: Dozens of protestors have begun picketing Stefan's business, like Scott Schaeffer-Duffy, pictured, who crossed the Boston marathon finish line minutes before the bombs detonated

Watching: Police remained at funeral parlors where the body of Tsarnaev was taken and where protestors followed
