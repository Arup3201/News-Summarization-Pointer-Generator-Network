Hospital consultants who refuse to publish their patient death rates will be sacked under a transparency drive, the NHS said yesterday.

Cancer units will also have to publish statistics showing how many patients survive their treatment, allowing people to compare services. 

The warning comes a few days before a third of the country’s consultants are expected to refuse to publish their performance statistics.

Hospital staff who don't publish their patient death rates could face losing their jobs under transparency drive

This week, for the second year running, the NHS will publish the death rates of England’s surgeons.

Some 5,000 surgeons are thought to have agreed to the process - but another 2,500 have refused.

Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, warned that from next year consultants who do not allow their data to be published will not pass their five-yearly revalidation or be awarded financial bonuses.

Last year’s exercise showed that 16 surgeons saw patients die in 10 per cent of operations.

One doctor, a vascular surgeon, recorded a death rate of 31 per cent - ten times the national average and 30 times higher than some of his colleagues.

Patients have the right to refuse to be operated on by a particular surgeon if they are concerned about their performance.

Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, said providing the information is vital to improve the safety of treatment

Sir Bruce, who is himself a heart surgeon, said such information is vital to improve the safety of treatment.

He acknowledged that publishing the consultant death rates was unpopular with many, but added: ‘This is not going to go away.

‘We are looking now at a series of inducements, penalties to force that,’ he told the Sunday Times.

‘On the personal level is the revalidation, there are also clinical excellence awards [financial bonus].

‘If you want to progress with your clinical excellence award, if you have refused to allow your data to be published, then that will affect your progression.’

Some surgeons have publicly criticised the NHS transparency drive as ‘meaningless’.

Professor Peter McCollum, a leading vascular surgeon at Hull Royal Infirmary, last year refused to publish his own death rates.

He said it was a flawed exercise and that death rates do not tell the whole story.

When a surgeon only carries out a small number of operations, a couple of deaths could occur by chance but they would skew overall outcome, he said.

‘It puts a huge amount of pressure on younger consultants not to do difficult cases which is absurd because many of those cases need to be done,’ Professor McCollum said last year.

‘The data is fairly meaningless. There are other ways of picking up bad surgeons. The problem is that if you want information this data must be interpreted by an expert and that is not what has happened on this occasion.

‘We would prefer our results to be analysed at unit level, with a much larger number of cases albeit spread over a number of surgeons.’

But Sir Bruce said that the effect would stop surgeons doing operations for which others have better expertise.

‘We will lose some surgeons,’ he said. ‘We will, and have as a consequence of this endeavour.

Professor Peter McCollum, left, who last year refused to publish his death rates and, right, health secretary Jeremy Hunt said that transparency over cancer treatment will help NHS improve its care

‘The other thing that is more likely, and will help with quality, is that those surgeons who are doing just a small number of operations will think, “I’m not doing that any more”, and they will pass on those operations to their colleagues.’

The NHS will also order hospitals to publish cancer survival rates from next year.

Every hospital will be obliged to publish its one- and five-year survival rates for breast, bowel, lung and prostate cancer.

Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, said: ‘Cancer remains our biggest killer, which is why we want to be the best country in Europe for cancer outcomes. More transparency in this area will help the NHS improve cancer care and learn from the best.’
