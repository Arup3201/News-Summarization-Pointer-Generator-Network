The Taliban have claimed responsibility for an insider attack by an Afghan soldier that killed three American contractors at a Kabul airport on Thursday.

A spokesman for the insurgent group said that the attacker's name was Ehsanullah and that he was from Laghman Province in the east of the country. 

The Taliban said the soldier 'opened fire on invaders,' according to the Washington Post.

The names of the contractors, who were working to train the Afghan air force, were not released. 

The Taliban said the soldier, whom they called an 'infiltrator,' was 'martyred by return fire,' the Post reports. 

A fourth American was injured in the attack and the US-led coalition confirmed that an Afghan, believed to be the attacker, was killed. 

The attack occurred at an Afghan military base at the North Kabul International Airport complex.

'Insider attacks' by Afghan security forces have been on the rise in recent years and have led to the deaths of 142 people.

Western troops and civilians training Afghan security forces have faced lethal assaults from Afghans in uniform who turn their guns on their counterparts. 

They have had a major impact on trust between US and NATO and Afghan forces since 2008 and leading up to the winding down of combat operations in the country.

In August Major Gen. Harold J. Greene was the highest ranking official to be killed in four decades in a war zone as the result of an 'insider attack.'  

The airport in the Afghan capital Kabul is heavily guarded, with one section devoted to commercial aircraft and another area set aside for a NATO contingent.

Thursday's attack came after a surge in violence by the Taliban insurgency over the past year.

At least nine people were killed earlier Thursday in the country's east when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive at a funeral for victims of a roadside bomb attack.

Most NATO combat troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year but a small contingent of about 12,000 remains in the country, including roughly 10,600 American forces.

The American soldiers, along with other NATO troops and private contractors, are helping the Afghans improve their logistics and build up a fledgling air force.
