These gorgeous pictures of tranquil lakes show autumn in its full glory - but scenes like this will soon be behind us as Britain prepares for the rigours of winter.

With winter officially beginning next weekend, these stunning scenes capture the Lake District's beauty mirrored in the still waters in a moment of late November calm.

The glassy water surfaces and rich colours of the season provided a final spectacular autumnal display, with picture-perfect views of Brothers Water, Grasmere, Ullswater, Thirlmere and Bassenthwaite lakes.

The meteorological winter - spanning the entirety of December, January, and February - officially begins this Sunday, December 1.

Temperatures are already dropping, with a week of fog, overnight frost, some scattered showers, as well as some sunny spells. Parts of northern Scotland could drop to -2 to -4C.

Weather news agency Meteogroup says the start of the week will be largely dry across the UK with mist and fog forming across much of Wales and Scotland - away from north-east Scotland.

Some of this fog may turn to freezing fog in parts of central and northern Scotland. Elsewhere, it will be mostly cloudy but a few clear spells may develop towards southern and south-western parts of England during the early hours.

It will be a chilly night across many places with the risk of a frost forming. However, the south-east quarter of England and along eastern coasts of England are expected to remain frost free.

Today, mist and fog will be slow to clear across parts of Wales and central and western parts of Scotland during the morning, although some brighter conditions may develop through the afternoon.

Thicker low cloud lingering in parts of western Scotland and Northern Ireland may give a few spots of drizzle. Elsewhere in the UK, it will be mostly dry but with a fair amount of cloud early on that may be stubborn to break up in the afternoon allowing bright or sunny spells to break through.

Glittering: Although the skies in may places are clear today, fog will hit much of the UK in the coming week
