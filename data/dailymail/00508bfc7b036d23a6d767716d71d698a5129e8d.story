More than 1,000 students and staff members were evacuated from a high school in New Jersey this morning after a chemistry lab experiment went wrong.

The blunder, which took place at Kingsway Regional High School around 7:40am, released potentially toxic fumes into the air and emergency services were called out to inspect the area.

Twelve students and five faculty members who were in the chemistry lab at the time were taken to hospital for precautionary exams. 

The blunder, which took place at Kingsway Regional High School (pictured) around 7:40am, released potentially toxic fumes into the air and emergency services were called out to inspect the area 

They had reportedly been conducting tests with lauric acid which can cause respiratory problems if inhaled. It can also cause eye and skin irritation.

The substance was being heated to show changes in temperature and its believed a contaminant in a beaker created a bad reaction, triggering plumes of smoke. 

Everyone on site was escorted to the middle school building. 

Shortly after 9am students were given the go-ahead to return to classrooms and resume their schedule.

The hospitalized patients were also released and are said to be doing 'fine'.

The chemistry lab in question will remain closed as investigation and clean-up continues. 

Regardless of the incident, students had been scheduled for early release Monday due to the approaching snow storm.
