A four-year-old boy who went to bed with only pink eye died in his sleep hours later from enterovirus 68.

Eli Waller of Hamilton Township, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Atlantic City, is the first fatality linked directly to a strain of enterovirus that has infected more than 500 people. 

Waller was asymptomatic before his death and the onset of his illness was rapid, according to Hamilton Township Health Officer Jeff Plunkett said.

He had stayed home from preschool on September 24 with a case pink eye that the medical examiner found to be unrelated to the virus. 

Today his father  spoke out for the first time telling of his son's loving character and a new foundation in his honor.  

On Sunday Andy Waller released a statement and photos of his four-year-old son describing him  as a 'shy little puppy who wants only to make people proud and happy.'

'He was a beautiful mix of eagerness and hesitancy,' need and striving, caution and surprise,' Waller wrote, 'all of which were grounded in a pure, unconditional love.'

Waller wrote that he and Eli's mother are proud of their son who is the youngest of triplets and was born 'smaller and lighter than his sisters.'

'Eli nevertheless persevered through all the difficulties that came his way,' Waller wrote.

'Eli was not the type to give up, and even though things never really came easily to him, he would just plug away, day after day, practicing sounds, or movements, or skills, until he would eventually get them.'

Waller told NBC New York that the family is in the process of establishing a fund in Eli's honor to provide support for students involved in Special Education called The First Day of School Foundation. 

'...it is our sincere hope that this Foundation can work to help kids in a way that will make Eli proud of us all, in the same way that we were all so proud of him,' Waller wrote.

On Saturday, local officials announced at a press conference that a Mercer County medical examiner ruled the cause of death as Enterovirus-D68,NJ.com reports.  

CNN reports that though the virus was found in four other patients who died in September, Waller's is the first case in which the virus was determined as the cause of death.  

CNN reports that more than 500 cases of the enterovirus have been reported nationwide in 43 states and the District of Columbia as of Friday.

Enterovirus-D68 was identified in 1962 and those who catch the virus usually only experience a runny nose or low-grade fever, NBC New York reports. 

Recently, the virus has become more problematic due to its link to more severe illnesses.
