A two-year-old Virginia boy who was born without both thumbs is learning to use his hands for the first time after doctors were able to recreate the digits using his index fingers.

Connor Woodle was born in Charlottesville in 2012 with a condition called thumb aplasia, which affects one in about 100,000 infants.

Doctors said it was incredibly rare for a child to be born without thumbs but still have four normally-functioning fingers on each hand.

But Connor's parents worried it was an ailment that would substantially affect him for life.

The boy born without thumbs: Connor Woodle was born without thumbs on both hands but with eight normally-functioning fingers

Rare condition: Thumb aplasia affects aly about one in every 100,000

Adjustment: As he grew older, Connor adjusted to life without thumbs, and would pick things up like a crab

Worried: Connor's father, Jason Woodle, was the first to notice his son's hands when he was born

'My first thoughts were: How is he going to be able to function in the world?' his father, Jason Woodle, told TODAY Health.

'Everything from five-fingered gloves to being able to reel in a fishing rod to being able to play a video game.'

'Even something as simple as hitting a space bar on a keyboard – we take our thumbs for granted.'

As he got older, Connor adjusted to not having thumbs and would use his fingers like a crab claw to pick things up.

But his parents wanted more for him.

After an assessment at the University of Virginia Hand Center, doctors believed they could perform a surgery called digit polliciza­tion.

The procedure involved removing Connor's index fingers, shortening them, and then attaching them to the place where he thumbs would have normally been.

Concerned parents: Jason and Joan Woodle went to great lengths to ensure the best for their son

Expert: Orthopedic surgeon at the University of Virginia Hand Center, Dr. Bobby Chhabra, was the doctor who decided to perform the digit polliciza­tion on Connor

The end result would still leave him only four fingers, but he would have a fully-functioning hand.

It was a multi-hour surgery for each hand and extremely complex.

The doctors would reconnect the vessels and nerves to create Connor thumbs.

'It’s an incredibly elegant operation,' the orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Bobby Chhabra, told TODAY.

'This is one of the more complex operations that I do because a child’s hand is very small.

'The structures, blood vessels, nerves — everything is miniscule.'

A major part of the procedure was ensuring that the new thumbs would grow naturally with Connor, so that he wouldn't have tiny baby thumbs for the rest of his life.

He underwent the surgeries at the age of one.

Because of the intensity of the operations, they were performed seven months apart.

And both were a success.

New lease: Connor has quickly adjusted to his new thumbs and picked up how to use his hands

Success: Connor still only has four fingers on his hands - he is missing his index fingers - but he as able to use his hands as a normal person would

Growing up: Connor is now able to use the strength he couldn't when he was without thimbs

'I was in tears. It was a big, big thing for me to be able to see that,' Mr Woodle said.

'For him, too. For his first hand, when we took the cast off he held his hand up and he kind of stared at his hand.'

Now two-and-a-half, Connor has quickly adjusted to his new hands and is capable of most things children the same age as him are.

Most people are also unable to tell he is missing his index fingers.
