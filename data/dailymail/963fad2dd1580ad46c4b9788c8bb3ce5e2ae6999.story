Chelsea midfielder Oscar says Cesc Fabregas has lifted Chelsea up to a new level this term with his contribution.

Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League and Fabregas has nine assists, one for Oscar's fine goal in the 2-1 win over QPR on Saturday.

The Brazilian is grateful to the Spaniard for his service, but insists it's not just the former Arsenal star's assists that have improved the Blues midfield.

Oscar believes Fabregas has been a superb signing for Chelsea this season, transforming the team

'Cesc gave a beautiful pass to me,' Oscar told Chelsea TV. 'It was perfect for shooting and when the ball came I decided now, I need to shoot.

'I donâ€™t know if it is my best goal - I need to see it again - but it was a nice goal.

'But Cesc helps the team so much and not just with the assists. In a game, he helps everyone, with beautiful passes like the one for me in this game.

'He has come in this year and played so well and I like playing together with him.

'Last year the team was strong but this year the team plays so well and plays every game to win, and this is important for us.'
