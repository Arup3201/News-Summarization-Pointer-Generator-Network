It seems the ‘Butcher of Brooklyn’ almost succeeded in kidnapping another boy just three doors away from his home.

Levi Aron, 35, of Brooklyn, New York, has admitted suffocating eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky with a bath towel in his apartment.

Now his neighbour Zisa Berkowitz alleges that he tried to kidnap her young son but she scared him off by screaming.

Police have already spoken to Ms 
Berkowitz and she told the New York Post that the story is ‘true’ and 
she is going through ‘a lot of trauma’.

Levi Aron's ex-wife Diana Diunov, 38, has labelled him as a 'cold sociopath' and said he should not be allowed to claim insanity.

Diunov, who is in jail herself for wire fraud, told the New York Post her former husband had mental problems but was 'very nice' to her.

She even suggested he might have killed Leiby in order to become famous - deciding to 'try his luck' after watching the Casey Anthony case.

The alleged incident happened in the last two years and was reportedly in addition to another failed kidnap attempt around a week before the Leiby murder.

The news came as his ex-wife Diana 
Diunov, 38, labelled him as a 'cold sociopath' and said he should not be
allowed to claim insanity.

Aron allegedly stalked another 
11-year-old boy in Borough Park, Brooklyn, with the same car he used to 
kidnap Leiby, sources told The Daily.

The boy was allegedly walking home when he saw Aron’s car and thought it looked suspicious so he ran home to tell his parents.

Aron is currently in the 
Bellevue Hospital prison ward while he undergoes a psychiatric 
evaluation and has not been allowed visitors.

Leiby’s parents meanwhile are 
continuing the traditional Jewish mourning period for seven days known 
as ‘shiva’, reported the New York Post.

The family have also issued a 
statement expressing their thanks to everyone who has helped them, 
‘physically, emotionally and spiritually’.

It was claimed yesterday that Aron 
has a history of sexual deviance and abuse, according to a protective 
order filed by another former wife.

In court: Levi Aron appeared in court earlier this week following the horrific murder of little Leiby

She alleged he was physically abusive
and once crept up on her while she was sleeping to touch her 
inappropriately - even though they had already separated.

The frightening episode followed a 
phone call, during which he warned Debbie Kivel that 'if she did not 
have sexual relations with him, then he would kill himself, period.'

Aron has been charged with murder and admitted killing the boy to officials, according to law enforcement sources.
