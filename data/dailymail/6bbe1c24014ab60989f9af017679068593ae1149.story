Alanah Poullard may be the luckiest kindergartner in Washington D.C.

The 5-year-old daughter of a wounded veteran visited the White House on Friday for a Wounded Warrior event and took home more than just a glimpse of the president.

Poullard marched up to Obama in the East Room and asked him for a note excusing her absence from school. The president cooperated.

This is not the first time the president has written a note for a student's absence from school. In 2009, Obama wrote a note for a fourth grader Kennedy Corpus in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Her father, John Corpus of Green Bay, stood to ask Obama about health care during the president's town hall-style meeting at Southwest High School. He told Obama that his daughter was missing school to attend the event and that he hoped she didn't get in trouble.

'Do you need me to write a note?' Obama asked. The crowd laughed, but the president was serious.

'I thought he was joking until he started walking down,' Kennedy said after the event, showing off the note in front of a bank of television cameras. 'It was like the best thing ever.'

The President also wrote a note for Minnesota fifth grader Tyler Sullivan when he attended the President's Campaign Speech last June.
