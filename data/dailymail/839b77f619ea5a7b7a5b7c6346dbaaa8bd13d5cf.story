The airline passenger who was stabbed in the mouth by a needle hidden in his turkey sandwich aboard a flight from Amsterdam has been put on a newly-approved anti-HIV drug in case the pin was laced with disease.

James Tonges fears the needle could be part of a terrorist plot because others were found in a total of six sandwiches served to passengers aboard four Delta Airlines flights from the Dutch airport to the United States on Sunday.

The FBI has launched an investigation and has interviewed each of the passengers who found the inch-long sewing needles. Delta has responded by serving only pre-packaged products on its flights. The vendor that made the sandwiches says it has increased its security in light of the incidents.

Lurking in the turkey: Catering firm Gate Gourmet, which provides meals for 14 airlines including all long-haul British Airways flights from Heathrow, distributed six sandwiches that contained small sewing needles. They were found aboard six U.S.-bound flights out of Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Sunday

Needle scare: Delta said sewing needles, like the ones seen here, were found in six sandwiches

Mr Tongues told ABC's Good Morning 
America that he was two bites into the sandwich when he felt a sharp 
pain in the roof of his mouth.

'I thought at first that it was a 
toothpick, you know you have toothpicks in sandwiches sometimes that you
 don't see. And when I pulled it out, I found a needle and it's about a 
one-inch long needle,' he said.

Two minutes later, Dr Jack Drogt, a 
friend he had met earlier on the flight to Holland, notified a flight 
attendant that he had found a needle, as well.

Both men were flying business class from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport to Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Needles were also discovered on a second flight to Atlanta and another flight to Seattle.

The FBI is currently testing the needles to determine whether they were contaminated.

Mr Tonges said authorities put him on Truvada, a drug that was only recently approved to reduce the risk of contracting HIV. 

'The important thing for me is, since
 it did actually puncture the top of my mouth, I had to be put on 
medication for that and we're waiting to see if there's any other type 
of substance on the needles. They're doing their investigation right now
 and they're going to let me know,' he told GMA.

Gate Gourmet prepares over 200million meals a year from its 130 flight kitchens in 35 countries around the world.

It services more than 20 airlines including Delta Air Lines, British Airways, American Airlines, United Airlines, Qantas Airways, Air France, Emirates Airline,  Amtrak and EasyJet.

The firm employs more than 22,000 people worldwide. In the UK, British Airways is Gate Gourmet's largest customer.

In 2005, the caterer sacked 670 staff - mainly Asian women - from its airline meals service in a dispute over restructuring at Heathrow. It lost £25million at its operation at the airport the year before, and maintained that changes in working practices were needed.

In August of that year, a two-day wildcat action by British Airways ground staff at Heathrow stopped all the airline's flights leaving the airport.

The strike, in support of the Gate Gourmet workers, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated £40million ($72million).

It also left BA unable to provide normal in-flight meals once services resumed, with many passengers instead being given vouchers with which to buy their food from the airport.

After the BA staff had returned to work, the stand-off at Gate Gourmet rumbled on, with the sacked staff picketing outside the caterer's Heathrow factory.

To try to end the dispute, at the end of August Gate Gourmet offered all staff - including those that had been sacked - redundancy packages.

About 700 staff - 300 of those sacked and 400 from the existing Gate Gourmet employees - applied to accept the offer

Dr Drogt said he fears the needles could be part of a terrorist plot.

'It was so deliberate... This was not
 an incidental finding. The pins were identical. This all pointed 
towards something which was deliberate and meant to harm,' he said.

The
 sandwiches were made in the Amsterdam kitchen of catering company Gate 
Gourmet, and were to be served to business class passengers on Delta 
flights out of Schiphol Airport.

After the needles were found, passengers got pizza instead.

Gate Gourmet spokeswoman Christina 
Ulosevich said the company has gotten no reports of similar incidents on
 any of the other airlines it serves out of Amsterdam.

She said the company did not yet know how the needles got into the sandwiches.

Gate
 Gourmet issued a statement saying, 'We take this matter very seriously,
 and we have launched our own full-scale investigation.'

It also said it was 'heightening our already stringent safety and security procedures, to prevent any recurrence.'

But she declined to comment further, saying 'details of this matter must remain confidential.'

Delta says security has been increased in its food preparation process, and it is using more prepackaged food.

In a statement to MailOnline, the airline said: 'Delta is taking this matter extremely seriously and is cooperating with local and federal authorities who are investigating the incident.

The statement went on: 'Delta has taken immediate action with our in-flight caterer at Amsterdam to ensure the safety and quality of the food we provide onboard our aircraft.

'Delta requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is Delta's number one priority.'

The needle incident is the latest in a rash of troubles for the airline this month.

Last week, a 'pressurization issue' forced a jet traveling from Detroit to Washington, D.C., to declare an emergency.

Flight plan: All four flights with needles in their sandwiches were heading to the U.S. - including two to Atlanta

Dangerous: One passenger aboard a Delta plane was injured after biting into a sandwich containing a needle

The aircraft, carrying 152 passengers and six crew members, landed without incident and taxied to the gate. No injuries were reported.

On Thursday night, a Delta flight from New York to Madrid was turned around shortly after take-off when a federal air marshal found suspicious wires in a rear lavatory.

Although no explosives were found, officials discovered two pieces of a drinking straw about an inch and a half long with wires running through each.

The matter is under investigation.
