Dr Rexford Kennamer, a 'physician to the stars' whose clients included some of Hollywood's biggest names, has died in Alabama where he had lived in recent years, his relatives said Tuesday night. He was 93.

Mr Kennamer died at the Montgomery house he shared with his nephew, Richard Kennamer, on September 28.

Richard Kennamer said the physician had lived with him for the last five years after suffering stroke that left him unable to speak.

Before his family broke the news today about his death, Kennamer gave medical assistance to Elizabeth Taylor, and attended a funeral for husband Mike Todd in 1958 on her right arm with her brother (right)

'He had just been in declining health, but when he got here he still could communicate by writing very legible notes,' Kennamer said.

Mr Kennamer's relatives said he worked previously in a private practice in Beverly Hills, California, after receiving degrees from the University of Alabama and the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.

Mr Kennamer's clients included Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson â€” who co-starred alongside Doris Day in Pillow Talk and died in 1985.

Kennamer had apparently been close enough to Taylor to comfort the actress at her husband's funeral

The physician's family is planning a private service at a cemetery in his hometown of Guntersville, Alabama, Richard Kennamer said.

Rexford Kennamer was born July 4, 1920, and attended Lanier High School. He was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha, an honorary medical society, and had worked in California between 1954 and 2008, his relatives said.

The physician is survived by five nieces and five nephews.
