Diego Costa was involved in an incident with Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson that left some supporters claiming the Chelsea forward should have been sent off. Here, Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict...

Diego Costa is a superb centre-forward who plays like an old-fashioned English target man. He is no lightweight soft foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for diving at Burnley. 

There was evidence of the more robust nature of his play when he strongly pushed away Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson after he was being held in the area. 

Perhaps he could have been cautioned had referee Kevin Friend been slavish to the law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he should have been sent off. The fact he was not even booked perhaps levelled things up after his yellow card at Turf Moor.
