It is easy to pick on Juan Mata. He is not blessed with pace, he’s not a big player and he comes across as a quiet, humble guy. But you cannot argue with what he produces on the pitch.

He came off the bench to save Manchester United against Crystal Palace and he must be wondering what more he has to do to play regular football at Old Trafford.

11 - Juan Mata has been involved in 11 goals in his last 15 PL games for Man United. He has scored nine and set up two.

There is no doubting his quality — this is a player with a World Cup and European Championship to his name. But he found himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea and now seems to be in a similar position at Manchester United.

You have to credit him because he never causes a fuss or has a bad word to say. But make no mistake. He wants to play football.

He is too good to be a super sub at United and if he doesn’t get some more action, I could see him moving on or maybe even back to Spain.

AUSTIN'S IN DREAMLAND

Every weekend people up and down the country wake up and dream of playing football in the Premier League.

That’s why Charlie Austin’s is such a great story. Five years ago he was playing non-league football for Poole. Now he is rubbing shoulders with the likes of Sergio Aguero. He looks like he’s loving each second in the Premier League and he deserves every bit of it.

10 - Diego Costa (Chelsea)

8 - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)

7 - Saido Berahino (West Brom)

6 - Charlie Austin (QPR); Nacer Chadli (Spurs); Graziano Pelle (Southampton): Daifra Sakho (West Ham) 

For some players, life can be too easy, especially if they get huge wages at such a young age. After the journey he has been on, there’s no danger of Austin not appreciating where he is.

He is a throwback but he is a quality player. I worried when he missed a penalty on the opening day but he has proved himself with some fantastic goals.

He still has work to do, but he wants to improve and I like that about him. He certainly needs to work on his goal celebration! His dance was part of a dare organised on Sky’s Soccer AM programme, but he had to have a couple of cracks at it after having a goal disallowed.

His rise up the leagues has been a dream but it just goes to show that sometimes it’s never too late to make it in the big time.

CHELSEA'S CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

Much of the focus on Chelsea this season has centred around their attacking power: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard. It’s easy to pick out and praise the players who are firing in the goals.

But their defensive unit has been just as important, if not more so, in their success so far.

At the moment it looks like they have the perfect combination of goalkeeper and back four. John Terry is still a huge player for them and is obviously doing a fine job of improving Gary Cahill alongside him. Branislav Ivanovic is solid as a rock at right back and Cesar Azpilicueta did brilliantly to set up Costa’s goal at Anfield.

Thibaut Courtois is a huge presence behind them and Nemanja Matic must be a dream to have in front of your back four, always protecting the defence and putting out fires.

At the end of the Liverpool game Chelsea’s defenders came together for a huddle. If they keep that unit working for the rest of the season they will be hard to stop.

CITY HAVE TO MIND THE GAP

Sergio Aguero aside, City have been poor this season. At times they have been a one-man team.

It was a fantastic game against QPR but whatever Manuel Pellegrini says, they were lucky to escape Loftus Road with a point on Saturday.

They had a slow start last season — they were six points off the top at the same stage — and came back to win it. But the landscape of the league has changed.

Chelsea look so strong and if City aren’t careful they could be out of the running before they know it. The international break has come at a good time because they desperately need something to change and soon.

A MASTERCLASS FROM MONTERO

The South American invasion is in full swing in the Premier League, but not many people would have expected an Ecuadorian to upstage a Chilean on Sunday.

Alexis Sanchez looked like he had won it for Arsenal, but Swansea completed a magnificent fightback thanks in no small part to Jefferson Montero. He put on an exhibition of old-school wing play.

He was strong, quick and went past Calum Chambers at will. It’s not a game the young defender will want to watch back, but he should do so he can learn from the experience because Montero was magnificent.

A MUCH NEEDED WIN TO BOOST BURNLEY 

It has been a rough ride for Burnley on their return to the Premier League.

I’m a fan of Sean Dyche and what he’s done at the club, but they really needed a result to kick-start their season, which they got against Hull.

Burnley need last season's strike pairing of Danny Ings (left) and Sam Vokes back together

47 - goals scored by Danny Ings and Sam Vokes in all competitions in 2013-14.

It’s all well and good getting draws but what they really needed was three points on the board.

At times they have defended well this season and kept a clean sheet against Hull, but what they really need is goals. They miss Sam Vokes, who was so deadly with Danny Ings last season. Once Vokes returns from injury, he will be desperate to fire Burnley up the league.
