Shia LaBoeuf's uncle claims he is 'seeking to impoverish' him after the actor filed a suit suing for the return of an $800,000 loan he made to his uncle, plus $39,999 in interest.

Barry Saide, 61, the actor's maternal uncle, filed papers seeking to have LaBoeuf's suit dismissed yesterday in Manhattan Supreme Court.

The papers claim Saide lent 'hundreds of thousands' of dollars to LaBeouf and his mother Shayne Saide before the actor hit the big-time, and that he wouldn't have accepted the loan from LaBoeuf if he knew it would come to this.

Close: Shia LaBoeuf was raised by his mother Shayne Saide following his parents' split, and according to Barry Saide, their financial situation was unstable

'Had I thought that Shayne and Shia would take this extraordinary step and seek to impoverish me, I never would have borrowed a dollar from Shia,' Saide claimed in the papers.

The loan was made by Shia to his uncle in 2009, after Saide's recruiting business United Staffing Solutions, which he has run for more than 30 years, suffered during the financial crisis.

Saide's court filings claim LaBeouf told him not to worry about the expense because he 'had more money than he could ever need.'

The affidavit notes that LaBoeuf is now a highly successful and well-paid movie star and that his Transformers films earned him $20 million, while he was paid $8 million for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.

Fiery: Shia LaBoeuf, pictured in Canne last year with his mother Shayne, has become known for his angry outbursts and now appears to be having a feud with his uncle

'Prior to Shia’s ascendancy to film stardom... I loaned Shayne hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist in the support of Shayne and Shia,' Saide's papers state.

'I never sought repayment of this money; Shayne, Shia and I are family.'

Saide says that he and his sister grew up poor on New York's Lower East Side. LaBoeuf's mother separated from his heroin-addict father soon after his 1986 birth and Saide said that her 'work history could best be described as itinerant... she never achieved any lasting financial success.'

According to the papers filed by 
LaBoeuf and his mother,  Saide signed a loan agreement agreeing to pay 
the actor and his mother back in 15 installments, with interest, 
beginning in January of 2011 and ending in April 2012. 

'Defendant has failed to pay a single 
installment of either principal or interest to me or to any entity 
controlled by me,' claims LaBoeuf's suit.

However,
Saide says the agreement he and his nephew signed states that the loan 
could be voided in exchange for a 25 per cent share in his business.

Saide says the case is a 'private, family matter' that 'should never have been elevated' to legal courts.

Neither Saide nor LaBoeuf has commented on the case, but Shayne Saide spoke to the New York Post yesterday.

She was unaware that her brother had responded to the suit she and her son filed earlier this year.

'You caught me off guard. I didn’t know that Barry is doing this,' she told the Post.

In response to Saide's claims that he had supported her financially during Shia LaBoeuf's childhood, she laughed.

'He has his own interpretation of life,' she said. 'He’s going to do what he has to do. That’s Barry.'
