Queens Park Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes has labelled the war of words between manager Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt an ‘embarrassment’.

Fernandes intervened on Tuesday after Taarabt responded to criticism about his physical condition by the QPR manager.

Redknapp, who guided QPR back into the Barclays Premier League last season but is battling to save his job as manager, claimed Taarabt was ‘three stone overweight’ during an amazing outburst following the 3-2 defeat by Liverpool at Loftus Road on Sunday.

Fernandes said: ‘As a club, we are fully aware of stories in the press over the last few days regarding Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt.

‘We regret these issues being played out in public and Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt have been notified of our disappointment regarding their handling of the situation. I have spoken to them both personally.

‘On behalf of the club, I would like to apologise to the QPR supporters for the embarrassment this has caused and confirm that the issue has been dealt with internally.

‘The club’s focus is now on the Aston Villa fixture next Monday and hopefully after a tough few days we can turn a negative into a positive and build on Sunday’s improved display.’

Fernandes, who was at Sunday’s game, is furious that the row between the pair has been made public. He appeared to tweet a message in support of Redknapp’s stance yesterday but later deleted it.

It read: ‘Professional players must be fit. If I do a job I’m ready to do the job. Full stop. The buck stops at you. It’s your body and your career.’

When asked about the fitness of the QPR'S Adel Taarabt, manager Harry Redknapp said:

'No, he's not fit: he's not fit to play football, unfortunately. He played in a reserve team game the other day, and I could have run about more than he did. So no, I can't pick him.

'I pick people that want to try, and deserve to be at a good football club like QPR, and want to work, and come in every day and want to work, and train, and show a good attitude. And that's what I got today from the players.

'When he starts doing that, whether he ever can do it, maybe he'll get a game. The other lads, I've got a fantastic group of lads here, absolutely superb, all of them.

'I can't keep protecting people who don't want to run about and train, who are about three stone overweight.

'What am I supposed to keep saying, keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don't train? What's the game coming to? The others are as good as gold.'  

Taarabt reported for training on Tuesday morning, but the majority of QPR players had been given the day off. The forward, who also worked under Redknapp at Tottenham, is expected to confront his manager on Wednesday for the first time since the Moroccan’s controversial interview with Sportsmail.

The PFA also threatened to get involved yesterday as the row between Redknapp and Taarabt escalated.

The dispute became public on Sunday afternoon when Redknapp was asked an innocuous question about Taarabt’s absence from the calamitous defeat against Brendan Rodgers’ side.

Taarabt, 25, has made only three appearances for Rangers this season, but claims he is fully fit and ready to play first-team football after recovering from an ankle injury.

On Monday he was pictured in Sportsmail lifting his top to prove he is in good physical condition.

On Sunday, when Redknapp was asked about Taarabt, he said: ‘I can’t keep protecting people who don’t want to run about and train, who are about three stone overweight.

‘What am I supposed to keep saying, keep getting your 60, 70 grand a week and don’t train? What’s the game coming to? The others are as good as gold.’

‘I am a professional - this is not about retaliation, this is about protecting my reputation. I played in that reserve game for 90 minutes and if he didn’t think I was running he could have taken me off. Maybe I didn’t perform like I could because it was a reserve team game and I was protecting myself.

‘Just because we are losing games I am not going to kick the ball in the stands. My job is to create, bring goals to the team. Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player. I can only get fitness playing Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won’t be fit.’

‘The training sessions aren’t the same standard as Milan, or what I would expect under another manager. They are not as intense, the players aren’t as motivated. It is the same as we used to do at Tottenham years ago. When we played West Ham he told the players “you’re not fit, you’re not this, you’re not that”.

‘I said “but the problem is we don’t have any plan in the game, we don’t know how to press as a team. It’s not about just running around, you need to play with your brain”.

‘I was thinking that West Ham didn’t have better players than us, but they were well organised.

‘Almost every time we lose the ball the opposition score. We need to do something about it.

‘If you work as a team you run less. If somebody sprints 100 metres they play a triangle round him and you are never going to get the ball.

‘If everybody runs 10m, 10m, 10m, then you are in shape, but we never do that. He doesn’t understand that. The coaches don’t have any influence on Harry - none. They are there just to be there.

‘Glenn Hoddle loves me, but I don’t know if Harry listens to him.

‘After West Ham he said all of the team is not fit. After Liverpool, because the performance was so good, he said everything was perfect - what, in one week, he changed the fitness? Impossible.’

‘I spoke with Les Ferdinand and he told me “what a player you are - you should be in the team every time. I followed you at Milan and you were fantastic”.

‘Les doesn’t speak to us in training, but he watches us and then goes to watch the kids as well. He knows me from my days at Tottenham so we have a good relationship.’

‘I don’t like the food at the training ground, but eat healthily like every other player. Simple.

‘My heaviest weight at Milan was 86kg (13st 8lb), my lightest 84kg - now I’m 85kg. It’s not true to say I’m not fit. He tried to give an excuse.

‘I was desperate to play before the game. I was fuming when I didn’t play. My father was calling and my family and I didn’t pick up. I love football, I go crazy when I don’t play. Why did he talk about someone not involved in that game?

‘The journalist was doing his job and asking if I was injured.

‘He should have said “when he is fit he will play”. He is not 30 or 35, he is an experienced manager and he should have controlled that situation. I didn’t do pre-season with the team because I had an ankle injury, so I wasn’t 100 per cent.

‘This club doesn’t deserve to be in the position it’s in. We have fantastic owners who are there to help us, and give us everything to perform.

‘There are not many owners like that and they deserve better. They are fantastic with me and everybody. They are very patient too.

‘There is no panic, they are relaxed, want to improve, make the club better and make the fans happy.’
