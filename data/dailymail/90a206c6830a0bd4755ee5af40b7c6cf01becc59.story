She might have two lovely daughters of her own but that doesn't mean Spain's Queen Letizia is immune to the charms of other people's children.

The Spanish Queen looked thrilled as an adorable little girl approached her with a posy of flowers as she arrived in Luxembourg for a state visit this morning.

With her was King Felipe, who looked equally smitten as he crouched down beside his wife to say hello to the child, who was warmly wrapped up against the November chill in a duck down coat and a pair of eye-catching striped tights.

State visit: The Spanish royal couple are visiting Luxembourg at the invitation of Grand Duke Henri

Letizia, 42, and Felipe, 46, are in Luxembourg at the invitation of the Duchy's Grand Duke, Henri, and his Cuban wife Maria Teresa.

Ever elegant, Letizia looked glamorous in a chic cream coat dress enlivened with a floral pattern created using the traditional Spanish blackwork embroidery technique.

Rather more modern was her softly-waved hairstyle and the stylish grey and cream clutch she carried for her arrival at the Palais Grand Ducal in the centre of Luxembourg City.

Once there, and in front of an excited crowd of well-wishers, she and Felipe were greeted by a dapper Duke Henri, 59, and his wife, who wore an elegant dip-dyed silk coat.

Also in the welcoming party was Henri's heir, Crown Prince Guillaume, 33, and his Belgian wife, Stéphanie de Lannoy, 30, who comes from a family descended from the Flemish royal house of Hainault, which, among others, produced several mediaeval English Queens.

Luxembourg's monarchy is one of the youngest in Europe and began in 1815 following the Congress of Vienna at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

Full independence under the Grand Dukes came just under 20 years later, when the Treaty of London enshrined Luxembourg's existence in international law and ended years of rule by the Burgundians, French, Prussians and the Dutch.

Although part of Luxembourg was later incorporated into what would, in 1839, become Belgium, the country remained intact through the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the First and Second World Wars.

Indeed, Luxembourg's monarchy has enjoyed a considerably smoother run over the last century than Spain's own, which was abolished during the dictatorship of General Franco and only reinstated under King Juan Carlos in the mid 1970s.

Juan Carlos, who stood down earlier this year, became the fourth monarch to abdicate in less than two years, following Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and King Albert II of Belgium.

The latter's heir, now King Philippe of the Belgians, 54, is first cousin to Grand Duke Henri and a regular visitor to Luxembourg.

Stylish: Letizia carried a grey and white clutch and wore a dress decorated with blackwork embroidery
