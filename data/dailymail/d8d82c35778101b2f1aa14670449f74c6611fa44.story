An aristocrat's son has died while in police custody in Kenya after being arrested for allegedly smoking cannabis.

Former Marlborough schoolboy Alexander Monson, 28, was taken ill a few hours after he was detained by officers in the coastal town of Diani.

But he died shortly after being taken to hospital for treatment, local police said.

The cause of death was still under investigation last night, with the dead man’s family waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination before making a statement.

But a close friend of Mr Monson, son of the 12th Baron (Nicholas) Monson, sensationally claimed ‘police brutality’ was a contributing factor in his death.

The friend said: ‘He was a great guy and I would love to see those bastards go to jail for what they have done.

‘His death was a result of a combination of things. I wouldn’t say it was murder, but it was definitely a case of neglect. He was being held in custody and was not given the medical assistance he needed. It wasn’t a pre-existing medical condition, it was something else that started it. Perhaps a certain amount of police brutality.’

Contemporaries of Mr Monson at £30,300-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire included Pippa Middleton, also 28, but it is unclear whether they were friends.

Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother Hilary, 58, and sister Isabella, 25.

The pair run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian ocean resort of Diani, where accommodation can cost up to £800 a night.

His maternal grandparents bought the business in the 1960s.

As the heir to the Monson baronetcy, Alexander was born into a life of privilege.

His paternal grandfather was Lord Monson, a Lincolnshire landowner and peer. He was a champion of personal liberties who later became president of the Society for Individual Freedom.

When the 11th baron died last year, the title passed to Alexander’s father, Nicholas John Monson, born in 1955.

It is believed Baron (Nicholas) Monson, a publisher, is currently in Kenya with his third wife, Silvana.

Last night the dead man’s grandmother, Lady Emma Monson, said: ‘I’m a widow myself. I’m bereaved. I’m now grieving for my grandson. I’m extremely upset and I just can’t talk about it.’

Kenyan Police said Mr Monson died in hospital on Saturday following his arrest.

Police spokesman Richard Mugwai said he had been in custody for just a few hours when he was rushed to hospital after starting to feel sick.

The officer said: ‘He was arrested outside a nightclub under the suspicion of having taken drugs.

‘We made preparations to interview and charge him but he then felt sick. We took him to the hospital and he died in the hands of the doctors.’

It is believed Mr Monson, who studied at London’s City University until 2008, entered Kenya on April 23 and was due to fly home on July 10.

Mr Mugwai, the commander of Kenya’s coastal Kwale County police division, said Mr Monson was taken to the police station under suspicion of having smoked bhang, a local variety of cannabis.

He was later moved to the nearby Palm Beach Hospital, where he died.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We have been providing consular assistance.’

Bhang is a natural drug made from dried seeds and leaves from the female cannabis plant. Its use originated in India and it is illegal in many countries. Popular on the backpacking scene, users often mix it with fruit or alcohol.

On his Facebook page, Mr Monson's father describes himself as ‘an enthusiastic cook, a relentless writer, an occasional poet, a passionate advocate, a wayward disciple of the teachings of Epicurus and the Stoics and a devoted Apostle of Alain de Botton’.

Last night a friend who knew the Monson family when they lived in Bampton, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It’s awful what happened, it makes me feel sick.

‘I heard he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly with a friend. The friend was released but apparently they found drugs on Alexander so he was handcuffed and taken.’
