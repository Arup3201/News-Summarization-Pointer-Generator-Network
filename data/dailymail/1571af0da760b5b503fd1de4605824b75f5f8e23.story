A businessman who lost £15,000 building his own private toll road has revealed how he only did it because his wife had moaned to him about traffic problems.

Mike Watts, 63, spent £325,000 on the toll road to bypass roadworks when a crucial route in Kelston, Somerset, was closed by a landslip, leaving locals with a 14-mile diversion.

His road closed last week after Bath and North East Somerset council invested £660,000 to finish repairs on the A431 five weeks early, meaning Mr Watts and wife Wendy Race, 52, will not make a profit.

Mr Watts came up with the idea of the toll road after he and Ms Race grew frustrated at having to undertake the lengthy detour to reach the stalls they run in the centre of Bath when the A431 closed for repairs

Mr Watts says he faced constant opposition from the local authority over the project, which he claims was down to officials' embarrassment that he was able to tackle the problem of the road closure - caused when cracks appeared in February.

He came up with the idea after he and Ms Race grew frustrated at having to undertake the lengthy detour to reach the stalls they run inside the Bath Guildhall Market.

'It all became a much more expensive project than we'd anticipated but we weren't put off because my wife was getting pretty annoyed,' he told The Times.

'Every morning I'd have to drive the car with her. She'd be shouting in my left ear that she doesn't want to go to work any more.' 

The A431 Kelston Road was closed in February after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road.

Friend and neighbouring farmer, John Dinham, was already allowing cars to use a track through his field, and Mr Watts agreed to rent the land from him until Christmas and build a road over it, hiring three workmen to help build the road in just ten days.

The toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit, which the couple thought was easily possible by Christmas as more than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month

Motorists were charged £2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings.

Mr Watts and Ms Race also put up a toll booth and paid attendants to collect the money, as well as shelling out for public liability insurance and CCTV, at a cost of around £150,000

They had also spent £150,000 to build the road, but Mr Watts says the council bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission for the project.

Mr Watts also claims officials had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official

But in September the council suddenly found a further £660,000 to complete the roadworks early and open the main road, meaning the toll road will be shut and the couple will just break even. 

Mr Watts also claims officials had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official, and the couple have accused Bath and North East Somerset Council of deliberately trying to bankrupt them.

In an open letter to the council, Ms Race said: 'The Kelston Toll Road is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in when the A431 closed way back in early February.

'We thought, stupidly with hindsight, that the council would be supportive. After all, we didn't want them to cough up any dosh for it – we wanted it to pay for itself.

'But we did hope and pray that they would see the practical benefit of the temporary road for ourselves and the thousands of people living this side of a closed road, and the other thousands of people that used that road to get to and from work every day.'

Ms Race added: 'We applied for retrospective planning permission because it was the right thing to do but I wish we never had. It has cost us a further £25,000 so far. Most recently they have dug up an archaeologist from somewhere.

'We have used our home as a guarantee for the costs of the temporary road, which was a decision we came to with our eyes wide open, but it seems to have fired B&NES up to do whatever they possibly can to escalate our costs, so that we do actually lose our home. They have even found another £660,000 to throw at the A431 to "speed up works".'

Bath and North East Somerset Council has denied trying to block the couple, saying last week that the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works.

It said in a statement: 'The council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and various officers and members have met with him several times.

'The Council has provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge.

'This road is open to the public and therefore, in the public interest, must comply with the normal safety standards for public roads.

'Councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £660,000 (for the A431 repairs) following further investigation works at the site, which discovered that below the land which had already moved, there was another layer of 'soft' rock, which was also at risk of sliding.

'The additional funding was needed for the necessary revised scheme which required two rows of deep piling to ensure that future land-slips are prevented.'
