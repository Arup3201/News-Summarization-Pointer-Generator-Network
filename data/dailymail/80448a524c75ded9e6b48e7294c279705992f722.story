The nation that departed the last World Cup amid calamity is quietly making its case as one of the prime contenders at this one.

France, who left South Africa in chaos, shame and recriminations after the squad mutinied against the manager, progressed to the quarter-finals yesterday against a spirited Nigeria team.

And while never sparkling, they were unfussily efficient, benefiting greatly from the 62nd-minute replacement of Olivier Giroud with Antoine Griezmann, which changed the attacking dynamic of the match.

And Paul Pogba, who has been under a degree of pressure, with some urging Didier Deschamps to drop him, demonstrated some of the reasons why Juventus will demand £60million for him should he be sold.

He hasn’t yet managed to be the midfield fulcrum for which the team yearn, but his headed goal after 79 minutes yesterday might yet make him the toast of France.

For Deschamps, it represented a degree
 of vindication. ‘Paul is young and I think it’s normal that he’s been 
criticised,’ said the manager.

‘It’s
 part of a high-level footballer’s life. Sometimes it’s painful, 
sometimes it’s unfair but it will toughen him up. And he stood up today 
and showed his potential.

'Maybe he played more simply than usually and all credit to him. I didn’t doubt his ability.’

Nigeria,
 who had initially looked the more vibrant and incisive of the teams, 
could count themselves a little unlucky, not least their impressive 
goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama.

He
 has been one of the outstanding players and characters of this 
tournament and his excellent form continued here at the National Stadium
 up until the 79th minute, when his handling error allowed Pogba to open
 the scoring.

‘I don’t 
know why he padded the ball from the corner,’ said his coach Stephen 
Keshi. ‘His decision is final and what happened, happened. It cost us 
big.’

Even France’s 
second — a Joseph Yobo own goal from close range, under pressure from 
Griezmann on 90 minutes — could have been dealt with better by Enyeama.

Didier Deschamps is unbeaten in 10 games hehas taken part in at the World Cup as playerand manager (W8 D2).

Still,
 though France weathered difficult periods, they were in control from 
the moment Giroud was withdrawn and Griezmann restored their attacking 
balance, with Karim Benzema moving into the centre.

In
 fact it proved an inglorious afternoon for the Arsenal striker, who was
 fortunate that the referee appeared not to see his elbow aimed at John 
Mikel Obi.

There was no 
mistaking who the locals wanted to win, with the  stadium echoing to 
chants of ‘Nigeria! Nigeria!’ and the small knots of French fans who 
tried to make their voice heard invariably provoking whistles. 

The
 Nigerians had insisted before the game that the dispute over 
£2.25million in bonus payments had been quickly forgotten and so it 
seemed as they started at a pace and with a degree of incision which 
suggested they expected to win.

Caught in the middle: Matuidi attempts to move forward but is surrounded by three Nigerian players

Strength: France striker Olivier Giroud holds off the challenge of Nigeria midfielder Ogneyi Onazi

Lost cause: Debuchy fails in his attempts to control the ball

Ahmed Musa —the two-goal star against Argentina —  Peter Odemwingie and Emmanuel Emenike all worried the French defence.

And
 it appeared the early pressure had paid dividends when Musa curled in a
 excellent  near-post cross which Emenike slid in to convert past 
Lloris.

However, referee Mark Geiger correctly ruled it out for a very tight offside.

Nigeria were dominant in  midfield, with Mikel and Ogenyi Onazi establishing control, and were quick going forward.

Onazi in particular was targeted, first by Pogba and later by Blaise Matuidi, whose challenge ended his match.

Keshi
 said: ‘On two occasions Onazi had very bad tackles and nothing was 
done. The referee was bad and this is the first time I speak about the 
referee as a coach.’

Committed: Matuidi comes in late to win the ball from Onazi and catches the Nigeria midfielder

That said, Keshi’s displeasure had partly been incurred by the  disallowed goal, a correct decision.

Though
 they were suffering, France had the best chance of the first half, 
Pogba exchanging passes with Valbuena and hitting a superb volley that 
flew straight at Enyeama.

Mathieu
 Debuchy should have done better on 40 minutes and Lloris was forced 
into a sharp save from Emenike’s strike as the half ended.

The
 pace waned after the break, yet Nigeria still made most of the running,
 with Odemwingie and Emenike keen to test Lloris from long range.

But Griezmann brought fresh verve. With 20 minutes left, he exchanged passes with Benzema, who shot at Enyeama.

The
 goalkeeper saved but the ball rebounded off the striker and headed 
goalwards until Victor Moses scrambled back to hook it off the line.

France suddenly looked the more dangerous side. Yohan Cabaye hit a delightful strike from 25 yards that rebounded off the bar.

Then
 came the Valbuena corner, which saw Enyeama flap and Pogba head home. 
France were in the ascendant and when Valbuena played in his cross and 
Griezmann pressured Yobo into turning into his own net, the game was 
already done.

The World Cup has lost another African nation but France, in undemonstrative style, make steady progress.
