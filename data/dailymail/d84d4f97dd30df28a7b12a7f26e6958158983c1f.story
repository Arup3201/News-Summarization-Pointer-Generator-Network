A police officer working for a school district in suburban Houston was charged with official suppression after he allegedly asked a woman to smell her feet during a traffic stop.

The woman filed a report claiming that on the morning of August 11, she was pulled over on Jones Road by Cy-Fair Independent School District Officer Patrick Quinn, 26, on her way home from visiting a friend.

Quinn stopped the motorist for driving with an expired insurance, but later told her that he could smell marijuana in her car.

The driver agreed to let Quinn search her vehicle, which allegedly yielded a marijuana grinder, Houston Chronicle reported. 

According to the complaint filed with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, the cop then asked the woman what she would do in his place, to which the driver replied that she would let him off.

In response, Officer Quinn confided in the motorist that he had a foot fetish and would let her go if she let him sniff her feet, according to the district attorney’s office.

As the woman was removing her boots and socks, Quinn made it clear that if he were to take a whiff of her tootsies, he would likely lick them as well.

As an alternative, Quinn told the driver she could give him her underwear instead.

The woman removed her intimates and made an attempt to hand the item to Quinn, but the officer apparently had a change of heart and let her go without getting anything in return.

Police identified Quinn as the officer behind the bizarre traffic stop from a fingerprint left on the driver's insurance card and charged him October 25.

Prosecutors with the district attorney's office believe that Quinn may have preyed on other women to satisfy his foot fetish and are asking drivers to come forward.

The Cy-Fair school district released a statement to Click2Houston Monday saying that Officer Quinn has been placed on an administrative leave.

‘We are appalled by the nature of the allegations brought forth against one of our officers,’ the statement read in part.

According to Quinn's Facebook page, the St Louis native has been married for seven years and has two young daughters.
