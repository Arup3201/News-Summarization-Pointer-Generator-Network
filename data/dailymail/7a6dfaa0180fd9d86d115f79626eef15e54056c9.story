A hybrid of table tennis and football, headis is a game that is catching on in its native Germany and beyond.  

Invented by Rene Wegner, and popular already in universities throughout his homeland, headis uses the tactics of tennis and ping pong with the primary skill, the header, borrowed from football.

The rules are similar to those in table tennis, with the same table used, but there are a few obvious exceptions. For one, instead of a small plastic ball and a paddle the headis ball is seven inches in diameter and weighs about 100 grams.

It is made out of rubber and has special bouncing qualities. Volleys are allowed as well as touching the table. A game is made up of two sets each to 11 points, and just like table tennis the set's winner must be leading by two points. 

According to Mr Wegner, 2,000 headis balls have been sold this year, compared to a 2013 total of 1,300, as more and more people give it a try.

The game is serious stuff - players launch themselves at shots, leaping onto the table in the hope of winning the point. 

Headis was invented in 2006 by Wegner, while he was a student at Germany's Saarland University.

It is now part of the sports programme in at least 15 universities in the country, and is creeping into the Czech Republic educational establishments.

As with any game, there's winners and losers; here are the victors from the Unna tournament

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal in September, Wegner said: 'In the beginning, people were like, what are you doing, you idiots?' recalled Mr Wegner.

But with a recent tournament attracting 100 competitors, being named a finalist in the international sports industry start-up competition and setting up a company in the headis name, this is one game that could certainly catch on.
