A woman dialled 999 and begged police to rid her bin of maggots fearing her neighbours were about to 'turn against' her, it has emerged.

The time-waster call to Greater Manchester Police, which lasted more than a minute, has been singled out as one of numerous mundane calls officers receive.

Despite the woman's persistence, a patient operator politely directed her to her local council, but not before the obviously upset caller had given her explanation as to why she needed the help of the emergency service.

The woman, who has not been named, dialled 999 and was recorded saying: 'Hello, well, I'm having problems in my house because there are some germs in my bin.'

When the operator asked her to clarify what exactly was in her bin, she replied: 'Maggots.'

'Maggots in your bin?' said the operator.

The caller answered: 'Yes and, well, 
it's becoming very serious and I'm scared if our neighbours are going to
 complain about it. I already tried to sort it out but no-one is able to
 help me.'

When 
the operator explained to her she needed to call the council, the woman,
 explained: 'Yes, but I'm scared the neighbours are going to turn 
against me because it's (sic) going to be affected.'

When
 the woman said she had already called the council only to be told they 
could not help her until Monday, the operator replied: 'They're the only
 people who can help you I'm afraid because the police don't sort 
maggots out.'   

Audio has also been released by Greater Manchester Police in a bid to tackle the issue of people dial the emergency 999 number inappropriately.

They say up to one-third of the 999 calls they receive should not have been made.

In another call, a man dialled 999 asking to be put through to the ambulance service because he needed some pregnancy pills.

'Hello, it's the police, can I help you, sir?'

'No, I don't need the police, sorry miss.'

'You phoned 999.'

'Yes, I asked to be got through to the ambulance, and he didn't hear me properly.'

'You wanted the ambulance; shall I take some details from you sir and call the ambulance?'

'I just wanted some pregnancy pills, that's all.'

'You want some pregnancy pills? '

'Yes, I just wanted some pregnancy pills, in'nit.'

'Yes, well you can't phone the ambulance for that I'm afraid, sir, you need to go into your local pharmacy or doctors' surgery.'

Meanwhile, South Yorkshire Police says a third of its calls are unnecessary and has urged people to think before picking up the phone.

Superintendent
 Adrian Moran, South Yorkshire Police's officer in charge of communications, said: 
'These might sound amusing but there is a serious point to this.

'While
 we are distracted with answering these calls we are not attending to 
other more important calls from the public which potentially could put 
lives at risk and reduce the service we provide and our response to 
incidents.'

Other examples include a frustrated television viewer who called because she could not find the movie she wanted to watch.

'Ridiculous': In one time-wasting phone call, a woman dialled 999 because she couldn't find the film see wanted to watch on Sky TV (stock image)

The Sky subscriber dialled the emergency services number to lodge a complaint when she could not find a particular film on the channel's movie box service.

Another woman dialled 999 because her daughter's hamster got 
stuck under the floorboards.

And another mother called because her son’s 
radio-controlled helicopter had crashed on a nearby shop roof and they 
needed help to retrieve it.

Police say these calls waste operators' time and prevent them from dealing with real emergencies.

Superintendent Moran added: 'If it is clearly not a police matter do not use us a directory inquiry or advice service. We will and regularly do prosecute callers who repeatedly abuse the 999 system.

'The simple message is you should only call 999 in an emergency when a crime is in progress, a suspect is nearby or life is in danger. For all other matters use the non-emergency number 101.' 

Other time-wasting calls the force has received include a neighbour complaining a couple next door were making love loudly with the windows open while a shopper dialled 999 because because a store would not exchange a pair of shoes she had bought.

Another parent even called 999 to ask if police officers could attend her home because her son would not eat his breakfast.

Operators also regularly received drunken phone calls from revellers asking for a taxi home.
