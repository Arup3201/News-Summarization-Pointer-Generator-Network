'I am sure there are brilliant teachers who are nuns': Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt was forced to admit he backed nuns as teachers

Labour's education spokesman yesterday refused six times to say nuns can be good teachers before finally admitting that they can do a ‘fantastic job’.

Tristram Hunt caused fury when he appeared to doubt their abilities during an appearance on the BBC’s Question Time last week.

Yesterday, he was repeatedly asked on the Andrew Marr Show whether nuns could be good teachers, but kept avoiding giving a direct answer until the host demanded for a seventh time that he answer the ‘very straightforward question’.

The former TV historian eventually conceded: ‘I am sure there are brilliant teachers who are nuns who are doing a fantastic job.’

Last week he was accused of ‘denigrating’ Roman Catholicism and being ‘ignorant’ and ‘arrogant’.

During a debate over Labour’s policy of requiring all teachers to have official qualifications, Mr Hunt clashed with Cristina Odone, former editor of the Catholic Herald.

The political commentator said some of her most inspiring teachers did not go to teacher training college and taught ‘real values’.

But Mr Hunt said: ‘These were all nuns, weren’t they? … I know about your religious schooling and there’s a difference, I think, between a state education system having qualified teachers in the classroom.’

Miss Odone later told her former publication: ‘Tristram Hunt’s comments on nuns last night were arrogant and ignorant. Why is it acceptable to denigrate anything Catholic but bleat tolerance about every other religion? 

'To know he and Labour stand a chance at the next election makes me fear for the 7,000 brilliant faith schools in this country.’ 

The shadow education secretary’s remarks led to outrage on Twitter. Tory MP Conor Burns wrote: ‘Absolutely shocking, sneering comments by Tristram Hunt about Catholic schools and nuns.’

Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride added: ‘My mum spent most of her career teaching in a convent school, working alongside nuns. They gave incredible educations.’

Nadine Dorries, a Tory MP, said it was an ‘arrogant, sneering, intolerant remark’, adding: ‘If Labour had any chance of holding on to its Catholic Glasgow seats, it lost it last night with Tristram Hunt’s remarks.’ 

Fellow Conservative MP Henry Smith pointed out that Mr Hunt had taught history in schools ‘despite not being qualified’.

Yesterday, Mr Hunt said: ‘If I offended nuns in any way, that certainly wasn’t my intention. My point was that we need a highly effective, qualified teacher cohort in our schools.’
