It is is the image that could dramatically improve your online dating.

Experts have analysed the online dating profiles to find out what works best.

The most effective keywords, they say, are surfing, yoga, skiing and the ocean.

The key to online dating:  A new study has revealed the top keywords, along with the best way to take a profile pic

The team also analysed the 400 most popular profiles, and found there were keys to which profile pictures worked best.

'If you’re a gay man, pose outdoors—48 percent of the profile pics of the most popular gay men on OkCupid were snapped outside. (It was 80 percent in Atlanta!),' the researchers said.

'Selfies are acceptable for women (45 percent of top-ranking straight women used them, as did 4 percent of lesbians), but not so much for men.'

The chart shows 380 of the top 1000 most commonly used words in profiles on OkCupid.

'Working with data crunchers at the dating sites, we analyzed the 1,000 most popular words on both men and women’s profiles, tabulated the most popular movies and TV shows, and crunched stats on what people consider their best feature vs. what features their potential dates are attracted to,' the team at Wired said.

A previously study found an outdoorsy full-length shot is best for men, while indoor body pictures get women 60% more message. The new study added that gay men enjoyed particular success with an outdoor shot, and that selfies were only acceptable for women.

'Mentioning cats is fine, but mention 'my cats' and you’re a weirdo.

'The data shows that lesbians appreciate nice legs, gay men prize nice arms, and straight women and men are looking for flat stomachs above all else.'

Why are outdoor photos of men likely to be more popular, but less so for women?

Men prefer indoor-selfies of women because they look pretty in them - the lighting is flattering and soft, and the whole mood of a home selfie is intimate and slightly private. It's sexy!Women prefer outdoors shots of men because they're likely to be taken by a friend (which shows that he's social and popular), and probably show him doing something active and rugged (which we also like).Why are profile pictures with more than one person in them a turn-off?

At match.com, we've found that people simply don't have time to study a photograph to work out which one is you! It's also far less intimate and attractive to use a group shot - always remember that the person viewing your profile will be trying to imagine themselves with you. Not you and your legions of friends.  It's the online equivalent of bringing your mates along on a first date. Why should you speak more about your own interests than what you're looking for in a partner?

Because people viewing your profile will be hoping to get a sense of your lifestyle - and how they can fit into it. They don't want to feel like an item on a supermarket shelf that you might simply pass by because it's not on your list.  Describe yourself as a person - how you like to spend your time, what you love to do. That's attractive. Why is spelling important?

Good spelling implies you're intelligent but more importantly it shows you've taken care and effort writing your profile. A hastily-written page full of abbreviations suggests you're not taking it seriously, or that it's something you flung up online while you were bored. That suggests you won't take dating seriously either. Good spelling shows that you are thoughtful and considered.
