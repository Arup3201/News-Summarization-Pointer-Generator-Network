Promising Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Macey continued his sharp rise up the ranks, after taking his place on the substitutes bench for the visit to West Brom on Saturday.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger continues to battle through an injury crisis for the Gunners and his options in goal have taken a hit in recently.

22-year-old Emiliano Martinez has taken over the gloves with No 1 choice Wojciech Szczesny out with a hip injury whereas summer signing David Ospina is still a long term absentee.

Macey, in action for Arsenal's Under 21 side last season, has made a quick impact at the Gunners

Where has Macey come from?

The 6ft 6in agreed a three-year deal with Arsenal after a trial last summer, snapping him from Bristol Rovers.

What's his first-team experience? 

Macey only made his squad debut as an unused substitute for Bristol Rovers against Torquay in March 2012 but never made a professional appearance for the Conference side.

Has he represented Arsenal yet?

The Englishman started 15 games for the Under 21 side last season and managed to hold down the starting spot. However his appearance on the Arsenal bench at West Brom on Saturday was a first.

Macey, in training with the first-team, has quickly risen through the ranks at Arsenal due to injuries

Was he destined to be a Gunner?

Perhaps a coincidence but this is not the first time Macey has played for a team called Arsenal. The 20-year-old played for a local side in Bath called Avon Arsenal Comets when he was a kid, who even had a cannon in their emblem.

Has it always been so promising?

Arsenal's promising keeper was originally rejected by the Bristol Rovers' Centre of Excellence in 2007. However he didn't give up and turned out for Bath City and Yate Town before eventually joined the centre in 2009. he then became a full-time scholar in May 2011.
