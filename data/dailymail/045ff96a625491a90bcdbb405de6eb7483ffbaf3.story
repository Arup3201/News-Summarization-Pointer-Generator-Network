A mews house in South Kensington, 1963. George Dyer, a petty criminal from the East End of London, drops through the skylight and into a room filled with vast canvases and half completed pictures of naked men and screaming popes.

Paint pots and piles of paper scraps carpet the floor. The walls, a makeshift palette, are daubed with gashes of colour – shocking red, pale pink, livid blue. It is the dead of night.

A man emerges from the doorway. ‘You’ve got two choices,’ he says matter-of-factly. ‘I can call the police or you can come to bed with me.’ It is Francis Bacon.

George chose the latter option. And so began a near decade-long love affair between the small-time burglar and arguably the greatest British painter of modern times.

This week, one of Bacon’s many tributes to George, Portrait Of George Dyer Talking, is expected to become the most expensive single portrait ever auctioned when it  goes on sale at Christie’s in London on Thursday.

It is thought the 6ft-tall 1966 oil painting – believed to be being sold by Mexican financier David Martinez Guzman – will fetch up to £40million.

It follows the sale of Bacon’s triptych of portraits of fellow artist Lucian Freud, which also set a new world record for an art auction when it fetched £89million last November.

Even by the standards of the art world, the latest portrait will set a new reference point – the Beckhams recently paid £40million for their seven-bedroom mansion in London’s exclusive Holland Park.

Portrait Of George Dyer Talking is one of the most famous images of Bacon’s lover, a man the artist immortalised on canvas but destroyed in real life.

Despite his upbringing on the fringes of the criminal underworld – he was a minor associate of the Krays – George was a fragile young man who was fundamentally ill-equipped to cope with the painter’s cruel brilliance.

He committed suicide in Paris in 1971 on the eve of Bacon’s retrospective at the Grand Palais – an honour that had only ever been awarded to one other artist, Picasso.

The show included the portrait, which last appeared on the open market in 2000, when it sold for $6.6million (£4million) at Christie’s in New York.

It was then believed to have been acquired by Martinez in a private sale for $12million (£7.3million) more than five years ago.

Last night, a member of George Dyer’s family spoke for the first time about the artist who some hold responsible for his lover’s death.

The relative, a woman in her 80s, who asked not to be named, said: ‘George’s family thought Bacon was a degenerate man and wanted nothing to do with him.

'He was not liked by the family because we thought he was an awful man. He was horrible.

‘I suppose we had nothing in common with someone like Francis Bacon. But the dislike of him was because of the sort of person he was. That feeling has never changed. Even now, I don’t want to talk about him.’

Bacon, who died in 1992 aged 82, was an alluring but dangerous figure.

Michael Peppiatt, author of Francis Bacon, Anatomy Of An Enigma, who was a friend of Bacon, said: ‘Francis was mesmerising, an electrifying presence.

'He was hugely seductive, intuitive, enormously clever. He had this desire to devour people.

‘It was an animal thing. George couldn’t read and write. Someone quipped he learnt how to write when Francis gave him a cheque book.

'George was rather kind, docile even, and that was the problem. Bacon wanted a tough lover who could make him suffer because he was masochistic.

'George was more than 20 years younger and he was too gentle, too nice, even though he came from that background.’

Nevertheless, George became Bacon’s greatest muse. He painted him more than any other person. Through Bacon, George became someone but the psychological impact on him was devastating.

Peppiatt said: ‘Someone once said to me, “I can’t think of a worse fate than to be loved by Francis.” Because he left you no air to breathe.

'Bacon gave George an existence but he was absorbed by him. Francis wasn’t a monster. He was caring but he pushed himself to the limits and so he’d do that to other people, too.’

George took refuge in drink and he and his relationship with Bacon began to disintegrate. By the time of the Paris retrospective, they were no longer together.

The artist had grown tired of his lover but as he was the inspiration for so many paintings in the exhibition, he felt  it was only right he should be there – as long as he remained sober.

Instead, George began drinking the moment they arrived. The day before the exhibition, he was found slumped on the lavatory, with an empty bottle of barbiturates on the floor. He was 36.

Bacon was devastated. Peppiatt said: ‘He kept coming back to Paris, even booking into the same hotel. It was as though he needed to be near the scene of the death, to plumb the depths of his feelings and sensations.

'He told me, “There’s not an hour goes by that I don’t think about George and feel profoundly guilty.” ’

Bacon poured his grief into his work, obsessively painting George for years after his death. He had other relationships but no one ever affected him in the way George had.
