If he helps England to an unlikely victory at the World Cup in Brazil, he’ll be hailed a hero.  

But even then Premiership star Adam Lallana might struggle to mend fences with his neighbours.

For the Southampton midfielder has angered locals by illegally building a £40,000 all-weather football court in his back garden.

Knockabout: England footballer Adam Lallana faces 
having to knock down this £40,000 football pitch built in his back garden 
because it doesn't have proper planning permission

Complaints: The pitch also doubles as a basketball court but neighbours have complained about the height

The AstroTurf pitch – complete with 
high black fencing and basketball hoops – is intended to be used for 
‘knockabouts’ with his young family, he has claimed.

The 26-year-old married his long-term partner Emily Jubb in December and they have a son, Arthur, who is almost two years old.

But neighbours are worried that it will be used for noisy matches in a designated Area of Special Local Character.

The
 row began when Lallana – who is in Miami as England prepare for 
tonight’s warm-up match against Ecuador – submitted a planning 
application in December seeking retrospective permission for a separate 
children’s wooden play area in his garden.

In this application, his planning agent said he also planned a ‘small AstroTurf pitch’.

Family: Lallana, 26, is married his 
long-term partner Emily Jubb (pictured). He planned to use the astro 
turf pitch for 'kickabouts'
 with his young family. The pitch cost between £40,000 and £60,000 to build

Brian
 Riley, who lives next door to the £1.5million, five-bedroom house near 
Ringwood, Hampshire, said what was built was more like a large council 
leisure facility.

Mr Riley, 
who has lived with his wife Constance at their home for more than 20 
years, said: ‘We didn’t object to the application, why would we? We 
understand kids need somewhere to play.

‘But
 then we saw builders and welders arrive on site and we couldn’t work 
out what was going on. We saw this sports pitch being built and we just 
couldn’t believe it.

‘The 
council enforcement officer told us it was more in keeping with a 
council play park than a garden in a Special Character Area, which this 
is.’

Neighbour: Brian Riley, who lives next door to Mr 
Lallana’s £1.5 million five bedroom house said he is concerned about the
 prospect of noisy sports matches

Planning officials 
found the height of the games area – and in particular the basketball 
hoops and backboards – was beyond permitted development rules and 
required planning consent.

Lallana,
 who earns about £50,000 a week but has been linked with a big-money 
move to Liverpool this summer, will either have to adjust the dimensions
 of the games area or submit a retrospective application for 
consideration.

Mike Hirsh, a
 planning consultant acting for Lallana, said: ‘The area of hard 
standing to be used as a knock-about pitch has been agreed by East 
Dorset District Council as “permitted development” and does not need 
planning permission.

‘Over 
the small goal areas, fencing has been raised to support a basketball 
hoop. Technically that part needs planning permission as it is more than
 two metres in height.’

But the construction has been built without proper planning permission

@highlight

The midfielder must now apply for retrospective planning permission

If that fails he may have to demolish pitch - which is also a basketball court
