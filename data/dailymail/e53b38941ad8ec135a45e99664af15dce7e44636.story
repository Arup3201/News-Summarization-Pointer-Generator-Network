Bayern Munich goalkeeper Pepe Reina has urged David de Gea to stay put at Manchester United despite interest from Real Madrid and says he is one of the 'top goalkeepers in Europe'.

De Gea, who made his move to Old Trafford in 2012 from Atletico Madrid, initially struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League but has become one of Louis van Gaal's most consistent performers this year.

His form over the last two seasons, where he has produced a number of spectacular individual displays, has resulted in a potential move to Real Madrid as a replacement for Iker Casillas.

But former Liverpool star Reina, who has struggled for game time in Germany, says de Gea should stay put in Manchester despite the potential of moving back to Spain.

'He is one of the top goalkeepers in Europe and this year he has been superb,' Reina said on talkSPORT.

'Maybe Real Madrid are looking for a goalkeeper and De Gea is one of the names suggested, but I think he should be happy enough to play for Man United.'
