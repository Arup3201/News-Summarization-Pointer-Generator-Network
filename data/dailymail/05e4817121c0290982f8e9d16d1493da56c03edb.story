Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel dramatically upgraded the U.S. government's estimation of the threats America faces from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on Thursday, saying its jihadi network represents 'an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.'

ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel told a group of reporters during a joint press conference he held with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey.

'They're beyond just a terrorist group.They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' 

'And the only way you do that is that you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and – and – and get ready.'

Grave threat: Secretary of Defense Chuck hagel and Chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey at the press conference where they delivered the dire warning

Not just airstrikes: Hagel and Dempsey said that much of America's long-term involvement in Iraq will continue to consist of assistance to Iraq's nascent government as it trains volunteers like these Shi'ites, who have joined the battle against ISIS

Battling ISIS 'is going to be a very long contest,' Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned on Thursday

'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.'

Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there.

'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said.

'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.'

At the same time the decorated general cautioned that the 'required participation' of the U.S. would remain one of coalition leadership 'to provide the unique capabilities that we provide, but not necessarily all the capabilities' – a suggestion that an unlimited release of military might to crush ISIS is off the table.

Dempsey added later in the briefing that ISIS can't practically be contained in Iraq, since it also has deep roots and tremendous resources across the Syrian border.

Forget about Bowe Bergdahl: State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday that the US does not 'make concessions to terrorists' – including the payment of ransom for the safe return of kidnapped hostages

The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' the general explained.

'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.'

Hagel fielded a question about whether future U.S. military action could include a direct focus on Syria, answering: 'We continue to explore all options.'

As American military action expands in Iraq, he said, much of that help is in the form of 'a tremendous amount of military assistance to the Peshmerga through the Iraqi security forces.'

'There's no question that we have been accelerated – as a matter of fact, all year long, we have been accelerated – [through] all the requests made by the Iraqi government for lethal assistance and equipment, and we continue to do that. 

He downplayed the long-term strategic value of the limited airstrikes that President Barack Obama has authorized, saying that in the long term they could be just a table-setter.

Defeating ISIS 'isn't going to just come as a result of airstrikes,' Hagel said. 'Strategically, there are limits to how much you can accomplish with airstrikes. Tactically, you can accomplish a significant amount. I think we've seen that.

'ISIS will only truly be defeated when it's rejected by the 20 million disenfranchised Sunni that happen to reside between Damascus and Baghdad,' he explained.

'It requires a variety of instruments, only one small part of which is airstrikes. I'm not predicting those will occur in Syria, at least not by the United States of America. But it requires the application of all of the tools of national power – diplomatic, economic, information, military.'

Hagel and Dempsey also discussed a failed mission to rescue American photojournalist James Foley and other ISIS hostages this summer.

An ISIS militant with a British accent beheaded Foley this week in a shocking video that rocketed across the Internet, blaming Obama for airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq.

Earlier on Thursday, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters that winning Foley's return by paying off ISIS was never an option, and that 'the U.S. Government did not have contact with' ISIS after a warning came that Foley would be killed if airstrikes continued.

'We do not make concessions to terrorists,' she said. 'That includes – we do not pay ransoms.'

'One of the main ways ISI[S] has been funded throughout this conflict has been from ransom payments that others have paid. We believe just in 2014 that that’s in the millions of dollars.'

End of the world: The terror group 'has an apocalyptic end-of-days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey explained

'So we believe that paying ransoms or making concessions,' Harf said, 'would both put our – all Americans overseas – at greater risk for kidnapping and in harm’s way, but that ransoms would also fund and finance exactly the groups we are trying to degrade their capabilities.'

Harf did not address the recent return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban forces, which was achieved through a prison swap that required the release of five high-value Taliban Islamists from the American military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The Obama administration seems to be treating ISIS as a completely different animal.

'This is not about ISI[S] versus the United States,' Harf said Thursday.

'They are killing anyone who gets in their way – Sunni, Shia Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, Iraqis, Syrians – anyone who gets in their way, and now an American. So this is not about what the United States is or isn’t doing. This is about ISIL’s stated commitment to murder, rape, enslave people who don’t agree with their ideology.'
