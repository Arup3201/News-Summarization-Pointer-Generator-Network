Plush situation: Hubert Joly of France has been named Best Buy's new CEO and will receive a $6.25million payment package if he can't get a visa

Struggling retailer Best Buy Co, which is engaged in a takeover battle with founder Richard Schulze, has chosen a new chief executive to lead the company.

The company has tapped Hubert Joly, the former head of global hospitality company Carlson and turnaround expert, as the nation's largest consumer electronics chain's new CEO and president.

Controversially, the 53-year-old French mogul will receive a payout of $6.25million, even if he cannot secure a visa to work within the states.

John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, told NBC News that Joly may be assuming a risk leaving Carlson.

The corporate governance specialist added: ‘I can understand some payment but this does seem a windfall.’

However, a Best Buy spokesperson said that Joly's compensation is commensurate with his experience.

They told NBC News: ‘This package was developed in consultation with leading search and compensation firms and is in-line with best practice for Fortune 50 companies.’

Joly's base salary, $1.175million, is modest for a CEO, but the news organization says that his pay check could be fattened by possible stock options, and is cushioned with a very generous $20million signing bonus.

Struggling: Best Buy's stocks have been weak in past weeks after Former CEO Brian Dunn resigned amid an investigation into his relationship with a 29-year-old employee

News of Joly’s lavish deal comes amid Best Buy’s worst
quarter in recent memory. It suspended its profits forecast after reporting a
dramatic 90 per cent drop in net income in the quarter ending August 4.

The electronics chain earned $12million in this period,
compared to $150million only a year earlier.

The poor report comes after a turbulent period for the
retailer, which began with the resignation of CEO Brian Dunn in April amid a
company investigation into an 'improper' relationship with a 29-year-old female
employee.

There was more bad news for Best Buy when the recent
announcement of Mr Dunn's replacement was met with a negative response on Wall
Street.

The company's announcement, made Monday, comes 
after the ailing retailer said Sunday that its offer to advance talks 
with company co-founder Richard Schulze on his takeover bid was 
rejected.

Best Buy says Joly, who is French, is expected to take over as CEO in early September when his visa is secured. Carlson, which operates such businesses as Radisson and T.G.I Friday's, announced Sunday that Joly resigned from that company.

Investors may have also been disappointed that Best Buy didn't pick a retail executive.

‘Joly is a rogue agent,’ said Brian Sozzi, analyst at research firm NBG Productions. ‘He comes in and fixes companies and then leaves.’ He added that investors won't learn of a new turnaround plan until after the holiday season.

Joly succeeds Mike Mikan, a board member who has served as interim CEO since April when former CEO Brian Dunn left Best Buy because of what the company called an improper relationship with an employee.

‘Hubert was an outstanding candidate for this position and I am confident he will be a great fit for Best Buy,’ Hatim Tyabji, chairman of Best Buy's board, said in a statement.

The contract gives Joly, a French citizen, $6.25million even if he can’t secure a work visa. But the deal also includes a $20million signing bonus, a base salary of $1.175million, and as much as $8.75million in salary for the upcoming fiscal year.

He would also be able to acquire stock options.

Altogether, this would make the CEO worth nearly $32million.

According to the Wall Street Journal, this is two and a half times what Best Buy earned in the last quarter.

‘Hubert's range and depth of 
experience in transforming companies is exactly what the company needs 
at the moment, as is his energetic, imaginative and experienced 
leadership in executing strategies.’

Over the past 15 years, Joly has 
developed a track record of successful turnarounds and growth in the 
media, technology and service sectors, Best Buy said.

In the media sector, Joly led the 
restructuring and growth of Vivendi's video game's business, now part of
Activision Blizzard, from 1999 to 2001.

He later oversaw the 
integration of Universal and Vivendi's media assets in the U.S. and was 
then part of the team that led the restructuring of Vivendi in 2002 to 
2004.

In the technology sector, Joly spearheaded the turnaround of EDS, now part of HP, in France from 1996 to 1999.

In the service sector, he has led the
transformation of Carslon Wagonlit Travel into the global leader in 
corporate travel management.

In 2008, he became the CEO of CWT's parent,
Carlson, based in Minneapolis, whose brands employ more than 170,000 
people in 150 countries.

As
CEO of Carlson, Joly spearheaded a strategy to bolster the company's 
leadership position across its businesses, including its restaurant 
division with more than 900 T.G.I. Friday's restaurants and its hotel 
division with more than 1,000 hotels around the world.

Best Buy is trying to avoid the fate of 
its rival Circuit City, which went bankrupt in 2009, partly because of 
changing shopper habits.

Best Buy has been shrinking store size and focusing on its more-profitable products such as mobile phones. It's also trying to combat the so-called ‘showrooming’ of its stores — when people browse at Best Buy but purchase electronics goods elsewhere, especially online.

In March, it announced a major restructuring that includes closing 50 stores, cutting 400 corporate jobs and trimming $800 million in costs.

Dunn left in April amid an investigation that he had an improper relationship with a 29-year-old female employee. Since that departure, interim Mikan has made strong statements about how he plans to restructure the company, focusing on services and revamping stores.

In early July, Best Buy said it would lay off 600 staffers in its Geek Squad technical support division and 1,800 other store workers.
