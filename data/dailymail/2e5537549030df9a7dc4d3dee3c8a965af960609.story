At an hour long, the State of the Union is a good chance to catch up on some shut-eye.

Or at least Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg thought - because it appears she nodded off during Obama's address on Tuesday night.

Cameras caught the moment that the 81-year-old justice's head dropped just after 10pm as the president neared the end of his speech, which clocked in at 59 minutes and 57 seconds.

Ginsburg, who has been caught snoozing at speeches in the past, was saved by colleagues Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy, who repeatedly tried to keep her awake.

Having a snooze: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg apparently fell asleep during the State of the Union address on Tuesday night - leaving her colleague Anthony Kennedy, left, to give her a nudge

Struggle: Ginsburg, 81, apparently battled to keep her eyes open during the almost hour-long address

Kennedy elbowed her at one point, the Washington Post reported, while Breyer nudged her as many as eight times and repeatedly looked at her to make sure she was awake, it added.

But their quick-thinking didn't stop viewers spotting her apparent snooze.

'We are all Ruth Bader Ginsburg now,' conservative blogger Michelle Malkin wrote on Twitter. 'zzzzzzzzzzzz.'

Writer Marc Wilmore said: 'Last person to leave the chamber please place a blanket over Ruth Bader Ginsberg before turning the lights out.'

'Ruth Bader Ginsberg was not napping!' comedy writer Caissie St Onge added. 'She is very small and that statement necklace is heavy!'

Before the speech, Ginsburg had looked excited to be there.

Joy: She was seen giving President Obama a big hug before he climed to the stage to give his speech

Fan: Obama greets Ginsburg, whom he once called 'one of my favorite people', on Tuesday night

When Obama approached the stage ahead of his speech, she embraced him in a tight hug.

'She is one of my favorite people,' the president told The New Yorker in 2014, after she was taken to hospital for a blocked artery.

Ginsburg, the oldest sitting judge on the Supreme Court, was appointed as a Supreme Court Associate Justice by President Clinton in 1993.

After her heart surgery, she dismissed suggestions she should step down.

'Anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they’re misguided,' she told Elle.com.

'As long as I can do the job full steam… I think I'll recognize when the time comes that I can't any longer. But now I can.'
