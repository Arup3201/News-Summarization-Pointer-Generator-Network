Allan Ellis shot himself dead just hours after being told he was to be sued over his debts, an inquest was told

A game hunter shot himself dead just hours after being told he was to be sued over debts of up to £40,000, an inquest heard.

Allan Ellis, of Bacup, Lancashire, forwarded an email to his wife Heather which had warned him of pending legal proceedings - and accompanied the online message with the remark: 'That's it then.'

Later, after the former Scots guard had returned home, he took a licensed rifle from his gun cabinet and held it to his head in front of Mrs Ellis, an inquest was told.

Police negotiators were called to the scene, but the 50-year-old shot himself following a four-hour stand-off at his rural terraced cottage during which officers made repeated attempts to talk him out of it.

An inquest in Burnley, Lancashire, was told Mr Ellis, a former corporal who served in the army between 1980 and 1993, was a 'very proud' man who was determined to be the main breadwinner in his family - despite suffering a military injury which left questions over whether he would ever walk again.

He had 'a real passion for the countryside' and had thrown himself into the gaming business firstly in Durham and then Waterfoot, Rossendale.

Mr Ellis dealt in venison, rabbit and wild game, shooting produce and then selling it at markets and farmer's markets. 

He also organised deer hunts, shooting events and ran a catering stand at food festivals.

He was a registered firearms holder for several years and despite temporarily losing his licence in 2011, he legally kept a number of guns in his cellar and gun cabinet, needing a variety of weapons for 'corporate customers to shoot with'.

But business became tough for Mr Ellis and he had to hold down two jobs after the first game business in Durham went under in 2007/08.

As his first business debts mounted, he was 'increasingly affected' and rather than declare himself bankrupt, entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement in 2009 before a repayment programme was set up.

A friend then helped him to secure a job in Leeds and he was financed by a friend to open a game shop in Lancashire in 2012.

In a statement, Mrs Ellis said former comrades of her husband believed he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder following his stint in the army - but he refused to discuss it because he felt treatment might affect his gaming career.

Mr Ellis would spend 'every spare minute' at the second business and was 'burning the candle at both ends' but he failed to keep up with the administration work of the business and slid into debt. 

After Mr Ellis (pictured) had returned home, he took a licensed rifle from his gun cabinet and held it under his chin as his wife looked on in horror, an inquest was told

In early 2014 it became apparent that his business was having an adverse effect on him and he began to lose weight, the inquest was told.

Mrs Ellis said: 'He was a very proud man. He felt as if he should be the main breadwinner and felt he should be earning more money. 

'I knew he desperately wanted to avoid failing again in his business but I never thought this would happen. 

'He spent all his time and energy trying to make it work but to no avail. He had a problem with the website.

'He was pouring a lot of money into that, the difficulty was it never went live but was paying the designer as he was designing. He was constantly paying out money, shop rent, utilities. It seemed a lot of things were going against him at the time.

'I was quite happy that he was working so hard. He was so determined he wanted it to work, but he spent long hours in the shop.'

On the evening of his death he returned home from his daily commute to Leeds and on to his own shop but 'was in a funny mood' according to his wife.

She said he had received an email that day from the web company notifying him that they were to issue proceedings against him for money they claimed against him.

He forwarded the email onto his wife adding, 'that's it then'. 

Upon his return home that night at around 10.30pm he went to bed but had got up quickly and gone downstairs. 

Mrs Ellis said she had heard the sound of the gun cabinet open and, concerned, she called her sister Denise McGowan.

As she spoke with her sister, Mr Ellis returned upstairs with a Bolt Action rifle and placed the barrel under his chin before saying to her, 'I want you to see this'. 

She said she tried to get him to speak to Mrs McGowan but that he threw the phone on the bed. 

Mrs McGowan told her sister to leave the house and she alerted the police.

Police negotiator Sgt Nick Hills of the Intelligence Unit said that on speaking with Mr Ellis just before midnight he had appeared 'very polite' and 'didn't express any anger'. 

A hearing at Burnley Coroner's Court (pictured) heard how police negotiators were called to the scene, but the 50-year-old shot himself following a four-hour stand-off

He said: 'He was very calm and deliberate in what he was saying. It made me feel that he had a settled intention.' Sgt Hills said that Mr Ellis also said, 'I don't want to burden you'.

'He accepted that if he were to walk out of the incident he would lose his firearms which would massively affect his business. He quite clearly had it (gun) and wouldn't put it away.' 

He was said to have told officers that if anyone was to go in to the house he would shoot himself and dismissed available options. At 1.45am he ended the call and attempts to reach him proved unsuccessful.

At 2.30am on the morning of August 14 a gun shot was heard in the house and officers found Mr Ellis dead in a bedroom. Toxicology reports concluded there had been no drugs or alcohol.

Coroner Richard Taylor in concluding a verdict of suicide said: 'You have told me a story about a proud, private controlled man, desperate and determined to provide for his family and to succeed in his business. 

'He was adamant in his conversations with Sgt Hills and once he made that decision it was clear there was no going back. His guns were his life and career, if he lost them again it would be forever and he couldn't bear the thought of that.'
