West Ham could be denied European football in their final season at Upton Park by the ill-discipline of their Premier League rivals in the knockout rounds of this year’s continental competitions.

The top three nations in UEFA’s Respect and Fair Play rankings qualify for a Europa League place ahead of next term.

England were third behind Republic of Ireland and Holland before the latter stages of the Champions League and Europa League resumed this month.

Sam Allardyce's West Ham are currently top of the Fair Play table but could miss out on the Europa League

West Ham are two points ahead of Burnley and Liverpool in the Premier League Fair Play rankings

R/Y: Red & yellow cards, P/P: Positive play, R/O: Respect towards opponent, R/R: Respect towards referee, B/O: Behaviour of officials, PTS: Points, AVG: Average  

Were they to stay there then the Premier League would award a Europa League place to the team which tops their own Fair Play table.

That is currently Sam Allardyce's West Ham, who sign off from Upton Park after 112 years before moving to the Olympic Stadium at the end of next season.

Fulham qualified via the same route in 2011 and took their place in the inaugural Europa League.

Burnley currently trail the Hammers by 2.25 points, which are awarded for disciplinary record, positive play, respect towards opponents and referees and the behaviour of team officials.

The ill-discipline of other Premier League clubs could harm West Ham's chances of a place in Europe

The UEFA Fair Play rankings show England in third place behind the Republic of Ireland and Holland

But sources at the Premier League believe there is a danger they will lose their extra Europa League spot given the combative nature of knockout-round ties.

UEFA – who take into account all international and club matches in their competitions - use the same criteria as the Premier League but also include the behaviour of fans in the stadium.

That has not been an issue for English clubs of late but on-the-pitch misdemeanours could make a difference when UEFA’s final table is published in May. For example, Manchester City had Gael Clichy sent off during Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat to Barcelona.

Next season is West Ham's last at Upton Park after 112 years, before they move to the Olympic Stadium 

On the other hand, were a Premier League club to go on and win the Champions League or Europa League playing attacking football and avoiding too many cautions, then England could yet climb UEFA’s table.

Meanwhile, it is Liverpool and Manchester City who occupy third and fourth positions respectively in the Premier League standings.

Were they to finish top then the Europa League place would go to the next team who had not yet qualified for European competition.

However, given that entry is at the first qualifying round – which begins on July 2 - clubs can refuse the offer. In this instance the association would lose their extra allocation.

As from 2016/17 there will no longer be a Europa League prize for the top three nations. Instead, a financial bonus will be paid to the best Fair Play association, the most improved and the nation with the best behaved spectators.
