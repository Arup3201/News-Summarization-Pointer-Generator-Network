Westboro Baptist Church may have gone too far this time.

Known for taking outrageous stands against just about any topic, the fundamentalist church made famous for saying God hates gays has drawn increasing ire for praising the Arizona wildfire that killed 19 firefighters and announcing it will picket their funerals.

In separate tweets, WBC thanked God for the fire and also said they would picket the funerals of the 19 heroic firefighters who lost their lives fighting the blaze.

Awful: Westboro Baptist Church praises the Arizona fire and vows to picket the deceased firefighters' funerals

‘Praise God-a consuming fire! No #SSM, rebels #WBC2PicketFunerals #DOOMEDusa,’ read one tweet.

‘Westboro Baptist Church THANKS GOD for AZ fires that killed 19 firefighters!’ read another tweet, complete with a fire breathing thank you graphic.

Repulsing: WBC sent out a second tweet praising the fire, this one complete with a blazing graphic thanking God for the fires

Taking it a step further, WBC then tweeted a press release praising God for the fire. ‘God sent the Arizona wildfire! Revere and honour him… not those vile human creatures!’ As if that wasn’t bad enough, the realse also said that they dead firefighters are in hell and pleading for God to send WBC to picket their funerals.

Even more outrageously, a WBC spokesperson took to Twitter to call the fire a ‘marvelous work of God’ that makes WBC ‘bow in humble thanks and praise to God!’

Reaction on Twitter to these proclamations was annoyed, to say the least. Some people warned WBC not to set foot inside Arizona, while others called them trash. The spokesperson’s tweets were made with degrading comments about a child she allegedly had out of wedlock.

Horrible: WBC sent out a third tweet, this one calling the Arizona wildfires a 'marvelous work of God'

Tragic: These are the 19 firefighters killed June 30 in the Arizona wildfires, whom WBC said are burning in hell begging the church to picket their funerals

Recent WBC ‘protests’ have been met with aggressive counter-protests and have even been turned into fundraisers, according to media reports. This may not be necessary in Arizona though, the state passed a law in 2011 that makes it a criminal offense to picket within 300 feet of a burial site, reported the Arizona Republic.

Though WBC's website has a fairly robust list of planned protests, not a single one of them happens to be firefighter's funeral in Arizona.
