There is a contentious agenda at Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, which starts at 11.30am. You can follow the main talking points as they are debated, with SAMI MOKBEL in attendance at the Emirates Stadium.

The AGM has had a familiar theme over the last 10 years: patience. Chief executive Ivan Gazidis was preaching that message yet again earlier this week ahead of the meeting - so Gunners fans couldn't be blamed for thinking it was Groundhog Day.

Arsene Wenger's men won the FA Cup in May, ending their nine-year trophy drought, but there have been few signs this season that Arsenal are ready to mount a serious challenge for the Premier League title or the Champions League - Wenger's holy grail - despite the summer signings of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. 

Gazidis is set to issuer a similar speech at Thursday's AGM, but whether the club's loyal fans and ambitious shareholders are ready to accept the endless calls to wait remains to be seen. 

Host commentator

SAMI MOKBEL: It's all over for another year. Phew! It was all very civilised in the end.

Now it is time for questions from the floor: 'Were there funds available to strengthen the defence. If so why weren't they spent?'

Keswick: 'It's not my wish to double guess what Arsene Wenger wants to do. Arsene Wenger calls the shots on football.' Wenger then declines to explain why he hasn't signed a defender since Thomas Vermaelen exit.

And why does Wenger never use a 4-4-2 formation, a system which provided him with the most success in the early part of his Arsenal career?

Wenger: 'It's about balance. We have many creative players through the middle. So it's difficult to find a balance between attacking and defending.

In Europe it's difficult because you can't lose a midfielder. But you will certainly see it during the season, maybe when Giroud is fit.'

Gazidis is then asked for his opinions on an overseas Premier League game. 

'We have never asked for that,' Gazidis said. 'But the Premier League should not rest on its laurels. All avenues should be explored, but it's far too early to make a judgement on an overseas game.'

Question about the diversity of the Arsenal board. It's currently all male and white.

Keswick: 'We will worry about the diversity.'

Gazidis is then asked about the London living wage: 'Policy on wages is to give out workers attractive rates of pay. They are all about statutory rates. The issue is subject of debate, this is a matter for government and we will abide by the decisions they make.'

Gazidis is then asked about safe standing: 'We are open to safe standing, but it's a matter for the authorities.'

And then why the club have big cash reserves which are not being spent on transfers.

'The topic is far more complex than has been reported. We do try to keep a reasonable amount in reserve and a reasonable amount for transfers.

We don't publicly disclose the amount we do have in reserve. But it's untrue to say we are sitting on cash we don't want to use.'

The cost of travelling to away games is then put to the Arsenal board... 

Gazidis said: 'We realise the high cost of travelling to away games. Each club have their own ticketing policies, and we are an attractive proposition for clubs. We will be providing away fans with a £10 refreshment club voucher over the Christmas period.'

Question about the succession planning for Wenger's departure:

Keswick said: 'I don't comment on other clubs, good luck to them and their problems. Think that talk is premature, but we follow the situation very closely. This club will always be attractive for the best managers in the world. But we are keeping an eye on it.'

And here's more from Wenger on the club's transfer policy: 

'We won the FA Cup with a difficult run, but we managed to deliver the trophy and it makes us stronger, more confident and I believe we will have a strong season.

We bought good players, I believe we've done remarkably well in the transfer market. We wanted one more player, but couldn't. We will try to rectify that in January.

We have a good core of young British players, who feel the value of our club. Slowly the modern game has lost that.

So we need your support again. I encourage you to be behind us. You are magnificent. And I'm sure we will come out this season more united and stronger.'

And now we here from Arsene Wenger, who recently celebrated his 18th year in charge of the club.

‘This is always an important part of my season, I know you are ambitious, critical and sceptical, but you are very loyal. And I'm very grateful to see the same faces because we love this club. I know I don't always please you like I love to, but we give it all to make you happy.

Let’s remember last season we started with a home defeat and I felt a little tsunami around the club. There was pressure for us to sign players and scepticism. We showed we were united, together and ready to work hard.

What has changed compared to a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices. We signed Ozil which gave us comfort. We made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that.

It was extremely paradoxical. When we lost, we lost [heavily]. We lost five or six. If you concede the first goal in a big game 85 per cent of the time you will lose the game.'

Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke has taken to the floor:

'We are proud of what we've accomplished. What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.'

SAMI MOKBEL: The formal business of these AGMs are always mind-numbing but essential. Deloitte re-appointed auditors. Josh Kroenke appointed to the board.

We start with a question concerning the £3million fee paid to Kroenke Sports Enterprises that was highlighted in recent accounts. 

Sir Chips Keswick answers: 'The fee was proposed by the myself and Lord Harris for the services of Kroenke Sports Enterprises. There was no competitive tender for this process as it was directly available to us and would have been inappropriate.'

On this very day a decade ago, Arsenal went a 49th game unbeaten with a 3-1 victory against Aston Villa - the final match of their unbeaten run 

‘At the time when you do it, it just looks normal and natural,' said Wenger earlier on Thursday.

'When I look back at the photos today and I see the quality of each player, I think that’s where you realise that it was an exceptional team. Not only those who played regularly, but also those who were on the bench.

'It had never been done in the Premier League until then and I can’t remember anybody winning the championship without losing a game. I’m very proud of that because there’s not a lot of room to do better. Apart from that, the quality of the players I had was absolutely exceptional.’

Come on, Arsenal fans, we want to hear from you. What should Wenger, Gazidis and Co be saying today? Send us a tweet and we'll get the best opinions up on the site... 

Back to Twitter and Santi Cazorla, one of the Premier League's smallest players, has revealed he can walk under team-mate Per Mertesacker's legs without ducking. 'It's easy for me because he's so tall,' Cazorla says. 'He's a great guy.'

Stay tuned for more ground-breaking revelations…

And now, for the first time today, we cross over to our man reporting at the Emirates Stadium. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me the great pleasure to introduce Mr Sami Mokbel.

'Anticipation building here in the Woolwich Suite at the Emirates Stadium ahead of this year's AGM,' Sami reports. 

'The FA Cup win should take the edge off things, but it still could be feisty. It kicks off in 10 minutes or so.'

While we wait for the AGM, a selection of Arsenal players have been answering questions sent in by the club's fans.

Mathieu Flamini has described Gunners legend Dennis Bergkamp as Arsenal's finest player and revealed Tomas Rosicky is his best mate at the club: 'I've known him for 10 years now and I know everything about him... including his secrets!' Oo-er. 

Arsene Wenger has completed his morning press conference and will join members of Arsenal's board for the AGM, which begins at 11.30am.

The Frenchman has revealed that defender Laurent Koscielny is out of Saturday's home clash against Hull City, along with Mesut Ozil, who has a knee injury.

But better news comes in the form of Aaron Ramsey, who is expected to be back in action at Anderlecht in the Champions League next week.
