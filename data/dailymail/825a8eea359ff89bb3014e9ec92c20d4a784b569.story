Tennis ace Jamie Murray has said not enough has been done in Scotland to cash in on his brother Andy’s on-court success.

Jamie, 28, hit out at the lack of facilities being built to bring youngsters through the ranks in this country following Andy’s grand slam wins.

Former Wimbledon and US Open champ Andy, 27, is Britain’s No 1 player while Jamie lifted the Wimbledon mixed doubles title in 2007.

He wants to see more being done to improve the grassroots standard in the wake of brother Andy's success

Murray also wants to see an improvement in facilities and questioned why so little has been done

But Jamie has taken to Twitter to serve up a scathing broadside against sporting body Tennis Scotland.

He said: “It’s so disappointing that nothing has been done to capitalise on Andy’s success and grow tennis in Scotland. Once in a lifetime opportunity!

“You need vision and strong leadership to grow the game. Great to have role models but your only as good as your grassroots. So frustrating to see.

“Only two indoor courts built in past six years! And member of admin staff promoted to head up performance. What is going on at top of the tree?”

Jamie’s stinging words come soon after Tennis Scotland president Ian Conway and his deputy Jacqui Duncan quit due to concerns over the recruitment process for staff.

Lee Bouchar has recently been installed as interim head of performance at Tennis Scotland and will oversee a full review of management structures over the next six months.

Plans to build a multi-million pound tennis and golf super-centre in between Murray’s home town of Dunblane and Bridge of Allan were lodged in July.

The proposed development is backed by Murray’s mother Judy and Scottish golfing legend Colin Montgomerie.

Tennis Scotland and the Lawn Tennis Association have also voiced their public support for the new centre.

Jamie married his Colombian girlfriend Alejandra Gutierrez in 2010 in the Cromlix House hotel - the Dunblane property later bought by Andy.

Andy acted as best man and the brothers kept in Scottish tradition by wearing their family kilts and sporran.

The Great Britain tennis squad are set to face the US in the Davis Cup in Glasgow next year.

It is thought the GB team will feature Andy.
