More than three dozen people dressed in black and grey arrived at the landmark cemetery, where Walker's framed portrait has been set on an easel.

A pair of guards in white short-sleeve shirts, black berets and white cloves stood watch during the ceremony.

A green tent has been set up to shield the guests from the afternoon sun - and from the eyes of curious passersby. 

The family reportedly were hoping to keep the event private and is said to have asked those in attendance to arrive and leave together so they can be accompanied by a security escort.

Ahead of the somber ceremony, Paul Walker's father, Walker Sr., was photographed driving his white KIA SUV towards the site of the burial.

A slew of celebrities are buried at the iconic Hollywood Hills cemetery, most notably Michael Jackson's tomb at Forest Lawn's Great Mausoleum.

Other stars laid to rest there include Liberace, Lucille Ball, John Ritter and Brittany Murphy. 

According to RadarOnline,
 the Fast & The Furious star was transferred from the mortuary at 
Los Angeles cemetery Forest Lawn Memorial Park to a crematory in 
Glendale, California on Thursday.

A source told the website the family 'intends on dividing Paul's ashes between an urn and keepsakes.'

Walker was killed last month when the Porsche he was traveling in crashed and burned in Santa Clarita.

On Wednesday, Walker's father, Paul Walker Sr., brother, Cody Walker, 25, and other family members finalised plans for the actor's funeral service. They also walked around the grounds of the cemetery, choosing a grave site plot.

His family will mourn the star in a very private service, though TMZ reported certain cast and crew from the 'Fast & Furious' movies will be invited because he considered them kin.

The
 Walkers are keen, however, to avoid throngs of media and fans, to 
protect the actor's daughter Meadow, 15, who is 'broken up' over her 
dad's death.

Earlier 
this week, the family claimed plastic road markers may have been 
responsible for the crash that killed the star after stunt experts 
claimed the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT driven by Walker's friend hit the 
markers, called Bott's Dots, and careered out of control. 

According to TMZ,
 sources close to his family said that having visited the site, the 
experts claimed the bumps may have caused the car to hydroplane, 
resulting in the driver losing control.

Walker and driver Roger Rodas died on November 30 when their car hit a pole and tree and caught fire in the Los Angeles suburb.

The
 experts told the family that the car could have lost traction after 
hitting the bumps, which are used to separate lanes of traffic, and 
skidded off the road.

The claims come after question marks were raised over the safety of the car itself following the crash.

The Porsche was being driven by the Hollywood star's friend and business partner Rodas.

It
 has since emerged that car experts have long expressed concern about 
the souped-up model's suitability for the road, due to its ultra light 
carbon-fiber frame and 5.7 liter race-derived V10 engine.

It has a flat out speed of 205 miles per hour and its design is derived from earlier Porsche Le Mans models.

Porsche knew of the car's sensitivity 
when they launched the model in 2004.

According to TMZ, a memo 
circulated to sales staff said of the GT Carrera: 'This vehicle cannot 
drive over a Foster Beer can that is lying on its side.'

'You need to be aware of what type of road surface you are on (dips; pot holes, seam heights, etc.)

'The Carrera GT is as close to a racecar as we will ever get, this car has all the disadvantages of a racecar.

Police have revealed that a second man
 has been charged with stealing a piece of the wreckage of the Porsche 
that Walker was a passenger in when he was killed.

Anthony Janow, 25, was released on $60,000 bail following the charges.

Prosecutors say that Janow and 18-year-old Jameson Witty stole a roof panel from the wreck as it was being towed away from the site.

The pair could face up to four-and-a-half years in prison for the offense.

Witty, who is also free on bail, was caught on video stealing the T-top roof of the Porsche right off the tow truck and afterwards he even bragged about the heist by posting pics of the stolen wreckage on Instagram.

The wrecked Porsche Carrera GT was being hauled by a flat-bed tow truck hours after the wreck that claimed the movie star and friend Roger Rodas, who was driving the vehicle when it crashed.

The tow truck stopped at a red light and a male jumped out of a car following it to grab a piece of the car – he then hopped back into his car and sped away, according to police.

The tow truck driver immediately reported the theft.

A search warrant was executed on Thursday, and police found the stolen car panel - a part from the sports car's roof.

Witty has since taken to Instagram to apologize for his actions. 'I wanted to say my intentions for the piece I took off the two truck were to make a memorial out of it. Paul was a childhood idol to me and many.

The investigation into the crash that killed both Walker and Rodas is still ongoing.
