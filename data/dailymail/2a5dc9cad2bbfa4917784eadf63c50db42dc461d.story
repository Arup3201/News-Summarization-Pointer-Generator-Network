The head of AEG Live told a jury that he believes a lawsuit filed by Michael Jackson's mother against the concert promotion company was a baseless extortion attempt.

CEO Randy Phillips also said Tuesday that the company bears no responsibility for Jackson's 2009 death, as his mother contends.

Katherine Jackson is suing AEG Live LLC for $40million, claiming it failed to properly investigate the doctor who was later convicted of her son's death. AEG denies wrongdoing.

'Shakedown': Michael Jackson's mother has been accused 'extortion' over the lawsuit

Phillips said he agreed with statements attributed to him and defense attorney Marvin S. Putnam that the case was a shakedown.

'Yes or no, answer? Yes,' Phillips said in response to a question by Katherine Jackson's attorney Brian Panish.

Phillips is the highest-ranking AEG executive to testify in the case, now in its sixth week.

He will likely be asked about numerous
emails he sent and received about Jackson's health in the final weeks 
of the superstar's life, as well as any interactions he had with former 
cardiologist Dr. Conrad Murray.

Murray agreed to serve as Jackson's 
doctor for $150,000 a month while he performed 50 shows titled 'This Is 
It' in London's 02 Arena in 2009 and early 2010.

AEG denies hiring Murray and agreeing to pay Murray's fee as an advance to Jackson.

Phillips' testimony came after several
days of often tense testimony from AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware, 
who told jurors he did not remember numerous details about Jackson's 
rehearsals and emails he sent about the singer.

Panish sparred with Gongaware, and pointedly questioned Phillips, whom he called to the stand as a hostile witness.

Trial: The Jacksons are suing AEG, contending the company negligently hired and supervised Conrad Murray, the doctor who administered the fatal dose of propofol to Jackson in June 2009.
