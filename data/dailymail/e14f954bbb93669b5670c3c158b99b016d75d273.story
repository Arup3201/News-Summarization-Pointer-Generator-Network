The mother of a young girl who was attacked by a neighbour’s dog has criticised police for refusing to get involved - because it happened on private land.

Amaia Hawker, four, needed 16 stitches on her face after suffering deep cuts just centimetres from her eye when she was savaged by a Leonberger dog which belonged to the next-door neighbour of a family friend. 

Amaia's mother Laura, 33, said she was distraught that police can't take action as the incident happened on private land.

'Distraught': Mother Laura Hawker, 33, says she is distraught that police can't prosecute the dog's owner as the attack happened on private property

Under the current law, the owner cannot be prosecuted because the attack in Redfield, Bristol, was not in a public place.

But this is due to change to include incidents on private property in just a matter of weeks.

The attack took place last week when Ms Hawker, who works as a carer, was visiting a friend and the neighbour was invited into the garden where Amaia was playing.

Although the dog is not a dangerous breed, it lashed out and attacked the little girl.

Amaia needed eight stitches on her lip, five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek

Ms
 Hawker, who was in the kitchen of the property at the time, said: 'The 
dog came into the garden through the back entrance with the owner.

'It walked past my daughter and just bit her in the face. The owner dragged it away. I picked her up and she was screaming.

'I grabbed a tea towel to stop the blood. I was just shouting for help.'

Owner Ian Parsons said: 'I had the dog right next to me. The child just barged past the dog and poked it in the eyes and it defended itself.

'It is not a dangerous dog. It may growl sometimes but has never attacked anyone and is friendly.'

Paramedics arrived at the house to treat the girl before taking her to hospital for eight stitches on her lip, five stitches under her eye and three more on the side of her cheek.

The police were also called but Ms Hawker said she was distraught to find out they may not be able to prosecute over the attack.

Under current law a dog owner can only be prosecuted if their dog is 'dangerously out of control' in a public place

New laws due to come into force before the summer will extend the rules to include private property.

In this case, if the criminal investigation is dropped the family may be able to take up a civil case against the dog’s owner.

Avon and Somerset Police said: 'We are carrying out an investigation. We have had no previous incidents reported to us involving this dog.'

Law: Amaia's family could take up a civil case if the criminal investigation is dropped
