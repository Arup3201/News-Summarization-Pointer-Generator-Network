This is the moment a groom-to-be gets harnessed up, blindfolded and tricked into thinking he's going bungee jumping before being thrown into a lake.

Australian YouTube user IRoughyI uploaded a video showing  Luke the bachelor falling hook, line and sinker for the prank.

The first time he's encouraged to jump his nerves get the better of him, until the countdown begins again and he unexpectedly belly flops into the murky water instead of free falling through the sky.

Bungee fail: This is the moment a groom-to-be gets harnessed up, blindfolded and tricked into thinking he's going bungee jumping before being thrown into a lake

Caught on camera: Australian YouTube user IRoughyI uploaded a video showing Luke the bachelor falling hook, line and sinker for the prank

As he plunges headfirst into the lake with his arms stretched wide, the blindfold comes off and Luke sees his surroundings for the first time.

After rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings, he turns around and swims back to the concrete jetty he 'jumped' from.

'I was so convinced, I was actually getting excited,' he exclaims as he's hauled out of the water by his amused friends.

Still smiling: 'I was actually getting excited,' he says as he's helped out of the water by his amused friends

His ankles remain tied together and the body harness intact, in true bungee jump style. 

Some of the bachelor party are seen videoing the stunt on their cell phones while others stand howling with laughter.

They said that Luke had 'no idea' what was happening when he was led down to the water's edge. 

To date the video of him in action has scored more than 200,000 hits.
