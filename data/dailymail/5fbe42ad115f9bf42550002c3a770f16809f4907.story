A Canberra public servant has argued for her right to longer breaks so she could travel to a cafe that served organic coffee with soy milk after her boss warned her about her absence at work.

Following the warning, the Australian Taxation Office administrator fought back by issuing a complaint to the federal government's workplace authority but it was dismissed.

After the case was thrown out, Pardeep Sidhu went on stress leave and claimed workers compensation for an 'adjustment disorder' which she said began once her supervisor approached her,The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Ms Sidhu  issued an appeal with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that was rejected after finding the supervisor's correct in her dealings with the Executive Level 1 public servant.

The tribunal found that the supervisor, Sky May, kept to workplace guidelines but Ms Sidhu argued that her boss tried to intimidate her after she applied for study leave that was rejected.

'The tribunal accepts this was a case in which there was a breakdown of the relationship between supervisor and employee, and this adversely affected the level of trust between the two and led to a considerable amount of hostile action by both,' tribunal member Robin Creyke said. 

'The evidence does not support the multiple claims that the administrative actions, as a result of which Ms Sidhu suffered an adjustment disorder, were unreasonable.' 

The tribunal heard Ms Sidhu now works in another area of the Australian Taxation Office and has  recovered from her adjustment disorder.
