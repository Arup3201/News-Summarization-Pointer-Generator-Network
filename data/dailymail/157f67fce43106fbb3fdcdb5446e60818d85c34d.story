Migrant camp: A Romanian is moved on from Park Lane as police crackdown on UK gypsies

Police have travelled to Romania to discourage young men from coming to Britain and committing crime.

In an unprecedented operation, Scotland Yard sent a ‘police mission’ of officers to rural northern Romania.

The trip was designed to help stem the flow of low-skilled migrants who see London and similar cities as attractive destinations.

Officers warned Romanians that if they arrive looking for jobs on the black market they are likely to be exploited or become victims of crime.

But there is also evidence that many of those who come to Britain end up committing petty crimes such as begging and pickpocketing – sometimes recruited by organised gangs who ‘employ’ them to shoplift, steal and rob.

The police operation came after a raid on the derelict ground of Hendon Football Club in North London. Officers discovered that almost every rough sleeper in the squat was from the same remote part of Romania.

One man told BBC’s Panorama that up to 400 people had left his village in the Carpathian mountains for London. He said they were prepared to live in grim camps for the chance of illicit building work where they could earn up to three times their usual wages.

Chief Superintendent Adrian Usher told the programme the message to Romanians was that they should not travel to Britain unless they can support themselves.

‘What I’m saying is that we know that if you come to the UK without a named job to go to, then you’re at really increased risk of being exploited or being the victim or perpetrator of crime,’ he said.

‘We’re here to protect all the residents of London and that includes those people who come to London looking for work.’

In an unprecedented mission, officers warned civilians of rural Romanian towns to be careful about migrating

Increasing: The number of Romanian immigrants, some pictured here in London's Marble Arch, is rising

Last week the Daily Mail revealed that Romanians are arrested at seven times the rate of Britons in London. And Romanian immigrants account for more than 11 per cent of all foreign national offenders – despite making up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

This placed the eastern European nation at the top of a ‘league table’ of foreign suspects, followed by those from Poland, Lithuania, India and Nigeria.

The troubling figures were uncovered by police analysts just weeks before restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians living in Britain are lifted on January 1.

They also discovered that eastern European offenders are more likely to be involved in low-level offences. Last year, Romanians accounted for nearly half of all arrests for begging in the capital and 34 per cent of pickpocketing arrests.

Many live in makeshift camps across London, including Marble Arch and Park Lane, where efforts to move them have failed repeatedly.

The Met has already brought a team of police from Romania and Poland to London to tackle crimes committed by their fellow nationals.

There are concerns that gaps in cross-border intelligence checks are allowing prolific and dangerous offenders to slip through the net.

Around 70,000 foreign nationals are arrested in London every year – about 28 per cent of all criminal suspects taken into custody.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said changes to legislation will allow border officials to stop people coming to Britain to sleep rough or beg.

‘We’ve removed some of those people before and one of the weaknesses at the moment is that they can come back and we can’t stop them,’ he said.

Romanian Ambassador Ion Jinga said: ‘We are totally against any type of crime committed by Romanians. We have a zero tolerance on any type of crime.’ He added that Romania has ‘one of the lowest rates of crime in Europe’.

Susan Hall, leader of Harrow council, said: 'The reality is nobody knows how many Romanians and Bulgarians are coming and that is deeply unsettling for councils.

'People who come here to work are welcome but January the first shouldn't be the starter's pistol for local authorities to be deluged with people they can't cope with.

'We are already seeing the effects of some criminality linked to Eastern Europeans seeping out to the suburbs - and that ranges from prostitution to pick pocketing and beds in sheds overcrowding. This has long since ceased to be just an inner city issue.'
