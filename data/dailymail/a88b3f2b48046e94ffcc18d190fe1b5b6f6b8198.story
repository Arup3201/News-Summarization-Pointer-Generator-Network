Britain's athletes prospered at the European Championships and Commonwealth Games but you have to look further for one of the sport’s best tales.

Thomas Somers, a 17-year-old former England youth rugby player from Yorkshire, ran 20.37sec in the 200 metres heats at the World Junior Championships in Eugene, Oregon in July. The only man faster at that age? Usain Bolt.

Of course, ‘the next Bolt’ tag is overused and unfair, and Somers has his head screwed on the right way to know that. Speaking during a free period at school, he is humble, bright and driven to succeed.

Only Usain Bolt was faster at 17 in the 200m than British sensation Thomas Somers

‘I’m still trying to get my head around it, it’s all a bit weird,’ he said. ‘It’s such an accolade, it’s something amazing that I don’t think I’ll ever forget.

‘The moment they told me about Bolt my face gleamed with joy and I said, “are you serious?”’

Somers finished seventh in the final the following day, but the schoolboy’s semi-final time, joint-second with DaBryan Blanton’s 20.37sec in Austin in 2001, has given him even more hunger to reach the top.

He doesn’t mind the Bolt tag. ‘I don’t think I’ve got used to people saying it, it’s such a good thing to be called. It’s such an honour to be up there with him.

‘It’s unbelievable to be classed in the same bracket as the fastest man in the world. To say that I’m second on the all-time list to him is amazing.

‘He’s definitely somebody I really look up to and appreciate everything he has done for the sport; the times he’s run, his technique.’

Bolt’s time of 20.13sec in Bridgetown in 2003 remains out of reach, but Somers’ bright future is testament to his intriguing story.

He quit rugby having played in Leeds Carnegie’s academy, and even appeared for England Under 16s northern side at the Wellington Festival last year.

It was a tough decision but his love for running started at an early stage in his life. From the age of four until 11, he ran 1.5-mile and three-mile fun runs while his parents did the 10k events. But he loved the rugby too and it took the intervention of another sprint sensation to make his mind up.

His decision was thanks partly to the advice of Adam Gemili.

In Mannheim, Germany, in the summer, the two exchanged words. Somers had previously sustained a broken wrist playing for his school team, and Gemili, European 200m champion, further encouraged him to stick to the track rather than the wing.

‘He basically told me I shouldn’t be playing rugby,’ recalled Somers. ‘He used to play football for quite a long time — he said that I’d get injured and spoil my chances and the times I’ve been achieving. It’s been good advice so far!

‘Once I broke my wrist I gained Futures Programme funding, which coincided quite nicely and now I just focus on athletics.

‘Rugby is a team game, athletics is obviously more individual, but I liked the competitiveness of both.’

The Futures Programme is a British Athletics-run scheme directed by double Olympic high jumper Jo Jennings aimed at getting more Union Jacks on the podium.

It helps with everything from equipment to travel to general advice, and has got Somers this far.

But what’s next? He will be 19 when the Rio Olympics comes along, but his goals for that and beyond show his ambitious side. ‘Over the next two years, I’d like to keep improving at the same rate and I’d like to go to Rio in 2016.

‘I think it could be achievable, but my main goal is London 2017 (World Championships).

‘Next year I’ll be trying to qualify for the European Juniors and try to pick up my first international medal. I’ve been to two international events and have made the final, but haven’t come away with a medal. That’s definitely the aim.’

His main goal is to represent Great Britain at the 2017 World Championships in London 

Somers has the winter to improve, while keeping more than a keen eye on his studies at Queen Ethelburga’s School in Harrogate, where teachers give him extended deadlines when he has important races coming up.

‘There are a lot of decisions about where I want to go and what I want to do,’ he said.

‘I’ve got quite a few universities in mind, such as Bath, Loughborough, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, but it’s all about getting the grades before I can make those decisions.’

One thing is clear, the Bolt tag has no danger of catapulting his feet off the ground.

Thomas Somers is supported by British Athletics’ Futures Programme for 2014-15, which provides targeted support for young athletes and their coaches.
