A roundabout in a quaint country village has been crowned the best in Britain after it was identified as the only one in the country to boast its own duck pond.

The idyllic traffic island in the village of Otford, near Sevenoaks, Kent is also only circular junction in the UK to have been granted listed status.

It was spotted by roundabout fan Kevin Beresford, who travels the country to judge entrants in the competition.

Winner: The picturesque Otford junction, above, scooped the 'Roundabout of the Year' prize thanks to its unusual duck pond

Kevin, who is president of the Roundabout Appreciation Society admitted he travels the length and breadth of the UK seeking out the best circular roads that Britain has to offer.

He described the winning roundabout as 'bizarre' but declared his love for the five-exit junction because of its classic green appearance.

He said: 'I love this roundabout because it is so quintessentially English.

'I have travelled from Land’s End to John O’Groats looking at roundabouts and thought I had seen them all, but I’ve never seen one with a duck pond before.

'Normally I describe a roundabout as an oasis on a sea of asphalt but this has turned that statement inside.

'We’ve got an island made up of water surrounded by land, which is bizarre.'

The pretty pond, which is circled by willow trees, is thought to date back to Anglo Saxon times, when it was possibly used as a drinking hole for local livestock.

In 1951 it was repaired by villagers for the Festival of Britain and in 1960 a duck house was placed on the pond, which is fed from a spring by the village station.

The pond was granted grade two listed status in January 1975 after plans to concrete it over were met with protest from villagers.

In 2008 the pond, which forms a natural roundabout in the centre of the village, was repaired and strengthened after the toll of years of heavy traffic going around it.

Parish council chairman John Edwards-Winser said he was 'thrilled' the village roundabout had won the award.

'Otford is a beautiful place to live and the duck pond is the jewel in our crown. It’s a talking point and everyone who visits the village stops to look at the pond roundabout as it’s totally unique.'

'It doesn’t matter which way you drive into the village, you’re greeted with outstanding views.

Runner-up: This junction at Chepstow racecourse came in for a notable mention but pipped at the post in the best roundabout stakes

'A lot of work goes into keeping the duck pond and it even has its own pond keeper.

'The pond is a real source of pride for the village. Sometimes you take these things for granted but every once in a while something like this happens to remind you how lucky you are to live here.'

Previous roundabouts to be awarded the society’s accolade are the BFI Imax roundabout in London, the Shepherd and Flock roundabout in Farnham and the Holgate Windmill roundabout in York.

The award means the roundabout will now feature on the front cover of the Roundabout Preservation Society’s 2014 calendar.

Other roundabouts given a notable mention in the enthusiasts list of Britain's best included a junction outside Chepstow racecourse, the BFI IMAX roundabout in London and the Pagoda roundabout in Birmingham.
