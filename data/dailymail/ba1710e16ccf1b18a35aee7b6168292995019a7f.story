Hazard, Suarez, RVP... IN. David Silva? Go on then. There's £100million to spend.

And if your picks are on the money you can once again win big in MailOnline's fantasy football game.

Even though the deadline to be in with a chance of securing the £1million prize has passed, there is still £60,000 to be won in other prizes.

The overall winner scoops £40,000, with smaller prizes for the runner-up and third place.

Meanwhile, there are 10 Manager-of-the-Month prizes worth £1,000 and 
even a £1,000 'Golden Boot' award for the team that scores the most 
goals. There's also a £4,000 prize pot for the highest average scoring 
mini-league at the end of the season.

You might even have an advantage by starting a little late - click here to find out why.

You can still pit your wits against former Liverpool, Tottenham and England midfielder, and Sportsmail columnist, Jamie Redknapp.

Jamie has picked his side and it will be automatically placed into all mini-leagues for you to compete against.

Main men: Will you select Eden Hazard or splash the cash on Robin van Persie? The choice is yours...

Sportsmail will be bringing you a weekly fantasy football column to help guide you
 through the season, with hints, transfer tips and other advice. Plus, players will receive regular emails detailing their weekly scores.

It looks easy, doesn’t it? Jose Mourinho can do it, David Moyes can do it – Manchester City will be hoping Manuel Pellegrini can, too. We all think we can pick the right team and now you can prove it.

I’ve going picked my team in MailOnline’s brilliant new Fantasy Football game – and you can go head-to-head with me.

But when it comes down to it, do you pick RVP or Luis Suarez? Can you afford Gareth Bale? And what about the new boys in the Premier League, like Paulinho or Fernandinho? Do you go for goals with David Luiz in defence, or stay a little more solid with Vincent Kompany?

I’ve studied the transfers and the stats to pick my fantasy squad. You can test yourself against me by entering my team in your mini-league. Fancy your chances?

There’s a £40,000 prize for the top manager at the end of the season. Plus there’s a £1,000 bonus for each Manager of the Month so it’s well worth tinkering through the season.

Get thinking, get researching and register your teams NOW!

Good luck,

JAMIE
