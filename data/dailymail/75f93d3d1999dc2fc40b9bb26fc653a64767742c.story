A young mother suffered a massive stroke after she was wrongly sent home from hospital because there were no specialists on duty over the weekend to assess a brain scan.

Ruth Stanton was aged just 30 when she was admitted to hospital after suffering two mini-strokes over 48 hours.

Doctors carried out two brain scans, but failed to give her a diagnosis because it was a Friday evening and the specialist neurologist was not on site.

Before: Ruth Stanton on her wedding day to Kerry before she suffered a stroke aged 30

After: Mrs Stanton, from Bognor Regis, following her stroke. Now 36, her husband says she is still learning to speak again after being left permanently brain damaged. The stroke could have been prevented by an aspirin

Instead they sent the mother-of-two home without treatment and that night she suffered a massive stroke in bed.

Her husband, Kerry, 47, discovered his wife, who worked in a building society, slumped on the floor of their bedroom, unable to speak or move.

Mrs Stanton, whose two children Caelan and Safiya were aged just five and one when the stroke occurred, suffered permanent brain damage.

She was unable to speak and is still learning to read and write again. She also has short-term memory problems, suffers from depression and is unlikely to ever work again.

Last month (March) the couple were awarded a six-figure sum in damages following a seven year fight for justice.

But Mr Stanton, an executive chef, said that no amount of money could compensate for how his family life had been irrevocably damaged by the blunder.

Mr Stanton said: ‘Ruth changed overnight from a happy, vibrant, independent woman to a shadow of her former self and our family life will never be the same again.

Happier times: Mrs Stanton was a 'bubbly, vibrant character', before she was struck down by her stroke, according to Kerry

‘The stroke destroyed Ruth, she  is a former grade A student but now everything is a struggle. She has had to learn to speak again and still has difficulty talking. She can’t sit and read the children stories, or help them with their homework and our seven-year-old daughter is teaching her how to read and write.

‘Despite this, she can understand everything that’s going on, which is very frustrating for her. She suffers from depression and has talked numerous times of not wanting to be here anymore.’

Mrs Stanton, a keen horse rider who visited the gym several times a week, suffered the first mini-stroke while visiting her mother, Rosemary Francis, 61,on November 15 2006.

While waiting for a blood test at her GP surgery the following day she suffered another small stroke and the decision was made to go straight to Worcester Hospital.

She was admitted and underwent a CT scan, then an MRI scan the following day.

However, medics failed to make a diagnosis and instead said they wanted a specialist neurologist, who was not at the hospital, to take a look at the scans.

Because it was a Friday evening the specialist wasn’t available and, although the scans showed signs of abnormality, medics made the decision to discharge Mrs Stanton, who was told to wait for an out patient’s appointment, instead.

She returned home and went to bed but suffered the stroke in the middle of the night.

A medical expert provided evidence to the couple’s solicitor that prescribing a simple dose of aspirin for Mrs Stanton, now 36, would have prevented it occurring.

Mr Stanton, of Bognor Regis, West Sussex, added: ‘If the hospital had given Ruth aspirin and monitored her effectively the stroke would have been avoided.

‘The sad truth is if Ruth had suffered her mini-strokes on a Monday she would probably had better care because there would have been more doctors and more specialists on duty.

‘Unfortunately, Ruth was sent home on a Friday night because the doctors knew nothing could be done over the weekend. ‘We put our trust in those doctors and unfortunately they let Ruth down.

Worcestershire Acute NHS Trust has agreed to pay the family a six-figure compensation package after a seven-year battle

‘Instructing solicitors was never about getting compensation, it was about getting some answers for Ruth. As it turns out we now know that someone didn’t do enough for her, which doesn’t make it any better or give her any closure.’

Tests later revealed Mrs Stanton was suffering from Takayasu's arteritis, a rare disease caused by the inflammation of the walls of the largest arteries in the body, which makes sufferers more susceptible to strokes.

She has been treated with aspirin on an on-going basis and has not suffered another stroke since.

Dr Solomon Almond, a consultant physician, provided evidence on Mrs Stanton’s care for her legal case.

He said: ‘There was a failure to recognise the signs of stroke and to appreciate the initial scan findings. Mrs Stanton was initially discharged without any treatment and it is likely aspirin would have been beneficial.’

Sue Taylor, a medical negligence lawyer at JMW Solicitors, who represented Mrs Stanton, said: ‘This is an absolutely tragic case of a young woman with a loving family who has been struck down in her prime.

‘The quality of care provided to sufferers can mean the difference between a full recovery and permanent disability, so it is absolutely vital that the NHS is making sure its healthcare staff are able to provide fast diagnosis and treatment.’

A spokesman for Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said the hospital was ‘pleased’ a settlement had been reached with Mrs Stanton, but added: ‘The Trust has made no admission of liability.’
