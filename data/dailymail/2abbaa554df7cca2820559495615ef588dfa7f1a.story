Ex-Everton boss David Moyes has been catching up with one of his former players over in America.

The Scot, who left the Blues to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United following 11 years service at Goodison Park, posed for a picture with former Everton talisman Tim Cahill, who is now playing in New York.

Posting a picture of the pair on Instagram - which will bring back great memories for Evertonians - Cahill said on Friday evening: 'Amazing to catch up with a true gentleman of the game on and off the park.

'Will never forget the day he brought me to Everton and the amazing 8 years we had at EFC.'

Also tweeting the snap on Twitter, Cahill added: 'My man David Moyes. Great to catch up in New York. Respect.' 

Moyes took Cahill to Everton in a £1.5million deal from Millwall during the summer of 2004 as the Toffees, tipped for relegation, went on to achieve the unthinkable by finishing fourth in the Aussie's debut season with the club.

Arguably one of the best in the air, the midfielder's aerial prowess petrified Premier League defences as Everton's  No 17 became famed for his headed goals.

Cahill went on to spend eight years on Merseyside before moving to Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls in 2012. 

The 34-year-old   returned to Goodison Park for Moyes' final Everton game in 2013 and continues to support the club.
