Britain should leave the European Union unless it changes, Theresa May has warned.

The Home Secretary said politicians who argue that the UK is better off in the EU 'whatever the terms, are wrong'.

Ranging beyond her law and order brief – in a move likely to fuel speculation about her leadership ambitions – Mrs May also warned red tape and regulations from Brussels is holding back the UK economy.

Home Secretary Theresa May has warned Britain cannot stay in the European Union at any cost

Mrs May faces a major test in the Commons tomorrow when she urges Tory MPs not to vote against plans to sign Britain up to the European Arrest Warrant.

She insisted that the way it operates now is 'fairer' but it is still 'every bit as effective when it comes to protecting the public from serious crime and terrorism'.

But writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the EU operates to work in the UK's interests.

She said: 'While access to the world's biggest single market is in our national interest, the EU's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy, but also the economies of every other member state. That is why we need to argue for changes that make the EU more competitive, more outward-looking and more open to global trade.

'These are the reasons I believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the EU, whatever the terms, are wrong. But I also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out, whatever the terms, are also wrong.

'Because if we can make Europe work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the European Union.'

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017

David Cameron's 'nods and winks' that he might back Britain leaving the European Union is putting the nation's future prosperity in danger, Ed Miliband claims.

The Labour leader will use a speech to the CBI tomorrow to warn the UK is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a 'conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'.

He will also pledge not to play 'political games' with Britain's EU membership and insist Labour has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms.

He will say: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU. There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence. Both are equally dangerous.

'Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit.

'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business.

'It is a betrayal of our national interest. It is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity.

'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.'

Mrs May also issued a direct plea for MPs to back the EAW. 'If we want to stop foreign criminals from coming to Britain, deal with European fighters coming back from Syria, stop British criminals evading justice abroad, prevent foreign criminals evading justice by hiding here, and get foreign criminals out of our prisons, these measures are vital.

'Tomorrow evening, the House of Commons should vote to give the police, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies the powers they need to keep us safe.'

Tory backbencher David Davis accused Mrs May of 'scaremongering' with her claims the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) would lead to Britain becoming a 'honeypot' for fugitives.

The Tory leadership face a revolt from dozens of Tory MPs,who could defy the party leadership to oppose the measure because of concerns that it is too easy for UK citizens to be extradited on relatively minor charges to countries where they may have no guarantee of a fair trial.

Writing in the Sunday Times Mr Davis said: 'It is better to take a few weeks longer to return a terrorist to British justice than to take three years longer to recover a British citizen from a foreign injustice.

'The warnings that Britain will become a safe haven for criminals is an example of the sort of scaremongering that has become far too prevalent in the debates on justice and anti-terrorism measures.

'The UK was certainly no safe haven prior to the introduction of the EAW.'

The controversial power is one of 35 European Union police and criminal justice measures the Government wants to opt back in to, with MPs expected to vote on the package as a whole.

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

Efforts to secure concessions from Brussels were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain last month.

On Friday Chancellor George Osborne boasted that he had halved the bill to £850million.

But critics accused him of 'smoke and mirrors', by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid.

Critics have claimed the reduction in the £1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway.
