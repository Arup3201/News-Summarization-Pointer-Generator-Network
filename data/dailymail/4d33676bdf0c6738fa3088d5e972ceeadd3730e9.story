Two Canadian joggers are lucky to be alive - and in one piece - after a scary run-in with a black bear on a trail in northeastern Alberta last week.

And just in case their friends don't believe them, they have video proof showing the curious bear following the two men and in some cases getting within just a few feet of the terrified joggers.

Bruce Allan and Greg Armour were jogging in on a wooded trail in Fort McMurray on June 5, when they bumped into a young black bear.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Up close and personal: Bruce Allan and Greg Armour bumped into this guy on a job in northern Canada earlier this month

Scary: The bear would frequently dart in and out of the woods and charge at the two men

Lucky: Bruce Allan videotaped much of the encounter as he and his friend tried to fend off a black bear

Terrified: Greg Armour says that at no point was he certain he and Allan were going to make it out alive  

The spot where the men crossed paths with the bear is just a couple of miles from where a a person was killed in a bear attack just last month.

The two men say they did what wilderness experts tell people to do when they are confronted by a bear -- but the animal refused to stop following them.

'The moment that I met the bear it was an instant "turn around, don’t 
make eye contact, walk away," and that didn’t seem to work,' Allan, who 
filmed the video, told CTV Edmonton.

In the video, the bear is seen following the two men four about four minutes before they finally make a break for it. Allan and Armour say that it actually started following them several minutes earlier.

'I was ready for him to pretty much pounce on me at any time,' Allan continues. 'For about three or four minutes I figured, what part of me is going to get gouged or ripped open?'

He's a climber: The bear would frequently climb up tress, climb down and then charge at the two men

Pursuit: The bear followed the two men for several minutes until they saw an opportunity to sprint to their Jeep and took it

The men yell at the bear and huddle close together to appear larger and hopefully scare the animal away. However, nothing seemed to work, and the bear continued to follow the men while occasionally climbing - and breaking - tree limbs and charging at them.

'He was showing all he could do right there, as far as I’m concerned,' said Armour.

The men grabbed large rocks in case they needed to defend themselves if the bear attacked - as if the rocks would do much.

Too close for comfort: The bear would get within a few feet of the two men

Safety: The two men started tried to joke about the frightening encounter after sprinting back to the safety of their Jeep

When Allan and Armour saw a chance to run, they took it, and made it over a bridge and into their Jeep unscathed - and with a wild story.

'There were definitely some moments where our escape was not guaranteed in any way,' Armour added.

The men have since brought bear spray, which they now take with them whenever they job in the woods. However, they both say it will be a long time before they head back to that particular trail.
