Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger returns to familiar surroundings on Tuesday night although it's a long, long time since he was in the Stade Louis II. 

Wenger managed Monaco between 1987 and 1994 - landing the Ligue 1 title in his first season and adding the French Cup a few years later - and his old club stand between the Gunners and a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

The team from the principality lead 3-1 after storming the Emirates three weeks ago and with the second leg set up to be a cracker, we've produced this picture special to mark the occasion and celebrate the early days of Wenger's career as a boss.

Monaco was Wenger's second club after a three-year spell at Nancy. He also managed Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan after Monaco and moved to Arsenal in 1996.

It would be fair to say Wenger had some hair-raising moments during his time at Monaco - if this picture from 1987 is anything to go by
