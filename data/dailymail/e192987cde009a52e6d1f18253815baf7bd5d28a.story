World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo is displaying without permission replicas of the FA Cup and Premier League trophies he won with Manchester United.

The Real Madrid forward’s CR7 Museum in his home town of Funchal houses all his individual trophies as well as copies of the silverware from team successes throughout his stellar career.

These include three replicas from his Premier League victories with United in 2007, 2008 and 2009, the FA Cup from 2004, the Champions League from 2008 and the FIFA Club World Cup, also from 2008.

An FA licence is required to copy the FA Cup and making replicas of the Premier League trophy needs PL approval. All are on display without the application process being started by the superstar’s representatives.

Neither English football body intends pursuing Ronaldo for breaching trophy regulations.

Roy Hodgson has told England’s stars of tomorrow to start dreaming of winning Euro 2020 at Wembley. UEFA announced that the stadium will play host to the final and both semi-finals of a tournament being staged across 13 cities.

England manager Hodgson said: ‘Young players have got to be thinking this is a great opportunity, not only to be part of a wonderful tournament but there at the end when the prizes are dished out.’

Yorkshire's strong support for captain Andrew Gale, who faces an ECB charge for using racist and abusive language against Lancashire batsman Ashwell Prince, is being interpreted as signalling the start of a battle between Giles Clarke and Yorkshire’s Colin Graves for the ECB chairmanship. 

It was Clarke who felt it inappropriate that Gale should receive the County Championship trophy when serving an ECB ban, with further charges pending, much to Yorkshire’s upset. Graves has the backing of many counties, making it a strong possibility he will lead domestic cricket while Clarke concentrates on the international game.

The FA look likely to be dragged into a messy legal fight following Edward Lord’s removal from their Inclusion Advisory Board for speaking out over the governing body’s lack of action on discrimination. Lord regards the FA statement about his sacking as defamatory and the eyebrows raised among the swimming fraternity over the chairman of the Amateur Swimming Association being dismissed by the FA in such a fashion makes it necessary for Lord to take measures to defend his reputation.

With discrimination issues now so prevalent across football, the picture gallery in UEFA headquarters in Nyon of the 17 white faces that comprise the executive committee of European football’s ruling body sends out all the wrong messages.

Sign of the times for Dyke

After the Watchgate hoo-ha of FA chairman Greg Dyke having to return his £16,400 Parmigiani watch given to him by the Brazilian federation, it wasn’t lost on the FA party arriving in Geneva for the Euro 2020 venue verdict that the one brand of Swiss watch being heavily advertised was… Parmigiani.

Dyke, who had intended to donate the gift to charity, was wearing a £70 Sekonda. But two other members of the FA group love expensive watches. General secretary Alex Horne had a Frank Muller on his wrist while England manager Roy Hodgson is an ambassador for Hublot, who brought out a special World Cup edition watch for him.

FIFA Congress delegates have been given £200 Longines watches, which also seem to fall outside items of ‘trivial or symbolic value’ allowed by FIFA’s ethics committee. UEFA chief Michel Platini says he doesn’t return gifts but will donate the value of his Parmigiani to charity.

There is understandable concern at BT Sport that their company logo remains prominent on convicted killer Oscar Pistorius’s profile picture on Twitter. BT are expected to approach the South African athlete’s representatives to have it changed before his sentencing next month. BT said: ‘Pistorius’s contract as a BT ambassador ended last year.’

The Footballer of the Year awards night in May is being moved from the London Lancaster hotel to The Landmark. This follows last year’s rumpus when organisers the Football Writers’ Association were moved from their traditional banqueting hall, where pictures of all previous winners adorned the walls, to a cramped suite below stairs because of a double booking with the British Sandwich Association.
