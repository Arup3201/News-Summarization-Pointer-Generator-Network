Cricket fans are used to seeing Jonny Bairstow on their television screens in the past week after the wicketkeeper helped Yorkshire to the County Championship.

But nobody was expecting the batsman-wicketkeeper to appear on a daytime television show. 

The 24-year-old appeared on ITV's Jeremy Kyle show on Monday, prompting other cricketers to give the Yorkshireman a ribbing.

James Taylor Tweeted: ‘Seen it all now @jbairstow21 on Jeremy Kyle show!!’ before Steven Finn replied: ‘Can’t believe what I’m seeing.’

He later Tweeted: ‘And the lie detector results are...’, referring to the show’s frequent use of the machine to discover whether guests are telling the truth.

Despite the England star refusing to confirm it was him on the show, it is understood that Bairstow met Kyle at the Grand National and the pair struck up a friendship, with the TV presenter then inviting the England cricketer to come down to his show.  

Bairstow hasn’t appeared for England since the last Ashes Test in January.
