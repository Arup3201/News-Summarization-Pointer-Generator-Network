Newsreader Michael Buerk has revealed that one of his biggest regrets in life is not pushing disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Saville off the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship when he had the chance.

The 68-year-old expressed his dislike for the former Radio 1 DJ, whose predatory and prolific sex abuse crimes came to light following his death, while discussing his life with his I'm a Celebrity campmates.

The journalist and former 999 host said he wished he had pushed the former children’s’ TV presenter into the sea when he had an opportunity.

The 68-year-old BBC veteran made the revelation while discussing his biggest regrets in life with campmates

The BBC journalist  said he wished he had pushed the former children’s’ TV presenter into the sea when he had an opportunity. He said he could have tipped Saville over the rail of the Queen Elizabeth 2 (file picture)

During Wednesday night’s episode of the ITV show, he told his fellow contestants: ‘My other regret is standing at the rail of the QE2 with Jimmy Saville who I personally disliked intensely before everyone else did, and my regret is not tipping him over the rail while I had the chance.'

It came after he revealed that his main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager.

He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his father, who was dying of cancer, and ‘feeling nothing’.

The father of two, who has been married to his wife Christine for more than 45 years, told the other contestants: ‘I’ve only one regret in my life and it was losing my mother before I was old enough to have a grown-up conversation with her.

‘My father was a bigamist and I didn’t really know very much about him, and if she had lived a few more years I would have learned a great deal more.’

His mother Betty, who had raised him by herself from the time he was three, died when he was 16, her heart having been weakened by scarlet fever in her childhood.

He added: ‘It was a complicated situation really. He was a Canadian army officer during the Second World War and he met my mother towards the end of the war and they obviously had a big thing and he married her and I was born, but he neglected to point out he was already married and had a wife back in Vancouver.

Buerk also revealed that his other main regret in life was not asking his mother about his bigamist father before she died when he was a teenager. He also spoke movingly about finally meeting his dying father

The newsreader told contestants: ‘My father was a bigamist and I didn’t really know very much about him'

It came amid fears he could become the third person to quit the jungle after complaining of severe hunger

‘He did divorce his first wife and then we lived in Vancouver until I was three and then, unsurprisingly given that kind of start, something happened, and this is the part I regret, I don’t know what happened and my first memory is coming back on a ship with my mother in 1949.’

The journalist revealed in his 2004 memoirs how his mother had been deceived by his father Gordon when the pair met at a Christmas dance in 1944.

The Canadian soldier had spent the war teaching map reading but convinced Betty that he was a war hero with both money and glory to his name.

He also told her his wife Helen had died – when in reality, Helen was alive and well in Canada.

The couple were married four months later. The truth came out only when Gordon returned to Vancouver to be demobbed from the army and Betty found a letter marked ‘From Mrs Gordon Charles Buerk’. Helen agreed not to press charges and instead to divorce him on grounds of infidelity. He then married Betty for a second time.

However, the marriage broke down in 1949 and three-year-old Michael and his mother returned to England.

Decades later, Buerk sought out his ‘old and sick’ father, finally confronting him in Canada in 1972.

He told his campmates: ‘I got married quite young and we went to Vancouver and I rang him up and he was terribly shocked and didn’t want to see me at all so I turned up on the doorstep and had two hours with him.

‘Bad decision I think. Because I felt nothing. It was all heavy stuff.’

The BBC veteran’s emotional admissions came amid growing concerns for his welfare.

Looking increasingly gaunt, the broadcaster has confessed he is finding the hunger and stresses of the jungle difficult to cope with, fuelling speculation he may become the third contestant to pull out of the I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! Jungle this year.

Looked tired and strained, he recently complained about the hunger and moaned: 'I would give my right arm, my left arm, maybe both legs [for food].

'I'm not quite sure how much further I would go but at this moment that is what I have in my mind.

'I'd dearly love a dish of pasta and a glass of white wine.'

Buerk's wife Christine, who he has been married to for more than 45 years, has flown out to Australia

There are concerns for BBC veteran as he continues to display a rather gaunt frame in the I'm a Celeb jungle

It came after TOWIE star Gemma Collins quit the jungle after just three days after complaining about feeling starved and worrying about contracting malaria.

Actor Craig Charles became the second person to leave the show and return to the UK, after being given the news that his brother Dean had suffered a fatal heart attack.

After being made aware that his older brother had passed away at the age of 52, the Red Dwarf actor returned to Croc Creek to tell his fellow celebrities that he was heading home to be with his family.
