David Cameron today revealed how the pictures of critically ill Ashya King alone in a Spanish hospital have brought back memories of his own son Ivan, who died at the age of just six.

The Prime Minister urged a 'rapid outbreak of common sense' to reunite five-year-old Ashya with his family, as his parents Brett and Naghmeh King were being held in a Madrid high security prison.

Spanish prosecutors said this afternoon they will argue the couple should be released and a judge is likely to agree to free them when they appear before a Madrid court tomorrow morning.

In a rare personal reflection, Mr Cameron said images of Ashya being treated in hospital had revived memories of Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. He died in 2009.

In an interview with LBC, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I obviously, like everyone else in the country, want to see this poor little boy re-united with his parents.

'Watching the pictures of him brought back memories of my desperately ill young boy, Ivan, and I remember him endlessly sitting on my lap and having to feed him through a tube and having to deal with all of the difficulties of having a desperately ill child.' 

Ashya's parents took him to Spain from Southampton General Hospital without consent last Thursday in the hope they could sell their holiday home on the Costa del Sol to raise money for specialist brain cancer treatment not available on the NHS.

Since Saturday night the five-year-old has been separated from his family and only his older brother Danny, 23, has been able to see him at Málaga's Hospital Materno-Infanti, where the brain cancer patient is being guarded by armed police. 

The Crown Prosecution Service told the High Court this afternoon they will withdraw their European Arrest Warrant, drop child cruelty charges and also abandon plans to force them to return to the UK. 

Mr Cameron said: 'I welcome the prosecution against Ashya King's parents being dropped. It's important this little boy gets treatment and the love of his family.'

More than 110,000 people have signed a petition demanding that Mr Cameron intervene to have the King's released. Supporters today went to Downing Street to hand in the petition at Number 10.

Mr Cameron insisted: 'The Government must not tell the police how to act or what to do, nor can we interfere in processes in other countries.

'I just hope there'll be an outbreak of common sense and a rapid outbreak of common sense so that the family can be re-united with this young boy and the best treatment can be given to him either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.'

He insisted the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is 'doing his bit to make sure we examine our own procedures here in the UK'.

It comes as a political chorus grew calling for the King family to be reunited. 

Nick Clegg said today it is 'not appropriate' to 'throw the full force of the law' at the case and Boris Johnson blasted the 'potty' decision because 'parents and a suffering child should be united'. 

Former children's minister Tim Loughton said the biggest outrage was that Ashya's case had almost become a child protection issue and his parents were being criminalised when that was 'clearly not the case'.

The Tory MP said an arrest warrant should not have been issued and that Mr and Mrs King should not be in custody.

He said: 'The CPS needs to drop this and make sure the parents come out and go and see their child.

'A very urgent conversation needs to be had with the NHS as to whether they will entertain grounds of them coming back here and going to a private clinic for proton beam treatment, which should be NHS or privately funded, or they should be allowed to take Ashya to Prague.'

Tory chairman Grant Shapps wrote on Twitter: 'Have to say that if my child was in hospital and I wanted them treated elsewhere, I would hope that the courts would not intervene.'
