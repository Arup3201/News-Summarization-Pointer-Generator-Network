These are the little puppies that brought a smile to Lady Thatcher's face just hours before she died.

The dogs belong to her close friend Lady Carla Powell and the video was shown to the former prime minister by Lord Charles Powell, one of her trusted advisers and one of the last people to see her alive.

Lady Thatcher would often visit Lady Carla's home in Italy spending days picking cherries in the sunshine and playing with the menagerie of animals that roam around the rambling farmhouse.

Fun: Lady Thatcher was said to have laughed at the video, which was shown to her by Lord Powell, whose feet are in the top of the picture

The short, minute long video was posted by Lady Carla on to her Facebook page, and shows the litter of Dachshund puppies playing on a white sheet on the floor of Lady Carla's home at Tivoli on the outskirts of Rome - her husband Lord Powell's feet can be seen as he sits on a sofa trying to control one of the playful brown dogs.

Along with the video Lady Carla wrote a poignant tribute to her friend of more than 30 years which read: 'This film of my puppies was shown to Lady Thatcher by my husband on Sunday night and brought her last smile.

'She died peacefully next morning. Charles was the last person to see her except her nurse. She used to come and spend some time with us in the Sabine Hills and she adored playing with my many animals, especially puppies and kittens.

'I shall miss her and can visualise her giving the All Mighty a hard time reorganising his set up in Heaven by privatising the cherubins.'

Baroness Thatcher's died on Monday inside her Ritz suite, where she spent the final months of her life.

Surrounded
by the people who cared for her, the Iron Lady died 'peacefully' here 
following a stroke at 11.28am on Monday, as she sat up and quietly read.

Lady
Thatcher, who had suffered a series of mini-strokes over the past 
decade, recognised the symptoms as she fell ill in the luxurious room, 
'but this was the one that killed her', a friend said.

The
suite, which would cost up to Â£3,660 a night, boasts 24 carat gold leaf
and antique Louis XVI furnishings, and is the size of a small flat.

Speaking from her home near Rome, Lady Carla added: 'Charles would often go and see her. He would spend time talking with her and the last time he saw he her showed the video of my darling puppies. One of them is called Maggie. The film made her smile Charles told me and then she drifted off to sleep.

'She would often be like that, going to sleep then waking up again, carrying on talking as is nothing had happened. Charles told me that he talked to her about the puppies and the other animals at my house here, our wonderful garden and the new pope.

'I'm not sure what she was able to take in but I think she found it comforting that she was with someone she knew and who was very close to her. I used to adore having her to stay here with me in Italy.

Room: Lady Thatcher had been staying in this suite at the Ritz in Central London, where she had been living since Christmas as she recovered from an operation, and this is where she watched the puppy video

'We would pick cherries together and I would drive her about on a little electric cart I have at the house as sometimes she couldn't manage the walk. We had fun talking with the animals and playing with them.

'Lady Thatcher adored animals and all of my mine are named after famous politicians - I've got a cross alsatian called Tony Blair and I even have a bossy goose called Margaret Thatcher who ended up killing one of the roosters.

'I once told Tony Blair when he came to stay that Margaret loved nuzzling his ears but of course I was talking about Margaret the goose and how he got on so well with Tony Blair the alsatian.'

Lady Carla, who is attending Lady Thatcher's funeral on Wednesday, said:'She was such a fighter and a determined woman. I can imagine her being bossy in Heaven, the country was fortunate to have her as a prime minister, we won't see anyone like her for a long time.'
