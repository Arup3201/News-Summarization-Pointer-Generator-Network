He could rival the likes of American basketball greats, such as the New Orleans Pelicans and the Atlanta Hawks.

Hidden talent: He can swim with the ball, take aim (left) and even do slam dunks - and rarely misses a shot (right). Bizarrely, the sport has become an unlikely cure for the 16-year-old otter's arthritic elbow joints

And bizarrely, the sport has become an unlikely cure for the 16-year-old otter's arthritis.

'There
 aren’t many natural opportunities for Eddie to work his arthritic 
elbow joints because sea otters don’t use their front limbs to swim - 
they swim by moving their back legs and flippers,' said Jenny DeGroot, lead sea otter keeper.

'We had to get creative. Training him with the basketball hoop was a way to get Eddie using his front limbs more regularly.'

Ms DeGroot said she was stunned by Eddie's aptitude for basketball after incorporating the sport into his daily exercise regime.

Score! Eddie has been looked after at the zoo since 2000 after being rescued off the coast of California

'He has definitely got game,' she said. 'Sea otters have incredible dexterity, so it makes sense that Eddie would have this hidden talent.'

The otter has been looked after at the zoo since 2000 after being rescued off the coast of California, where he was abandoned as a pup.

He has been trained in a number of other behaviours, such as allowing trainers to brush his teeth and place drops in his eyes.

Well-trained: He has been trained in a number of other behaviours, such as allowing trainers to brush his teeth

'We train the otters in a lot of behaviours geared toward their daily care, like allowing us to brush their teeth and check their gums,' said Ms DeGroot.

'Eddie presents his eyes for drops twice a day.

'Getting the animals to participate voluntarily greatly reduces their stress when we need to administer medical treatment.'
