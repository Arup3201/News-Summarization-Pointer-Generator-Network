A driver had his supercar confiscated by police because he could not bear to screw a numberplate into its bodywork.

Tsao He refused, saying the order by officers in Taiwan would spoil the bodywork of his £270,000 McLaren.

The MP4-12C, which does 0-60mph in just 3.1 seconds, was seized when police saw it parked in a street bay without its front plate.

A man in Taiwan refused to fit a front number plate to his McLaren MP4-12C (file picture) as he felt it would the spoil the supercar's bodywork

Mr He, 37, said: 'The car looks so perfect, I just couldn't bear to put holes in that beautiful body for something as ugly as a registration plate.

'I told them it was registered and I showed them the plate, which I keep under my seat. I couldn't believe it when they towed it away.'

Police in Taichung also gave him a £230 ticket for overstaying in the bay while they waited for a tow truck.

Mr He can apply for the car's return after he fits a plate but faces a fine to cover the cost of towing it away.

A police spokesman said: 'The car failed to display the proper documentation and has been confiscated.'

He added: 'When the owner is ready to obey the law and fit a registration plate he can apply for the return of his car but he will face a fine appropriate to the cost of towing the vehicle.'
