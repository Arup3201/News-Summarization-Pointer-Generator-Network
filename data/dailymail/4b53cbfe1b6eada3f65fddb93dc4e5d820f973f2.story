Pancake day originated as a way to use up spare ingredients in the pantry to avoid temptation during Lent.

But one Manchester restaurant has broken with tradition by including only the finest ingredients in their £800 pancake.

Layered with lobster, caviar and truffles, and topped with Dom Perignon Rose hollandaise sauce, Opus head chef Matthew Downes has created the most expensive pancake ever.

The most expensive pancake in the world will be available at Manchester restaurant Opus

The £800 creation uses Scottish Paradise Lobster, Russian Beluga Caviar, and Dom Perignon champagne

The previous world record holder was created at the same restaurant in 2009 and cost £144

Despite only being at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel - where the restaurant is based - for three years, Chef Matthew has smashed the previous pancake record of £144 set in 2009 by his predecessor.

He said: 'We thought of doing a posh pancake because we knew Pancake Day was coming up and we thought we could make something a bit special out of it.

'We used only the finest ingredients to give it that extra-wow factor. I’m really proud of what we’ve created, the taste certainly lives up to the price tag.

'All we wanted to do was make the finest pancake you could ever taste and it’s turned into the world’s most expensive.'

Head chef Matthew Downes, who created the pricy pancake, has been at the eatery for three years

Despite using some of the world's most expensive ingredients, Chef Matthew also uses traditional butter, sugar and milk in order to make the pancake

The dish, which takes 20 minutes to make, is not available on the regular menu but diners can request it

Chef Matthew only takes 20 minutes to create the ‘posh’ pancake and loves experimenting with expensive ingredients.

He said: 'In all my years as a chef I’ve never made a pancake so expensive.

'As you know none of these ingredients are cheap and it makes you a very proud chef to be able to work them.

'Although it can be a little nerve wracking in the kitchen as you certainly don’t want to get an order like this wrong.

'The pancake isn’t on the menu but we can take orders especially for people who would love to try it.'

The main ingredients for the seafood-inspired dish is Scottish Native Paradise Lobster, Russian Beluga Caviar, as well as Hulle Verge Truffle, Scottish Mussels and Langoustine prawns.

Shrove Tuesday, more popularly known as pancake day, was traditionally used to eat up spare ingredients in the pantry before to avoid temptation during Lent

Beluga caviar is the eggs of the beluga sturgeon, native to the Caspian Sea, and usually sells for around £120 for an ounce

The Paradise Lobster and Beluga pancakes with Dom Pirignon Rose hollandaise also uses the more traditional ingredients of eggs, flour, milk and salt.

The previous record-holding pancake was made with Madagascan vanilla pods costing £3 each and 23-carat edible gold leaf at £8 a sheet.

It was served with organic strawberries plus jelly made from Dom Perignon champagne at £115 a bottle.

Shrove Tuesday, otherwise known as pancake day, marks the last day before Lent - a 40 day period of abstinence.

The largest pancake was created in Rochdale, Manchester, UK in 1994, by the Co-Operative Union, Ltd. Measuring 15.01 m (49 ft 3 in) in diameter and 2.5 cm (1 in) thick, the pancake weighed 3 tonnes (6,614 lb).

Australian celebrity chef Brad Jolly, who holds the record for most tosses of a pancake in one minute, notching up 140 flips in 60 seconds during an event in Sydney in 2012.

Dominic Cuzzacrea made a monumental flip measuring 9.47 m (31 ft 1 in) at the Walden Galleria Mall in Cheektowaga, New York, in November 2010 to create the highest ever pancake toss.

The most people tossing pancakes is 890 and was achieved at an event in Sheffield, South Yorks in February 2012.

While flipping a pancake continuously in a frying pan, American athlete Mike Cuzzacrea completed a 26 mile a marathon in a time of 3 hr 2 min 27 sec on 24 October 1999.
