Cavani has been the subject of much speculation - with Manchester Untied rumored to be among the clubs interested in him - but last week said he was happy at the French side.

'I feel good at Paris and I count on staying, but considering how this window has gone so far, nobody really knows,' he told Ovacion.

'The idea was for me to stay in Paris and the owner of the club thinks the same.'
