As Kim Jong Un threatens to attack the US, the North Koreans may be about to pull their ambassador out of London.

A sign outside the pariah state's embassy - an ordinary home in west London - says they will be 'loading' on Tuesday morning.

Despite North Korea warning that the safety of foreigners in their country 'cannot be guaranteed' beyond next Wednesday, the Foreign Office are refusing to pull their man out of Pyongyang.

Getting out? A sign outside the North Korean embassy suggests the ambassador could be quitting London - as there will be 'loading' on Tuesday morning

Quitting London? The seven-bedroom ordinary home that is the North Korean embassy where ambassador Hyon Hak Bong lives

Although Britain are staying put, a sign pinned to a tree outside the oppressive regime's base in Ealing suggests ambassador Hyon Hak Bong may be about to retreat.

It said: 'Advance notice. Please do not park here during the following period when loading work will take place. Thanks for your cooperation.'

Tonight a man who answered the phone at the embassy in Gunnersbury Avenue claimed they had no plans to quit Britain.

When asked why the sign was there, he responded: 'One guy, a secretary is leaving the country at the end of his term. He asked for a van to carry all of his belongings.

'There is a new secretary coming soon.'

He refused to give the name of the old secretary or say who the replacement will be.

Pressed on whether they were leaving, the official said 'no' and added 'The embassy is open every day. Call back tomorrow. There is no one here now.'

When the MailOnline asked the man on the phone to identify himself he hung up.

While other ambassadors get to live in some of Britain's most expensive properties near Hyde Park, North Korean Mr Bong has to put up with a modest 1920s home.

The seven-bedroom property, down the road from where Carry On star Sid James lived, has been home to the pariah state since 2003.

Demonstrators regularly gather outside the ordinary property which stands out only because of the 40ft flagpole in the garden.

It was business as usual at the property on Friday when Mr Bong's wife was seen going out shopping.

Although they keep the blinds drawn down, neighbours said they were nice people.

One said: ‘We had some of the diplomats round for a drink 
once,’ he said. ‘They told us they love England.

‘But I suppose that’s no surprise coming from North Korea, is it? One of them said he was a big fan of The X Factor.’

Amid mounting tensions, Foreign Secretary William Hague today insisted Britain 'should be concerned' about North Korea's activities.

He said the 'danger of miscalculation' by Kim Jong-un's regime, which had worked itself up into a 'frenetic state of rhetoric', must be considered.

But he insisted it was vital the international community remained calm and stressed there were no signs that North Korea was beginning to re-position its forces ready for war.

Speaking on BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hague said: 'There's a threat to the world from any country breaching the non-proliferation treaty, which North Korea is doing, acting in contravention of a whole series of UN Security Council resolutions and setting out to develop more and more longer range weapons, testing new nuclear weapons and indulging in the proliferation of many items to other countries as well.

'We should be concerned about that. There is a danger in that.

'But it is important to stress that we haven't seen in recent days, in recent weeks, a change in what is happening in North Korean society. We have not been able to observe that. We've haven't seen the repositioning of forces or the redeployment of ground forces that one might see in a period prior to a military assault or to an all out conflict.'Mr Hague declined to speculate on whether the 29-year-old dictator was 'nuts'.
