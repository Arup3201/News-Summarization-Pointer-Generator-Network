The number of NHS patients forced to share hospital accommodation with the opposite sex rose slightly last month.

Data from the Department of Health reveals 1,244 breaches of mixed sex rules in England in October, up from a record low of 1,079 in September.

The number of breaches had been falling after the Government introduced fines to tackle the problem.

Stress and indignity: Life on a mixed sex ward in an NHS hospital. Hospitals are fined £250 a day if they do not stick to the rules

Hospitals are docked £250 per patient per day if they place people with members of the opposite sex without clinical justification.

Of the 167 acute trusts that submitted data for October, 114 made no breaches of the rules.

Hospitals in two strategic health authorities – London and South East Coast – accounted for almost two thirds of breaches across the country. One trust – East Sussex – accounted for 169 breaches due to a short-term problem.

A statement from the trust said there were a few days in October when there was a ‘sudden surge in severely ill patients’ needing admission to the hospital. ‘This led to one of our day units being used to admit inpatients requiring an operation,’ it said.

‘The trust is committed to minimising cancelled operations and, for this short period of time, exceptional measures were introduced to ensure patients requiring an operation could be admitted.

‘Whilst from a quality perspective, patients were cared for well, some patients had to change behind closed curtains into theatre gowns in order to go to theatre.

‘This breached Department of  Health guidelines of same-sex accommodation.’

Single-sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping, bathroom and toilet facilities, either in single rooms or single-sex wards

Single-sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping, bathroom and toilet facilities, either in single rooms or single-sex wards.

If men and women share a ward, then they must have separate bays or rooms. Intensive care and A&E are exempt from the policy.

Almost 12,000 hospital patients stayed in mixed-sex accommodation last December, when monthly collection of data was first introduced.

Since then the number of reported breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has fallen by 90 per cent.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said ‘Treating patients in mixed-sex accommodation compromises their dignity and causes additional stress at what is already a difficult and anxious time. For years, governments have said that clamping down on this is a priority, yet still it continues to happen.

‘Now the Department of Health’s figures show a marked increase in the number of people staying in mixed-sex accommodation.

‘It is clear that cuts are beginning to bite and hospitals are struggling to ensure that the care they provide is up to an acceptable standard.

‘It is not enough to spout rhetoric about mixed-sex accommodation being unacceptable, the Department of Health needs to provide practical support to the trusts who continue to breach mixed-sex accommodation guidelines to stamp out this problem once and for all.’

Health Minister Simon Burns said ‘The NHS has made significant improvement in tackling mixed-sex accommodation – down almost 90 per cent in under a year, thanks to improved transparency.

‘But despite this overall improvement, nobody should have to suffer the indignity of mixed-sex accommodation.

‘Every unjustified breach is one too many.’
