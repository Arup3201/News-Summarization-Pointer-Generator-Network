Three police officers have been questioned as part of an investigation into the suspicious death of 13-month-old Poppi Iris Worthington

Three police officers have been questioned over alleged misconduct relating to the suspicious death of a 13-month-old baby whose case has been shrouded in official secrecy.

Little Poppi Iris Worthington, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, died in December 2012. But a draconian order imposed by judges has prevented any details of her death being revealed, despite a long-running police probe.   

During an inquest in October last year that lasted a mere seven minutes, a coroner simply ruled that the cause of Poppi's death was 'unascertained' and failed to disclose any other information. 

But it has now emerged that three officers from Cumbria Police have been questioned under caution over misconduct allegations.

It can also be revealed that one officer, who was suspended after concerns that the force did not respond ‘properly and appropriately’ to the girl's death, has since retired from the force.

The news comes after the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said it would be investigating whether opportunities to obtain 'key evidence' were 'identified and appropriately acted upon'.

The IPCC said it received a referral from Cumbria Police on June 27 last year and began its independent investigation on July 2.

The body has since spoken to 13 witnesses and three police officers, who have been interviewed under caution.

But the watchdog refused to disclose a copy of the Cumbria Police referral, which gives details of the exact allegations under investigation.

A spokesman said the public interest in openness and transparency is 'outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations'. 

After Poppi's death, a far-reaching injunction prevented the media from revealing various details about the case, including the hospital in which she died.

The opening of the inquest in also took place in private. According to coroners' rules, inquests should always be held in public unless exceptional matters of national security are involved.

But following a challenge by media groups, the senior coroner for Cumbria, David Roberts, wrote to the Attorney General to ask for a new hearing.

Lawyers representing several newspaper groups - Associated Newspapers Limited, which publishes MailOnline, Times Newspapers Ltd and Guardian News & Media- had written to Mr Roberts to argue the inquest was insufficient and therefore unlawful.

In a written reply to law firm RPC, Mr Roberts, said: 'My own view is that it would be desirable for a fresh inquest to take place, not least so that conclusions as to how, when and where Poppi Worthington came by her death can be recorded.

'Neither I nor Mr Smith has power to hold a further inquest without the permission of the High Court. However, it is open to me to seek a fiat (order) from the Attorney General to pursue an application under section 13 of the Coroners Act for an Order that a fresh inquest is to be held and I will now be doing so.' 

The police investigation had led to the arrest of two people, including Poppi's father Paul Worthington, 46.

Last week it emerged the 46-year-old and a 30-year-old woman arrested will not face further action.  

The IPCC probe is being overseen by senior investigator Catherine Hall and commissioner Carl Gumsley. 

In a statement, an IPCC spokesman said: 'We are independently investigating the force's response to Poppi's death - whether its investigation was conducted thoroughly and appropriately and whether investigative opportunities to obtain key evidence in the investigation were identified and appropriately acted upon.'  

FOI officer Philip Johnston said: 'Enquiries by the police and the IPCC into the concerns arising from the circumstances of Poppi Worthington's death, including criminal matters relating to members of the public and issues of police conduct relating to Cumbria Constabulary, are currently ongoing.'

He added: 'I have concluded the public interest in openness and transparency is at this stage outweighed by the significant public interest in protecting the integrity of investigations and the inquest and in maintaining confidence in the IPCC's law enforcement functions more generally.'
