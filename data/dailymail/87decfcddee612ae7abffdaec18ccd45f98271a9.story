From their love of Hunter wellies to their penchant for Barbour jackets, the Royal family are known for their quintessentially British style.

And since Kate has married into the country's favourite family, she has become quite the trendsetter, giving their style credentials a big boost.

So what better way to celebrate how fashionable they are than hosting a catwalk at Buckingham Palace to showcase the monarchy's latest must-haves?

Next July, as part of the four-day Coronation Festival which will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, a catwalk show will be staged at Buckingham Palace.

The public can take their seats as the products of royal warrant holders - companies and businesses that have supplied goods or services to Her Majesty, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales for five years or more - will display their goods.

Brands on show will include Savile Row 
tailors Gieves & Hawkes and Dege & Skinner, alongside the 
Queen's firm favourite footwear Hunter wellingtons, Milborrow chimney 
sweeps and the bespoke Tom Smith Christmas crackers bought by the Queen 
for celebrations at Sandringham, according to The Evening Standard.

Speaking about the catwalk, a spokesman for Hunter wellies said: 'Obviously we hold two Royal warrants which we are very proud of so it is an honour for us to be involved.'

The event will take place between July 11 and July 14 2013 and will offer a candid insight into the products the Royal family use and love.

Tickets, which start at Â£30, will go on sale on Sunday at coronationfestival.com.
