A man who survived cancer three times has revealed how he beat the deadly disease by overhauling his diet and swapping beers and partying for vegetable juices and meditation.

Scott Stephens, 37, from Warneet, an hour out of Melbourne, was like any other normal guy  when he encountered his 'worst nightmare' at just 23.

After finding a suspicious looking mole on his thigh Mr Stephens went to a skin specialist to have it looked at. 

Scott Stephens was just 23 when he was diagnosed with melanoma on his thigh 

Mr Stephens was given the all clear after the first diagnosis but was but six months later he was told the melanoma had returned to the lymph nodes in his groin

He says even the doctor didn't suspect anything serious when he removed the mole and sent the samples off as a precaution.

'The skin specialist called me to give me the news. He said it was Metastatic Melanoma and I just couldn't believe it', the father of two told Daily Mail Australia.

'At such a young age I didn't believe I could have cancer. 

'I had some scans and the doctors removed the tissue around the mole and I was given the all clear, I thought that was a close call.' 

Just six months later Mr Stephens went for a check up and was given the devastating news that the melanoma had returned to the lymph nodes in his groin. 

Mr Stephens had 12 months of chemotherapy and went into remission, he got married and starting trying to live a 'normal life' before the cancer returned again for a third time 

He was put on a 12-month course of immunotherapy treatment which took him into remission and he started to live his life again.

He said: 'At the end the doctors said 'you are all good' and they said I was in remission. 

'It was a tough time because you still live in fear and at the early stages you are pretty fragile individual, any aches I had I thought its back, it must be the cancer. 

'I never sunbathed as a kid and my parents always put sun cream on me. 

'I never considered myself to be a lobster, I was 23 when all this started, back then I thought I was an adult, now when I look back, I was like a baby.'

After nine months of being in remission Mr Stephens proposed to his girlfriend and she said yes and he says he tried to return to a 'normal life'. 

They got married on a beach and started building a house for their new life together. 

But just after returning from their honeymoon his regular check ups revealed a large mass in his chest. 

The melanoma returned to his chest, pelvis and bowels and he says he hit 'rock bottom' and it was then he decided to get healthier and change his diet

He said: 'The doctors considered me to be a risk so I was on six monthly check ups. A biopsy on the tumour confirmed the melanoma was back. 

'I had major surgery to remove the tumour and I came out clean. It was then at my next three monthly check up that the doctors told me the tumour was back and it had spread to my pelvis and the bowel. 

'After the massive surgery I was not prepared for that and I just cried. 

'I asked the doctor what can we do and he said I could have chemotherapy but it only had a five per cent success rate. 

'I thought I am only 27, I hit rock bottom, I thought I am going to die. I hit the the wall and thought my number was up, this could be it.

'After I had the chest surgery and in between the diagnosis, I was bed ridden and a friend told me about The Gawler Foundation that provide support and information for people with cancer. 

'I thought I am going to do this and I attended one of their groups.' 

Mr Stephens went on a retreat and he says they talked about all the things you can do to help yourself like meditation, nutrition, vegetable juicing and make yourself the healthiest person you can be.

He said: 'I decided then to change my life, it was a massive cultural shift for me. I was a beer drinking carnivore and I had a terrible diet.

The father of two got a juicer and began meditating everyday and practising Qi Gong to help him overcome the cancer 

'This new thing I was thinking about was a massive shift, I wanted to live, so I took all the meat and beer out of my fridge, I started to do light exercise, I used to walk around the block, that was all I could handle. 

'I adopted a proper plant based diet and just thought I am just going to look after myself to the best of my ability and I thought I am just going to give this my best shot and hopefully I will live. 

'I started a new round of chemotherapy about the same time and I lost 10kg in a week. 

'I didn't think I could take much more, I thought chemotherapy was going to finish me off so I decided to not keep going with it. 

'I made my peace with the world, it was up and down, but at the next appointment three months later I went back to my doctor and he said I was stable and that was the best news we could hope for.' 

Mr Stephens was practising Qi Gong, meditating three times a day for 45 minutes, juicing four times a day and walking half an hour each day. 

Months later doctors found the tumour had disappeared and Mr Stephens has now been cancer free for eight years 

He said: 'I was really looking after myself and three months after having surgery for a blocked bowel I had another check up. 

'My doctor was going through my notes reading the report and when he got to the end there was no mention of the tumour. 

'We thought he had the wrong notes but he pulled up the scan and it showed the tumour on the pelvis had gone.' 

Mr Stephens has now been cancer free for eight years and is a proud father to seven-year-old Lily and five-year-old Flynn. 

Mr Stephens has continued to meditate daily and doesn't eat meat since beating cancer 

Mr Stephens says the 'changes saved my life' and he 'would not be alive today' without them 

'That just gave me more motivation to live a healthy life. I know these changes saved my life and without the tools I have had along the way I know that I would not be alive today.' 

Mr Stephens will be taking part in the Cancer Council Victoria Seven Parks Walk on Sunday, October 5. 

He is an ambassador for the Cancer Council and wants to raise awareness of the disease.  

It is a 27km loop around the inner city of Melbourne, highlighting the magnificent parks of the city.

Parks along the route include Albert Park, Docklands Park, Flagstaff Gardens, Royal Park, Princes Park, Treasury Gardens and Melbourne & Olympic Parks. 

At each of the seven parks will be an event village, with select villages providing food, refreshments and entertainment.
