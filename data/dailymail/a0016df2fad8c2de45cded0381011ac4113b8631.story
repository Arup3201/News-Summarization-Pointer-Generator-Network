When Claire Weller found she was pregnant, just a few months after suffering a miscarriage, she felt joy and anxiety in equal measure.

While delighted to be expecting again, she was also worried her unborn baby might suffer the same sad fate as the one she had lost 16 weeks into her previous pregnancy.

So, when a friend offered to lend her a foetal Doppler - a handheld ultrasound listening device used by midwives at antenatal appointments - to check her unborn baby's heartbeat, she leapt at the opportunity, never imagining the panic it would induce.

'I thought being able to hear my baby's heart beating would be hugely reassuring,' says Claire, 32, of Chessington, Surrey. 'But I didn't bargain for the terror I'd feel when I was unable to detect a heartbeat.

'This happened several times. Once, seven months into my pregnancy, I got into such a state that my partner, James, had to race me to Kingston Hospital for an emergency scan.

'Everything was fine, but it took a few hours for me to calm down - not ideal when stress in pregnancy poses such a risk to you and your baby.'

Indeed, as foetal Dopplers become a must-have piece of kit for mums-to-be, the Royal College of Midwives has issued a warning about the risks they pose. They urge pregnant women to seek medical advice if they are worried about their baby, rather than attempting to self-diagnose with a Doppler.

'We advise against personal Dopplers as it takes considerable training to use them properly,' says Jane Munro of the RCM. 'It can cause needless stress to a pregnant woman when she cannot pick up her baby's heartbeat. It can lead to raised blood pressure in the mother and premature births.

12 weeks: Claire Weller used a personal Doppler to listen to her unborn children's heartbeats

'More worrying, we've had cases where there has been something wrong with a baby and the mother has been wrongly reassured after hearing her own heartbeat, or the sound of blood pumping through the placenta, leading to a dangerous delay in her seeking medical attention. In at least one instance, sadly the baby died.'

So the message from midwives is loud and clear: leave the job to the professionals.

Although Dopplers for home use can be picked up for as little as £30 from online retailers including Amazon, the £250 model Claire borrowed from her friend was identical to ones used in hospitals. In fact, it was so sensitive that, at ten weeks pregnant, Claire detected two foetal heartbeats and realised she was expecting twins.

'At my first antenatal appointment I said to the midwife: "I think it's twins,"' recalls Claire, whose partner, James, 38, is a chauffeur. 'She couldn't believe how early I'd picked up the heartbeats.'

Claire then used the Doppler every other day, and fought the urge to listen in more often.

'It sometimes took me 40 minutes to find a heartbeat and even longer to pick up two, because you don't know whether you're hearing the same heartbeat twice. I'd get anxious checking and double checking,' she says. 'Later in the pregnancy one of my twins was breech and the other head down, so it was a real struggle locating both of their little hearts.

'I got into a terrible state seven months into the pregnancy because my breech baby was not moving very much and I couldn't pick up a clear heartbeat. Realising how worried I was, James took me to hospital.

'Thankfully the obstetrician who scanned me was able to reassure me that both our babies were fine.'

The twins, Bobby and Jack, were born in March last year, each weighing a robust 7lb.

Although there are no official figures on the number of mums using Dopplers, midwives have reported a huge increase in pregnant women who admit to listening to their babies' heartbeats at home.

Dr Thomas Aust, an obstetrician at the Wirral's Arrowe Park Hospital, first raised the alarm in the summer of 2009 after a 27-year-old woman was admitted to his antenatal ward due to reduced foetal movement 32 weeks into her first pregnancy.

The unnamed woman told doctors that she had first noticed her baby had become less active two days previously, but had been reassured that all was well after using her own Doppler to listen to its heartbeat.

However, concerned by a lack of movement during monitoring, doctors performed an emergency Caesarean later that evening. The baby was so unwell it spent its first eight weeks on the special care unit.

While recognising the inevitable anxiety women experience during pregnancy, Jane Munro, of the RCM, questions the ethics of companies which sell and loan personal Dopplers.

'I think it's unethical for retailers to overstate their usefulness,' says Jane. 'It's far more important for mothers-to-be to tune into any changes they notice in their baby’s movements than to encourage them to rely on a gadget.'

That's a lesson that Julie Hainsworth, an NHS receptionist from Leeds, learnt the hard way.

While pregnant with her fourth child, Toby, now six months old, she bought a Prenatal Foetal Doppler for £30 on eBay.

'I bought it so that our older children could hear the heartbeat and feel more involved,' recalls Julie, 32. 'But it was such a worrying pregnancy because I discovered early on that his heart rate was quite irregular.

'I'd creep off and listen while my husband, Christopher, was supervising the children's teatime. When I told my midwife about my concerns, she advised me to stop using the Doppler because it was likely to be more stress-inducing than reassuring.

'I couldn't resist the temptation to listen in. However, I couldn't make sense of what I was hearing.'

As the pregnancy progressed, Julie was unable to hide her fears from Christopher, 31, a landscape gardener. From the 26th week of pregnancy, Julie was admitted to St James's Hospital in Leeds no less than 12 times for monitoring after she raised concerns about her baby's heart rate.

Toby was born at 37 weeks, three weeks before his due date, weighing just 4lb 6oz, but otherwise healthy. 'After all those months of worry, of not knowing whether his irregular heart rate symbolised some underlying problem, it was such a relief to finally hold Toby,' says Julie.

When a year later, she became pregnant with her youngest child, Arya, now five months old, she was far more cautious about using her Doppler.

'I picked up her heartbeat nine weeks into the pregnancy,' recalls Julie. 'But then I only used the Doppler a handful of times. Yes, it was hugely tempting, but I couldn't put myself through all that worry again for another nine months.'

Kayley Boden is another mother who succumbed to home monitoring, much to her midwife's disapproval. She bought a Doppler for £40, but struggled to detect her baby's heartbeat.

'I finally heard something at 24 weeks, but even then it was hard to detect,' says Kayley, 21, a trainee teacher. 'I thought the Doppler was going to reassure me but in fact it did the opposite.

'I rang my midwife in a state when I couldn't hear anything. She said they don't recommend personal Dopplers.

'She said it didn't help for me to be worried because the baby would become stressed and the heartbeat would be even harder to find. After that, I didn't dare call her again when I couldn't detect a heartbeat so I'd just keep trying and fretting.'

Eight months into her pregnancy, Kayley's baby became worryingly still, but she decided not to seek immediate help when her mind was put at rest after checking for the heartbeat herself.

'Because I'd heard the heartbeat, I decided to hold on until the following day when I had an antenatal appointment,' says Kayley. 'But towards evening time, she still wasn't moving so I called my midwife who told me to go straight into the assessment unit.'

Kayley's daughter, Erica, was born five days past her due date at Warrington Hospital, weighing 8 lb 2.5 oz.

'She's healthy so there was no need for all that angst,' says Kayley. 'If I have another baby, I won't use the Doppler again - it's not worth all the stress it causes.'

How ironic, then, that this is a device marketed with the promise of alleviating anxiety in pregnancy.
