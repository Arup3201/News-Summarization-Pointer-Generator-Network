A seven-year-old boy watched a bus crash into his home and kill his younger brother as the pair were getting ready for bed.

David Granados ,6, died after being pinned against a wall when the bus plowed into the front room of their Long Island home after swerving to avoid a pedestrian.

'The bus kind of fell on my brother . . . he fell down and got squished,' said his older brother Josue Molina who was released from hospital on Wednesday with a few scratches.

'I saw the bus coming toward my house. My brother was kind of walking by in his pajamas.'

Horrific: The boy was crushed to death against a wall when the NICE bus ploughed through the front room

'Tore down front of the house': Police said a number of the 15 passengers on board the bus were injured

Both boys were rushed to 
Winthrop-University Hospital, where David was pronounced dead about an 
hour after the 9:30 p.m. tragedy at their Hempstead home which was 
shared by two families. 

His boy's mother Maribel Molina was making school lunches in the kitchen when the accident happened and said the explosion was 'Like a bomb!'

The boy's stepfather Santos Herrera, used a used a neighbor’s hammer to smash through a window in a bid to rescue the siblings.

'I did my best' said Mr Herrera. 'I saved the older one. The other one, I didn’t see. He was pinned.'

Alida Gutierrez, a family friend who was inside the home, said: 'It came out of nowhere. It was loud and horrifying and tore down the front of the house.

'The
boys' mom and I were in the kitchen, preparing the kids' lunch just 
like we always do. We were just talking. Then… I can't describe it.'

Edgar Laso, 35, who also lives in the
house which has 12 residents,  said the boy's brother, seven year-old 
Josue, was in bed at the time.

'Some of the glass cut Josue's legs and body. There was blood everywhere,' he told the New York Daily News.

Clear-up operation: The conditions of those hurt were not immediately known, but police say the pedestrian suffered non-life threatening injuries

He said the family moved from El Salvador nine years ago.

The crash happened near the intersection of Fulton Street and Nassau Place.

Hempstead police the N70 Nassau 
Inter-County Express (NICE) bus had swerved to avoid the pedestrian, hit them and
lost control.

The unidentified 35-year-old pedestrian suffered multiple fractured ribs, a broken clavicle and a fractured skull.

Is it believed he was jaywalking at the time and could now face criminal charges.

Eight of the 11 bus passengers had minor injuries.

Cops do not believe criminality played a factor in the crash.

Inspector Kenneth Lack, a Nassau County Police Department 
spokesman, said that it appeared the pedestrian did not heed several attempts 
by the bus driver to alert him, including honking his horn before the 
accident.

A spokesperson for NICE said the company 'is cooperating with police officials and has its own team investigating the incident'.

The bus driver, who is a ten year veteran, will not face charges.
