Cristiano Ronaldo has hit back at suggestions he questioned Real Madrid's transfer dealings following the departures of Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria from the Bernabeu, claiming he was misinterpreted.

When asked about what he thought of the departures of Alonso and Di Maria at the Jarama racing circuit in Madrid on Monday, the 29-year-old reportedly said 'If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,' but Ronaldo has refuted such claims via his official Twitter account.

He said on Saturday: 'My statements were misinterpreted . Yesterday I heard what my president had to say and I'm with him 100%.'

Support: Ronaldo has backed his club's transfer dealings despite reported claims he made earlier in the week

Claims: Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly said he would have done things differently if he was in charge at Madrid

The Portuguese international was missing through injury as Madrid fell to a 4-2 defeat against Real Sociedad last Sunday and reportedly vented his frustration at the club's transfer policy in the aftermath of the defeat.

It came as a surprise to many that Madrid let both Alonso and Di Maria leave the club this summer, although they did strengthen their ranks significantly elsewhere, with the £60million signing of James Rodriguez a stand-out signing from across the world.

But the superstar was quick to quash such suggestions that he was frustrated at the club adding: 'The new partners are top people and with them we have completed a large squad. Let us all hug and Hala Madrid!'

Madrid president Florentino Perez has also had his say on the issue insisting he has 'no doubt that he (Ronaldo) did not want to question the club's policies.' 

Madrid sit mid-table in La Liga after a win and defeat from their opening two games, with Ronaldo expected to return in time for his side's clash against title rivals Atlético Madrid next Saturday.
