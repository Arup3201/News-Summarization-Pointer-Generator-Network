Tom Ince’s England future is in serious doubt after he and dad Paul took the decision to snub a place at the Under-21 European Championships this summer.

Boss Gareth Southgate has warned his former England team-mate of the consequences of his son turning his back on the Three Lions.

Ince Snr – England’s first black captain – has told Southgate they want to concentrate on Tom’s club career rather than represent his country in Czech Republic.

That is certain to leave a bitter taste among those at the Football Association, including senior manager Roy Hodgson.

Southgate said: ‘I have told Tom and Paul they need to be aware of the possible consequences of this decision in terms of how it would appear from the outside. I think they understand that.

‘I have had discussions with Tom and his dad over the last week or so and the message from both was exactly the same. I have to say I was surprised. ‘It was not something we’d been conscious of previously and it is for Tom to explain his full reasons.

‘But he feels at this moment in time he has got some priorities at club level. There is some uncertainty about where he is going to be next season.’ Southgate – speaking at Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium where he announced his squad for forthcoming friendlies with Czech Republic and Germany - added: ‘He will not be involved in the summer now. That’s because he has been through qualifying and I assumed he would have wanted to put himself on this big stage.

‘I think in life you should be as open as you can to opportunities and stay in positions that lead to opportunities. Tom has decided this is an opportunity he doesn't want to take.’ Ince is currently on loan at Derby County after falling out of favour at Hull City, the club he only joined last summer amid interest from Inter Milan.

However, it now appears he will again be on the move in the close-season.

It was only this season that the 23-year-old told Sportsmail about his pride at representing England.

Indeed, his dad’s blood-stained England shirt from the famous goalless draw in Italy which secured qualification for France ’98 is framed at home.

And Ince had hoped for promotion to Hodgson’s full squad after his appearance at the Euros.

‘I’ve had two great years at Under-21 level and my ambition now is to try to push for the senior team,’ he said in September.

‘Playing for a club in the Premier League and the exposure that comes with that will hopefully provide me with the pathway to do it. ‘You can see at the minute Roy Hodgson is giving a lot of young players from the Under-21s and Premier League clubs a chance. I hope I can get that opportunity – although it doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate playing for the Under-21s at major tournaments.’
