Former tennis champion and Australian of the Year Pat Rafter and his wife Lara have sold their three-bedroom terrace in Sydney's exclusive suburb, Woollahra for $2.4 million.

Initially the Rafters had hoped for $2.8 million when listing the property for auction in June, but five months later the contemporary 280-square-metre property sold for $200,000 under the asking price.

The eastern suburb property sold in a private treaty through McGrath agency, after the Woollahra terrace failed to sell at auction in May and was withdrawn from its June auction.

According to RP Data, the Rafters bought the Wallis Street property in 2007 for a cost of $2.35 million, the same year they sold their Mosman property for $7.75 million.

Despite their difficulty in selling the double-storey house, the sandstone home is located just one and half kilometres from the Moore Park tennis court and walking distance to Oxford Street's cafes and up-market shops.

The block has rear access and off street parking for a small car, according to McGrath. 

It's private entertainment deck, stunning landscaped gardens and spacious living room is the perfect home for entertaining.
