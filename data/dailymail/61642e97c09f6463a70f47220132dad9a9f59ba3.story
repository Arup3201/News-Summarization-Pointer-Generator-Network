A former Marine changed his plea to guilty today on the first day of his murder trial after admitting to strangling his wife and dumping her body in a river.

Caleb Crew, 26, appeared in court on Monday morning for the first day of his trial in Fairfax County, Virginia and told the judge that he wanted to change his plea to guilty for first-degree murder.

Crew, who served in Afghanistan, had confessed to killing his wife Andrea Crew, 31, and throwing her in the Occoquan River last year.

Friends said that the ex-Marine had been abusive towards his wife, a Colombian native and the mother of their daughters, aged four years old and 11 months old. 

In July 2013, police received a 911 call from the family home in Fairfax where Mrs Crew said that her husband poured motor oil over her, News 4 reported. 

He was charged with domestic violence but at a court hearing but his wife agreed to drop the charges against him.   

During a fight on the way home in the car on August 7, the mother-of-two threatened to call 911 again.

The Marine admitted he then strangled his wife with his tie in a parking lot, telling her 'goodbye', the Washington Post reported. 

He dumped her body in the woods and later that night went back to put her body in a bag, weighing her down with dumbbells and granite. He threw her in the river along the interstate. 

He reported his wife missing to police the following day.

Her body was found in the river by a person on a boat a week later and Crew was arrested.

According to police, the couple had argued over money and the mother had suggested taking their daughters to live in South America. 

He is due to be sentenced at a later and will face up to 20 years in prison.
