After a kissing couple, a set of Olympic rings and a larger-than-lifesize statue of Poet Laureate John Betjeman, this is the latest piece of giant art that from today floats dozens of feet above those passing through London's St Pancras Station.

If travellers look up towards the iconic roof they will see Lucy and Jorge Orta's 'Cloud : Meteoros', with a group of grey figures riding them across the sky.

St Pancras has become home to a series of large art installations, including Paul Day’s The Lovers and Martin Jennings’s statue of Betjeman – alongside the much loved Olympic Rings which graced the station until just after London 2012.

These new clouds of metal represent: 'The intermediary between two worlds – between reality and the imagined, 
between heaven and earth, between lightness and gravity,' according to the artists.

They will be in place until the end of 2013 for those heading to and from Europe or the East Midlands to enjoy as they travel through.
