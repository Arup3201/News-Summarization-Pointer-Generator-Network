At least 71 iPads went missing last year from the Los Angeles Unified School District. The lost devices, worth a total of just over $48k, are among the iPads used in a 13-school trial run of a $1 billion program designed to improve education. 

If all goes according to plan, the program will supply 640,000 students, or every student in LA's school system, with the costly Apple tablet for free by 2014.

The bulk of the 71 missing devices worth $678 each, disappeared from one school called Valley Academy of Arts and Sciences in Granada Hills, California. Approximately 1,200 iPads were distributed to the school last year. By year's end, 69 were unaccounted for.

While the 71 missing iPads have been linked to the students assigned to each tablet, according to the Los Angeles Times, 'if students claim they turned in their device, the district may have no way to prove otherwise.'

Despite the dissapearance of 71 iPads from LA school district, 640,000 students in California will eventually receive free Apple tablets for educational purposes.

But the loss of approximately $48k in iPads has not deterred the LA Unified School District from their plan to put iPads in every students hands by next year.

Officials told the LA Times that since the thefts, new security measures were implemented to keep track of the tablets, intended to be sent home with students.'We have a very vigorous control for this rollout,' said Lt. Jose Santome of the school district's Police Department. 'We know what's going out and deployed on every campus.'

As part of the rollout about 14,000 iPads have been distributed so far this year in 49 of the district's K-12 schools.

The rollout could be delayed for a while, however. Recently the district banned home use of the iPads after nearly 300 students figured out how to alter the security settings so they could surf the Web and access social media sites.

The LA Times reported that disappointed students, who wanted to visit music and social networking sites, 'quickly figured out how to delete safeguards.'

'As a result, students were able to visit any website when they used the tablets off campus.'

In response, school authorities have suspended home use of district iPads for a unspecified amount of time.

Officials are looking for ways to ensure students use the devices, pre-loaded with educational 
applications,for school purposes only. 

According to CiteWorld, the $1 billion initiative was devised when educators came to the conclusion that computer technologies are necessary in every field of work.

'We are making sure that everyone is able to take a test electronically,' said  Mark Hovatter, the chief facilities executive for the LA Unified School District.

'Even in construction, you can't do those jobs now without having some familiarity with computers. Whatever jobs kids want to have, technology is likely involved. You're just not going to be able to do well in society if you don't have some experience.'
