It was May 2012 when Stewart Downing last pulled on an England shirt, but his renaissance at West Ham this season gives credible cause to believe he can once again be part of Roy Hodgson’s plans.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce insisted his player is in the thoughts of the England manager and deserved to receive a call-up for this month’s internationals due to his versatility and ability.

Downing scored and assisted after moving from the wing to a central role as West Ham clawed back a point on Saturday having trailed 2-0. He delivered a superb deep cross for Enner Valencia to head in, then struck a late equaliser with a firm right-foot shot.

Downing has not played for England since 2012, but there have been calls for him to return to the squad

At 30, he has been a key reason for West Ham recording their best start to a campaign since 2000, creating 30 chances for team-mates. Only Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas (35) and Southampton’s Dusan Tadic (31) can post better numbers in this department.

England play Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier on November 15 before welcoming Scotland to Wembley in a friendly three days later. Hodgson watched Downing in the victory over champions Manchester City just over a week ago.

‘If he picks me it would be unbelievable, I’d love to play for England,’ said Downing. ‘The main thing for me is that I’ve got to keep playing well and if I can nick goals and create, it gives him a problem to think about.

‘We’ll see what happens. I know he’s been to games and is watching us. If he picks me, great. If not, I’ll just carry on.’

Allardyce added: ‘If they need a central midfield player either in the three or in the hole, it’s well worth having a look at him the way he’s played this year. He’s not under the radar for England. Roy will have everybody on the radar, believe you me.

‘They have already recognised that Stewart has taken a different position.

‘Whether that fits into his shape of play that’s up to Roy to decide, but certainly Stewart is making big strides to say, “Here I am, I’m playing really, really well”.’

Stoke manager Mark Hughes plans to speak to PGMOL, the body that governs referees, after Alex Song escaped a red card despite a two-foot lunge at Mame Biram Diouf.

Hughes was incensed as West Ham scored their first goal 22 seconds after the incident with referee Chris Foy failing to even see a foul.

‘We’ll ask about it because it’s a poor decision,’ said Hughes. ‘We are not trying to get people into trouble. We’d just like observations about that. Our view is that the game should have been stopped.’

This display was arguably Stoke’s best performance of the campaign so far, with Diouf, Bojan, Victor Moses and Jon Walters a menace throughout.

Moses opened the scoring — and his Stoke City account — with a scrambled finish from close range, and Diouf doubled the lead with a header from Walters’s cross.

Hughes paid tribute to Bojan, who showed his potential after a difficult start to his time in England. ‘He’s sat out games and he’s watched and learned. You saw today that he’s going to be a good player for us.’
