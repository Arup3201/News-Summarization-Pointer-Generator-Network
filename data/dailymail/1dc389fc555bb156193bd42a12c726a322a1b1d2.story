Sky scrapers: Lasers could be used to divert weather away from events - or trigger rainfall far out to see

We may have all dreamt of zapping away the rainclouds when it’s damp and miserable outside. But it seems that one day, the dream could actually come true.

Scientists are hopeful that lasers could be used to guarantee a cloudless sky – and will gather next month to discuss the possibility of shooting pulses of light into the heavens to control the weather.

In laboratory tests Swiss researchers have succeeded in using the technology to promote cloud formation. In theory, it could be used to trigger rainfall far out at sea or over uninhabited land – and keep it away from a major event.

The technique has also been used to control lightning, with the long-term aim of diverting it away from built-up areas.

Controlling the weather has been attempted before, most famously during the 2008 Beijing Olympics when scientists apparently fired chemicals into the sky to disperse cloud for the opening ceremony.

Known as cloud ‘seeding’, it was pioneered in the US in the 1940s and involves inducing rain by firing silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud, simulating the natural salt, dust and other tiny particles in the atmosphere that help water droplets form.

It has produced mixed results, but at a conference of the World Meteorological Organisation entitled Laser, Weather and Climate, a team from the University of Geneva will report on experiments in which they used lasers to cause water to condense or ice to form, crucial in accelerating rainfall.

In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they reported: ‘Under conditions typical for thin cirrus ice clouds, the plasma channels [laser] induced a surprisingly strong effect of ice multiplication.

Within a few minutes, the laser action led to a strong enhancement of the total ice particle number density in the chamber by up to a factor of 100.

Rain stop play? British music festivals - notoriously damp - might benefit from the new technology, though these Reading veterans don't seem to mind

‘The newly formed ice particles quickly reduced the water vapour pressure to  ice saturation, thereby increasing the  cloud optical thickness by up to three orders of magnitude.’

They said the results ‘open the possibility for laser modification of natural cirrus clouds or the artificial seeding of cirrus clouds’.
