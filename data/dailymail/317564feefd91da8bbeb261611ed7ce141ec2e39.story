A senior Justice Department official told a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on Thursday that several agencies including the FBI are investigating partisan political activity inside the IRS, and that former official Lois Lerner's disappearing emails are on the menu.

A criminal investigation, Deputy Attorney General James Cole testified, 'is being conducted by career attorneys and agents of the Department’s Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

Cole declined to provide lawmakers with details about what the DOJ has uncovered.

'I can, however, tell you,' he added, 'that the investigation includes investigating the circumstances of the lost emails from Ms.Lerner’s computer.'

Lerner, who led the IRS division tasked with vetting and monitoring tax-exempt nonprofits until her retirement late last year, is Republicans' central bête noire in the controversy over how her sub-agency targeted conservative groups with aggressive scrutiny and years-long delays when they applied for the coveted charitable status.

Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the House Oversight Committee on Thursday that the Justice Department's investigation into the IRS tea party targeting scandal includes a probe into Lois Lerner's missing emails

Lerner (R) headed the IRS division that policed nonprofit groups, and is accused of purposely targeting right-wing organizations for unusually intrusive scrutiny

Republicans on the oversight committee hit the roof when IRS Commissioner John Koskinen confirmed last month that years' worth of Lerner's government emails, which they had been demanding since 2013, were casualties in a hard drive crash.

Koskinen drew gasps during a congressional hearing when he acknowledged that after forensic experts failed to retrieve the emails, the agency recycled the drive – rendering it permanently unavailable to investigators in the legislative branch of government.

He also admitted, under questioning by Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, that the IRS failed to look at a backup tape that could have provided copies of Lerner's emails for a six-month period.

Cole's statement on Thursday is the first indication that the Obama administration may have moved with purpose to probe what happened, despite the GOP's hints at a partisan slow-walk – or, worse, a cover-up in which Lerner herself destroyed evidence of her alleged wrongdoing.

Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

On July 9 he released a statement claiming that his client 'did not destroy any records subject to the Federal Records Act, she did not cause the computer assigned to her to fail, and she made every effort to recover the files on the computer.'

Although Republicans learned of the email losses in June, her hard drive crashed in 2011.

Some Republicans believe the data loss as happened at too opportune a time to have been an accident: Just days earlier, the GOP had begun publicly questioning the IRS's partisan activity.

That was two years before Lerner herself outed the program by answering a planted question at a conference for tax professionals in May 2013. Her admission presaged a report, long in the making, that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released days later.

That same year, a surviving email shows, Lerner cautioned her colleagues and underlings to communicate via instant message instead of by email, because the latter would be open to congressional inquiries.

Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan reacted to Cole's written testimony late on Wednesday, telling The Wall Street Journal that it was overdue.

'Finally, someone in the administration admits that the destruction of two years of emails from Lois Lerner is fishy,' Jordan said.

Clash: Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R) has continually crossed swords with Democrat Elijah Cummings (L) over the question of whether Lerner can claim Fifth Amendment privileges and refuse to testify about her agency's partisan activities

Like other Republicans, Jordan wants the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor instead of relying on its own lawyers to conduct the investigation.

That seems unlikely, as Cole's appearance at Thursday's hearing appears calculated in part to quell conservatives' fears about the DOJ's impartiality.

'This whole thing is about Democrats in power abusing Republicans,' a senior staffer to an Oversight Committee Republican member told MailOnline on Thursday morning. 'Why would we trust that another agency in the same administration will behave any better?'

Lerner raised the GOP's temperature at a May 2013 committee hearing when she offered a self-serving opening statement before refusing to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

Attorneys working for the committee's GOP majority later determined that she had waived that right by offering an oral defense that wasn't subject to cross-examination.

Republicans have since pushed a Contempt of Congress resolution through the House of Representatives, citing her refusal to answer questions while under subpoena.

One conservative member, Steve Stockman of Texas, proposed last week that the House sergeant-at-arms should arrest her.
