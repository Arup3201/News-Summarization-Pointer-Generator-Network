High-fiving Sir Tom Jones in front of nine million TV viewers, she seemed to have the world, or at least the music industry, at her feet.

A year on, some fans of The Voice may struggle to remember Leanne Mitchell’s name.

As the BBC1 talent show returns for a second season tonight, sources have privately admitted its first winner has been a disappointment…and even Sir Tom thinks it would have been better if she hadn’t won.

Reluctant star: Leanne Mitchell, 29, pictured with Sir Tom Jones on The Voice, has enjoyed limited success since winning the BBC singing competition last year

The 29-year-old, who still lives in a semi-detached bungalow in Lowestoft, Suffolk, failed to enter the top 40 with her first single.

Almost a year since her victory she hasn’t released an album or been on tour – calling into question the credibility of a programme that boasts it is a springboard for musical success.

Members of the former holiday camp entertainer’s management team told the Daily Mail she appears to be a reluctant star who has refused to co-operate with publicity opportunities to boost her profile and failed to work as hard as The Voice runners up Bo Bruce and Tyler James.

A source said: ‘Leanne is wary of fame and doesn’t aspire to be a massive star. She just wants to sing. Unfortunately for her, you have to promote yourself if you want people to buy your music.’

Meanwhile Sir Tom, who returns as a coach this weekend after mentoring Miss Mitchell to victory last year, accused her record label, Universal Music, of mismanaging her career.

Asked why she has failed to make a mark in the music industry, he said: ‘I think they [Universal] rushed it.

‘The one problem is if you win The Voice, it’s out of your hands completely. Because you’re signed to Universal Records, with management, agency, the whole thing.

‘So you can’t do much for that person after you’ve got that person to win. If you want to do something with them further, it’s better that they don’t win.’

Miss Mitchell’s only release to date, a cover of Run To You by Whitney Houston, was a flop, selling just 7,000 copies last June and reaching number 45 in the charts.

By contrast, all nine winners of The Voice’s ITV rival, The X Factor, have recorded number one singles at their first attempt.

She suffered further disappointment in September when the show’s official live tour, due to showcase its eight finalists, was cancelled following poor ticket sales.

Her debut album – called Leanne Mitchell – was originally set for release in April but has been postponed until May 27.

Some of last year’s runners-up, including Tyler James (left) and Bo Bruce (right), have enjoyed more success

Perhaps surprisingly, given her young age and lack of starting career success, the singer will release an autobiography, entitled Finding My Voice, on April 18.

A source on the BBC show said: ‘Leanne’s trajectory since The Voice has been a disappointment. She has not been the best advert for the show.’

Some of last year’s runners-up appear to have achieved far more. Bo Bruce, 28, saw a re-release of her 2010 single Search The Night reach number two in the online charts a week after The Voice ended last year. She subsequently signed to Mercury Records.

Comeback: The Voice returns to screens this weekend after a disappointing start

Tyler James, 28, signed a deal with Island Records and regularly plays at gigs around the country.

His debut single, Single Tear, peaked at number 28 in the charts last October, while his album, A Place I Go, reached 47.

Mr
James’ coach on The Voice, Will.i.am, said: ‘The public voted for 
Leanne, but the best artist does not always get the most votes.’

Miss Mitchell declined to comment when she was approached by the Daily Mail.
