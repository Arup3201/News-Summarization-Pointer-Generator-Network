Ryanair passengers rejoice - the no-frills airline is dropping the bugle blast it plays at the end of every flight that arrives on time.

The flier has given in to people power after holding a vote via Twitter on whether or not to keep the annoying refrain, whose official name is First Call and is used in the army.

Customers overwhelmingly voted to ditch the tune, a taped version of which is played over the speakers each time a flight lands on time.

On time: Ryanair plans the bugle noise every time it lands on schedule

Over the years customers of the Dublin based carrier have regularly complained, labelling the end of flight bugle call as 'annoying' or 'cheesy'.

One even said it made her embarrassed to be Irish.

Ryanair said it would drop the bugle following the Twitter vote, although it refused to say whether or not it would replace it with something else.

The move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline's famously belligerent attitude to criticism.

Huge criticism: Ryanair asked on Twitter whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time

This has included introducing quiet times on flights, with fewer announcements early morning or late night.

It has also followed some of its budget rivals by allowed allocated seating, fewer restrictions on luggage and an improved website for bookings.

Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: 'We asked our followers on Twitter to vote on whether we should change it.

'The people have spoken and after hundreds of votes, they've voted for change, so we're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon.'Â
