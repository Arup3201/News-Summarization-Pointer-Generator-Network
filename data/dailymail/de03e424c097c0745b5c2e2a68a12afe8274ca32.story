A man has pleaded not guilty to the death and dismemberment of a stripper he knew in New Orleans' French Quarter.

Terry Speaks, 42, and his girlfriend Margaret Sanchez, 30, are charged with second-degree murder after allegedly stabbing 22-year-old Jaren Lockhart in the back during a 'private party' at their apartment.

The mother-of-one's body, which was cut into pieces and dropped in the Mississippi Sound, washed up on to Bay St Louis beaches days after she was last seen on June 6, 2012.

Charged: Terry Speaks (center, wearing glasses) has denied murdering a stripper. He is pictured returning to New Orleans to appear in court after serving a two-year jail term for an unrelated sex offense in New York

Today, Speaks appeared in Jefferson Parish court days after completing a two-year sentence in a New York federal prison for an unrelated sexual offense.

Speaks spoke only to deny the charges of murder and obstruction of justice, which were brought against him by a grand jury three months ago, NOLA reported.

He also is charged with failure to register as a sex offender in Jefferson Parish after being convicted in North Carolina in 2003 of having sex with a minor.  

After meeting with his court-appointed attorney for the first time, Speaks returned to the parish jail, where he is being held on a $1.75 million bond. 

Speaks and Sanchez are the last people known to have seen Lockhart alive. 

Killed: Mother-of-one Jaren Lockhart, 22, was found washed up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in June 2012

Footage: Lockhart was last seen in this CCTV footage leaving the Bourbon strip club with Speaks and Sanchez

They were caught after a large-scale investigation spanning two states and involving multiple law enforcement agencies. 

CCTV footage shows the three leaving the Bourbon Street club where Lockhart worked on June 6, 2012.

Friends say Lockhart told them she was going 'to make rent'.

Days later, her torso, arms, legs and head washed up at various points along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Also accused: Speaks's girlfriend Margaret Sanchez, 30, is also accused of second-degree murder

Margaret Sanchez, who is also accused of second-degree murder, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice, will be tried separately. 

Sanchez, also jailed, is held under a $1.25 million bond.

Both are due back in court on November 17 and will be tried separately, clerks say.
