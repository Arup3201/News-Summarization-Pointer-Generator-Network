Napoli manager Rafa Benitez will be in charge of a new team next season.

Benitez, 54, has had spells with Liverpool and Chelsea in the Premier League and has most recently been linked with the vacant role at Newcastle with his contract in Serie A expiring at the end of the season.

Benitez could be on his way back to England after it was confirmed he turned down the chance to lead the Peru national team to focus on club management.

The South American country wanted Benitez to lead them to the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

'In Peru, they can forget about Benitez,' his agent Manuel Garcia Quilon was quoted as saying in the Mirror. 'He will not be a national coach but will coach at another club.'

Benitez will be out of contract in the summer, despite winning the Italian Super Cup with Napoli last month.

The former Real Madrid and Valencia boss is well respected in England, having won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.

Benitez was an unpopular appointment among Chelsea fans but won the Europa League in 2013 at the end of his short spell with the club.
