The boy, along with four members of his family, was injured after they were struck by a car this morning, West Midlands Ambulance Service said.

The incident happened on Nineveh Road in Handsworth, Birmingham, around 8.20am.

The boy has been taken to Birmingham Children’s Hospital with injuries to his face and a fractured arm.

A mother and four children were struck by the Vauxhall Corsa on their way to school in Birmingham today

Eye witness David Hart said the car seemed to appear from nowhere knocking the family down 'like skittles'

Specialist crash investigators examined the scene to try and determine the cause of the rush-hour collision

His mother and three other children were taken to City Hospital for further treatment following the crash.

Businessman David Hart, 45, who witnessed the crash, said: 'The car 
appeared to come from nowhere and hit the woman and her kids like they 
were skittles.

'I was so shocked, I immediately thought it must be a 
fatal crash but was so relieved when I heard the kids crying because at 
least it meant they were alive.

'It’s a miracle no one was more badly hurt. It looked an awful collision.'

The driver of the car was uninjured in the incident.

West Midlands Police said the Nineveh Road in Handsworth would remain closed for several hours

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'Crews arrived to find significant traffic disruption at the scene following a collision between a car and five pedestrians.

'Reports at the scene suggested one patient, a seven-year-old boy, had been dragged underneath the car for approximately 50ft, leading to serious injuries.

'Following assessment from crews, he was treated for injuries to his face and a fractured arm. He was given pain relief at the scene before being taken on alert to Birmingham Children’s Hospital. A doctor travelled with the boy to continue administering emergency treatment en route.

'Four other patients also required treatment on scene from medics before being taken to City Hospital, Birmingham.

West Midlands Police confirmed they have already spoken to the female driver who was uninjured in the crash

'A woman, the mother of the family, was treated for leg injuries and a dislocated shoulder. Two other boys were injured in the incident, one suffering shoulder and back pain whilst the other had arm injuries.

'One further patient, a girl, was treated for leg and hip pain before being taken to hospital.

'The driver of the car was uninjured, but shaken, following the incident. She was discharged at scene following assessment.'

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said they were continuing to investigate the circumstances of the incident.

'Emergency services were called to a collision involving a red Vauxhall Corsa and pedestrians in Nineveh Road, Handsworth just before 8.30am this morning.

'Nineveh Road is currently closed between Victoria Road and Tew Park Road while police investigate the circumstances of the collision.'
