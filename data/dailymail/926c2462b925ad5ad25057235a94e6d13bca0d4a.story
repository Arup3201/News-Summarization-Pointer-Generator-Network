A four-year-old boy who plunged 230ft down a cliff and somehow survived has awoken from a coma after 10 days.

Sebastion Johnson was walking along a coastal path in Bodega Bay, California, with his parents when he fell on to a rocky beach, but was miraculously still alive when rescuers found him.

The child, dubbed 'miracle monkey' by his mother, is slowly regaining strength and is on track to make a full recovery.

Sebastion and his parents Daryl Johnson and Jamie Guglielmino were on a family outing on a trail in Bodega Bay earlier this month when he tumbled over the cliff edge.

Firefighters spotted him at the beach at the bottom of the cliff and rappelled down to rescue him, with the coastguard setting off flares to guide them through the darkness and down on to the rocks.

Remarkably Sebastion was awake and crying when the rescuers reached the stricken four-year-old, who was rushed to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital in a critical condition.

He had broken both hips, a leg, an arm and his jaw and was put in a medically-induced coma.

Finally, 10 days later, Sebastion awoke from his coma and has since regained the strength to hold his mother's hand, Today reported.

Ms Guglielmino said: 'Like angels guided him down. He fell 23 stories and survived. He's the boy that lived.

'I'm amazed that he pulled through. We've given him the nickname miracle monkey.

'All he knows is that he’s in pain and mommy’s there,' Guglielmino told ABC. 

'He looks at me. I can tell in his eyes, like, "Where am I mommy?"'

Sebastion, who has been out of his coma for five days, is still hooked up to tubes in hospital and is unlikely to be discharged soon, but he is on the road to recovery, doctors have said.

Speaking of the moment she realised her son had fallen off the cliff, Ms Guglielmino said: 'It was frustrating and terrible. I was torn apart.

'We were walking along the path throwing rocks and he fell down the cliff.'

Mr Johnson said: 'I wanted to jump off and grab him and make sure he was alive.

'He just misstepped and the ground gave and he just flew right down. The incident that happened was my worst nightmare.'

Fire Captain Justin Fox said at the time: 'He was at the water line and it was low tide. If it was high tide, he wouldn't have been easy to find.'  

The four-year-old's rescue at Bodega Bay was the second in three days after a woman, 23, slipped 20ft while climbing rocks in Bodega Head.
