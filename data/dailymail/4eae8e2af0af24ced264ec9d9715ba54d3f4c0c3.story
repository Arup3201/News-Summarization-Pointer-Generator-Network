The Liberal Democrats have been left all shook up after being beaten by the Elvis Party in a by-election.

More voters backed a candidate calling for a 30 per cent discount in brothels for OAPs than Nick Clegg’s party in the election to Nottingham City Council.

It is the latest embarrassment for the Lib Dems, who have also struggled in several Commons by-elections in recent months.

The Bus-Pass Elvis Party beat the Lib Dems by 11 votes in the Nottingham City Council by-election

David Bishop from Bus-Pass Elvis Party managed to beat the Lib Dems into fifth place

Voters went to the polls yesterday to elect a new councillor in the Clifton North ward.

Labour's Patricia Ferguson held the seat, where the other two councillors are Tories.

Labour secured 1,179 votes, with the Conservative Andrew Rule taking 1,025. Ukip’s Kevin Clarke came third with 536 votes.

In fourth place was David Bishop, from the Bus-Pass Elvis Party, who secured 67 votes, 11 more than Lib Dem Tony Marshall who managed just 56.

David Bishop stood on a manifesto to legalise brothels, and give OAPs a 30 per cent discount

A Lib Dem spokesman said he was ‘all 
shook up’ by the result. ‘I think this is a campaign where we were 
accused of having Suspicious Minds,’ he added. ‘We have been left in 
Heartbreak Hotel as a result.’

The
 Bus-Pass Elvis Party is also known as Elvis Loves Pets, Church of the 
Militant Elvis and Elvis and the Yeti Himalayan Preservation Party.

It was founded in 2001 by Mr Bishop to ‘overthrow the Corporate Capitalist State which turned Elvis, a man of immense talent, into a fat media joke’.

Mr Bishop, who also calls himself Lord Biro, stood on a manifesto who promised to ‘legalise brothels with a 30% reduction for OAPs’.

He also called for an inquiry in British Vet Fees, a ban on air guns and a campaign to ‘save public lavatories from extinction’.

It added: ‘Nigel Farage recently said he would like to see a relaxation of the rules on Hand Gun ownership.

‘Our candidate hopes he and his party never come into power as Nottingham will be worse than Dodge City.

‘If they do come into power our candidate will write to Clint Eastwood and ask him to be the Deputy Sheriff of Nottingham.’

Mr Bishop has previously stood against disgraced Tory MP Neil Hamilton, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and Ukip’s Robert Kilroy Silk.

David Bishop stood in the Eastleigh parliamentary by-election last year, but was beaten by Monster Raving Loony Howling Laud Hope

The retired painter and decorator stood in the Eastleigh parliamentary by-election last year, triggered by the resignation of Lib Dem Cabinet minister Chris Huhne.

Mr Bishop came 11th, behind the Beer, Baccy and Crumpet party and the Monster Raving Loony party.
