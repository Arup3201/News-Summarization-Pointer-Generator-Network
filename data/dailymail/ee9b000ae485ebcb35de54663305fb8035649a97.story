Donald Sterling has stepped back from his defensive stance and agreed to pass controls of the LA Clippers basketball team to his wife.

Donald Sterling and his estranged wife Shelly have joint ownership of the basketball team and the NBA made it clear that they were going to push for Donald to sell his portion in light of his racist recordings.

Shelly has repeatedly announced that she has no plans to sell her portion of the team and she felt that she is in no position to be forced to sell her stake since it was her husband who made the racist comments while unknowingly being recorded by an alleged girlfriend.

Throwing in the towel: Donald Sterling has reportedly handed over the control of his half of the NBA basketball team to his wife Shelly, who had control of the other half

Negotiations: Shelly Sterling, seen here with her attorney Pierce O'Donnell, has been in talks with the NBA ever since her husband's racist recordings were leaked in hopes that she can keep her half of the team

TMZ first reported on Friday that Donald has surrendered his controlling stake of the team and given it to his wife, which comes after repeated assertions that he would do no such thing.

Shelly and her team of lawyers has reportedly been negotiating with the NBA separately from her husband since the scandal broke in an effort to insure that she is not faced with a force sale like her husband after he was issued a lifetime ban from professional basketball. 

'Shelly Sterling's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the NBA in a mutually satisfactory manner,' her lawyer Pierce O'Donnell told TMZ, though he would not say anything further about the details of the sale.

ESPN reports that the NBA has not formally accepted this arrangement and she may be forced to sell the team as one whole unit rather than being able to keep her own shares.

NBC reported shortly after that Shelly has agreed to voluntarily agreed to sell the team. CNN followed up with a confirmation from an unidentified source familiar with the situation.

The announcement comes after the NBA 
filed charges that would force Sterling to terminate his ownership of 
the team, and he was given five days to determine his response.

That
 deadline would expire on Tuesday, but he appears to have come to a 
decision with a few days to spare- though it is not official whether or 
not the NBA will accept his move, though it does seem likely considering
 what NBA commissioner Adam Silver said at a press conference earlier 
this week.

'Shelly Sterling's preference has always been to find a way to resolve this dispute amicably with the NBA in a mutually satisfactory manner'

              -Pierce O'Donnell, her attorney

'It is 
their team to sell, and so he knows what the league’s point of view is, 
and so I’m sure if he wanted to sell the team on some reasonable 
timetable, I’d prefer he sell it than we go through this process. So if 
that’s what you mean by man‑to‑man, I’m open to that,' Silver said.

They already ruled against his first request, which was to have a three month delay to evaluate his options, but it comes as no surprise that the NBA denied this as they hope to put the issue behind them for fear of losing fan support and the threat of a player walkout.

Two other reasons for why the Sterlings may have been motivated to sell rather than bring the issue to a vote among the owners is that the owners may have convinced them that it would be worse for the league to do so.

The clearest reason, however, is that the longer the Sterlings are associated with the team, the lower the team's selling price will be as sponsors continue to stay away from the Clippers and the players themselves are less likely to want to stay on board if there is no indication that the Sterlings will cut ties.

One deadline on the horizon is the NBA draft in late June. The team would be less appealing to prospective players if the Sterlings are still associated with the team at that point, or if there is no clear sign that they are in the process of extracting themselves from the leadership positions.

Speculation of who may buy the team continues to swirl, as moguls Oprah Winfrey, Larry Ellison and David Geffen have been reportedly considering the purchase, which is expected to have a price tag of about $1billion.
