Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has become the first player in Barclays Premier League history to get at least 15 assists in two seasons.

The former Arsenal star picked up his 15th assist since joining Chelsea from Barcelona during the summer against Swansea City in a 5-0 win at the Liberty Stadium.

Fabregas started the record at Arsenal in the 2007-08 season with 17 assists, though Arsene Wenger's men could only finish third behind Chelsea and champions Manchester United  that year.

21 appearances (1,851 minutes)

2 goals (18 shots)

15 assists

67 chances created

1,807 passes (87% completion)

36 dribbles (61% completion)

This time, starting a move and finishing it by setting up Diego Costa against Swansea, Fabregas moved within five of Thierry Henry's all-time record of 20, which was set 12 seasons ago.

The Spain international could and should have had his 16th, too, when a sublime half-volley from deep in his own half gave Costa a one-on-one, but the Chelsea striker could not finish.

Yet still Fabregas looks a shoo-in to break Henry's record this year as he helps Chelsea close in on the Premier League title ahead of reigning champions Manchester City.
