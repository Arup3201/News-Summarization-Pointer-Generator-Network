Amid the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon spa in a lava field in south-west Iceland, Lee Cattermole relaxes and reflects with his girlfriend.

Three years ago, it was he who was erupting, the then Sunderland captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in Newcastle during a night out with team-mates.

Earlier that day, Martin O’Neill had been confirmed as his new manager; it was hardly Cattermole’s wisest move and merely served to vandalise his own character.

Gus Poyet readily admits Cattermole is among the first names on his Sunderland team sheet

Current Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was certainly sceptical upon his arrival one year ago.

‘If somebody tells me this guy is a b*****d and I need to be careful, then I will be. I was told he was impossible to control, that he will get sent off a hundred times and he will let you down,’ says Poyet.

‘I was told he could not play football like I want to. I was told he was training on his own away from everybody else. I thought I’d meet Lee and he’d have a gun and he’d shoot me in the head.’

Twelve months on and Poyet readily admits that Cattermole is the first name on his team sheet. 

The 26-year-old has just been voted North East Football Writers’ Player of 2014 and the manager is backing his on-field lieutenant for an England call-up — ‘In Uruguay, he would be the hero, the captain,’ he says.

The respect is mutual. Cattermole says he has come a long way in 12 months under Poyet.

‘In the last year I have learned a hell of a lot,’ says the anchorman.

Poyet took over as manager of Sunderland in October 2013 and continues to work with Cattermole

‘Gus coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award, which I’m chuffed about. Gus is very much my kind of person, very English minded.

‘It is totally different playing under Gus than any other manager. I think he played street football a lot more. He almost taught himself, which is why he was a very natural player.

‘And he has told me in no uncertain terms that, in the position I play, if I don’t do what he wants then I won’t play. On and off the pitch this is as good as I have ever felt. The manager has stuck with me.’

As Cattermole suggests, off the pitch was a big issue — there was a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown of Stockton in 2008.

‘I have calmed down off the pitch as well as on it,’ he says. ‘I had a couple of incidents during my career which people have read too much into.

‘I have just matured and I even have a girlfriend now. When anyone is 26 they look back to when they were 18 and there is a world of difference — and I am no different.’

Indeed, pubs have made way for geothermal spas and romantic getaways in Nordic lava land.

Cattermole — and Poyet — will be hoping his days of boiling over are a thing of the past.

Cattermole says he has 'matured' at Sunderland and puts it in no small way down to Poyet's management
