From the gallstones of an Acid Bath Murderer victim to execution ropes used in the 19th century, these exhibits are among the most unusual and macabre you could find in Britain.

And now a selection of 500 items from Scotland Yard's Crime Museum, known as the 'Black Museum' for its grisly collection of memorabilia, is set to go on public display for the first time.

Among the 20,000 exhibits at the museum - open only to serving police and select guests since it was founded in 1874 - is the gun used by murderer Ruth Ellis, the last woman executed in Britain.

Other items include death masks of people hanged at Newgate prison, casts of their rope-scarred necks and the severed arms of a murderer thought to have killed himself in Germany in the 1950s.

Part of this collection will go on display at the Museum of London in October, including masks worn by the first criminals convicted in the UK for murder based on fingerprint evidence.

This came in 1905 when the Stratton brothers, who robbed and killed an elderly tradesman in Deptford, south-east London, were sentenced to death after a bloody fingerprint was discovered.

Also in the set forming the Crime Museum Uncovered exhibition is a briefcase with a syringe and poison thatIn addition, the public will be able to see a talcum powder tin used to conceal microfilm by members of a Russian spy ring in 1961, and drinks cans used in drug smuggling that police have seized.

Magnifying glass and scissors: A forensics kit used by crime scene investigators, which is among the 20,000 exhibits at the Black Museum - open only to serving police and select guests since it was founded in 1874

Hidden device: The public will soon be able to visit the Museum of London and see a talcum powder tin used to conceal microfilm by members of a Russian spy ring called the Krogers in 1961

'You can do it': Pilsner lager and Diet Pepsi drinks cans used in drug smuggling that police have seized - which now form part of the 'Black Museum' - known as such for its grisly collection of memorabilia

Shrapnel from an unexploded Fenian bomb found at London Paddington railway station in 1884 will also feature, as well as a forensics kit used by police attending crime scenes.

There will be various items relating to the 1949 killing of 69-year-old wealthy widow Olive Durand-Deacon by John Haigh - known for dissolving his victims in sulphuric acid - including her handbag, gloves and gallstones.

Also on show will be personal possessions of Ronnie Biggs and other members of the Great Train Robbery gang recovered from their hideaway at Leatherslade Farm in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 1963.

These include Andrews liver salts, a bottle of Old Spice aftershave, a mug and a tub of Saxa salt.

Julia Hoffbrand, co-curator of the Museum of London's exhibition, told The Independent: ‘We want to give people the sense of how it started, how it was really cluttered. 

Blast: Shrapnel from an unexploded Fenian bomb found at London Paddington station. The inscription says: 'Found at Paddington station (Great Western Railway), February 1884, in a suitcase filled with dynamite'

'It’s evoking the feel and atmosphere from the start of the Crime Museum.’

Her colleague Jackie Keily told The Guardian: ‘The term "silent witness" is often bandied about, but these objects really are the witnesses to generations of crimes, and each has a story to tell.’

She added that a decision was made on what to show at the Museum of London after talks with Metropolitan Police curators, victims' representatives and the London Policing Ethics Panel.

The Crime Museum was set up by an Inspector Neame in 1874 so new officers could see tools of the criminal trade, such as guns disguised as walking sticks and umbrellas.

Despite being officially closed to the public, a select group of VIPs have been allowed to view the collection - including author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, magician Harry Houdini and comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.

Several visitors, including serving officers, have been known to faint at the museum - which is currently held in room 101 at the Met's Victoria Street headquarters near St James's Park.

Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: ‘The artefacts held in the museum will provide visitors with an insight into the evolution of crime investigation and criminal justice.

‘The public will view exhibits from some of the most complex and indeed notorious criminal investigations carried out by the Met, and discover how such crimes were solved.’
