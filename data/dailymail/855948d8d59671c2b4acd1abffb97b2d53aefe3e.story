Relive Sportsmail's minute-by-coverage of England's clash against South Africa as Stuart Lancaster's side looked for their first win from the Autumn internationals. 

Host commentator

It may have looked close, but England were a long way behind South Africa today. The winless run is now up to 12 games against the Springboks, and surely Stuart Lancaster needs to change things against Samoa next week.

80mins: It nearly gets worse for South Africa, but La Roux knocks the ball on before celebrating scoring.

78mins: Just like last week against New Zealand, it seems as though England are going to be beaten by the clock.

Seconds remain, as Brad Barritt goes over in the corner - but George Ford misses the tricky conversion.

76mins: And that, should be that. The visitors build some pressure in England's half and the ball is placed back for Lambie, who has kicked well all day, to send home a drop goal.

England have been galvanised by their replacement half-backs. Ben Youngs has added tempo and energy behind the pack and George Ford has already shown his willingness to take the ball to the line and challenge the opposition at close quarters.

As a result, England have started finding spaces and they have reignited the crowd. A grandstand finish is in prospect.

 

71mins: Sin-bin is over! Can England fight back and score that crucial try?

67mins: Perfect restart from England and 21-year-old George Ford sends the ball over the posts.

66mins: Now England could be in trouble. South Africa opt for the three points instead of kicking for the corner and Lambie holds his nerve.

Significant changes - interesting with Ford now - must play territory, the chance of winning is through driving play.

64mins: George Ford and Ben Youngs on, Owen Farrell and Danny Care off.

61mins: Now it's England's turn to readjust after a dismissal. Dylan Hartley is off for stamping on an opponent, the referee saw it, but went to the TMO to check if it was worse than he thought. It was, and the hosts are a man down.

60mins: With Attfield back on, England are struggling to penetrate this backline again. Watson and Farrell have struggled today, is it time for Yarde and Ford from the bench?

One of the reasons why England lost to New Zealand last week was because they failed to capitalise on having a numerical advantage when Dane Coles was sin-binned in the second half.

This time, with Victor Matfield in the sin-bin, the hosts seized their chance in style by scoring two tries from outstanding rolling mauls, but Schalk Burger's riposte in similar fashion at the other end has put the Springboks back in the box-seat.

54mins: They're a man down but now it's South Africa's turn to overpower the hosts! They work a line-out towards the corner and Schalk Burger can't be stopped.

Really heavy blows being landed, this is an incredible start to the second-half.

49mins: I said it was all over... what do I know! Chris Robshaw's me have really taken advantage of their, er, man advantage, and go straight through the middle yet again.

Ben Morgan surges through, and three South African defenders can't stop him powering over the line.

Game on, and the hosts want more!

45mins: Maybe this isn't over! Immediately after Attfield's dismissal Robshaw piles the pressure on the South African pack, and prop David Willson eventually goes over.

It ended up being about nine against six there, and the crowd are back up for this one.

44mins: Attfield collapses the scrum... and we all know the referee had warned him!

41mins: Wow. 43 seconds into the second-half and South Africa may have wrapped this game up...

A beautiful kick from Lambie opens up a two-on-one situation and Cobus Reinach eventually goes over for his first international try. Perfect exection, but what about the England defence?

Huge mountain to climb now.

Can England regroup, and mount a comeback here?

It could have been worse after those opening ten minutes, but ultimately a disappointing half for England.

Too many unforced errors, including one that lead to the only try, have cost them and Stuart Lancaster's side have been unable to put the visitors under any sustained pressure.

The kicking game is off once again, the handling has been poor, while the decision making has prevented the few points on offer from being scored.

35mins: England win the penalty after Billy Vunipola's attacking tap and run. Not many chances so far but enough errors from either defence to see some points being scored.

Handling errors just killing England so far - we have territory but again some attacking kicks needed to turn this defence. 

32mins: Both sides are warned by the referee that any more collapsing of the maul could result in further action, Courtney Lawes the latest culprit and Lambie makes no mistake.

Chris Foy: Steve Walsh has told the captains that there is a 'line in the sand' and the next offender will be sin-binned.

27mins: Much better spell from England, but there was a chance for more points. Attwood exploited a hole in defence and were he to unleash Watson, there was a try on offer in the corner. Instead he kept possession and the winger had to stop his run.

In the end, South Africa are penalised for not releasing and Farrell gets England on their way.

22mins: Courtney Lawes charges down a kick in South Africa's 22 but the visitors are cool and kick the pool downfield despite the pressure.

Need some points on the board.

20mins: Mike Brown surges through the defence to try and make things happen. but unforced errors mean England can't build up any sustained pressure.

Chris Foy: England have dominated territory and possession so far in this game, using their rolling maul to good effect, but now they are in early crisis mode. The home side really need the next score or the pressure levels could engulf them.

Stuart Lancaster will want to see his pack continue to use their driving game and harness Billy Vunipola's improved carrying. The irony is that they were calmly and patiently building a promising attack before Danny Care's intercepted pass gifted a try to the Springboks.

So many unforced errors - four in a row from Engalnd - and it's costing us. How good are our basic skills? 1-15 poor kicking game so far, and it's wet. We have to turn them. 

Oh dear, oh dear. England finally get their hands back on the ball again, but Danny Care's pass is intercepted by Jan Serfontein.

The centre has the whole pitch to run but is virtually unopposed; an easy try and an extremely sloppy start from England.

It's converted from in front of the posts.

Owen Farrell will be mighty relieved that his ill-advised attempt to run the ball out of his 22 only ultimately resulted in a penalty to South Africa, rather than a try. He tried to release Anthony Watson despite England being vastly out-numbered deep in their own territory and given the difficult handling conditions, he should have realised that it was a dangerous gamble.

South Africa so nearly scored a try from turn-over ball - New Zealand would have done.

10mins: All that early pressure but a mistake has surely gifted South Africa the first points.

Owen Farrell is back under his own posts to collect and could have cleared, but instead plays an inside pass to Anthony Watson despite the presence of two opposing defenders.

It's turned over, and in fact Habana nearly goes over in the corner before it's dropped.

They'll take the three.

7mins: Plenty of early territory for England. Kyle Eastmond tries his hand at storming through the defence with his pace but fumbles. Rain definitely a factor here, several knock-ons so far.

4mins: England deliver their own big hitting and earn themselves a penalty in their own half. In for some game looking at the two packs so far.

No doubt that England are in an emotionally-charged state going into this game, judging by the sight of Billy Vunipola in tears during the national anthem. The Saracens No 8 knows he needs to deliver a big performance today and he is not the only home player under pressure to deliver.

2mins: First penalty of the game and it goes South Africa's way, near their own 22. Tough tackling from the visitors and England were struggling with their hands there, perhaps because of this wet weather.

Eight years on from that last win, this is a huge chance for England to finally get one over the South Africans.

We're underway with Farrell kicking off!

Danny Care leads his team out at Twickenham on his 50th cap. Decent tache for Movember, too.

Not long now!

CHRIS FOY: Barometer readings at Twickenham are destined to soar off the scale today, as England attempt to cope with stifling, intensifying pressure while standing in the path of a thunderous South African juggernaut.

National coach Stuart Lancaster, his assistants and players are painfully aware that the stakes are rising as they engage in the second instalment of their QBE autumn Test series.

Saturday’s encounter represents the edge of an abyss. A fifth successive defeat would leave England in freefall, just when they need to be building towards next year’s World Cup.

Sir Clive Woodward, speaking on Sky Sports, says England 'have to win... so will win.'

One thing's for sure, the kicking game will have to improve.

And can Jonny May build on his performance last weekend?

Kyle Eastmond against Jean de Villiers, Anthony Watson vs Bryan Habana... how do the two teams match-up?

The players have arrived, the fans are in good spirit, the stage is set at Twickenham.

With 13 games until the World Cup (can you believe that?) this Autumn international is crucial for both England and South Africa.

Who will come out on top after last week's defeats?
