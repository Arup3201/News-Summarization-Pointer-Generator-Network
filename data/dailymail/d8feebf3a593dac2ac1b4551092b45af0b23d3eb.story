First time buyers usually prepare themselves for a leap of faith when their dream property comes on the market.

But a Chinese estate agency brought a whole new meaning to the phrase 'jumping at the chance' when it launched a bizarre marketing ploy.

A sales office in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, held a standing long jump event, giving buyers various discounts depending on how far they were able to leap.

Touchdown: a man gets ready to plant his feet after taking on a standing jump. A leap of between 2m and 2.5m would net contestants  8000 Yuan (£760)

The further the buyer jumped the bigger the discount they received.

For a discount of 5,000 Yuan (£474) the buyer had to jump 1.5m to 2m.

For a saving of 8000 Yuan (£760) the jumping distance was between 2m to 2.5m and for a distance of 2.5m you could expect a 10,000 Yuan (£950) discount.

Champion jumpers who managed more than 3m could look forward to 20,000 Yuan (£1,898) off the price of their property.

House buyers gather to take part in a standing jump at an estate agents in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province with the promise of big discounts for long leaps. 300 people took part in the event, with most saving hundreds of pounds

But the largest discount available on the day was 100,000 Yuan (£9,496) which required a distance of at least 4m.

According to the sales office 300 buyers took part and most people secured a 5,000 to 8,000 Yuan discount.

Meanwhile, a few got a 10,000 Yuan discount and one person doubled this by knocking off 20,000 Yuan with one giant leap.
