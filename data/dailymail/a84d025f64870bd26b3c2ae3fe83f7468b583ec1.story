Although Gangnam Style has been banished into one-hit-wonder heaven for quite some time across the globe, in Alaska, it's still topping the charts - at least for this furry dancer.

A large grizzly bear was spotted doing the signature moves associated with the 2012 party plague in Katmai National Park  in southern Alaska.

The bear managed to copy the routine of Psy, the South Korean rapper behind the Gangnam phenomenon, as it dried off by a river.

Although it looked as if the bear was keen get down Gangnam style, it  was in fact only drying itself off after fishing in a nearby river.

Photographer Alexey Tishchenko, 44, says he started laughing when he first saw the sequence of pictures.

‘I had been watching the bears fish for quite a while before this one decided to stand up and make its way across the shoreline,' Mr Tishchenko said.

‘I managed to get some shots of it drying itself off but I had no idea how funny they were until I checked my camera.'

Hey, sexy lady: South Korean singer Psy released Gangnam Style in 2012, which later became first ever video to reach one billion views on YouTube

‘We had been photographing the bears for quite a few hours so that they would get comfortable with our presence, our patience really paid off.

‘Bears can be very entertaining creatures, just looking at these pictures makes me realise why I enjoy photographing them so much.’

Gangnam Style became a global superhit after its release in 2012, catapulting Psy into international stardom which saw him perform all around the world and even do the signature dance with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

The video for Gangnam Style became the first ever video to reach one billion views on YouTube in December 2012, and now has more than two billion views.
