The wife of Australian cricket legend Michael Bevan has told of the moment Jane McGrath found her breast cancer lump.

Tracy Bevan - who was Ms McGrath's best friend - said the late wife of former cricketer Glenn McGrath came to her hotel room one night, saying she had a found a lump in her breast.

Ms Bevan and Ms McGrath were in England while their husbands were playing in the Ashes series.

'Jane knocked on my door and she had a towel wrapped around her and said Glenn asked to get your opinion on this lump. Does it look a funny shape to you?' Ms Bevan told 9 Stories.

'Then she took my hand and placed it over her breast and I felt it straight away."

The lump was a cause for alarm because at the age of 31, the mother-of-two underwent a mastectomy and an aggressive round of chemotherapy.

But even with this treatment, the cancer made a return in 2003.

The McGrath Foundation in 2002 after Ms McGrath found the support of breast nurses a real help to her during her illness

Ms McGrath had to go through treatment again but this time she had the help of her 'guardian angel' - a breast cancer care nurse.

Ms Bevan said Ms McGrath did not want to burden her husband or her friend with her concerns about cancer.

Instead she offloaded her fears, concerns and fears on the nurse.

'Jane said to me: "I can't tell you the difference it has made to my life and I want this for every Australian family going through breast cancer",' Ms Bevan said.

To give other people who had breast cancer the same relief she had experienced, Ms McGrath established the McGrath Foundation in 2002 with her husband.

It aimed to bring the comfort and support of a breast care nurse to those who battled the disease, regardless of where they were located or their socio-economic background.

Ms Bevan said Ms McGrath sympathised with breast cancer patients in regional areas who had to leave their homes and families to get the treatment they needed away from their support networks.

Despite the cancer making its way to her bones and then her brain, Ms McGrath pushed on with campaigning for more funds from supporters and levels of government.

Leading up to her death, Ms Bevan and Ms McGrath said they looked back on their times as cricketers' wives and what they had achieved through the foundation.

Ms Bevan is an ambassador and director of the McGrath Foundation.

'She was extremely proud. She never spoke about dying. She would just say: "Promise me that we will always be at the McGrath Foundation together and keep making a difference",' she said.

Ms McGrath died in 2008 when funding could send out six breast care nurses.

But now the foundation provides help and support to more than 25,000 families with 100 nurses.

Ms Bevan said her friend would have been 'extremely proud' of their achievements.

'I miss her every single day. But I feel privileged to be able to continue what we started doing in the very beginning,' she said.
