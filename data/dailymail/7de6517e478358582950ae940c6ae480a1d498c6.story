Rights: Alleged war criminal Milan Sarcevic outside his home in south London

He’s accused of being involved in the deaths of hundreds of wounded men and women in the Balkan War.

But Milan Sarcevic has been allowed to stay in Britain because throwing him out would violate his human rights.

Suspected war criminal Sarcevic was told by the Home Office that he must leave last year.

But a judge overturned the decision, and ruled his right to a ‘family life’ under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act means he can stay in Britain.

Sarcevic, a Serbian, is accused of taking part in the 1991 Vukovar massacre, one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war, when up to 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave.

The 60-year-old first came to Britain more than a decade ago and, when refused asylum, returned to Croatia in September 2002.

But just eight months later he was allowed back into Britain to put in another asylum claim.

At the time the system was in chaos, and his case was neglected for nearly eight years, during which time he and his family settled in the UK.

When the Daily Mail tracked him down to the council flat where he lives with his wife and their daughter and granddaughter, he praised human rights laws for allowing his family to remain here.

He had just spent the day volunteering at a polling station during the local government elections.

The smiling former soldier said: ‘I truly have no blood on my hands.

'I was a conscripted soldier for many years but I never killed or targeted innocent civilians.

‘I am just happy that the Human Rights Act has allowed me to stay in this country.

'It is a good thing that the Act has allowed me to stay. It has changed my life.

'Now all I am waiting for is the Home Office to give me clearance so I can find some work.'

‘I know something of being able to do 
accounts ... but I will do any work. Perhaps I will apply to be a 
traffic warden, or a porter or a hotel cleaner. I want to make this 
country my home now.

Sarcevic lives with his 56-year-old 
wife Nada in a Corporation of London flat on a small council estate off 
Old Kent Road in South-East London.

The
flat is also home to his 28-year-old daughter Srdjana and her 
nine-year-old daughter. It is understood that he and his family have 
lived on benefits since arriving here nine years ago because he has not 
been allowed to work.

Sarcevic’s 35-year-old son Alexander – and his partner – have also been granted leave to stay in the country but do not live with him.

When he was first questioned by immigration officials he admitted being a fighter with a Serb military unit in Croatia during the country’s war for independence.

Serbian forces – under the command of Slobodan Milošević – took the city of Vukovar in November 1991 from Croatian defenders.

Around 300 wounded Croats were taken from a hospital to a pig farm at Ovčara and summarily executed.

Sarcevic
told officials he expected to be named as a suspect ‘because I was 
there at the place where they brought the people who lost their lives’.

And
he told officials he expected to be included on a list of war criminals
linked to the massacre, despite protesting that he had tried to rescue 
the victims and as a result narrowly avoided being killed by senior 
officers.

The Home Office refused his application in February last year and accused him of taking a ‘direct role in massacre of the Croatian prisoners’.

Before an immigration appeal judge he ditched his earlier story and claimed he did not know about the massacre until ten years later and that he ‘didn’t fire his gun’ during the battle for Vukovar.

The judge ruled evidence of his involvement was ‘not conclusive’ and did not warrant breaching his family rights under Article 8, saying there was evidence of his ‘strong family life’.

The judge added: ‘At best, there is a possibility that the appellant may have participated but that is not enough  to . . . permit the serious interference that would result in the appellant being removed to his family life and that of those around him.’

Sarcevic’s wife has also been given the right to stay in Britain, because she has depression and is seen as a ‘suicide risk’ if returned to Croatia.

Tory MP Andrew Percy said: ‘It’s totally wrong that this man has had the opportunity to have two goes at the asylum system.

'It’s inexplicable. It’s nonsense to use this Article 8 right to family life. He can easily go back to Serbia and enjoy a family life there.’

Sarcevic is only the latest alleged  war criminal to be given sanctuary in Britain.

Last year, a former henchman of Robert Mugabe was given refuge in the UK. Phillip Machemedze tortured opponents of the regime. He was given the right to stay here in case he faces ill treatment if returned to Zimbabwe.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘Too often weak Article 8 claims have been used to dodge deportation and by this summer the Government will have in place new immigration rules which will help end this abuse.

‘Toughening the rules will make it clear where the public interest in removal should outweigh the migrants’ right to family life, helping us to remove the people who should be removed.’
