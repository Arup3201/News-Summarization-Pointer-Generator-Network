Angel di Maria is set to make his Manchester United debut at Turf Moor on Saturday as Louis van Gaal's side take on Burnley in the Premier League.

The £60million signing from Real Madrid has joined a team who has struggled to adapt to Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation and who are yet to win a game this season.

Di Maria will be expected to hit the ground running and lift spirits around Old Trafford with a stunning debut.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at a selection of previous United big-money debutants and how they fared.

Debut: Angel di Maria will make his Manchester United bow against Burnley on Saturday after his £60m move

Andy Cole £7m (1995)

Andy Cole’s transfer fee from Newcastle broke the British record.

And he lived up to this sum with the only goal in a debut win against Aston Villa, showing the fans that he could become an Old Trafford hero.

He scored 121 in total before leaving in 2001.

Arrival: Andy Cole announced himself to the Old Trafford faithful perfectly with the winner against Aston Villa

Clinical: Cole went on to score 121 goals in all for Manchester United before leaving the club in the 2001 season

Juan Sebastian Veron £28.1m and Ruud van Nistelrooy £19m (2001)

Big-money summer signing Veron’s debut was overshadowed by Van Nistelrooy.

United were 2-1 down at home to Fulham, but the Dutch striker’s brace secured a 3-2 win.

Brace: Dutchman Van Nistelrooy scored twice as United ran out 3-2 winners against Fulham in 2001

Quiet: Veron (left) did not make as much of an impact as Van Nistelrooy did during United's win over Fulham

Wayne Rooney £27m (2004)

Debuts don’t get much better than this.

United beat Fenerbahce 6-2 in the Champions League, and hat-trick hero Rooney was the star man after his move from Everton.

The 18-year-old scored with a tap-in, a 20-yard strike and a free-kick.

Glory, glory: Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick on his United debut in Champions League against Fenerbahce

Whip: Rooney's hat-trick goal was a fantastic free-kick that ensured United won 3-0 against Fenerbahce

Power: Rooney showed a glimpse of what United fans could expect in the following years during his debut

Dimitar Berbatov £30.75m (2008)

The Bulgarian had an instant impact away at fierce rivals Liverpool, pulling the ball back for Carlos Tevez to score after just three minutes.

But Berbatov was fairly quiet in the rest of the game, as Liverpool came back to win 2-1.

Mercurial: Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov signed for Manchester United from Tottenham in 2008 for £30.75m

Impact: Berbatov had a quiet debut against Liverpool except this lovely flick back to Carlos Tevez to score

Robin van Persie £24m (2012)

The signing from Arsenal had a debut to forget as his new side lost 1-0 to a spirited Everton team.

Ferguson decided to start with Rooney and Welbeck up front, so when Van Persie came on after 68 minutes he did not have much time to influence the game.

Day to forget: Robin van Persie (No 20) came off the bench against Everton but United lost 1-0 at Goodison Park

Disappointing: Van Persie did not score or make much of an impact off the bench as United lost to the Toffees

Marouane Fellaini £27.5m (2013)

Fellaini was cheered on to the Old Trafford pitch by fans who were relieved that David Moyes had finally spent some money.

But it was a poor debut for Fellaini despite a 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace.

He looked clumsy and out of his depth.

Warm welcome: Fellaini (right) received rapturous applause from fans relieved David Moyes had spent money

Juan Mata £37.1m (2014)

The new No 8 got off to a winning start at Old Trafford with a 2-0 victory against Cardiff.

Mata showed glimpses of the class he could offer this side, and after only six minutes he had played a part in a Robin van Persie goal.

A steady start for the Spaniard.

Winning start: Juan Mata made his Manchester United debut in a 2-0 victory over Cardiff City in 2014

Neat: Mata provided a nice pass in the build-up to Robin van Persie's opening goal after only six minutes
