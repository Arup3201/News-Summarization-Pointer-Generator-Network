After receiving a call from a gay man who said he suffered homophobic abuse on a train in Luton, two radio presenters decided to conduct an experiment.

BBC Three Counties DJs Iain Lee and Justin Dealey walked through the town to gauge the public reaction to an openly gay couple.

A 23-year-old called Nick had told them he was used to being insulted by strangers when he and his boyfriend held hands.

And after the two presenters walked the streets of Luton doing so, they were shocked to be told: 'It's disgusting'.  

In the video, the men walk down a street and as they pass a group of men, each one turns to stare at the supposedly gay couple.

Mr Dealey says: 'We've walked about three or four minutes and we've had looks, we've definitely had looks.'

And Mr Lee says: 'I saw a dad usher a child away from us, did you see that? 

'Yeah, there was a dad walking with his kid, he clocked the hands, clocked us, and then said, 'Come on, love. Come on.'

Mr Dealey says: 'We've walked about three or four minutes and we've had looks, we've definitely had looks'

But then they approach a teenager after overhearing him say 'urgh' after noticing their entwined hands.

They approach the boy and ask him to elaborate on his comment and are told: 'I thought it was disgusting.' 

Asked why, he repeats: 'Because it's disgusting.' 

A woman, who was with him at the time, says: 'He doesn't obviously agree with homosexuality. He's got a stigma. He's a teenage boy.'

And when asked for her own views, she says: 'I'm not against it, but I don't like it in my face to be honest. 

'It does make me feel a little bit embarrassed if you two were to embrace in a kiss, I would feel a little bit awkward but that's about as far as it would go.'

She adds she is not 'narrow-minded' but says: 'Especially in Luton you don't see that. You wouldn't see that.'

And the boy then repeats: 'I just think it's wrong for two men, I think it's disgusting in my opinion.' 

At the end of the experiment, Mr Lee concludes: 'It certainly felt uncomfortable. Whereas I know if you'd been a girl and I was holding your hand, there would have been nothing.

He adds: 'I'm surprised and disappointed.'
