While some physicists may be working on string theory or quantum mechanics, Manuel Linares has decided to turn his attention to something else entirely – ice cream.

The Spanish physicist and now professional cook has announced that he has invented a ‘magical’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it.

Dubbed ‘Xamaleón’, the ice creams tastes like a mix of fruits and was created during a cooking course attended by Mr Linares in Barcelona.

While some physicists may be working on string theory or quantum mechanics, Manuel Linares has decided to turn his attention to something else entirely – ice cream. The Spanish physicist and now professional cook has just announced that he has been able to invent a ‘magical’ ice cream that changes colour as you lick it

Everyone laughed at his idea, but as a physicist he knew that there are various possibilities that might work, the 37-year-old told Cocinatis.

Before it’s served, the treat is a light blue colour, but this quickly changes when the server adds a spray of ‘love elixir, as Mr Linares calls it.

The spray transforms the ice cream into a dark pink shade in around 10 to 15 seconds.

When the customer licks the ice cream, it again changes into other pink shades as it melts

The formula, which remains a secret, is made entirely from natural ingredients, according to Mr Linares.

The Spaniard said he gained his inspiration from the British ice cream genius Charlie Francis, the creator of a fluorescent ice.

The chef is currently offering his ice cream at his shop in in the town of Calella de Mar, in the east Spanish province of Barcelona.

He is also working on another two ice creams. One will react to ultraviolet lights in clubs, while another will turn from white to pink as it’s eaten.

Mr Linares is now hoping to find buyers to sell the ice cream abroad.

The science of ice cream just got serious. No longer content with simple taste tests, scientists now want to visualise exactly how the treat melts in the mouth.

And one group of researchers in Spain has been able to do just that using software that reveals what makes the summer treat so addictive.

Using a technique known as Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS), researchers have analysed how much 'coldness', 'creaminess' and 'roughness' is need to make the perfect frozen dessert.

The software is able to generate coloured curves that follow changes in a variety of attributes, which also include 'gumminess' and how much the ice cream coats the taster's mouth.

‘As well as how it looks before being served, the texture on our tongue and palate is key to it being accepted and considered as a quality product,’ said researcher Susana Fiszman.

 been able to analyse the fleeting experience of eating. These graphs 
shows taste curves for two types of ice cream, the left containing only 
sweetened milk (M) and the right containing milk, cream, egg and the 
chemical hydrocolloids (MCEH)
