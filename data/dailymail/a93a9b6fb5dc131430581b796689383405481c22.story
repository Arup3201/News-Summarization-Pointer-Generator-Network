An A&E department plagued by abusive patients is to open the first hospital police station in the UK, to tackle the rising tide of violence.

Staff at the Royal Blackburn Hospital's emergency department were forced to call police 1,230 times from September 2012 to September 2013 - an average of 100 calls a month.

The majority of those calls were for help dealing with patients who were being physically and verbally abusive, while drunk or high on drugs.

Pioneering: Two police liaison officers will be stationed in A&E at The Royal Blackburn Hospital from Tuesday. The £80,000 pilot project - thought to be the first of its kind in the UK - aims to reduce the pressure on police and staff in the emergency unit. Picture posed by models

Officers were called to deal with assaults on members of staff, concerns over the safety of other patients, and often to help find distressed patients who had disappeared from the department.

But from Tuesday two specially trained liaison officers will be stationed in the hospital's busy A&E unit to help stem the rising problem.

The £80,000 pilot project aims to deal with those patients who regularly turn up at the department.

Chief Inspector Justin Srivastava, of Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'This project isn’t about providing a security presence in A&E.

'These two officers will be highly skilled individuals trained to 
identify complex frequent attenders at A&E who can benefit from 
other services.

'This 
is an extremely positive initiative across the health economy aimed at 
dealing with the root cause of the problem rather than treating the 
symptoms of the problem and thus allow resources to be utilised better 
both from a hospital and police perspective.'

While other hospitals in the UK have officers on site at weekends, this is thought to be the first full-time project of its kind.

Charles
 Thomson, Clinical Director of the Emergency Department at East 
Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'This initiative represents an 
ideal opportunity to benefit the patients in ensuring that they get 
directed to appropriate services.

Rising tide of violence: In the year from September 2012 to September 2013 A&E staff at the hospital in Lancashire had to call police 1,230 times for help to deal with patients who were being physically and verbally abusive, and those who were drunk and high on drugs

'It also gives our staff increased 
support on site and increases police efficiency.

'This example of safe, 
personal and effective care will result in a better experience for all 
patients who attend our Emergency Department.

'It will help to reduce 
emergency admissions, re-admissions and streamline the way care is 
provided to ensure safe and dignified care – key requirements from the 
Keogh review.'

Dr Chris Clayton, the Clinical Chief Officer at the NHS Blackburn and Darwen CCG, said the initiative should improve the quality of care those distressed patients receive.

He said it is designed to reduce the demand on both the police force as well as under-pressure hospital teams.

Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw, added: 'I am 
committed to ensuring the Constabulary's work is focused around early 
action, and this scheme will hopefully ensure residents receive the help
 and support they require at the earliest possible opportunity.'

The officers have been trained to work with doctors and nurses to spot those individuals who display challenging behaviour, alcohol and substance misuse issues, people with undiagnosed mental health issues and those who frequently visit the hospital with any of the problems.
