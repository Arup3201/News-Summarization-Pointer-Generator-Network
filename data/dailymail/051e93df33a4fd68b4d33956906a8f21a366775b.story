Mick Philpott’s ‘shameless’ lifestyle was fuelled by a welfare system which encouraged him to have children for the benefit money they generated, Ann Widdecombe said yesterday.

The former Government minister, who spent a week living with the Philpott family for a television documentary, said the father of 17 treated his offspring as ‘meal tickets’.

The former Tory Home Office Minister spoke amid a debate over the welfare system’s role in fostering families such as the Philpotts, as sweeping Government reforms aimed at halting a ‘culture of dependency’ come into force this week.

She was backed by councillors in Philpott’s home city of Derby and a local MP, Nigel Mills, in blaming the benefit system for encouraging Philpott’s dysfunctional family set-up. 

But the Philpotts’ MP, Labour’s Margaret Beckett, said the family were not reflective of benefit claimants in general.

Philpott raked in tens of thousands of pounds a year in child benefit, working family tax credits and the wages of his wife and mistress, Lisa Willis, 29, who both worked as cleaners.

In the 2007 documentary Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefit Culture, the then MP found Philpott three jobs but he failed to keep any of them.

She said yesterday the ‘prime purpose’ of Philpott’s children was to ‘serve his convenience and provide his benefits’.

She branded Philpott’s attempts to portray himself as a devoted father and house husband a pathetic con.

She said: ‘I’m appalled by what happened to the children and that now wipes out everything else, but before this happened I was appalled by a state system that allowed a man to live in this way so blatantly.

'He tried to portray himself as a house husband, but that was nonsense, he didn’t do anything.’ 

Conservative councillor Mick Barker, who represents the Oakwood ward at Derby City Council, said: ‘You might think the Philpotts were dysfunctional, but believe me, they were not exceptional and not unique.

‘Everyone in the police knew of Mick and the fact he was using his children to live a life of luxury on welfare, but he was one of dozens of people the authorities dealt with every day who did the same thing.’ 

Childline founder Esther Rantzen joined neighbours and former friends of the Philpotts in criticising social services for failing to intervene in the family over the decade Philpott lived with his wife, lover and the children.

She said Philpott’s history of domestic abuse and the ‘pernicious’ impact violence, fights and arguments would have had on the children should have been enough for them to have stepped in.

Derby City Council has refused to comment on the extent of its involvement with the family ahead of a serious case review, but has admitted the children were ‘not subject to child protection plans or legal orders’.
