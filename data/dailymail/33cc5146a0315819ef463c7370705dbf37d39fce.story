They are the team who helped David Karp turn Tumblr into Yahoo's billion dollar baby.

And while the 26-year-old founder will receive an estimated $253 million in cash as well as a small amount of Yahoo stock from the deal, his loyal colleagues certainly won't go away empty-handed.

Most of the core team have been with David since the early days of Tumblr and the first 30 employees stand to make an average of $3.6 million each, according to PrivCo, a New York-based research firm that tracks private companies and the venture capital industry.

Thanks to their stock options, Tumblr's 178 employees will divvy up $66 million, according to Time.

While after taxes, David will reportedly be worth about $190 million.

They're rich! The people who made Tumblr: From left: Andrew Terng, Jacob Bijani, Christopher Price, photographer Terry Richardson, Peter Vidani, Matt Hackett, John Maloney, Marco Arment, David Karp and Jared Hecht at the Tumblr office in 2010.

Proud: Tumblr founder David Karp hugs his mother Barbara Ackerman at the Webbys in New York on Tuesday - just hours after selling his company to Yahoo! for $1.1 billion.

David, a high-school drop-out, initially wanted to keep his company to a minimum, according to Tumblr's first lead developer Marco Arment, but as the firm expanded, they were forced to hire more staff.

While some of the initial Tumblr team are not with the company any more - they will still benefit from the Yahoo deal and their joy is clear to see.

This week, Marco blogged: 'I won't make yacht-and-helicopter money from the acquisition. But as long as I manage investments properly and don't spend recklessly, Tumblr has given my family a strong safety net and given me the freedom to work on whatever I want. And that's exactly what I plan to do.'

John Maloney, Tumblr's former President, tweeted: 'Emotional day, I first met @davidkarp when he was 15 and we spent 8 years together across two startups, we put our hearts/souls into Tumblr,' before adding: 'Just bought some Yahoo stock.'

Mr Maloney first met David Karp while working for Urban Baby, of which he is a co-founder, and joined Tumblr in 2008 to help turn the site into a real business.

Upon his departure in April 2012, David wrote: 'As a mentor he taught me, among many things, how to convincingly act like an adult.' Mr Maloney was never replaced after he left, although Tumblr has been looking for a new President.

David admitted Mr Maloney was in charge of bills, investors, offices, hiring, lawyers 'and the thousands of emails that were sitting in my inbox...John magically put everything in order...John was the catalyst for everything Tumblr has accomplished.'

Marc LaFountain was Tumblr's community director and third employee and now lives in Switzerland, where he is the CEO of Elixr, an app which helps you find the best watering holes in cities around the world.

He was praised by Mr Maloney for having 'incredible commitment', and building customer support from zero, as well as being a 'lovely person and talent,' and replied on Twitter: 'Thanks so much, John. I learned a ton from working with you. It was an amazing experience!'

Mr Maloney, who is also an angel investor and a co-chair of the Tech4Obama ‘12 Committee. also paid tribute to Jacob Bijani, Tumblr's product engineer and employee number five, calling him a 'massive talent yet such humility, positivity, whatever needed to be done, Jacob deserves some glow here.'

We're in the money: Tumblr's first lead developer Marco Arment, left, and former President John Maloney.

There at the beginning: Peter Vidani, left, is Tumblr's creative director and was the sixth employee - while Marc LaFountain was employee No.3 and is the company's former community director.

Peter Vidani is Tumblr's creative director and helped to create the paired-down look of the site.

He is Tumblr's sixth employee and joined after the bosses took notice of the themes he designed for Tumblr blogs and in an interview with The Industry he told things had not changed that much, adding: 'The product itself hasn't changed much for the past four years...The challenge that we face now is to accommodate our enormous growth in users and new technology while still keeping the product really small.'

Meaghan O'Connell, director of outreach, and one of the most senior women at Tumblr, tweeted that she was 'still grateful my mom lent me $20 so i could buy a metrocard to get to this job interview with @JohnMaloney', as she posted the email she was sent first inviting her to a job interview.

Ahead of the deal announcement, she write: 'Is someone going to call me or something if tumblr gets acquired? Or do I need to set up some kind of google alert,' before joking to a friend: 'I will dab your tears with hundred dollar bills.'

Matt Hackett, Senior Developer, posted a

Terry Richardson in 2010 and blogged: 'Congratulations to the truly 
incredible set of people who made Tumblr what it is today. I couldn’t be
prouder to have spent time among your ranks.'And to those 
worried about the future: If there is one thing years of having worked 
with David and the whole team have taught me, it’s that the community is
sacred. You won’t be let down. Go, Tumblr, go!'

I'm rich! Tumblr founder David Karp poses with Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer following Yahoo!'s acquisition of Tumblr in Times Square on May 20, 2013 in New York City.The internet giant Yahoo! purchased the blogging site Tumblr for $1.1 billion.

Jared Hecht, Tumblr's former business development manager, tweeted before the deal: 'If Yahoo & Tumblr rumors are true then FB (facebook) should swoop in and eat their lunch. Much more strategic for them.

'It's a young demographic that doesn't use FB anymore. Owning Instagram and Tumblr will lock in lost eyeballs for a long time.'

Others set to profit are Christopher 
Price, known as Topher Chris, Tumblr's editorial director, Andrew Terng,
the company's director of sysops, Thomas Duffy, Tumblr's community 
manager and Mark Coatney, the firm's media evangelist, who retweeted the
message: 'Don’t forget to send congrats to all the unsung heroes of the
Tumblr story including @JohnMaloney @kathbarna and @fredseibert.'

Katherine Barna is head of 
commuications at Tumblr, while media entrepreneur Fred Seibert is the 
person who nurtured David Karp as a teenager and saw his potential.

Billion-dollar pals: Bijan Sabet of Spark Capital hugging David Karp following the Tumblr-Yahoo acquisition. Bijan was one of the first investors in Tumblr.

Smiling: Mark Coatney, left, Tumblr's media evangelist, and Matt Hackett, Senior Developer, who paid tribute to the 'incomparable' Tumblr team after the Yahoo! acquisition.

When Yahoo announced on Monday it had
acquired Tumblr, for a reported $1.1 billion. Spark and USV, which 
eventually invested $13 million each into the company, garnered $192 
million each in proceeds.

For now, David Karp jokes that at least he now has enough money to go to college - but is more than content to stay in his $1.6 million, one-bedroom loft in trendy Williamsburg, Brookyn, where he lives with his girlfriend Rachel Eakley, who is a trained chef and a graduate student in psychology, and their dog Clark.

Prior to the deal, the Tumblr CEO held about a 25 per cent stake in the New York City-based blogging platform he created.

Minimalist: David Karp bought his Brooklyn loft for $1.6 million in January 2012.

Sprawling: David Karp's home is 1,700 square feet. He paid $25,000 more than the asking price.

Forbes reported that with Yahoo’s acquisition of Tumblr, nearly a third of David's windfall will go to federal and New York state coffers following the close of his company’s deal with Yahoo.

As a New York City resident, David will face taxes of almost 33 per cent since his payday – cash and stock included– will be treated as capital gains.

If Yahoo’s acquisition of Tumblr is officially completed in the next few months as expected, David will likely pay just under $90 million in taxes by April 15, 2014 to the federal government and New York state government combined. After taxes, David will reportedly be worth about $190 million.

Making his first appearance since the Yahoo deal at the Webbys in New York on Tuesday night with his proud mother Barbara Ackerman, David insisted to Page Six: 'I don’t even know how much money it is. I swear, I haven’t given it a moment of thought.'

The tech phenomenon said he has had some unexpected calls of congratulations. “My math tutor was one of the first people to call me,”

And for the others, well, they're basking in Tumblr's glory - and planning a drink or 10.
