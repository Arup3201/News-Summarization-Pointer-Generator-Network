A British singer has achieved celebrity status in China with his renditions of Communist revolutionary songs.

Expat Iain Inglis delighted a TV audience of millions with his appearance on China's Got Talent, dressed in a Red Army uniform.

The Welsh university lecturer reached the semi-final of the competition - and believes the only reason he did not get further was because he was censored by the ruling Communist Party.

Celebrity: Iain Inglis has found fame in China after appearing on television singing revolutionary songs

Unusual: The 30-year-old Welshman says that Chinese audiences find his singing 'quite amusing'

But the 30-year-old has used his newfound performing experience to carve out a career as a singer, charging up to £5,000 for each appearance.

'I'm a tall, white foreigner from Wales singing songs about Communism in Chinese,' Mr Inglis said.

'It was a bit of fun to start off with but the more performances I did, the more I was hooked.

'For some reason the Chinese people seem to find it quite hilarious.'

He received a rapturous response when he
appeared in the third series of China's Got Talent, dressed in a 
revolutionary outfit and singing 'I Love Reading Chairman Mao's Books 
Most'.

Education: Mr Inglis taught himself Communist music after moving to China to be with his wife

Talented: But the singer was apparently barred from the final of China's Got Talent

Mr Inglis advanced to the last 16 in the Chinese edition of Simon Cowell's TV hit, but says he was banned from proceeding to the final round.

'As far as I knew I was through to the final round,' he said.

'But the day before I was due to perform I got a phonecall saying the Bureau of Broadcasting said I wasn't able to go on.

'There was no real reason given - perhaps they weren't very keen on having a foreigner singing songs about Communism.

'I was very disappointed, but that's just how it is.'

Career: Mr Inglis is paid up to £5,000 for performing his music in a Red Army uniform

Bizarre: The tunes Mr Inglis sings include 'I Love Reading Chairman Mao's Books Most'

However, the enterprising expat - who speaks Chinese, Russian and German - did not let the disappointment set back his new career, and is now available for hire at concerts and private parties.

Mr Inglis has lived in China for eight years, ever since meeting his wife Yu Yanling on a plane.

He taught himself to sing 'red' songs with a CD of Communist hit 'Socialism Is Great'.

The couple live in the city of Sanya on Hainan Island.
