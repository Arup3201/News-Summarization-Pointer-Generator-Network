It is a chillingly unique insight into the horrors of war, filmed by one man on his moped through the ravaged remains of Syria's bomb-battered Homs.

The daring filmmaker zips through the city's empty streets capturing the devastation that now covers every inch of this once bustling city.

It is now a ghost-town.

All that can be heard above the spluttering engine of the videographer's scooter is the constant rattle of machine gun fire that echoes throughout his 10-minute footage.

Destruction: The film has emerged days after the United Nations said it may withdraw from its monitoring mission in Syria after a joint US-Russian call for an immediate end to the conflict

Eerie: All that can be heard above the spluttering engine of the videographer's scooter is the constant rattle of machine gun fire that echoes throughout his 10-minute footage

At one point he stops to help a group of young men transfer a wounded comrade from the back of a car into a truck.

The only people we see are young men. Everybody else has either fled or are hiding.

Rows of burned-out cars, rubble strewn across almost every street, a dining set in what remains of a third-floor apartment and bed sheets left to dry on a washing line riddled with bullet holes are what is left behind.

The unverified video was posted last Friday by the anti-Assad Beirut-based news site Sawtberuit.com.

The film has emerged days after the United Nations said it may 
withdraw from its monitoring mission in Syria after a joint US-Russian
call for an immediate end to the conflict.

Mission
leader Major General Robert Mood, whose 300 unarmed monitors suspended 
operations on Saturday because of escalating bloodshed, will brief the 
Security Council later.

With
civilians trapped by regime shelling of rebel bastions such as the 
central city of Homs, Mood has urged the government and opposition to 
let 'women, children, the elderly and the injured to leave conflict 
zones'.
