All that glitters is not gold as a new prank video demonstrates.

YouTube user Edamame said he was so sick of his father opening his mail that he decided to give him a sparkling surprise.

He sent himself a spring-loaded tube of glitter and secretly filmed his nosy father popping it open.

As the 'glitter bomb' releases hundreds of shimmering pieces, the father is heard angrily cursing.

The purple glitter coats his desk and computer keyboard.

The man continues to swear as he finds glitter all over his clothing. He then walks off in a huff.

His son apparently ordered the glitter bomb from the website ruindays.com.

The company states: '[We] believe that anyone that has ever wronged you should pay.'
