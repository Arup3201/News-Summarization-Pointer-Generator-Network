A Cleveland cheerleader has made a swift recovery from spinal surgery after an inspirational fight to get back to practice.

High school senior Courteney Belmonte, from Westlake, Ohio was diagnosed with scoliosis in sixth grade and was told her best option was surgery.

She was given a year to make a full recovery, but Miss Belmonte managed to get an all-clear after just six months of rehabilitation.

Three cheers: High school cheerleader Courteney Belmonte was so determined to return to her squad that she made a full recovery from spinal surgery in just six months

Miss Belmonte was devastated when she found out her spine problem required surgery, fearing that she would never be able to cheerlead again.

After undergoing orthopaedic surgery which saw her curved spine fused together using bone grafts and metallic implants, she was told it would take about a year until she could make her comeback on the field.

However, Miss Belmonte, a varsity cheerleader at Westlake High School, resolved to do it quicker, and six months after the surgery she was back in the gym.

'I just think never give up on something 
you really want,’ Miss Belmonte told Cleveland.com. ‘[Getting the all 
clear] was probably one of the greatest feelings in the world.’

Spinal issue: Scoliosis (this is not an image of Courteney's condition) means that the spine is curved instead of straight

‘Courteney is an exceptional young lady,’ paediatric orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Ryan Goodwin at the Cleveland Clinic told Cleveland.com

‘Rather than give up and accept that she may never tumble again, she worked exceptionally hard during her recovery and returned to her activity at an even higher level.

'Her spirit is truly inspiring.’

Miss Belmonte’s determination to return to her cheerleading squad has earned her the  Cleveland Clinic Sports Health Courage Award.

Set to attend Ohio University this autumn, her goal is to become a physical therapist, with a focus on paediatric sports medicine.

Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine which can be present at birth or occur later in life.

The spine of a person suffering from scoliosis resembles the letter 'S' or even a questionmark.

It
 can be managed with physiotherapy and bracing, more common in children 
as the body is still growing, however with more severe cases, fusing 
surgery is often performed.

In
 the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000, 
but it is thought that around 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree 
of scoliosis.
