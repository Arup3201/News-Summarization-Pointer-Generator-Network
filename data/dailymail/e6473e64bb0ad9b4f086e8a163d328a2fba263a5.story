Police were today hunting a mystery knifeman who has been threatening innocent people while wearing a Scream mask.

The attacker, donning the distinctive mask from the 1996 U.S. slasher film, has been spotted several times in the town of Yeovil in Somerset.

They have repeatedly terrorised members of the public - and even brandished a knife on one occasion.

Police have warned locals not to approach the masked suspect, but to call 999 immediately.

PCSO Jessica Forsey said: 'We are aware that there have been incidents recently involving somebody wearing a mask from the Scream film trying to scare people.

'We can confirm that we have had a report from a member of the public in which it was stated that the person may have been carrying a knife. We are still looking into the incident.

'We believe that this is just somebody playing pranks on people.

'However, the person responsible should be aware that they could be committing criminal offences and should stop immediately.'

Officers are believed to have been close to catching the suspect on one occasion, but he managed to escape.

Locals have been taking to social media to warn others about the attacker, who some have seen 'standing outside houses' in the mask.

Amy Parr said on Facebook: 'There is somebody going round Yeovil with a scream mask on and just standing outside people’s houses. If you see them, don’t let them see you then call the police.

'They can’t do much but they do scare them off. If you go and run at them, they will come back.'

Scream masks, worn by killers in the hit film and subsequent sequels, are white and usually worn with a black hood and cloak.

In the first film, they were used as a disguise used by teenagers Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard) during their killing 
spree in the fictional town of Woodsboro.

The movie, also starring Courteney Cox, David Arquette and Neve Campbell, broke box office records when it was released
