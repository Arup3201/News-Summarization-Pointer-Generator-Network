Only 15 months apart, the two have always been very close growing up.

'We are definitely best friends! We have been super close our entire lives and working together only seemed natural considering we spend most of our days together', Felicia said.

The two entrepreneurs from Sydney's eastern suburbs began their journey to success when Felicia gave birth to her daughter four years ago.

'I decided to get back into shape by training with my husband lifting weights, he is a personal trainer,' Felicia told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Diana was working at the child care where I was taking my daughter and all the mums kept asking what I did to get back into shape.

'Diana had done a personal training course, so all these mums came to us and asked if we could train them', Felicia said. 

This attention prompted the driven  beauties to set up an outdoor fitness group for mothers called Super Mums in Training.

Using lots of equipment, Diana and Felicia trained mums at a local park, helping them to stay motivated to achieve a healthy lifestyle.

It was not long after that other women who were not mums began to notice the two strong and beautiful sisters. They were both approached by younger girls who wanted to get in shape.

'So that is when we expanded and went to online training.

'We wanted something that would cater for all women - not just mums. We didn't want to stick to just one type of woman,' Felicia said.

And so, Base Body Babes was born.

They both swear by weight training, but also believe switching up your workouts get the best results

The two Sydney-siders said their mission is to help women create their ultimate base bodies.  

'For us our whole philosophy isn’t last minute quick fixes or crash diets - we never take extreme measures,' Felicia said. 

'It’s a process, it takes time and it starts by eating a balanced diet and then eventually the results will come.  

Clearly two women who know how to build a base body, Felicia and Diana said the secret to their strong and healthy bodies are eating a balanced diet and training four to six times a week.

'We recommend our girls to weight train at least three times a week and it is important to try and do something different - change programs every 3 to 4 weeks.

'Progression is really important. There is no point doing the same thing over and over everyday,' Felicia said. 

Their training method is a combination of strength and circuit style resistance training that has proven to get guaranteed results. 

Together, the two super fit babes strive to help women everywhere with their base bodies. And, who wouldn't trust their expertise - just look at their rock hard abs.

'We are all about doing it the right way, the healthy way', Felicia said. 'We want to educated women to eat well and train well.' 

But besides teaching women how to eat right and train hard,  the two sisters said they are always busy working on expanding their brand and managing their clients.

Felicia looks after their social media accounts, uploading workout videos, posting healthy meals for inspiration, sharing fashionable sportswear, and managing content. Diana gets up early in the morning and is out training  clients all day.
