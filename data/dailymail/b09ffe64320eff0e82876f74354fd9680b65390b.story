Amy Pascal, the Sony Pictures honcho who was the victim of a hack attack, is in hot water all over again

Sony boss Amy Pascal is facing another race row over details made public from her email account.

RadarOnline reports that buried in her email sent folder is a message to another Sony executive saying that TV deals were becoming so popular in Hollywood that they were 'the new black baby' that everyone wants. 

The comment appears to be a racially charged jibe at white Hollywood stars like Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron and Sandra Bullock who adopt African or African-American children, according to Radar. 

Pascal's remarks imply that such adoptions were little more than a hot fashion accessory in her eyes.

Pascal has previously been under fire for suggesting that she talk only about a series of slavery-related movies during a brief meeting with President Barack Obama. She later apologized for those comments. 

In the newly-released email, Pascal - the co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment - is communicating with Sony Television President Steve Mosko, who was angry that he wasn't looped in on a new TV rights deal that Sony had struck. 

Pascal replied that the deal mostly had to do with films.

'But like everyone with half a brain these days television is the thing they want to do,' she wrote. 

She then told Mr Mosko that he was 'not used to TV being the new black baby,' according to emails viewed by Radar. 

Calls had already been rising for the influential Sony executive to be fired in the wake of the scandal. 

Now, the pressure will likely increase.

Pascal was forced to apologize after media organizations published the content of emails from an exchange with film producer Scott Rubin. 

'What should I ask the president at this stupid ... breakfast?' asks.

She then offers that the president probably liked 'Django Unchained' - a violent film about a slave freeing himself. Mr Rubin counters with '12 Years a Slave' and then 'Ride-along.'

'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Mr Rubin writes.

In the new emails, Pascal hits close to home for many top stars. 

Sandra Bullock adopted her African-American son Louis from New Orleans in 2010, while still with husband Jesse James. When the two split up, she completed adoption proceedings and currently parents him as a single mother.

Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt adopted daughter Zahara Marley from Ethiopia in 2005 after meeting her in an orphanage when she was just six months old.

Charlize Theron adopted African-American son Jackson in 2012. In 2006, Madonna adopted son David Banda from the African nation of Malawi.

Director Stephen Spielberg and wife Kate Capshaw have two black adopted children. 

'Nashville' star Connie Britton adopted son Eyob 'Yoby' from Ethiopia in 2011. 

'Sex and the City' star Kristin Davis adopted an African-American child in 2011.
