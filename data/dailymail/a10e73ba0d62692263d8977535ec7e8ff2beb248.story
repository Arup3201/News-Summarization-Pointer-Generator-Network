Luton Town striker Elliot Lee celebrated scoring against Wycombe Wanderers on Tuesday night with a touching tribute to his friend, former West Ham United forward Dylan Tombides.

Tombides died in April last year after a battle with testicular cancer and Lee, a friend of the tragic Hammers youngster, showed off a message under his shirt after his seventh-minute equaliser.

The 20-year-old is on loan at Kenilworth Road from West Ham and has also been wearing the No 38 shirt, the same squad number as Tombides had during his time at Upton Park.

Kenilworth Road has also been renamed 'The Prostate Cancer UK Stadium' for the evening in a partnership with the charity that shares the name. it is the first time a Football League club's stadium has been renamed in support of a charity.

Lee later grabbed a second equaliser for Luton but Alfie Mawson crashed in Wanderers' third goal after earlier strikes by Sam Saunders and Paul Hayes, from a penalty.

Tombides died last April after being diagnosed with cancer three years previously.

Tributes to him poured in, with the DT38 Foundation formed to raise awareness and provide support for those suffering with testicular cancer.
