It was the beginning of a dream life together for proud parents Paul and Isabel Mason and their beautiful newborn triplets.

Tragically the dream was to last for little more than a week.

Just eight days after she gave birth, Mrs Mason collapsed and died from a rare and undetected heart condition possibly triggered by her pregnancy.

Isabel Mason, right, had been 'on top of the world' after giving birth to triplets but she died just eight days after their birth. Her husband Paul is pictured left

The sudden loss has understandably left her husband distraught.  

Mr Mason said his wife – whose funeral is today – had been ‘over the moon’ after giving birth to Mattias, Lukas and Sarah and he described his family’s week together as ‘precious’.

‘We were both overjoyed to be having an instant family,’ he said. ‘The triplets were our first and most probably last children.

‘We looked forward to sharing and introducing our children to our shared hobbies of family time around the kitchen table, playing guitar, country walks, camping, motorbiking, listening to the rain and watching the world go by.’

Instead, his 34-year-old wife collapsed and was taken to the Royal Hampshire County Hospital – the same hospital in which she gave birth. She died there on March 10.

Mrs Mason is believed to have possibly died from haemopericardium, where blood leaks into the sac surrounding the heart from a cut in an artery.

A consultant cardiologist said the problem, which often proves fatal, was more likely to happen during pregnancy.

The couple, of Weeke, near Winchester, both worked for Ordnance Survey in Southampton.

Memories: Isabel and Paul Mason on their wedding day in 2010

They met at work and were married in 2010 in a Tudor house. It had been Mrs Mason’s childhood dream.

As they planned a family together, Mrs Mason, an IT project manager originally from Zeulenroda-Triebes in South-East Germany, underwent IVF treatment.

After a pregnancy of 34 weeks and three days, she gave birth naturally to Mattias, 4lb 5oz, Lukas, 3lb 7oz, and Sarah, 3lb 9oz.

Mr Mason, 44, who works in the products department, said: ‘Since Isabel’s death I have been overwhelmed with the messages of support and tributes to her. We would like to thank all of our friends and colleagues who have been in touch as these words of comfort and kindness mean so much.’

The keen motorcyclist added: ‘I have 
been advised by doctors to take things easier. It is surprising how 
quickly one can go from strong to stressed.

‘I have been literally inundated and overwhelmed by everyone’s response, from across the world, to the sad news about Isabel.

‘Everyone
has offered help, including people I hardly know. My brother, his wife 
and my wider family have been an absolute rock.’

Mr
Mason had recorded his joy at the birth of his children on an internet 
forum for new parents in the days after the births. His entries read: 
‘There are so many thoughts going on in my head.

‘Things to do with the house, to look out
for Isabel, to communicate on email and social media, for work, arrange
stuff, order the pram, photos to upload and send to relatives and 
friends, small stuff that we have experienced and other relevant 
minutiae that we should capture before it is lost in the ticker tape of 
life.’

Yesterday, his wife’s profile on Twitter still described her as ‘in love; pregnant with triplets; smiling; philosophical and relaxed whenever possible’.

An inquest into her death has been opened and adjourned.

Cardiologist Dr Dawn Adamson explained that the haemopericardium may have been caused by ‘aortic dissection’, a condition more likely to occur in pregnancy.

She said: ‘Many women may be predisposed but do not know. Pregnancy adds an extra strain, especially multiple pregnancies.’
