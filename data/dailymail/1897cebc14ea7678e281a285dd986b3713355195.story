Tourists from Saudi Arabia are the world’s biggest spenders when they head abroad, splashing more £14bn  every year, according to government figures.

The wealthy Gulf country says at least 4.5 million Saudi tourists take at least one holiday each year and they spend as much as six times as Western holidaymakers, Al-Sharq reported.

The announcement comes after an unrelated global study found that holidaymakers from Saudi Arabia spend an average of nearly £4,500 per getaway - the most in the world.

Saudi Arabians were followed by Australians (£2,700 per trip) and Chinese travellers (£2,540).

With so much money being spent abroad Saudi Arabia is now looking at ways to develop its tourism industry to lure foreign visitors and entice its own residents to opt for a staycation and spend money at home.

Khalid Al-Dughaim, secretary general for the Saudi Commission for Tourism, told Al-Sharq that the kingdom has not realised the full economic potential for tourism as the industry is still relatively new compared to other Gulf and Arabian countries, and does not receive full financial support.

Looking to Dubai as a ‘perfect example’, he said: ‘The tourism industry is looking at tackling the obstacles it has in order to enhance its services.

‘The travel agencies, tourism agencies and the activities we offer nationally must be re-evaluated.

 ‘Development of the tourism industry will enrich regional income and enhance the attraction of the country’s landmarks and history. It will also create job opportunities for many job-seekers.'
