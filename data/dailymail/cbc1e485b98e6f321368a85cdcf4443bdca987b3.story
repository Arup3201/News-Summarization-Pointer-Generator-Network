A father-of-two has been banned from every single pub in Queensland as part of his bail conditions after facing five charges in court.

Steve Parnell allegedly punched an officer in the face after police were called to his house early on Sunday morning.

While facing his charges at Gladstone Magistrates Court, Parnell was told he could not enter any licensed premise - including restaurants or clubs - in the state if he wanted bail.

He has also had to commit to being breath-tested every week, the Gladstone Observer reports.

Magistrate Mark Morrow told him the only establishment he could probably go into now is ‘Hungry Jacks and Maccas’ because they don’t serve booze.

Mr Morrow said: ‘My concern is that every time he drinks he seems to become a problem.’

Police were called to Parnell’s home in Tannum Sands, a coastal town on the central east coast of Queensland, on Sunday after receiving noise complaints.

The court was told at one point officers used a Taser on Parnell.

Parnell will face court again on April 7 when his five charges, including two counts of serious assault will be heard.
