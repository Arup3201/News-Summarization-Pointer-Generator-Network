An 'expert survivalist' mother who went missing more than a week ago has been found safe and sound camping in a park, police say.

Felicia Williamson Lane had not been seen by her husband or 19-year-old daughter since November 26 at their home in Cumming, Georgia.

But the 40-year-old was found unharmed in Vogel State Park in Blairsville, Georgia - 55 miles away from home on Saturday evening, police said.

Mrs Lane left home without telling her family, taking a credit card, ID, her dog and enough food to eat for five days - but leaving her mobile phone.

She is an outdoors expert and was often seen at the Chattahoochee Wildlife and Dawson Forest areas, reported the Gainesville Times.

She was seen on Thursday buying camping supplies at a Walmart in Dahlonega, Georgia, reported the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Police don't suspect foul play. They haven't yet confirmed the whereabouts of the family's Jack Russell terrier, which Mrs Lane took with her.

She drives a burgundy 1998 Jeep Wrangler, which has a picture of a snake and the phrase ‘Don’t tread on me’ on the spare tyre cover.

Police had suspected early on that she had headed for a campsite somewhere in Georgia and had asked hikers to be vigilant.

'Information we have indicates she is an ‘expert’ survivalist. She has hiked the Appalachian Trail in the snow and located lost hikers'

‘Information we have indicates she is an ‘expert’ survivalist,’ Major Dan Jagoe of the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Office told Cumming Patch.

‘She has hiked the Appalachian Trail in the snow and located lost hikers.’

Authorities have not yet been able to offer an explanation as to why Mrs Lane would have run off to go camping without telling her family.

John Lane, her brother-in-law, told Cumming Patch before she was found at the weekend that her family were ‘worried sick’ about her.
