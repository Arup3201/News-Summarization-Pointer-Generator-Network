'You were a moody, disrespectful little brat' - these are the vulgar words of a high school teacher  just 24 hours after one of his 16-year-old students committed suicide.

Australian teacher Simon Cox posted the offensive rant, in which he also called the student a 'brat' and said he was happy he was 'gone', to his Facebook page.

He then targeted the boy's parents, saying they had made excuses for their son, before finishing his extraordinary post by describing the boy's death as unimportant, signing off with; 'Nothing special - now I've got to wash my hair.'

'You were a bully to kids smaller and younger than yourself, I saw you intimidate, stand over and beat up on younger kids (never anyone your own size),' The Northern Territory teacher posted.

Vulgar: Simon Cox posted a vulgar rant on his Facebook about a student who had just committed suicide

In his post, Mr Cox, pictured, accused the deceased teenager of making life 'hell' for other students and teachers

'You made life hell for genuine students wanting to learn and teachers trying to teach.

'You were a moody, disrespectful little brat in and away from school who was always given excuses by your parents and soft people in authority. Your (sic) gone, good no sympathy or empathy from me.

'Nothing special - now I've got to wash my hair.'

The boy's uncle, Peter Britten, said the family was left reeling by the shocking comments.

'It was unjustified,' he said. 'It seems (there was) a falling out between the teacher and the student.'

Mr Britten said the hundreds of tributes flooding the student's Facebook page were proof he was popular, loved and a 'good kid'.

'He was so loved by everyone. I can't fathom what went down,' he said.

'Any suggestion he was bad is not true... he was not a bully - he  definitely was not a bully.'

Struggling to comprehend why the teacher would post the message, Mr Britten said his nephew had had potential for a bright future.

'He was a stay at home kind of kid who looked up to his older brother who is a policeman and sister who is in the police, too.'

The teacher was stood down following his post and is expected to be fired for this Facebook post

The post was eventually passed on to the outraged parents of other students who, blown away by the callousness of Mr Cox's rant, immediately contacted the school.

Education department deputy chief executive Susan Bowden told MailOnline the department had been in contact with the family of the student regarding the post.

'(The department) deeply regrets the stress to family and friends caused by this teacher’s alleged actions,' she said.

'The matter was brought to the attention of the department by a staff member and there have been a number of subsequent complaints received in response to the teacher’s alleged actions.

'This type of behaviour by any teacher is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.'

Ms Bowden said Mr Cox was stood down on Tuesday, the same day the department became aware of the post. He has been given 24 hours to respond to the allegations.

A decision on the teacher's employment will be made once all evidence had been considered, Ms Bowden added.
