AFC Wimbledon powerhouse Bayo Akinfenwa wants to to wreck Steven Gerrard's final FA Cup and take the shirt off his back.

The Dons striker faces his hero in the Third Round of the FA Cup on Monday night after Gerrard revealed this will be his last season at Anfield.

'I want Gerrard's shirt,' footballs strongest man said. 'I've told the boys that if anyone get's his shirt before me we are going to have a problem. Especially with the announcement that this is his last FA Cup run with Liverpool.

'Gerrard is my guy and I look up to him and everything he has achieved in the game and I hope he is at the match on Monday.

'I will feel bad if I knock him out for a second and I would give him a massive hug but we are going into this game to win and these matches don't come around often.

'We're in League Two, we are not deluding ourselves. Liverpool are starting to find that form and we're not expected to win but we will give a good account of ourselves and this is The FA Cup, anything can happen.'

The 16-stone striker has grabbed nine goals so far this season and the lifelong Liverpool fan put his fancy footwork to good use when he saw the mouthwatering draw.

'I am a Liverpool supporter so even if I played in the Champions League final this would be the biggest game,' he added.

'I was doing a dance in my living room when I saw the draw. As a Liverpool supporter the three best feelings are; to play for the team, to play against the team and score against them. I have the opportunity to do two out of three and I hope I achieve them.

'I have nine goals by January and to get 10 against Liverpool would be something to look back on when I am finished. I would have to celebrate. I would be lying if I said my emotions wouldn't take over. I have this little dance set-up but I don't know if I will do it. We will have to wait and see.'
