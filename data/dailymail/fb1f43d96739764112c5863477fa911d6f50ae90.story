A lorry transporting brand new Range Rovers crashed on a busy dual carriageway last night, scattering its expensive cargo across both sides of the road.

The long-vehicle hit the central reservation and overturned, spilling several luxury cars worth more than £70,000 each and damaging the tarmac.

Police closed the A34, near Whitchurch, Hampshire, in both directions after the accident late last night and repair work is still taking place today.

Expensive spill: Police have closed the A34, near Whitchurch, Hampshire, in both directions after the long-vehicle hit the central reservation, scattering Range Rovers across the road, last night

Hampshire Constabulary’s roads 
policing unit posted on its Twitter account: 'A very expensive road 
traffic collision, thankfully nobody was hurt! Not much left of some nice Range Rovers!'

The transporter was driving north up 
the A34, between Bullington and Highclere, when it hit the central 
reservation, at around 11pm.

No one was hurt in the crash and no other vehicles were involved, police said.

Rush hour commuters were this morning
met with gridlock as the busy main artery was shut. It is expected to 
be closed for most of the day.

The lorry and all of the Range Rovers have now been removed, but work is still 
needed to clear spilled diesel and hydraulic fluid and repair extensive 
damage to the road surface.

Luxury: The brand new Range Rovers that were wrecked in the accident are similar to this latest model, which starts at £71,295

A spokesman for Hampshire 
Constabulary said: 'A transporter lorry carrying several vehicles was in
collision with the central barrier on the A34 northbound carriageway at
Whitchurch.

'Several 
vehicles being carried on the lorry came off and ended up in both 
carriageways. 'No other vehicles were involved and fortunately no one 
was injured.

'The road is likely to remain closed for most of Tuesday to allow for repairs to the road surface and barriers.'

A spokesman for the Highways Agency added: 'The A34 is expected to remain closed until at least the early afternoon. Road users are advised to leave plenty of time for their journeys and to avoid the area if possible, using alternative routes.'

The
spokesman added: 'Sections of the north and southbound carriageway have
been damaged and will need to be resurfaced, and around 100 metres of 
barrier in the central reservation also needs to be repaired before the 
road can be safely re-opened to traffic.
