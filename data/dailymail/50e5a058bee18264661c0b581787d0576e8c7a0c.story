AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin has sold his Melbourne home for a generous $1.73 million after settling into Sydney and his new role with the Sydney Swans.

The 27-year-old made a profit of $95,000 from the November sale of the four-bedroom house at 55 Hodder Street in Brighton East according to the settlement details revealed this week, Property Observer reports.

The former Hawthorn Hawks player purchased the modern two-storey house on a 678 square metre block for $1,635,000 back in 2010, with his recent sale reflecting an annual price gain of under 1.5 per cent.

The 27-year-old made a profit of $95,000 from the November sale of the four-bedroom house 

The sale took place prior to a scheduled auction just over a month after hitting the market, Nick Johnstone from Nick Johnstone Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia.

Franklin ended his nine-year association with Hawthorn last year when he penned a near $1 million-a-year deal to play for Sydney on a nine-year contract. 

Although there is no record of any Sydney property purchases under the star's name, he's understood to be living at Bondi in Sydney's east with girlfriend Jesinta Campbell.

Franklin has been the driving force behind Sydney's premiership bid this year and polled just four votes shy of a maiden Brownlow Medal. Having already claimed the Coleman Medal and All-Australian selection, Franklin was one of several favourites to win AFL's top prize.

Mr Johnstone said the property was 'a substantial four-bedroom home with a pool and a theatre room'. 

Franklin's luxury home is decked out with three generous living zones, four bedrooms and resort-style indoor/outdoor living centred around a pool. 

It even has its own cinema and a gourmet kitchen with butler's pantry. 

Mr Johnstone said Franklin originally lived in the house but turned it into a rental property at the end of 2013, when he signed with the Swans and relocated to Sydney.

'He has signed a nine-year contract with the Swans and he's living in Sydney now,' Mr Johnstone said.

Born in Perth, Franklin was picked by Hawthorn as the No.5 draft in the 2004 national draft.

He played in the 2013 AFL grand final, in which Hawthorn defeated Fremantle, and in Hawthorn's 2008 premiership-winning side against Geelong.

Franklin's  move to Sydney was reportedly signed and sealed well before the 2013 grand final win - but was only made public days after. 

The full-forward expressed his desire to move to Sydney and a deal was stitched up and kept tight lipped during Hawthorn's premiership campaign.

The club kept the deal under wraps for fear that if it was leaked it might disrupt the club's preparations for the flag.

His loyal girlfriend of one year, model Jesinta, was by his side to attend the special Sydney Swans Brownlow awards held in Sydney in November.

The Swans held their own Sydney-based ceremony so that the players could continue to train ahead of the Saturday's grand final.
