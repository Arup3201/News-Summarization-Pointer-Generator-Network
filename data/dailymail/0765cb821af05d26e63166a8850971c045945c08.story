A top American skier has spoken out about his experiences after the devastating avalanche that has left several dead - and his two teammates missing.

'I was swept 300 meters over a serac and down the mountain and came to a stop still in my sleeping bag, still inside the tent,' Glen Plake, the mohawked, outspoken Californian told EpicTV.

'I punched my way out of the tent and started searching.'

At least nine climbers were killed and six are believed still missing in Sunday's predawn avalanche on Mount Manaslu in Nepal, the eight largest mountain in the world. Plake's teammates Rémy Lécluse and Greg Costa are among the missing and presumed dead.

The avalanche hit at about 4 a.m. Sunday while more than two dozen climbers were sleeping in tents at Camp 3 on Mount Manaslu in northern Nepal.

At least nine climbers were killed and six are believed still missing. Many of the 10 survivors were injured and were flown to hospitals by rescue helicopters.

'It was a major, major accident. There are up to 14 people missing. There were 25 tents at Camp 3 [6800m] and all of them were destroyed, 12 tents at Camp 2 [6300m] were banged up and moved around,' Plake told EpicTV.

He was camping with Rémy Lécluse and Greg Costa before the avalanche struck, attempting to become the first team to ski the world's eighth highest peak without oxygen.

'Greg and I were in a tent together, Rémy was in another. It was 4:45a and I was in my sleeping bag with my headlamp on reading my devotional when we heard a roar,' Plake said.

'Greg looked at me and said, “That was a big gust of wind,” then a second later, “No, that was an avalanche.” Then it hit us.'

He said he was swept 300 meters down the mountain and came to a stop still inside his sleeping bag, inside the tent, still with his headlamp on.

'We all went to sleep with avalanche transceivers on so I punched my way out of the tent and started searching. I searched for 10 minutes before I realized I was barefoot in the snow,' he said. 'But there was no sign of Greg. Rémy and his tent are nowhere to be found.'

Rescuers reached the camp immediately, but weather forced them to call off the search.

'It’s a war zone up here,' Plake said. 'I’m OK, a bit beat up; missing some teeth and a bruised eye.'

He asked the reporter to do him one favor: 'Write in big capital letters, GLEN PLAKE IS ALIVE AND HE’S COMING HOME.'

'We won the lottery with this one,' Plake's father, James Plake, told ABC News.

'Glen does this kind of stuff all the time so we are always worried, but he called us instantly with this one, called Kimberly [wife], and said "whatever they say on the news I am alive and I'm OK."'

Helicopters flew over the slopes on Monday to search for the missing mountaineers as climbers and guides searched on foot.

Rescuers
brought down eight bodies — four French, one each from Germany, Italy 
and Spain and a Nepali guide — and were trying to retrieve the ninth 
from the 7,000-meter (22,960-foot) area where the avalanche struck, 
police Chief Basanta Bahadur Kuwar said.

Shock: Locals and climbers gather at the base camp of Mount Manaslu in northern Nepal after an avalanche killed at least nine people

Death: Bodies of climbers killed in an avalanche at Mount Manaslu lie covered with numbers at the Tribhuvan University Teaching hospital in Katmandu, Nepal, Monday, Sept. 24, 2012

Three French climbers and two Germans were transported to hospitals in Katmandu on Sunday. Two Italians were flown there on Monday — Italian climber Silvio Mondinelli, who has climbed the world's 14 highest peaks, and fellow mountaineer Christian Gobbi.

Mondinelli said a third Italian climber and their Sherpa guide were sleeping in another tent and both were buried by the avalanche and died.

Gobbi said they could not see at first when they looked out of their torn tent because it was pitch dark and they had no light.

'We found someone's boots and put them on,' he said.

When
the sun rose an hour later, they saw parts of tents scattered across 
the snow, along with people who had been killed or injured.

They
said they were able to assist the injured with the help of Sherpa 
guides who came up from lower mountain camps. Those who could walk made 
their way down to the base camp while those who were injured were picked
up by helicopters.

At least three of the victims were from the French Alps town of Chamonix, a hub for climbers on Mont Blanc and nearby peaks. An avalanche on a route to the summit of Mont Blanc in July killed nine experienced climbers.

Two French climbers were still unaccounted for as of Monday afternoon, the French Foreign Ministry said. The rescue effort was called off 'at least for today, probably definitively,' Christian Trommsdorff, president of the French Mountain Guides Syndicate, said on BFM television.

'We all went to sleep with avalanche 
transceivers on so I punched my way out of the tent and started 
searching.

I searched for 10 minutes before I realized I was barefoot in
the snow.

But there was no sign of Greg.

Rémy and his tent 
are nowhere to be found.'

A total of 231 climbers and guides were on the mountain, but not all were at the higher camps hit by the avalanche.

Nepal Mountaineering Department chief Balkrishan Ghimire identified the eight recovered bodies as Fabrice Priez, Philippe Lucien Bos, Catherine Marie Andree Richard and Ludovic Paul Nicolas Challeat of France; German Christian Mittermeyer; Italian Alberto Magliano; Spaniard Marti Roirg Gasull; and Nepali Dawa Dorji.

Sunday's avalanche came at the start 
of Nepal's autumn climbing season, when the end of the monsoon rains 
makes weather in the high Himalayas unpredictable. Spring is a more 
popular mountaineering season, when hundreds of climbers crowd the 
peaks.

Mount Manaslu, which 
is 8,156 meters (26,760 feet) high, has attracted more climbers recently
because it is considered one of the easier peaks to climb among the 
world's tallest mountains.

Nepal has eight of the 14 highest peaks in the world. Climbers have said in recent years that conditions on the mountains have deteriorated and risks of accidents have increased, with some blaming global warming.

Avalanches are not very frequent on Mount Manaslu, but in 1972 one struck a team of climbers and killed six Koreans and 10 Nepalese guides.

Ang Tshering of the Asian Trekking agency in Katmandu, who has equipped hundreds of expeditions, said low snow levels and the increased number of climbers on Manaslu have made climbing conditions difficult.

'It used to be a low-risk mountain in the past but now that has all changed,' Tshering said, adding that conditions have become more unpredictable.
