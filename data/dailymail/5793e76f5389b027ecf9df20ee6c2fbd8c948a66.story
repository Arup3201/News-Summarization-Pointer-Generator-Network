Josh Gordon 

Cleveland Browns star wide receiver Josh Gordon has been reinstated into the NFL and had his one-year suspension reduced to 10 games after the league announced changes to its drug policy.

The league and Players' Association reached an agreement on Friday on revisions to the substance-abuse program. Earlier this week, they announced changes on performance-enhancing drugs.

Gordon, who has at least four drug violations, has already served two games of the suspension. He will be eligible to play November 23 when the Browns visit Atlanta.

Gordon's appeal of a season-long ban was upheld on Aug. 22. Under the new provisions, Gordon will be allowed to work out and attend team meetings. Before the changes, Gordon was only permitted to meet with his clinician at the team's facility.

Despite being suspended for two games last season, Gordon led the league with 1,646 yards receiving.
