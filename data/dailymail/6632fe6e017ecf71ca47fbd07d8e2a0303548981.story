An ESPN anchor suspended for making an offensive remark when referring to New York Knicks star Jeremy Lin has defended himself on Twitter. 

Anchor Max Bretos has been taken off-air for 30 days for using the phrase 'Chink in the armor' when talking about the basketball player who is of Asian descent.

ESPN writer Antony Federico was fired after using the same phrase in a story headline on their mobile website after the Knicks lost to New Orleans on Friday.

On Twitter Bretos said: 'My wife is Asian, would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and that community.

'Wanted 2 apologize 2 all those I have upset. Not done with any racial reference. Despite intention, phrase was inappropriate in this context.'

Bretos said he had learned from the gaffe and that he would make 'every effort' to avoid something like this happening again.

Federico also apologised for his blunder - and said he was not trying to be offensive.

'This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny,' he told the New York Daily News. 'I'm so sorry that I offended people. I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy.'

The headline appeared on the ESPN mobile website between 2.30am and 3.05am on Saturday morning.

He added that he had used the same headline on stories at least a hundred times before and did not think anything of it.

Apology: Anchor Max Bretos apologised on Twitter for using the phrase 'Chink in the armor' when talking about Lin's poor performance in New York's loss to New Orleans

The American basketball star said after
 leading the Knicks to a 104-97 win over Dallas yesterday that he did 
not think the commentator or headline writer meant to offend.

'I don't think it was on purpose or whatever, but (at) the same time they have apologised,' he said.

'And so from my end I don't care 
anymore. Have to learn to forgive, and I don't even think that was 
intentional. Or hopefully not.'

In a statement released yesterday, ESPN apologized
 for the headline and also said they are aware of other ‘offensive and 
inappropriate’ comments on ESPN outlets.

ESPN says a similar reference was made on Friday on ESPN Radio New York, but the commentator was not one of their employees.

Lin is the NBA's first American-born 
player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent. He has captivated fans by 
leading the Knicks to seven straight wins before Friday's loss against New Orleans.

This is not the first time that his ethnicity has sparked some racial taboos.

Fox Sports columnist Jason Whitlock 
played on an Asian stereotype after a very successful game by Lin when 
he tweeted 'Some lucky lady in NYC is gonna feel a couple inches of pain
 tonight.'

Though he was not fired, Mr Whitlock 
later apologized for the comment after pressure from the Asian American 
Journalists Association.

Another incident occurred during 
Wednesday’s game against the Sacramento Kings, the Madison Square Garden
 television network flashed a graphic of the player’s face over a 
cracked fortune cookie that had a message which read ‘The Knicks Good 
Fortune’.

The news 
comes after the 6ft 3in athlete made an application to hold on to his 
'Linsanity' trademark to appear on t-shirts, action figures and other 
merchandise. Two other organisations tried to get hold of it.

Without ownership of 'Linsanity,' others would be unable legally to use the word without consent.

Speaking to the Huffington Post, Washington D.C. trademark
attorney Josh Gerben said that the multiple claims for Mr Lin's word
- by the athlete as well as the two men who are both from California - will most
likely turn into a procedural air ball.

That would cost the two competing men time and money for the
win, he notes.

The first man to apply for the trademark on February 7 - six days before Mr Lin - is a
man named Yenchin Chang of Taiwanese descent, like the athlete.

His word: Fans of Mr Lin spelled out his word 'linsanity' in New York's Madison Square Garden Wednesday which according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's online database, more than one have applied for ownership of

Competition: A rising start for the Knicks who just ended a seven-game winning streak, Mr Lin's clashing trademark filing is expected to take extended time and money to settle with him against two others

'I wanted to be a part of the
excitement,' he said in a phone interview with Bloomberg News. 'I'm very proud of Jeremy.'

While also knowing the lucrative business opportunity before him, Mr Chang admits
potential willingness to sell the ownership to Mr Lin or any other if gained.

'I'll think about it when that time comes,' he said. 'Right
now, I just want to have some fun with it.'

The second man to file trademark rights is Andrew W Slayton
who filed on February 9.

Mr Slayton said he once coached Mr Lin in high school but
now works as a physical education teacher at a Los Altos high school.

Profit: One of the two men who have filed for the word's trademark owns a website that sells t-shirts carrying the athlete's name in various adaptations for slogans like 'born to Lin'

In 2010 he purchased the domain Linsanity.com, selling men’s
and women's t-shirts that carry such slogans as 'Lin your face,' and 'born to
Lin.'

Some also carry Mr Lin's number 17.

'It's clear that he is trying to sell merchandise using the
New York Knicks brand,' Mr Gerben said after seeing the t-shirt's blue and
orange colours and references to the 'Garden,' or Madison Square Garden where
the Knicks play in Manhattan.

'He should be very careful,' he said.

The US Trademark and Patent Office reports it has not
granted 'Linsanity' to any one applicant pending a review of all who have
applied.
