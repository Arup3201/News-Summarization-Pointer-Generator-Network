Amir Khan has added to his collection of top-of-the-range cars with a brand new white Mercedes S63, which he has shown off on social media.

Khan took to his social media account to show how pleased he was with his new purchase, writing: 'Finally got my hands on the #S63'.

Khan recently caused a stir after claiming that he thought the proposed fight between Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather will never happen. 

'Honestly that fight will never happen, in my opinion,' he told BT Sport.   

'I spoke to Manny Pacquiao and, obviously, we speak to Mayweather and his team

'I can't really see that fight happening, there is too much politics with that fight. There's different promotions teams and different management teams - I don't think they will let that fight happen.'
