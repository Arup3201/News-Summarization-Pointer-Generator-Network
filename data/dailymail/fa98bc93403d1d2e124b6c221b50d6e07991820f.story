Iran has admitted it has elite guards in Syria helping Bashar al-Assad's forces subdue rebel fighters.

The top commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard said the elite unit has high-level advisers in Syria, and warned it would get involved if al-Assad's forces came under attack.

Comments made yesterday by Mohammad Ali Jafari were the clearest indication yet that Iran is directly assisting its Arab ally in fighting rebels.

But Ali Jafari yesterday denied that the presence of elite troops in Syria counted as military help.

He said: 'A number of members of the Qods force are present in Syria but this does not constitute a military presence.'

Ali Jafari claimed his men were only providing Syria with 'intellectual and advisory help'.

Sunday's comments by Jafari were the first official remarks of their kind, and mark the clearest indication of Iran's direct assistance to its main Arab allies: Assad and Lebanon's Hezbollah.

It also suggests Tehran is wary about being drawn into a Middle East conflict if outside forces attack Assad, who is locked in a civil war with rebel forces.

The revelations about Iran's involvement came as more government airstrikes in Syria destroyed buildings

Iran has backed Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the crisis began almost 18 months ago

Jafari told reporters that Quds force members have been in Syria and Lebanon as advisers for a long time, but was not more specific.

He says decisions about whether to boost military aid to Syria if attacked would 'depend on the circumstances.'

In early August, members of the Free Syrian Army abducted 48 Iranians, whom they claimed were members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.

After first denying their military roles, Iran later said the hostages were 'retired' military members on a pilgrimage.

A Free Syrian Army commander later told al-Jazeera that his brigade had 'intelligence information' and 'documents' showing that the group belonged to the Revolutionary Guards and had come to Syria to 'serve the regime'.

Iran has backed Syria's President Bashar al-Assad since the crisis began almost 18 months ago, and regards his rule as a key part of its axis of resistance against Israel and Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
