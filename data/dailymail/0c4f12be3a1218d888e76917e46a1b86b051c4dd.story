A wealthy businessman has been beaten about the head with a hammer during a £75,000 gems raid at his luxury home.

Haulage boss Mark Schofield, 57, and his 58-year old partner Sue Evans were asleep in bed when three thugs wearing balaclavas burst into their bedroom at 4.30am demanding cash and jewellery.

As Mr Schofield sat up in bed one of the gang hit him in the head with a hammer before they tore a Rolex watch from the wrist of Miss Evans.

They then stole his Rolex, a diamond ring and a Louis Vuitton handbag before fleeing in Mr Schofield's 2006 Porsche Cayenne.

The couple said they had been left badly shaken up by the incident and are stepping up security at his isolated £500,000 Georgian home in Turton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The property is currently undergoing a refurbishment meaning that large parts were not covered by the property's alarm system at the time of the raid on Tuesday.

Today, Mr Schofield, director of MS Transport in Bolton, showed off his horrific injuries and said: 'The incident was absolultely terrifying and I feared for my life.

'I had absolutely no idea what these guys were capable of and I should be lucky I'm still here in the land of the living given I was hit over the head with a hammer.'

He added: 'I am a light sleeper and I heard a bang at about 4am, which woke me up.

'I wasn't sure what was going on but thought no more about it. Then 15 minutes later, after dropping off to sleep again, I could hear footsteps and then all of a sudden the bedroom door burst open.

The balaclava-clad gang managed to steal two £30,000 Rolex watches, a diamond ring, a Louis Vuitton handbag and the couple's 2006 Porsche Cayenne

The thieves broke into the house on Greens Arms Road in the Turton area of Bolton, Greater Manchester while the family were asleep

'It was pitch black and then there was this almighty roar. Before I could react three mean wearing balaclavas were at our bedside and all hell broke loose then.

'They were screaming at the top of their voices. They were saying 'where's your stuff' and 'give us your stuff'. One of them turned the light on and saw Sue was wearing a Rolex.

'She tried to tell them that she would give them the watch but they were trying to tear it from her wrist. I sat up and tried to grab one of them and, with his left hand but he hit me across the head with the hammer and shouted 'where's yours'.

'Blood went everywhere and the blow really knocked me back.

Mr Schofield, from Greater Manchester, said: 'The incident was absolutely terrifying'

'It was very quick they took the watches and some other jewellery and then started shouting that they wanted our mobile phones.

'I told them that the phones were downstairs so they ran downstairs and then left. I saw them driving off in my Porsche.'

The couple have lived together at the detached property in rural Greens Arms Road, Turton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, for around 12 months.

About 30 officers attended the incident and crime scene investigators spent all day searching the area and CCTV from local properties is being reviewed.

Miss Evans said: 'It was awful, we were petrified. I could hear Mark's head smash and there was blood everywhere. He could have been killed

'I got out of bed and kept pressing the panic button to our alarm. One of the men put the hammer on my hand and he took the Rolex off my wrist.'

The gang dropped Mr Saunders' wallet and a jewellery box on the driveway as they ran for the Porsche.

Lancashire Police said the burglars had arrived in a white Ford Fiesta which was later found dumped in nearby Chapeltown.

It is thought the gang arrived in the stolen car and crept through a nearby field to approach the house from the rear. They then broke in to the property through French doors.

Detective Sergeant Marc Saunders, said: 'This was a nasty and unprovoked attack on a couple while they were sleeping. They were lucky.

'We believe the Ford Fiesta had been stolen about 7pm the night before the burglary. We believe the vehicle had been abandoned by the thieves who left the scene in the Porsche Cayenne.'

'I appeal for anyone who saw anything suspicious in Turton in the days leading up to the burglary to come forward.'
