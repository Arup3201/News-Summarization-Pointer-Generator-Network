With fists as quick as his own, Amir Khan is not someone you would assume needs much protection outside of the boxing ring. 

But during his recent trip to Pakistan to lend his support to the victims of the Peshawar school shooting massacre, Khan was made aware of the security measures currently being taken in the homeland of his parents.

The 28-year-old posted images to his Instagram account, including a photograph of his armed entourage, writing: 'En route to press conference in Lahore. #Pakistan'

The former world light welterweight champion and Olympic silver medallist has vowed to help rebuild the Army Public School in the city where more than 140 pupils and staff died at the hands of the Pakistani Taliban.

He condemned the attacks as "absolutely horrific and sickening" and donated to the school the pair of shorts - worth £30,000 with a waistband made from 24-carat gold threading - which he wore in his recent victory against American rival Devon Alexander
