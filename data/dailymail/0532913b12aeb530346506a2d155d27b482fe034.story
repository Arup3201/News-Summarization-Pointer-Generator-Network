This is the secret compartment a conman built in his lock-up to hide an £88,000 classic car from the authorities.

Fraudster Alan Dykes made a false wall in the storage unit where he sneakily kept the Jaguar XK120.

The 55-year-old, from Poole in Dorset, had been convicted in 2011 of obtaining a money transfer of £45,000 by deception.

Deception: Alan Dykes hid the vintage Jaguar in this secret compartment to conceal it from police officers, to no avail. He has now been jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice

In the confiscation hearing that 
followed he told the authorities he had no realisable assets and that 
his beloved Jaguar had gone abroad.

But a police investigation led them to a set of agricultural buildings linked to Dykes and an eagle-eyed officer noticed one stud wall protruded 2ft from another.

Officers knocked the flimsy wall down to find the silver Jaguar behind it.

Dykes was re-arrested and charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice.

He was found guilty and jailed for a year.

His car will be signed over to Dorset Police and sold in order to raise the £68,000 he made out of his deception and to cover the court costs involved.

Detective Sergeant Andrew Kennard, of Dorset Police, said: 'It sends a message that you can't hide this kind of asset and expect to get away with it.

'The investigative work that led to finding the Jaguar was a good old-fashioned bit of detective work.

'Without finding the Jaguar, we would never have identified the fact that he had committed perjury or perverting the course of justice.'

The XK120 was launched at the 1948 London Motor Show as a show car for the new Jaguar XK engine but was such a hit Jaguar put the model into production.

In 1949 the first production car was delivered to superstar actor Clark Gable.
