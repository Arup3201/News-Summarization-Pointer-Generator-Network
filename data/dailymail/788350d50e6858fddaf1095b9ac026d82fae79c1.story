Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao may only be nine days away from touching gloves but that hasn't stopped them rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous. 

While Pacquiao was making another appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Mayweather was welcoming Mariah Carey to his gym.

Carey has long been a fan of Mayweather having attended his fight against Shane Mosley in 2010.

Pacquiao, meanwhile, made his latest appearance on Kimmel's talk show and delighted the audience with a rendition of his walk-in song.

Written by the boxer himself, the song is called 'I Fight for the Filipino People' and Kimmel even joined in with the 36-year-old.

Pacquiao and Mayweather have come face-to-face just once in the build-up, at the press conference to announce the fight.

Mayweather will make the short trip from his gym to the MGM Grand next week while Pacquiao will fly in from his Los Angeles base.
