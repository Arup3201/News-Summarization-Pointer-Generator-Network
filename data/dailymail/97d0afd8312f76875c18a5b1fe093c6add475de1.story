Iain Duncan Smith will today suggest that Britain will never be able to compete on the world stage unless his welfare reforms are put at the heart of the economic recovery plan.

The Work and Pensions Secretary will make a speech outlining how reducing dependency on welfare is getting more British people into work. He will say: ‘The core and point of the economic plan, the driving force, is the quality of the people who make it happen – the British people – for no plan can work unless their well-being is at the heart of it.

‘But none of this is deliverable if we don’t deal with the British domestic problem. The economy can never be where it should, holding its own in this tough world market place, unless British families play a full productive part in that plan.’

Mr Duncan Smith will also say that half of the jobs created under Labour were filled by foreign nationals, while many Britons were ‘in a cycle of dependency’.

But in the past year a million jobs have been created and three quarters have gone to Britons.

It comes as analysts said that Britain is in a period of low wage growth, meaning the Bank of England could delay the expected rise in interest rates until next year.

The amount that those in work are earning is not growing as fast as expected.

Governor Mark Carney will present his latest predictions on the economy in his quarterly inflation report on Wednesday. 

Wage growth is key to boosting the economy so once this it is on track it is likely interest rates will start to rise to prevent inflation.

The inflation report will give the best indication yet on whether rates are likely to rise before the end of 2014. Experts last night said the decision was on a ‘knife edge’.
