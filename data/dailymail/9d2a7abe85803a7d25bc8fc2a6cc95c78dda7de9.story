The mystery over a honeymoon couple presumed dead in a boating accident 60 years ago has been reignited - after a witness said they never even boarded the vessel thought to have claimed their lives.

Thomas and Dorothy have long been presumed to have died in a notorious boat accident on Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, in 1954.

But an investigator has now raised the possibility that the boating accident was cover for the couple to vanish and begin a new life.

Six people were confirmed dead in the Missouri lake's worst ever accident - and officials added the Faheys to the death toll after they went missing the same day.

The couple had expressed an interest in boarding the doomed boat named Grand Galize but doubt remains over whether they were in fact aboard.

Honeymoon tragedy: Thomas and Dorothy Fahey were believed to have drowned in a boating accident, but their bodies were never found and the were not documented passengers on the boat

Now the Coast Guard pilot in charge of the vessel on that fateful day says he is certain they never boarded the boat

'We are very, very certain they were not on the Grand Glaize,' Captain Charlie Meyer, a United States Coast Guard licensed boat pilot and afficionado of the Grand Glaize mystery told KOMU.

'We're not even sure they drowned.'

Confirmed dead at the time were Letha Rockwell, 50, and daughter, Rosalyn Ruth Rockwell, 16, of Belle Plaine, Iowa; Mrs Richard Lamberty and her two-year-old son, Warren of Fremont, Nebraska; Duaine Hodges, 19, of Missouri Valley, Iowa; and Patricia Gump, 16, of Tunas, Missouri. Gump's body was never recovered after the accident.

Meyer has spent years pondering the mystery of the Faheys disappearance.

Honeymoon: The couple were staying at the Lazy Days Resort, where their car and belongings were found

Mystery: The couple took these pictures of each other in front of their cabin at the Lazy Days Resort just before they went missing

'This is a true, 60-year-old story that has all the elements of many mysteries, docudramas and other headline-grabbing stories,' Meyer said in a written compilation of newspaper articles and court records.

The couple had married on May 22 in Chicago and were on a two-week honeymoon.

They were reported missing from Lazy Days Resort where they had been staying after they had been absent a few days and their car was found in a parking lot near Bagnell Dam.

According to the Lake News, the couple had written a postcard to family saying that they were going to accompany friends to the boat but that they wouldn't be boarding it themselves.Â 

The only explanation their families could think of was that they had changed their minds.

Meyer has worked on many hypotheses. Did they escape unknown problems to another country? Did they have underworld ties in Chicago and knew too much? Or did they simply die in the boating accident, having decided at the last minute to board the ship, and still lie somewhere at the bottom of the lake?

At around 2pm on May 28, 1954, a sudden, violent storm threw the Grand Glaize on its back, depositing all of its passengers in the water.

Final correspondence: Dorothy Fahey sent this postcard to her father just days before she and her new husband disappeared

Paid up: The two had booked to stay at Lazy Days Resort until early June, but disappeared without a trace on 28 May, 1954

Seven people were rescued. Six bodies were recovered, while three, those of Gump and the Faheys, were never found.

The search for missing passengers was called off a few days after the accident.

The Lake News Online reports that experts say it is nearly impossible for three bodies from the same accident to never surface.

According to a report in the Chicago Tribune at the time, the Faheys were 'presumed' to have died in the tragedy, reports the Lake News.

Meyer recently spoke to Junior Graham, the pilot of the Grand Glaize on the day of the accident.

'He seemed very confident that they were not aboard, and he had to struggle to try to remember how they were even involved,' Meyer told the Lake News Online.

A memorial wreath was laid in the lake on Wednesday at the approximate site of where the Grand Glaize overturned.
