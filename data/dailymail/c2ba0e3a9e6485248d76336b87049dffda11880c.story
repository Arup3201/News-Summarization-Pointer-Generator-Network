Florida police are investigating after cell phone footage emerged of officers appearing to put a boy in a choke hold and kicking him to the ground.

The Boynton Beach force has put one officer on administrative leave as it investigates how police treated two grade six students who had been taken off a school bus on Thursday last week.

As the youngsters, who are thought to be 11 years old, are handcuffed and made to sit on the sidewalk, their classmates filmed from the window of the bus.Â

Witnessed: The arrest of the two students, who were handcuffed on a Florida sidewalk, was filmed by classmates on a school bus

In one piece of footage, an officer appears to put one of the detained teenagers in a choke hold, before marching him towards a grass embankment.

In a second film, as a boy is handcuffed an officer walks over and appears to kick the student's legs, forcing him to fall to the ground.

The boys had been removed from the school bus because of reports of minor misbehavior, Gawker reported.

A police spokesman said that no formal complaints had been made about the incident, but the audio in the footage shows the shock other students had at what was happening.

At first, there was a sense of excitement on the bus as the students discussed the arrests of their classmates, while an adult could be heard in the background ordering them to sit down.

But as the alleged rough handling of the boys was witnessed, the youngsters sounded shocked.

'Boom!' one can be heard saying on the footage of the second film, as the boy being arrested appears to be kicked to the ground.

'They can't do that,' another child on the bus is heard saying.

After putting one of the officers involved on administrative leave, a police spokesman confirmed that the force was 'investigating the circumstances surrounding this situation'.

'We are concerned as to the initial appearance of the video, and despite the fact that we have received no formal complains at this time, we are committed to reviewing the situation,' the spokesman said.

They added that after the incident had been reviewed, the police would take 'whatever action is deemed most appropriate'.
