A Utah man whose dog was killed by police officers this summer plans to sue Salt Lake City for at least $1.5 million.

Sean Kendall's 2-year-old Weimaraner, Geist, was shot on June 18 while cops were looking for a 3-year-old non-verbal boy who had been reported missing.

While looking for the boy, Officer Brett Olsen entered Kendall's backyard and — feeling 'threatened' by the dog — shot him dead.  

The boy was found less than an hour later, sleeping in his own basement.

Geist confronted cops when they entered his human's backyard in June. Officer Brett Olsen said he felt 'threatened' by Geist and shot him dead. The missing child was found sleeping in his own home minutes later

Kendall, 27, on Wednesday filed the initial paperwork necessary to sue Salt Lake City.

'Geist was robbed of the vast majority of his life, and Kendall was robbed of Geist’s continued life with him, which cannot be replaced any more than a child or other family member can be replaced,' Kendall wrote in his notice of claim, filed by attorney Ross Anderson, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

'Also, Kendall has suffered, and continues to suffer, severe and intense emotional pain, anguish, grief and trauma.'

Hundreds of people have rallied outside Salt Lake City police headquarters to protest Geist's shooting.

Many took their pets to the demonstrations as they demanded for Officer Olsen to be fired.

Kendall, 27, says Geist was robbed of his life and that he has suffered intense anguish after his dog was killed

An internal investigation found that Olsen, a 10-year veteran at the police department, violated no policies.

City officials offered Kendall $10,000 as a settlement, but he turned it down. He said he wants for officers to be properly trained on how to handle animals.

He also wants Salt Lake City PD to change its policies on using force against animals.

'I understand the concern for a missing child,' Kendall has said. 

'But that doesn't negate my rights as a property owner — and it doesn't replace my dog.'

Geist's death has inspired hundreds of people in Salt Lake City to demand better training for cops on how to handle domestic animals and when to use force against them
