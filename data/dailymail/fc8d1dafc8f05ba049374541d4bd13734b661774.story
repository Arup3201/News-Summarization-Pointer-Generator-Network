Two brothers accused of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris were on a British watch and no-fly list, it can be revealed.

Cherif, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, had been identified as a potential terror threat and placed on the list in case they tried to enter the UK or transit through a British airport.

The pair were added to the list as potential extremists, after the younger brother was convicted on terrorism charges in 2008 and rubbed shoulders behind bars with known jihadis who had trained with Al Qaeda and visited Osama Bin Laden’s headquarters.

US intelligence placed the brothers on the list as the same time as the Britons raising further questions over why they were not monitored more closely by the French.

Two brothers accused of murdering 12 in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris had already been flagged as a terrorist threat and placed on a U.S. no-fly list.

Heavily armed police SWAT teams have been swarming a region north of Paris as part of the hunt for the two gunmen - who are currently surrounded in a design company's office where they are holding a hostage.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls confirmed both men were known to security services prior to the fatal attack. 

A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there.

The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq.

Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said. 

French President Francois Hollande called for tolerance after the country's worst terrorist attack in decades.

He said: 'France has been struck directly in the heart of its capital, in a place where the spirit of liberty - and thus of resistance - breathed freely.'

French police have launched a major counter-terrorism operation following the attack on Tuesday 

French police have arrested nine people who were connected to the brothers while 90 witnesses have also been interviewed. 

Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed that Cherif Kouachi left his ID card behind in the getaway car used during the attack.  

Security officials confirmed that the brothers were born in Paris to Algerian parents. 

The younger brother, who was a former pizza delivery driver, appeared on a 2005 documentary in French TV on Islamic extremism. He was jailed in 2008 for 18 months after he tried to travel to Iraq to join al-Qaeda.  

During the documentary, Cherif Kouachi said he had been radicalised in north eastern Paris by a hard-line preacher. 

He said the cleric told him 'that holy texts prove the benefits of suicide attacks. It is written in the texts that it's good to die as a martyr.'

The brothers grew up in the multi-ethnic working-class 19th arrondissement of Paris.

Cherif Kouachi's lawyer said at the time that his client had fallen in with the wrong crowd.

During the trial, Kouachi was said to have undergone only minimal training for combat — going jogging in a Paris park to shape up and learning how a Kalashnikov automatic rifle works by studying a sketch.

He was described at the time as a reluctant holy warrior, relieved to have been stopped by French counterespionage officials from taking a Syria-bound flight that was ultimately supposed to lead him to the battlefields of Iraq.

The two brothers were filmed shouting 'we have killed Charlie Hebdo' after the murderous attack 

His former lawyer Vincent Ollivier told Le Parisien newspaper that his client had changed him.  

In the documentary, the younger killer is seen as a young man in a black T-shirt with extremely close-cropped hair and a chunky wristwatch was keener on spending time with pretty girls than on going to the mosque.

He appears relaxed and smiling as he pals around with friends.

At one point, with his baseball cap worn backward, Kouachi belts out some rap music and breaks into a joyful dance.

After he was released from prison, he worked in a supermarket's fish section in the Paris suburbs for six months beginning in 2009. Supervisors said he gave no cause for concern.

In 2010, police detained him again in a probe of an alleged plot to free an Islamic militant sentenced to life in prison for bombing a Paris train line in 1995. Kouachi was ultimately released with no charges ever brought.

Much less has become public about the older brother, Said, but Cazeneuve said the jobless resident of the city of Reims was also known to authorities, despite having never been prosecuted, because he was 'on the periphery' of the illegal activities his younger sibling was involved in. 

A French security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that American authorities had shared intelligence with France indicating that Said had travelled to Yemen several years ago for training.

French authorities were seeking to verify the information, the official said.

In Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris, Said frequented a prayer room on the ground floor of an apartment building, according to the local imam, Abdul-Hamid al-Khalifa.

Al-Khalifa admitted that Said wore traditional North Africa clothes to prayers and didn't mix much — if at all — with other worshippers.

'Typically, he'd come late to prayers and leave right when they were done.' 

A third suspect identified by French authorities in the attack turned himself in Wednesday night. Mourad Hamyd, 18, surrendered at a police station after learning his name had been linked to the case in the news, said Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor.

She did not specify his relationship to the Kouachis.
