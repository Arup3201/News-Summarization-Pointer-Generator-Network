Awkward question: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls confirmed that he is prepared to borrow more money for more public spending

Labour is prepared to borrow yet more money to pay for increased public spending on infrastructure projects, Ed Balls insisted yesterday.

The Shadow Chancellor said it would be ‘economically very foolish’ to rule out increasing borrowing to fund roadbuilding and other projects.

His intervention came after Labour leader Ed Miliband used a weekend speech to try to boost his party’s credibility on the economy, admitting it would not be able to reverse any of the Government’s spending cuts unless savings could be made elsewhere.

Chancellor George Osborne will use Wednesday’s spending review to set out plans to invest an extra £15 billion in capital spending over the course of the next Parliament.

Unusually, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander will make a further statement to the Commons the following day setting out details of infrastructure spending, with dozens of road projects expected to get the go-ahead.

Mr Balls confirmed yesterday that Labour would stick, for the first year of a government at least, to the coalition’s day-to-day spending plans.

On ‘day to day spending, we’re saying we’ll have to make changes within their plans; we’re not going to be spending more,’ the shadow Chancellor said.

But he went on: ‘On capital spending, we’re saying this year and next year, the Chancellor should be investing to get the economy growing.

Head to head: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, left, with Chancellor George Osborne argued today about how they would rescue the British economy, although Labour has been forced to adopt some of the coalition's plans

‘I’m not going to say to you today two years ahead what our judgement will be. We’ll wait till nearer the time. But do I think there is a case, could be a case in two years’ time for still investing in roads and our infrastructure to get the economy moving and the deficit down? Yes.

‘The reason is because if the economy is still weak then, living standards are still falling, if youth unemployment is still high and if there’s still a case on our long-term infrastructure to get things moving with interest rates low, of course there’s a case for doing that. It would be economically very foolish to deny that.’

The Conservatives seized on Mr Balls’ remarks as evidence that Mr Miliband’s claim his party would show ‘discipline’ was meaningless.

Sparring match: Mr Balls said on the Andrew Marr Show that if he became Chancellor he would consider borrowing more for major infrastructure building immediately

Economic Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid said: ‘Ed Miliband’s spending “discipline” has barely lasted five minutes as Ed Balls admits Labour would still spend more and borrow more. That’s the same old Labour approach that got us into this mess in the first place.

‘Hardworking people would pay the price with higher interest rates and higher bills.’

Mr Osborne insisted yesterday that while the economy now appeared to be ‘out of intensive care’, it could slide back into crisis if the Government abandons its austerity programme.

The Chancellor told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that the budget deficit was still too high and he was committed to finding further savings in Whitehall spending worth £11.5 billion.

‘There certainly is a chance of a 
relapse if we abandon our economic plan,’ he said, arguing that instead 
of ‘learning the lessons of what went wrong on their watch’ Labour was 
making it clear ‘they would still borrow more’.

Accusations: Ed Balls maintained that if Mr Osborne had borrowed more money to spend on building 'we wouldn't have had such a flat-lining economy'

‘I think we are moving from rescue to recovery, and you can see that because the economy’s growing, unemployment is coming down, there’s a record number of people in work.

‘Now it’s still going to be of course a challenge because the economic problems that Britain built up over many years are considerable and you can see what’s happening elsewhere in the world, but I think we are out of intensive care and our job now is to secure the recovery.

‘I think if Britain suddenly said we don’t have the confidence to deal with our debts, we’re not prepared to confront our problems as a nation, then we would go back into intensive care. And that’s what this week is all about. It’s about making clear that we are going to secure that recovery.

‘We’re going to go on taking the difficult decisions, go on cutting back spending, go on prioritising spending on the things that help the economy and cutting the spending that doesn’t.’
