Buried in the Sierra Nevada jungle in the north of a country that is assailed by preconceptions, Colombia’s Lost City remains a lot like Colombia itself - unexplored and off-limits for most travellers.

The thrilling journey to reach these ruins left by the Tayrona civilization could provide a good starting point for a classic Indian Jones adventure.

But while it is mainly the long decades of drug-related violence that have kept tourists away from Colombia, it was a much more romantic turn of events that resulted in this archaeological marvel being largely hidden from the world.

Travellers attempting to reach Colombia's 'Lost City' must make a 15-mile trek into the Sierra Nevada jungle

Locally referred to as La Ciudad Perdida, these intriguing leftovers are believed to have been built around 800AD - and were only stumbled upon by accident by tropical bird hunters in the early 1970s, five centuries after the Tayrona Amerindians had fled the area following the Spanish invasion.

During the interim, the remains of the city were lost from sight, consumed by the jungle.

But now, they could be Colombia's answer to Machu Picchu - having been painstakingly cleared and opened up to tourists.

Of course, visitors have to get there first - and the gruelling 15-mile trek is no mean feat.

The journey is traditionally offered as a five-day trip. My local guide Pedro looks at me in slight disbelief when I tell him I want to attempt the journey in three.

Take a look: The route into the jungle offers breathtaking views of Colombia's Sierra Nevada mountain range 

He has, he informs me, only done this a handful of times before.

‘Are you sure?’ he enquires.

The reason for his trepidation becomes clear when we set off the next morning.

Within half an hour of our departure, we are briskly negotiating a steep two-mile climb.

It seems to go on forever.

Eventually, the dusty track which has been carved into the mountainside spits us into dense jungle.

Had this been Colombia’s rainy season (between April and November), it would have been virtually impossible to tackle such a treacherous route in such a short amount of time.

But the forecast on this occasion is dry, the slopes are firm underfoot, and the rivers are low.

Only another seven hours to go today: The route to La Ciudad Perdida is challenging, particularly during the rainy season between April and November, when the steep slopes become wet and the rivers are high

Instead, we quickly find that our main obstacle is the stifling jungle heat. 

From now on, all of my belongings seem to be wet. A good supply of shirts and quick-drying garments is a must on a trip like this.

Some much needed respite from the sticky humidity comes as we make our first lunch stop.

We waste no time diving into the icy water behind our camp to cool off underneath the waterfall and the deserted plunge pools of the Buritaca River.

Usually this would be the place for the first overnight stop.

But our three-day itinerary means we now pack up and press on, meandering through the forest and past a succession of primitive villages - still inhabited by groups of local Kogi Amerindians who work in the forest, dressed in their Stetson hats and Wellington boots.

Making a splash: Much needed respite from the sticky humidity is offered by plunge pools in the Buritaca River

Steady as he goes: River are crossed by wading through the water barefoot. During the wet season, the rivers can reach waist height and backpackers are often toppled by the strong currents

Four more hours of steady marching take us to our camp for the evening. We arrive just before nightfall. 

It has been a steady seven hours on foot. 'Beds' for the night, visible in the failing light, will be the hammocks which hang from the rafters of a small wooden cabin by the river’s edge.

In the absence of electricity, dinner is prepared over a log fire and eaten by candlelight on long 'banquet' tables. These also accommodate a group of backpackers who are wearily making their return journey from the Lost City.

Those hankering after an old-fashioned adventure will be right at home in this jungle.

It offers an experience as authentic as it is challenging – although the odd luxury can still be found in the form of fresh grilled fish and a chilled beer at dinnertime.

Humble accommodation: Walkers en route to the Ciudad Perdida sleep in hammocks slung from shelters 

Welcome fuel: Dinner of grilled fish (and cold beer) being prepared on a wood-burning stove at the campsite

The next morning, we set off at 6am, after watching the sun rise over breakfast.

I have managed a surprisingly good night’s sleep in my hammock, with the only interruption coming from the concerto of noise provided by the local wildlife.

A combination of chirping and humming plays out until dawn - while, during the night, the shrubbery around the campsite is lit up like a Christmas tree by the glow of a thousand insects.

We travel along a clear path - but the rivers that flow across it are barriers that have not, so far, been lowered by the steady increase in tourism to the Lost City.

Every waterway has to be waded across in bare feet, with backpacks held above the head for balance. Strong currents frequently topple travellers attempting to traverse the rivers waist-deep in the wet season.

On the up: The final challenge in reaching the Lost City comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps twisting up and disappearing high into the mountainside before finally emerging at the entrance to the site

There it is at last:  The 1,200-year-old ruins of the 'Lost City' were only re-discovered in the 1970s

At one crossing, a rather ramshackle, hand-operated cable car provides meagre assistance.

The final challenge in reaching our destination comes in the form of more than 1,200 stone steps, which twist up and disappear high into the mountainside - before finally emerging at the entrance to the Lost City.

It is the same staircase that was stumbled upon by accident in the 1970s, when La Ciudad Perdida and its stone terraces were re-discovered by local hunters.

But the sheer effort required to get to this spot has ensured that, for all its beauty, the site remains free of the crowds that are bussed in to Peru’s Machu Picchu on a daily basis.

A world of wonder: The trek to La Ciudad Perdida showcases the best of Colombia’s natural beauty and wildlife

When we arrive, we have the entire site virtually to ourselves, the only sounds coming from several squawking birds in the distance. 

We are provided with breathtaking views of the horizon, which can change almost by the hour. High visibility over the Sierra Nevada mountain range can swiftly turn to rolling mist over the tree-tops.

Although Colombia has enjoyed an increase in tourism over recent years after slowing shedding its reputation for danger and violence, this reversal in fortune suffered a setback in 2003 when eight foreigners hiking to La Ciudad Perdida were kidnapped by guerrillas and held for three months.

On the way back home: Simon prepares for the long four-hour drive along the coast to Cartagena 

It was not until 2005 that the military was sent in, allowing treks to the Lost City to resume.

The route is now closely monitored by troops.

While the trek to La Ciudad Perdida offers the best of Colombia’s natural beauty and wildlife, it is the 'nearby' city of Cartagena that provides travellers with a taste of the country’s intoxicating culture.

A four-hour bus ride west along the Caribbean coast from Santa Marta take visitors to this beautiful, medieval walled city.

Old and new: Cartagena provides travellers to Colombia with a taste of the country’s intoxicating culture

The old town’s mix of energetic nightlife and vibrantly coloured  streets manages to attract tourists and backpackers, while the city’s thriving corporate district is abuzz with new investment.

It may be the Lost City that provides a glimpse back at Colombia’s history. But Cartagena is a nod to the future of this stunning South American country.

Delta (0871 2211222; www.delta.com) flies from London to Bogota via Atlanta from £860 return. Business class flights start at £2330 return.
