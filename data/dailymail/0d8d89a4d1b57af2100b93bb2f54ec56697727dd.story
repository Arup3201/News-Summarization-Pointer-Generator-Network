An emaciated pitbull puppy was allegedly left outside of a veterinary clinic in the freezing cold and no one from the clinic went to retrieve it.

Two paramedics later found the dog lying on the frigid pavement last Wednesday and brought it to an SPCA shelter wrapped in blankets.

The dog was so weak, she couldn't even raise her head, they said.

On the verge of death: This emaciated pitbull puppy was found outside of a veterinary clinic in the freezing cold

Saver: Rural-Metro paramedic Norine Hock of the Buffalo New York region found the dog lying on the frigid pavement and took it to an SPCA shelter

‘As my partner was pulling into the driveway, all of a sudden, she started going, 'Oh my God! Oh my God!'’ paramedic

Norine Hock told WIVB in Buffalo, New York. ‘It was, like, 32 degrees outside, and she was skin and bones.

‘Seconds later, she probably would have been frozen to death.’

The dog was found lying in the parking lot of the Anderson Inner City Animal Hospital.

‘A gentleman came to the door, and he said, “I know she's there. I called the SPCA. They're on their way,’” Hoch told the local news channel.

The man then slammed the door in her face, she says.

Left out in the cold: No from the Anderson Inner City Animal Hospital came to retrieve the dog

Prior case: In 2009, a malnourished cocker spaniel named Kenny lay outside the same hospital for over 24 hours before anyone at the clinic called the SPCA

Dr. Hector Anderson's clinic had been accused of refusing help for a sick animal abandoned on its doorstep on another occasion, WIVB reports.

In 2009, a malnourished cocker spaniel named Kenny lay outside the hospital for over 24 hours before anyone at the clinic called the SPCA.

Kenny was put to sleep three days later and the SPCA filed a complaint against Dr. Anderson, who runs the clinic.

The SPCA Serving Erie County is again investigating the Anderson Inner City Animal Hospital, this time for neglecting the starving pitbull puppy.

The paramedics said they planned to give their statements to investigators.

The pitbull puppy is very ‘touch-and-go,’ the SPCA said. They are keeping her warm with hot water bottles.

Vets have been doing tests to see if the dog’s internal organs are still functioning and they told WIVB that it is impossible to determine if she will survive.
