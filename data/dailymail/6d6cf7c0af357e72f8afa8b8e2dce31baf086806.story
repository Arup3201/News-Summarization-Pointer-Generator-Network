Danny Care blamed England’s lack of discipline for their fifth straight defeat to a southern hemisphere side.

Stuart Lancaster’s men lost hooker Dylan Hartley to the sin bin after 61 minutes for a cynical stamp on Duane Vermeulen’s knee while a string of breakdown penalties allowed Springbok Pat Lambie to kick nine points, as well as two conversions.

In another incident, an unidentified England player faces being cited after New Zealand referee Steve Walsh was overheard confirming dangerous play in the first half.

Citing commissioner Douglas Hunter was on Saturday night looking for television evidence which could incriminate an England player after Springbok flanker Schalk Burger was left with blood pouring from a head wound following an off-the-ball incident.

‘It was a cheap shot that caused the blood,’ Walsh was heard telling one of his touch judges. ‘It was obviously an illegal clear-out. We’ll look at it afterwards.’

Hartley cannot be cited as he received a yellow card for his stamp on Vermeulen, but Care admitted England’s indiscretions had proved costly.

‘Our discipline let us down,’ said Care, who was winning his 50th cap. ‘Perhaps it is because we were trying too hard because we so badly wanted to win.

‘I know people will write us off now but I know the self-belief there is in this side and that we will come back strong and our confidence will not be dented.’

England skipper Chris Robshaw said he and his team-mates failed to show enough aggression early on.

South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England 

‘We were a little bit reactive today,’ he said. ‘We allowed them to get ahead of us and then we were playing catch-up. We’ll have to work hard and move forward next week.

‘We didn’t start as strongly as we would’ve liked. We got back into the game, but couldn’t quite finish it.’

Meanwhile, another close encounter saw France hang on with 14 men to beat Australia 29-26. The game looked dead and buried before Remi Tales was given a yellow card for cynically killing the ball at a ruck, but while Australia managed a try to get in reach, they couldn’t quite finish the job.
