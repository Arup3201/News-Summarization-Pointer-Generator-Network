A multi-millionaire widower was today sensationally named as the father of the love child of former French justice minister Rachida Dati.

Dominique Desseigne, 68-year-old chief of the Lucien Barriere casino and hotel group, is said to have had a passionate affair with the high-profile politician in 2008.

It is claimed that it resulted in baby Zohra being born on January 2, 2009 - prompting international speculation as to who her father was.

Names put forward included former 
French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the former Spanish prime minister 
Jose Marma Aznar, as well as numerous showbusiness and sports stars.

Now the Paris magazine Le Point says 
that Ms Dati tried to injunct Mr Desseigne about going public about their
affair, and the fact that he is Zohra's father.

Asked to comment today, Mr Desseigne said: 'I have no comment to make, otherwise it will be held against me by the court.'

However, he confirmed the legal action taken against him by Ms Dati for 'recognising the paternity of the child.'

In early January, Ms Dati told Elle magazine that 'Yes, I have a man in my life,' but continued to refuse to name him.

She said she 'did not want to annoy him', and 'to keep a part of his life private'.

Ms Dati, who is a Muslim with North 
African parents, has one failed arranged marriage behind her but has 
been single since her early 20s.

Mr Sarkozy promoted her to justice 
minister in an attempt to get ethnic minorities into government, but the
appointment was considered a disaster.

The glamorous Ms Dati was regularly 
criticised for appearing in glossy magazines and at high-profile parties
rather than concentrating on her ministerial work.

Today she refused to say Le Point’s claims were ‘false’.

Mr Desseigne, who is worth more than £500 million, was a close ally of the conservative Mr Sarkozy.

Mr Sarkozy famously celebrated his election win in Fouquet's, a restaurant on the Champs Elysee which Mr Desseigne owns.

Mr Desseigne has two grown up children from his marriage to his late wife Diane Barriere-Desseigne, who died in 2001.
