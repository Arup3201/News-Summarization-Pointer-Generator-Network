South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party swept toward victory in South Africa's fifth post-apartheid election today, with early results showing that its union-favouring left wing rivals suffered heavy losses.

The
 ANC, the liberation movement that took power two decades ago under the 
leadership of Nelson Mandela, won 63.7 percent of Wednesday's vote with 
nearly two-thirds of districts counted, the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC) said.

The party's closest rival, the Democratic Alliance, was on 22.1 percent, an improvement on the 16.7 per cent 
it won five years ago. The group is gradually shedding its image as the political 
home of privileged minority whites.

President Jacob Zuma will now have the clout to push through pro-business reforms in the face of union and leftist opposition.

The party's closest rival, the Democratic Alliance, was on 22.1 percent, an improvement on the 16.7 per cent 
it won five years ago. The group is gradually shedding its image as the political 
home of privileged minority whites.

The militant EFF, launched by Malema after he was expelled from the ANC in 2012, was in third place with 4.9 percent.

Turnout
 was high across 22,000 polling stations nationwide, officials said, and
 voting passed off smoothly.

But the ANC said one of its members was
 shot dead outside a polling station in rural KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma's home
 province.

The resilience of ANC support has 
surprised analysts who a year ago were saying it could struggle at the 
polls as its glorious past recedes into history and voters focus instead
 on the sluggish economic growth and slew of scandals that have typified
 Zuma's first term.

Africa's
 most sophisticated economy has struggled to recover from a 2009 
recession - its first since the 1994 demise of apartheid - and the ANC's
 efforts to stimulate growth and tackle 25 percent unemployment have 
been hampered by powerful unions.

 Africa's top anti-graft agency accused Zuma this year of 'benefitting 
unduly' from a $23million state-funded security upgrade to his private 
home at Nkandla in rural KwaZulu-Natal province that included a swimming
 pool and chicken run.

His personal approval ratings have dipped since the findings by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.

He
 has also devoted less and less time over the last year to the wishes of
 unions, whose long walkouts have hit confidence in Africa's most 
developed economy.

There were fears that the
 Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) - led by his former protege Julius 
Malema - would ride a wave of populist anger over widespread poverty and
 unemployment, but he seems to have batted away opposition from the 
left.

'With
 this, he is much less beholden to the left,' Cape Town-based political 
analyst Nic Borain said, adding he expected Zuma to appoint a technocrat
 cabinet with the express mandate to roll out policies to boost growth.

'There's
 no deeply insightful change, but the bottom line is that by 2019 they 
are going to have to be growing this economy and making sure they can 
still raise tax revenue.'

Zuma
 hinted this week that the ANC needed to take a more pro-business tack, 
accusing the main platinum union of irresponsibility for dragging out a 
four-month wage strike, and he hinted at reforms in the pipeline.

'We
 need an overwhelming majority so that we can change certain things so 
that we can move faster,' Zuma told a news conference. 'There are things
 you need to remove so you can move faster. I won't be specific.'

One
 influential minister said the ANC would focus on policies adopted at a 
2012 leadership conference, when it rejected 'wholesale nationalisation'
 of industries and sought to quell investor concerns with 
business-friendly pronouncements.

'The
 policies of the new coming government, the principles that will provide
 the framework for the new administration, have already been set out,' 
Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba told Reuters.

'That is what we are going to implement.'

Polls
 ahead of the election, the first to feature voters born after 
apartheid, had put ANC support near 65 percent, a touch below the 65.9 
percent it won in the 2009 vote that brought Zuma to power.

The
 rand firmed as much as 1 percent against the dollar, to 10.35 - its 
strongest level this year - as the ANC's margin of victory became clear.
 The benchmark Top-40 stock index was little changed.

The
 ANC's enduring popularity has confounded those who had expected its 
support to wane as the glory of its past receded into history and voters
 focused instead on the sluggish growth and slew of scandals that have 
typified Zuma's first term.

 has denied any wrongdoing and defended the upgrades as necessary for 
the protection of a head of state. He confidently told reporters on 
Monday that the Nkandla controversy was 'not an issue with the voters.'
