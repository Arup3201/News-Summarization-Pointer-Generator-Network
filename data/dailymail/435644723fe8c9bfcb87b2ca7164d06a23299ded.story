Lawsuit: Jill Kelley from Tampa Bay, Florida, claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked information about her to the media

A Florida socialite has been told she can pursue a lawsuit which claims the government invaded her privacy during the scandal over former CIA director David Petraeus. 

Jill Kelley from Tampa Bay, Florida, received global media attention for triggering the investigation that revealed the intelligence chief was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell.

But she claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked damaging information about her to the media.

In 2012, Kelley, who has friends in military circles, complained to the bureau when an anonymous individual sent her harassing emails.

Her concerns triggered an investigation that led agents to Broadwell, who was romantically involved with the married Petraeus at the time.

However, after a search of her emails, the bureau publicly announced that she had ‘inappropriate’ email conversations with General John Allen - even though she is married.

She claims that agents deliberately leaked her name to the public and then released the correspondences  to insinuate an affair between them and smear her name.

According to NBC, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson yesterday said she can now sue the government officials in a move that could reveal more information about the scandal that unfolded two years ago. 

Court filings by her lawyers claim the government falsely told one news outlet the emails between Allen and Kelley were the equivalent of phone sex.

Mrs Kelley went into hiding as the allegations were disclosed.

She has only recently spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong.

All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley - were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship.

Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Scott at her side, fought back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen.

She served as a volunteer civilian liaison to MacDill Air Force Base, where Petreaus and his wife had been stationed when he served as head of the military's Central Command. 

Petreaus struck up a friendship with Kelley, but Broadwell feared he was having an affair with her, as well.

The married intelligence chief resigned from his position as Director of the CIA in November 2012, citing his extramarital affair.
