Comic Relief has withdrawn a £100,000 grant to an anti-stalking service headed by leading campaigner Laura Richards – who The Mail on Sunday revealed last week had accused a fellow activist of stalking her.

The dramatic development came as this newspaper learned that five frontline caseworkers at Ms Richards's not-for-profit company Paladin – National Stalking Advocacy Service, have resigned in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, leading women's safety charity the Suzy Lamplugh Trust has stopped sending stalking victims to Paladin for advice following its own 'concerns' about the organisation and its capacity.

Laura Richards, 39, (pictured) the civilian former head of Scotland Yard's controversial Homicide Prevention Unit, accused former campaign partner Harry Fletcher of stalking her 

Last week, The Mail on Sunday reported how Ms Richards, 39, had alleged to police that Harry Fletcher – a 68-year-old fellow architect of anti-stalking legislation and a co-founder of Paladin – had stalked her. He strongly denies the allegation.

Mr Fletcher, former assistant general secretary of Napo, the probation officers' union, successfully campaigned alongside Ms Richards for a change in the law on stalking in 2012, and the following year they launched Paladin. 

The new service was awarded large grants from charities, including Comic Relief, which last year pledged £148,000 over three years.

But on Friday, Comic Relief said the remainder of its funding, totalling £99,334, was being 'suspended' – an unusual step for the Red Nose Day charity, which raises millions through its annual BBC telethon and other activities.

Police have already interviewed Mr Fletcher, a former official of probation officers' union Napo, who is married with children. He strongly denies the allegations

It said: 'As a result of some issues raised by changes within the organisation that have been brought to our attention we have suspended the grant while we investigate further.'

Comic Relief said the money destined for Paladin was channelled through domestic violence charity Safer Places, of which Paladin is a subsidiary.

Ms Richards, whose salary as Paladin's chief executive is believed to be about £30,000 for a two-day week, set up the London-based organisation to deal with 'high-risk victims of stalking' in England and Wales. 

She charges up to £1,000 a day for private training work and speaking engagements with police forces and other organisations.

Paul Infield, chairman of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said yesterday: 'We have stopped referring clients to Paladin because they didn't appear to us to have capacity. We were referring people and they weren't being picked up.

'I know they lost almost all of their staff. We are concerned about what's been happening recently – the loss of their staff, some of whom were very good, does concern us.

'And the situation – to use a neutral word – between Laura and Harry – concerns everyone within the anti-stalking movement.'

Mr Fletcher resigned from Paladin in late 2013. In May 2014, Ms Richards went to police and alleged that he had stalked her – an accusation he categorically denies.

Ms Richards told The Mail on Sunday that Mr Fletcher, who is married with children, was 'obsessed' with her and stalked her when she spurned his advances. She said she felt violated as a result.

Mr Fletcher, who voluntarily made a statement to police last November, said: 'I completely and utterly deny these allegations and have fully co-operated with the police. I look forward to their inquiry reaching its conclusion.'

In a statement, Paladin said: 'The safety of our clients and the high quality of our specialist stalking service has always been of paramount importance and we are continuing to build a strong team of experienced staff and management. Our service is being independently evaluated by a leading academic institution.

'We are taking legal advice regarding allegations made against our CEO and in respect of our service. There is also an ongoing police investigation and it would not be appropriate to comment further.'
