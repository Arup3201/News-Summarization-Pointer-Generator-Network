Many families outlaw politics at the dinner table, but food is far from common ground on which Republic and and Democrats can agree.

A new study published in the Wall Street Journal has revealed which fast food joints, chain restaurants and grocery stores conservatives and liberal prefer.

Experion Marketing Services surveyed thousands of Americans across the country, asking them both their political identity and what food establishments they frequent.

Red-meat lovers: Conservatives appear to favor the traditional American food available at pub-style eatery O'Charley's, southern country kitchen Cracker Barrel and Longhorn's steakhouse

Around the world: The favorite restaurant chains of liberals were more ethnic, including Italian, Mexican and Asian cuisines

The most conservative chain restaurant: O'Charley's is a casual bar and restaurant chain with locations throughout the South and Midwest

Most liberal chain restaurant: Democrats can't resist a slice from California Pizza Kitchen

Each store included in the survey was then given a score, with the number 100 being average. A score of 120 was 20 per cent more liberal or conservative than average and scores below 100 meant it was less liberal or conservative than average.

Restaurants and supermarkets with scores far below 100 were favored more by independents.

While some of the results were surprising, like sub sandwich chain Blimpie's being a favorite of liberals, most of the results adhered strongly to regional biases.

For example, the most popular supermarket for conservatives is Randall's which is based in Texas - a strong red state.

Southern stores: The results for grocery stores was somewhat unsurprising, considering supermarkets vary regionally. However, Foodtown's inclusion in the top-five conservative stores is interesting considering the market is found mostly in blue-leaning New York and New Jersey

Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are popular stores in major metropolitan areas which tend to skew liberal. Fred Meyer is a Pacific Northwest store, while ACME is found mainly in Pennsylvania. Safeway is the second-largest grocery chain in North America

Most conservative grocery store: Right-wingers grab their groceries at Randall's, which is based mostly in Texas

Most liberal grocery store: Whole Foods grocery stores are popular in major metropolitan areas across the country, and sale mostly organic products

The favored grocery store for liberals on the other hand, is Whole Foods which is popular in major metropolitan area across the country and hubs for Democrats.

However, some of the restaurants have a noted political identity, such as Chipotle. The Mexican chain has a company ethos to use animal products that have been raised in a humane way and locally source ingredients.

Chick-fil-A has also appealed to the strongest conservatives in recent years on the topic of same-sex marriage.

Chick-fil-A is a notable conservative fast food joint, since it's COO caused controversy for making statements against gay-marriage

Chipotle has a company mission to sell locally sourced ingredients and only meat that has been humanely raised

Most conservative fast food chain: Southern favorite Krystal is famous for its slider burgers

The most liberal fast food chain: Liberals get their morning coffee and croissants on the go at Au Bon Pain

The chain's COO Dan T Cathy caused controversy when he made comments against gay marriage.

Cathy said that those who 'have the audacity to define what marriage is about' were 'inviting God's judgement on our nation'

Those statemnts caused boycotts at chains across the nation, but many die-hard conservatives countered the protests by showing up in hordes at the restaurants.Â
