A love triangle that ended with a woman poisoning her husband’s pregnant mistress has ended up in the Supreme Court after she faced a chemical weapons charge for spreading poison on the woman’s mailbox.

Carol Anne Bond of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, is being prosecuted on federal charges- because tampering with mailboxes is a federal crime- saying she violated an international chemical weapons treaty and she is challenging her conviction.

The drama started when Bond, who is unable to carry children of her own, learned that her best friend Myrlina Haynes announced that she was pregnant.

Unusual attack: Carol Anne Bond put an arsenic-like substance on the door handle and mail box of her former best friend and neighbor who had an affair with Bond's husband

But Bond later found out her husband of more than 14 years, Clifford Bond, was the father.

Bond, a laboratory technician, stole an arsenic-based chemical called 10-chloro-10H phenoxarsine from the company where she worked and purchased potassium dichromate on Amazon.com. Both can be deadly if ingested or exposed to the skin at sufficiently high levels.

Bond combined and spread the chemicals on Haynes' door handle and in the tailpipe of Haynes' car.

Haynes noticed the bright orange compound but could not get local police interested in investigating.

She called at least a dozen times, but police suggested that she take her car to a car wash and suggested that the chemicals might be cocaine.

The law was passed to fulfill the United 
States' international treaty obligations under the 1993 Convention on 
the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of 
Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

The chemical weapons law makes it 
illegal to ‘develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer directly or 
indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, possess or use, or threaten
to use, any chemical weapon.’

Justices
went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under 
the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals, including the 
use of kerosene, matches, performance-enhancing drugs used in sports, 
and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a 
fishbowl.

Bond's defense team argues that the charge she faces is an example of federal overreaching, and the court agreed with her in 2011 when it first was argued in front of the Supreme Court.

Justice Samuel Alito later drove home his point by 
saying under the law, even innocent ordinary actions could become 
questionable if the government's power is not limited.

‘Would it shock you if I told you that
a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great 
number of children?’ he said to laughter from the courtroom.

‘On
Halloween, we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so
it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons’ law.’

When Haynes found the compound on her mailbox, she complained again to police, who told her to call the United States Postal Service.

Federal investigators videotaped Bond going back and forth between Haynes' car and the mailbox with the chemicals.

Postal inspectors arrested Bond, saying that Bond tried to poison Haynes at least 24 times between 2006 and 2007.

‘The state of Pennsylvania exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue this matter,’ Bond's lawyer said.

But
a federal grand jury indicted her on two counts of possessing and using
a chemical weapon, applying a federal anti-terrorism law.

The law was passed to fulfill the United 
States' international treaty obligations under the 1993 Convention on 
the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of 
Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.

Bond pleaded guilty and was given six years in prison. This is her second time in front of the Supreme Court.

In 2011, the court unanimously sided 
with Bond to allow her to challenge her conviction despite arguments 
from federal prosecutors and judges that she should not even be allowed 
to appeal the verdict.

Lower courts subsequently rejected the appeal, leading to her current challenge.

A
couple of justices were very critical of government prosecutors for 
choosing even to prosecute Bond using the chemical weapons law.

‘If
you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for 
using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted,’ said Justice 
Samuel Alito.

‘It's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the word.’

Justice Anthony Kennedy said it ‘seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.’

The
chemical weapons law makes it illegal to ‘develop, produce, otherwise 
acquire, transfer directly or indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, 
own, possess or use, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.’

Justices
went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under 
the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals, including the 
use of kerosene, matches, performance-enhancing drugs used in sports, 
and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a 
fishbowl.

Fighting the issue: Mrs Bond hired attorney Paul Clement, seen here with Arizona governor Jan Brewer when he was arguing for her immigration law in front of the Supreme Court in 2012

Alito later drove home his point by saying under the law, even innocent ordinary actions could become questionable if the government's power is not limited.

‘Would it shock you if I told you that
a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great 
number of children?’ he said to laughter from the courtroom.

‘On
Halloween, we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so
it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons’ law.’

Bond's
lawyer, former Solicitor General Paul Clement, said the law should have
never been applied to Bond, considering that it was passed to deal with
countries.

‘With all due 
respect, I don't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals, 
attempt to commit suicide or try to get rodents out of their houses,’ 
Clement said.

And since they did apply it to her, it was an unconstitutional overreach by Congress, he said.

‘If
the statute at issue here really does reach every malicious use of 
chemicals anywhere in the nation, as the government insists, then it 
clearly exceeds Congress's limited and enumerated powers,’ Clement said.
‘This court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock principle of 
our federalist system that Congress lacks a general police power to 
criminalize conduct without regard to a jurisdictional element or some 
nexus to a matter of distinctly federal concern.’

But
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan pointed out that since the
treaty was legal, then the implementing legislation would have to be 
legal as well, a position Verrilli supported.

Highest court in the land: This is not the first time the case is being seen by the Supreme Court, and they previously ruled in Mrs Bond's favor but lower courts rejected it and sent it back to the Supreme Court

Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the federal government regulates the use of marijuana.

‘Why is it, if it's OK to regulate the possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that can kill or maim another human being?’ she said.

She also noted that federal officials have criticized Syria for that country's supposed use of chemical weapons.

Syria is believed to possess around 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin. Washington and U.S. allies accuse the Syrian government of being responsible for an August 21 chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb, while Damascus blames rebels.

‘It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria, when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional,’ Sotomayor said.

Justices are expected to make a decision before summer.
