A Las Vegas mother, her ex-husband and his new wife all faced court on Tuesday after being charged with what police described as  'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory' involving their own children.

Mother-of-four Terrie L. Sena, 43, who was arrested last week and charged with multiple counts of disturbing sexual abuse in Clark County, has been a licensed kindergarten through 12th grade substitute teacher since May 2013, according to The Las Vegas Review Journal.

Along with her ex-husband Christopher Sena, 47, and his current wife Deborah Sena, 50, the trio are accused of engaging in sex acts with at least eight minors and filming some of the encounters as part of a child porn operation.

The eight children identified as being abused were immediate and extended family members, police said.

Despite the strange relationship dynamic, all three live together in the same trailer home. 

In court on Tuesday: Christopher Sena, 47 (left) and his current wife Deborah Sena, 50 (right), are facing a total of 50 sexual abuse charges involving eight child victims over 12 years

Scene: Officers searched the Vegas trailer home of Christopher Sena, where they allege the abuse occurred

 Investigators believe there are more victims and say the sex crimes have been going on for at least 12 years.

Some of the victims are now adults, police said. 

Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997.

However Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife. 

Police found out about the alleged sex ring in September after the new wife Deborah Sena, another adult and a child told a family law attorney about the abuse.

Charged: Christopher Sena, 47,was arrested September 19 after investigators identified him as the alleged ring leader, while his current wife Deborah Sena (right) and ex Terrie Sena were arrested Thursday

Hangout: Neighbors say the home was a meeting point for alot of children in the area

Deborah Sena is said to have left her husband in August, moving out of the home where the alleged abuse occurred.

A Metro SWAT team served a search warrant on their trailer home in the 6000 block of Yellow Stone Drive, near Lake Mead Boulevard and Mount Hood Street, on September 18.

Officers found at least 30 pieces of electronic and recording equipment.

A subsequent investigation lead to the arrest of Christopher Sena, who is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse.

Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison.

Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August

Debra Sena was charged with four counts of open and gross lewdness, two counts of sex assault against a child less than 14 and two counts of incest, among other charges

Christopher Sena was charged with five counts of child abuse or neglect, four counts of incest and three counts each of sex assault against a child less than 14, sex assault and lewdness with a child less than 14

One of the seized recordings allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported.

A review of other the recordings allegedly implicated Terrie and Deborah Sena.

The pair were arrested on December 11 and together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest. 

More charges related to child pornography are expected to be laid.

All three appeared in Las Vegas Justice court Tuesday morning.

The court heard that Christopher Sana threaten to break the legs of one of his alleged victims if the child told anyone of the abuse, according to KLAS-TV.

Neighbors describe the Sena property as a meeting point for many children in the community and was often the place many of the kids would hang out.

Home: All three Sena family members lived here,  in the 6000 block of Yellow Stone Drive

Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, the neighbors said. 

The two women appeared in court on Monday before Judge Nancy Oesterle, who described their charges as 'extremely shocking and disturbing'.

'That’s putting it mildly,' Judge Oesterle said.

Both women said they cannot afford an attorney.

All three Senas have been held without bail.
