Hall of Fame defensive end David 'Deacon' Jones, pictured in 1963, died on Monday aged 74

Legendary American Football player David 'Deacon' Jones died yesterday at the age of 74.

The Hall of Fame defensive end was credited with coining the word sack for how he knocked down quarterbacks.

The Washington Redskins said that Jones died of natural causes at his home in Southern California on Monday night.

Redskins general manager Bruce Allen,
whose father, George, coached Jones with the Los Angeles Rams, said: 
'Deacon Jones was one of the greatest players in NFL history. Off the 
field, he was a true giant.

'His
passion and spirit will continue to inspire those who knew him. He was 
cherished member of the Allen family and I will always consider him my 
big brother.'

Jones was 
the leader of the Rams' Fearsome Foursome unit from 1961-71 and then 
played for San Diego for two seasons before finishing his career with 
the Redskins in 1974.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980 and made the league's 75th anniversary all-time squad.

Because sacks didn't become an official statistic until 1982, Jones' total is uncertain.

However, he was renowned as a premier pass rusher and team leader.

Jones made the Pro Bowl every year from 1964-70 and played in eight overall.

He combined with fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier and Lamar Landry on the defensive line that, at times, was unblockable.

George Allen, who coached the Fearsome Foursome, called Jones the 'greatest defensive end of modern football.'

The Allen family had Jones present George Allen for his Hall of Fame induction in 2002.

The Rams' unofficial stats show Jones with 159 1-2 sacks for them and 173 1-2 for his career.

Jones also was one of the most durable players, missing just five games in his 14 pro seasons.

A 14th-round draft pick in 1961 out of Mississippi Valley State University, which later produced Jerry Rice, Jones was the first defensive lineman with 100 solo tackles, reaching that mark in 1967.

In 2009, his number was retired before the start of an NFL football game between the St. Louis Rams and Green Bay Packers.

Most recently, he was the CEO of his own foundation, which he began in 1997.

He also made several trips to visit troops on active duty in the Middle East.
