The SFA have charged both Rangers and Mike Ashley with breaching disciplinary rules over the Newcastle owner’s involvement in the Ibrox club.

Scottish football’s governing body, concerned by issues of dual ownership, had come to an agreement with the Sports Direct billionaire to limit his influence at the fallen Glasgow giants following his initial investment back in 2012.

Ashley agreed to hold no more than 10 per cent of Rangers shares and, while that remains the case, his recent tranche of loans to the Championship club, worth £3million, came with the proviso that two of his representatives would be elected to the Ibrox board.

Derek Llambias, the former Newcastle managing director, was subsequently brought in as first a consultant before being promoted to a non-executive director’s role.

Now, following Monday’s confirmation that manager Ally McCoist has tendered his resignation, the Ibrox club have been hit by more turmoil.

SFA chief executive Stewart Regan had revealed last month that he was in talks with Ashley and his representatives, and hoped to have a face-to-face meeting to discuss his involvement.

‘We’ve been in regular dialogue with Mike Ashley’s lawyers through MASH Holdings,’ said Regan.

‘It’s still ongoing at the moment, we are still in dialogue. The next stage is to meet with Mike and his advisers and obviously get some clarification around some of the concerns we have got.

‘We have a situation in our articles which prevents dual interests in football clubs. We gave Mike Ashley the ability to have up to 10-per-cent shareholding in the club.

‘As part of that, there was a commitment there would be no management or influence at Rangers Football Club.

‘Clearly, we want to have a better understanding of his position in that regard.’

Now it seems that the SFA have felt compelled to speed up the process with the disciplinary action, with a meeting set to be heard at the end of January next year.

If found guilty, Rangers could face a range of punishments that include a censure, fine, being thrown out of the Scottish Cup, a transfer ban or even having their membership of the SFA terminated.

Ashley, meanwhile, risks a £10,000 fine if he fails to have the charges dropped. 

‘The Compliance Officer has issued the following Notices of Complaint:
