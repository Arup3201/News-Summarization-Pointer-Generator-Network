The sight of an Englishman lifting the World Cup trophy this summer was already a distant dream for many England supporters.

But now those chances have taken an even bigger hit - thanks to custom officials in China.

The country has thwarted more than 1,000 shots at glory by seizing boxes rammed full of fake trophies at a warehouse.

The 1,020 statuettes were found in the city of Yiwu, Zhejiang province, which has among the busiest export trades in the world.

Fancy a World Cup? Chinese customs officers have seized more than 1,000 fake trophies at a warehouse

Just like the real thing? The mementos found in Yiwu city were due to be exported to Libya

Golden: With a group including Uruguay and Italy, the fakes could have been England's best shot at glory

The fakes, which from afar bore a remarkable resemblance to the real thing, were due to be exported to Libya.

The General Administration of Customs of China launched a campaign in April to crack down on football-related copyright theft ahead of the tournament in June.

Brazil's World Cup is expected to make huge sums in merchandising, and China has a valuable dog in the fight: its factories have manufactured a million versions of the official armadillo mascot.

England captain Steven Gerrard will hope to lift the real thing in the summer, with the Three Lions pitted in a group containing Italy, Costa Rica and Uruguay to begin their campaign in Brazil.

Crackdown: China has valuable legitimate trade with Brazil and has made a million World Cup mascots

Lined up: The rows upon rows of identical gleaming trophies which were found in the Chinese warehouse

Iconic: The FIFA trophy on which the fakes are modelled replaced the earlier Jules Rimet Trophy in 1974

Not playing ball: Customs are on high alert around the tournament, which has the potential to see many fakes

Eye for details: The fakes contain all the past winners of the trophy on the base - although it was West Germany which won the 1974 edition

Taking a shine: A custom official measures a fake trophy

The real thing: Brazil legend Pele kisses the official trophy
