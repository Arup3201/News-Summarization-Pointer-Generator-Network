The Arab Spring revolutions across the Middle East already have seen ragtag movements take on some of the region's most feared authoritarian regimes.

In Libya, rebels against dictator Colonel Gaddafi fought running skirmishes in the open desert using makeshift weapons that could have come straight from Mad Max.

In Syria, civilians stood up against tanks and heavily armed soldiers with little more than Molotov cocktails.

In Bahrain, hundreds were made martyrs as they stood their ground at a roundabout as the full force of the regime's Saudi-backed military cut them down.

Now, in Egypt, where violence is once again reaching a crescendo, protesters are protecting themselves with whatever they can find as they fight fierce street battles with the militarised police of the interior ministry.

Thousands of protesters remain massed 
in Cairo's iconic Tahrir Square, which is once again at the heart of the
revolt against a military regime that Egyptians say must go.

Protests
demanding that the military rulers step down have spiralled into a week
of violence as Egyptian police battled with demonstrators, blanketing 
the area around the square with tear gas and leaving at least 40 people dead.

In response, demonstrators are protecting themselves with whatever makeshift armour and gas protection they can, from scarves, goggles, and egg boxes to gas masks and pieces of scrap metal, as they continue to confront riot police in Cairo and other cities across Egypt.

Concerns
have been raised that the authorities, said to be running short of CS 
tear gas, have been using other, more potent crowd control gases - or 
perhaps even nerve agents. Reports from Egypt describe those inhaling 
the gases collapsing with convulsions, screaming with agony from the 
effects.

One activist, Ahmed Salah, told the 
Guardian that he was still coughing up blood 15 hours after being 
exposed, despite wearing a gas mask. 'People have seen three different 
kinds of canisters,' he said. 'Most are marked CS, but some have seen 
canisters marked with the letters CR and there is a third canister that 
has no markings at all.'

Unlike CS gas, which is commonly used
by police and military forces across the world, CR has been said to 
cause deaths in the past, and there is evidence that it may be 
carcinogenic.

The U.S.
military no longer uses the gas, but the canisters fired at 
demonstrators in Egypt are nonetheless sourced from American suppliers, 
stoking enmity towards the Egyptian regime's superpower ally.

The fighting across cities in Egypt has now cast doubt over the ability of the country's ruling junta to hold the first parliamentary elections since the toppling of despot Hosni Mubarak on February 11.

Egypt's military council, which has promised to start parliamentary elections as scheduled on Monday, said it was doing all it could to prevent the repetition of violence.

A ruling council member, Major General Mamdouh Shaheen, told a news conference there would be no delay to the parliamentary vote, scheduled for Monday.

But as the rain began in the Tahrir this afternoon, protesters continued to demand a transfer of power away from the military before elections can take place.

The military council has rejected demands that it stand down saying that doing so would amount to a 'betrayal' of the people's trust and arguing that the military took over from ousted president Hosni Mubarak by popular demand.

'Let me just say this: There will be no postponement in the election,' said Major General Shaheen, one of two members of the ruling military council who spoke during a televised news conference.

'The elections will be held on time with all of its three stages held on schedule.'

Earlier today, police and protesters agreed to a truce negotiated by Muslim clerics. Another council member, Major General Mukhtar el-Mallah, added that Egyptians must 'focus' on the elections, rather than street protests.

Major General El-Mallah insisted the military's immediate resignation would amount to a 'betrayal of the trust placed in our hands by the people.' He later said the throngs in Tahrir did not represent the whole of Egypt.

'We will not relinquish power because of a slogan-chanting crowd,' he said 'Being in power is not a blessing. It is a curse. It's a very heavy responsibility.'
