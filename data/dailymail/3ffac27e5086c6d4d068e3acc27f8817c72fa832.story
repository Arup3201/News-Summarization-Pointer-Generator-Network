A senior Lib Dem who promoted two girlfriends in succession to £7,500-a-year council roles has been condemned as a ‘liar and cheat’ by the first.

Keith House, 49, who earns almost £90,000 in public money every year, is said to have caused a major rift on the council by dumping one female councillor and striking up a relationship with another one seven years her junior.

The first councillor is now said to be refusing to attend meetings and failing to monitor constituents’ emails, despite her generous taxpayer-funded allowance.

She has also attacked council leader Mr House for taking her ‘replacement’ on romantic holidays.

Mr House dumped Louise Bloom, 50, his girlfriend of 14 years, on election night in May, leaving the divorcee in tears at the count. He then struck up a relationship with married councillor Tonia Craig, 43.

Mrs Craig, who is separated from her husband, was then rapidly promoted to join Miss Bloom in Mr House’s eight-strong ‘cabinet’ at Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire in June. Its members decide council policy and are paid an extra allowance of £7,500 a year.

But Miss Bloom is apparently so upset by the break-up that she has not attended any of the five cabinet meetings held since.

Sources say she feels unable to ‘play gooseberry’ to her ex-partner and his girlfriend. But she still draws her allowance.

Meanwhile Mr House has neglected to declare formally his new relationship with Mrs Craig.

Miss Bloom is said to have been furious last month when Mr House took Mrs Craig on holiday to the US and Canada and posted pictures online.

One featured Mrs Craig at Niagara Falls, and another showed the pair knocking on doors for Democratic Party campaigners in America. Miss Bloom wrote on Twitter: ‘Ex seems to be taking my replacement to all the places we went to. Should I send him a list to help? #LiarandCheat.’

She told a friend: ‘I was in tears when Keith dumped me on polling night in May – and was upset again when I saw on Facebook that she was touring America with him at his expense.’

Mrs Craig, meanwhile, announced the end of her relationship with husband Gordon on Facebook on April 7.

Mr House has told locals he is ‘just good friends’ with Mrs Craig, but Mr Craig, 46, said she had been entirely open about Mr House being her new partner. Mr Craig, an asset manager, said he had left his wife in 2013, adding: ‘Tonia’s relationship with Keith House started some time after I left the family house.’

As well as being leader of the borough council, Mr House – a divorced father of four – holds a number of other public roles including leader of the opposition on the county authority.

Mr House, Miss Bloom and Mrs Craig had last night not responded to repeated detailed requests for comment.

Eastleigh Borough Council said it would not comment ‘on a private matter’.
