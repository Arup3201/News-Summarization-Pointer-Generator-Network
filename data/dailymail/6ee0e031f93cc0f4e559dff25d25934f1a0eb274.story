A two-year-old girl has died after being crushed between two shuttle buses at a pumpkin-picking festival.

Ella Fuehring was standing in front of a bus in a parking field with her mother, six-year-old brother, and friends when another vehicle plowed into them.

The toddler was killed instantly in the collision at Alstede Farm, Chester, New Jersey, which was witnessed by hundreds of festival-goers as the event came to a close on Sunday at 4.40pm.

Grieving: Sarah  Fuehring (seen here with a friend) and her husband Kenneth are devastated by the tragic loss of their daughter

Her mother Sarah Fuehring was left with a fractured thigh bone and her mother's friend Joanna Alemany shattered her pelvis. 

Speaking from her hospital bed, Mrs Alemany described the horrific incident.

'We were pinned between the vehicles. There was no collision,' Alemany told the Daily Record.

'It crushed Sarah's femur and it crushed my pelvis. We saw it was crowded and we didn't get to enjoy anything, so we were leaving.

'Then Sarah and I were laying on the ground together. We couldn't move. We were reaching to each other but couldn't reach each other.

'I cannot close my eyes without seeing it happen again and again. I keep seeing Sarah's face when she realized. My heart is so broken.' 

In a statement, Alstede Farms said: 'The Alstede family and staff grieve and mourn for the families impacted by the motor vehicle accident that occurred on Sunday October 12, 2014. Our sincere prayers and heartfelt thoughts are extended to everyone involved.

Tributes: Hundreds of people have donated more than $26,000 since Sunday for Ella's funeral costs

'We are unable to make further comments while the accident is under an ongoing investigation by the Morris County Prosecutor's Office.'

Friends have now set up a fundraising site to gather money for Ella's funeral.

It received more than $12,000 in less than 24 hours, and the total has now surpassed $26,000.

'Elizabeth was taken from us far sooner than she should have been,' the site said. 

Horrific: Hundreds of people witnessed the crash at 4.40pm on Sunday which killed Ella instantly

'At just 2 1/2 years old, Ella was enjoying a day out at the farm when tragedy struck and she was hit by a shuttle bus along with her mother and a few friends. 

'She passed instantly and her mother, Sarah Fuehring, was rushed into surgery with a broken femur. 

'The Fuehring family is heartbroken and doesn't need the extra burden of scraping together funds for funeral expenses. 

'Any donation is greatly appreciated. Please help us give Elizabeth the funeral she deserves.'
