The family of former New York  Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard has filed a lawsuit against the National Hockey League, charging that it is responsible for his 2011 death.

Boogaard, who played six seasons in the league, was found dead on May 13, 2011 after accidentally overdosing on prescription painkillers and alcohol. He was 28 years old.

After his death, he was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease caused by repeated blows to the head.

The NHL forward, who also played for the Minnesota Wild, was placed on a path to destruction by the league, his surviving family members claim in the lawsuit.

The Boogaards' lawyer, William Gibbs, told The New York Times: 'To distill this to one sentence, you take a young man, you subject him to trauma, you give him pills for that trauma, he becomes addicted to those pills, you promise to treat him for that addiction, and you fail.'

NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told The Associated Press in an email Sunday night that league has not received the lawsuit and generally does not comment on pending litigation.

The Times reports the suit was filed 
late Friday by the Chicago law firm of Corboy & Demetrio, in the 
Circuit Court of Cook County.

Boogaard was under contract with the New York Rangers at the time of his death.

He played his first five NHL seasons 
with the Minnesota Wild and one season with the Rangers after signing a 
four-year, $6.5million contract with New York in July 2010.

Derek Boogaard was found to have suffered from the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy after his death.

Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions.

Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or even decades later.

It can eventually cause dementia.

In recent years a number of sportsmen's suicides have been linked to the condition, including hockey player Wade Belak, and football stars Dave Duerson and Ray Easterling.

It can only be diagnosed after death when the brain can be properly examined.

Boogaard's brain was one of 50 donated to Boston University’s Center for the Study of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

Boogaard sustained a concussion during his last game on December 9, 2010.

Known as one of the league's toughest fighters, the 6-foot-7, 255-pound Boogaard played 277 NHL games, scored three goals and racked up 589 penalty minutes.

Boogaard's family filed a lawsuit against the NHL Players Association last September, seeking $9.8million, but it was dismissed this spring.

The family said the union, after expressing interest in helping pursue a case against the league, missed a deadline for filing a grievance.

A judge ruled the family waited too long to act and dismissed the case.

The Times reports the family used a different lawyer in that case.

The Times reports the latest lawsuit details the treatment Boogaard received from team doctors of the Rangers and Minnesota Wild, and the officials from the league's Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program, which oversaw Boogaard's care after he entered rehabilitation while playing for the Wild in 2009.

CTE has also been linked to the death of former Nashville Predator Wade Belak, who committed suicide in a Toronto hotel room in 2011, four months after Boogaard.

That same year, Winnipeg Jets rising star Rick Rypien was killed himself after a battle with depression.
