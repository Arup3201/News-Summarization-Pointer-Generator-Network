A great grandfather celebrated scooping a £500,000 Lottery prize just days before his 80th birthday by taking aim at his wife with a bottle of bubbly.

Retired builder Denis Wheat, 79, showered his wife Barbara, 76, in champagne today as he revealed that he hopes to buy a new car with his big winnings.

He said he also wants to buy gifts for their three children, eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren.

Time to celebrate: But Mr Wheat couldn't control the champagne bottle that bubbled out of control as he pointed it at his wife

Oh dear: Mrs Wheat gets a soaking! The couple have three children, eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren to spend the money on

Mr Wheat, from Warrington, Cheshire, 
who has been playing The National Lottery since it started and has had a
few small wins on the Lotto, said he couldn't believe it when he matched 
five numbers plus the Thunderball in the draw on Saturday.

He said: 'I just shouted out to 
Barbara I have got one number, I've got two numbers, three, four, five …
and the Thunderball. I just could not believe it. I was shaking!

'I was checking my numbers on the 
television and I had to look about four times - I could not believe what
I was seeing! As I was matching the numbers my voice was just getting 
more and more high-pitched and louder and louder and then I just burst 
into tears.'

Mr Wheat always keeps the same 
numbers - the birth dates of family members - and plays Lotto and 
Thunderball every Wednesday and Saturday. He said his win won't stop him
trying his luck.

The former bridge toll operator, from Lymm, said: 'I won't let the money change me; I don't want a Mercedes or anything'

Mr Wheat, who previously worked on Warburton Toll Bridge in Lymm, used the birth dates of family members as his lucky numbers

'I certainly won't be stopping 
playing now and I think I will also be getting a ticket for EuroMillions
this Friday as I've got a chance of winning £1million every month for a
year,' Denis said.

The news is still sinking in for the 
couple who have been married for 57 years - Mr Wheat previously worked 
on Warburton Toll Bridge in Lymm, Cheshire, and his wife used to work in
the local fish and chip shop.

Mr Wheat added: 'Everything is still 
sinking in. A new car will be the first thing we will buy and I guess 
Barbara will also have a few ideas about how she would like to spend the
money.'

Mr Wheat, who bought his ticket from Premier Stores in Higher Lane, Lymm, matched: 5, 7, 21, 29, 31 plus the Thunderball, 7.

The estimated jackpot for tonight's Lotto draw is £6million.
