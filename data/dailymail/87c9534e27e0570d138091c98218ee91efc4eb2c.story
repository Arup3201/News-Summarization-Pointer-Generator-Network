David Cameron has called for allegations of sexual abuse against Sir Jimmy Savile to be fully investigated.

The Prime Minister told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that the claims from a number of women in recent weeks that they had been abused by the former DJ were 'truly shocking'.

And he added that the allegations should be looked into by the BBC - which employed Savile at the time - and, if necessary, the police.

Call: David Cameron told the BBC's Andrew Marr show yesterday that the allegations against Sir Jimmy Savile should be fully investigated

Mr Cameron told the programme:  'I think it is pretty shocking, 
the allegations that we are reading. They need to be properly looked at,
properly investigated.

'It seems to me it is very important that the organisation, the BBC, does that itself.

'But
also, if there are questions that should be pursued by the police and 
other organisations, everyone has to ask themselves the question "Is 
there new evidence that needs to be looked at? Are there new things as 
an organisation we should look at and examine?"

'But from what I have read - and that is just as a consumer of the media - truly shocking things have been said.'

Mr Cameron's call came as a footpath named in honour of Savile only last month was stripped of its connection with his tarnished memory yesterday.

Workmen moved in yesterday morning to 
remove the two cliff-top signs directing visitors to Scarborough 
seafront along Savile’s View near the disgraced star’s former flat on 
the Esplanade.

Police kept a close eye on the footpath after the plaque outside Savile's former home was vandalised

Police had 
stepped up patrols around the footpath leading down to the resort’s Spa 
Bridge following a vandal attack on the gold coloured 'bling' plaque 
outside Savile’s former home.

The plaque which was daubed with the 
words “rapist” and “paedophile” has also been taken down after Savile’s 
former neighbours threatened to take a sledgehammer to it.

Security has also been tightened 
around Savile’s £4,000 memorial in the Scarborough cemetery amid fears 
the grave will be the next target.

The previously unnamed path that Savile used regularly on his jogs around the town was renamed only a couple of weeks ago.

When the allegations became public, 
the resort’s Jimmy Savile Memorial Committee set up to honour his name 
was bullish that the star’s reputation would ride out the storm.

But
growing public anger has forced the committee to back-peddle and a 
sister project of raising thousands of pounds to create a life sized 
statue of Savile has also been scrapped.

Welcoming the decision to dismantle 
Savile’s View, Scarborough Councillor Nick Brown said: 'To keep the 
signs up would have been an insult to these ladies coming forward with 
these allegations.

'Whether living or dead the finger 
should be pointed at someone if they are guilty. We just hope the 
investigation by the Metropolitan Police gets to the bottom of 
everything.'
