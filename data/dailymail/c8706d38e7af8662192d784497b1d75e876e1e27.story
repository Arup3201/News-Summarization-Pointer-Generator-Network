The lawyer representing three of the men charged with the brutal gang rape and murder of a young Indian woman on a bus in New Delhi has blamed the victims for the assault.

Manohar Lal Sharma said in an interview outside the Supreme Court in the capital he had never heard of a 'respected lady' being raped in India.

He told a reporter: 'Until today I have not seen a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady.

'Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect.'

A state police van believed to be carrying the accused leaves court in New Delhi on Monday. The lawyer for three of the accused has blamed the young Indian woman and her male friend for the brutal attack, saying they shouldn't have been out late at night

Mr Sharma went on to blame the 23-year-old 's male friend, named as Awindra 
Pandey, 28, who was also attacked while travelling on a bus after the pair had been to the cinema together.

He said Mr Pandey was 'wholly responsible' for the incident as the unmarried couple should not have been on the streets at night.

He added to Bloomberg his three clients will plead not guilty to all charges when they make their next court appearance.

The news comes after the father of the murdered woman has described her desperate battle for life - and his futile hope that she would live.

Badri Singh said that although he knew that his daughter was 'in a bad state' after she was attacked by six men in Delhi last month, he still believed she might recover after she was taken to hospital in Singapore.

But the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was to die after sustaining horrific injuries during the assault.

Speaking to ITV1's Daybreak, Mr Singh said: 'When we went to Singapore she was not conscious but she had tears in her eyes. Then I realised she was in a really bad state.

Outspoken: Mr Singh spoke to ITV1's Daybreak show in India this morning. He said that he hopes his daughter's death will 'awaken' the country

'I couldn’t think what to do at that time, I was like a bird without wings, I was neither here nor there.

'So
when I thought she might get better, I used to get filled with some 
hope. When I was told that she might not get well and might have to have
an operation I felt uncomfortable.

'It
was difficult for me, but when she was put on a ventilator it gave me 
some hope that she would get better. I thought she might get better and 
she would live.'

Mr Singh 
said that his daughter's death 13 days after the horrific attack has 
'brought an awakening' to Indian society and called for his country to 
no longer turn a blind eye to attacks on women.

He added that he would like to see a new law or a hospital named after his daughter.

Describing
his daughter, Mr Singh said: 'When she was born my aunties and uncles 
always used to carry her around, those were really lovely days.

'Right
from the start her ambition was to be a doctor. Her main aim was that 
our family wouldn’t have to suffer any more, she wanted to put the 
difficult life behind us, wipe out our poverty.

'She also wanted to make sure I didn’t have to keep working hard late in life.'

The young student was attacked on an illegal bus in Delhi on December 16 and her and a male friend were left for dead on the road.

She eventually died in a hospital in Singapore after having 90 per cent of her intestines removed.

Her death sparked anger across India.

Protest: The student's death sparked outrage in India with many taking to the New Delhi streets to demand better protection for women

Anger: Protestors had given the victim the name Damini after a Bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal. She was identified when her father decided to break his silence and speak out

Lawyers said yesterday that three of the men accused of raping and murdering the 23-year-old student are to plead not guilty.

Manohar
Lal Sharma, who is representing Mukesh Singh, Ashkay Thakur and Ram 
Singh, told the Guardian that his clients will deny the charges because 
'nothing has been proven.'

All five men accused of the crime will appear at a closed court next week with the case expected to be fast-tracked to trial.

Mr
Sharma said that he would contest Indian police's handling of evidence 
after prosecutors claimed to have forensic evidence which links the men 
to the attack.

A 17-year-old who is also accused of the woman's rape and murder will appear at a youth court separately.

Meanwhile,
the victim's companion on the night of the attack, 28-year-old software
engineer Awindra Pandey, has spoken out about the terrible ordeal and his friend's horrific injuries.

He
told The Times that his efforts to flag down help from passing 
motorists after the pair had been dumped in the road were ignored for 20
minutes.

Mr Pandey said that police were reluctant to help his friend despite her injuries.

'She was asking for water and complaining of pain in her stomach,' he said.

'She was bleeding heavily. They (the police) asked me to put her in the van.'

He said that the pair, who were not dating, had been to a cinema in the city to see Life of Pi but were unable to persuade a rickshaw driver to take them all the way back to the Dwarka suburb where the woman lived with her parents.

They were dropped halfway home, when a phone call from her mother asking her to hurry home prompted them to board an illegal bus with blacked out windows.

Mr Pandey confronted other passengers when they began insulting the pair but they soon produced iron rods, he said.

He said that he was beaten and fell to the floor of the bus.

After up to 20 minutes, the gang believed the student to have died and dumped the pair in the road.
