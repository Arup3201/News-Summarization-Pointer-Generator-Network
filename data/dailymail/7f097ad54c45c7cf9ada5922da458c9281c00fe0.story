Cristiam Ramos is a breath of fresh air to the artworld. Minty fresh air that is.

The quirky artist has immortalised celebrities in iconic portraits using nothing but toothpaste.

The paintings of the stars - including Robin Williams, Emma Watson, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Sir Elton John - are crafted with various brands of the household item.

Each artwork takes the artist up to 200 hours to create and can use  as much as 30 tubes of toothpaste.

Emma Watson is one of the British celebrities that the talented artist chose to depict in toothpaste

Ramos, who lives in Orlando, Florida, said: 'It is very difficult to make these as the toothpaste becomes very sticky and dries quickly.

'The smell can also be quite overwhelming, which was challenging during the long days of up to 10 hours painting.'

Ramos, who is originally from Mexico and started painting aged just five, has produced a host of unusual artworks during his career including ones made from sweets and recycled cans.

He added: 'Depending on the size of the artwork, I will use anywhere between 20 and 30 tubes of toothpaste.

'I begin by finger painting the first layer and then let it dry.

'Then I throw on the next layer to begin giving it the tones required as toothpaste can almost be transparent.

'I keep applying coats until I get the tone I want, sometimes I have to use brushes to the smallest details.'

Ramos said: 'I thought it would be the best way to honour a man who gave his life to make us laugh.

'That's why I wanted to do the works in toothpaste as this is associated with your best smile, and that was what he gave us - laughter and smiles.'

The other celebrity artworks will be exhibited in different galleries across Florida, Hollywood and New York.
