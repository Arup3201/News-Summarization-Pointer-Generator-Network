'Dream job': Megan Cox, 22, had her position as an Emirates Airlines air hostess taken away in light of her medical history

A British woman had her dream job as an air hostess snatched away after her would-be employers realised she used to suffer from depression.

Megan Cox, 22, was offered a post with Emirates Airlines last month, and was so set on her life in the skies that she immediately turned down other job opportunities.

But this week she had the job offer snatched from her grasp in light of a medical form the company asked her to complete - which revealed that she used to have depression.

Miss Cox, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2012, sent a message from her doctor explaining that she had recovered and that there was no reason to be concerned.

However, the Dubai-based company withdrew the job offer regardless. Because air hostesses travel across the world for their job, it is not always clear whether they are covered by UK employment law.

Miss Cox, of Bridgwater, Somerset, launched a protest page on Facebook called Emirates Against Depression, describing her situation.

She wrote: 'In April I
 was offered my dream job with Emirates after the incredibly tough open 
day and final interview.

'One week after I was offered the job as a cabin crew member, I was given a 
ridiculous medical... As
 part of the medical, I needed to agree for Emirates to view all of my 
medical history.

Miss Cox said that filling out the medical form was the final stage in a costly application process that cost her more than £1,000 on fees, administration, travel vaccines and transport.

She said: 'I spent over £1,000 during the recruitment process, on necessary 
vaccinations, travel, transport and £50 for my doctor's medical 
assessment.

'I have suffered twice with depression, once in 2009 and again in 2012, after horrific and traumatic events happened in my life.

'My doctor explained that I had recovered and was no longer on any medication and my depression was caused because of events, and was not a pre-existing condition.

Megan said: 'I feel completely discriminated against. I was given every indication that I was going to get the job and to have it snatched away from me like this because of something in the past is so cruel.

'I didn't receive any further feedback about why I had been rejected by Emirates. I don't want anyone else to go through this situation.

'I am only human and I had medication to help me sleep and with my emotions, during a very difficult time in my life.

'Wanted to scream': Miss Cox wrote online of her shock at the withdrawn job, and said Emirates had lost out on the 'perfect' air hostess

'I think it is terrible I have been discriminated against because of this and I want to help others look out for this'.

However, Miss Cox later took Emirates to task for their rejection, which she said had only increased her determination.

'I read horror stories online about them rejecting 
people. And today
 I received one paragraph stating that my contract has been withdrawn 
due to this reason. 

'I was hysterical and 
wanted to scream. It's heartbreaking losing your dream job.

'But good 
riddance, Emirates. I'm a human being, who has been through hell and back
 during certain times of my life. I've needed to take a few pills to 
help me sleep and bring my mood up.

'Depression made me a stronger, 
healthier person and opened my eyes to the world. It's given me life 
experience that you couldn't comprehend... I would have been 
the perfect air hostess.

Turnaround: Dubai-based Emirates airlines withdrew their job offer after receiving the medical form

'Fair': Dubai-based Emirates Airlines insisted its processes were fair

'Emirates,
 you've just lost one of your strongest, hard-working potential 
employees who would have contributed to your company substantially... You will not bring me down. You've just made me even stronger.'

Since the rejection Megan has taken up an admin job at Exeter 
Hospital, and says she is better off not working for Emirates.

She said: 'I'm not where I want to be, but now I know what
 the company are like, I'm better off not working for them'.

Depression is an illness which causes a person to feel
persistently sad for weeks or months at a time.

It can also cause feelings of hopelessness, a loss of interest in life and physical symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite and libido, and aches and pains.

Depression can vary in severity - in mild cases it may cause
a person to feel persistently low, while in its most severe form it can cause
people to feel suicidal and as though life if not worth living.

The condition can affect up to one in six people, although some experts estimate it affects one in four at some
time in their life – and is thought to be more common in women.

There is sometimes a trigger for depression - such as
bereavement - but it can also occur for no obvious reason.

Treatment options include talking therapies and
anti-depressant medications.

Depression sufferers can also benefit from eating healthily,
exercising and reducing alcohol consumption.

Campaigners last night insisted that having a history of mental health is no reason to be rejected for a job.

Marjorie Wallace, the head of mental health charity SANE, said: 'People can recover from depression as they do from any physical illness or injury, therefore it is wrong that they should be discriminated against and considered unfit to work.

'It is estimated that one in four people will experience an episode of depression or similar mental health condition, the vast majority of whom continue to work effectively'.

And spokesman for the Time to Change mental health campaigner told  The Independent: 'One in four people experience mental health problems in any year but this doesn’t mean they can’t work and do just as good a job as anyone else'.

According to legal experts, withdrawing a job offer on the grounds of past depression can be illegal - provided the court judges the condition to be a 'disability'.

Juliette Franklin, an employment solicitor at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: ‘In the UK employees who have suffered from health issues in the past 
may be protected from discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, if 
those health issues meet the test of “disability” under the Act.’

However, Emirates is not a UK-based company and it is legally contentious whether staff such as air hostesses who work all over the world are covered by UK employment law.

When confronted about Miss Cox's case, Emirates insisted that its processes were 'fair' but than being part of the cabin crew is a 'demanding' job.

A spokesman said: 'Emirates has a clear and fair recruitment process and is an equal opportunity employer... All applications are reviewed closely... for this extremely demanding role. We are unable to comment on individual recruitment cases'.
