Soldiers baton-charged demonstrators in Cairo's Tahrir Square today just 24 hours after street clashes killed eight people and wounded more than 300.

Protesters fled into side streets to escape the troops in riot gear, who grabbed people and battered them repeatedly even after they had been beaten to the ground.

The violence - witnessed by a Reuters journalist -  marred the first free election most Egyptians can remember and highlighted the tensions in Egypt 10 months after a popular revolt toppled President Hosni Mubarak.

Shots were fired in the air and television footage showed soldiers pulling down protester tents and setting them on fire.   

The army assault followed skirmishes between protesters some of them had been throwing stones near fire brigade vehicles trying to douse a burning building.

Army-appointed prime minister, Kamal al-Ganzouri, blamed the violence on the crowds, accusing them of attacking the cabinet and parliament buildings which had to be defended by security forces. 

He confirmed the death and injury toll in which one of those killed was a respected Muslim religious scholar, Emad Effat.

Ganzouri claimed 30 security guards were injured and 18 people had gunshot wounds, as soldiers tried to end the three-week sit-in outside the parliament building.                               

Inside officials counted votes there from the second round of the country's free parliamentary
 elections.

Rescue: Activists carry an injured comrade during clashes with the army

Social
 networks played a massive part in bringing down President Mubarak in 
the first revolution and  a series of images were posted online by 
bloggers wanting to bring the world's attention to the brutality on the 
streets.

One activist
 posted a photo on Twitter of a female protester beaten in the 
skirmishes, another on Yfrog showed a man's head totally covered in 
blood - while an AP photographer captured a soldier viciously beating a 
prostrate woman in a burka.

Up to 50 protesters were believed to be injured and it's not known how many more are in police custody.

Friday's clashes pitted thousands of 
demonstrators against soldiers and plainclothes men who were seen at one
 point hurling rocks from the roof of a parliament building.   

Leading
 reform figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei took to 
Twitter to condemn the violence, writing, 'If the sit-in broke the law, 
isn't the cruelty and brutality used to break it up a greater violation 
of all human rights laws? This is not how nations are managed.'

Rocky road: Egyptian army soldiers and protesters lob anything they can find at each other

Rights groups and activists claim 
that the military, which was given temporary power after Mubarak was ousted, is carrying on the practices of the old regime, 
including arresting and beating dissidents.

Protesters at the Cabinet building 
said the clashes began last night after soldiers severely beat a young 
man who was taking part in the sit-in.

Witnesses
 accused military police of snatching the man and 
beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters.

When shocking online video and photos emerged showing people carrying the man, hundreds of people rushed to join the protest - some throwing rocks and firebombs at military police.

The pictures showed his face and eyes bruised and swollen, his head wrapped in gauze, and blood dripping from his nose.

Activist Hussein Hammouda said the 
military countered by throwing rocks and pieces of glass, and aiming 
water cannon from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building.

'Tensions between the people and 
security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just blows 
up. There is no trust between the two sides,' said Mr Hammouda, who 
resigned from the police in 2005 to protest against their practices.

Egypt's state news agency said at 
least four wounded people were taken to a nearby hospital and that a 
fire had broken out in a nearby government building as a result of the 
clashes.

Dissatisfied with the military's 
handling of Egypt's transition, protesters chanted 'Down with 
military rule' and 'The people want the execution of the Field Marshal,'
 referring to Defence Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military 
council.

Protester
 Mostafa  Sheshtawy said: t's
 pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at protesters from 
the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says democracy is 
the power of the people.'

The continued unrest since Mubarak's
 departure has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for
 the instability. Today's clashes overshadowed a nationwide campaign to 
urge Egyptians to buy locally-made goods.

Despite
 the protests, the military retains widespread support among many 
Egyptians who see it as the only entity able to run the country until 
presidential elections scheduled for next year.

Images
 of troops protecting polling centres and soldiers carrying the elderly 
to the polls have served to boost the military's image as guardians of 
the country.
