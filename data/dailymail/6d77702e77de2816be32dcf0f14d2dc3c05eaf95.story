When it comes to planning for future happiness, Americans should hedge their bets and head west for Utah.

The state has emerged top of the most 'forward-looking' regions in the U.S., after a study found its citizens to be the most satisfied with their quality of life.  

A Gallup study analyzed where would be the best place to live in America in the coming five 
years based on 13 factors including clean water, safe places to exercise
and how well you are treated by your boss.

John Denver called West Virginia 'almost heaven' but the country roads appear to have lost their luster. The research also revealed the Mountain State was the least desirable place to live in the U.S., with Mississippi and Kentucky close behind.

State of mind: The top ten states to live in the future are marked out in green - with Utah leading the way - while those which polled as most undesirable are in red

One to watch: Salt Lake City, Utah, with the snow-peaked Wasatch Mountains in the distance, is set to be the best place to live in the U.S.

The findings were based on interviews with half a million Americans between January 2011 and June of this year.

Much of the American South rated poorly 
when it came to quality of life with greater health problems, more smokers and higher levels of obesity.

Utah, Minnesota and Colorado were the 
top three places to live with much of the Midwest and the tropical 
paradise of Hawaii listed among desirable destinations.

Utah comes out on top because of its clean living reputation - likely due to the state's high Mormon population.

It has the lowest number of smokers and clean and safe drinking water is easily accessible.

Supervisors in the state treat 
workers like a partner rather than a boss giving them a greater sense of
self-worth, lower stress levels and higher job satisfaction.

The
residents of Utah who were surveyed also held the opinion that things 
were generally 'getting better' rather than 'getting worse'.

Gallup used 13 factors 
to gauge a state's livability - including the economy, job prospects and
personal finances along with 
quality-of-life components like obesity rates, smoking and how many 
trips residents made to the dentist.

West Virginia suffers from lack of 
full-time employment opportunities and also scored the second-lowest 
median household income of $38,218.

The state ranked eighth in the country when it came to people living below the poverty line, at 17.62 per cent.

State of the union: 13 factors were used to determine which were the best places to live in the U.S.

Badlands: High unemployment and poor health has made West Virginia the worst state to live in the United States, according to a Gallup study

The Mountain State was also the 
unhealthiest, with the greatest number of smokers. A quarter
of West Virginians smoked in 
2011. Obesity levels were also the highest in the U.S. at 35.3 per cent.

For Mississippi, the second worst place to live, the greatest concern was employment prospects for residents.

The state had the lowest percentage of people employed full-time and the 
lowest median income in the country at $36,851 - less than three-quarters of the 
national average of $50,046.

The best and worst states were based on findings of 530,000 interviews from 2011. Americans were asked about:

Full-time employment for an employer: 'Good jobs' were linked to higher GDP and improved wellbeing. Regions that can create these jobs and attract talent to fill them will be best positioned for economic growth.

Economic confidence index: Optimism is higher if residents were more assured about where the economy is headed.

Job creation index: Where there is more hiring than firing in the workplace, the economy grows and citizens were happier.

Supervisor relationship: Being partnered with rather than bossed around at work, lays a foundation for improved productivity, as well as improved emotional and physical health.

Standard of living optimism: Where people are more likely to say things are getting better, there is often higher economic confidence.

City optimism: Linked to lower unemployment, better environmental quality and greater satisfaction with the community.

Daily learning: Bettering residents on a daily basis is a critical psychological need.

Easy access to clean, safe water: Essential for human survival, safe water is closely linked to the physical environment and wellbeing.

Easy access to a safe place to exercise: Means lower obesity and related chronic conditions, as well as lower crime rates.

Obesity: Where there are more obese people, there are higher mortality rates, more chronic conditions and higher healthcare costs.

Smoking: Means higher mortality rates, substantially higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancers. 

Dentist visits: While no longer linked to future heart attack and stroke, poor oral health has been associated with periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, preterm deaths, and erectile dysfunction.

Future life evaluation: Where residents are optimistic about their life in five years, there is more optimism.

It also has the highest percentage of the population living below the poverty line and has the second-highest rate of obesity and the fifth-highest 
percentage of smokers.

The state also had the lowest number of residents visiting the dentist last year which is related to a plethora of health problems.

The state of Kentucky's median income - $40,062 - was the fourth lowest of all states.

The Bluegrass State 
also measured the fourth-highest percentage of people below the poverty 
line and people on food stamps/SNAP benefits.

Among the desirable places to settle down, Utah, Minnesota and Colorado were the top picks.

Job opportunities in Utah were 
believed to be booming.

The state ranks among the highest in Gallup’s 
job creation index, its residents have a positive outlook on life and 
were among the healthiest in the union.

Smokers are scarce and the state
ranks among the lowest for obesity rates.

Minnesota is also showing signs of 
economic growth and its residents remain optimistic. The state is conscientious about health and exercise - with 
low smoking rates and regular visits to the dentists.

Not surprisingly, Hawaii - the 
popular honeymoon and vacation destination - fared well on the list of 
most favorable places to live. 

Though job prospects on the island are actually low, its median household income of $63,030 is the fifth highest in the country and higher than the U.S. average of $50,046.

The
island's residents are also healthy with a low smoking rate of 16 per 
cent and the 10th-lowest rate of obese residents at 23.3 per 
cent.

Additionally 
Colorado, Nebraska and North Dakota were among the best places to live, 
with low poverty rates and promising economic opportunities for 
residents.
