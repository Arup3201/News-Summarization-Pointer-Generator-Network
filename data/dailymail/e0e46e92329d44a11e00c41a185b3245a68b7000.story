Joanne Calderwood is desperate to fight in front of her home fans after the UFC announced it would be making its first-ever visit to Scotland.

The promotion will debut in Glasgow on July 18 and will also visit Krakow in Poland and the German capital Berlin during 2015.

And strawweight Calderwood wants to be part of history this summer.

'I feel so excited - this is the first time the UFC will be in Scotland so it is an amazing opportunity,' she said.

'I'm expecting an amazing crowd and a great atmosphere and I'm sure the UFC will keep coming back.

I really, really, really want to be on that card. I don't want anything else. To not be a part of the biggest event in history for Scottish MMA would really hurt me.

'I've got a lot of support from people everywhere so I think people would definitely travel to watch me if I was on the card.

'I'm so excited about this - I've fought in Scotland before and I know how loud the crowd can be and how excited people will be on the night.'

The UFC also announced two exciting fights in Poland on April 11.

After a three year absence, legend Mirko 'Cro Cop' Filipovic will return to the Octagon to meet Gabriel Gonzaga in the five-round heavyweight headline event, while Jan Blachowicz takes on London's Jimi Manuwa in the co-main event.

Blachowicz said: 'This means a great deal to me. UFC in Poland is growing so quickly and Polish fans have been traveling all over the world to watch MMA events for a long time now.

'For us to have a UFC event in our home country is truly amazing.'

The next event in Berlin, meanwhile, will take place on June 20, with German light-heavyweight star Nick Hein keen to fight in front of a home crowd again.

He said: 'I was overwhelmed by the support of the German public last year. The journey that the sport of MMA has taken in my home country is remarkable and the fan base just keeps on growing.

'To know that the UFC will be back in Berlin this year is just fantastic and I would love, more than anything, to have the opportunity to fight in my home country once again.'
