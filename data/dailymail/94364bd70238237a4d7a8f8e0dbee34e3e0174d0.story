Mason is one of 10 in Grace's collection of dolls. They are made of vinyl  transformed - or 'reborn' - with paint and faux hair to resemble real babies as much as possible. with paint and fake hair to look as much like real babies as possible.

She bought her first doll more than three years ago and has spent more than $1,500 on her collection.

Speaking to the Kansas City Star, Grace said: 'I've taken a couple of them down to Branson [Missouri] - senior citizen heaven.

'The women down there went nuts over them because I take them to the shows and everything.'I've always marched to the beat of my own drum.'

Ronda Cox is a Reborner owns Heavenly Touch Reborn Nursery in Independence, where shes makes dolls to sell with prices starting at $225.

The mother of five real children has made more than 500 Reborn dolls over the last decade, sending them as far as Ireland and Iceland.

'My clientele ranges from 18 months all the way up to age 99,' she said.

Ronda claims that the great thing about a Reborn is that when you're tired of it, you can just put it away.

'It's not going to come screaming, 'I'm hungry!' she told the Kansas City Star.  

Ronda starts making the babies with a kit, containing a head, two arms and two legs. In between each layer of paint she bakes the parts in an oven to set the paint.

Finally she installs acrylic eyes, preferring their glossy appearance over the matte look of painted eyeballs.

'That's what makes the eyes sparkle,' Ronda said. 'And that's what you'd see with a real baby. When they open their eyes, they are kind of sparkly.'

The hair is even more complicated, involving a process called rooting in which she pushes each strand of hair, one at a time, into the vinyl scalp with a barbed needle.

'I love it. It's very relaxing for me,' she said.

One of Ronda's favorite sculptors is Emily Jameson, 24, from Leawood, Kansas, who features her dolls on Facebook and sells them as Babies by Emily.

'I remember the first one I saw,' she told the paper.

'It was smiling, it had red hair, and I thought it looked really realistic. I guess that's what drew me to it - because no other doll I had looked that realistic.'

Ronda says that she sometimes comes across people who are not quite so enamored with their life-like appearance.

'People are pretty rude with the comments,' she said. 'We don't even address them. We just say, ' Everybody has different taste, and everybody is entitled to their own opinion.' '
