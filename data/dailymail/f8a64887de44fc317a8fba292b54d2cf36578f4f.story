The outbreak of bubonic plague has been confirmed in a Madagascan village after at least 20 people died in a week.

The deaths occurred in a village near the north-western town of Mandritsara, and today medical experts on the island confirmed the outbreak.

Last year, 60 people in Madagascar died from bubonic plague, more than in any other country in the world.

Disease: Bubonic plague, carried by fleas like this one, is sweeping through Madagascar

While the disease has been almost entirely eradicated from Europe, there were 256 cases of bubonic plague recorded in Madagascar last year.

Public Health officials had warned of the risk of an outbreak in October - the month is the start of the danger period for the disease as fleas which spread the plague thrive in the humid weather.

The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Pasteur Institute are now working in the country to prevent bubonic plague from becoming even more common, according to the BBC.

Experts are particularly concerned 
about the prospect of an epidemic started in Madagascar's crowded and 
filthy prisons and then spreading when inmates are released or receive 
visitors.

Rats living in the prisons often carry fleas which transmit bubonic plague to humans by biting them.

The disease can then escape to the outside world via staff, visitors, freed inmates or the rats themselves.

'If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town,' Christophe Rogier of the Pasteur Institute told the BBC.

'The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town.'

The ICRC is working to eradicate the disease, but this is particularly difficult as it is necessary not only to kill the rats themselves but also to destroy the fleas living on them.

Although the disease can be cured by antibiotics, rural residents often do not have access to even basic healthcare and can be ashamed to seek treatment.

One farmer told the BBC he had not been allowed to bury his daughter after she died of plague, as officials took her body into quarantine and buried it themselves.

Devastation: The Black Death saw bodies piled up on carts dragged through the streets of Europe

Bubonic plague is one of the most 
devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people 
in the 'Black Death' which hit Europe in the 14th century.

It
is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea 
as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

The
disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance 
of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

It
kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not 
treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of 
infection patients are highly likely to survive.

After
the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in 
Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century.

Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.

However,
there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, 
while in August this year a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after 
eating a groundhog infected with the disease.
