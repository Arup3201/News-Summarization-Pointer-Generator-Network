A tree trimmer is lucky to be alive today after being rushed to a Pittsburgh hospital with a chain saw blade lodged in his neck following a freak accident.

James Valentine, 21, was working high up in a tree in Ross Township Monday afternoon when he was struck in the neck by the saw.

Another worker climbed the tree along Perry Highway and helped him down, and his co-workers left the jagged blade in place to try to limit the bleeding.

Close shave: James Valentine, 21, was working high up in a tree Monday afternoon when he was struck in the neck by the saw, which could be seen in an X-ray right still lodged in his neck and shoulder

Could've been worse: Valentine had emergency surgery at Allegheny General Hospital, where doctors say the saw missed major arteries

KDKA reported that responding police officers were able to remove the motor from the tree-trimming equipment, while a doctor who arrived on the scene just minutes later helped stabilize the victim and joined him in the ambulance. 

Valentine had emergency surgery at Allegheny General Hospital, where doctors say the saw missed major arteries and, instead, cut mostly into muscle. 

Allegheny General Hospital released a striking X-ray Tuesday showing the saw still sticking out of the 21-year-old's neck.

Valentine works for Adler Tree Service in Gibsonia. Its owner, Dominic Migliozzi, calls the rescue ‘amazing,’ the station WPXI reported.

Men at work: Valenine and his co-workers were trying to bring down this Scotch Pine in Ross Township, Pa., when the chain saw he was holding in his hands kicked back

During a bedside interview with the station WPXI, the young man sporting a large white dressing on his neck explained that he was 15 feet off the ground trying to cut down a Scotch Pine at around 2.30pm Monday when tragedy struck.

Valentine, who had moved to Pennsylvania in January for work, recalled that he was trying to avoid touching live power lines when the chain saw in his hands kicked back, slicing into his neck and shoulder.

‘[It was] the worse pain that I’ve ever even thought of,’ said Valentine.

Hearing him scream out in pain, Valentine’s three co-workers dropped whatever they were doing and rushed to his aid, slowly inching him down the tree to the ground, where he waited for help to arrive.

‘Just seeing the blood squirting out… that was the scariest part,’ Valentine recalled.

The
 21-year-old knew he must remain conscious, and he had the 
presence of mind to keep the blade as still and possible and not try to 
remove it from his neck.

Miracle: Valentine, who has been a tree trimmer since age 15, knew not to remove the blade from his body and made sure to keep it still; he plans to go back to work in a couple of weeks

When Valentine arrived in the hospital, doctors determined that the blade missed his carotid artery and spine.

‘Someone was looking over me for sure,’ Valentine said, adding that he believed it was his late grandfather. 

Valentine, who has been a tree trimmer since his sophomore year in high school, plans to go back to work ‘in a week or two.’

‘I'm a tree climber,’ he stated with a smile. ‘That's what I do.’
