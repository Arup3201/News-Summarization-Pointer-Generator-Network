Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger feels the signing of  Gabriel Paulista now gives his squad enough strength in depth, but admitted the Brazilian defender does not speak 'a word of English'.

Gabriel completed a permanent transfer from Villarreal earlier this week following international clearance, with Costa Rica striker Joel Campbell heading in the other direction on loan for the rest of the season as part of a deal said to be worth £11.5million.

Wenger hopes the arrival of the promising 24-year-old will provide some much needed cover at the back and looks set to put Gabriel straight into the squad for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against Aston Villa.

Wenger hopes the defender will be able to adapt to the comabtive demands of the Premier League

'He is a specialist at centre-back and with the fixtures we have in from of us, that is needed,' said Wenger, who confirmed he saw Campbell's long-term future at Arsenal after the player's recent new deal.

'What I saw was a great quality for a defender, his level of concentration.

'He is physically able to adapt to the Premier League because he is quite a good size and is quick as well, has great commitment in the challenges and is a good age for a central defender as well.'

Wenger added: 'You always need time to adapt, especially in a defensive position because you need to know your partners.

'At the moment he does not speak a word of English and that can cost you goals, if you mix going forwards with going backwards, so you need to you need to communicate.

'We try to teach the important words, for example - offside or look at the linesman!'

Wenger, though, accepts the signing of one player will not necessarily eradicate all of Arsenal's defensive shortcomings.

He said: 'First and above all, it is a collective effort to defend well.

'We have shown recently that we can defend well when everybody is focused on it, that is what you want to continue to do.

'But as well we needed one (extra) player, because we had the achilles (problem) of (Laurent) Koscielny, (where) there are no guarantees yet, while Per Mertesacker has played all the games since the start of the season, so we needed somebody.'

Chile forward Alexis Sanchez faces a fitness test on a hamstring problem, and could be rested.

Leaders Chelsea host second-placed Manchester City on Saturday, but Wenger does not believe the championship will be settled by that result alone.

'There is still a long way to go with five points (behind), they (Man City) are not out of it. With eight it would be much more difficult, maybe,' he said.

Arsenal beat City away in their last Premier League match to continue their own recovery.

'We know we have some ground to make up and the fight around the top four is very difficult, the target is consistency now,' Wenger said.

Wenger, meanwhile, added there was 'nothing to announce' on the contract extension of Mikel Arteta, but that midfielder Francis Coquelin was '99 per cent sure' to stay on next season.
