He's the Welsh wonder whose golden gowns sprinkled with shimmering glitter are loved by the likes of Abbey Clancy, Millie Mackintosh and Nicole Scherzinger.

And now, Julien Macdonald has teamed up with Matalan to offer fashion fans a taste of his opulent designs for a fraction of the price.

The fashion designer is launching a stylish and affordable beachwear line full of leopard-print kaftans, shapely swimwear and dazzling accessories.

High glamour: Welsh designer Julien Macdonald has unveiled a beachwear range for high street store Matalan - and it's all under £35!

FEMAIL caught up with the designer to find out all about his new range, which is called Love by Julien Macdonald and lands in stores on June 9 - and he's very excited.

'This is my first venture into competitively priced beachwear and it's safe to say that it's the ultimate glamorous beachwear collection,' he told us.

Something for everyone: Julien says there are shapes to flatter all body types and his 80-year-old mother even has her eye on his designs

The 43-year-old former Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model judge says we can expect plenty of his signature animal prints, as well as tropical orchid prints emblazoned across his 'super chic' new range.

'I was inspired by my travels and my range reflects what the average woman would wear in Ibiza at the beach clubs or even at Glanstonbury. There's lots of glamorous shapes, crystals and really great statement pieces,' he explained.

The King of bling promises that there's something for everyone, whether you're 80 (like his own mother whose already snapped up a kaftan), or a curvier lady who will love the loose shapes.

And his celebrity fans have already got their eyes on his designs, which are priced between £12-£35. 'Millie Mackintosh wore one of my dresses to the BAFTAs and she looked incredible, she always does. She'll have her eyes on a few of my new pieces from this range.'

Julien, who was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to fashion in 2006, also says that best friend and muse Abbey Clancy will look 'fabulous' in his designs and his dream client is Miley Cyrus, who he thinks would look 'gorgeous' in the leopard-print kaftans.

Julien has been putting so much effort into his new range that he's 'slightly behind' on his SS15 collection, which he'll showcase at London Fashion Week in September - and it seems the Merthyr Tydfil-born designer has never been more popular.

He said: 'I'm always fashionably late but the show will go on! I've also been busy dressing celebrity for Cannes and the Grand Prix - there's no dresses left on the rails in London and I've had to turn people down for the first time.'
