A California man was arrested Wednesday on multiple counts of child molestation in what, authorities say, is the largest number of victims by a single predator they can recall in Santa Ana.

Edwin Echeverria, 22, lured boys to his Santa Ana apartment, selling them chips, soda, and other items, KTLA reports. Echeverria's apartment is located near a middle and elementary school.

After gaining their trust, Echeverria would reportedly convince boys -- aged as young as 10 -- to engage in sexual activities with him.

'The number of victims involved [in] this case is extraordinary,' the Santa Ana Police Department's news release stated. 

'Detectives are not aware of any other Santa Ana cases involving a single suspect targeting such a large number of victims within memory.'

Nephew: One man recalled seeing Echeverria giving his nephew and young girls money 

Echeverria was arrested at around 12.30am while leaving his job in Costa Mesa, according to a Santa Ana Police Department news release.

Police were alerted after a mother of one of the alleged victims found evidence of an inappropriate relationship between her son and an unknown person on social media.

After interviewing the child and investigating the matter, authorities identified the person as Echeverria and within 48 hours found eight more victims, according to the SAPD.

Police are tracking down three additional victims to interview, bringing the total to 1. Authorities believe there may be more, according to KTLA. 

Investigators say Echeverria's inappropriate relationships with young boys began in August 2012 and the most recent incident known occurred two weeks ago, the Orange County Register reports. 

In an interview with KABC, one man recalled Echeverria approaching his nephew. The man said Echeverria attempted to give money to young boys and girls. 

Echeverria was due in court Thursday and was being held on $1 million bail, according to KTLA.
