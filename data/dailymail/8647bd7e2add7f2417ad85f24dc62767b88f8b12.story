A student nurse was left fighting for her life after being stabbed in a random attack as she boarded a bus after a night shift.

Tanya Mitcham, 20, was on her way to visit her supervisor when Rebecca Jackson, also 20, plunged a kitchen knife into her victim's back at Leeds Central Coach Station.

Jackson then walked through the city centre still clutching the 8in knife which was dripping with Miss Mitcham's blood.

Speaking at Leeds Crown Court about the attack, Miss Mitcham said that at first she did not realise what had happened.

She had to be treated at Leeds General Infirmary after being stabbed once in her left arm, severing an artery and a vein, and twice in her back, narrowly avoiding her spine.

Miss Mitcham broke down while giving evidence and Judge Peter Collier adjourned the hearing for several minutes so that she could compose herself.

'I felt like someone was punching me. I was in that much shock over what was going on really.

'I touched my arm and I felt the blood. I started to scream.

'Everyone seemed to be staring at me when I was shouting to phone an ambulance. I didn't feel like anyone was going to help me. I started stumbling backwards.'

Before the attack on April 18 2011, Jackson had been to Leeds General Infirmary at 9am to be treated for cuts to her head. She told a nurse that she wanted to kill her mother.

Staff nurse Angie Stafford told the court: 'She said, "It's not me, I need to harm my mum". Then I asked her about it some more and she said "I need to kill my mum".'

But before a mental health team could see to her, Jackson left the hospital heading to a shop where she stole the knife.

She then sent a text message to a friend which said 'Nicked a knife to kill the diff [sic]'.

She was then seen at the bus station, acting strangely and aggressively before approaching Miss Mitcham and stabbing her from behind three times.

Student support worker, Holly Pettit, witnessed the attack and gave first aid by applying pressure until paramedics arrive.

She said: I heard a woman scream and I saw her take out a knife. Blood just spilled out onto the floor.

'I turned her round and there was a big gaping hole with lots of blood seeping out.'

Miss Mitcham had to be resuscitated at Leeds General Infirmary and underwent surgery but has been left with scarring across her left shoulder, left arm and her back.

Jackson then walked through Leeds city centre with blood on her hands. Karen Downend saw her drop the knife's packaging and went to give it back to her when she noticed the blade.

She said: 'I thought "she has a crazed look on her face". She was waving it about. There was blood dripping as she was walking and I thought she had cut herself.'

When Jackson was arrested she told police 'I thought I saw my mother so I stabbed her'.

Jackson was charged with attempted murder but found to be not mentally fit to plead and flanked by four carers in the dock .

After a one day trial, a jury took 30 minutes to return a verdict that Jackson had carried out the act and she was detained at a mental health hospital.

It is expected she will be made the subject of a hospital order later today after the court has heard evidence from a psychiatrist.
