 father's lap on Thursday.

A police report alleged the suspects tried to murder officers by throwing stones at them during the raid.

The report lodged a complaint against Muhammad Yassen's whole family, which included his nine-month-old grandson, The Express Tribune reported.

Sub-Inspector Kashif Ahmed has now reportedly been suspended for registering the case against the child.

The child's father said the group had been protesting against a shortage of electricity in their area, The Times of India reported.

The child was charged along with other members of his family following a raid by police to catch suspected gas thieves in Lahore

The judge was unable to dismiss the case against the child because it was outside of his jurisdiction, The News International has reported.

Punjab's Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif meanwhile has now intervened and ordered a report from the police's Inspector General.

He also reportedly demanded 'stern action' against the officials responsible for bringing the case, according to The Nation.

The Minister for Human Rights and Minorities Affairs Khalil Tahir Sindhu is also said to have taken notice of the case.
