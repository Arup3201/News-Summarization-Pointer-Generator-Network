The Great British Bake Off has turned into such a sure-fire ratings success that the BBC’s top executives, it appears, have decided they all want a slice of the cake.

The controller of BBC2 has hinted that the show could be poached by the corporation’s main channel next year after rival executives started ‘sniffing’ around in the wake of its recent popularity.

Janice Hadlow – who earns £235,000 as the head of BBC2 – revealed that the new controller of BBC1 Charlotte Moore may soon take Bake Off away from her channel.

Sweet success: The fourth series of the baking show kicked off to record viewing figures

Miss Moore was the first to commission Bake Off in 2010, and it is thought that she now wants to regain control of the show.

On Tuesday, the first episode of the latest series attracted 5.6million viewers – a record for a series opener.

Asked whether the programme would be moving to BBC1 next year, Miss Hadlow told an audience at the Edinburgh Television Festival: ‘You know, 5.6million provokes some sniffing.

‘At the moment we’re just very happy to have it and it feels as though it’s a lovely show for us.

‘We’ll see what happens. I think it’s a bit like a flag going up isn’t it? If you have a programme that ends with 7million [viewers] it’s not going to be unnoticed is it?

‘I think it’s something that if you’re running a channel like BBC2 you have to take into your stride.’

She added: ‘We’ve nurtured this programme, we love it but who knows? It’s happened to other programmes, we’ve seen other programmes move and you can’t legislate against it.’

Miss Hadlow denied that there was a ‘turf war’ at the corporation but appeared to concede that she would be powerless to stop the show moving over to BBC1.

‘I would have to be collegiate and think of the BBC as a whole,’ she said.

And she also took the opportunity to address the recent marital woes of presenter Paul Hollywood.

The 47-year-old baker split from his wife Alexandra in May following speculation that he had started an affair with his American Bake Off co-star, Mexican chef Marcela Valladolid.

Miss Hadlow explained that any presenters working for the BBC needed to be able to ‘manage’ their private lives, adding: ‘He knows himself, he has been open about it.

‘If you are in the public eye your actions will get attention and it’s just about being aware of that. I think our presenters know that they are always presenters. Even in their private life they will be seen as the BBC presenter.

‘In the end what goes on in their private life is not necessarily something we can manage and they have to manage it themselves.’

Differing tastes: Viewers took to Twitter to express their love for Mary Berry... but a cooler regard for Paul Hollywood

The BBC have repeatedly denied that 
the judge’s personal woes would affect the programme. But the Daily Mail
revealed fans were so furious about the rumoured affair that many 
threatened to stop watching the show altogether.

Producer
Richard McKerrow admitted bosses had been concerned that Hollywood’s 
behaviour would spark a viewer backlash, telling audiences at the same 
festival: ‘I worried about it, of course I did…we had people saying I’m 
not going to watch Bake Off.’

Mr McKerrow said he felt people decided not to boycott the show because they had forgiven Hollywood.

But viewers have been lukewarm in their response to his appearance. Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘I’ve lost pretty much all respect for Paul Hollywood but at least we have Mary Berry, she’s a saint.’
