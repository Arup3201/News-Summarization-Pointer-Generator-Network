Thousands of miles of British farmland could be turned into 'bee motorways' in a bid to boost the declining number of pollinating insects in the country.

The scheme would see farmers and land owners volunteering their fields toward a 3,000-mile corridor of plush grassland filled with wildflowers which encourage bees and other insects to migrate.

Others may receive a grant or bursary for allowing use of their estates.

Breeding ground: Patches of grassland, such as the in Balranald RSPB reserve, above, are perfect for pollintors to thrive in.

The plan is to encourage migration across the country rather than having certain insects confined to separate patches of the country, as is the case with some species now.

It is hoped that the 'bee lines' would also help butterflies, moths and hover flies to spread their wings and breed across Britain.

The scheme, which has been strongly backed by the Liberal Democrats, is the brainchild of wildlife charity Buglife.

They have already begun recruiting landowners in Yorkshire, where it is estimated that 60,000 acres are needed for pollinating beasts to thrive.

The project comes at a time when the honey bee population of the UK is in steep decline.

It is believed that there are only half the number of nectar producing insects pollinating in the country now, compared to population figures of 25 years ago.

And the decline in bees and other species is not just a worry for insect lovers.

Migration: If the plan is successful, it could see not only the honey bee, left, but also butterflies, right, and other pollinating species more widespread in Britain

According to farming experts, around 90 per cent of food and crops in our country are thought to be depend on pollinators.

Currently in around 60 per cent of the insects who help plants reproduce are in decline.

The causes of this drastic reduction has been put down to factors such as toxic pesticides, habitat loss, disease and intensive agriculture which has meant there is now less wild grassland in which the insects can breed.

Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, who has already presented plans to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, said losing our insects could mean losing a major part of our source.

Support: Climate change secretary Ed Davey, above, is said to be a fan of the bee motorway scheme having previously voiced concerns about the decline in pollinator numbers

Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: 'If we lose a lot of our pollinator species, we lose a lot of the options for feeding ourselves. The mroe we lose the less likely we are to be able to feed ourselves in an efficient way.'

Climate change secretary Ed Davey is said to be behind the initiative, while Baroness Parminter, a leading Lib Dem has also lent her backing.

The environment spokeswoman in the House of Lords said: 'The government is putting together a comprehensive strategy for all pollinators, but until we have that, it is important that projects like this are supported.'
