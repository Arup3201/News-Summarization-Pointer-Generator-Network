The mother of James Bulger has been abused on Twitter by someone posing as her child's killer Jon Venables.

Detectives on Merseyside are investigating after an account was set up to crow to Denise Fergus about her toddler's brutal murder in 1993.

Using the name @SirJVenables the troll also wrote vile messages about harbouring a desire to kill more children, but has since been suspended by Twitter after an online campaign.

The offensive account used the chilling CCTV image of James Bulger being led to his death byVenables and friend Robert Thompson, who were were 
jailed for eight years for sadistically killing the two-year-old when they were 10.

Shameful: Denise Fergus, mother of James Bulger, has been attacked by a  Twitter troll using the name Jon Venables, who was convicted of her son's murder in 1993

Investigation: Detectives on Merseyside are trying to find the person behind the account, which has been suspended after it caused fury online

Calm: Despite the distressing and abusive messages, James' mother Denise did not rise to the taunts from her latest tormentor

The troll wrote to her: 'His little life shattered with one blow, through his catatonic eyes'.

He also tweeted: 'You want me to get serious, become a gormless fool like the rest of you? Not thanks, I'll stay true to myself and plot your child's death'.

Incredibly, on her own Twitter account, Mrs Fergus did not react angrily, and calmly wrote: 'Here we go again, I'm not interested... #TickTock.'

Two years ago she suffered further after trolls set up a sickening Facebook group mocking
 her son’s death called: 'What happened to Jamie Bulger was f****** hilarious'.

There was a successful campaign to shut it down and internet users have again flocked to support Mrs Fergus.

Gingio wrote: 'The @SirJVenables account has been suspended. Good work Twitter. Now need the Police to catch the idiot behind it'.

FlutterbyLpool tweeted: 'Sure somebody from @MerseyPolice will be investigating this sick individual. Words fail me. @SirJVenables.'

This morning the Merseyside force confirmed it was investigating, adding: 'Thanks to all who have reported the offensive tweets. An investigation into the account concerned is underway'.

Mrs Fergus said: 'I'm relieved that the police and Twitter have decided to investigate this. 

'The people who send sick messages need to know that they cannot get away with it by hiding behind false names.

'What has been said by these pathetic trolls is meant to hurt me and my family, but it does not work.  

'I've become pretty thick-skinned, so I do not take any notice of what they say because they are not even worth thinking twice about.

'Police must be able to prosecute the 
culprits to send a clear message to twisted individuals that they will 
not get away with insulting and harassing people.

'I hope they 
find them, charge them and give them the stiffest penalty that they can 
get.  They need to be taught a sharp lesson.'

Reaction: The discovery of the account has led to hundreds of tweets from people demanding action from Twitter and the police

Liverpool Councillor Morrison had shared a photo of his two-day-old nephew only to be sent death threats by a troll posing as Venables.

He demanded a response from Twitter after the abuse, and has now been invited to hold an emergency meeting with UK managing director Bruce Daisley.

Cllr Morrison said: 'These are the most extreme tweets I have ever seen, people having a thrill from this is quite frankly disgusting.

'I contacted Bruce and heard back within ten minutes from him looking to arrange a meeting with his team.

'It's about time we prosecute the one responsible for this. We're not blaming the police or Twitter but they have to work together in order to stop this for good.'

Mrs Fergus has agreed to attend a telephone conference with Twitter chiefs in order to discuss the current problems giving online bullies a platform to target people with abuse.

'It is time Twitter made it a priority to close down trolls and I want to meet them to explain that this is something that they need to make a top priority,' she said.

'They can't just wash their hands of it. They need to be proactive. They should have a 'report abuse' button on Twitter to silence these trolls immediately.'

Sadistic: James Bulger was found on a railway line where he was battered to death by Venables and Thompson

Venables and Robert Thompson were 10 when they abducted James.

The
 pair walked the toddler several miles to a railway line in Walton, 
where they tortured and killed him, leaving his body on a train line 
where it was hit by a train.

After a public outcry and release of the haunting CCTV footage, the two boys were arrested about a week later.

Venables was first given a new identity when he and 
Thompson were sent to a young offenders' institution for murdering the 
toddler.

A second new identity was created for him when he was 
released in 2001, and he was given a third identity after he was sent 
back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images.

Venables 
left prison in September last year with a fourth new identity  after being hauled back to prison in 2010 for possessing child porn.

This took the total cost of his secret identities to £1million.

And despite 
recommendations by an official review into how Venables was allowed to 
re-offend last time he was released, he has not been fitted with a new 
sat-nav GPS tagging bracelet.

The device would allow probation officers to remotely monitor his every move.

Former
 Home Office mandarin Sir David Omand said the tag could stop him 
sneaking back to Liverpool – which he did repeatedly last time.

Under
 the terms of his release, Venables has been banned from trawling sex 
sites on the internet and once again ordered to stay away from 
Merseyside.

Currently the GPS tracker is only available in 
‘extreme’ circumstances and, to the dismay of James’s family, Venables 
has not been selected by officials to wear the device.
