Killer driver: Wayne Payne - already serving a five-year
 jail term for driving into Cameron Ward - received a fresh three-year 
prison sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to supply

A driver who hit and killed a boy of five then told his victim's family 's*** happens, life goes on' has been convicted of dealing cocaine while on bail for the tragedy.

Wayne Payne - already serving a five-year jail term for driving into Cameron Ward - received a fresh three-year prison sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to supply.

The 31-year-old sparked outrage when he callously told Cameron’s family: 'S**t happens, life goes on' as he left Birmingham Crown Court after a court hearing last month.

A judge who sentenced Payne for the drug offence condemned him as a common street dealer and said he committed the crime after being bailed in connection with Cameron’s death.

Recorder Kevin Hegarty told him: 'Society takes a dim view of people dealing in class A drugs.'

Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court that police found almost five grams of cocaine in a bag hidden inside a cooker at Payne’s home in Mount View, Sutton Coldfield, on October 4 last year.

Officers also recovered two bags of cutting agents from a kitchen worktop, along with a set of electronic scales and £380 stashed under a rug.

The three-year jail term will run consecutively to the five-year sentence imposed on Payne last month after he was found guilty of causing Cameron’s death by dangerous driving.

Payne told the court he had used drugs for eight years and claimed he added a cutting agent to the cocaine to make it last longer.

Payne was travelling at twice the area's legal speed limit in his Vauxhall Vectra when he hit a bike on which Cameron was sitting in Court Lane, Erdington, on April 1 last year.

The 
schoolboy’s father John Ward was wheeling the Paget Primary pupil along on a
 pushbike ahead of mum Katie Lawrence and baby sister Ruby, who was just
 four-weeks-old at the time, as the family returned from an Easter party.

Payne hit 
the rear of the bike, causing Cameron to be flung into the air. Police 
and paramedics were called to the scene but the schoolboy could not be 
saved.

Mr
 Ward, 37, said he had seen the lights of a vehicle about 200 metres 
away and had gone out into the road between two parked cars.

Cameron Ward was tragically killed when he was hit by Payne, who was driving 61mph in a 30mph area

Crime scene: Court Lane, Erdington, in Birmingham where Cameron was killed last year. Payne went on to callously tell Cameron's family 's*** happens, life goes on' after a court appearance last month

'I thought it was safe to cross the road,' he said. 'It happened very quickly. It was over in seconds.

'I don't know how I got up but I did. I knew he was dead. I wanted to disappear. Cameron was my life and I had lost him.'

A jury took just 45 minutes to convict Payne of the motoring offence.

The trial heard Payne, who was also banned from driving for five years, was travelling at 61mph in a 30mph zone and he had not braked before the collision.
