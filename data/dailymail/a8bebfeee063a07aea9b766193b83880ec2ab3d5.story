Andrew Flintoff has been left out of Lancashire's squad for the NatWest Twenty20 Blast Roses match against Yorkshire on Friday.

The news capped a disappointing day for Flintoff, who scored just 16 and took two wickets but leaked 39 runs in the second XI T20 defeat by Leicestershire at Arundel.

It was the first time in five years that the 36-year-old had featured for the county after last week signing a deal to play Twenty20 cricket.

Oops: Andrew Flintoff was bowled for 16 as he prepares for the Twenty20 blast with Lancashire seconds

With the ball: Flintoff took two for 39 against Leicestershire at Arundel on Thursday morning

Flintoff took three wickets in a club 
game for St Annes last Saturday, but his inclusion in Lancashire’s team 
for the semi-final of the Second XI T20 competition was a step up in 
class.

However, he did not do enough to be selected in Lancashire’s squad for Friday ’s Roses match against Yorkshire in the Natwest T20 Blast at Old
 Trafford.

Despite
 one fumble in the field the former England all-rounder, noticeably 
fitter than when he ended his international career in 2009, did not look
 out of place.

This ground, 
set amid the stunning backdrop of Arundel Castle in Sussex, is a far cry from Edgbaston, the scene of perhaps the 
Lancastrian’s greatest England performance during the 2005 Ashes.

At a stretch: The 36-year-old got through his four overs easily enough as he continues his comeback

He
 may not be as quick as back then, but there was still a reminder of the
 Flintoff of old when he bowled Michael Thornley in the fifth over.

He picked up a wicket late on too, Leicestershire’s Usman Tariq caught in the deep.

Flintoff
 then opened the batting alongside Luis Reece, scoring a run-a-ball 16 
before he was bowled attempting to sweep left-arm spinner James Sykes. 

Lancashire
 never really looked likely to chase down their target of 186, 
Leicestershire eventually winning by 29 runs to reach the final.

It had started so well: The all-rounder was scoring at a run a ball until he was bowled by spinner James Sykes

Big drawer: Flintoff is to be paid per spectator when he begins playing for the Red Rose first XI again

However, far bigger prizes await both the county and Flintoff himself if he can make a successful comeback to the first team.

On the basis of this performance, the jury is still out on whether he can still cut it at the top level.

But it certainly promises to be fun finding out.
