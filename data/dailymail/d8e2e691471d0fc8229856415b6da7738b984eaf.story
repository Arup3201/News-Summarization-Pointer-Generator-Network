A bank manager has allegedly gone on the run and abandoned her two children after using bogus credit cards to buy £100,000 worth of jewellery

Mother-of-two Oxana Abakumova, 32, is accused of giving bogus credit cards to three elderly male customers of the bank she ran in the town of Beloretsk in the Russian region of Bashkiria in the Ural Mountains. 

It is claimed that without their knowledge she then used the cards to buy jewellery worth £100,000.

When the scam caught up with her she abandoned her children, aged two and seven, and went on the run, it has been reported in the Russian press. 

Police said she had been working as a trusted employee in the credit department of the OTP Bank and simply took advantage of her position.

It is claimed she persuaded the victims to hand over their passports which she used to get credit.

Police were tipped off about the irregularities in the accounts in February and arranged to interview staff including Oxana.

It is claimed that without the men's knowledge Abakumova used the cards to buy jewellery worth £100,000

As soon the interviews were over, it is claimed that Abakumova took her children to their grandparents and fled.

Police say she has not been seen since and could face 10 years behind bars for fraud.
