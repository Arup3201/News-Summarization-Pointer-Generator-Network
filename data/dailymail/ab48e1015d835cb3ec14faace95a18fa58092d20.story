A music festival descended into momentary chaos when a rat ran into the packed audience - and bit three people.

Musician Raleigh Randall may have thought the girls were screaming for him during his performance at the Evolution Festival in Newcastle yesterday, but soon found the crowd was jumping to avoid a rodent - and was so upset he re-started his track.

The rat made its unscheduled appearance at the festival on Newcastle's Quayside yesterday, upstaging Raleigh and attacking two female revellers and a security guard.

All three suffered small bites and were treated on site, but had to be sent to hospital to get antibiotics.

The rat made its appearance in front of the stage during Raleigh Randall's performance on Sunday, and the crowd went even wilder when it ran into the audience, biting two girls.

However, thanks to a quick-thinking event security supervisor the madness did not last long.

The security man used his booted foot to catch the rat by the tail, before using a plastic cup to scoop it up into a cardboard box - but not before being bitten himself.

The rat was then removed from the site to the claps and cheers of the festival audience - and the relief of Raleigh Randall.

No fear: The security guard gets rid of the rat using a plastic cup and a cardboard box - and the audience is safe

Spectator Jordan Crosby, who witnessed the rat-race, said: ‘I think it just appeared in front of the barriers and ran through the crowds. It bit the security guard that tried to pick it up - he took it backstage.

‘Someone should sign it up - I think it will be headlining next year.

‘I don't think Raleigh Randall noticed what went on - he probably thought all the screaming was for him.'

Back on track: Once the rampant rodent had been captured and removed, Randall Raleigh could continue his set

Paul Kennedy, a press officer for the 
Evolution Festival, said: ‘We can confirm that three people were bitten 
by a rat at yesterday's festival, two female festival goers and a member
of the pit security team.

‘All had small bites and were treated by the on-site medical teams.

‘They were sent to hospital to get antibiotics. No further medical action was required.’
