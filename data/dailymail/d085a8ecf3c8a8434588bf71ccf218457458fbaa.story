Take a look at these pictures and consider for a moment what these rather brutal looking metal contraptions might be.

Are they power tools? Medieval torture devices? The world's first hairdryers? Archaic egg whisks? Nope, these are actually Victorian vibrators, a collection of vintage self-massagers currently on display at 
Littledean Jail in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, a former house of correction, 
police station and courthouse-turned-visitor attraction.

And exhibits include Dr Macaura's Pulsocon Hand Crank Vibrator, which dates back to 1890 and resembles an old-fashioned egg whisk.

This may look like an early hair dryer with different attachments, but it is actually a vintage 'self-massager', used by women as a vibrator in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

Dr. Macaura's Pulsocon Hand Crank (1890) Vibrator, which resembles an archaic egg whisk, is now on display at Littledean Jail, Forest of Dean,

According to Philip Larkin, sex began in 1963, between the end of the Lady Chatterley ban and the Beatles' first LP.

But this collection of Victorian vibrators shows self-pleasuring has been going on for a whole lot longer than that.

Littledean Jail owner and curator Andy Jones, 51, described the assortment of sex toys as 'a fascinating insight into women's pleasure during Victorian times'.

The 'ACME' hand-held vibrator shows self-pleasuring has been going on for a whole lot longer than we originally believed

When compared to today's vibrators such as the pink plastic rampant rabbit, the ACME is certainly a lot less... girly

But despite its pleasurable connotations, the modern-style vibrator was actually invented by respectable Victorian doctors.

'Pelvic massage' was a common treatment for female hysteria during the Victorian era.

However, doctors found the process of administering the massage by hand tiring and time-consuming, and so devised a device to do the job for them.

Dr Joseph Mortimer Granville patented an electromechanical vibrator around 1880, a story told in the 2011 film Hysteria, featuring Maggie Gyllenhaal.

'If you plug them in, the force is incredible. They're loud and some of them look like hairdryers'

The vibrators come packed neatly in cases with a number of different attachments, and resembles an old-fashioned drill and its bits

While some of these contraptions now look like they belong more in a torture chamber than beneath the sheets, they serve as testament to the ingenuity of Victorian inventors.

The sex toys also offer a fascinating insight into the supposedly 'prim and proper' Victorian world, in which some families would supposedly cover up table legs since they were seen as suggestive and risque.

'If you plug them in, the force is incredible,' Jones said. 'They're loud and some of them look like hairdryers.

'I would imagine it would have been quite a painful exercise, judging by what I've seen of them, like having a kango hammer pressed against your body.'
