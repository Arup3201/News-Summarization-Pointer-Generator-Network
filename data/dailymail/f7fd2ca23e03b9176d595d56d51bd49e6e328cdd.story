A six-year-old girl with cerebral palsy is finally able to walk after her father raised £50,000 to pay for treatment in America. 

Lily Ketteringham, of Benton, North Tyneside, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two and for a while, her future looked bleak.

But a chance meeting between her father Steve, 43, and a woman whose child had received similar treatment in the US has changed Lily's life.

Mr Ketteringham, who works in the engineering industry, said: 'We were told that Lily would miss many milestones, that she would have trouble with her speech, and that it was possible she would never walk.

'But I was determined for her to fulfill her potential.'

He came across a specially adapted trike on eBay and decided to buy it for Lily.

And when he went round to collect it, the owner told him that her child had also got cerebral palsy but had greatly improved since having Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) surgery.

Mr Ketteringham researched the pioneering surgery which stimulates muscles in the spine and unscrambles mixed messages sent from the brain to the limbs.

He then applied to the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri, which accepted that Lily would benefit from the procedure.

However, there was one problem - the treatment would cost £37,000.

He added: 'Nothing was going to stop be from raising that money for Lily.

'I knew she needed this treatment and that it would give her the best possible chance of walking.

'I ran the Great North Run, did the coast to coast, friends and family got involved and eventually I made it and had the money to pay for the operation and the trip over to America.'

In the end, he smashed his target and raised £50,000, with the extra money helping to pay for travel costs and other expenses.

Lily and her father spent around a month in America between January and February last year.

The treatment appears to have been successful and Lily is now using special canes to walk, and is also able to stand up on her own for the first time.

Mr Ketteringham added: 'I am so happy Lily has undergone this procedure. It was the best possible thing we could have done.

'It has been hard for her though, she has had to put in a lot of work to get to where she is now.

'I am hoping she will be able to walk completely on her own in the next year. I think that is a realistic goal.

'I am so proud of Lily. Despite everything she has been through she is a very happy, smiley and sociable little girl.'
