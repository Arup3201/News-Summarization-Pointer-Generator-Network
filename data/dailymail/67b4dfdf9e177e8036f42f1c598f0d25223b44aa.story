A photographer is challenging people to spot his black and white border collie in a series of Where's Waldo-style images.

Unlike the conventional cluttered mess of red and white stripes, Andrew Knapp's work is serene and spare, with seemingly nothing in the scene to hide behind. 

Nonetheless, his beloved pet Momo is concealed within every one. 

Andrew Knapp is releasing his second collection of adorable pics of his dog Momo in a Where's Waldo Style hidden-image book 

Collected by photographer Andrew Knapp, the book features his border collie Momo, who loves to hide in unusual places and have his picture taken (SPOILER: Check the bush in the bottom right corner of the fence)

Unlike the conventional cluttered mess of red and white stripes, Andrew Knapp's work is serene and spare, with seemingly nothing in the scene to hide behind (SPOILER: Momo peaks out from behind the tree third from the right)

Knapp, 31, has been carting Momo around his native Ontario, Canada, for almost two years now, building an extensive collection of visual puzzles (SPOILER: Just behind the bumper, Momo hides under the fence)

One shot seemingly shows an empty stretch of beach with just a thin yellow beach stand in the frame.

In another, Momo co-stars with a tartan-skirted lacrosse team.

And his monochrome coat is artfully disguised in one shot of yellow and orange autumn trees. 

In the new book Momo hiding everywhere from Grand Central Station, to the White House, the French Quarter of New Orleans and lesser known venues (SPOILER: He's hiding just between the bench and left edge of the frame)

Knapp hopes this new batch of pics is his most challenging (SPOILER: Momo's head can be seen rising from the street just under the window on the left)

He is hoping the latest batch is his most challenging yet.

Momo has developed many adoring fans, with lots of them trying to convince Andrew Knapp to bring him to areas of the U.S (SPOILER: Take a look in the bushes just to the left of center frame)

Momo follows his owner Andrew everywhere, meeting people along the way (SPOILER: Momo stands out against the tiny bit of blue in front of the walking man)

Some of the pictures are a lot tougher than others (SPOILER: Find Momo just behind the back bumper of this orange truck)

The images are reminiscent of Where's Waldo?, a popular series of books in which readers have to pin point the title character who is among a busy crowd. (SPOILER: Here we can see Momo's head in the center-right of frame with his ears and nose popping above the snow and stone)

The pair took a road trip coast-to-coast across Canada, driving from New England to the South to the Pacific North West, then all the way across back to Sudbury.

It will be the subject of Knapp's latest book, Coast To Coast, which is slated to be published in May 2015.

For this collection, the pair took a road trip coast-to-coast across Canada, driving from New England to the South to the Pacific North West, then all the way across back to Sudbury (SPOILER: Momo is tucked behind the second pillar from far left) 

The series of pictures is based on the 'Find Momo' Instagram account (SPOILER: Momo is just to the right of the middle piece of black debris on the ground)

The series was created by Martin Handford for Walker Books in the 1980s and has been translated into around 30 different languages (SPOILER: Look for Momo at the base of the tree in the front of the shot on the right)

Wally may be recognisable in his red-and-white jumper, glasses and bobble hat but he can take some finding within the bustling illustration.

The series was created by Martin Handford for Walker Books in the 1980s and has been translated into around 30 different languages.

It has also spawned a television show and video game, while a film based on the character is being developed.

The book, from Quirk Books, will be available in March for £11.99.
