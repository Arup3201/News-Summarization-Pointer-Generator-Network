As the presidential race intensifies, both camps have been known to play dirty - but one stunt this week has taken things far too literally.

Campaign volunteers at the Ohio Democratic headquarters arrived for work on Tuesday to be greeted by a large mound of horse manure dumped in front of their office.

No one has owned up to the stunt which happened sometime after 10pm on Monday at the headquarters north of Cincinnati.

Political stink: Democrat volunteers arrived at party headquarters in Ohio on Tuesday to be greeted by a large pile of horse manure

Warren County Democratic chair Beth Goldenfield told CBS Local 12: 'It’s really unfortunate that people 
can’t have respectful disagreements.

'We’re not going to be discouraged 
by it. It’s just very disappointing. It will probably motivate our 
people even more but it’s also a very disrespectful thing to do.'

A report was filed by the party with the Warren County sheriff’s department and the building's security footage was being examined, Ms Goldenfield said. The landlord of the property was left to clean up the mess. 

It is the second incidence of vandalism in the name of politics this week - but in this incidence loyalties lay on the other side.

Vandalism: Someone spray-painted over the name of Romney, Texas and replaced it with 'Obama'

The tiny community of Romney, Texas was hit by an 
aggressive supporter of Barack Obama who took it upon himself to deface 
the sign marking its location.

Romney has no known affiliation to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.

But that (fairly obvious) fact clearly did not deter the anonymous vandal who wrote 'OBAMA' on the town sign.
