A pet owner who kept her dogs in cages so filthy that one of the pets had to be put down has been banned from keeping animals for life.

The pet owner kept her dogs in cages so filthy that one of the pets had to be put down. She has now been banned from keeping animals for life

A statement by Monk, read out in court, said that the had only left the dogs for 'four days' because she had recently suffered a fit and was 'completely out of it'

Floors in the flat that were covered in 'compacted faeces' and urine had attracted 'beetles and flies' and were strewn with hazards, including bottles of bleach. 

The RSPCA were called to the property after neighbours reported hearing dogs inside, even though the owner was rarely there. 

The court heard Nash, who was found underweight and with infected ulcers on his body, had to later be put down.

Kevin McCole, prosecuting on behalf of the animal welfare charity, said: 'The inspector was horrified by what she saw and the smell was so overpowering that she nearly vomited.

The court heard one dog, Nash, who was found underweight and with infected ulcers on his body, had to later be put down

'The dog would have felt pain from hunger, thirst and his skin conditions, and would have continued to suffer organ failure.'

The other dog, a five-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier named Millie, was found overweight and has recovered since being taken treated by the RSPCA.

On Tuesday Monk pleaded guilty to charges of causing unnecessary suffering to animals and breaching her duty of responsibility to ensure animal welfare.

She was banned for life from keeping any animals and was ordered to pay a £300 contribution to the £500 court costs and a victim surcharge of £60.

She was also placed under a six-month supervision order.

Tony Davies, defending, said the treatment of both dogs had been 'dreadful' and 'disgusting' but added she could not be held responsible because of her medical condition.

He said: 'This was not an offence of volition, but of omission and a lack of foresight.

'She was not acting out of a cavalier attitude, but an impaired ability to care for her pets, and we cannot judge her by the same standards as the rest of us.'
