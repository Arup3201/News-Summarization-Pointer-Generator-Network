Proof that the ‘Hill of Jonah’ – or Giv’at Yonah’ - was occupied at the time the prophet is said to have existed has been uncovered by archaeologists.

It is thought that he was buried at the coastal site in Ashdod, Israel, and now the foundation of an ancient fortress with one-metre-wide walls has been exposed in an excavation there by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which dates the remains to the First Temple period - 850 to 586 BC.

It verifies the existence of life there during the time of the eighth-century prophet, who according to Jewish, Christian and Muslim scriptures, defied God and spent three nights in the belly of a fish or whale as punishment before being released.

Evidence: The remains of the fortress indicate that there was life on the Hill of Jonah at the time he was said to have existed

Sa'ar Ganor, the Ashkelon District Archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: ‘Giv'at Yonah, which rises 50 metres above sea level, is the highest hill in Ashdod, whence one can look out to sea, to Tel Mor – located in the Nahal Lachish estuary which was probably an ancient anchorage, and to Tel Ashdod.

‘Due to its strategic location, it is not surprising to find the remains of a fortress that overlooked the region in the First Temple period.’

He adds: ‘There are two possibilities regarding who inhabited the fortress at that time: one possibility is that it was controlled by the Assyrians who were the regional rulers in the Iron Age. Another possibility is that Josiah, king of Judah, occupied the fort at the time, who we know conquered territory from the Assyrians and controlled Ashdod-Yam in the seventh century BC.’

The discovery of this fortress joins other finds from an excavation that took place very close to the site in the 1960s.

In an excavation carried out before the construction of the modern Ashdod lighthouse, similar wall remains were found that date to the First Temple period and Persian period (539 to 334 BC).

Here an Aramaic phrase was found indicating that an individual named Ba'altzad contributed a sum of money that was given as a donation for a holy place.
