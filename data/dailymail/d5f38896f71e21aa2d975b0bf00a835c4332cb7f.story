Joanna Yeates suffered 43 injuries in a prolonged ‘violent struggle’ as she fought for her life, a jury heard yesterday.

Marks on the 25-year-old’s body were said to be consistent with her being pinned down and strangled with both hands by her 6ft 4in neighbour Vincent Tabak. Tabak admits the manslaughter of Miss Yeates but denies her murder.

Yesterday, on the second day of his murder trial, the jury at Bristol Crown Court heard described in harrowing detail the final moments of the landscape architect’s life.

Nigel Lickley, prosecuting, said that 
on December 17 last year Dutch engineer Tabak pinned down 5ft 4in Miss 
Yeates by her wrists as he used his height advantage to overpower his 
neighbour.

‘Her neck was held for long enough and
hard enough to kill her,’ the QC said. ‘There was a violent struggle by
Miss Yeates to survive.

‘Death
was not instantaneous. It took sufficient force to kill her. There was 
no sign of a use of a ligature. He might have let go but he did not. He 
knew that Miss Yeates was in pain and struggling to breathe. Despite 
that Vincent Tabak continued to hold and squeeze her neck to kill her.’

Mr
Lickley added that a fracture to her nose and bruising to her head 
‘could have been as a result of a forcible contact with the floor or 
other object’. Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney concluded Miss
Yeates died of compression of the neck, probably using two hands.

The
jury also heard that when Miss Yeates’s body was found eight days later
on Christmas Day, covered by snow beside a country lane, her T-shirt 
and bra had been pushed up to partially expose her right breast.

Tabak’s
DNA was later discovered on her chest, while police also uncovered 
clothing fibres and blood spots linking Miss Yeates to his silver 
Renault Megane car.

The 
33-year-old university graduate is said to have killed his next-door 
neighbour within minutes of her returning to the garden flat she shared 
with boyfriend Greg Reardon, 28, in Clifton, Bristol.

Yet
he maintained throughout his police interviews that he played no part 
in her death. The court heard that when he was first arrested in 
January, Tabak tried to explain away incriminating forensic evidence by 
suggesting lab workers who processed the DNA material were corrupt.

But less than three weeks later, he is said to have confided to a prison chaplain that he had news which would ‘shock’ him.

Mr
Lickley said Tabak told Peter Brotherton, a volunteer in the prison 
where he was on remand, that he would plead guilty ‘for the crime that I
have done’. When questioned further, he confirmed he was talking about 
‘the young lady in Bristol’.

He eventually pleaded guilty to Miss Yeates’s manslaughter three months later.

Mr
Lickley said that during a statement Tabak gave after his arrest in 
January, he placed himself in his victim’s flat, saying he wandered into
the entrance to speak to his landlord, Christopher Jefferies, who also 
owned Miss Yeates’s accommodation.

He
also told officers he might have eaten a pizza on the night of the 
murder. The Tesco pizza Miss Yeates bought just before she died has 
never been found and scientists have determined that she didn’t eat it 
herself.

The court had 
previously heard Tabak also told police Mr Jefferies had a habit of 
entering his flat without permission and had offered police potentially 
incriminating evidence about his landlord’s car in a bid to throw them 
off his scent.

At the time, Mr Jefferies was under arrest in connection with the murder, although he was later cleared of involvement.

Mr
Lickley told the jury that by admitting manslaughter, Tabak ‘accepts he
unlawfully killed’ Miss Yeates. The QC said that what the jury had to 
consider was his state of mind when he killed her.

He
did not lose control, the prosecution suggested, but ‘chose to continue
until she was dead’. ‘He didn’t panic… he was seen on film making 
decisions and beginning to cover his tracks,’ Mr Lickley said.

Tabak 
‘wanted and intended’ to kill her ‘and it is our case that he is guilty 
of murder’, he added.

Miss 
Yeates’s parents, David and Teresa, attended the first day of the trial 
but were absent yesterday as  forensic evidence linking Tabak to their 
daughter was outlined.

The court heard that the DNA found on Miss 
Yeates’s chest was one million times more likely to belong to  the 
defendant than any other unknown individual. Tabak’s DNA was also found 
on the back of her jeans, suggesting he had carried her under the knees.

Mr Lickley had already 
told the court that after ‘squeezing the life out’ of Miss Yeates, Tabak
drove to Asda – where CCTV showed him buying beer, crisps and rock salt
– with her body in the boot of his car.

He then allegedly dumped her 
body later that night in Longwood Lane – three miles from Miss Yeates’s 
flat – and returned to Bristol to collect his girlfriend, Tanja Morson, 
35, from an office Christmas party.

While at Asda, the court heard he sent his girlfriend a text saying he was ‘bored’.

Tabak
told police that before heading to the superstore, he had driven his 
car from the road to his driveway to warm up the engine.

Mr
Lickley told the jury that moving the car ‘to the side of the house may
have been the opportunity to place Miss Yeates into the boot’.

In the days and weeks after the murder, Tabak avidly followed the police website for news of the case.

The
prosecution also alleges that he described the killer as a ‘detached, 
crazy person who was able to carry on with life’ at a dinner party the 
following month. Mr Lickley said he had been describing himself.

The trial continues.

Struggle for survival: The injuries suffered by Joanna Yeates was revealed to the jury

An examination of Joanna Yeates’s body revealed the shocking catalogue of injuries from her struggle for survival.

Home Office pathologist Russell Delaney found bruises and grazes on her neck and chin, Bristol Crown Court heard.

His post-mortem examination also uncovered haemorrhages, including under her eyelids, while a blood clot in her nose was likely to have been a result of the compression to her neck.

Marks on her wrists suggested she had been pinned down, while the pathologist also found a small fracture at the base of her nose.

The court heard blood may have dislodged from her nose and dripped on to the stone wall close to where her body was discovered as Vincent Tabak tried in vain to lift her body over the wall.

In addition to the fractured nose, there were 12 injuries to Miss Yeates’s head and neck, three to her torso, 12 to her right arm, 11 to her left arm, one on her right leg and three on her left leg.

A later internal examination found further bruising beneath the skin and possible injury to her voice box.

‘The overall pattern of injuries indicate an episode of manual compression of the neck that is known as strangulation,’ prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told the jury.

‘Quite apart from the fear an attack might cause, direct compression will be uncomfortable and painful,’ Mr Lickley added.

‘Miss Yeates would have found it difficult to breathe and you would have expected her to resist and struggle.’
