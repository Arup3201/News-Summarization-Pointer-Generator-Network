Dumped boyfriend Robbie Hayball (pictured) taunted his ex-lover on the phone as he plunged to his death in his van over a 350ft cliff

A dumped boyfriend taunted his ex-lover on the phone as he plunged to his death in his van over a 350ft cliff, an inquest heard today.

Chef Robbie Hayball, 20, left the line open so Shannon Woodford, 21, could hear his screams as he ploughed through a fence, and onto rocks below.

The father-of-two had taken his white van to the top of the beauty spot just minutes after she told him their four year relationship was over.

He then told her when she phoned: 'I'm glad you called, listen to this...'

Distraught Miss Woodford told the 
inquest: 'I heard a loud rustling sound, a loud scream and the phone 
made some more noises before going off.'

Mr Hayball died instantly as his van was smashed to pieces when it landed on the jagged rocks below.

Newport
Coroner's Court court heard Mr Hayball was devastated at living apart 
from his children during the couple's 'on-off' relationship.

He had stormed out of her flat into the night following a row in which he had become violent.

Miss Woodford told him it was over and she didn't want to see him again.

The full-time mother wept as she told the inquest, in Newport, Isle of Wight, about their last angry words to each other.

The couple had been on a 'date night' to see Taken 2 at the cinema in a bid to patch up their problems.

He
confessed he had mounting troubles, was staying on his mum's sofa, his 
car was broken, and without her and the kids he had 'nothing left to 
live for'.

Devastated Miss Woodford listened in 
terror to Mr Hayball's scream as he plummeted to his death off Culver 
Cliffs, Isle of Wight, at around 3am.

He ploughed through a barbed wire fence and onto the rocks below.

Miss
Woodford, who has a three-year-old son and two-year-old daughter, said:
'After Rob left he called me again and again trying to tell me he was 
sorry but I told him it was over.

'I told him I didn't want to see him again and that it was over.

'Then
he sent me a text saying "Give the kids a kiss goodbye. I hope you can 
live with yourself. It is for the best, goodnight x".

'I called him straight back and he said: "I am glad you called me so you can hear this, listen to this...'

'Then I heard him drive through the fence and over the cliff.

'I didn't know where he was - he had told me he was driving up 'a big hill'.

'Next I heard a loud rustling sound, a loud scream and the phone made some more noises before going off.'

Miss Woodford tried to ring again, but 
could not get through and dialled 999 to raise the alarm with police on 
October 11 last year.

Members of the H.M. Coastguard Search and Rescue team scanned the area where Mr Hayball died

Coastguards and the RNLI launched a search operation and Mr Hayball's white van was spotted submerged 5 feet beneath the waves at the base of the cliff.

Trackmarks were found at the top of the steep drop, in White Cliff Bay.

Pouring rain, strong winds and turbulent seas hampered efforts by two RNLI crews to reach the vehicle.

Specially trained teams winched down the cliff face to get close to it and saw the rear door of the van was swinging open.

Best friend Jack Fraser-Noble, leaving the court, said Mr Hayball didn't express his feelings very well

Mr Hayball's body was eventually found wedged under rocks and recovered, but his van was washed away.

A final text to friends and relatives at 2.38am had read: 'I am sorry but she has driven me insane.

'Thank you all but don't let my kids think that I was the one. It's her - pure poison.'

His grieving mother Yowapha Hayball, from Newport, sobbed during today's hearing and left as Isle of Wight Coroner Caroline Sumeray read out results of the post-mortem.

It revealed Mr Hayball died of multiple injuries following trauma. Tests showed he was nearly double the drink drive limit.

Miss Woodford said the pair had an 'on-off' relationship.

Mr Hayball's brother, Jason Hayball, 18, from Newport, said his brother had not seemed depressed when he saw him earlier that evening but he had felt under pressure.

Mr Hayball said: 'Everything added up to stress him out - his relationship, where to live, his kids and money.

'The stress of having to keep the relationship going because he had to see the kids got to him.'

Best friend Jack Fraser-Noble, 21, paid tribute to Mr Hayball, who had worked 60 hour weeks to support his family and renovated cars and motorbikes in his spare time.

Mr Fraser-Noble said: 'He didn't express his feelings very well, I think that was his downfall.

'I had no idea that things were so bad. He was a motivated person who wanted to get on in life.'

Recording an open verdict, Mrs Sumeray said: 'This was a young man saddled with children a lot earlier than he had intended in life.

'I have heard how he had ambitions and was a good chap, a good friend.

'I think his mind was clouded by fury and alcohol, distress and anger at all the stresses in his life.'

Loved ones have set up a shrine at the cliffs, regularly laying flowers at a cross in Mr Hayball's memory.
