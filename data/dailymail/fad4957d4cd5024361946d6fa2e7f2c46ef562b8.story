Public opinion against the Afghan War has topped discontent seen during even the darkest days of the Iraq War.

Almost 12 years into the conflict, 67 per cent of Americans responding to a recent poll agree that the war in Afghanistan hasn’t been worth fighting. Only 28 per cent of Americans believe the war was worth fighting, but an unexpected 53 per cent are against removing all troops from the country.

In short, acrimony towards the Afghan War now exceeds the most negative opinions seen against the Iraq War in 2007, during which almost 1,000 US soldiers died carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The two-thirds against the war based their beliefs on examining cost versus benefit, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. This sentiment tops the record 66 per cent of people polled by ABC News/Washington Post to be against the Iraq War in April 2007.

Also, unlike in Iraq, the US received overwhelming support invading Afghanistan from countries around the world, which stood in stark contrast to the opposition voiced against the US assault on Iraq led by France, Germany and the United Nations, the latter of which called the military action 'illegal' at the time.

Despite only 28 per cent of Americans responding to the poll believing that the war was worth fighting, a surprising 53 per cent are in favor of not removing all troops from Afghanistan, instead supporting the idea that some stay behind to train Afghan forces after the planned 2014 troop exodus.

With only 43 per cent of respondents believing the Afghan War has contributed to the long-term security of the United States, sentiment against the conflict is spread across most demographics. It is worth noting, though, that almost 60 per cent of Americans polled in June believed the war did contribute to the long-term security of the US – one month after Navy SEALS killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.

Essentially split on the issue, 51 per cent of Republicans believe the war isn’t worth fighting, according to the poll. An overwhelming 74 per cent of Democrats and 71 pe rcent of independents are also against the war.

The United States has seen the deaths of over 2,100 troops since the beginning of the Afghanistan War in 2001, according to military records. By comparison, over 4,400 US soldiers have died since the beginning of the Iraq War.
