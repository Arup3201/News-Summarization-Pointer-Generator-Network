Police have named a four-week-old baby who died on Boxing Day after it is believed he became trapped between a bed and a wall.

Emergency services were called to the family home in Blackpool on Friday around noon, where paramedics found the boy, who police named as Freddie Neil.

It is thought that the newborn was left to sleep on a bed but became trapped against a wall.

But despite being taken to the nearby Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Freddie could not be saved and he was pronounced dead.

Two people, a 33-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and child neglect, police in Lancashire said.

The pair have been bailed until June pending further inquiries.

Today neighbours on Rydal Avenue near the centre of the town, where the boy lived have told of their shock of seeing police cars and an ambulance race to the street on Boxing Day.

One neighbour, Mark Fulcher, 33, said: 'It's an absolute tragedy - it's no age that, four weeks.

'Your heart goes out to them. We’ve got four kids - aged one, five, 10 and 12 - and if it was one of mine I would be heartbroken.

'It is a real shame. I only found out because my daughter told me.'

Other neighbours in the street said the family, who have another child, tend to keep to themselves.

One, who asked not to be named, said Freddie’s father was 'doting'.

She added: 'I didn’t talk to them much but I looked after their other lad a couple of times.

'All my kids were out on Boxing Day and my daughter said there’s an ambulance outside.

'Within seconds the baby was brought out -it was quite fast.

'This street is full of children so this was a big shock.'

She said the father, who is understood to be a DJ in the area, followed his son to hospital in a friend’s car.

She added: 'He’s a fantastic dad, a real doting father.'

Another neighbour described his surprise at seeing the street taken over by police vehicles.

He said: 'When I came back from work there were two police cars and an ambulance on Friday.

'There have been crime scene investigators here too.

The baby boy, named by police as Freddie Neil, was taken to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital, pictured, but was later pronounced dead 

'The police have been camping out day and night outside the house - they come and go.

'We dont know what happened. We’re just waiting for more information.'

An inquest into the baby's death was due to take place today.

A spokesman for Lancashire Constabulary confirmed: 'Police in Blackpool have launched an investigation into the unexplained death of a four-week-old baby following a call to an address on Rydal Avenue by the Ambulance Service on Friday at around midday.

'The baby boy was taken by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead.

'Two people, a man aged 33 and a woman aged 30, both from Blackpool, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and child neglect and have been bailed until June.

'The coroner has been informed and a post mortem examination to establish the cause of death will take place in due course.'
