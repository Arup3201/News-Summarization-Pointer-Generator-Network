Poor performance by Network Rail is leading to thousands of extra cancellations and delays for millions of passengers as more than one in ten trains run late, rail watchdogs ruled today.

'Too many people are facing too many delays', said Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) chief executive Richard Price.

Train service performance is 'generally below expectations' said the watchdog in its assessment of Network Rail's performance for the period from April to October 2014. 

And the data that Network Rail relies upon to plan and manage works on the railways is often 'unreliable' and could be preventing it from hitting its targets, said the ORR.

The Office of Rail Regulation found Network Rail's poor performance led to thousands of extra delays and cancellations between April and October

Rail unions said Network Rail was 'failing millions of passengers.'

In the six months from April to October passengers faced 46,545 more late trains in England and Wales than had been expected or allowed for. 

In Scotland the figure was 2,730 more late trains than expected;

Across England and Wales there were 18,544 more trains cancelled or severely disrupted in than expected.

Punctuality levels at 89.1per cent are 0.7percentage points short of the level expected.

The watchdogs said Network Rail was making progress on its own two-year performance recovery plan but warned that this was not having the desired effect on punctuality.

Network Rail had also reported delivering less work than it planned to do, in both maintaining and renewing the network.

There was a lack of reliable data on bridges, structures and earthworks as well as volumes of work being delivered and this was having an adverse impact on Network Rail's ability to work effectively.

Rail unions said Network Rail is 'failing millions of passengers' despite massive investment

Failure to make sufficient progress on the early stages of some improvement work cast doubt on its its ability to deliver more ambitious enhancements.

Mr Price said: 'This is vital as too many people are facing too many delays. It is the biggest source of dissatisfaction with the railways, and the industry needs to tackle the problem'.

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'Despite massive investment by the taxpayer, £38billion over the next five years, Network Rail is failing millions of passengers, with more than 10per cent of services regularly running late. They need to up their game, especially when you take into account that those long-suffering passengers are paying the highest fares in Europe.'

Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: 'If the hundreds of millions of pounds bled from our railways by the vultures from the private train companies was invested back into infrastructure we would be able to modernise and expand our railways up to a level that could meet surging passenger demand.

'All the time that our rail network is seen as an open door to a fast buck by greedy speculators reliability and safety will take a back seat. The answer is to end two decades of profiteering and exploitation and return to an integrated and publicly-owned railway run in the public interest.'

Publishing its own review of its performance - covering April to September 2014 – Network Rail admitted its passenger train performance was 'behind plan'.

The company added: 'There are clear improvement strategies in place but these will take time to have an impact on Britain's network, which is seeing continued growth in passenger numbers.'

The watchdog said that some of the data Network Rail relies on to plan works on the railways is 'unreliable'

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne said: 'The railway continues to see strong growth in passenger numbers.

'However, we know that there are too many passengers that do not get the level of reliability they have a right to expect and that this has a real impact on their daily lives.'
