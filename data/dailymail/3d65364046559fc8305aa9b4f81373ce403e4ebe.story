Alan Cox, 47, said he was a 'latent homosexual' but admitted preying on girls while under the influence of drugs bought online

A man who dropped his trousers in front of two teenage girls told a court he was a 'latent homosexual' and blamed drugs he had bought off the internet for his actions.

Alan Cox, 47, from Nelson, Lancashire, said he had no recollection of running towards the girls shouting 'My pants are falling down' and said he may have been suffering a bipolar episode, Burnley Crown Court heard.

But the divorced father-of-three, who told police he had taken the legal high NRG-3 before the incident in Colne, Lancashire, admitted indecent exposure, breaching a ban on him contacting young girls, and possessing an indecent image of a child.

Cox, a convicted paedophile, was jailed for two years after the court heard that he had been released from jail three months before the incident on May 26 last year.

He was said to be in a psychotic state when he let himself into a house in Colne holding an armful of teddy bears, and claiming he was looking for his ex-wife.

He was fobbed off and left, but just after 10pm he drove three times past two girls aged 15 and 16 before stopping his BMW and running towards them, shouting 'My pants are falling down'.

The court heard that Cox, who was holding a piece of wire, let go of his trousers and they fell around his knees.  The girls fled to a nearby house and the father of one of them went out looking for Cox.

Robert Elias, prosecuting, said the father found Cox's car and let down two of its tyres to prevent him running away. 

Meanwhile, Cox leapt over a wall, landing near a railway line where police were investigating the death of a man who fell from a bridge.

Mr Elias said: 'He was behaving 
bizarrely, singing to himself. He was arrested on suspicion of murder 
and taken into custody.'

When
 questioned, Cox said he had run away from a police road block and had 
been sprinting for his life, his trousers fell down and he pulled them 
back up. He told officers he had taken NRG3, a legal high, bought over 
the internet, and it had made him paranoid.

Cox, who represented himself at Burnley Crown Court, said he was a 'latent homosexual' with no interest in women

The
 prosecutor said : 'It seems he was in a state where he was paranoid. He
 thought he was about to be shot. He doesn’t accept that the police 
murder inquiry was real.

'He thought that was some sort of persecution of
 him. He was also in a disinhibited state sexually.'

A psychiatrist said Cox struck while in a temporary, drug-induced psychotic state, caused by legal highs.

The court was told that he had also walked uninvited into a neighbour’s house with an armful of teddy bears.  After he was arrested, he was taken to a police station spent most of his time naked in his cell and carrying out sex acts.

At Burnley Crown Court, Lancashire, the father-of-three, from Nelson said he had no recollection of the offences but claimed it was 'highly improbable' they happened, as he was a 'latent homosexual'.

Cox, who represented himself in court and said he planned to return to his native New Zealand as soon as he could, added: 'I am not interested in women.'

When he was arrested, Cox said he had taken so-called 'legal highs' - drugs he had bought online (file image)

He said: 'I find the charges highly 
improbable and certainly implausible and it would appear there is a 
miscarriage of justice about to take place.

'I have no defence. I have no memory. The only defence I have is I was bipolar and having an episode at the time.'

He added: 'I was abused as a child by another man, which makes it even more implausible that I would do such a thing.'

Inquiries revealed Cox had been banned from contacting girls under 16 under an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) after being given 33 months' jail for assaulting a 12-year-old girl in 2010. He also had a caution for molesting a 15-year-old girl, the court heard.

Cox admitted breaching the SOPO, indecent exposure and possessing an indecent photo of a child and was jailed for two years on Friday.

He was ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life and will be banned from working with children indefinitely.

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said it was 'odd and disturbing' that the defendant had had some wire with him.

He told Cox: 'You have mentioned there would be a miscarriage of justice but you also indicate that you have no defence and you must understand that I have to sentence you on the basis of the facts as they have been outlined to me in court.'

'I sincerely hope that during the course of your remaining time in custody, and whilst on licence, that you will do intensive work to do with your background problem with drugs.'
