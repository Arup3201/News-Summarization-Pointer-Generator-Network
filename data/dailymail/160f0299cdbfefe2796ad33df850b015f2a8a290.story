A cash-strapped police force has revealed plans to allow advertisements on the side of squad cars.

Nottinghamshire Police yesterday unveiled the radical move, which could also see huge advertising billboards erected outside police stations.

The force have proposed the drastic measures as they look to cut £73.8 million from their budget by 2020.

If approved, local companies will be offered the chance to have their logo or slogan emblazoned across police vehicles for an agreed fee.

But yesterday the plans were labelled 
'barmy' by residents and former officers who fear it could demean the 
work of the force and leaving their vehicles looking like 'racing cars'.

Retired policeman Ray Egan, 76, said: 'It will make the police force a laughing stock if they start driving around with silly little logos on the side of the car.

'How are you supposed to enforce law and order if you've got a big McDonalds or Burger King logo across the side of the vehicle.

'It demeans the work of the force where the cars have not changed for decades and decades. I have never heard of anything like it in my life.

'This could open the floodgates this and police cars could end up looking more like racing cars. It's disgusting.

'There's much better ways of saving money than this. I would be sick as a parrot if I saw a police car going around plastered in advertisements.'

Local shopkeeper Nitish Singh, 29, added: 'People will lose respect for the police if they sell themselves out like this, it makes them look desperate. It just sounds barmy.

Chief Constable Chris Eyre said radical plans, which also include closing police stations, were being considered so the force could still concentrate on fighting crime.

He added: 'We are working to identify whether or not there are opportunities for sponsorship on vehicles.

'It is an option to have 'this vehicle is sponsored by' and then a dealership name.

'Where we have buildings in prominent places, if there are possible spaces for advertising hoardings - we have to look at it on a case-by-case basis.

'The more we do these things, the more we can protect our service to the public. The service we deliver is driving everything.'

Nottinghamshire Police Federation chairman Phil Matthews said they were being forced to 'think outside the box.'

He said: 'A few years ago we would have been horrified by the idea of advertising on police cars."But there is the acceptance that the money is not going to be there and if we can have this funding from a sponsor, we can keep going.'

A Notts Police spokeswoman added: 'The details of this are still in their infancy and it has been acknowledged that any sponsorship will require tight control by the force.'
