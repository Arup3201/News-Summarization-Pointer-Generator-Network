Pedestrians spotted this traffic warden in Shirley, West Midlands, parking in double yellow lines before issuing tickets to other drivers

Traffic wardens are known as sticklers for rules, ready to punish motorists for the slightest violation.

However, one warden in Shirley, West Midlands, has provoked outrage after parking on a double yellow line before walking off to issue tickets to other drivers.

Despite being challenged by pedestrians over his behaviour, the Solihull Council employee then climbed back into his unmarked car and drove off.

Witnesses say the man pulled on to the double yellow lines at around at around 8.50am yesterday. 

He spent the next 15 minutes waking around nearby streets, and handed out at least one parking ticket. 

Leon Kennedy, 31, was walking to work at the time and asked the traffic warden why he was parked on double yellow lines.

He said: 'I had to say something, but he seemed pretty unrepentant.

'He said "you wouldn’t be saying this if I was a police officer parked on double yellow lines".

'I told him that if they weren’t attending an emergency call then I definitely would be unhappy and besides he isn’t a police officer.

'But he just said he was doing his job and got in the car and drove off.

'What gives him the right to park illegally when everybody else gets punished by him for doing the same? It’s not on.'

Pedestrians Phil and Angela Hall, who were walking their dog at the time, said they could not believe their eyes. 

Phil, 60, said: 'We watched this car pull up on double yellow lines. 

'I went over to warn him to watch out as there’s lots of traffic wardens around here and then low and behold a traffic warden popped out.

Passerby Leon Kennedy, 31, challenged the official over his behaviour, but says the man told him he was only doing his job before getting into his car and driving away

Angela Hall, 58, branded the warden's actions 'hypocrisy' saying it 'does not send out a good message'

'I was just too stunned to say anything to him but he walked off and spent the next 15 minutes looking for illegally parked cars - while illegally parked himself.

'He issued a ticket to at least one other car as far as I could see, I don’t think it is right at all.'

Angela, 58, added: 'It’s just pure hypocrisy. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

'I know they have a job to do but surely they should work within the law themselves because it does not send out a good message at all.'

A Solihull Council spokesperson said: 'Civil Enforcement Officers are exempt from most parking restrictions while carrying out their duties.

'Parking on double yellow lines is included in this exemption. While officers will always seek alternative parking this is not always practicably possible.' 

However a council spokesman confirmed wardens are exempt from most parking rules while on duty, and that parking on a double yellow is included
