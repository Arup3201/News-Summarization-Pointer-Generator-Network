As a nurse, Lynne Runagham gave healthy eating advice on a daily basis.

But after tipping the scales at 18st 7lb and barely being able to squeeze into a size 20 dress, she realised she needed to take some of her own advice.

Mother-of-two Lynne Runaghan, 45, shed six stone after being diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) - a condition which can lead to diabetes and even heart disease.

Lynne gave healthy advice for a living but then decided is was time to listen to herself

Lynne Runaghan, 45, shifted six stone and dropped from a size 20 to a 12

The occupational health nurse from Birmingham, West Midlands, tipped the scales at 18st 7Ib and was squeezing into a size 20 dress at her heaviest.

Super-size Lynne scoffed huge meals at all hours of the day and night - gorging on her children’s food and eating huge portion sizes while working around night shifts.

But after embarking on a strict exercise regime, she’s shed inches off her waist - and as her cankles disappeared she even went down a shoe size.

Lynne said: 'I ballooned from a size 12 after having my children and I was tired, lethargic and miserable.

'I couldn’t wear pretty tops because my waist disappeared and I hated the way I looked.

'I was studying for a degree and a diploma and spent all my spare time working on assignments so the weight piled on.'

After
being diagnosed with IGT, Lynne went for a walk up a hill with her 
husband, Dave, on New Year’s Day 2010 and struggled to get to the top.

'I knew it was time to turn my life around - I couldn’t go on like this,' she said.

Lynne tried diet after diet to shift the 
excess weight, and would often eat next to nothing in an effort to slim 
down - including replacing meals with health bars and shakes.

Lynne is now addicted to cycling and rides up to 20 miles a day

Then she came across the Rosemary Conley diet - swapping takeaways and chocolate for chicken or fish and lots of veg, eating more than ever before.

This combined healthy well-balanced eating with exercise classes to help kick-start the metabolism and reduce calorie intake.

Lynne lost 8Ibs in just one week.

She said: 'I felt so full, I could barely manage all 600 calories because I’d eaten so little the day before.

'I was eating the right things - lots of vegetables and salad.

'After two weeks I went on to a regulated diet and found I was so motivated I didn’t want to cheat.'

Dave was very supportive and would make Lynne’s meals for her - losing three stones himself by following a similar diet.

Lynne has lost weight by eating more, but with a greater focus on healthy food like meat, salad and vegetables

After losing a stone in just three weeks, Lynne took up cycling - something she now does for up to 20 miles a day.

Lynne said: 'I'm totally addicted to cycling - I go to and from work on my bike in all weathers. I always ride at least ten miles a day, even in the rain and snow.'

Lynne wasn't happy when she was larger but now she can shop wherever she likes

Since then, Lynne has dropped to a size ten clothes and weighs just 12 1/2 stone, meaning she can shop wherever she likes.

She said: 'It’s been great working my way down the jeans sizes - it’s so motivating.

'Before I would just wear dark things to hide my shape which were fuddy-duddy - I wouldn’t go near a dress.

'I used to hate shopping as I couldn’t never find anything nice to wear for special occasions.

'Most of my friends are slim so I always felt like the odd one out and used to get really depressed.

'People never give you the same amount of attention when you’re overweight, they judge you by your weight rather than your personality.'

Lynne has even managed to drop a shoe size after literally losing weight all over her body, making shopping for her feet just as fun now she is able to slip into a size eight shoe.

Lynne said: 'I’ve got my tiny waist back and can’t believe I let myself get that big.

'My children always loved me no matter what I looked like and my husband fell in love with me at a size 16, but I think he likes the new me.'

Now a new woman with bags of energy, Lynne is able to play an active part in her sons Callum, 19, and Euan’s, 13, lives, and spur other women like herself to lose weight.

Lynne said: 'I use my weight loss as a tool to inspire others to lose weight.

'My job involves giving health information to schools and employers and it feels so much better to have some real experience to back what I’m saying up.

'I learnt some things myself - how easter eggs are literally all fat and how much sugar is in wine - that alone keep me from my worst habits!

'Someone told me I was their incentive to lose weight - and that feels really good.

'I’m not tired and aching all the time anymore either - and I’m eating more than I used to!'
