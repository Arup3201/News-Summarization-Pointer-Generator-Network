Murdered: Kellye Taylor, 53, was a teacher at Huntington Academy, a private elementary school, located across from the park where she was stabbed

'She loved children, and she loved being around children. She loved teaching children, and that's what she did,' said Vanessa Kelly, the victim's sister.

Police say Taylor was sitting in a park across the street from the school around 1:30 p.m. watching her students play when a man suddenly walked up and stabbed her in front of the children.

'She was sitting inside of a folding chair, just inside of that concrete bench, when the suspect came up from behind and stabbed her,' said Sgt. Aaron Eaton with the Long Beach Police Department.

When officers arrived, they found an adult female with a stab wound to the upper body.

Witnesses pointed out the suspect and
police captured him a few blocks from the park. He has been identified 
as 50-year-old Steven Brown.

Police said Brown was the father of Taylor’s grandchildren.

Loved children: Kellye taught Kindergarten through Sixth Grade. She was killed in Orizaba Park in Long Beach in front of her students

'The suspect did not at any time try to approach the children, attack them or do anything with them,' said Eaton.

Family
members say Taylor had custody of the four grandchildren from her 
daughter's relationship with Brown. Relatives say they want justice for 
Taylor.

'I don't know why he did what he did,' said Kelly.

Long Beach police say the motive for the murder remains under investigation.
