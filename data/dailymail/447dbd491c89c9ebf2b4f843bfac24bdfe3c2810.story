A woman found murdered at the Hong Kong apartment of British 'psycho banker' Rurik Jutting sent a message  saying she wanted to 'get out of here' just minutes before her death at the luxury complex.

Seneng Mujiasih, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1.

At 3.45am police found Ms Mujiasih dying in the apartment with her throat slashed and knife wounds to her buttocks. They later discovered the mutilated corpse of another Indonesian sex worker, 25-year-old Sumatra Ningsih on Jutting's balcony, having been stuffed into a suitcase five days earlier.

Yesterday Jutting, 29 - who  reportedly earned £350,00 a year as a banker - was pictured chuckling to himself in the back of a prison van after being sent for psychiatric tests to determine whether he is fit to stand trial, having appeared at a hearing earlier in the day charged with double murder.

Desperate: Seneng Mujiasih, who was also known as Jesse Lorena, is understood to have sent a text to a friend complaining of a 'really bad' smell inside the flat at 3.25am on Saturday November 1

Ms Mujiasih was found dying with her throat slashed on the sitting room floor of Jutting's apartment at 3.45am,  Hong Kong police have revealed.

Just 20 minutes earlier she had texted a friend to raise concerns over her visit, saying: 'Something smells really bad – I want to get out of here,' according to The Telegraph, who quoted a source close to the victim who asked not to be named.

According to witnesses, Ms Mujiasih met Jutting at the nearby New Makati Pub & Disco sometime after 1.35am. Security footage shows the pair walking in the direction of his apartment shortly after 2.15am but what happened between their arrival and Ms Mujiasih's death remains a mystery.

Although it remains unclear exactly why Ms Mujiasih wanted to leave the flat and what the 'really bad' smell was, other residents in the building are said to have complained of a 'dead animal' stench in the building's corridors. They were later told the smell was from the first victim's decomposing body.

Yesterday, Jutting was today sent for psychiatric tests to determine if he is fit to stand trial for the murders of the two Indonesian prostitutes.

The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out and the banker was remanded in custody.

Relaxed: The judge adjourned proceedings for two weeks while the psychiatric assessments are carried out

As he left court yesterday, Jutting was pictured chuckling in the back of a prison van surrounded by security guards wearing face masks.

His lawyer, who did not speak during the hearing, said he had not yet agreed to take part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, but did not rule out giving consent in future.

Jutting, bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, remained impassive during the brief hearing at the Eastern Magistrate's court - his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago.

He spoke only once to say 'I do' when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements. 

The case was 'adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead', said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai.

Reports by two different doctors are required under Hong Kong law, said prosecutor Louise Wong who confirmed Jutting is being held at the maximum-security Siu Lam psychiatric centre.

He will next appear in court on November 24.

Following the hearing, Hong Kong solicitor Michael Vidler, who is also acting in Jutting's defence, said it could be months before a plea is entered. 

Sumarti Ningsih, 23, was found dead in a suitcase at Cambridge-educated Jutting's apartment in the former British colony's Wan Chai district earlier this month.

Police had been called to the property on Halloween night and first found 29-year-old Seneng Mujiasih with wounds to her throat and buttocks. She died a short time later.

Jutting moved to Hong Kong from London in July last year and is understood to have quit his highly-paid job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in the days before the incident.  

Before leaving, he appeared to have set a sinister out of office automatic response for his email account at the bank.

'I am out of the office. Indefinitely. For urgent enquiries, or indeed any enquiries, please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath. For escalation please contact God, though suspect the devil will have custody (Last line only really worked if I had followed through),' the email read. 

Victim: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after

Grief: Jumiati, a cousin of Sumarti Ningsih, breaks down in tears as she holds her relative's photograph during a vigil to demand justice for the two murdered sex workers

More than 100 people attended a vigil for the two victims today, where many called for 'justice' for the women

His appearance in court yesterday came after an Indonesian nanny claimed she was allegedly invited back to his flat prior to the killings, but turned down his offer because she thought he was 'acting strangely'.

The former public schoolboy was arrested after calling police to his £2,000-a-month high-rise flat following a night out at the Makati Pub & Disco.

It was at the nightclub prior to his arrest that he reportedly began chatting to the mother-of-three, who has lived in the former British colony for four years and works as a nanny for a Hong Kong Chinese family.

She claimed he approached her and a friend at the bar and said: 'Hi, girls. Where are you from? How old are you?' before buying them a round of drinks.

After just minutes of chatting, he allegedly asked the nanny to return to his apartment with him but she said she denied his request because of his 'strange' behaviour. 

The woman, who is believed to be in her 30s, said she had witnessed Jutting pacing the club, occasionally grabbing women, before he approached her.

Prior to his arrest, Jutting, who studied at Cambridge University, sent a message to his former girlfriend of six months, Ariane Guarin (pictured together above), asking her to fly over to Hong Kong to visit him for a week

Yesterday Ms Ningsih's cousin, Jumiati, said at the vigil that she had last seen her relative in August in their home village in Indonesia.

Jumiati, who goes by only one name, said she called police about a week ago to report that her cousin was missing and was later asked to identify her body.

'I hope the killer will be punished and will feel the same as what has been done to my cousin,' she said at the vigil.

Susiati, a friend of the victim, broke down in tears as she remembered Ms Ningsih, who had a five-year-old son back home.

'I have lost my best friend, and I am devastated,' she said.

Several in the crowd held signs demanding reforms to Hong Kong and Indonesian laws governing how domestic workers can find work and how long they can stay in the city.
