A photographer has delved into the decaying bowels of the New York subway system and emerged with incredible shots of its abandoned tunnels.

Gregory Berg, 21, was enticed by the Metro Transit Authority's empty stations and now regularly walks across live tracks to take his stunning glimpses of underground Gotham.

The subway's third rail famously carries 625 volts of electricity and touching it means likely death for New Yorkers who don't listen to announcements reminding passengers 'do not go on to the tracks for any reason'.

''Death is a serious option down there,' Mr Berg told Daily Mail Online. 

However, he prefers taking risks in the subway's less crowded corners  to safely riding along in  busy cars and has been venturing down to the system's unseen parts for two years.

The urban spelunker said that his favorite type of shot is where trains create a blur of light as they go past empty stations like the one above

Some abandoned platforms, such as the unused area underneath 42nd street's ACE train stop, are within earshot of conversations happening at active stations

The urban photographer, who grew up in Manhattan and New Jersey, would not disclose how he reaches the abandoned platforms, though doing so often requires going on to live in-use tracks where speeding trains come every couple of minutes.

His destinations are often within earshot of active stations, and he said that he can hear conversations on the 42nd street ACE platform when he is on an unused platform directly below it.

Other spots are only reached by long walks on tracks underground. 

He acknowledged that what he does is 'very illegal' and said that he would never go shoot the tunnels without friends. 

Mr Berg first met up with a group of underground photographers when he was 19 after seeing one of their pictures on Instagram. 

His father was a model train enthusiast and now trains continue to be part of his life as he goes around the city with friends such as James Lanning. 

The snappers regularly receive requests to help hopeful urban explorers reach hidden spots of the subway, which Mr Berg calls 'the bando,' but doesn't offer help to those who don't know what they are doing and seriously hurt themselves.

The skilled snapper said that while he may one day shoot commercial photography, though right now he is just focused on sharing his experiences in New York

The photographer said that visitors to the subway tunnels can emerge with their hands and teeth covered in dirt despite not having touched anything

The photographer is not interested in Internet fame, but uses his Instagram as a means of sharing his photos with like-minded people and creators

There is also 'another world' of graffiti artists and urban explorers who use the same tunnels for adventure, though some do not like photographers sharing photos of their secret spots

He has also had close encounters with workers in the subway, and one time narrowly escaped an abandoned platform before an employee with a flashlight called over a group of his coworkers to the spot Mr Berg had been minutes before.

Beyond the dreaded third rail and police, there is always the threat of an approaching train in stations that cars still run through without stopping.

He  said that fear of the subway's scarier side is 'only mental'.

'The senses are always raised; listening for trains, inhaling the scents of the city, the brain works fast and unimpeded,' he shared on Instagram.

Mr Berg, who was homeless four years ago and is now sober after recovering from addiction, said that the adventures and the thrill he gets from his underground photography 'saved his life'. 

His website houses mementos his bravery, including many shots looking down the barrel of tunnels from which trains will shortly emerge.

He said that people, especially New Yorkers, need to see a different side of their city. 

'I just want to share my wild experiences with the world, and captivate the city with some truly great people-something photography is perfectly suited for.' 

Catching blurs of light from passing trains is his favorite type of shot. He said that he is in no rush to make more money by doing commercial photography, even though he has received offers to shoot weddings that could be lucrative.

For now Mr Berg continues with the less glamorous realities of what he calls his job.

He said that the subways were 'the dirtiest place you've ever been,' with the constant possibility of stepping on dead rats and more live rodents than you could imagine from looking at the critters scurrying around on active tracks.  

Mr Berg hopes his work lets New Yorkers, and people at large through social media such as Instagram, see a different side to the metropolis

Some hidden parts of the New York City subway system, which has been operating for more than a century, are only reached by long walks

Mr Berg said that his 'brain works fast and unimpeded' when he is down on the tracks and that the fear of oncoming trains or electric shock is 'only mental'

The 21-year-old has had close encounters with getting caught after workers with flashlights suspected that someone was up to 'very illegal' activity

The tunnels are stifling hot in the summer and can become cold in the winter, though they are always capable get visitors dirty even without them touching anything.

Often his hands and white smile are tainted black by dirt when he emerges after a night of shooting, often in the early hours of the morning.  

When people hear about Mr Berg's photos they often ask if he has seen the 'mole people' who live in the tunnels,  though he doesn't believe they exist.

The strangest thing he has ever seen in the train system's death is a hole in the wall that spurts out water, but will suddenly fire out 500 cigarette butts in repeated intervals. 

His expertise with the subway has led more than 5,000 users to follow him on Instagram, but he says that the social network is an outlet to express himself and meet others with similar vision rather than achieving Internet fame.

He is drawn to the underground because it is 'truly beautiful down there' and that his work has completely changed the way he feels when he rides the subway normally.

Mr Berg often rides between subway cars (also very dangerous and illegal) to find unused tracks that will lead to more hidden underground gems. 

New York City's subway has dozens of closed stations and platforms in addition to more than 400 active ones.

The most famous abandoned station is the former City Hall stop in lower Manhattan, Mr Berg's favorite. 

It was designed by architects Heins & Lafarge and still boasts the tiled archways and chandeliers it had before it was closed at the end of 1945, and very few have gotten to see its beauty up close since.

The station sometimes has tours where it is lit up, but Mr Berg prefers to shoot as it is, with minimal light and the blur of passing by with hundreds of unsuspecting passengers who will soon take the stairs back to the world at street level.

While Mr Berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up, he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground.

'You would never believe what's right below you're feet,' he said.

The New York City subway has more than 400 active stations, but there are more that have fallen out of use since the system began in the early 20th century
