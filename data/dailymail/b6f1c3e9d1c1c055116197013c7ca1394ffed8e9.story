Parking your car in a tight space is usually something to be proud of - but perhaps not in this case.

Extraordinary pictures taken this morning show how a black Seat Leon Cupra ended up crashing through the window of a basement flat after breaking through a fence and nose-diving off a ledge.

The car is thought to have slid on the icy road after a collision and amazingly the male driver escaped without serious injury.

Tight spot: The black Seat Leon Cupra crashed into the windows of a basement flat after sliding off the road in north Edinburgh

Photos show police and fire and rescue teams attending the frosty scene, which was cordoned off, on Saxe Coburg Street, north Edinburgh early this morning.

After a delay of several hours, the vehicle was finally  removed from its precarious position in the early afternoon and police say they are not investigating any wrongdoing.

A police spokesman said: 'The crash happened around 6.50am this morning. 

'It seems as if the car has left the road and gone in the garden area. A couple of windows have been broken in the flat but that seems to be the only damage.
