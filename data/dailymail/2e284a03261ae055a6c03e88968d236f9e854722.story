The brother of one of Lee Rigby's murderers said today that the decision to give his sibling a whole life prison sentence was Islamophobic.

Jeremiah Adebolajo believes Michael Adebolajo should not be forced to die behind bars and claims the judge in his Old Bailey trial caved in to 'pressure' after 'gave the public what they wanted'.

Last month Adebolajo, 29, was given a 
whole-life term, while Michael Adebowale, 22, was jailed for life with a
 minimum of 45 years.

Adebolajo was given the longest possible sentence because the judge believed he had no hope of rehabilitation, but his brother said today if released he would 'pose no danger to the public' and 'lead a very productive life were he to be released'.

Defence: Michael Adebolajo described himself as a 'soldier of Allah' and attempted to decapitate 
Drummer Rigby, but his brother Jeremiah, right, says his whole life sentence was Islamophobic

Brave life lost: Lee Rigby was walking innocently along a Woolwich road towards his barracks when he was run down and butchered

The
 British-born extremists mowed down Fusilier Rigby in a car before 
hacking him to death in the street in front of horrified onlookers near 
Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May last year.

Accomplice: Michael Adebowale was jailed for life with a minimum of 45 years - meaning he could be back on the streets by the age of 67

They
 both claimed that they were ‘soldiers of Allah’ and were motivated by 
the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing, and have shown no
 remorse.

Today Jeremiah Adebolajo, who like his brother is a Muslim convert, told the BBC Radio 5 Live today that his sibling was unfairly treated.

He pointed to the sentencing of Pavlo Lapshyn, who was jailed for 40 years for killing a man and planning to bomb three mosques to start a 'race war' in Britain.

'It
 seems strange to me that a man can be sentence to (whole) life for the 
death of one man and another can be sentenced to 40 years for the death 
of one and the attempted murder of many others,' he told Victoria Derbyshire.

'I wonder what the difference is here, aside from the guilty plea, aside from that I see that someone has died in both cases.

'It
 seems strange that Justice Sweeney can suggest there is no prospect of 
rehabilitation for my brother but there is for the Ukrainian man who 
openly stated he wanted to start a race war

'Yes
 (it is Islamophobic). Not only that I think it was trial by the public.
 There was a lot of public outrage, as could be understood. The death of
 a soldier in any country would provoke that, but I would suggest that 
Justice Sweeney was giving in to that pressure'.

During their sentencing last month violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge 
and fighting with prison guards.

Anger: The BBC has received criticism for allowing his brother on the air in the first place

Fight: During Adebolajo and Adebowale's sentencing, violence broke out in the Old Bailey dock and the killers began hurling abuse at the judge and fighting with prison guards. Above, a court sketch of the violence

Taken away head first: Mr Justice Sweeney was forced to sentence the men in their absence after they were bundled out of the courtroom following their violent outburst

In extraordinary 
scenes, the two Muslim extremists yelled 'Allahu Akbar' and 'You 
(Britain) and America will never be safe' during their sentencing at the
 court in Central London.

Shocking: A blood-drenched Michael Adebolajo (pictured) told witnesses in a video his attack on Drummer Rigby was an act of revenge - 'an eye for an eye'

Justice Sweeney was forced to jail them while they banged on the ceilings of their cells below the courtroom.

The judge said the pair's behaviour was ‘sickening and pitiless’, and that Adebolajo had no hope of rehabilitation.

‘Your sickening and pitiless conduct was 
in stark contrast to the compassion and bravery shown by the various 
women at the scene who tended to Lee Rigby's body and challenged what 
you had done and said.’

Jeremiah Adebolajo also said his brother should not have been tried for murder.

'Lee Rigby was performing a public service. It would have been more fitting, I think, that my brother, a British citizen, be charged with treason for killing a soldier. It is the first time that a man has killed another man and been sentenced to a whole life tariff,' he said.

When asked if he should one day be released he said: 'I believe my brother would lead a very productive life were he to be released. Were he to be rehabilitated I think he would lead a productive life – I think it’s important not to forget that he has young children himself.'

Victoria Derbyshire also asked him if he had sympathy for Lee Rigby's family, but would only be drawn on his son Jack.

'I
 have a tremendous amount of sympathy towards the son of Lee Rigby who will 
grow up without a father, and I think my brother does too'.

The BBC defended the interview today.

'All interviews broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live are carefully considered,' a spokesman said.

'We decided this interview, which was robust and challenging throughout and let listeners hear for the first time the reaction of Michael Adebolajo’s family to his sentencing, was in the public interest'.

Demand for justice: The bereft family of Lee Rigby wore t-shirts in his honour on the day his killers were sentence (Left to right) Stepfather Ian Rigby, his mother Lyn Rigby and sisters Sara McClure and Chelsea Rigby walked into the Old Bailey together

Moving: The only son of Lee Rigby, Jack, holds the hands of the loved-ones as he attended his father's funeral in July. His mother Rebecca told Justice Sweeney that he will grow up to see images of his father' horrific murder

Adebolajo is already appealing his conviction on technical legal grounds, using public funds to pay his legal fees.

His QC told the court that sentencing his client to life without parole 
would make him a 'martyr', while Adebowale's legal team said a 
whole-life term would be 'inhuman' for a man that age.

During their trial, Rigby's bereft 
family were forced to watch footage and hear gruesome accounts of 
the soldier being run down at 40mph and hacked to death in the street.

The jury, who were all offered 
counselling, took just 90 minutes to find the killers guilty of the fusilier’s 
murder, but not guilty of the attempted murder of police.

Jeremiah Adebolajo concentrated on the case of Ukrainian white supremacist Pavlo Lapshyn, 25, who murdered a Muslim pensioner and bombed three mosques as he waged a one-man race war in Britain.

Just
 five days after arriving in the country last year he killed 
Mohammed Saleem by stabbing him three times from behind as the 
82-year-old made his way home from evening prayers.

The
 ‘evil and calculating’ PhD student – who once posed with the British 
Ambassador when he was awarded the chance to work in Britain – also 
ordered bomb-making materials online as he plotted mass murder in a 
series of mosque attacks.

Guilty: Ukrainian born Pavlo Lapshyn admitted the
 murder of Mohammed Saleem, 82, who he stabbed as he walked home from a 
mosque, and also planting a series of bombs outside mosques

Horrifying: Nails recovered from the scene of one of three bombings planned by murderer Pavlo Lapshyn

Crazed: Pavlo Lapshyn catches a bus from Birmingham to Walsall calmly carrying a home made bomb in this green bag - incredible nobody was killed in the three bombings he planned

Lapshyn also admitted causing an explosion on 
July 12 near the Kanzal Iman mosque in Tipton, and engaging in conduct 
in preparation of terrorist acts between April 24 and July 18 this year.

This
 included planting bombs near mosques in Walsall and Wolverhampton, 
researching locations to plant bombs and buying chemicals on the 
internet to make explosives.
