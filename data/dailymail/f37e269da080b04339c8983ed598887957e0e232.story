Two teenagers were suspended from  school for three days because of their 'exaggerated' hair styles.

Abby Huxley, 14, and her friend Courtney Redfern, 15, were sent home from Samworth Academy in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire after staff said their ‘teddy boy’-style appearance was against school rules.

But Abby’s furious mother, Paula Selby, has condemned the school for telling the girls they could be made to sit in isolation as a punishment, pointing out that her daughter and Courtney are in the middle of studying for their GCSEs.

Styles: Abby Huxley 14 (right) and Courtney Redfern 15 (left) were suspended from Samworth Academy in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, for three days

She said: 'We tried to flatten it down and make it more discreet, but the school was still not happy.

'Nobody who has seen it can understand what the problem is, and have said there are boys walking around with this type of hairstyle.

'There seems to be a trend going on and the school is obviously not happy about it, Abby seems to have been picked up first about it.

'We have always supported the school in whatever punishment they might wish to give to Abby, but we are not supporting them on this one.'

Anger: Abby's mother, Paula Selby (centre), condemned the school for sending her daughter home and said boys were walking round in the same styles

Samworth Academy said it would not comment on individual cases, however, they referred to a policy on their website .

A spokesman added: 'We communicate our expectations regularly and every effort is made to provide ample opportunity to resolve any issues that arise.

'If however we find that the situation is not remedied after meetings with the student and their family, we may, as a last resort, impose a more serious sanction which could mean a fixed term exclusion.'

Response: Staff at the school would not comment on the cases but said they 'provide ample opportunity to resolve any issue that arises'

Row: Mrs Selby added the pair's haircut was part of a 'trend' which the school 'did not seem happy about'
