Police are hunting for a gunman after a man was shot dead on a rural road just two hours into 2015.

A murder investigation has been launched after the 36-year-old man was fatally injured close to a travellers' site in Burwell, Cambridgeshire.

Pictures from the scene today show a forensics tent covering the victim's body and a white van mysteriously abandoned in a ditch. 

A second man - also caught up in the New Year's Day row - was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge with severe facial injuries. He is in a stable condition and was not shot.
