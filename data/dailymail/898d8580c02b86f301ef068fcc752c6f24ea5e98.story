Putting down the box she had been carrying, Marion Brown leaned against a wall and took a deep breath.

She'd walked only 500 yards from the car to her daughter Jill's beauty salon, but the effort had left her gasping as if she'd ran up a hill.

She thought it was her asthma playing up. 'I'd been diagnosed with it years before and, although I didn't need to use my inhaler often, it occasionally flared up when I was walking uphill or for long distances, or carrying something heavy,' says Marion, 62, a retired district nurse who lives with her husband Kevin, 61, a retired engineering company director, in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.

Marion Brown, 62, from Gateshead, had her asthma checked out - and it turned out she had cencer

'When she saw how out of breath I was, Jill begged me to get it checked out, but I brushed off her concerns. I wasn't feeling at all unwell and had no other symptoms. But days later, when I was still getting breathless, I decided to follow her advice. I thought I'd get a new inhaler and that would be that.'

Marion saw a young GP, instead of her usual doctor, who noted that she hadn't had her asthma investigated properly for some time, and sent her for a chest X-ray. It was a decision that probably saved Marion's life.

Just over a week later, she had an X-ray at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead - this revealed a small, opaque shadow on her right lung. 'The doctors thought it was scarring from an old infection, so they decided to leave it for four weeks to see if it would repair itself,' says Marion.

But when she returned for the follow-up X-ray in February 2010, the shadow was still there. 'The consultant turned to me and said I'd have to see someone else. My heart sank - I had enough knowledge from my time as a district nurse to know the outlook wasn't good.'

Within a week, Marion was back in hospital with Kevin to be told it might be cancer. 'But I didn't believe it could be. I felt too well for that,' she says.

Indeed, her scans and a biopsy came back clear. 'Thankfully, the consultant knew that it couldn't be nothing and he didn't want to send me away without investigating further,' she says.

The retired district nurse hadn't smoked for years

A second biopsy found some suspicious cells on Marion's lung, and she was told she'd need surgery to remove them. Three weeks later, she had a lobectomy to remove the top segment of her right lung.

'As I walked into the consultant's office for the results, he took one look at me and asked why there was no one with me,' says Marion. 'I'd done such a good job of convincing myself it wouldn't be cancer that I'd decided it would be OK to go alone.' But then the consultant told Marion he'd removed a small - 3.7 cm - cancer 'which would probably buy me another five years'.

'I was devastated. I just couldn't believe it. I'd always thought of lung cancer as a heavy-smoking, old-man's disease.

'Years before, I'd been a social smoker, only smoking the odd cigarette when out with friends. In times of stress, I'd smoke a bit more, but I'd never have more than ten in any one day. Some days, I wouldn't have any at all. But when I was diagnosed with cancer, I hadn't actually smoked for ten years, because it had started to bring on my asthma. I just didn't think lung cancer would ever affect me.'

Marion is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease - in the UK, the number affected has risen by 13 per cent over the past decade, according to Cancer Research UK. This year, death rates from lung cancer among European women are set to overtake those for breast cancer, according to a study of cancer rates in 28 EU countries published last week.

Researchers from the University of Milan, who carried out the study, say the trend is largely due to women in the UK and their long history of smoking. But cancer experts are quick to point out that occasional smokers and even non-smokers are also at risk.

Ian Hunt, a consultant thoracic surgeon at St George's Hospital in Tooting, says: 'Decades ago, we saw a rise in more women smoking. While in recent years that number has decreased, particularly among middle-aged women, smoking among young women is still quite prevalent.'

Another change is in the type of cigarettes people smoke. When Marion did smoke, she tended to choose extra-mild, low-tar varieties. Mr Hunt says: 'Many people, especially women, have moved on to low-tar cigarettes in the mistaken belief they're better for them - but there is some evidence to suggest that people inhale these more deeply than they would a stronger cigarette in order to get the same effects. This has led to a change in the types of cancer we now see.'

The two types of lung cancer most often seen in the UK are squamous cell carcinoma (usually found in the centre of the lung) and adenocarcinoma (the type diagnosed in Marion, and often found in the outer areas of the lungs).

Marion is one of a growing number of women being diagnosed with the disease

In recent years, surgeons like Mr Hunt have seen a rise in adenocarcinoma, which is the most common lung cancer in women - possibly as they inhale low-tar cigarettes more deeply - and in non-smokers, though experts are unclear why.

'People think of lung cancer as a smoker's disease and there's this idea that if you stop smoking, your risk of lung cancer somehow decreases back to the level of someone who never smoked at all.

'In fact, that doesn't happen. It's simply not true to assume that risk is eliminated once you stop smoking.' Nor is it simply that heavy smokers are most at risk. 'The truth is, we just don't know why some people smoke heavily for years and never get lung cancer, while some occasional smokers do.'

Unfortunately, as Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery at King's College London, says, too often lung cancer is detected only once it's spread.

While this is true for both men and women, it doesn't help women's diagnosis that the traditional image of a lung cancer patient is the older man. 'The fact is, we are seeing more women in their 40s or 50s who've smoked 20 cigarettes a day since the ages of 13 and 15,' says Professor Lang-Lazdunski.

'Their tumours are generally peripheral adenocarcinomas on the outer edges of the lungs, small and aggressive, which spread rapidly.'

These are treatable with surgery, followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, if caught early enough. But too often, women ignore symptoms like a bad cough or breathlessness, or attribute them to something else, only seeing a doctor once the cancer has spread.

The official advice is to see a GP if you've had a persistent cough for three weeks, feel breathless, or start to cough up blood. The good news is that advances in medicine are making certain types of lung cancer more treatable.

After surgery, Marion underwent chemotherapy and, in April, she will have been in remission for five years

Professor Lang-Lazdunski says: 'We know that in the European population, about 15 per cent of female lung cancer patients who have never smoked have a particular gene mutation that makes them more susceptible to developing lung cancer. The EGFR, or epidermal growth factor receptor, mutation is virtually exclusively found in adenocarcinomas.'

Patients with this mutation show an impressive response to newly developed drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which bind to the surface of cancer cells to stop them growing and dividing, says Professor Lang-Lazdunski.

He adds: 'Large studies have found survival and quality of life to be better in patients carrying those mutations when using the new drugs versus intravenous chemotherapy, no matter what stage their cancer is at, and patients with advanced-stage cancer are now routinely tested for the mutation.'

After surgery, Marion underwent chemotherapy and, in April, she will have been in remission for five years. She now tries to live her life to the full and is the picture of health.

'When I tell people that I had lung cancer, they don't believe me,' she says. 'Like me, they thought lung cancer only affected older men.

'I want everyone to be aware that anyone is susceptible and to know the symptoms - even if they have just one, like I did.

'Thanks to my daughter and that young GP, my cancer was detected early enough to give me a fighting chance. Without that, I may not have lived to feel as lucky as I do.'
