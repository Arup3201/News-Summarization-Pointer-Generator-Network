26-year-old Timothy Turner Jr., of Waterbury, was arrested after a 22-year-old woman called authorities claiming he raped her

A Connecticut man has been charged with raping a Massachusetts woman he met on a dating app.

New Haven police say they arrested 26-year-old Timothy Turner Jr., of Waterbury, early Monday after the 22-year-old woman called authorities.

Officials allege the woman met Turner on the dating app Tagged and invited her to a multifamily home where one of his relatives lives. 

The woman says Turner pulled a gun on her and raped her on the second-floor landing.

The Hartford Courant reports that officer who later went to the home spotted Turner and said he matched the description of the assailant.

Turner allegedly opened the door of a third floor room only to immediately shut it upon seeing the officers. 

Turner was charged with aggravated first-degree sexual assault and other crimes.

Turner is being held on bail and wasn't immediately available to comment on the charges.

It's not clear if he has a lawyer.

Police warned dating app users to be cautious and to not meet strangers in private, unfamiliar locations.

Police said that these types of assaults will become more common as use of dating apps rises

'This is something people need to be aware of, and be careful of,' David Hartman of New Haven police told WTNH. 

'There has got to be great scrutiny by people using such an app or an online dating site.'
