A one bedroom apartment has hit the New York City market for a whopping $120,000.

Backing up its steep price tag, the rental boasts an unbeatable location inside the luxurious Pierre hotel on East 61st Street--the same building where a six bedroom was recently offered for $500K monthly.

But before you balk at such excess: the 1,100-square-foot apartment comes with butler service, a chauffeur-driven Jaguar 

'This is the epitome of luxury,' Town Residential broker Andres Perea-Garzon told the New York Daily News. 'Not only will you enjoy sweeping park and city views from a corner suite perched above the world, you have access to the finest services available.'

Hefty price tag: This 1,100-square-foot, one bedroom apartment has hit the rental market in Manhattan for a shocking $120,000 per month

Gorgeous: Renting the East 61st Street pad for a year would cost an unbelievable $1.44 million, but it comes with some seriously slick amenities

Good life: Located in the posh Pierre Hotel, the apartment comes with top notch butler services as well as access to a chauffeured Jaguar XJ

In addition to access to the Taj Royal Attaché butler services and Jaguar XJ, those services also include pet care for the most pampered of pooches.

The corner unit, called the Park Suite, also features the finest of appointments, including Murano glass chandeliers, curated art and 'bespoke fabrics.'

When priced by square foot, the one bedroom is even more expensive than a full floor unit that was rented for $500,000 per month in December.

Lavish: The Pierre (pictured at right) offers spectacular Central Park views. The apartment is, in fact, called the Park Suite and sits at the corner of the historic building

The 4,786-square-foot unit includes the two-bedroom Presidential Suite, with the option of adding two other spaces bringing it to a total of six bedrooms.

Perched at 2 East 61st Street, the delicate windows look out over Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and George Washington Bridge.

And if the pantry kitchen is too small for would-be renters, they can always nip down to one of the hotel's two restaurants, Sirio Ristorante and Two E Bar/Lounge. 

Twice-daily housekeeping, butler service and a chauffeur-driven Jaguar are also available at the touch of a button. 

The Pierre underwent a $100 million renovation in 2005, and is now a hotel and residence building managed by Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces
