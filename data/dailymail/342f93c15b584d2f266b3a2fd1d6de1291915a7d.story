A series of high profile speakers have cancelled their talks at the Oxford Union as the historic debating society’s president faces rape allegations.

The world's top law enforcer, Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble, was due to address the Oxford Union on May 30, but sent a letter saying he will cancel after leader Ben Sullivan, 21, was arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape this month.

Other speakers to pull out include David Mepham, UK Director of Human Rights Watch and Julie Meyer, the American entrepreneur and judge on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den.

It comes after Mr Sullivan, a wealthy banker’s son, made a return to office last week following his arrest - sparking resignation calls from some rank and file members.

In the letter, American Mr Noble said: 'What should the head of a society like the Oxford Union do if he is under investigation for rape and attempted rape?

'In my view, he should be guided by the best interests of his organisation. He should not be guided by his own interests.

'In this case my advice to Ben Sullivan would be either to resign or take a leave of absence until the criminal investigation has been completed.

'Interpol has attempted to contact the Oxford Union since reports of the allegations against Ben Sullivan first surfaced. We have received no response to our inquiries.

'Consequently I have decided to withdraw my participation as a speaker at the Oxford Union on Friday 30 May 2014.'

Mr Sullivan was arrested in his rooms at Christ Church College and bailed to return to police on June 18. He has not been charged with any offence.

He was initially replaced by acting president Mayank Banjaree, 21, but returned to chair a debate last Thursday.

He made a defiant speech to members protesting his innocence, and said: 'Unfortunately I am not able to give any detailed comment on what is now an ongoing police investigation.

'As you may be aware no charges have been brought against me and I have the utmost faith in the police and Crown Prosecution Service and the British legal system as a whole. I know that sooner or later the truth will prevail and justice will be served.'

Mr 
Sullivan, from Kensington, London, is due to complete his stint as 
president at the end of the academic term and is now expected to 
continue in his presidential duties until he answers bail next month.

Despite his defiant stance, Mr Sullivan continued to face calls to resign last night.

An open letter online calling for him to step down has been signed by feminist activists Laurie Penny and Caroline Criado Perez.

It was also signed by the left-wing columnist Owen Jones among others.

The letter says: 'We are writing this open letter, as members and former speakers at the Oxford Union, and members of the university community, to express our concern at the ongoing situation at the society.

'Last week, President Ben Sullivan returned to his role as President of the Union following his arrest earlier this month. This is despite being under ongoing investigation by the police for rape and attempted rape.

'Though he has not been charged, he remains on bail. In order to recognise the severity of these allegations and protect the reputation of the society, Mr Sullivan should step aside while still under investigation.

A spokesman for Oxford Union did not return requests for comment yesterday.
