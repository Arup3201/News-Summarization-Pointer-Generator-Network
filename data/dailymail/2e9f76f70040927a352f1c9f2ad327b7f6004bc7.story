Investigators are interviewing the pilots of the doomed Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in a bid to find out why the aircraft clipped the seawall before slamming into the tarmac at San Francisco Airport.

The National Transportation Safety Board is halfway
 through the interviews with the four-member flight crew, but they 
still have to talk to the pilot who was controlling the plane when it 
crashed.

Pilot Lee Kang Kuk, who had just 43 hours' 
experience flying a Boeing 777, was at the controls during the plane's landing in San Francisco - which was his first time flying the model 
to the airport.

Choi Jeong-ho, from 
South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, said on Tuesday that investigators from 
both countries quizzed two of the four Asiana pilots, Lee Gang-guk and 
Lee Jeong-min, on Monday, and they planned to quiz the two others and air controllers on Tuesday.

Investigation: Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the NTSB will interview the pilot at the controls of the doomed Asiana Airlines flight on Tuesday

NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman added that flight attendants 
will also be interviewed on Tuesday to determine how successful the 
evacuation process was; there have been reports one of the escape slides
 was faulty.

She said that the
 process has so far been slowed by language barriers.

'I am looking forward to having the crew
 interviews done,' Hersman said on Monday.

'It's going 
very slowly. We want to make sure the crew members aren't confused, that
 the information that's being exchanged is clear, that weâ€™re getting out
 of it all the information that we need.'

Although the NTSB has revealed that the plane was landing too slow and attempted to accelerate too late - tipping the plane upwards and smashing the tail to the ground - Hersman told CNN that it was too early to determine the cause.

'I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error because there's so much that we don't know,' she said. 'We have to understand what these pilots knew. We also need to look at how they were flying the airplane.'

She added that it was helpful to have the pilots to interview so that investigators could understand what they were thinking and to determine when they realized there was a problem.

Questions include whether all four 
pilots were in the cockpit, as expected, or just the trainee and his 
trainer, who were both experienced pilots on other aircrafts.

But the airline acknowledged on Monday 
that the pilot at the controls had little experience flying that type of
 plane and was landing one for the first time at that airport.

Officials emphasized that there will not be an interrogation of the pilots.

'The NTSB will ask them to tell us in 
your own words what was going on,' former NTSB managing director Peter Goelz said.

'The investigators will have some 
advantage, they'll have some information from voice recorder. But it's 
not a cross examination, it's an effort to understand what the pilot 
remembers and what he remembers saying and doing.'

He added that there is a possibility a license could be revoked, or fines or penalties issued.

Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was 500 feet above ground and about half a minute from San Francisco International Airport when its speed dropped below the threshold for a safe landing speed.

It continued slowing until just about eight seconds before touch down when pilots recognized the need for more speed and throttled up, NTSB investigations show.

By the time the engines started adding speed, the plane was barely above San Francisco Bay and the plane clipped the seawall at the end of the runway, slammed down and then caught fire.

Miraculously, only two of the 307 people on board died, and most of the survivors suffered little or no injuries. More than 120 people walked away without any injuries.

The Air Line Pilots Association has criticized the NTSB for releasing so much information at such an early stage in the probe.

'The
 release of individual data points from the flight data recorder and the
 cockpit voice recorder - without the context of the entire body of 
factual investigative data - represents a potential detriment to flight 
safety,' the group said in a statement.

'It
 encourages wild speculation, as we have already seen in the media, 
about causes of the accident before all the facts are known, before 
investigators have the ability to determine why the events occurred, and
 in this case before the flight crew had even been interviewed.'

Destruction: More than 180 people were injured in the crash but miraculously, 120 were not

Authorities will also reviewing the initial rescue efforts after fire officials acknowledged that one of their trucks may have run over one of the two Chinese teenagers killed in the crash.

The students, Wang Linjia and Ye Mengyuan, were part of a larger group headed for a Christian summer camp with dozens of classmates.

The NTSB said they are reviewing airport surveillance video to determine whether an emergency vehicle ran over one of students, killing her, but they have not reached any firm conclusions.
