Thibaut Courtois has revealed how Petr Cech gave him tips and advice about protecting his head in English football’s danger zone after seeing him hurt in a collision with Arsenal’s Alexis Sanchez.

Courtois was forced off after clashing with Sanchez two weeks ago and Cech, who required emergency surgery after fracturing his skull at Reading in 2006 and still wears a headguard as a result, was keen to share his expertise on the subject.

The two Chelsea goalkeepers went away on international duty but that did not stop the Czech calling and sending text messages to his Belgian clubmate with advice about using his shoulders and back to protect his head when diving among the boots.

Courtois said: ‘He told me that in the Premier League, maybe some strikers really go in against the keepers, so sometimes it is better to protect your head, to go down quicker and with your back or your shoulder protecting your head.

‘That was a tip he gave me and it’s good because, when you come into a new league sometimes things are different.

‘In Spain there is more organisation, maybe more football, while here maybe some teams are going quicker with the long ball and rushing it to the front. 

The Belgian was escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room

'It’s maybe more physical here and maybe the referees don’t whistle as quick as they do in Spain.’

Courtois recovered to play twice for Belgium during the international break and was back in the Chelsea team at Crystal Palace on Saturday, which meant a return to the bench for Cech, who had replaced him during the first half against Arsenal.

The two players are duelling for the same place in the team and Cech must be smarting having been the club’s undisputed No 1 for a decade, but it speaks volumes that he is so quick to call and text with offers of help.
