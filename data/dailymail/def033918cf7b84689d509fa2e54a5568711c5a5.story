Disgraced teacher Debra Lafave, the woman convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old student is officially back on probation amid protests from the victim's family.

The 32-year-old was dealt a ten-year suspended sentence in 2005 for a string of sexual encounters with a pupil at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida.

But the punishment was frozen by a retiring judge to allow her to help care for her newborn twin sons as well as her cancer-stricken mother in 2011.

On Thursday, however, she was put back under Federal supervision to see out the remaining four years and two months of her sentence.

Reinstated: Former Florida teacher Debra LaFave who pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old student, was ordered back on probation on Thursday

Too lenient: In 2011 a retiring judge offered leniency to Lafave releasing her from her seven-year probation before it was later deemed an 'abuse of judicial power'

Speaking alongside her parents yesterday, the now mother-of-twins said: 'My mom was diagnosed with cancer for
 the second time, and I spent my year off probation taking care of her 
and I'm so fortunate that I was able to take her to chemo treatments and
 spend the nights with her when she needed me the most.'

Lafave's striking looks made her a household name in 2005 after she was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery, barely more than a year after she married.

The story took a bizarre twist after John Gillespie, the lead detective in her case, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting, while Tampa Bay Police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell.

Attention grabbing: Lefave's crimes drew national attention after provocative images taken of her before teaching, like this one, were released

In 2009, once she completed sex 
offender therapy, a judge allowed her to have contact with her 
relative's children, though she was still banned from living within 
1,000 feet of where children congregate.

Lafave later went on national 
television to explain her actions, attributing her indiscretions to 
bipolar disorder, hyper-sexuality and poor judgement during manic 
episodes.

Her ex husband,  Owen Lafave, left her and also appeared on a number of chat shows, before she remarried and gave birth to twins.

In 2011 a retiring judge offered 
leniency to Lafave - who is now using her maiden name Beasley - but in a
 move an appellate court later ruled to have been an ‘abuse of judicial 
power.’

But before the 
judge made that ruling, a sister of Lafave's victim - who is now 23 - 
said her brother's mental health has been devastated. Her voice shaking,
 the sister was allowed to testify after giving only her initials.

'This
 is something that has consumed his life,' she said, adding that her 
brother remained under psychiatric care and was himself opposed to an 
early end to her probation.

Circuit
 Judge Lisa Campbell reinstated Lafave's probation on Thursday to finish
 the remainder of her sentence of four years and two months.

Rules apply: LaFave, pictured beside her attorney and mother in blue, must stay away from schools and has a curfew set from 10pm to 6am

Staying close: Lafave said she was thankful for her time off her probation with it allowing her to spend more time with her mother, pictured, who was diagnosed with cancer for the second time

She
 also reinstated her curfew from 10pm to 6am and said the former teacher
 must stay away from schools as well as her former victim she met while 
teaching at Angelo L. Greco Middle School in 
Temple Terrace, Florida.

She was charged with two counts of 
felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex
 on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at the school.

Lafave was reported by the boy's mother in May of 2004 and was immediately arrested.

The disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely, despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted.

She was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest.

LaFave's attorney on Thursday said they don't plan to give up after appealing to the state's highest court.

‘It's been eight and a half years now and the case is still not over,’ John Fitzgibbons told the Times.

'We're hopeful that we will receive a favorable ruling within the next six months to a year from the supreme court and then that should finally conclude things.’

Exiting the courthouse Lafave’s mother gave a thumbs up to reporters’ cameras while trailing behind her daughter.

Asked how she’s feeling she said: ‘Fantastic. God is good.’

Lafave,
who garnered nationwide interest for her striking looks and provocative
modelling shots after she committed the crime, is banned from ever 
teaching in Florida again.
