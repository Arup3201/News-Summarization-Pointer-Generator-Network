An Oklahoma man was charged Thursday with two counts of second-degree rape after police identified him by a tattoo on his penis, investigators say.

Brandon Lee Aaron,  27, allegedly had sex with a 15-year-old girl who told police that Aaron had a tattoo of his ex-girlfriend's name on his penis, according to NY Daily News. 

Court records show that deputies saw the alleged tattoo after obtaining a search warrant for Aaron's body. 

Inked: Brandon Lee Aaron, 27, was linked to having sex with a 15-year-old girl after cops identified him by a tattoo on his genitals

Tulsa World reports that the Panama police chief found sexually explicit texts exchanged by Aaron and the minor referencing their sexual activity after the 15-year-old's sister reported the relationship to the police.

After reporting the activity, the girl's sister helped police find Aaron, who was taken into custody after being found at a Panama apartment. 

The girl told investigators that she and Aaron had sex twice, according to Tulsa World. 

The most recent sexual activity between the two allegedly occurred during the weekend before Aaron was taken into custody; the other incident occurred in June.

When police asked the 15-year-old if there were any scars or marks not visible with clothing she told them that Aaron had a tattoo of his ex-girlfriend's name on his penis. 

Custody: Aaron remains in custody at the LeFlore County Detention Center with bail set at $25,000

Police say that Aaron initially denied having sex with the teen. However, an affidavit states that Aaron later admitted to having sex with the girl once in her sister's home and once in his mother's home.

After his confession, Aaron reportedly told police he 'knew it was wrong' and made efforts to distance himself from the minor. 

Aaron remains in custody at the LeFlore County Detention Center with bail set at $25,000.
