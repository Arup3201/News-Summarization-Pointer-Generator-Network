It was the fight that made a national hero out of German commander Paul von Hindenburg, after his forces crushingly overcame the Russians.

Now, 100 years on from the crucial Battle of Tannenberg, some 200 history enthusiasts gathered today on a hilly area in Poland for its reconstruction.

The critical engagement between the invading Russian Second Army and the German Eighth Army took place in the early days of the First World War.

Historic: Members of a military club participate in the reenactment of The Battle of Tannenberg on the battlefield at Szkotowo in northern Poland

Fighting: Actors dressed as German and Russian soldiers take part in the reenactment ahead of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War

Engagement: The battle was fought by the Russian Second Army against the German Eighth Army between August 26 and 30, 1914

Location: The reenactment was held on the site of the original battle, which in 1914 was in eastern Prussia, but which now lies in Szkotowo, Poland

Hats off: The reenactment took place just one day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the war, although the original battle took place in August 1914

Problem: The lack of effective communication between the two Russian armies - separated by the Masurian Lakes - greatly contributed to their downfall

The reenactment was held on the site of the original battle, which in 1914 was in eastern Prussia, but which now lies in Szkotowo, northern Poland.

It took place just one day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the war, although the battle itself took place from August 26 to 30, 1914.

That month, two Russian armies had invaded German East Prussia. The first was under Paul von Rennenkampf and the second Aleksandr Samsonov.

Rennenkampf’s army defeated eight divisions of the German Eighth Army at Gumbinnen on August 20 - but did not make contact with Samsonov.

Then, German commanders Erich 
Ludendorff and Hindenburg launched a huge attack against Samsonov’s 
isolated army at Tannenberg on August 26.

The
 lack of effective communication between the two Russian armies - 
separated by the Masurian Lakes - greatly contributed to their downfall.

Surrender: History enthusiasts from across Europe gathered in northern Poland to reconstruct the Battle of Tannenberg

Tactics: The Germans intercepted wireless messages from both Samsonov and Rennenkampf, and surprised the former's army with a strong attack

Riding: Samsonov lost half of his army during the first few days of the conflict and shot himself on August 30. By the end the Germans had taken 92,000 prisoners

Numbers: The Russians had had more than 50,000 killed, while the Germans only suffered a total of 13,000 casualties.

Dressed up: Actors dressed as Russian soldiers perform an attack, as another actor dressed as an orthodox priest, left, prays, during the reenactment

Important moment: Tannenberg was a significant defeat for the Russians, who had lost almost an entire army along with 400 guns and other weapons

Helping hand: The battle made a national hero out of German commander Paul von Hindenburg, after his forces crushingly overcame the Russians

The Germans intercepted wireless messages from both Samsonov and Rennenkampf, and surprised the former’s army with a strong attack.

Samsonov lost half of his army over the next few days and shot himself on August 30. By the end the Germans had taken 92,000 prisoners.

Meanwhile the Russians had had more than 50,000 killed, while the Germans only suffered a total of 13,000 casualties.

One
 of the next fights that took place was the Battle of the Marne, which 
saw British and French troops defeat Germans advancing towards Paris.

However,
 Tannenberg was a significant defeat for the Russians, who had lost 
almost an entire army along with 400 guns and other weapons.

The
 battle also saw Hindenburg first come under the national spotlight, 
before the highly-decorated field marshal became Germany's president in 
1925.

Mapped out: The Battle of Tannenberg happened on ground in what is now the village of Szkotowo in northern Poland

The victory also brought renown for Ludendorff, and saw him made quartermaster general when Hindenburg was appointed chief of staff in 1916.

The fight is also sometimes known as the second Battle of Tannenberg, with the first taking place in 1410 when the Poles defeated the Teutonic Knights.

A memorial was constructed on the site under the direction of Hindenburg in 1927 to honour the German soldiers who died during the 1914 battle.

When Hindenburg died in 1934, his coffin was placed there and Adolf Hitler ordered the monument to be redesigned and renamed.

However, as the Russians approached in 1945, German troops removed Hindenburg's remains. The site was then demolished by the Polish in 1950.
