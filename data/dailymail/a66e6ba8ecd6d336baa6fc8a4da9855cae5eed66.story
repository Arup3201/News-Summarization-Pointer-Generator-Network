A Tory MP sold information to the communists at the height of the Cold War to pay for his secret gambling habit.

Ray Mawby lived a double life while serving as a minister in Sir Alec Douglas-Home’s government in the 1960s.

Czech Security Service files have revealed that the MP – who was given the codename ‘Laval’ – acted as a secret agent for more than a decade.

They show that the former MP for Totnes in Devon, who died in 1990, sold information to fund his roulette addiction and high-living lifestyle.

It was previously known that some Labour MPs, including the former minister John Stonehouse, had spied for the Czechs.

But this is the first time a Conservative has been shown to have engaged in passing information to the communists.

Secrets: MP Ray Mawby in 1958. He was codename 'Laval' by his Czech handlers

Yesterday MPs called for an investigation into Mr Mawby’s secret past and warned that the claims amount to treason.

The evidence, uncovered by the BBC, runs to hundreds of pages.

The working class Tory was recruited when he was 38 after he attended a cocktail party at the Czechoslovak embassy in November 1960.

An early report written by a handler said: ‘His leisure time he spends in bars... and also loves gambling. While playing roulette and other games he is willing to accept a monetary “loan” which was exploited twice.’

In the years that followed, Mr Mawby regularly charged for information, normally at around £100 a time.

One of the Czech files has a receipt signed by the MP himself. ‘Mawby has also promised to carry out tasks such as asking questions in Parliament according to our needs,’ a Czech handler wrote in a plan on how to use him in 1962.

That plan involved asking him to supply more confidential material ‘gradually deepening the compromising of his position’.

He later supplied spies with a 
floorplan of the prime minister’s Commons office, lists of parliamentary
committees, information about colleagues and a supposedly confidential 
parliamentary investigation into a Conservative peer.

The Czechs were surprised when he became assistant postmaster general and a junior minister in 1963.

His handler feared the promotion could
end their deal as it meant a salary increase of £2,000, but the MP 
continued to spy for the communists.

Much of  the information he passed was
political gossip. A handwritten note from 1963 reports on leadership 
machinations within the Tory Party.

As the 1964 election approached, the 
Czechs realised he could lose his ministerial job and developed a plan 
to pay him £400 a year for information to make up for his loss of 
salary.

As well as supplying information about
the layout of the PM’s parliamentary office, he provided details about 
its security arrangements.

Meetings took place sometimes three or
four times a month but dwindled by the end of the 1960s. The BBC said 
the file showed the relationship ended in November 1971.

The former electrician was deselected
as an MP in 1983 and died in 1990. Last night ex-Tory minister David 
Mellor said: ‘Ray was an old school full-time MP, ie he was more likely 
to be found in the bar rather than doing anything useful. He was a very 
jovial character.

'If you had to spend a long night 
having a laugh and a joke with Ray and others, you would. He was a 
simple, straightforward guy. I knew nothing of his gambling.’

MP Sarah Wollaston, who represents Mr Mawby’s old constituency, called for an inquiry.

She said: ‘These very serious 
allegations, amounting to treason, need to be fully investigated, but 
also fairly investigated because Mr Mawby is not here to defend himself 
and it’s in none of our interests to have trial by media.’
