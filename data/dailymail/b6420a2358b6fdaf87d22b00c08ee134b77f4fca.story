Four days after winning Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic has married his pregnant fiancee in a private ceremony in Montenegro.

Djokovic and longtime girlfriend Jelena Ristic were wed Thursday in an upscale resort on the Adriatic coast.

Local media say the ceremony was attended by family, friends and guests, but away from the public eye.

Newly wed: Novak Djokovic and Jelena Ristic, pictured here in 2012, got married on Thursday

Famous faces: Tennis legend Boris Becker was pictured as he arrives in Montenegro for Novak Djokovic and his fianc√©e Jelena Ristic's wedding

Never mind the weather: Boris was happy to walk around in just a polo shirt despite the light rain

All-white: The pair looked ready to finally become man and wife as they were pictured putting on a truly relaxed display in Montenegro on Wednesday

After beating Roger Federer in five sets Sunday for his second Wimbledon title, Djokovic dedicated the victory to his fiancee 'and our future baby.'

Djokovic
 and Ristic first met in high school. They have been together for more 
than eight years and are expecting their first child later this year.

Local
 media reports say resort employees, waiters and staff had to sign 
confidentiality agreements and were not allowed to use their mobile 
phones.

Family affair: Novak's younger brother, Djordje Djokovic, was pictured making his way to the rehearsal

Fun in the sun: Djokovic's close friend, Tennis star Viktor Triocki, was spotted spending some time in the sea

Here comes the... groom: Novak Djokovic arriving in Montenegro earlier this week ahead of his wedding to long-term love Jelena Ristic

Plenty to smile about: Ditching tennis whites for the occasion, Jelena looked every inch the ethereal bride-to-be in a flowing chiffon printed maxi-dress

Here come the guests: Fellow Serbian tennis player Janko Tipsarevic and his wife Biljana were spotted arriving at the wedding venue

Picture perfect: The couple tied the knot on Sveti Stefan, a 5-star franchise hotel of the international group of Aman Resorts, in the heart of the Adriatic

Man with the magic hands: Also seen arriving was Miljan Amanovic, the tennis star's personal physio

Brotherly love: Novak's tennis player brother Marko Djokovic was, of course, on hand to witness the lavish nuptials

Preparation: Men get the area ready at the luxurious resort of Sveti Stefan in Montenegro

Great view: The wedding party will certainly be relishing the chance to see the landscape from the roof top of the rustic building

What a week: Winning Wimbledon was no doubt the best way for Djokovic to lead up to his wedding
