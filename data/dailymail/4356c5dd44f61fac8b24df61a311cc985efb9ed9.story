Offensive: The tattoo posted on Twitter by Manchester United fan Danny Hornby

A man has been arrested over alleged threats to a football fan who showed off his offensive tattoo about the Hillsborough disaster.

Danny Hornby, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was forced into hiding by death threats after posting a picture on his Twitter page of a tattoo on his back which reads '96wne'.

The letters 'wne' are thought to stand for 'was not enough'.

This was a sick reference to the 96 Reds
 fans who died at the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham
 Forest on April 15, 1989.

The tattoo sparked outrage among internet users who threatened to injure and even kill him.

Hornby, 22, reported to be a Manchester United fan, has apologised for the wording 
and vowed to remove the tattoo. But police urged him to move out until 
the uproar dies down.

Police had to step in because 
22-year-old Hornby, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, feared for his life 
after fleeing his home with his girlfriend.

His
 parents, mother Kath and father Garry and younger sister Laura, have 
also moved out of the terrace house after the address was put on scores 
of internet ­forums.

It is understood he promised to cover up the tattoo and post a fresh image of his back on his Twitter page.

Lancashire Constabulary has made an arrest in connection with inciteful comments that Mr Hornby received that were trying to encourage people to harm him.

A police spokeswoman said: “A 20-year-old man from Fleetwood has been arrested on suspicion of intentionally encouraging/assisting the commission of an either way offence - incitement - in connection with comments made on a social media site and has been bailed pending further inquiries.”

Liverpool fan Stephen Landers wrote on Hornby’s Twitter
 page: 'It’s rather fitting the rat’s name is Hornby coz if I ever meet 
him I’ll break the c***’s arms n legs n leave him on the tracks.'

Another wrote: 'There would be a sense of irony if police had to identify Danny Hornby’s body by that tattoo.'

The former fish packer pleaded on Twitter not to involve his family. He wrote:'It’s nothing to do with them.

'I am not in Fleetwood nor staying with family or friends. I wish to apologise to everyone I’ve offended with regard to the tattoo, which is now covered.'

The Hillsborough Justice Campaign branded the stunt 'sad' but condemned the threats.

A spokesman told the Daily Star: 'It’s sad that someone feels the need to decorate their body with such ­inflammatory ­comments. But we don’t condone any threats against him.'
