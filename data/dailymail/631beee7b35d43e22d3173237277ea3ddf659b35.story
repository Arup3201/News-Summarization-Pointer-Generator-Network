Despite receiving several luxury cars and a $1.2million dollar home from Donald Sterling, V. Stiviano says their relationship was merely platonic.

In an interview on Wednesday with Dr Phil, Stiviano, 31, maintains that she never had sexual relations 'whatsoever' with the racist 80-year-old Clippers owner.

Stiviano also speaks about her work with Sterling, why she taped their private conversations and the real reason behind her now-signature visor.

Purely platonic: V. Stiviano says she never had sex with Donald Sterling in a new interview with Dr Phil

Candid: In the interview which aired Wednesday, Stiviano also talked about the nature of her work with Sterling, why she recorded their private conversations and the real reason behind wearing her visor

Sterling has always contented that his relationship with Stiviano was sexual, and stated in a phone conversation with a friend that the relationship started two months after they met when she showed up at his office asking for a job. 

Sterling said: ‘I’m paying a very high price for trying to get a girl hot and make it with her. Everybody in the world wants to f*** her. Listen, I’m telling you she was hot. It took me maybe an hour to get there but it was hot. So why did I do it? Because I’m 80-years-old.'

But on Dr Phil, Stiviano says she has no idea why Sterling has described her as his girlfriend.

'Only Mr Sterling would know why he said that,' Stiviano said. 'That's not what happened. I've never had any type of sexual contact with Mr Sterling, whatsoever.'

In response to Sterling's statement's that she 'loves sex' and has a 'fabulous body', Stiviano smiles, holds out her hands and shows off her figure.

'I mean, look at my body,' she says. 'I personally think I have a great, fabulous, body. In regards to why would he say that I like to have sex? I don't know.'

However, it's clear that the two became close emotionally as Stiviano tears up when she's forced to watch a clip of Sterling accusing her of releasing the recordings of his racist rant.

'I'm hurt that he thinks I did this,' she says.

When asked by Dr Phil is she loves 
Sterling, Stiviano says: 'I love him like a father. I love him like my 
best friend. I love him the way I love my brothers. It's easy to love Mr
 Sterling.

Dr Phil continues
 to question Stiviano about the nature of her relationship with 
Sterling, and whether it was an appropriate for a married man to be give
 an employee two Bentleys, a Ferrari, a Range Rover and a $1.2million 
condo.

Stiviano says she received the gifts because she's a 'good human being'.

'I've been around Mr Sterling for quite some time. He grew very fond of me and he likes me. He loved me as a person...

'Mr Sterling's a billionaire. He can afford to give someone a gift of that magnitude.'

She also maintains that other employees received Mercedes-Benz cars and houses from Sterling.

Stiviano
 has described herself as a personal assistant of sorts for Sterling in 
the past, but spoke in more detail about her job duties with Dr Phil.

She
 says she was 'paid under the table' because she never received a W-2. 
But when asked by Dr Phil how much she made or if she ever paid taxes, 
she said: 'I can not answer that'.

'I didn't have a set title. My days 
were so different. One day we would do real estate, the next day we 
would be in board meetings with the NBA, the next we would be having a 
dinner meeting with a potential sponsor. The next day Mr Sterling wanted
 to go shopping and get new clothes and socks,' she said.

The
 now-famous recordings of Sterling telling Stiviano not to bring black 
people to his games were released last month, after Sterling's estranged
 wife Shelly filed a lawsuit against his assistant claiming she swindled
 cash, real estate and cars from her family.

Stiviano always admitted that she recorded the conversations, but continues to deny releasing them to the media.

On Dr Phil, Stiviano says she recorded their conversations instead of taking written notes, and would sometimes forget to stop recording.

But she says she recorded Sterling with his permission and even played back some of his 'bi-polar moments' to set him straight.

'He would just lash out and say certain things that were absurd, things that were mean, things that were just out of the norm. And I would play those back to him to remind him of how he acted or how offensive he could be towards another person.'

Stiviano reportedly released the tapes to TMZ in response to his wife's lawsuit.

In the Wednesday interview, she said Shelly Sterling was jealous of her husband's favoritism. 

'I don't know why she would even file that lawsuit. What Mr Sterling did was something that he did. He chose to be generous and kind to me. Why would he even allow his wife to sue me? She should have addressed these issues with him, not me.

'I wouldn't be surprised if his own children were jealous of me.'

In the wake of the scandal, Stiviano says she hasn't been answering Sterling's phone calls anymore.

While the Clippers owner was banned from the NBA for like and hit with a $2.5million fine for his comments, Stiviano is reaping the attention of becoming an overnight celebrity.

Unimpressed: Dr Phil clearly doesn't buy some of Stiviano's statements

When asked if she likes the paparazzi constantly following her, Stiviano says: 'absolutely'.

'Are you kidding me? I get to experience first-hand what it is to be a celebrity in LA,' she said. 'I have to think about what I'm going to wear, how I'm going to do my hair.'

She even talked about her now-signature visor. In her first televised interview with Barbara Walters, Stiviano said she wore it to mask the 'pain' but admitted to Dr Phil that she used it to hide her face after recent plastic surgery.

'One of the other truths is I had just had a fraxel laser. I wore this visor which protects me from the UV rays.'

But when Dr Phil calls out her actions in front of the cameras, especially rollerblading while wearing her visor, as 'attention-getting behavior' Stiviano gets defensive.

'We all have different ways of coping,
 we all have different ways of dealing with issues,' a defensive 
Stiviano shoots back. 'Some of us drink, some of us exercise, some of us
 rollerblade. You live in Hollywood, you deal with Hollywood - so you 
tell me how should I have acted?'

'I was making light of the situation,' she says when shown wearing her visor paired
 with a sombrero on Cinco de Mayo. '... You tell me since you know how 
things work. Should I have been crying? Should I have stayed at home? 
Should I have been drinking? Should I have used drugs? You tell me. What
 would have been better? I used the mask.'

Stiviano's latest interview comes a day after the NBA's 30-page report on Sterling was released to the media, as they take their first steps towards trying to force him out of the Clippers.

The report accuses Sterling of trying to bride Stiviano into saying publicly that she doctored the tapes, as well as lying to league investigators.

In a Monday announcement, the league said they would hold a vote on June 3 to determine whether Sterling will keep his team or not. If three-quarters of team owners agree, Sterling can be forced to sell the Clippers.
