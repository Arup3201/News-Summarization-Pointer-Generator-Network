A small family-run restaurant in Utah has found itself at the centre of furious internet debate after an employee posted a graphic image of a dead police officer on social media.

Leslie's Family Tree restaurant in Santaquin fired cook Shawn Peterson, 27, after the disturbing image appeared on their Facebook page along with the words 'This Is What A Good Cop Looks Like.'

It appeared Peterson, who has worked at the Family Tree for four years, used his personal account to post the image on another page. But outraged police officials put then posted it to the restaurant's Facebook wall.

The photo triggered a surge of negative comments and poor reviews, although Peterson said he never intended to involve the restaurant in his personal actions.

'I let my emotions get the better of me and posted it just to kind of say screw you guys and that was a huge mistake,' he told ABC News. 'It was my stupidity to use that photo as an expression of my fear of what police are becoming.' 

When the restaurant fired Peterson - and offered law enforcement officers free meals as a goodwill gesture - a number of reviewers changed their tone and praised the Family Tree.

One commentator wrote on the Facebook page: 'I have deleted my last review... The owners heard of the issued and rectified it immediately. .. Hats off to they way they handled it and I hope they can move forward from here and continue to provide a safe, comfortable place for all.'

But others were not so supportive.

'I've been getting hate calls all day that's got me worried,' Family Tree owner Leslie Broadhead told ABC. 'It's more people that's mad because I fired him, his political right of speech and his views and I keep trying to explain to them I didn't fire him for that I fired him because he was hurting my business.'

'Now they're lashing out at the restaurant for firing me,' Peterson told the Salt Lake Tribune. 'I am grateful there are people who are standing up for me, but there's no need to take it out on the restaurant.

'I told [Leslie] she needed to fire me. They are great and amazing people, and they didn't deserve any of this.'

'I've gotten frightened from all the media hype, and I expressed it in the wrong way,' he added. 'But I never meant for anything to go on the restaurant. They were completely innocent.'

Leslie's daughter Dansie said she is trying to respond to angry comments and even 'totally untrue' allegations that the restaurant's food was poisoned.

'We're kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place,' she told ABC. 'Because we don't want to say he doesn't have his right to free speech but we don't condone what he said either.'
