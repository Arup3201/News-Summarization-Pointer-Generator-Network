Aston Villa’s internal investigation into suspended coaches Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa will be centred on allegations of bullying.

Their behaviour at the club’s Bodymoor Heath training ground is believed to have led to complaints being made by staff.

Culverhouse often takes over training from manager Paul Lambert and several players have grievances about his ‘aggressive’ methods.

Fabian Delph is understood to have 
been upset during a session in the week before the Fulham defeat, 
although his absence for that 2-1 loss was down to an achilles 
injury.

Reports also suggest
 Gabriel Agbonlahor has been left disappointed but his omission from the
 Fulham team was explained by illness.

Both returned to the starting 
line-up for the 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park.

Despite
 the club’s official statement indicating they have only been suspended,
 it is understood assistant manager Culverhouse and head of footballing 
operations Karsa have no future at the club. They each have a year 
remaining on deals but if found guilty of serious misconduct could be 
sacked without a pay-off.

The
 atmosphere at Villa’s training ground has been described as ‘poisonous’
 and Culverhouse is said to have fallen out with other members of the 
backroom team and senior players. He also exchanged angry words with 
fans after the Boxing Day defeat by Palace at Villa Park.

Under pressure: Lambert's Aston Villa side have lost seven out of their past 10 Premier League matches

Upset: Fabian Delph was thought to have been affected by an incident during training

Disappointed: Gabriel Agbonlahor was left out against Fulham but returned in the defeat at Palace

The defender started his career at Tottenham in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at Norwich.

During nine years at Carrow Road he played 370 times for the club, including in the famous win over Bayern Munich. He is in the Norwich City Hall of Fame.

He then moved on to Swindon and Brighton and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became Paul Lambert's assistant at Colchester in 2008 before following the Scot to Norwich and then to Villa Park.

Karsa
 is said to have had a turbulent relationship with members of staff at 
Villa, too and the pair were suspended by chief executive Paul Faulkner 
after Lambert decided the make-up of his coaching team was no longer fit
 for purpose.

Training this week has been described as having ‘the best atmosphere in ages’ in the duo’s absence.

Previously,
 some players were said to be confused by an insistence on long-ball 
tactics during sessions, while the schedule has been regularly fairly 
light. The first team were given both Sunday and Monday off after defeats by Fulham and Crystal Palace.

A full staff meeting planned for Thursday should allow for complaints to be aired publicly.

Lambert
 took the astonishing step of ending his six-year association with 
trusted aide Culverhouse on Tuesday after a complete breakdown in the 
pair’s relationship.

Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday

Gary Karsa did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at Enfield in 1998, where he was football and community officer.

He then moved to Barnet (where he joined up with Ian Culverhouse) but his big break came when he became head of youth at Wycombe in 2006 under Paul Lambert.

He followed Lambert to Colchester, where he became football operations manager, and was part of the team that moved to Norwich and then Aston Villa.

Sportsmail
 understands the move by Lambert came after a heated exchange in the 
dressing room following Saturday’s defeat at Palace.

Lambert’s
 working relationship with Culverhouse is said to have deteriorated so 
much that the pair have hardly spoken in recent weeks, causing 
disruption to Villa’s preparation for games.

Many
 Villa fans have been vocal in their desire to see the manager gone too, 
with chants of ‘We want Lambert out’ aired loudly during the loss at 
Selhurst Park on Saturday. But the Scot’s position is understood to be 
secure and he retains the backing of owner Randy Lerner.

However
 talks on a new three-year contract have been put on hold until the end 
of the season. His current deal expires at the end of next season.

Lambert
 and Culverhouse first joined forces at Colchester in 2008, before 
leaving for Norwich City in 2009 and steering the Canaries into the top 
flight. Their success persuaded Villa owner Lerner to appoint them after
 sacking Alex McLeish in 2012.

Walking into trrouble? Fans have turned on Lambert, increasing the chances he could be leaving

Villa
 have promoted former player and crowd favourite Gordon Cowans, 55, and 
goalkeeper Shay Given, 37, to assist Lambert while the club carry out 
their investigation.

It is 
quite some turnaround for Given, who has been left out of matchday 
squads and admitted in February that ‘Aston Villa want me out of the 
door.’ The Republic of Ireland keeper has been taking his 
coaching badges and is respected by players.

The
 club hope the change in key staff will raise morale and ensure a 
positive result from the important match against Southampton at Villa Park on
 Saturday.

Lambert said: 
‘I’m delighted to have Gordon and Shay to assist me in preparing the 
team for Saturday (against Southampton), which is what the whole group 
is focused on.’

The 
breakdown in relations between Lambert and Culverhouse has coincided 
with a dreadful run for the club that has seen them slip closer to the 
relegation zone.

Villa have picked up just seven points from a possible 30 and are currently on a run of four defeats.

European
 Cup winner Cowans said: ‘The manager has asked me to step up to assist 
him at this time and I’ll do my utmost for the club and the manager in 
helping prepare the team for Saturday’s game.’

Given added: ‘As players, it’s important that each and every one of us take responsibility right now and I’m delighted to play my part in helping the manager and the team go and try to win on Saturday.’
