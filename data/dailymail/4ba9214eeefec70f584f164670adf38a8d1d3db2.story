Unite boss Len McCluskey has been given a £5,000 pay rise to £140,281 - just less than David Cameron's salary

Union chief Len McCluskey has pocketed a £5,000 pay rise  while thousands of his members struggle with wage freezes.

The powerful Left-wing Unite boss, pictured below, saw his package jump to £140,281 last year – just short of the salary paid to David Cameron.

The 3.7 per cent rise came as thousands of Unite’s public sector members face the fifth consecutive year of pay freezes and below-inflation rises.

Unite yesterday defended the 3.7 per cent rise, saying all of its officials had received the same rate.

‘It reflects the fact that union members win better pay deals,’ a spokesman said.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps criticised the rise, saying: ‘Ed Miliband’s trade union paymasters have caused misery with strikes and disruption, but now it emerges Red Len has given himself a massive pay rise. It’s do as we say, not as we do.’

The rise was revealed as activists from Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, prepare for a conference in Liverpool next week to finalise a list of hard-line policy demands ahead of next year’s General Election in a bid to drive the party further to the Left.

Mr McCluskey will open the policy conference with a rallying call on the economy where is expected to demand that Labour rejects austerity and turns the spending taps back on.

The draft agenda for the week-long conference, reveals that activists expect to see a clear return on the £16.2 million Unite has handed Labour since the last election.

Policy proposals include the nationalisation of large parts of the private sector at a cost of tens of billions of pounds, the lowering of the state pension age and the abolition of the anti-strike laws introduced by Margaret Thatcher to end the industrial chaos of the 1970s.

Militants are pushing for the union to cut its donations to Labour by 20 per cent unless Mr Miliband agrees to reverse all of the Coalition’s spending cuts.

The conference will be attended by a number of senior Labour figures, including the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who is expected to back Unite’s call to reverse ‘creeping privatisation’ in the NHS.

It comes just weeks before Labour’s National Policy Forum meets to agree the outline of the party’s election manifesto.

Labour last night insisted it will write its own manifesto. But, with Labour increasingly reliant on Unite’s cash, Ed Miliband will be under intense pressure to give in to his paymaster’s demands.

One motion at the conference warns: ‘The Labour Party is our party, it was formed by the trade union movement and we will not be pushed out by those who want our money and support at election time but do not want us to play any role in the party structures or the formulation of policy.’ 

Critics point out that Mr Miliband has already accepted a number of Unite’s key demands, including increasing the top rate of tax and introducing rent controls.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke warned that Unite’s policy ideas would ‘kill the economic recovery stone dead’.

Mr Elphicke said: ‘This is a dangerous, out of touch agenda that would put the 1970s to shame. It would reverse our economic success, bring irreparable harm to our country and damage our children’s future.

‘But Unite knows that Ed Miliband is so in hock to them that he will struggle to resist their demands. He should put the country’s interests first but he is too weak to stand up to his paymaster Len McCluskey.’ 

Motions on the draft agenda include a call for mass nationalisation of a swathe of industry, including the water, gas and electricity utilities, the Royal Mail, the railways, the buses, prisons and even care homes.

Several motions also call for increases in the state pension age to be reversed so that people can continue to retire at 65, despite the crippling cost of the measure.

Labour is also urged to reject fracking for gas, despite its potential to generate billions of pounds for the economy and cut fuel bills.

And Labour will be pressed to ‘repeal all anti-trade union laws brought in by Tory governments’.

Activists will also pressure Labour to outlaw zero hour contracts, despite their use by hundreds of thousands of people.

Labour last night insisted that Mr Miliband would not necessarily accept all of Unite’s demands.

A Labour source said: ‘Unite is entitled to debate whatever policies it wants at its conference. We will decide our policies on the basis of what is in the best interests of the country.’
