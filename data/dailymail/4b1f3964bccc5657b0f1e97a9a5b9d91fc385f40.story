Chris Eubank Jnr must ditch his famous father from his training set-up if he is to realise his potential, according to promoter Frank Warren.

Eubank suffered his first career defeat last weekend against British, Commonwealth and European middleweight Billy Joe Saunders.

And while Warren believes the 25-year-old has a bright future but is being hindered by his dad's influence.

Eubank Snr has consistently overshadowed his son in the build-up to his fights 

Writing in his Independent column, he said: 'The boy is a terrific talent but in boxing terms needs to grow into a man – his own man. By that I mean he must step out of the all-enveloping shadow of his father, a great world champion he so closely resembles in his style, stance and mannerisms. 

'He also has his dad’s arrogance, his heart and his bottle. But he hasn’t yet got Chris Snr’s skills and strategical nous. And I am not sure that Brighton’s erstwhile Lord of the Manor is the one to impart them.

'That job is best left to the man who has trained them both. Yet on Saturday night, Ronnie Davies, though nominally chief second, was virtually a bystander as posing pater, eccentrically clad as always and looking more like a character out of Tatler than a working cornerman, hovered around them.

'I really don’t get this dad thing – and I doubt the son needs it. The bottom 'line is that a boxer only requires one person in the corner giving instructions, and that is the one who works with him on a daily basis: the trainer, the one who is reading the fight. The Eubanks have got to sort out their relationship. At the moment the Eubank show seems more about Chris Snr than Jnr.'

While Eubank must now rebuilt, Saunders is the mandatory challenger for the WBO world title. He will face the winner of Matt Korobov's fight with Andy Lee on Saturday week.
