A Tesco lorry has left a trail of destruction left after it careered off a road, crushing five vehicles and crashing into a house.

The cause of the crash is unknown but it is thought the driver of the HGV was only a few hundred
 yards away from his depot.

Emergency services attended the scene, but nobody was hurt in the early morning collision in a quiet residential road in Heathfield, Devon.

A Tesco lorry has left a trail of destruction left after it careered off a road, crushing five vehicles and crashing into a house

The crash has demolished a wall of a house in Heathfield, Devon, which was just yards away from a sleeping resident

It is believed the lorry collided with a small flat-back truck, before smashing into the house then hitting four more vehicles before finally coming to rest 50 yards up the road.

A young woman who was inside the house - which has been part demolished by the impact -  said she had been asleep in the next room and had been left 'in shock'.

Several vehicles, including an MG sports car, were crushed.

Fiona Davies, who lives at a cottage nearby, said: 'I heard the sound of metal scraping and rubbing and then a loud vibrating noise which turned out to be the cooler from the refrigerator in the back if the lorry.

'I came outside and it was a scene of devastation.

'Fortunately nobody was hurt but I've got a new shed and a tree in my garden.

Neighbours David and Julie Richardson said they heard a loud bang and a flash.

Mrs Richardson said: 'I thought it was thunder and lighting.

'We looked out if the window and it was clear. The ambulance was first here but the police were here quickly too.'

Several vehicles, including an MG sports car, were crushed and one property was severely damaged, before the Tesco lorry came to rest 50 yards up the road

The HGV is believed to have collided with a flat back lorry and a Nissan, before ploughing through a garden and into a house - leaving a huge hole in the living room.

The momentum of the lorry then then took out two more cars before hitting a telegraph pole and pushing a van and a shed into a back garden at least 50 yards from the first impact.

Fire incident commander Gary Martin described the scene as 'absolute carnage'.

The HGV is believed to have collided with a flat back lorry and a Nissan, on Saturday morning, before ploughing through a garden

He said: 'When we arrived the ambulance and police were already there. It was absolute carnage.

'We liaised with paramedics who were treating the lorry driver for shock.

'It is very, very fortunate that no one was injured when you consider how badly damaged the cars were.'

The road was closed by police for much of Saturday.

A Tesco spokesperson said: 'We are relieved that no-one was hurt during the incident. We will be assisting the police with their inquiries.'
