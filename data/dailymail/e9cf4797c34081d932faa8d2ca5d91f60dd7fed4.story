Tourism Australia has posted a picture encouraging people to enjoy a drink at a park overlooking popular Bondi Beach in Sydney, where alcohol is in fact banned.

The organisation posted the sunset picture on their @Australia Instagram and Twitter accounts with the caption 'Afternoon drinks on the North Bondi grassy knoll is a lovely way to end the day'.

The caption continued: 'Watch the sun disappear behind the horizon with a picnic basket and a chilled bottle of wine ... perfect!'

When the post was raised with local Waverley Mayor Sally Betts, she said 'I may have to have a talk with them about that,' the Wentworth Courier reported.

Police and local council rangers patrol the beach and surrounding areas and if a person is caught drinking alcohol it is tipped out and disposed of.

They can also face a $110 fine for failing to comply with terms of notice erected by council.

Tourism Australia spokesman Leo Seaton said the organisation reposts pictures sent in by the public.

'When we get photos sent we add a relevant caption,' Mr Seaton told Daily Mail Australia.

'There was some reference the enjoying a glass of wine.

'When it was brought to our attention that there was an alcohol ban it was very simple, we changed the caption.' 

The organisation has since changed the caption to remove the reference to alcohol
