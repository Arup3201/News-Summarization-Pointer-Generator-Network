From blasting aliens and escaping charging warlocks to bluffing on poker sites, online gaming can be intense.

Now there’s a mouse designed to let geeks continue their gaming adventures without working up a sweat – on their hands at least.

A mouse called Ventus X has a built-in honeycomb grill to let the skin breathe and a rugged coating so sweaty gamers can continue to the accessory.

The mouse provides ‘enhanced modern technology and classic design that fits all gamers and bring style to gaming,’ according to the Taiwan-based firm that makes it.

Some realistic combat and multiplayer games tap into the body’s flight or fight response, causing adrenaline to surge through gamers’ bodies and prepare the body for physical activity.

While clicking violently may not qualify as a work out, gamers can get sweaty, and this can make their mouse slippery.

Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side (pictured)

Instead of fitting a miniature fan like some of its rivals, Taiwan-based ThermalTake, which produces cooling kit for computers, has designed a mouse with a matte coating or rough texture and rubber grips down its side.

‘The new VENTUS X was designed with a new coating that gives full comfort while in gameplay,’ it says.

This means that the tool retains its grip in the sweatiest situations, while ventilation is provided by a honeycomb grill where the hand rests on the mouse.

The grille’s meant to help because sweat can evaporate faster than on a solid surface, when a user raises their hand or withdraws it, letting air to the area. 

Like many mice designed for serious gamers, it has a laser sensor so that sensitivity can be turned up high and programmable buttons.

It costs $50 (£34) via gaming hardware websites.

A video game fan coughed up blood and dropped dead in a Chinese internet cafe last month after playing World Of Warcraft for 19 consecutive hours without a break.

Wu Tai, 24, went to the unnamed internet cafe in Shanghai to play the latest installment of the role-playing fantasy game alongside other fans of the popular series.

CCTV footage shows him sitting in front of the computer and suddenly turning to his left to cough violently, before slumping in his chair and dying in front of shocked fellow gamers.

Concerned onlookers called an ambulance for Mr Wu, who is understood to have continued playing the video game while waiting for the paramedics, despite clearly being seriously ill.

Horrified fellow gamer Hsin Lo, 20, said: 'I called for an ambulance while my friend went to get some help from staff. But while we waited he just died in front of us, and was nothing for the staff to do,' Mr Hsin said.

When medical crews arrived they tried to resuscitate Mr Wu but he was already dead.
