Pop starlet Selena Gomez was so heavily criticized for posting pictures of herself flashing her ankle inside Abu Dhabi's Grand Mosque on Instagram that she appears to have deleted the evidence altogether.

A second picture, showing Gomez and fellow musicians Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Cody Simpson and Shay Mitchell smiling and striking poses has also been lambasted but remained on her Instagram Thursday.

Mosque visiting rules strictly ban all 'intimate behavior' including holding hands and kissing, and states that all skirts must be ankle-length.

This image showing Selena alongside Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Cody Simpson and Shay Mitchell also drew fury from Instagram users, who branded it 'disrespectful'

Selena also posted a video to Instagram showing her eating with a meal with friends and making a face for the camera

Commenting on the picture, Alaa Almitwally said: 'Disrecpectful! It's a religion place not a place to have fun in, so disappointed.'

Meanwhile another user, Ayisha Elturk, said: 'If their intent was to learn about Islam they wouldn't be posing like they were standing outside and amusement park.

'I like Selena Gomez but to have her do something like this makes me no longer a fan.'

However, not everyone was critical of the pictures, with user Lemouza adding: 'They're not disrespectful.  Hundreds of thousand of people visit Sheikh Zayed's mosque in Abu Dhabi.

'It's a place of worship, yes I know, but God never forbade the entry of other religions into any mosque. So please respect the fact that they actually want to get to know Islam and its beauty.'

In 2013 Rihanna was asked to leave the mosque after posing for a series of pictures, with staff saying it was out of keeping with the 'sanctity' of the holy site

The controversial Barbadian performer also posted the images to her Instagram account after paying a visit to the site in Abu Dhabi

The Grand Mosque has caused problems for celebrities in the past, with controversial star Rihanna thrown out after posing for pictures inside the compound.

Staff ejected the Barbadian singer after complaining she did not have permission to carry out a photoshoot while dressed head-to-toe in a black jumpsuit.

Justifying their decision, workers at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque said Rihanna's actions had not been in keeping with the 'sanctity' of the site. 

The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is one of the most revered Islamic sites in the United Arab Emirates
