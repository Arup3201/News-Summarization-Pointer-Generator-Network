The family of a married couple found stabbed to death at their village home have spoken for the first time about their loss.

Police launched a murder investigation after Patrick and Gillian Kettyle, who were both in their 50s, died  at their detached property at The Copse in Fetcham, Surrey, shortly after midnight last Thursday.

Their family have today said 'our world has been dimmed with their loss' as they spoke of their 'horrendous' ordeal.

Lithuanian builder, Viktoras Bruzas, 38, who was arrested in nearby Oxshott after the discovery of the bodies, has been charged with two counts of murder.

Their deaths had sparked a police search for Bruzas, 38, who was arrested 18 hours later in nearby Oxshott. 

The self-employed builder, from Walton-on-Thames, appeared at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday charged with two counts of murder.

He had appeared briefly at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill, Surrey, on Saturday, where his case was sent straight to the crown court.

Judge Christopher Critchlow, Honorary Recorder of Guildford, transferred the case to the Old Bailey in central London. 

Bruzas, who moved to England in 2008, was remanded in custody. 

Initial post mortem examinations show the couple died as the result of multiple knife wounds. 

A weapon was found near their home after detectives began a forensic search of the area. 

Today, the family of the Kettyles have paid tribute to the couple, who were known as Pat and Gilly.

In a statement issued through Surrey Police, the family said: 'On behalf of the family of Patrick and Gillian Kettyle we would like to thank everyone for the overwhelming amount of kindness and support that has been shown to all of us during this most difficult time.

'Our special thanks also go to the paramedics and police. 

'Pat and Gilly were a wonderful couple who loved each other dearly.'

They added: 'It is true to say that the light in our world has been dimmed with their loss.' 

Police say Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each other.

Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm.

He ran the company from his home, while his wife worked as a facilities manager at Cargill Plc in Cobham, Surrey. 

Bruzas will appear at the Old Bailey in front of Mr Justice Sweeney on December 19.

He has been remanded in custody.
