She recently admitted scaling back her fashion work to spend more time campaigning on green issues.

But if anyone doubted Dame Vivienne Westwood’s eco-warrior credentials, the designer has made a rather startling confession.

The 72-year-old has revealed that her commitment to the environment means she doesn’t take shower every day, and even shares dirty bathwater with her husband.

Vivienne Westwood has admitted to not showering every day and even using her husband's bath water

Instead, Dame Vivienne said that she simply ‘washes her bits’ each morning before dashing out of the house.

The star made the comments during a new campaign video for animal rights group PETA. In the footage, she explains she has become a vegetarian in protest at how the meat industry is causing a depletion of the world’s water supplies.

Despite claiming that she can take ‘guilt free’ long showers because she does not support the meat trade, she said: ‘Normally at home I’m not used to the habit of a shower. I just wash my bits and rush out in the morning and more often than not get in the bath after Andreas.

She added: ‘I’m sorry but whatever you do is helpful. We have to start somewhere.

‘I know PETA because I’m a big friend of Pamela Anderson and Chrissie Hynde and they introduced me to it. That’s why I wanted to accept the invitation to do something to help stop cruelty to animals.

‘This is about how precious water is, it’s more important than the gas that the people want to dig up and we’re prepared to poison our water for that for example. Eating meat is one of the most environmentally damaging things it’s possible to do.

‘I’m a person who’s got enough money to make choices and this is my choice. We don’t need to eat animals, there’s too many of us anyway and eating animals is destroying the world. I believe that we are an endangered species and we need to think about what we’re doing. We’re probably killing our-selves through eating meat.’

The 72 year old has taken a step back from fashion designing to focus on her environmental campaigning work

The video, which also features Dame Vivienne taking a shower, is being released in advance of World Water Day on 22 March.

A European study recently claimed that it takes 4m gallons of water to produce one ton of beef, but just 85,000 gallons to produce a ton of vegetables. Another UN study singles out the meat industry as one of the leading causes of climate change.

Dame Vivienne is best-known for creating the punk look, with its zips, rips and chains, which was famously adopted by the Sex Pistols in the 1970s.

Initially working as a primary school teacher, she and Malcolm McLaren, one-time manager of the Sex Pistols, opened a shop called Let It Rock - also known as Sex - where she began selling her outrageous outfits.

The punk style included bondage gear, safety pins, razor blades, bicycle or lavatory chains and spiked dog collars.

She had a brief marriage to factory apprentice Derek Westwood in the 1960s, before marrying her former fashion student Andreas Kronthaler, an Austrian who is 25 years her junior, in 1992.

Earlier this year, the designer shaved off her mane of fiery red hair to help raise awareness about global warming.

She has been a long-time campaigner against the unsustainable use of the planet’s resources and even attributing fashion collections to a matter she believes passionately about.

Earlier this year she announced she won’t be expanding the fashion side of her business — a decision made to give the designer more time to focus on her work with Greenpeace.

She has also promised to donate £1m to fund eco-friendly projects, while she is also one of the few catwalk designers who advocates ethical fashion and dismisses spending thousands of euro on clothes that will never be worn.
