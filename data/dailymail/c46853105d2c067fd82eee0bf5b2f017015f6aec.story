More than 40 years after jumping bail, a 67-year-old man has surrendered to police to accept his punishment for shooting at officers in a gun battle.

On November 5, 1968, Ronald Bridgeforth was involved in a shootout at a San Francisco discount store after he was accused of using a stolen credit card to buy $29 worth of clothes and toys.

He has lived under the alias of Cole Lee Jordan over four decade, working his way up from being a janitor to earning a master's degree and becoming a college guidance counselor in Michigan.

Fugitive: Ronald Bridgeforth, 67, has surrendered to police to accept punishment for shooting at officers in a gun battle in 1968

On Thursday, after resigning from his job, Bridgeforth arrived at the Hall of Justice in Redwood City, California, and surrendered.

'This seems to be the right thing to do, and in the end it is all about family.' Bridgeforth said.

'I guess I've come back to face the consequences of my actions on that evning of 1968.'

'He wanted his sons to grow up to be the man he was today, not the young man he was on Nov. 5, 1968,' his attorney Paul Harris told ABCNews.com.

After being confronted on that day in 
1968, Bridgeforth allegedly pulled a gun on the officers and fired two 
bullets into a police car.

Police fired back, shooting him in the foot. No officers were injured in the shoot out and Bridgeforth was taken into custody.

Accused: Fugitive Ronald Bridgeforth is charged with shooting at police officers outside this store in San Francisco in 1968

He pleaded no contest to the shooting, but jumped bail in 1969 and escaped to Africa for a year, where he knew no one.

'He was 23 and scared, his lawyer said he'd serve life in prison because California had indeterminate sentencing at that time,'  Mr Harris said.

After a year, Bridgeforth returned to the United States and assumed his new identity as Cole Lee Jordan.

He settled in to life in Ann Arbor with his wife, Diane, who was the only person to share his secret.

Bridgeforth's two grown sons have only recently learned of their father's past.

He had even severed ties with his mother to keep his identity secret, reports ABCNews.com.

Bridgeforth got a job working as a 
janitor at Washtenaw Community College in 1978, according to Janet 
Hawkins, spokeswoman for the school.

'Throughout his work here, he went to school and took on various jobs,' Ms Hawkins said.

She told ABCNews.com that Bridgeforth earned a bachelors degree in general studies from Wayne State University in 1986 and a masters degree in counseling from Eastern Michigan in 1993.

He was licensed as a professional counselor in 1994 and became a faculty member at Washtenaw Community College in 1998, where he worked as a student adviser ever since.

Handcuffed: Bridgeforth was put in handcuffs and led away by bailiffs as he whispered, 'I love you,' to his wife

On Thursday, after his attorney said he 
would plead guilty on Nov. 22, Bridgeforth was handcuffed and led away 
by bailiffs as he whispered, 'I love you,' to his wife

Mr
Harris said he expects to make Bridgeforth's $25,000 bail, thanks to 
the level of support that he said has been pouring in 'from all over'

Bridgeforth knew when he came forward that he was also wanted for the 1971 fatal shooting of an officer.

He was alleged to be the getaway driver, but he denied any involvement. Mr Harris said his client wasn't even in the state at the time of the incident.

The San Mateo deputy district attorney said that those charges would be dropped.

Deputy District Attorney Karen Guidotti is asking a judge to sentence Bridgeworth to five years in prison, Harris said, but he's hopeful his client will walk away with probation.

Despite giving up his freedom, Mr Harris said Bridgeforth's family is proud of him for setting things right.

And after 41 years, he was able to have a long-awaited emotional reunion with his mother, who is now 82-years-old.

'His family is by his side right now,' Mr Harris told ABCNews.com, adding: '[Ronald] is one of the most dignified, good people I have ever worked with.'
