A Chinese banker is facing jail after he taunted police by sending them pictures of himself drink driving.

Chen Teng posted the images to traffic police in Shenzhen city in south east China’s Guangdong province using a computer in his BMW.

But his postings on weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook, proved his downfall when he made one insulting remark too many and police swooped to seize his car.

Chen Teng posted pictures on the internet of him holding beer cans, left, while driving his BMW. Police later seized the 29-year-old's car and found beer cans in the boot, pictured right

In one message, accompanied by a picture of him holding a beer, he asked: ‘Is it unlawful to drive while drinking?’

And in another he asked: ‘Do you really think ten beers is too much to drive with?’

Teng also boasted of violating numerous traffic laws and not ‘giving a damn.’

He uploaded his pictures and insults to the internet where, instead of being hailed a hero for poking fun at the authorities, he became a hate figure because he was putting the lives of innocent drivers in danger.

He had tried to escape by deleting the account but police had already seized the relevant images.

Chen Teng, pictured right, has lost his car and is facing charges on multiple traffic violations and risks a jail sentence

An employee of a local bank, he was arrested the following day and claimed that the beer bottles were empty and that he just made the photos ‘for fun’.

But police took a dim view of his behaviour and decided to prosecute.

Teng, 29, has lost his car and he is facing charges on multiple traffic violations and risks a jail sentence.

He has also been sacked after his bank employers found out.

‘We have got better things to do than fool around with drunken motorists,’ said a police spokesman.
