A new book of photographs has given a haunting insight into the lives of people who were held in institutions that used to be called 'lunatic asylums' in Britain.

Photographer Mark Davis spent more than six years travelling to abandoned former psychiatric hospitals, where patients were treated for a range of mental health problems.

His book, Asylum, captures the remains of 17 buildings, including West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, Staffordshire County Asylum, North Wales County Pauper Asylum and West Park Mental Hospital in Epsom, Surrey.

Mr Davis said: 'These buildings and its patients were often hidden from the public. It is important for us to remember these asylums in order for us to ensure we do not make the same mistakes.'

His work on the asylums was sparked by an interest in justice, which caused him to look deeper into the lives of the patients who were usually condemned to spend their entire lives in the institutions.

'What is most shocking about these places is the fact the people actually seemed quite normal,' said Mr Davis.

'You only hear of the most grotesque of cases but many people committed to asylums were in there suffering from illnesses such as depression due to loss of a husband, or even their job.

'To make these situations even more harrowing to hear is that once a person entered one of the asylums, it was very likely they would not come out even when cured.'

According to Mr Davis, many of the patients were detained if they had useful skills and given roles such as a seamstress or a builder because they would carry out such tasks for free.

Mr Davis began his journey around asylums in 2008 along with other photographers but later discovered going in alone helped him to transcend the atmosphere of each building.

He said: 'You would be surprised how easy it is to gain access to certain abandoned asylums. Many had the front door left swinging in the wind for anyone to enter.

'The one that struck me the most was Barrow Gurney Mental Hospital in Bristol. It is surrounded by a creepy woods near these abandoned villas and is the closest thing to being in a horror movie.'

In 1914, there were 102  registered 'lunatic' asylums across Britain with many of the Victorian structures being beautifully designed.

According to the book: 'County asylums were built at a rapid rate to cater for society's intolerance to behaviour and the increasing human wreckage associated with the newly industrialised society.'

To some, being committed to an asylum was worse than going to prison with asylums' only having 30 to 50 per cent discharge rate.

However, some asylums were that well designed that patients found the facilities were of a better standard than their current living conditions.

Mr Davis added: 'Many of the patients at these asylums came from poor backgrounds, so when they arrived in such places as West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum, who really went to town with the design and mosaics, they were humbled by being there and would do as they were told just to stay.'

The book, which is published by Amberley and also written by Mark Davis, is now available.
