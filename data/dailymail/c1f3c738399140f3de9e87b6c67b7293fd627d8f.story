The man accused of driving a souped-up Mustang that killed two men during an illegal street race in California was charged with murder - but an Instagram video may prove he wasn't at the wheel.

Henry Gevorgyan was charged with two counts of murder today in connection with an illegal car race that was held on February 25 in Los Angeles. 

Gevorgyan, 21, turned himself in to authorities on Saturday and is being held on $2million bail.

Henry Gevorgyan was charged with two counts of murder today after turning himself in over the weekend

 Police say his souped-up gray Ford Mustang killed Eric Siguenza, 26, and 50-year-old Wilson Wong

The suspect is accused of killing Eric Siguenza, 26, and Wilson  Wong, 50, when his gray Ford Mustang went out of control during the race in the Chatsworth section of the San Fernando Valley.

A third man who has not been identified was seriously injured.  

Gevorgyan and another driver fled the scene after the crash, according to police. 

When Gevorgyan surrendered over the weekend at the Los Angeles Police Department's Central Division station, his lawyer Kate Hardie was with him, the LA Times reported. 

Hardie said: 'He's terrified.

'He wants to do the right thing and come forward.'

She called her client a 'very nice kid' and said he is blameless for what happened because he was not behind the wheel of the Mustang when the crash occurred. 

 A video posted on Instagram by Valley Racing may back up her claim.

According to Hardie, a video of the race shows Gevorgyan standing between the two cars at the starting line and then flagging the start of the race with a flashlight.

The video has been shared on social media.

Some have been using the hashtag #FreeHendo with photos of Gevorgyan's face.

Gevorgyan has never been arrested before.

Before the charges were filed, LAPD officers  said they were aware of the video.

If Gevorgyan is convicted, he could face 33 years to life in prison.

The other alleged driver has not been located. 

Before charges were filed, officers with the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division said they were aware of the video

Though it's in a commercial area, the crash's location has been used for illegal races for quite some time

The street where the crash happened is mainly deserted after dark and has long been used for illegal nighttime street races.

Capt. John McMahon, commanding officer of the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division, told CNN that people should be aware that street racing is a dangerous activity.  

He said: 'Many view this as an entertainment, glamorous activity. 

'I think it's important for the public to know that this is illegal, dangerous and an all too deadly activity.'
