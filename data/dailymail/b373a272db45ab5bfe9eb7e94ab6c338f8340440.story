A 93-year-old German woman is being investigated on suspicion of serving as a Nazi SS guard during the Second World War.

Hilde Michnia is also accused of being involved in forcing prisoners on a march in which about 1,400 women died.  

Hamburg prosecutors' spokesman Carsten Rinio said today that his office had begun the investigation of Hilde Michnia last week after a private citizen filed a complaint against her as is allowed under German law.

She is suspected of serving as a guard in the Bergen-Belsen and Gross-Rosen concentration camps.

Prosecutors claim she was involved in the evacuation of the Gross-Rosen camp near the end of the war and forcing prisoners to march to the Guben labor camp farther west.

Michnia told Die Welt newspaper she had not been involved in any atrocities and only worked in the kitchens.

In Hanover, another 93-year-old is going on trial over his role in the murders of at least 300,000 at Auschwitz. 

The man is to appear before a German court on charges of assisting in the murders when he was a volunteer for the Nazi SS, the public prosecutor's office in Hanover said today.

He is accused of disposing of luggage of recently arrived prisoners to the Nazi death camp in German occupied Poland in 1944. 

The trial is due to start in the district court of the northern city of Lueneberg in April, Haaaretz.com reported.
