She's been making stellar appearances on red carpets and television, while he's been making headlines for odd behaviour.

On Thursday night, though, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber were reportedly spotted kissing in Oslo.

The 20-year-old singer apparently flew to Norway earlier this week to see the Baby hitmaker, who is currently on tour, and friends believe they are back together based on their affectionate display.

Selena on his mind: Justin Bieber was pictured in Amsterdam last week carrying an iPhone with a picture of his ex, and on Thursday night, the two were reportedly spotted kissing in Oslo

A source told People: 'They were holding hands, hugging and they kissed on the lips.

'They looked really in love, like no fights ever happened before. It definitely looked like they were back together.' 

Pals recently insisted that despite 
their on/off relationship, the pair – who split late last year - can't 
stay away from each other and have unstoppable chemistry.

A source said: 'They have a crazy connection. They just can't seem to break their connection. It can be intense.'

The rumoured reconciliation comes not
long after it was reported Selena had asked Paramount Pictures to 
remove her from Justin's sequel to his 'Never Say Never' concert film, 
for fear it would paint her in a negative light.

A source said: 'There are plenty of scenes where she's yelling at him, which, if edited, would make her look bad.

'Selena is desperately worried he'll try to exact some sort of revenge on screen.'

Despite her fears, the two might be giving their young love another chance.

Justin hasn't let go of his affection for Selena, as he was seen with a picture of the singer on his cell screensaver during his trip to Amsterdam last week.

The background image, spotted by TMZ, is from the 20-year-old's photoshoot taken on March 4.
