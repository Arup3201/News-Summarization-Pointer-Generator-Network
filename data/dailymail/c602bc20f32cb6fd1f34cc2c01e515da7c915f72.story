A buzzard had a remarkable escape after it traveled more than five miles with its head stuck in the bonnet of a delivery van before flying off, seemingly uninjured.

The low flying bird of prey collided with Karl Wholley's vehicle as he drove south from Adlington, in Cheshire, to Macclesfield.

Mr Wholley first noticed the buzzard was wedged into the grill on the front of his van as arrived on the A523 dual carriageway on the outskirts of the town last Wednesday.

It was not until he reached his boss John Lawson's vegetable wholesalers in Windmill Street, Macclesfield, that he was able to help the stricken bird.

An astonished Mr Wholley said: 'I'm used to transporting vegetables to some of the top hotels and this is the first time I've transported livestock.

'This has to be a one off and I'm sure that nobody else can say they have given a bird of prey a lift on a veg van.'

Vegetable wholesaler Mr Lawson, 46, of Sutton, Cheshire, said: 'The poor guy. At one point the buzzard was flapping its wings as he drove.

'He was that scared he did not know what to do and he just wanted to get back to the yard.

'It was a bizarre moment.

'When he arrived one of the other guys lifted the bonnet with a broom handle and it flew off.

'The buzzard did not even touch the floor before it flew off.

'As soon as its head was released its wingspan just frightened you to death.

'It just flew off. It was uninjured.'

It is thought the bird was flying low on a hunting mission when it collided with the van and got its beak stuck.

The greatest numbers of Buzzards, or 
Buteo Buteo, are found in Scotland, Wales, the Lake District and South 
West England, but they breed in every county of the UK.

The
bird of prey,  which can have a wingspan of more than four foot, can 
be found in a number of habitats, but particularly in woodland, 
moorland, and near villages - though they have been spotted in towns and
cities, including Glasgow, according to the RSPB.

In some areas they are known as the tourists’ eagle, often being mistaken for this larger bird of prey.
