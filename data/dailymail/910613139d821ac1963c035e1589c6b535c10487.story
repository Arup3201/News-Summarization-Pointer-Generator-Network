Have a good look at the fitting room door next time you try on something new - as you might not get as much privacy as you’d like.

Macy’s has installed its changing room privacy doors backwards to reduce customer theft, but there are concerns it is breaching clients' privacy.

Its Florida customers cannot see out while they change but employees or anyone else standing up against the doors can look inside.

Outside view: Macy's has installed its changing room privacy doors backwards to reduce customer theft, but there are concerns it is breaching privacy

It is illegal to secretly film inside changing rooms, but instead Macy’s installs privacy blinds backwards to help deter theft, reported 10 News.

State law allows shops to monitor customers from outside dressing rooms and the doors at Macy's are fitted with horizontal slat openings.

‘You could walk just about anywhere in the store and into a fitting room and nobody would stop you'

Former Macy's loss prevention specialist

An investigation by TV station 10 News looked at seven Macy’s outlets and found most of the fitting room doors were inverted.

However there were signs outside saying: ‘Fitting rooms are monitored by loss prevention personnel to prevent shortage’.

A former Macy’s loss prevention specialist claims to have been fired after reporting the fitting room issue to store managers.

‘We strive to make customers feel safe and secure at Macy's,’ the spokesman told 10 News.

The company added that retailers try to strike a balance between privacy, customer service, safety and cutting down on theft.
