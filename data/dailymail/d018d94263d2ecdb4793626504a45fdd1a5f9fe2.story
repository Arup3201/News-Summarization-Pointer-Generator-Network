David Cameron will today come under pressure to bring in laws to force Google and other web companies to crack down on child pornography.

Labour will trigger a Commons vote to demand legislation to force the hand of internet companies who have failed to act.

Days ago, the Prime Minister called for search engines such as Google and internet service providers to hunt down and banish child porn from the web.

But Ed Miliband will today demand Mr Cameron enshrines his demands in law.

Labour will use an opposition day debate in the Commons to urge the creation of measures to tackle internet child porn.

It will call for the Government to ‘set a timetable for the introduction of safe search as a default’ setting for internet search engines, meaning that anyone who wanted to access pornographic material would have to change the settings.

They also want effective age verification checks on pornographic sites, in the same way as they are used on gambling sites, forcing people to register credit cards and personal details in order to gain access.

Labour’s motion will also demand ‘splash page warnings’, which will flash a warning that a web surfer is about to visit a child porn site.

‘The recent convictions of Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell for the brutal murders of April Jones and Tia Sharp shocked the country,’ Mr Miliband told the Mail.

‘There are significant concerns over the lack of support available to the police to tackle the problem of child abuse online.

‘The whole of Britain is united in demanding action. That is why Labour has called a Parliamentary vote.’

The Prime Minister has summoned major web firms to a summit next week to explain how they can ‘do more to root out these disgusting images’.

Details of Labour’s ambush came as Claire Perry, the Prime Minister’s adviser on families, said it was wrong that just 5 per cent of reports to the Internet Watch Foundation – which removes illegal sites – came from the industry, with 95 per cent ‘depending on you and I stumbling across child porn and reporting it’.

At an event hosted by the think tank Policy Exchange, she said: ‘It’s as if we were finding the bags of drugs on the street and reporting them. It’s completely unacceptable.’

A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear that child sexual abuse is a sickening crime that we must eradicate both on and offline.’

Scott Rubin, of Google, said: ‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links, which we remove from our search index.

‘Whenever we discover child abuse imagery through our own systems or other channels, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’
