A pay-it-forward chain at a Florida Starbucks ended when a man opted not to buy the coffee of the person behind him in the drive-through line.

Peter Schorsch, customer number 458, ordered two Venti Mocha Frappuccinos and was told that one of his drinks had been paid for by the previous customer and asked if he'd like to do the same for the next customer.

Schorsch declined, saying he felt the phenomenon was a marketing ploy for the company and no longer a spontaneous act of kindness when the barista asks the customer to pay it forward.

Break in the chain: Peter Schorsch didn't 'pay it forward' because he didn't want to be part of what he felt was a marketing ploy by Starbucks

'I just don’t want to be forced into doing something,” Schorsch told ABC News.

'This is turning into a social phenomenon and I had to put an end to it.'

He had heard about a 'pay it forward' streak at the same Starbucks the previous day that ended on customer 359. 

Schorsch didn't end the chain to be stingy, he said, adding that he tipped the barista $100.

'This is turning into something ridiculous and cheesy,' Schorsch told ABC. 'It just seems like a "first World" problem to me. Middle-class people sitting in their cars at a drive-thru, sipping a $5 drink and worrying about someone breaking the ranks.'

A woman started the act of kindness chain that lasted for hours at the Starbucks drive-thru on Thursday.

She ordered an iced coffee around 7 a.m. Thursday in St. Petersburg and asked to pay for the caramel macchiato for the stranger in the car behind her.

'First world problems': Schorsch thinks that if people really want to be charitable, helping the homeless would be more useful than paying for people's coffee in a drive-through queue

He returned the favor. The chain kept going as employees began keeping count.

The chain finally ended around 6 p.m. when customer number 379 pulled up and ordered a regular coffee.

Barista Vu Nguyen leaned out the window and explained the chain that started earlier in the day, asking if she'd like to participate. She declined, saying she only wanted to pay for her coffee.

Nguyen says he doesn't believe she understood the concept of paying it forward.

But Schorsch certainly did.

'There is a little humor being a contrarian, but I think if you really want to help, find someone that obviously needs help, like the homeless,' Schorsch, a blogger and part-time political advisor told ABC News.
