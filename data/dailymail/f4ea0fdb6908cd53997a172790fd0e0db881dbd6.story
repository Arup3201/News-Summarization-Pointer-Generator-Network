A woman and her two children have died after she jumped from the 30th floor of an apartment building while holding her daughters, aged one and two, following a row with her boyfriend.

The father of the two girls, Carlos Pinto, 33, needed to be sedated after his partner Lucia Brum Padilla grabbed their two daughters and jumped off the balcony of their flat, killing herself and the girls.

Mr Pinto and Ms Padilla, 20, both from Uruguay, were living in the Chilean capital Santiago.

Neighbours reported hearing the couple shouting and screaming at each other about his friendship with another woman.

They realised things had spiralled out of control when they heard screams and passers-by saw the young woman clutching her two daughters - aged one and two - as she fell.

The neighbours ran into the flat where they found Mr Pinto hysterical and restrained him as he then tried to jump from the building, located in Santiago's Estacion Central neighbourhood.

Neighbour Casiana Collazo Armas, who was friends with the young woman, told local TV: 'She had been depressed and was unhappy about a number of things.

'The couple had been together for years and had lived here in Chile since 2012 although they had never legally married.'

Uruguayan ambassador Rodolfo Camarosano said: 'We are in permanent contact with the father of the babies, with his brother and with the woman's family in Uruguay. Mr Pinto is in a very bad state.'

Police have started an investigation to find out the exact circumstances of the incident.
