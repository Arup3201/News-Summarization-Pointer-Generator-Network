Formula One's World Championship leader Nico Rosberg has been forced to ditch his limited edition helmet designed to celebrate Germany's World Cup triumph.

Rosberg planned to wear the lid, emblazoned with the Germany flag, World Cup trophy, and four stars to celebrate each of his nation's World Cup wins following their 1-0 win over Argentina at this weekend's German Grand Prix.

But the 29-year-old, who leads Lewis Hamilton in the World Championship by four points, is not allowed to carry an image of the World Cup after football's governing body FIFA expressed their grievances over issues with the copyright.

'We appreciate Nico Rosberg's desire to 
congratulate the German team and have therefore been in discussions with
 the Rosberg team to attempt to find a solution, whereby he is still 
able to show his support for Germany without using FIFA intellectual 
property in a commercial context,' a FIFA spokesperson said.

The German's helmet has since been re-designed, carrying four stars to mark Germany's World Cup triumphs in 1954,1974, 1990 and 2014 instead.

'It is a shame,' said Robserg. 'I would have loved to carry the trophy as a tribute to the guys, but of course I respect the legal situation.'

His Mercedes team also paid tribute to the World Cup winners with a message for Joachim Low's triumphant side on their motorhome at this weekend's race. 

Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan have sporting officials been such party-poopers.

FIFA have ordered Formula One World Championship leader Nico Rosberg to remove an image of the World Cup trophy from his helmet.

Rosberg tweeted earlier in the week that he was planning to wear the design at this  weekend’s Grand Prix at Hockenheim in homage to the victory of the German football team.

A piece of harmless fun? Not for FIFA. Their spokesman confirmed: ‘FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context. We cannot allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the FIFA World Cup trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates.’

This rebuke prompted Rosberg into a swift redesign. 

Winners: Mercedes marked the occasion with a special message on the side of their paddock motorhome

Rosberg arrives at this weekend's race in Hockeheim hoping to bounce back from his first DNF of the season at the British Grand Prix.  

Hamilton won in front of his home crowd at Silverstone to blow the title race wide open after Rosberg retried with a gearbox problem.

'Unfortunately my gearbox broke during the race and Lewis went on to win,' Rosberg wrote in his column for MailOnline. 

'Naturally, there was then a lot of 
interest in whether I would have won the race had I not suffered my 
first DNF of the season.

'It is impossible to say, but let us give the benefit to the guy who was leading. I was doing well at the time, so I was pretty confident I could have made it happen and stayed out in front.'

Rosberg married his long-term girlfriend Vivian Sibold at a ceremony in Monaco last week before putting pen to paper on a new deal with Mercedes on Wednesday.

'This is the place where I want to be. I feel very much at home here, and they have shown a lot of faith and respect in me and it is a great collaboration, so I am looking forward to many more successful years with the team,' he added.

'I am also enjoying the moment, because is special knowing that if I do a good job at each race I can be on pole and if I do a good job on Sunday I will win the grand prix. It doesn't get better than that.'
