Jermain Taylor has been released on bail after firing a gun in the air and allegedly threatening to shoot three children under the age of six.

The former unified middleweight champion of the world was arrested on Monday following the incident in Little Rock, Arkansas.

After initially posing for a photograph during the city’s Martin Luther King Junior Day parade, the mood changed when one of his belts fell to the ground.

Jermain Taylor was arrested on Monday and later released on bail following the incident in Arkansas

The boxer, who currently holds the IBF middleweight title, fired two shots in the air.

The children’s mother, Toya Smith, said: ‘He bent down to give my son the belt and he almost fell over and dropped the belt, and he thought my baby dropped the belt.

‘He put (the gun) up against his (her husband’s) temple, I jumped in front of it and it went off up into the air.

‘He was going to shoot him, but I saw it, he was going to kill him and I had to hit the gun.’

The family attempted to leave but Taylor continued to point the gun in their direction.

Taylor has previously fought Carl Froch during a 2009 bout for the WBC Super Middleweight Championship

‘He was pointing at the kids, so I jumped in front of him again and said, “please don’t shoot my kids,”’ Smith said.

Taylor was later arrested and found to have a gun and a small amount of marijuana in his possession.

He was charged with aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a minor and possession of the drug.

Taylor was due to make the first defence of his title against Sergio Mora on February 6 but that fight has been scrapped.

The 36-year-old is also due to face trial in June over the alleged shooting of his cousin last August.

Tyrone Hinton was shot multiple times and Taylor was charged with first-degree domestic assault and aggravated assault.
