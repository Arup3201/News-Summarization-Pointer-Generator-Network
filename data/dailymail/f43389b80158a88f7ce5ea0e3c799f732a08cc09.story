A British pensioner was sentenced to death for drug smuggling by an Egyptian court yesterday.

The Foreign Office said it was ‘extremely concerned’ about the sentence passed on 74-year-old Charles Raymond Ferndale, said to be a graduate of the Royal College of Art and Oxford University.

He was originally sentenced to death on April 7 with four other men.

The sentences were confirmed by a 
court in Hurghada, a tourist city on the Red Sea coast, yesterday where a
 fine of 85million Egyptian pounds (£8million) was also imposed.

Executions in Egypt are usually carried out by hanging.

Ferndale, who is said to divide his 
time between the UK and Pakistan, was accused of attempting to smuggle 
three tons of the cannabis product hashish, worth almost £3million, in 
118 bags into Egypt aboard his boat and being part of an ‘international 
gang’.

The pensioner, three men from the 
Seychelles and one from Pakistan were arrested by armed police aboard a 
vessel near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam in 2011.

The Pakistani man is said to have fled the scene and to have been sentenced to death in absentia.
Positioned in south-eastern Egypt, and located on the western shore of 
the Red Sea, Marsa Alam is a popular spot for tourists and in particular
 yachts and sailors.

Egyptian investigators said that they
 boarded Ferndale’s vessel and discovered the hashish hidden and in 
sacks disguised as food supplies.

Some reports described the vessel as a yacht, others a small ship.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances.

Our consular team in Cairo are in contact with the British prisoner and we will do our utmost to prevent this execution.’

Ferndale, who is said to have been 
living mostly in the Pakistan port city of Karachi, and those convicted 
with him are expected to lodge an appeal against the sentence within the
 next 28 days.

Egyptian officials said yesterday 
they believed the bags of hashish had originated in Pakistan although a 
spokesman in the capital Islamabad said it was unaware of the case.

Anti-death penalty campaigner Kim Manning Cooper, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘This is extremely worrying news.

‘The death penalty is cruel and 
unnecessary in all circumstances, but international standards clearly 
stipulate that capital punishment should never be imposed in non-lethal 
cases like this one.

‘We will be pressing for the sentence against Mr Ferndale and the others in this case to be commuted.

‘Executions were something we saw 
almost every year in Egypt during Hosni Mubarak’s long authoritarian 
rule. Egypt should immediately impose a complete moratorium on the death
 penalty.’

Arrest: The case dates back to 2011 when four of the defendants were arrested on board a ship near the Red Sea coastal town of Marsa Alam

Fine: The court in the city of Hurghada also imposed a fine of 85 million Egyptian pounds (£850,000)

Amnesty claims that 91  people were 
sentenced to death in Egypt last year, although it is not thought that 
anyone has been executed for two years.

There have been no executions of Europeans for more than 20 years, officials in Cairo said.

There is also concern over fair 
trials in the country. A recent report claims that some 1,100 people 
failed to get a fair trial from the Egyptian courts in the past year.

In recent years, Ferndale has written
 for both the British and Pakistani media on subjects including 
terrorism, Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, the Middle East and Afghanistan.

He claims to have a degree from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and lists his occupation as charity worker.

The other men convicted in Egypt were
 named as Ronny Norman Jean, 41, Yvon John Vinda, 38, Dean Dominic Loze,
 27, all from the Seychelles, and Munawar Saeed Khan, 44, from Pakistan.

Ferndale’s case mirrors in some ways the plight of British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford.

She is in a Bali jail having been 
sentenced to death – by firing squad – after being convicted of trying 
to smuggle cocaine on to the holiday island in May 2012.

The 56-year-old is appealing against the death sentence.
