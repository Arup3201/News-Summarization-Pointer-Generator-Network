A journalist is facing financial ruin after he blew up the engine of a £1.3million Porsche he had borrowed from a former Formula One driver.

Mark Hales was testing the powerful vehicle belonging to David Piper for a magazine article when he accidentally over-revved the engine.

He claimed that the veteran driver had agreed to cover the bill for the damage, but a High Court judge ruled yesterday that Mr Hales was responsible for the breakdown and ordered him to pay more than £100,000 in damages and costs.

The writer has complained that the huge bill will bankrupt him - though it would hardly make a dent in the fortune of Britain's best-known motoring journalist Jeremy Clarkson, who earns more than £1million a year thanks to his work on Top Gear and multiple books.

Damaged: This £1.3million replica of a Porsche 917 had its engine blow up after being over-revved by Mr Hales

Mr Hales, 62, who is himself an experienced race driver, borrowed Mr Piper's Porsche 917 replica for a feature comparing it with a classic Ferrari owned by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason.

He took the two cars to Cadwell Park in Lincolnshire in April 2009 in preparation for the article which was set to appear in Octane and Auto Italia magazines.

But as he was changing gear he revved the engine too much, causing it to break down entirely.

Mr Hales is adamant that he had a deal with Mr Piper, 82, who raced for the Lotus F1 team in 1959 and 1960, and that as a rule owners take care of mechanical problems while drivers pay for crashes.

He said he had been having difficulties with the car, and claimed that as he changed from second to third gear it 'popped out', causing the engine to over-rev and blow up.

'The Porsche 917 is a tough car to drive and it is a matter of fact that the engines blow up,' he said. 'Everyone has done it and I knew this was the case.

'I had a conversation with David Piper and he asked me what happens if the engine blows up. I told him I couldn't be responsible and he said OK, but then chose to forget the conversation.

'If you crash the car you repair it but if it is mechanical you don't. It was a gentleman's agreement and I didn't write it down. I had a similar agreement with Nick Mason for the Ferrari of his which I was driving.'

Mr Piper had the Porsche repaired by a German specialist at a cost of £37,000, before selling the replica race car last year for £1.3million. He also owns an original 917, valued at £5million.

The Porsche 917, pictured, first entered competition in 1969, and quickly became one the German company's most iconic models.

With a top speed of more than 240mph, the car was driven to victory at the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1970 and 1971.

The car was powered by a five-litre engine, and could accelerate from 0-62mph in just 2.3 seconds.

The 917 was brought to wider audience beyond petrol-heads after it appeared in the film Le Mans, released in 1971 starring Steve McQueen.

Most of the film is taken up with footage of the 917 racing alongside other classic cars, showing off the model's smart design and innovative mechanics.

In his findings, judge Simon Brown blamed Mr Hales for failing to 'properly engage gear having been expressly told to do so and specifically warned about the risk of serious damage to the car if this was not done'.

He added: 'His level of driving - on this particular occasion - fell below the standard of care, albeit high, required of him.'

Mr Piper's lawyers said their client was pleased at the decision and intended to recoup the £48,000 in damages and £63,000 of other costs which the court ordered Mr Hales to pay.

The journalist said: 'I've sold everything to pay my lawyers and if he chooses to enforce the findings it is bankruptcy for me.'

He added: 'It was clear he wanted his day in court and the judgement was an absolute disgrace.

'This isn't what happens when you lend your race car to someone with no money but the judge didn't accept it.'

Mr Hales spoke of his gratitude at readers of a motoring website who are planning to set up a fund to help meet his costs.

'I have been left overwhelmed with the kindness from people planning on setting up a fund,' he said.

'I am very grateful and I may have to use it. If he drops the judgement then any money would go back to the people who donated or given to charity.'
