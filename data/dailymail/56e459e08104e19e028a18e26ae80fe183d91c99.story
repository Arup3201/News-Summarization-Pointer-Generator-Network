One of the childhood homes rapper Eminem lived in in one of the many impoverished areas of Detroit is up for sale - and there are calls for the 8 Mile star to invest in his old 'hood and buy it himself.

The home, at 19946 Dresden, was featured on the cover of his 2000 album, the Marshall Mathers LP, and is located just south of 8 Mile Road on Detroit's east side.

The house currently is vacant, and is little more than a boarded-up, 767-square-foot shack. The minimum bid for the property currently stands at $1.

Blight: The home - like many around it - currently is vacant and run down

Famous 'hood: Eminem used the home as the backdrop for his 2000 album cover, The Marshall Mathers LP

According to the Detroit Free Press, the metal porch roof and downspout are missing, and the fake stone facade is stained.

The house is one of more than 11,000 vacant properties in Detroit owned by the Michigan Land Bank, a state-run agency that manages vacant properties in some of the city's most decaying neighborhoods.   

Eminem's mother bought the property in 1987 for $19,000 in an agreement that required who to pay the couple who owned it $3,000 upfront and $220 a month.

Ms. Mather's was issued a deed for the house in 1994, and turned it over to Ann Investment the same day.

According to the paper, 'the property changed hands about 10 times before the Wayne County 
Treasurer’s Office foreclosed for non-payment of taxes in 2001. A 
company listed as EM & UU Properties bought the house for $1 in 
2009.'

Cheap: The home failed to sell for the minimum bid of $500 last year (before people knew it was Eminem's old place)

Last year, when the home failed to sell for the minimum bid of $500 - like more than 4,000 other homes in the area - the Treasurer's Office turned it over to Land Bank.

The home is currently valued at $32,675, according to the website Zillow.com.

'In a case like this, if the property is blighted, or the whole 
neighborhood is blighted, it would be unusual to get a buyer,' said Kim Homan, executive director of the Michigan Land Bank. 'Nobody knew it was Eminem’s home, either. But with the 
neighborhood being rough...'

Humble beginnings: One neighbor wants Eminem to buy the house and donate it to a homeless family in Detroit

One neighbor, Rhonda Brown, says she'd like to see Eminem buy the home, fix it up and donate it to a city resident.

'It’s sad to see things like this, especially when you made it 
successful,' she told the paper. 'My little coins, I put together and try to give 
back. Why (can’t) millionaires ... do that? One or two of us is not 
going to work. We need a load full of people who still have passion, 
still have love for Detroit.'
