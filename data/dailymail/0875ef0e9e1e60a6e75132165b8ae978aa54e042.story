Principal Tina Munoz of Zilwaukee International Studies School is a woman of her word.

The principal of the Michigan school made a deal with her students that if they could raise $12,000 for new school supplies, she would plant a kiss on the mouth of a pig.

After her students raised more than $27,000, Munoz had no choice but to make good on her promise.

Forfeit: Principal Tina Munoz bent down and puckered up with a pig called Jimmy Dean after her students raised $27,000 for school supplies

Embrace: Though slightly embarrassed, Munoz said she was more than happy to kiss the pig since it was for a good cause

Standing in front of her student, Munoz knelt down and put a peck on the mouth of Jimmy Dean.

Adding insult to injury, Dean was made up with a touch of lipstick.

The students managed to keep their side of the deal by selling wrapping paper and food to the local community.

Though slightly embarrassed, Munoz said she was more than happy to do so since it was for a good cause.

'It was an experience,' she told WNEM in Michigan. 'Nothing what I thought it would be like. You know, you get yourself a little nervous.

Gross: The audience cheered when the principal got up and wiped the pig's lipstick off her mouth

'But I'm always taking care of my dogs and kissing my dogs at home. So it's just like another pet kissing at home.'

Munoz is not the only school administrator to put their school before their pride. And it turns out kissing pigs seems to be a popular punishment for many principals.

Just a day before Munoz kissed her pig, principal Luke Hogue of W.A. Kendrick Elementary School in California planted a kiss on a pig of his own, celebrating the school’s strong test scores.

And just three days before that, Peter McDougal, principal of Cedaroak Park Primary School in Oregon, kissed Precious the Pig after his students raised $12,400 as part of a charity fun run.
