A study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person's mental faculties to those of a small child, such as reacting emotionally

If you've ever felt so stressed at work you've considered throwing a tantrum, sulking or walking out, then you're not alone. 

A study has found that having to cope with stressful tasks can reduce a person's mental faculties to those of a small child. 

During tests, high levels of acute stress were found to lower the brain's ability to think critically, reason, and make practical decisions. 

These are traits typically seen in small children who have to respond emotionally to situations they find difficult, said the study.

Researchers from Brighton-based Mindlab, which carried out the study for healthcare providers Benenden Health, asked 200 volunteers to take part in mental agility trials.

The group was split in half, and 100 participants additionally took part in a series of stress-inducing tasks before and in-between the trials.

The results 'overwhelmingly' showed that stressed participants were more likely to make a wrong decision.

They regularly chose the wrong answer, or reacted emotionally by making snap judgments based on a gut feeling. 

Toddlers typically respond in a similar way, emotionally, to problems they find hard to understand, instead of arriving at a considered logical solution, said the researchers.

Neuroscientist Dr David Lewis, director of Mindlab, said: 'When stressed, the focus of our attention tends to narrow and, if associated with strong emotions, we tend to act less rationally on occasions.

During trials, in which 100 volunteers were put through stress-inducing tasks, results overwhelmingly' showed stressed participants were more likely to react emotionally. Acute stress was also found to lower their ability to think critically, reason, and make decisions. Such traits are similar to those seen in toddlers (stock image)

Toddlers typically respond emotionally to problems they find hard to understand, instead of arriving at a considered logical solution in a similar way, said the researchers.

'Of course, this depends both on the stressor and other factors such as personality and the coping strategies available to the individual. 

'When stress arises unexpectedly, and is especially overwhelming, rational thinking tends to be replaced by impulsive and often faulty decision making.

'This can be compared to a small child who responds emotionally to situations he or she finds stressful and frustrating.'

Richard Carlton-Crabtree, from Benenden Health's counselling service provider, Insight Healthcare, added: 'Many people harbour the view that a little bit of stress may be healthy as the added pressure that stress causes can positively affect their performance.

'But this research shows that even small amounts of stress can have negative effects.

'This should reassure people that they should seek help and support when the onset of stress begins, because it can have a detrimental effect from day one acted correctly.'
