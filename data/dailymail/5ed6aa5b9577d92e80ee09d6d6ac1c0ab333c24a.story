Plummeting overnight temperatures caused a bitterly cold start to the week with layers of frost creating spectacular scenes across the country this morning.

After yesterday's torrential rain - which left parts of the South East of England submerged - a clear night brought temperatures as low as -4C in some parts of Britain last night.

Beautiful dawn scenes were captured in parks around London and in fields in Wales and the south of England this morning as the rising sun began to melt layers of overnight frost.

Despite the sharp drop in temperature, the Met Office say the weather is likely to get steadily warmer with daytime recordings creeping back into double figures by the end of the week.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'As we predicted today was a particularly frosty start but after a chilly dawn a warmer day will develop.

'A band of rain will begin to move in to western Scotland in the afternoon, later on Monday the risk of some thicker cloud and rain threatens some southern coastal counties as well, pushing north.

‘That rain is more likely to come overnight … and where there are clear skies there may also be a risk of frost.

A Met Office spokesman said: 'Tonight we're looking at temperatures of around freezing and in the highest parts of Scotland it could be -1C'

Despite today's frosty start, forecasters said temperatures will remain average for this time of year. In fact the rest of November is expected to stay relatively mild.

It may simply feel colder because of the remarkably warm autumn the UK has enjoyed. Meteogroup’s Tony Conlan said: ‘It is certainly going to be somewhat colder but not particularly cold for the time of year. It has been a mild month and it is looking like it is going to be a mild month overall.’

Tuesday is set to be the coldest day of the week with average temperatures of 5-8C (41-46F). A band of rain will move up the country from the South.

As the sun rose this morning, the clear skies and frost on the ground created beautiful scenes in Wembley and Hampstead Heath in London.

Misty landscapes were also captured in Cornwall and Bristol and Windsor - where a dramatic haze of overnight fog had settled on the River Thames.

Yesterday's flash flooding left parts of the UK submerged as the country was battered by torrential downpours and strong winds - with dozens of flood alerts issued.

Up to 30mm of rain fell in parts of the South yesterday, leaving the worst-affected areas submerged in several feet of water. The Environment Agency had last night issued 56 flood alerts – the lowest level warning – mostly centred on rivers in the South-East.

A further 22 flood alerts were in place around the Anglian region.

One unlucky motorist in Billericay, Essex, had to be rescued by a tractor after his Land Rover became submerged in deep water.

The capital experienced some of the heaviest rainfall. Fire crews in Lewisham, south-east London, had to pump out water by the River Ravensbourne over fears nearby houses could be swamped.
