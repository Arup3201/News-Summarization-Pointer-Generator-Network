Boris Johnson tonight launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners.

He swept into the Tory party conference tonight, with senior party aides hoping he will do away with the nervous jitters caused by UKIP defections and Labour's poll lead.

The London Mayor addressed a rally of Conservative activists tonight, mocking UKIP supporters and suggesting Nigel Farage should switch to become a Conservative.

London Mayor Boris Johnson tore into UKIP supporters and defectors as he addressed a rally at the Tory party conference

Mr Johnson was cheered enthusiastically by Tory activists as he took the fight to the UKIP defectors who have overshadowed the start of the conference

Mr Johnson vowed to take on the 'quitters, the splitters, the kippers' who are trying to undermine the Tory party.

And he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke. He told delighted Tory activists:'The EU commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful.

‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage.

‘And I have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to UKIP – who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’

David Cameron is understood to be enraged by the behaviour of Tory MP Mark Reckless, who tried to derail the start of the conference by announcing he was defecting to Ukip. 

The Prime Minister is said to have erupted during one private reception at the conference about the MP sitting on his ‘fat a***’ and relying on activists’ hard work to get elected, only to betray their trust.

He was also alleged to have called Mr Reckless a ‘d***h***’.

The outspoken remark is likely to infuriate UKIP supporters, and will draw comparisons to when defence minister Anna Soubry said of Mr Farage: 'I always think he looks like somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it.'

Mr Johnson pulled a remarkable face when asked what is the worse thing he has ever forgotten: he eventually recalled forgetting his mother's birthday

Tory strategists hope his arrival at the annual conference will deflect attention from the defection of two Tory MPs to UKIP

David Cameron is expected to pose for photographs with his old friend - and leadership rival - in an attempt to show he is one of the 'stars in the team'.

Mr Johnson was in Birmingham this evening at an event entitled: 'How we win in 2015.'

It is be the first time he has addressed the conference since announcing his plan to stand for election to Parliament in 2015.

Mr Johnson said: 'I say to those who made headlines in the last few days – the quitters, and the splitters and the kippers – there’s only one party that’s going to sort out the European issue and there’s only one party that’s going to sort out the constitutional anomaly that allows Scottish MPs to vote on matters that only affect England when English MPs have no corresponding say over questions in Scotland.

'There’s only one party and there’s only one leader in our country who is going to sort that out and that is David Cameron,' Mr Johnson added. 

Mr Johnson also said he held a pub meeting with Mr Farage around 20 years ago when he was given 'vodka and caviar' and asked to defect.

He added: ‘I said “No, Nigel, you join us”. I repeat my message today, because it is only the Conservatives who are able to deliver the kind of things he is talking about and it is only if the great conservative family unites and we stop Ed Miliband seizing back control of this country that we will be able to deliver the referendum that this country wants and deserves.’

The London Mayor's address to conference delegates comes in the wake of two Tory MPs defecting to UKIP

The Mayor's speech, which got a standing ovation, came amid growing concern that more eurosceptic Tory MPs are planning to defect to UKIP.

Rebel backbencher Mark Reckless announced his decision to leave the Conservative Party at the UKIP conference in Doncaster on Saturday.

He became the second sitting Tory to leave for Nigel Farage's party, following Douglas Carswell's defection last month.

Mr Reckless's defection, sparking a by-election in the Kent seat of Rochester and Strood, was the first of two blows for the Prime Minister at the start of this week's Conservative conference in Birmingham.

It came hours before charities minister Brooks Newmark was forced to resign after it emerged he had sent X-rated pictures of himself to an undercover reporter.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the party was in talks with more MPs to defect after Mark Reckless left the Tories on Saturday

Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party

He has already given his fulsome backing to Chancellor George Osborne, who used his speech to conference at lunchtime to announce £25billion in spending cuts, including £billion from freezing benefits for two years. 

Speaking during a visit to a factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme on his way to the conference, London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'If you want to have the cash to pay for the whole of society, then you need the economy to be going gang-busters.

'The most important thing for us in the UK economy is you've got to reform welfare and it's quite right that you should be looking at ways of improving how it's spent, but you've got to get the economy moving because that's the way to pay for the whole she-bang.'

Earlier Mr Johnson tried his hand at making bricks during a visit to Newcastle-under-Lyne

He spent some time closely inspecting rows of unfired brick ready for cutting during a visit to Ibstock Brick Ltd

The Mayor even made, and signed, a brick which was then fired at the factory

Mr Johnson has been selected as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - a safe Tory seat - and hopes to return to government when his term as Mayor ends in 2016.

This week Mr Cameron made clear Mr Johnson would have to remain on the backbenches until he has left City Hall.  

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'He's got to finish his term as Mayor of London. I know that's what he wants to do and I believe you can be a Member of Parliament and Mayor of London and do a very effective job. 

'But once he's finished that, then you know he's a star and, as I've always said, I want to have the stars in the team.'

Boris Johnson laid out a challenge to David Cameron in a rallying cry to Tory voters making clear that he had no problem with Britain leaving the EU.

He said it was up to the Prime Minister to ‘deliver real change in Europe’ – including controls on EU immigration.

Mr Johnson said it was important to ‘sort out our relations with Europe’.

Boris Johnson today claimed it would be 'easy' to leave the EU and sign up to a free trade agreement

He said: ‘We all want reform. We want sensible control of the number of people coming in. It is the right and the duty of every state to have some idea of how many people want to settle in its boundaries, what jobs they propose to do there and how much it is going to cost its local authorities.’

The London Mayor’s remarks come amid growing embarrassment within the Tory hierarchy over the Government’s failure to cut net migration – which is back above 200,000 a year.

Mr Cameron pledged to slash net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ a year.

The London Mayor – who is the Tory candidate in Uxbridge and South Ruislip – also said it would be ‘easy’ for Britain to leave the EU but stay in a free trade zone.

He said the single biggest problem which eurosceptics had to allay about leaving the EU was ‘the anxieties of international investors into this country’.

Mr Johnson said: ‘In an ideal situation what I would like to see is a reformed EU where we remain squarely at the heart [of the EU].’

But he said: ‘If we couldn’t remain in the current EU we would remain within that free trade zone.

‘I think it would be very easy to set up a free-trade, tariff free zone – so for international investors they would have that reassurance.

‘It’s perfectly possible to construct a vision for this country, where we do better and better on our wits, on our fantastic ability to innovate.’

He added: ‘The EU as a percentage of global GDP has declined over the past 20 years – from about 29 per cent to about 19 per cent. It’s going down and down and down – as the potential target for our exports, that doesn’t mean it is not incredibly important.

‘What I am trying to argue, we could remain on either view in the single market and it would be absolutely insane and self-destructive of the other major nations to want to kick us out.’

He said it was ‘up to use and up to David Cameron to deliver a real change in Europe’
