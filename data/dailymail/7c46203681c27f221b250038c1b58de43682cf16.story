Nigella Lawson admitted taking cocaine and cannabis but has not faced prosecution

Charles Saatchi's PR adviser has suggested Nigella Lawson has the Prime Minister to thank for not being investigated by police after she confessed to taking drugs.

Richard Hillgrove has claimed on his blog, the Daily Hillgrove, that the Prime Minister helped persuade the Metropolitan Police not to prosecute Miss Lawson after she admitted taking cocaine and cannabis. 

He wrote: 'It is understood from a source close to No. 10 that Prime Minister David Cameron made personal intervention to stop the MPS further investigating Nigella Lawson after her drugs admission.

'Cameron’s personal intervention is believed to be what influenced the MPS’s initial climb down of 27th January 2014.'

He also suggests George Osborne's close ties with Miss Lawson's father, Lord Nigel Lawson, could 'have conceivably been a factor in the decision to drop the prosecution of Nigella Lawson.'

A spokesman for Downing Street told 
The Telegraph: 'I think these decisions around prosecutions are always 
and entirely and wholly a matter for the prosecuting authorities.'

While a Scotland Yard spokesman added: 'We are not prepared to discuss the case.'

Miss Lawson, 54, admitted in court last year that she had taken cocaine and used cannabis but Scotland Yard decided she would not face charges.

Jurors during the fraud trial of Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi's former personal assistants had to be told to ignore the Prime Minister after he declared he was a secret fan of the chef during proceedings.

During two gruelling days of testimony, Miss Lawson, 53, was asked: 'Are
 you or have you ever been a user of cocaine?'
She replied: 'I have never been a drug addict. I have never been a 
habitual user. But there were times in my life when I used cocaine'

Mr Cameron brushed aside her admission that she had snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis, hailing her as a ‘very funny and warm person’ who creates good recipes.

But his comments led to him becoming embroiled in the trial at Isleworth Crown Court, with the judge saying the Prime Minister caused proceedings to be 'wasted'.

Justice Robin Johnson told jurors in the trial of Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo it was 'of regret' when public figures commented about someone involved in a trial and urged them to only decide the case based on the evidence in court.

The sisters were accused of abusing their positions by spending £685,000 on credit cards belonging to the celebrity couple to buy designer goods and luxury holidays for themselves but they were cleared of fraud. 

Mr Saatchi and Miss Lawson divorced last year after pictures were published in June which appeared to show the millionaire art dealer ‘throttling’ his wife outside Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair, central London.
