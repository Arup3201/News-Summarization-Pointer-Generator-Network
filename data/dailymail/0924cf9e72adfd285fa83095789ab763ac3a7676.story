Marion Thorpe – the former wife of the Queen’s cousin, the Earl of Harewood, and the current wife of ex-Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe – has died aged 87.

Vienna-born Marion, who was fiercely loyal to her scandal-hit second husband during his trial for attempted murder, passed away on March 6.

She stood by her politician husband when he became the centre of a scandal which rocked the nation in 1971 after former male model Norman Scott claimed the pair had enjoyed a homosexual relationship ten years previously when such acts were illegal.

An internal party inquiry exonerated Mr Thorpe, but in 1976, the case hit the headlines once again when Mr Scott claimed the politician had conspired to have him killed.

Mr Scott, who was befriended by an airline pilot called Andrew Newton, claimed Newton tried to kill him on Exmoor, Devon.

As a result, Mr Thorpe was sensationally arrested and charged with attempted murder and conspiracy to murder at Minehead Police Station in 1978.

According to the prosecution, the Liberal leader had diverted money from party donors and arranged through a bizarre series of intermediaries — including a Welsh fruit-machine magnate and a cut-price carpet dealer — for Newton to murder his former lover.

When the case came to court a year later, Thorpe denied everything. After a notorious summing up by Mr Justice Cantley, who denounced Scott as a crook and a liar, the jury found Thorpe not guilty.

Marion supported her husband loyally throughout the ordeal and attended court every day to be by his side.

The couple, who owned a large 16th century house set in 1.5 acres of land in rural North Devon as well as a home in London, ducked out of the limelight following the scandal.

Prior to her marriage to Thorpe, acclaimed concert pianist Marion spent 18 years married to the Queen’s cousin, the Earl of Harewood.

The wedding ceremony, held at St Mark's Church, North Audley Street, London, in September 1949, was attended by several members of the Royal Family. Around 900 guests attended the reception at St James’s Palace and more than 500 policemen were drafted in for security.

Marion, who was born Maria Donata Nanetta Paulina Gustava Erwina Wilhelmine Stein in October 18 1926 to prominent Jewish musician Erwin Stein, grew up with a love of music.

During her early years she became close friends with composer Benjamin Britten after being introduced to her father.

She said: ‘I was impressed but my father knew a lot of musicians. I was quite spoilt by knowing people of distinction.’

In a rare interview with BBC Radio 3 last year, Marion described her great friendship with the musical creator.

She said: ‘My friendship with him did last a long time… it was marvellous. I don't know what I did right!

‘I was never frightened of Ben but I had great respect for him. He was a very easy person to get on with but you were careful about what you said about works he either liked or disliked, or his own works. You chose your words carefully.’

When a house fire left Marion and her parents homeless in 1944, Britten and his partner Peter Pears welcomed them into their flat in London where they stayed for two years.

She said: ‘I really got to know him well. At that time we shared an apartment on St John's Wood high street, my parents and I, Ben and Peter Pears. It was exciting as he played bits of it and we sang parts in bad voices.

‘We played [piano] duets together quite often, Peter and my father, me and Ben in various combinations, four-handed. It could be quite frightening.

‘I thought he was a great composer… all the other composers were rather jealous of him. I was his great champion.’
