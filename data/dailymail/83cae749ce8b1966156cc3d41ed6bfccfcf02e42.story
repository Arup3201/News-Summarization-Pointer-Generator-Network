A five-year-old boy was banned from his school canteen and allegedly given bread and water for lunch after the school refused to accept a 'late' dinner money payment from his mother.

Callum Slater, a pupil at Longmoor Community Primary School in Walton, Liverpool, usually goes to the school canteen each day for a tuna and cheese wrap, as well as a pick and mix salad from the salad bar.

But the young pupil was made to eat an alternative lunch outside his headteacher's office after his mother Lesley tried to pay his £9 dinner money five hours 'too late'.

Callum Slater, five, was made to sit outisde his headteacher's office and was given bread and water for lunch after his mother Lesley handed
 in the £9 payment for the forthcoming week's meals 'too late'

The school asks parents to pay money for the forthcoming week's meals by the Friday before.

But when Ms Slater tried to pay the amount at the end of the day, instead of in the morning, the school refused to accept it.

Despite assurances from the school that his mother's 'missed' payment would not leave her boy without the usual school dinner, Callum was stopped from eating in the school canteen the following week.

Callum’s 
grandmother Sheila said the family was now considering moving Callum to another school after she claims he was given a bread roll and water for his lunch. 

In a statement, a spokesman for the 
school denied the claims and said Callum had been given the same lunch 
as everyone else that day - which included a tuna baguette, juice and 
ice cream and fruit for dessert.

But the 68-year-old from Aintree, Liverpool, said: 'They gave him a brown barmcake and a glass of water. Callum was so upset and he was saying ‘what have I done?’

Longmoor Community Primary School in Walton, Liverpool, said the move was to stop children being embarrassed at not having their usual lunch and have now apologised for the incident

'When we took him to school the next day he kept saying ‘have I got to sit outside the headteacher’s room?’

'He’s
 only five so he’s not old enough to understand. He didn’t understand 
why he couldn’t sit with his best friend like he normally does.'

Mrs Slater said parents had not been told there was a time deadline for the payment and the only specification was that it was paid on Friday. The school confirmed there had been a 'misunderstanding' in regards to the payment.

Mrs Slater said her daughter was also reassured that Callum would still be given his lunch and would not be left on his own.

On the Monday, because his account was 'in credit' from a previously missed lunch, Callum was allowed to chose his lunch from the canteen.

'He’s
 only five so he’s not old enough to understand. He didn’t understand 
why he couldn’t sit with his best friend like he normally does'

But the following day, Mrs Slater said she discovered Callum had spent lunchtime on his own outside headteacher Alison Johnson’s room.

Callum was then given packed lunches all week until his mother could pay the next lunch money instalment the following Friday.

Mrs Slater said: 'It says in the school newsletter that the children’s dinner money has to be paid on a Friday but it doesn’t say what time.

'My daughter hadn’t forgotten all year but last Friday she forgot to take it in with her in the morning.

'When
 she went to pick him up at 3.30pm she went to the office but the 
headteacher said ‘you’re too late’. She said ‘it’s still Friday’ but she
 said it had to be in by lunchtime.

'They just wouldn’t take the money off us. He was being punished for something he hasn’t done and we want to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.'

The school said the move was to prevent 
children from being embarrassed in front of other pupils if they did not have
 their usual lunch.

The statement said: 'Pupils whose parents have forgotten to pay for school dinner are given a more basic packed lunch made up of a sandwich, a drink and a piece of fruit.

'To avoid embarrassment, pupils in this situation have their lunch away from other children. However, in this specific instance, due to a misunderstanding by a supply teacher, the child had the same lunch as every other pupil that day - a baguette, drink and a dessert.

'We have apologised to the parent and the child for any upset and confusion caused and taken steps to make sure the system for payment is communicated consistently in future.'
