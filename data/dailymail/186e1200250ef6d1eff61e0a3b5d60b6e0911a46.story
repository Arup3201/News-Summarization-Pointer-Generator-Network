A reading consultant at Sandy Hook Elementary School has recounted how the principal and school psychologist saved her life by confronting the gunman after he broke into the building.

Becky Virgalla was in a meeting with  Principal Dawn Hochsprung, school 
psychologist Mary Sherlach and other colleagues when the shooter opened fire on Friday December 14.

Mrs Hochsprung, Mrs Sherlach and lead teacher Natalie Hammond 'went out in the hall to check out the noise that we didn't know that was gunshots at first,' Mrs Virgalla said.

Saved: Speaking at a memorial for Sandy Hook victims, Becky Virgalla recounted hearing the gunshots ring out. Three members of staff ran out of the room and warned her: 'Shooter, stay put'

'The three of them were shot and they 
yelled back, "shooter, stay put",' she told Reuters. 'And they saved my life and the life of 
four others who were at that meeting.'

The gunman shot dead 20 children and six female staff members at the school in Newtown, Connecticut, making it in the second-worst mass shooting in U.S. history.

Before attacking the school with a 
military-style assault rifle, the gunman shot and killed his mother at their 
home. He took his own life at the school.

Among the victims were Mrs Hochsprung, 47, and Mrs Sherlach, 56, while Ms Hammond survived the attack.

Speaking at a memorial where the names of the victims were written on wooden angels, Mrs Virgalla, a married mother of two, said parents and teachers need to check their doors lock from the inside.

'Ours did not and teachers had to go out,' she said. 'You can't be out in a hall when a shooter is present in your school. Just that simple thing could make a difference in time and safety of the children.'

Since their deaths, the community has paid tribute to the courage of the principal and psychologist.

Mrs Hochsprung's daughter, Erica Lafferty, told the Today show last week that she was finding it 'tough' after learning her mother died when charging at the gunman.

'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' Lafferty said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on.

Warning: She said that all teachers need to make sure there are locks on the insides of doors at schools

'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

She went on: 'To say she was a wonderful person is the understatement of the century. She put her life into making everyone else's lives so much better. Her smile lit up every building she walked into.

'She made an impact on everyone that she's ever come across. Every adult, every child - especially the kids. [They were] the light of her life.'

As well as the women, other stories of heroism have emerged since the massacre.

Special needs teacher Anne Marie Murphy was found cradling the body of six-year-old Dylan Hockley, whom she died trying to save, while Vicki Soto died shielding her students from bullets.

Loss: The names of the victims are written on stockings. In total, 26 died, including 20 children

And in another story of bravery, fourth-grade teacher Ted Varga, 25, escaped the building but returned and helped three people escape by dislodging a wooden board on a window.

Mr Varga told the New York Daily News that as gunshots echoed through the hallways, a custodian ran around, warning people.

'He said, ''Guys! Get down! Hide!''' Mr Varga said. 'So he was actually a hero.'
