Thousands of people crammed into a small residential close to witness a spectacular Christmas lights switch-on.

Around 2,000 people packed into Byron Close in Milton, Hampshire, on Sunday night to see the huge display spread across twelve terraced houses.

The light show uses and estimated 1,000 bulbs and even features singing snowmen and rocking reindeer.

Local celebrities Richard Digance, who appears on Countdown's dictionary corner, and BBC Radio presenter Katie Martin even attended to help flick the switch.

The huge Christmas spectacular features twelve homes decorated with around 1,000 twinkling lights

Local resident Gedd Hollioke has organised the festive display in Byron Close for the last nine years

Display organiser Gedd Hollioke began organising this year's extravaganza in October.

He estimates the display will run up a £900 lighting bill between now and January 1.

But the 65 year-old builder claimed cost 'wasn't much of an issue' and said the display raised money for the Hampshire and Isle of Wight air ambulance.

And he even hit out at scrooge neighbours who refused to join in the festive fun by lighting up their homes. 

Mr Hollioke said:'I don’t think money is too much of an issue, the homeowners were over the moon when the lights were turned on.

'All the children watching had a great time too and were overwhelmed with excitement, especially as each one got a gift from Father Christmas.

'The street has been doing this for nine years now but this is easily the best year we’ve done yet.

'Our efforts raise money for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance and we’ve raised about £22,000 pounds up until now.'

He added: 'It was great that 12 of the street’s homes took part in the festive event but I wish the other homes would join in too.

'I do hope they will at some point though.'

The dazzling lights will run up an estimated £900 electricity bill between now and the switch-off on January 1

Organisers said local children were left 'overwhelmed with excitement' at seeing the huge wintry grotto
