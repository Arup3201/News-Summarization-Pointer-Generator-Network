Miriam Heyburn used to despair over her excruciating migraines, which struck every other day.

'I suffered from headaches since I was eight years old,' says Miriam, a retired court reporter from Croydon, Surrey, now in her 60s.

'They were so overwhelmingly painful that I never fully engaged with people at work. I had a reputation for being quiet and moody, but, in fact, I was trying to cope with the pain in my head.'

For years, Miriam relied on strong painkillers to cope, but worried about the long-term effects.

However, more recently she's been offered a new drug-free treatment which has reduced the severity of her migraines, and allowed her to cut back on her medication.

Miriam has been treated with trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, where magnetic pulses are directed into the head. Doctors are unsure exactly how TMS works in treating migraine, but one theory is that it stops abnormal electrical activity in the brain.

Earlier this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said there is enough scientific evidence to support the use of the treatment for the prevention and treatment of migraine.

Migraines affect one in four women and one in 12 men in the UK. Although the cause is not known, they involve sudden contraction and then dilation of blood vessels in the brain.

Unlike a normal headache, they are often accompanied by additional symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light, noise, touch and smell. They can also be preceded by aura, which can include flashing lights, zigzag lines in front of the eyes, and numbness or tingling in the limbs.

For Miriam, who sometimes felt nauseous when she had a migraine, standard painkillers had no effect. So she took the strongest medication, known as triptans, which work by causing the blood vessels around the brain to contract.

But as she reached her mid-50s, her headaches worsened, becoming more frequent and more severe, lasting two or three days at a time and often confining her to bed. If she was at work when a migraine hit, she would often have to rest in the sick room. And she was struggling with the side-effects of triptans, which can include nausea, a tight feeling in the chest and a 'spaced-out' feeling.

'It was like having a permanent headache - it was unbearable,' she says. 'I always carried my tablets with me. If I didn't take one I couldn't function. I couldn't take a day off work every time I had a headache or I'd never have been there.

'But the tablets made me feel as though I was walking in lead or wading through treacle. I had to take them so often that I was concerned what the long-term  side-effects could be.

'I tried acupuncture and head massage to try to cut down on the medication, but they  didn't help.'

In 2011, Miriam's GP referred her to a specialist headache clinic at London's Charing Cross Hospital, where she was seen by consultant neurologist Dr  Mark Weatherall.

She was prescribed various strong medications, including some usually used for treating epilepsy - thought to dampen down over-activity in the cells involved in generating migraine - but to no avail.

Then last June Dr Weatherall suggested she tried TMS. There are no known serious side-effects and the device is easy and safe to use, according to doctors.

Patients hold the portable device - which is about the weight of a brick and has a handle at each end - against their head at the base of the skull.

Pressing a button on the handle emits a single painless magnetic pulse. This passes through the skull at the back of the head and into the brain.

The number, strength, frequency and duration of pulses can also be adjusted for each individual user.

In a U.S. clinical trial with 164 patients treated with TMS for at least one attack of migraine, 40 per cent were pain-free after two hours. After 24 hours, 29 per cent were still pain free, and after 48 hours 27 per cent were still pain free. The results were presented to a meeting of the American Headache Society in 2008.

In a separate study in Canada, three-quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with TMS suffered fewer headaches. Some patients reported tingling in the head and light-headedness, but these typically lasted no longer than 30 minutes; there were no serious side-effects.

'About two-thirds of patients find the device helpful in reducing the intensity and/or the duration of their migraines,' says Dr Weatherall.

This is a 'breakthrough' treatment for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to current treatment, says consultant neurologist Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a trustee of The Migraine Trust. 'It opens the door for a new era in treating migraine headaches. We welcome NICE guidance and very much hope this treatment will be made available to those in need.'

For Miriam, there was one overwhelmingly good reason to give it a go.

'I was keen to try it because it was drug free,' she says.

After attending the headache clinic to learn how to operate it, she was allowed to take the device home to use whenever she felt a headache coming on, and is thrilled with the results.

'The device is marvellous. As soon as I started using it, my headaches became less frequent and less severe. I now often go ten days without suffering from a headache, which is such a relief. It has transformed my life.

'I still sometimes have to take a tablet for my headache, but not as often as before.'

The treatment's effectiveness depends on how soon it is given, the number of pulses and the patient's individual pattern of migraine symptoms. For most patients, it can take a few weeks to work out the optimal treatment pattern.

One possible downside is to do with practicality. 'It is a bit bulky, and its batteries have to be kept charged,' Dr Weatherall says.

'It does make a loud bang when you trigger it, but it's easy to use,' adds Miriam.

'You don't have to hold it for very long and it's done its job. I just wish it wasn't so heavy because I can't carry it when I go out.

'However, I still take my tablets everywhere with me, so I can take one if I get a headache when I'm out.'

Under NICE guidelines issued in January this year, TMS is approved for the treatment or prevention of migraine episodes in patients with acute or chronic migraine, with or without aura.

However, it is available only through specialist headache centres and is mostly restricted to patients who cannot use other forms of acute migraine treatment - for instance, who find drug treatment intolerable or for those who want to take fewer drugs for their migraine - during pregnancy, for example.

However, patients who have either a pacemaker or epilepsy should not use the device.

For Dr Weatherall, the gadget gives 'a glimpse of the future of migraine treatment'.

'It has an excellent safety record, and is a great option for patients who can't take standard painkillers or migraine treatments because of other medical issues.

'Understanding exactly how the TMS device works is opening up new avenues of research into migraine, which may in turn lead to new treatments for this common and disabling disorder.'
