Mr Miliband paid tribute to Mr Cottingham last month, telling Pink News: 'Paul Cottingham was a wonderful, bright, kind and funny man. A champion of equality, Paul always put others first. 

'A humanitarian. He was a man who always stood up for what he believed in and was always generous with the love and compassion he showed to others. 

'He was deeply committed to the Labour Party and did so much throughout his life to further the cause of social justice. 

'His civil partnership to Michael Cashman was a moment of great celebration for the whole Labour movement. All of our thoughts and love are with Michael and Paul's family today.'
