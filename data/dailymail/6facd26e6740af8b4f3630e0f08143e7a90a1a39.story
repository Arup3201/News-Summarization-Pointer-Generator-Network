The New York hospital where the city's first Ebola patient is being treated has denied claims that hoards of health workers have called in sick out of fear of contracting the deadly virus.

Bellevue Hospital Center, to which Dr Craig Spencer was admitted  on Thursday, was said to have suffered a staff shortage on Friday after a high number of medics failed to turn up for work.

According to The New York Post, the employees feared they might become infected with Ebola like the two Dallas nurses who treated victim Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on October 8.

However, hospital spokesman Ana Marengo has now denied there was any sickout, saying that nurses are willing treating Dr Spencer in pairs, 'with one serving as a buddy watching the other'.

Victim: Dr Spencer (pictured, left, in a hazmat suit, and, right, in his LinkedIn profile picture), is a Doctors Without Borders volunteer who has recently returning from aid work in Ebola-stricken Guinea, West Africa

Dr Spencer,  a Doctors Without Borders volunteer, was admitted to Bellevue after recently returning from aid work in Guinea, West Africa, which is Ground Zero for Ebola.

He was found to have a 100.3-degree fever, one of the primary symptoms of infection, and later tested positive for the virus. He is currently undergoing treatment and is in a 'stable' condition.

Earlier today, a source told the newspaper that nurses are 'terrified' to enter the 'isolation chamber' where Dr Spencer is being treated for Ebola.

'The nurses on the floor are miserable with a ''why me?'' attitude, scared to death and overworked because all their co-workers called out sick,' said the source.

'One nurse even went as far as to pretend she was having a stroke to get out of working there, but once they cleared her in the ER they sent her back up.'

Dr Spencer, who remains in a stable condition, has reportedly been putting his medical skills to use by lecturing the staff about his treatment.

'As a doctor, he knows a lot about medicine, so he would call the nurse's station all day and going back and forth to the doctors on what to do,' the source said. 

Visits are forbidden and the victim's fiancée and two friends - who had been in close contact with him in the days leading up to his diagnosis - have been quarantined as a precaution.

His fiancée Morgan Dixon, 30, who lived with Dr Spencer, is also under isolation at the hospital.

Although the victim's doctors would not go into detail about his condition, New York City Mayor Bill di Blasio said on Thursday night that the patient was 'in good shape.'.

Hazardous: Specialty cleaners remove barrels from the Harlem apartment of Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer

Dr Spencer arrived in New York on October 17 - six days before he was admitted to hospital.

During that time he went bowling in Brooklyn, rode the subway and took a taxi, walked Manhattan's High Line and went to restaurants. 

He reportedly started feeling ill on Tuesday, but the fever did not develop until Thursday. He promptly called officials at Doctors Without Borders, who then called New York's health department.

Emergency health workers rushed to Spencer's apartment on West 147th Street, Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, in full protective gear.

Tragic: Earlier reports said Bellevue hospital staff called in sick on Friday out of fear they might develop Ebola like the two nurses who treated victim Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured), who died on October 8

He was taken to Bellevue about 1pm and his apartment was sealed off, with biohazard cleaners brought in. 

Earlier this month, nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were diagnosed with Ebola after caring for victim Mr Ducan, a 42-year-old Liberian, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

They have both since been declared 'Ebola-free': Miss Pham has been released, while Ms Vinson is still receiving supportive care at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia.

According to the latest figures, the Ebola death toll has now struck at least 4,922, bringing the total of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 10,141.

Most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, all in West Africa

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.
