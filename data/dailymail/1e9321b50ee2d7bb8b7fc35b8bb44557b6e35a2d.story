A team of nine Taliban militants who attacked a Pakistani air force base in Kamra in the northwest of the country have been killed during a heavy battle before dawn today.

The insurgents also killed a security official and left parts of the base, which is believed to be linked to the country's nuclear program, destroyed by flames.

Hours later in northern Pakistan, gunmen forced 20 Shiite Muslims off buses, lined them up and killed them.

The separate incidents emphasize two daunting challenges the nuclear-armed country faces: a still-potent threat from the Pakistani Taliban despite numerous military offensives against their sanctuaries along the Afghan border and sectarian violence in a Sunni majority country where Shiite Muslims often feel under attack.While the Pakistani Taliban have carried out hundreds of bombings and other attacks throughout the country, raids against military bases are uncommon.

The large air base, located only about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Islamabad, hosts a variety of fighter jets, including F-16s, and contains a factory that makes aircraft and other weapons systems.

Some experts suspect the base could be linked to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal because of the weapons development there and the presence of jets that could be used to deploy bombs.

The army has denied the base has any links, but the nuclear program's secret nature makes independent evaluation difficult.

Western experts say Pakistan has about one hundred nuclear weapons and is in the midst of a rapid expansion of its arsenal.U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said 'the great danger we've always feared is that if terrorism is not controlled in their country, those nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands.'

The militants, some of whom were wearing
explosives strapped to their bodies, attacked the base at around 2 a.m.
with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, according to the 
air force.

At least one of the rockets hit a 
hangar, pierced the hangar wall and exploded, damaging one of the 
aircraft parked inside, said air force spokesman, Tariq Mahmood.

After the rocket barrage, the attackers scaled the wall surrounding the air base and an intense firefight ensued.'

Security
forces, backed by a team of elite commandos, fought the militants for 
two hours and were finally able to retake the base.

By the end of the battle, one soldier was dead and the nine militants 
were killed, one of them when he blew himself up outside the base 
perimeter.

The head of the base, Air Commodore Muhammad Azam, was wounded in the shoulder, said Mahmood.

Security forces searching the area after the attack found a 'few IEDs,' which they removed or destroyed.

The base was once known as Air Force Base Minhas, named after a pilot, Rashid Minhas.

He was lauded as a hero in Pakistan for foiling attempts by his instructor to defect with an air force plane to arch rival India in 1971.

To stop the escape, Minhas disabled the controls of the plane the two were flying, and died in the resulting crash.Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan claimed responsibility for the air base attack.

He said it was revenge for the death of the group's leader Baitullah Mehsud in a U.S. drone strike in 2009 and the American commando raid that killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden last year.

He claimed the militants damaged three fighter jets.

The Pakistani Taliban have waged a bloody insurgency against the government for the past several years that has killed tens of thousands of people.

In response, the army has carried out numerous offensives against the Pakistani Taliban in the country's semi autonomous tribal area along the Afghan border.

They now appear to be planning an operation in the group's last major sanctuary in North Waziristan.Panetta said earlier this week that Pakistan has informed American military officials that it plans to launch an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in North Waziristan in the 'near future.'In the sectarian attack, gunmen forced 20 Shiites off three buses in the Naran Valley in northern Pakistan, shot and killed them, said a police official. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was worried about retribution.The Deputy Inspector General of police in Gilgit, Ali Sher, said the victims were traveling from Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, to Gilgit, a mostly Shiite area.

There have been several such sectarian attacks in the region in the past by Sunni extremists who do not view Shiites as true Muslims.

In February gunmen stopped a convoy of buses in the city of Manshera, ordered selected Shiite Muslim passengers to get off and then killed 16 of them.

In April, violence between Sunnis and Shiites killed 14 people in and around the town of Gilgit in northern Pakistan.
