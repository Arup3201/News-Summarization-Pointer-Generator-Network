Shelly Sterling says she has signed a binding contract to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for a record-breaking $2 billion (£1.2billion).

Sterling confirmed the agreement made between The Sterling Family Trust and Ballmer in a statement issued late on Thursday night.

The statement says she made the deal 'under her authority as the sole trustee of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers.'

Shelly Sterling negotiated the sale after the NBA banned her husband for life and fined him $2.5 million (£1.49million) for making racist remarks that became public.

Ballmer said in a statement that he loves basketball and will 'do everything in my power to ensure the Clippers continue to win - and win big - in Los Angeles.'

The deal would need to be approved by the NBA and the Clippers have yet to confirm the sale.

'I
 am delighted that we are selling the team to Steve, who will be a 
terrific owner,' Sterling said in a statement. 'We have worked for 33 
years to build the Clippers into a premiere NBA franchise. I am 
confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success.'

Ballmer also released a statement, saying that he was 'honoured' by the opportunity.

'I
 love basketball,' he said. 'And I intend to do everything in my power 
to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los 
Angeles. L.A. is one of the world's great cities -- a city that embraces
 inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace 
inclusiveness. I am confident that the Clippers will in the coming years
 become an even bigger part of the community.'
