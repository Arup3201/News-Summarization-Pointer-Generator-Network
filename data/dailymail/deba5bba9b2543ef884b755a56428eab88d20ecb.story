As patron of the homeless charity Centrepoint, Prince William has demonstrated once again that he takes his role more seriously than just being a figurehead.

He made a private visit to one of the charity's central London hostels last week to meet the staff and see how people are benefiting from their support.

The royal visit was without fanfare and press were not invited but the organisation today shared details of the prince's stay on their Facebook page writing, 'look who popped in!'

They wrote alongside an album of pictures of the prince: 'Our Patron, the Duke of Cambridge, visited one of our central London hostels to meet young people, chat about housing and positive futures, and play a little table tennis.'

The pictures show Prince William, 30, looking relaxed in jeans, a jumper and trainers as he mingles with the staff and young people.

He was given a tour of the hostel that included a visit to the kitchen where residents are taught how to cook on a budget and the importance of nutrition.

Lively debate: The charity said the youngsters didn't let the prince off lightly on issues of housing and barriers for young people

Time for tennis: William demonstrated his ping pong skills

Pro: The charity joked on their Facebook page that the prince was better at the game than their chief exec

William is firm friends with the CEO Seyi Obakin and joined him in a challenge to sleep rough in 2009 in aid of the charity

He sampled homemade smoothies and flapjacks made by Centrepoint's Patrick, who works with Zendegii - a social enterprise making healthy food and providing training and jobs for homeless young people.

He then met young people from the 
Centrepoint Parliament, a group of residents from across the charity's 
hostels which campaign on key issues for homeless young people - 
such as the cuts made to career advice provision.

The charity revealed that the prince 'told them that the work they did with our Centrepoint Parliament was very important and would affect and impact other young people in the future.'

Gift: The hostel gave the duke a present to take home with him which he unwrapped during his visit

Happy memory: The present was a picture of the prince's visit to the hostel in 2011 with the Duchess of Cambridge when he indulged in a 'swag dance'

The prince also met young people from Fully Focused, a youth-led production team which has been training young people from Centrepoint in the art of film-making.

The Duke of Cambridge has been patron of Centrepoint, the leading charity for homeless young people aged 16-25, since 2005 - a role previously held by his mother, Princess Diana. 

Centrepoint work with 1,000 young people a year in London and the north east, providing not only a safe place to stay, but also vital support in finding work, accessing education and tackling physical and mental health problems caused by homelessness.

Mingling: William smiles for the camera with Alex, a former Centrepoint Parliament member

On that occasion, the prince raised smiles all around when he joined in a hip hop style 'swag dance' with resident Vanessa Boateng, 19.

To commemorate the moment, the hostel presented William with a picture of him doing the dance during his latest visit.

The prince looked touched by the gift and posed for a picture of himself holding it up which the charity captioned on their Facebook page: 'Who remembers the swag dance? Prince William can never forget it now that he has this picture!' 

William rounded off his visit by spending time with more young people in the hostels' backyard and playing table tennis with Centrepoint's CEO Seyi Obakin, with whom he became friends after joining in a challenge to sleep rough to highlight youth homelessness in 2009.

Centrepoint added on their Facebook page that the latest visit from their 'amazing patron' was a 'brilliant day'.
