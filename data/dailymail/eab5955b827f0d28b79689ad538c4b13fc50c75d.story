Michael Schumacher is crying at the sound of his children's voices after starting to recognise faces showing that he is 'alive and understands', according to reports.

The seven-time Formula One world champion, who is making a 'long, slow recovery' after a skiing accident, apparently cries when he hears a known sound, including the voices of his wife Corinna, daughter Gina Maria and son Mick.

The news comes one year after his accident in the French Alps and as his family prepare to mark his 46th birthday at their home in Gland, Switzerland, where he has been recovering since June.

According to an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, the fact Schumacher is reacting with tears to his loved ones' voices is 'valuable news', after a year of seeming 'really far away'.

Writing in the paper, Giorgio Terruzi said: 'Schumi cries. And sometimes mysteriously. He cries when he hears his children, his wife's voice, his dogs. In the silence of that room, a tear runs down his thin face at a known sound.'

He added: 'Inside this we can find... There is life, enclosed in a drop; there is the strength of a man who is moved and that moves each of us. We have his tears, his senses exposed.'

Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps on December 29, 2013. The accident left him with brain damage and he was in a coma for six months.

Over the past year, Schumacher's family have released little information about his condition, describing only a 'long and difficult road' to recovery.  

But Terruzi's comments appear to have been supported by Autosprint's editor-in-chief Alberto Sabbatini, who also wrote in an editorial that Schumacher was making a 'very slow recovery'.

However, he warned that, while Schumacher has his eyes open, he is often looking 'into the void'.

'In recent times, he has been able to recognise the familiar faces of his family, but he cannot communicate with them,' he said.

Referring to the reports about Schumacher crying at certain sounds, he said: 'It shows that he feels emotion. That his brain works.

'It is the only way his strong character is able to externally convey an emotion. It is a sign that he is alive and understands, even if for now he is the prisoner of an immobile body.' 

Last week, Philippe Streiff, another former F1 driver, told French media that Schumacher ‘has yet to recover the power of speech’ but is ‘nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him’.

Streiff said he had learned of Schumacher's progress from his wife and his surgeon, Gerard Saillant.

Schumacher is said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair. He cannot speak and has memory problems, according to the former racing driver.

But Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying he faces a ‘long fight’ for recovery, and that Streiff is not a family friend.

‘We need a long time. It’s going to be a long time and a hard fight,’ Sabine Kehm said. 

Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened.

He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers.

But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates.  

It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock.

He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged.

The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident.

Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out.

He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run.

Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries.

He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma.

On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'.

He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. 

In October, a French doctor treating Schumacher said that the 45-year-old was making progress, but will need years to fully recover. 

Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'.

Schumacher's wife Corinna was a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years

 This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.
