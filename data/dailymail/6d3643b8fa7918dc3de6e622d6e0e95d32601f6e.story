Dangerous liaison: Lesley Ann Sharp was arrested for allegedly having sex with one of her 17-year-old students more than 25 times

A High school English teacher has been accused of having sex with one of her students more than 25 times.

Lesley Ann Sharp is also alleged to have exchanged thousands of sexually explicit text messages and photos with the 17-year-old.

Court documents say the 24-year-old had sex in her car, her apartment and the student's home when his parents were absent.

Sharp is also accused of exchanging thousands of messages of sexual content, including explicit photos.

The arrest affidavit listed a dozen obscene terms that were used more than 1,500 times in the text messages.

Sharp
and the student 'exchanged 116 telephone calls, 173 multimedia 
messages and 15,371 text messages' between May 2013 and July 2013, 
records show.

Officials in Collin County, Texas were able to retrieve the date after Sharp synced her iPhone and her school-owned laptop.

Before handing the computer over to investigators, Sharp deleted both 'iTunes and backup directories.'

The information was later found on the hard drive and police were able to recover data that proved the alleged affair.

Court
documents reveal that three days before her arrest, Sharp was told 
there was an investigation pending, and she warned the student to delete
all photos and messages.

Sharp,
who taught at the Hillcrest High School for just over a year, faces 
charges of improper relationship between educator and student, 
possession of child pornography, perjury and tampering with evidence.

Sharp has denied having sex with the student.

The
affair was discovered after the victim’s mother caught Sharp with her 
son at the apartment complex swimming pool where they live.

'Sharp engaged in the behaviors through a belief that she and student would never get caught,' the affidavit said.

Sharp’s mother, Rhonda Sharp, told The Dallas Morning News on Friday to 'stay away.'

We
don’t have a comment,' Rhonda Sharp said. 'Just that DISD should worry 
about other stuff instead of what they’re worrying about.'

The school's principal said he was 'stunned and saddened' by the teacher's arrest.

In
a letter to parents Ronald Hill said: 'Regretfully, it has been brought
to our attention that one of our staff members was recently arrested on
an allegation that she had an inappropriate relationship with one of 
our students. The teacher was new to our staff this year and is believed
to have had this relationship with only one student.

'We
are obviously stunned and saddened by this news but wanted to make sure
that you were aware of it. The teacher is currently on a leave of 
absence pending investigative conclusion and will not be returning to 
Hillcrest.'

Sharp was released on $29,500 bail.
