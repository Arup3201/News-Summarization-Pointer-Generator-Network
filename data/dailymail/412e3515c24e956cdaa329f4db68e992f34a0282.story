The groundhog might see his shadow on February 2 - but he won't be seeing Mayor Bill de Blasio.

A year after a groundhog slipped from Mr de Blasio's grasp during the annual Staten Island Zoo Groundhog Day ceremony, the zoo is reportedly making a change to prevent the mayor from handling the animal.

Mayor de Blasio, for one, would be happy with the new plan.

Chuck! Noooo! This is the moment New York Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped Staten Island's groundhog at the annual event in February last year. The animal later died of internal injuries, a post-mortem exam found

'I think reform is needed,' he joked during an unrelated news conference in Brooklyn yesterday. 'I welcome a new approach.'

A year ago, the creature squirmed from de Blasio's grasp after predicting six more weeks of winter and fell several feet to the ground. It died a week later.

A post-mortem revealed it suffered internal injuries, but it was not clear if they stemmed from the fall.

Moreover, it was revealed that the rodent that died was not the zoo's famed Staten Island Chuck, but rather a female stand-in named Charlotte.

The zoo did not notify the mayor's office about the death.

The story prompted a flood of Twitter jokes about a #Groundhoghazi cover-up and Mr de Blasio's possible impeachment.

And it wasn't even the first time a mayor had had an unfortunate run-in with a Staten Island groundhog: A squirming Chuck bit then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009.

Taking no chances: This year the zoo won't allow the mayor to hold the groundhog and it will instead be kept inside a plexiglass case to avoid any more unfortunate accidents 

This February the zoo is changing its ceremony so the mayor won't pick up the animal. Instead, it will be in a plexiglass case. A spokesman at the zoo declined to comment.

Last year was Mr de Blasio's first time participating in the ceremony. He admitted yesterday that he wasn't ready to handle the groundhog.

'I must say last time, there was not an overwhelming amount of preparation and orientation before I was handed him,' Mr de Blasio said. 'May he rest in peace.'

The zoo has four groundhogs, all with the variations of the brand name 'Chuck.' On the morning of February 2, zoo staff select which of the groundhogs will participate in the ceremony and be dubbed Chuck for the day.

The animal's formal name is Charles G. Hogg.
