Billionaire casino mogul James Packer has broken his silence and revealed his failed marriage, life in Hollywood and new plans for a multi-billion dollar business.

With dreams to build the world’s finest luxury brand, the 47-year-old revealed the Sydney based six-star hotel Barangaroo will cost $4.5 million per room.

'Some might say I’m a moron, but only time will tell,’ Packer said.

Speaking exclusively to The Sunday Mail, the father of three opened up about his heartbreak after his six-year marriage to wife Erica ended and now his children live in Los Angeles.

James Packer has broken his silence and revealed his failed marriage, life in Hollywood and business plans

While his Hollywood life involves mingling with stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, Packer said his main focus is being on dad duties for his children in LA as he works on his next project.

The Crown Resorts chairman is currently battling against business rivals in a bid to build a multi-billion dollar Queen’s Wharf site in Brisbane.

‘We (Crown) are trying to build hotels as good as anything in the world,’ Packer told The Sunday Mail.

‘If we can participate in Crown being central to the most vibrant precincts in the cities we work in, let alone the 15,000 jobs we provide in Australia, as Employer of the Year twice in four years, the tax we pay and the tourism we bring in, then I can be very proud of that.’

It’s understood Crown has teamed up with China’s Greenland Holdings in a joint venture to win the bidding war for the casino license in Brisbane.

Despite his plans going underway in the new year, the film financier grabbed global headlines after falling casino revenue affected his half-owned Crown Resorts, which led to nearly a $2 billion loss.

But his media spotlight didn't stop there - Packer was spotted in the infamous Bondi street brawl with his childhood friend and Channel 9 boss David Gyngell in May last year.

It was reported that the dispute started over Packer’s alleged relationship with supermodel Miranda Kerr soon after his separation with his estrange spouse.

Daily Mail Australia reported last year that Mr Gyngell, 48, allegedly confronted his friend outside his Sydney home and the pair began rowing about Mr Packer's treatment of his estranged spouse.

The two men had to be separated by bodyguards and were later fined $500 each by NSW Police for 'offensive behaviour'.
