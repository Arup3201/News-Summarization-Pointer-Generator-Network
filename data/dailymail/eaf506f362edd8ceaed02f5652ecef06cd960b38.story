Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet is set to escape a touchline ban despite being charged with improper conduct by the Football Association following his tantrum and spat with Steve Bruce during Tuesday’s 1-1 draw at Hull.

The Black Cats boss was sent off by referee Mike Dean for kicking over a cooler box in protest at Jack Rodwell’s booking for diving before he clashed with his opposite number.

Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face and goaded him with a comment which the Hull manager later said was ‘not very pleasant’.

Bruce was only kept from getting to Poyet by the intervention of assistant referee Stuart Burt and he was formally reminded of his responsibilities on Thursday.

Poyet, however, was charged by the FA, although Sportsmail understands it is likely he will be fined rather than hit with a touchline ban.

He refused to apologise for his behaviour following the game but will accept the charge of improper conduct, to which he must respond by 6pm on Monday.

The 1-1 draw leaves both sides still fighting for their Premier League survival this season

Hull are 15th in the table with 27 points while Sunderland are just one point behind them in 16th
