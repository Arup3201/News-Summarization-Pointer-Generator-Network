A student who tipped a homeless man head-first into a bin as he searched for food has been expelled from his university after a social media campaign to track him down.

Andrej Dalarchuk, 21, who was studying at Brest State Technical University, had spotted homeless man Paviel Labkovich looking for food in a park in the city of Brest, Belarus.

But instead of feeling sorry for him, Dalarchuck decided to push the 62-year-old in the bin.

Filmed by his friend - who has not been named by police - on his mobile phone, Dalarchuk crept up behind the older man and grabbed him by the foot, tipping him into the bin.

They then ran off laughing, leaving the old man with his legs kicking as he struggled to free himself.

He only managed to escape when some youngsters walked past and helped to pull him out.

The video was uploaded onto the internet where instead of getting more laughs, it started a campaign to identify the cruel pair who were then reported to the police.

Dalarchuk was charged with assault while his friend who videos the incident was let off.

The court fined the young man £1,600 after he apologised for the stunt and was forced to meet his victim face-to-face in court.

The fine was awarded in compensation to the older man, after the court heard about his shame at being thrown into the bin and left helpless.
