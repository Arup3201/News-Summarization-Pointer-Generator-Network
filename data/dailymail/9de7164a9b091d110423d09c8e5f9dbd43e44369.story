As the scorer of Gibraltar’s first-ever competitive goal, it was little wonder that history-maker Lee Casciaro felt like a Rock star when he left Hampden Park on Sunday night.

However, as the 33-year-old Ministry of Defence policeman would later reveal, he was not the first man from the tiny British overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the National Stadium.

If the outstanding memory of the 2002 Champions League Final for most people remains Zinedine Zidane’s exquisite volleyed goal, in Gibraltar it was the sight of local businessman Joe Beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a Real Madrid strip.

Beriro would later appear on Gibraltar’s version of Strictly Come Dancing, before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye.

His place as the most famous man in Gibraltar now passes to Casciaro after criminal defending by Scotland allowed the cop to race clear, fire low past David Marshall and utterly stun Hampden.

For the striker, all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of Zidane by scoring a goal to remember in Mount Florida.

‘It was a Gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his Madrid shirt in that Champions League Final in 2002. I remember that well,’ he beamed.

‘It was just a dream come true for me to score that goal. It’s unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for Gibraltar.

‘I don’t think I will get a hero’s reception when I get home. We still lost the game – but it is still an achievement to get the goal.

‘We have only just joined UEFA and started to train on a football pitch. All my life, we’ve been training wherever we can, running on the road, or for 90 minutes a week on a seven-a-side pitch.

‘Even two or three years ago I didn’t think I would be playing for Gibraltar because I didn’t think we would get into UEFA. Everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day.

‘This goal is something that I will cherish for the rest of my life. I knew it was going in as soon as I hit it. It was a great feeling.

‘I swapped my second shirt with Ikechi Anya but I kept my shirt from the first half. I am going to put it up in my house! But I’m hoping there are more goals to come for me in future.’

Despite ultimately losing 6-1 to Gordon Strachan’s side, Casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team.

‘I would think we have shown that we are not,’ he said. ‘We are improving and we do try to play football, which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group. We try to create a good game for the spectators to watch.’

Last June, the first-ever winning goal scored by the British overseas territory - with a 30,000-population comparable with Wishaw - was slotted home in a 1-0 friendly win over Malta in Portugal.

That night the history-maker was Kyle Casciaro, Lee’s brother, who was an unused substitute on Sunday. A third brother, Ryan, played in defence for Gibraltar at Hampden in front of proud parents Henry and Helen.

‘I’m keeping it in the family,’ smiled Lee. ‘My mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today. We have to go to Faro in Portugal to play our home games, but they have always been there for us. It is thanks to them that we are here. It is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level. I don’t think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad.’

With the benefit of having played all the Group D teams now, Casciaro feels that Scotland and Ireland – who meet in Dublin in June - will be in a battle for third place behind Poland and Germany.

‘Germany are the world champions and Poland are a very strong and physical team,’ said Casciaro, who jetted off to Paris on holiday after Sunday's game. ‘I think it is between Scotland and Ireland to finish in third spot.

‘I thought we showed a good reaction after falling behind. And I thought the Scottish fans were a bit apprehensive when we equalised.

‘But Scotland’s second and third goals killed us. We aren’t professionals and to try and maintain that sort of level was very hard for us.

‘But our manager Davie Wilson was very proud of us afterwards. And I think the whole of Gibraltar will be proud as well.’
