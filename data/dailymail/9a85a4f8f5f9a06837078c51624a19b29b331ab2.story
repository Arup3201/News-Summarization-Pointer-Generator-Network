A British ISIS fighter, who used to live at home with his mother and work as a security guard in Morrisons, appears to be living as a hopeless loner in Syria.

According to his social media page, Omar Hussain, has real difficulty completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes.

Avidly recording his mundane life through an array of pictures and essays, Hussein seems to be a lonely, bored fighter, scrounging off ISIS without ever fighting on the frontline.

Known as Abu Saeed al-Britani or Awlaki, Omar Hussain told BBC Newsnight last August: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'

Pathetic attempt: Hussain admits it took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes. One social media user said his mum could peel all of Syria's potatoes in that time.

The pampered extremist appears to have a sweet tooth, showing off his first Ferrero Rocher chocolate in years.

The bearded jihadi creepily stands behind a group of well armed young girls, indoctrinated by the radical teachings of ISIS.

The bumbling radical revealed how he battles with peeling potatoes without a peeler rather than fighting the Assad regime.

In one photo, several measly peeled potatoes are shown, with Hussain admitting it took him an astonishing 50 minutes to peel just 10 minuscule potatoes.

The failed fighter wrote: 'Life can't go on like this, I need a Sabi (servant) :(' He confessed that he had to cut up the potatoes the next morning after tiring himself out with the peeling process.

One social media user mocked Hussein, joking that his mum could peel all of Syria's potatoes in the time it took him. 

His most recently difficulty has been washing his clothes, with the jihadi revealing how he gets flustered when it begins to rain and he has to bring his washing in from the line.

A number of photos show the fighter doting on his pet cat, Lucy, who appears to be one of his only friends in Syria.

According to his social media page, Omar Hussein, has real difficulty completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes.

He has proudly shown off a few of his attempts at cooking. The 27-year-old wrote commented on one his thick sludge like inventions: 'I am, what the Oxford dictionary defines as, a Chef! Tuk (sic) me 37 mins 2 make, I'm proud of myself.'

Such a task is a serious challenge for Hussein, who appears unused to such an easy task. 

Hussein has also posted a picture of his local gym, which he appears to have once visited. He also showed off his photos of himself lazily lounging by a swimming pool in Syria.

The former supermarket security guard seems to enjoy spending much of his time lounging by a pool in Syria.

Much of his time seems to be spent feeding his pet cat called Lucy. Unaware that cats should be eating specialist cat food, the ignorant jihadi prefers to feed his poor cat ice cream.

A number of photos show the fighter doting on the cat, who appears to be one of his only friends.

He also showed off a chilling set of photos of young girls, dressed in full veils holding AK 47s. Creepily standing in the background of one group shot, the ex-supermarket worker wrote: 'This is how we teach your in kids in Sham (Syria).' 

The calamitous jihadi initially joined the Al Qaeda affilitated group Jabhat al-Nusra, before switching to the more popular ISIS after just four months.

Another photo reveals the pampered extremist has a sweet tooth with the hapless jihadi showing off a Ferrero Rocher chocolate. Coco pops appear to be 27-year-old's favourite breakfast cereal, which he used to live off when he occasionally did guard duty as a fighter last year.

Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, first came to prominence when he appeared in a ISIS propaganda video, urging the West to send troops to fight ISIS, vowing 'we'll send them back one by one in coffins.'

Last August, Hussain appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'
