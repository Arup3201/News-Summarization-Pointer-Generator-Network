Spain's Supreme Court has dismissed a second paternity suit brought against former King Juan Carlos, accepting the ex-monarch's argument that the claim had no basis.

The court said Wednesday the decision was backed by seven judges to three.

Juan Carlos, 77, lodged an appeal after the court in January agreed to consider a claim by a Belgian woman, Ingrid Sariau, that her mother had a relationship with Juan Carlos which lasted into 1966, when she was born.

In January, the court dismissed a similar claim by a Spanish man.

Juan Carlos married former Queen Sofia in 1962 and became king in 1975.

He was immune from lawsuits while king, but lost the privilege on abdicating in June in favor of his son, Felipe.

Juan Carlos was for decades held in high esteem for steering Spain from military dictatorship to democracy.

He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco.

But his reputation plummeted after he took a secret elephant hunting trip to Botswana in 2012 at the height of Spain's financial crisis, despite being honorary president of the WWF.

He later apologized for the trip.
