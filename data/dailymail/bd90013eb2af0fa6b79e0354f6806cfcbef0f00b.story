Piers Morgan today faced calls from the Culture Committee chairman to return to the UK to answer 'very serious questions' over allegations of phone hacking.

Conservative MP John Whittingdale said the CNN star and former Daily Mirror editor could be quizzed by police, as others said Morgan could 'add more light' to the phone hacking investigation.

Mr Morgan has been accused of bragging about listening to personal voicemails by Heather Mills who claimed her phone had been hacked by journalists from the paper.

Mills claimed that a senior Mirror Group journalist admitted hacking voicemails left for her by Sir Paul McCartney.

But Mr Whittingdale said Mr Morgan 
would not immediately be called in front of the Commons Culture, Media 
and Sport Committee, which is investigating phone hacking, because the 
police inquiry  'has to be the priority '.

Sir Paul McCartney's former wife told BBC2's Newsnight that the journalist made the admission in 2001.

The BBC, which declined to name the 
journalist allegedly involved, said it was not Mr Morgan, who was editor
of the Daily Mirror at the time.

Mr Morgan issued a statement describing Ms Mills' claims as  'unsubstantiated '.

Tory MP Therese Coffey, a member of 
the Culture Committee, called on Mr Morgan to help the police in the 
light of the  'very strong ' new evidence.

'I just hope that the police take the
evidence and go with it and if Mr Morgan wants to come back to the UK 
and help them with their inquiries - and I don't mean being arrested in 
any way - I'm sure he can add more light, ' she told Newsnight.

Sir Paul McCartney: Morgan wrote how the ex-Beatle had sung We Can Work It Out in his message to Miss Mills

'I think it would help everybody, 
including himself and this investigation, if he was able to say more 
about why he wrote what he did in 2006. '

Mr Whittingdale told the BBC News 
channel:  'What Therese Coffey has said is absolutely right - I would 
like to see Mr Morgan come back to this country and answer what are some
very serious questions. '

He said the committee did not have the power to compel people to return to the UK to face questions.

'Now he may return to the UK, I hope 
he will return to the UK and I imagine that there will be some questions
which will be put to him, possibly by the police on the basis of the 
evidence that has emerged, ' he said.

'But at the moment, we can't do that.
I'm sure the committee will want to talk about it when we meet but 
Parliament is in recess at the moment, the police investigation is 
ongoing.

'And the police investigation has to be the priority. '

In 2006, Morgan wrote an article, 
published in the Daily Mail, saying: 'At one stage I was played a tape 
of a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone. It was 
heartbreaking.'

'The couple had clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back.

'He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang  'We Can Work It Out ' into the answerphone.'

Tory MP Therese Coffey, left, and Labour 
deputy leader Harriet Harman, right, have called on Morgan to answer 
questions on the phone hacking scandal

Miss Mills told Newsnight: ‘There was
absolutely no honest way that Piers Morgan could have obtained that 
tape that he has so proudly bragged about unless they had gone into my 
voice messages.’

Trinity Mirror, publisher of the Mirror, said all its journalists work within the law.

And Morgan himself today took to Twitter to comment on the calls for him to return, as he tweeted: 'So heart-warming that everyone in UK's missing me so much they want me to come home #swoon'.

But after hearing Miss Mills's 
accusations, Ms Coffey called on Morgan to return to the UK to help the 
police with their inquiries in the light of the 'very strong' new 
evidence.

'I just hope that the police take the
evidence and go with it and if Mr Morgan wants to come back to the UK 
and help them with their inquiries - and I don't mean being arrested in 
any way - I'm sure he can add more light,' she told Newsnight.

'I think it would help everybody, 
including himself and this investigation, if he was able to say more 
about why he wrote what he did in 2006.'

Piers Morgan took to Twitter to make light of the calls for him to return to the UK

Labour deputy leader Ms Harman also called for Mr Morgan to return to this country to answer questions.

She said: 'It's not good enough for 
Piers Morgan just to say he's always stayed within the law. There are 
questions about what happened with Heather Mills' phone messages that he
needs to answer.

'The public rightly expects that we 
will get to the bottom of phone hacking. That's why it is so important 
that the police investigation looks at all the evidence and leaves no 
stone unturned.

'And it is why we insisted on a full 
police investigation and the judicial inquiry having the powers and 
broad remit to get to the bottom of illegal practices in our media.'

Last night Morgan said: 'I have no 
knowledge of any conversation any executive from other newspapers at 
Trinity Mirror may or may not have had with Heather Mills.'

Morgan said that in the divorce case 
between Sir Paul and Miss Mills, Mr Justice Bennett described Miss Mills
as 'a less than impressive witness' and her evidence as 'not just 
inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid'.

He added: 'And to reiterate, I have 
never hacked a phone, told anyone to hack a phone, nor to my knowledge 
published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone.'
