Tragic: Jamie Edward Capon, 16, died after binge drinking at a friend's birthday party in August last year

A 16-year-old died after a binge drinking session at a friend's birthday party caused him to suffer acute alcohol poisoning and pass out, an inquest has heard.

Jamie Edward Capon was more than five times the legal drink-drive limit when he passed away in hospital on August 3, last year.

The teenager had been celebrating with Hannah Harrison, at her home in Aberdaron, on the Llyn Peninsula in North Wales.

Jamie, from Llanaelhaearn, Gwynedd arrived at the party at around 9pm.

The inquest heard the 16-year-old passed out and was put to bed on his side, by the birthday girl's mother, who is medically trained.

Daniel Jack Ransley, giving evidence at the inquest, said the party goers ranged from 15 to 17 years old and had brought their own alcohol.

He said: 'I did see Jamie drink on the night, there was nothing unusual about the way he was acting but he was a bit drunk.

'He got taken to a bed in the conservatory by some other friends and then he passed out.

'I've seen him drink alcohol before so I just thought he'd had too much, it wasn't unusual.'

Stephen Harrison, Hannah's father, told the inquest he had been present at the party but had not provided any alcohol.

He said: 'We were in the lounge and the kids were in the marquee in the garden.

'I had come back from work around 6pm and they'd all had something to eat before heading back out to the marquee.

'I did not provide any alcohol at the 
party. I didn’t recognise a lot of people who were there as a lot of 
people were from Pwllheli, I didn’t recognise Jamie, but he didn’t 
arrive until around 9pm.

'The
 first time I noticed him was when one of his friends said he was 
sleeping in the garden, my wife, who is medically trained, set up a bed 
for him and laid him on his side.

'I
 wanted to close things down by midnight, I checked Jamie once again 
before I went to bed and my wife stayed up for around an hour and a 
half.

'The next thing my 
daughter came home and I heard a huge scream across the house, I ran 
downstairs and saw my wife and daughter giving CPR to Jamie.

'We rang the emergency services and he was taken to hospital.'

'Brilliant': Paying tribute at the time Jamie's parents said he was a 'brilliant, kind-hearted son'. A coroner ruled he died as a result of abusing alcohol

Paying tribute days after his death, the parents of Jamie Capon described the teenager as a 'brilliant, kind-hearted son'.

His mother Lesley Roberts told North Wales News, the family had donated the 16-year-old's organs to four different people, in the wake of his death.

She said: 'He lit up a room. We are glad that Jamie was able to help somebody else.'

While his father James added: 'Jamie was the apple of my eye. He was a very special person.

'I really do miss him. I don't know how we'll get on.'

At the time the family believed Jamie had suffered a brain haemorrhage. Doctors told his parents the teenager had suffered a 'massive bleed'.

He left his parents, three brothers and two sisters.

After completing his GCSEs, Jamie had planned to go on to study an arts course at college in Bangor.

Mr Harrison told the coroner that Jamie had a pulse before he was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital.

A
 blood test carried out in the ambulance showed Jamie had 414 
milligrams of alcohol per 100 milligrams of blood compared to the legal 
limit of 80 - which was more than five times the drink drive limit.

Ysbyty
 Gwynedd consultant pathologist, Dr Mark Lord said: 'He had suffered 
from acute alcohol poisoning, the direct concentration of alcohol would 
have killed him.'

North West Wales coroner, Dewi Pritchard recorded a verdict of death as a result of abuse of alcohol.

He
 said: 'Jamie must have consumed an enormous amount of alcohol, he 
passed out and was asleep. He was placed on a mattress in the house in 
the recovery position, it was the proper thing to do.

'Guests
 and Mrs Harrison realised things weren’t right and carried out CPR, 
Jamie was then taken to hospital and that was when he died.'
