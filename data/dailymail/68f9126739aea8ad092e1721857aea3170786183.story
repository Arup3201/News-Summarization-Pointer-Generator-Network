Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has branded Alex Salmond 'slippery' after the Scottish First Minister claimed an independent nation would leave English taxpayers to shoulder the £187bn exposure to the bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland.

Mr Darling reacted to the comments of Mr Salmond by saying that he was partly responsible for the bank's downfall by encouraging it to make huge errors.

Speaking about Scottish National Party leader's comments, the MP said: 'It is typical of his bluster.

Alex Salmond has been described as 'slippery' by Alistair Darling after he claimed responsibility for the bailout of RBS would be shouldered by English taxpayers

'He cannot overlook the fact that he 
publicly endorsed the deal by RBS that proved so disastrous. The 
disaster that overtook the bank was made in Edinburgh not London.'

Mr Salmond had earlier told Channel 4 News that 'the people 
responsible [for RBS] ... were the London Treasury. I'm afraid people 
will have to take responsibility for the past mistakes they made.'

But he was later embarrassed by the publication of a letter he wrote to Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of RBS, that encouraged the bank to buy ABN Ambro, the deal that wrecked its finances.

Nick Clegg said Mr Salmond was not being straight with Scottish voters by avoiding a debate on the big issues

Promising 'any assistance my office can provide', he signed off: 'Good luck with the bid.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Salmond was not being straight with Scottish voters by avoiding a debate on the impact upon jobs, Scotland's share of Britain's colossal deficit, the loss of defence employment and public spending. 

'All of these questions have been left completely unanswered by Alex Salmond for so long, and he keeps playing cat and mouse with the people of Scotland,' said Mr Clegg.

'That creates huge uncertainty, which is bad for investment, bad for jobs, bad for the people who matter the most.'

In a personal attack, he accused the media-friendly Scot of political narcissism. 'Sometimes I get the impression he thinks it's all about him. It's not, it's about the people of Scotland.'

Mr Salmond earlier promised that independence would transform Scots from 'surly lodgers' to 'friendly neighbours'.

And he also dismissed fresh attempts at the Scottish Parliament to force an early referendum on independence.

Mr Salmond insisted he will stick to his plan and put the question to a ballot in autumn 2014.

The highly-charged debate
shifted back to Edinburgh from London today following days of wrangling 
between the UK and Scottish governments.

Mr Salmond has already rejected Prime Minister David Cameron's offer to grant MSPs the temporary power to hold an earlier 'legal' referendum.

He also wants a specially-created body to oversee the referendum, which would be open to people as young as 16 north of the border.

Speaking at the Scottish parliament, he said: 'The people of Scotland spoke in the election and their voice was very clear indeed.

'A referendum orgainsed in Scotland, 
built in Scotland, for the Scottish people, discussed with civic 
Scotland and then brought to the people in 2014 for a historic decision 
on the future of this nation.'

Newly-elected Scottish Labour leader 
Johann Lamont, leading a debate on Scotland's future at Holyrood today, 
suggested Mr Salmond lacks the courage to bring forward the timing of a 
referendum.

She said: 'What's he frightened of? He can get any legislation he likes past this parliament.

'He has a mandate, he has a majority, 
surely it cannot be he does not have the courage to face the verdict of 
the Scottish people?

'He says independence will be the cure
of all Scotland's ills. The economy will be transformed by what his 
spin doctors say are job-creating powers.

'His finance minister says 
we'll be the sixth richest nation on earth. Scotland will be free and 
proud.

'He is Moses who has led his people to
the brink of the promised land but, as they view it from the mountain 
tops, says to them, 'let's camp outside for a few more years before we 
go in'.'

During the debate, the First Minister 
cast his memory back to the late 1970s, highlighting the previous 
involvement of a Westminster government in a Scottish referendum.

He referred to a controversial bar 
imposed on the first devolution referendum which meant 40% of the 
electorate had to vote "yes". The limit was not achieved, even though 
more people voted in favour.

He also warned the Labour Party not to get too close to the Conservatives.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron and Labour 
leader Ed Miliband joined forces in the House of Commons in pledging to 
fight for Scotland to remain part of the UK.

Mr Salmond said: 'Let me warn the 
Labour Party, if they go in with the Tories they'll suck you in and 
they'll spit you out as they've done to the Liberal Democrats.'

The exchanges were made as a new poll 
conducted by YouGov for the Sun newspaper put support for independence 
at 33 per cent with 53 per cent against and 14 per cent undecided.

The same level of support for Scottish independence was found among voters in England and Wales.
