To most people, free massages at the office and unlimited servings of gourmet food would help turn a workplace into a mini oasis.

But to a growing number of former Google employees, the company's well-publicized perks are not enough to keep them happy at their jobs and now they've taken to the internet to complain about the noisy massage chairs in the nap rooms and overly enthusiastic, loyal corporate following.

The confessional-type blog posts on a Quora thread
show a side of the Google machine that is not often revealed, as many 
outsiders only focus on the perks that have helped earn the internet 
company the top spot on Fortune’s list of the best companies to work for
multiple times in a row.

THE GOOGLE FIFTEEN: TOO MUCH GOOD FOOD CAUSES WORKERS TO GAIN WEIGHT

‘It sounds like a first-world problem. But their food. I put on 18 kilos while working at Google,’ one anonymous blogger who used to work out of the company's Bangalore office wrote on the Quora thread.

More play than work: Many former employees took issue with the 'immature' attitudes of their colleagues, comparing the Mountain View Google complex to a fraternity house

‘But they also provided access to great gym within the office. One of my colleagues lost 20-30 kilos while I was there. But with so much food around, it was hard to resist and soon I realized that I was eating whenever I was bored or thinking.’

Another contributor who identified himself as Ryan Lackey wrote that staffers regularly gained '5-15 pounds from the (copious, good, free) food,' but went on to characterize his complaints as 'mostly harmless'.

Some of the perks that draw people in 
can become their own issues within the office as well, as one post talks
about the drama that erupted over noisy massage chairs in a satellite 
office.

'In Zurich 
there is a quiet room where people go to relax, or take a nap. There are
very nice looking fish tanks there and you can waste as much of your 
work time there, watching the fish do fishy things,' one anonymous 
person wrote, as highlighted by Business Insider.

'There
was a 100+ emails thread about removing the massage chairs from that 
room because some people allegedly were being kept from sleeping because
the massage chairs were too noisy.'

Cramped quarters: Three to five employees are assigned to a single 'pod' where they work

OVER-HYPED JOBS FOR OVER ACHIEVERS

One frequent complaint came from high expectations that apparently did not meet the reality.

‘The constant professional boredom and 
intellectual malaise that's always saccharine sugar coated by a layer of
constant awe on the part of people you meet outside Google who want to 
know all about the perks, the culture and the interview without ever 
really asking about the work,’ a different anonymous blogger wrote.

'Google is like joining a fraternity in college, it's hard to get in because they make you jump through irrelevant hoops to do so'

‘I habitually describe my time working as an AdWords monkey as being like a janitor at the UN. You know that theoretically great world changing things are going on in the building, but all you ever really see is s***.’

A cottage industry dedicated to helping people get an interview at the company and lists off various riddles and mind games played on previous applicants. For some, the mental fun stopped there.

'The only intellectual stimulation I encountered in my time there was the interview process. Not that I met that many brilliant people, but I did meet a lot of fairly mediocre people that were convinced they were brilliant, and I saw a lot of political ass kissing,' wrote Nathan F. Yospe.

Too cool for school: Some thought that the task of getting a job at Google was more competitive than the work that they actually had to do once they had one

APPLICANTS JUMP THROUGH HOOPS 'LIKE THEY'RE JOINING A FRATERNITY'

The company's reputation helps to attract some of the brightest minds in the business, but the virtual dissenters say that those skilled workers are part of the problem.

‘I habitually describe my time working as
an AdWords monkey as being like a janitor at the UN. You know that 
theoretically great world changing things are going on in the building, 
but all you ever really see is s***'

           -an anonymous former employee

‘The worst part of working for Google is the people. In order to get in to work at Google you have to be the kind of person who "whoops" when your CEO comes in the conference room. And screams with excitement when they announce "We've introduced...searching by pictures!!!" as a new product,’ a person with the username Bradley Peel wrote.

‘You need to think it's cool to be a "Newgler". Yes, the old guard in Google like to call themselves Googlers, and when you first join you are a "New Googler" or "Newgler" as they like to call you. And they think this is cool when they tell you that.

‘Google is like joining a fraternity in college, it's hard to get in because they make you jump through irrelevant hoops to do so, this filters out the high achievers and really intelligent candidates who realize that the world is a big place and they don't have time to sit in an egg pod and do a psychometric test to get a job.’

Feeding frenzy: The company has a so-called 150 foot rule which mandates that there have to be pantries with snacks or cafeterias spread throughout the offices

Another contributor, who claims to have used his real name in the post and worked at Google for more than three years, says that pride is a sticking point that prevents an open flow of ideas.

'I think the average level of Google engineers is mediocre. With a lot of arrogance, too. Everybody believes he (males dominate) is better than his neighbor,' Vlad Patryshev wrote.

'Objective discussions are pretty rare, since everybody's territorial, and not interested in opinions of other people unless those people are Important Gods.'

All of these issues have not had enough of an impact to lessen the so-called Google mystique, as more than a million candidates apply to work at the company every year with a hiring rate of less than one per cent.
