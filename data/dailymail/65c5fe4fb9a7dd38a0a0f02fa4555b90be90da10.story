Photographs taken today of notorious prisoner Charles Bronson's court appearance are believed to be the first pictures taken of him in a decade.

Bronson, who has attacked multiple prison
 officers and inmates during his 40 years in prison, today plead guilty 
to the actual bodily harm of prison governor Alan Parkins.

He was photographed being escorted into a prison van flanked by security guards following the court hearing - at which he was sentenced to another two years in jail.

The images show him wearing prison overalls and trademark round glasses, and he is clean shaven aside from the signature handlebar moustache.

Bronson, who has changed his name by deed poll to Charles Salvador, left the governor with multiple injuries following the attack on February 28 this year.

It was believed the 61-year-old, jailed for an initial seven years but now serving a life sentence for kidnap while behind bars, was angry that prison staff had withheld mail from him.

He had held Mr Parkins, of Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in a headlock so tightly that he was unable to breathe during the incident shortly before 8am.

The notorious inmate also struck the prison chief several times over the head before a group of prison officers rushed to free the governor from his grip and Bronson was restrained.

Governor Parkins was left with a bloody nose and scrapes on his face, as well as bruising on his shoulder and arm.

Last month Bronson declared, via his supporters' appeal fund page, he had changed his surname from Bronson to Salvador.

In a rambling statement, he wrote: 'Bronson came alive in 1987. He died in 2014. Come on. The boy done well. But he's finished.

'It's now Salvador all the way to Disneyland. Your (sic) welcome to join the ride but it's non-violent all the way.

'It's a peaceful journey from here on. The creator will create masterpieces.'

The statement was signed 'Charles Salvador'.

Today he 
sat in the secure dock surrounded by six prison guards, with further 
police equipped with riot gear outside Amersham Crown Court.

Detective Sergeant James Shepherd said the police were pleased Bronson chose to plead guilty at the hearing

He added: 'Police were immediately informed following 
this incident in February and conducted a full interview.

'Bronson declined to make any comment in interviews, stating only that he would save his comments for a jury.'

Bronson has spent only four months and nine days outside prison since first being convicted in 1974.

He
 has been in solitary confinement for 36 years of that time and was 
given a life sentence after holding a prison art teacher hostage in 1999.
