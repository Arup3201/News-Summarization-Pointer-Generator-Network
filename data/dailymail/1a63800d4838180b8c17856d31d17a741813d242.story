Two more men have been arrested on terrorism charges ahead of the NATO summit in Chicago, bringing the total number of alleged conspirators to five.

It's unknown whether Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, and Mark Neiweem, 22, both of Chicago, were part of the same plot that led police to bust three out-of-state activists last last week.

Those men; Brian Church, 20, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 24, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Vincent Betterly, 24, of Oakland Park, Massachusetts; allegedly planned to use Molotov cocktails to attack President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters, Mayor Rahm Emanuel's home and several police stations.

The Chicago Tribune reports that Senakiewcz was arrested Thursday on charges of terrorism and making a false threat. Prosecutors say he had been planning with at least three other people to use Molotov cocktails in an attack at the NATO summit.

Neiweem faces charges of attempted possession of explosives, as well as terrorism and making a false threat.

Nieweem is a member of the Anarchist Black Cross and is active on anarchist message boards, WLS-TV reports.

In April, he gave a presentation called 'Why This Isn't Scary: Anarchy, Communism, Socialism and The Black Bloc' at a protect called Chicago Spring.

He is currently on probation from a 2010 arrest after he punched a Chicago police officer, who tried to question him.

The first three suspect, who were arrested Wednesday, are each being held on $1.5million bail. The trio is facing charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, possession of an explosive or incendiary device and providing material support.

During the Wednesday night raid, police seized four completed Molotov cocktails in beer bottles and weapons, including a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars and knives with brass knuckle handles, according to law-enforcement records cited by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

The suspects also had protective gear such as pre-positioned shields, assault vests and gas masks to help hide their identity during the planned attacks, prosecutors said.

Court documents indicate that authorities likely have audio recordings of the suspects discussing their plot, which allegedly included attacking other jurisdictions. The trio also talked about planned escape routes and held late-night training sessions for engaging in combat with police, prosecutors said.

‘The city doesn't know what it's in for,' an undisclosed defendant is quoted as saying in court records.

The three young men apparently came to Chicago late last month to take part in May Day protests. Six others arrested Wednesday in the raid were released Friday without being charged.

Defense attorneys alleged that the arrests were an effort to intimidate the thousands of people expected to stage protests during the meeting of world leaders.

They told a judge that undercover police were the ones who brought the Molotov cocktails.

'This is just propaganda to create a climate of fear,' defense attorney Michael Duetsch said.

Later, outside the courtroom, Duetsch said two undercover police officers or informants who called themselves 'Mo' and 'Gloves' were also arrested during the Wednesday raid, and defense attorneys said they later lost track of the two.

'We believe this is all a setup and entrapment to the highest degree,' Duetsch said.

Chicago police Lt. Kenneth Stoppa declined to elaborate on the case beyond confirming the charges against the three who were still in custody.

The suspects’ attorney, Sarah Gelsomino, said her clients are ‘absolutely in shock and have no idea where these charges are coming from.’

Activist Bill Vassilakis, who told the New York Daily News that he let the men stay in his apartment, described Betterly as an industrial electrician who had volunteered to help wire service at The Plant, a former meatpacking facility that has been turned into a food incubator.

Vassilakis described the 24-year-old as a ‘stand-up’ guy and said that the charges against him were unwarranted.

‘He and the other guys had done nothing but volunteer their time and energy,’ he said.’

Betterly appears to have a history of minor run-ins with law enforcement.

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that in February, Betterly was cited for disorderly intoxication after taking a swim in a high school swimming pool and vandalizing the cafeteria. The case, however, was later dismissed.

Chase grew up in New Hampshire and moved to Boston a few years ago before becoming active in the Occupy movement, said his aunt, Barbara Chase.

Church is an emergency medical technician and is studying to become a paramedic, according to his mother, who asked to remain anonymous. She added that her son supports the Occupy movement and traveled to Chicago in late April to join the anti-NATO protests.

One of the other six protesters who were jailed and released, activist Darrin Annussek, of Philadelphia, denied there were Molotov cocktails, or the raw materials needed to make them, in the apartment.

‘No way,’ Annussek told reporters after his release. ‘If I had seen anything that even resembled [a Molotov cocktail], I would have left.’

Annussek claimed that during 18 hours in custody, police never told him why he was arrested, read him his rights or allowed him to make a phone call. He said he remained handcuffed to a bench, even after asking to use a restroom.

‘There were guards walking by making statements into the door along the lines of `hippie,' `communist,’ `pinko,’’ he said.

According to law enforcement officials, the Wednesday raid was the culmination of a month-long investigation into a group suspected of making Molotov cocktails – homemade bombs created by filling glass bottles with gasoline, the Chicago Tribune reported.

However, the National Lawyers Guild, which is representing the three suspects, said they had beer-making equipment when the apartment they were staying at was swarmed by officers dressed in black and armed with battering rams and guns.

The men also were in a car that was stopped by police a week ago, leading to a YouTube video of the stop that has prompted protesters to complain Chicago Police were harassing the occupants, their attorney said.

The two-day NATO summit will get under way on Sunday, bringing together delegations from some 60 nations, including 50 heads of state, who will discuss the war in Afghanistan and the European missile defense plan.

On the first day of the talks, thousands of protesters are expected to march two-and-a-half miles to the McCormick Place convention center, where delegates will be meeting.

Security has been high in Chicago in anticipation of the high-profile, although the protests have been marked by relatively few arrests.

On Friday, police officers on bicycles and foot followed throngs of noisy activists through the streets of the city, but ignored taunts in an effort to avoid detaining people.

In all, police said there was a single arrest on a charge of aggravated battery of a police officer. Another man was briefly taken into custody, but was released shortly after.

Also, officers were seen trying to arrest a man who scaled a bridge tower and pulled down part of a NATO banner. Earlier, police handcuffed a man at the end of a raucous but largely peaceful rally organized by National Nurses United, one of the largest nurses’ union.

Participants of the rally demanded a ‘Robin Hood’ tax on banks' financial transactions. The event drew several thousand people and featured a performance by former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, an activist who has played at many Occupy events.

At one point, on the bridge at Michigan Avenue, the gateway to the city's famed shopping district, the Magnificent Mile, the number of officers swelled and they appeared ready to forcibly remove dozens of protesters who sat in the middle of street. Instead, police simply waited for the demonstrators to leave on their own.
