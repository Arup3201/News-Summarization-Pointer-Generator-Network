As Aly Raisman triumphantly raised her arms at the end of her gold medal-winning performance yesterday, the entire arena appeared to be cheering - except this guy.

The grouchy gentleman may argue that he had the worst seat in the house during the women's gymnastics floor exercise final, right behind Raisman's jubilant parents.

Sporting a preppy look with a white t-shirt and a green sweater over his shoulders, he cannot keep his exasperation a secret as Lynn and Rick Raisman celebrate their daughter's routine, which made her the first American woman to strike gold in the event.

Golden girl: Aly Raisman won a gold medal in the women's floor exercise final on Tuesday, her second in London

The parents' merriment as their daughter completed the floor exercise for the gold medal was so unbearable to the crabby codger that he motions with his hands for them to sit down at one point.

When that wouldn’t work, he could be seen burying his face in his hands in exasperation.

It was Raisman's second gold medal and her third overall in the 2012 Olympics. She picked up a bronze medal earlier in the day in the balance beam.

Though Raisman has made a huge splash in London, her parents are in no way getting used to it.

A hilarious video of the couple from the all-around qualification round on July 29 showed them contorting their bodies almost in sync with their daughter as she performed on the uneven bars.

Mrs Raisman, a former gymnast herself, keeps repeating ‘let’s go’ as she lurches to the side to get a better view.

Exasperated: As the Raismans clap and cheer for their daughter, the man appears to give up

Sensation: Though Raisman has made a huge splash in London, her parents are in no way getting used to it

And at the end the two both chant ‘Stick it! Stick it!’ and fist pump in the air as their daughter got a great score.

The video of the Raismans became an internet sensation - even though they claimed they were actually 
trying to be quiet so as not to distract Aly.

But their reaction was understandable as they have been 
planning Aly’s success since she was 18 months old when Mrs Raisman took her to 
‘Mommy & Me’ gym classes.

Hilarious: Aly Raisman's parents squirm and pull distressed faces as they watch their daughter's routine

Distracting: Aly's parents winced and gasped as she performed on the uneven bars

And
support is so strong for the 18-year-old her that 10 relatives have 
made the journey from their home in Needham, Massachusetts, for the 
London games.

In the 50 
second video Mr and Mrs Raisman can be seen leaning over to their right 
as Mrs Raisman mouths to herself again and again: ‘Come on Aly, let’s 
go’.

Aly scored 14.166, which lifted her to an 
overall score of 60.391, the top score by an American.

In an interview with WHDH, Mrs Raisman admitted that she burst into tears when she saw the result.

Critical: Mr and Mrs Raisman flinch and draw back in their seats

Workout: Mrs Raisman leans to her right as she mimics Aly's moves

She said: ‘I started crying…when she was in first place…There were many points that were overwhelming.

‘I
kept saying, ‘oh my gosh we’re at the Olympics, we’re at the Olympics.’
So you wanna soak it in, but it’s so nerve racking because you just 
want it for them so much. 

‘Because you know what they’ve put into it and it’s just unbelievable’.

Relief: Mr Raisman whoops proudly as his daughter's score is announced

She also admitted that she does not even talk to her daughter before she competes any more.

Mrs Raisman said: ‘We were really close to the bars and I was like, nobody say anything to her, be really quiet.'
