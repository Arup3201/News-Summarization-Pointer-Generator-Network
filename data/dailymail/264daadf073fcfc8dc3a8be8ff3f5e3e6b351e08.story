Inseparable: Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of 
Cambridge's sister, has a cup of Pimms watching the AEGON Championships
 tennis tournament

It simply wouldn’t be the quintessential British summer without Wimbledon  and a glass or two of Pimm’s.

But just in case there was any doubt, we now have Pippa Middleton to tell us so.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s party-loving sister appears to have Pimm’s on the brain this month.

The drink crops up again and again – often in gushing terms – in the ‘tips’ the socialite and part-time columnist gives on  entertaining in her latest magazine contributions.

So much so, in fact, that her readers could not be blamed for wondering whether Pimm’s might be sponsoring her very vocal penchant for the drink.

In a ‘Wimbledon diary’ column for this week’s Spectator magazine, the 29-year-old writes: ‘I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy a Pimm’s or three when I’m watching a game’, adding: ‘Only pints will do, frankly, since half the glass is ice anyway.’

She then refers readers to a recipe for making ice from her party-planning book Celebrate – which has been widely mocked for its self-evident tips such as having a bonfire on bonfire night, and storing cakes in airtight tins.

The tennis fan, who is frequently pictured in the stands enjoying the drink, goes on to inform Spectator readers: ‘Pimm’s has become so identified with the tennis “brand” that it’s a cliché – but that doesn’t stop it  from being absolutely delicious, essential drinking in fact.’

The enthusiastic message is remarkably similar in her advice to readers of US magazine Vanity Fair, to which she was recently appointed ‘contributing editor’ and offers her thoughts on ‘classic British pastimes’.

Her contribution to the latest issue begins: ‘There’s nothing better than watching the dramas unfold on the court whilst eating juicy strawberries and sipping Pimm’s  No.1 Cup.’

The socialite also reveals how she likes to ‘nod off unnoticed after one too many Pimm’s in the sun’.

Her apparent obsession with Pimm’s was first aired in Celebrate, which was published last year.

The
 book has at least three references to the drink, including: ‘For a 
Pimm’s Royale add a splash of Pimm’s to a glass and top with champagne.’

'I'd be lying if I said I didn¿t enjoy a Pimm's': The party-loving socialite, journalist and author sucks up yet more of the stuff at Wimbledon in 2011. Diageo has denied she has any commercial link to the product

Miss Middleton, who has previously been accused of cashing in on her royal connections, also writes a monthly food column for Waitrose magazine called Pippa’s Friday Night Feasts.

In the latest issue, she presents a Mexican feast, although admits she has never been to Mexico and took her inspiration from a local Mexican restaurant.

She has responded to criticism of ‘glaringly obvious’ advice in Celebrate – such as  her observation that turkeys, ‘because of their size… are perfect for feeding larger gatherings’ – by arguing she has to ‘cover the basics’.

She also laughed off as ‘all good fun’ a  parody Twitter account, @pippatips, which offers spoof advice such as: ‘Enjoy a glass of water by getting a clean glass and pouring in water from a tap or bottle. If you like cold water, add ice.’

Pimm’s manufacturer Diageo last night said it was not sponsoring Miss Middleton’s endorsements.

A spokesman said: ‘Diageo has not paid Pippa Middleton to plug Pimm’s, though we are happy she seems to like the product.’

Miss Middleton’s spokesman did not respond to requests for a comment.
