England wing Jack Nowell has made a successful return to action after being sidelined since March.

Nowell scored two tries for Exeter in a 45-7 A League victory over London Welsh on Monday night during a 34-minute comeback appearance.

The 21-year-old, who made his England debut in last season's RBS 6 Nations campaign, had been out of action due to shoulder and knee injuries.

'I really enjoyed myself out there,' Nowell told Exeter's official website.

'I really wanted to try and get back into my own game and I didn't really want to let this break affect me.

'I know the physios and the coaches have been looking after me, but I've never felt so good out on a rugby pitch.

'I've been telling the coaches for the last six weeks that I've been fit and to put me out on to the pitch so I can play.

'But they said I wouldn't be going anywhere until I was 100 per cent, and to be fair I thank them for it now. At the time I wasn't all that happy, but I've had the break I needed and I know from just being out there again how I'm feeling now, and it's great.'
