An eight-year-old girl with Down syndrome was sent home from school on Monday with duct tape wrapped so tightly around her feet that she couldn't walk.

When father Nate Searcy collected his 
daughter Shaylyn from the school bus in Indianapolis, Indiana he found duct tape 
wrapped around both her shoes and ankles. The little girl told her father: 'My feet hurt.'

With his daughter struggling to walk, 
Searcy turned to the bus driver for an explanation and was told his 
daughter had be pushed to the bus in a wheelchair because the tape on 
her feet was so tight.

Bound: The little girl, who has Down Syndrome, had to be wheeled to the school bus because her feet were restricted

Westlake Elementary is now facing an investigation by the school district and department of child services as to why the child had been bound.

Looking for answers, Nate Searcy and his wife Elizabeth drove straight to the school, where Shaylyn is a first-year student attending a program for special needs children.

‘I had to carry her off the bus, carry her to the car,’ Nate Searcy told RTV6. ‘We went back to the school and told the principal what was going on. It took her 30 minutes to get the tape off.’

Mr Searcy claims the duct tape was so tight that it was cutting off circulation to his daughter’s feet and she was left with bruises.

He said that sometimes his daughter habitually liked to take her shoes on and off.

According to the Searcys, school officials agreed that duct taping students wasn’t correct procedure but the family haven’t been told who carried out the punishment on Shaylyn.

The family admit their daughter has thrown temper tantrums at school in the past.

‘They've called me before because she won't get her shoes on or she won't stand up and walk to the bus and had fits,’ explained Elizabeth Searcy.

‘And I've talked to her on the phone with the teacher, and she's got up and she's got on that bus. I don't know why today was any different.’

School policy states that restraint may be used in an emergency situation if there's physical risk of harm to students or others.

A spokesman for Wayne Township Schools confirmed that it has notified the Indiana Department of Child Services about the incident and has started its own investigation.

The family have kept Shaylyn out of school since the incident.

The Searcys met with Child Protective Services investigators on Wednesday and are working with the director of the special needs program to move their daughter back to her previous school.

‘The teacher that did this and whoever else was involved shouldn't be working in a school, let alone a special needs program,’ said Mr Searcy.
