Five-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams swapped the tennis court for the photographer's studio as she stripped down for an Australian lingerie company.

The 33-year-old, who has won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, posed for Berlei as part of a new TV advertising campaign.

The current world No 1 was in a confident mood after last month's WTA Finals success in Singapore as she stepped in front of the cameras in an unfamiliar capacity.

Despite the somewhat intimidating prospect of stripping down, Serena told the Daily Telegraph that she felt comfortable in her own skin. 

'I'm a normal woman - I can get self-conscious. But I think that is just natural for women to feel that way,' she said. 

'I have learned to be proud of my curves and to embrace them. It's important to love who you are and realise that you're beautiful, no matter what society says.'

The brand's senior marketing manager Kellie Warwick told Daily Mail Australia that Serena was a natural on set in Miami. 

'She was without a doubt a natural behind the camera and was an absolute delight to work with,' she said, 'She is such a professional!' 

The 33-year-old American star recently won the WTA Finals in Singapore after beating Simona Halep 

'The entire Berlei team loved working with Serena on our latest sports bra campaign, The Bounce Masters. We are delighted to have one of the world's best female athletes representing Berlei Australia.'

The ad, which is due to be released in time for Serena's appearance at the Australian Open in January, is the first the 18-time grand slam champion has done for the label after first signing on as a sports bra ambassador in 2013. 

The reigning Olympic, US Open and WTA Tour champion, it seems, is proving that she can be just as successful off the court as she has been on it.
