Deputies helped a family of four on a Michigan highway early Wednesday morning, after their minivan was unwittingly hauled by a semi-truck for 16 miles.

Snowfall prevented the Menz family from seeing anything and caused their minivan to hit a semi-truck, the Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said in a release.

A trailer was being hauled by the semi-truck at the time of the accident - and the front of the minivan jammed underneath it, deputies said.

'It was snow-blinding,' Pamela Menz said in a 1:57am 911 call obtained by ABC News. 'We ran into the back of a semi-truck and he's not stopping and our car is embedded underneath of it.

'Our windshield is completely shattered. I can't see nothing.'

Menz was  returning from an airport with her husband Matt Menz behind the wheel, as the couple's children Justin and Jennifer were passengers, UpNorthLive reported.

The Roscommon County Sheriff's Office said snowfall prevented the family from telling 911 where they were, and that deputies for both Roscommon and Crawling counties went to help. 

Matt Menz told UpNorthLive of the semi-truck driver 'He apparently didn't know that we were there and before we knew it, he ended up dragging us 16 miles. 

'I was on the phone with 9-1-1 for the whole time. It's a hopeless feeling, helpless feeling. Out of control, you're just along for the ride.'

Justin Menz has autism and was launched from the backseat into his sister's seat in the minivan, the website reported.

Incident: The Menz family was on the phone with 911 for 25 minutes until deputies showed up and were able to help them 

Jennifer Menz told UpNorthLive '[I] started to console him, and take care of him, and tell him it was okay. I started to call him down. When the airbags went off, just that smell like we were going to catch on fire and I thought we were.'

The Menz family was on the phone with 911 for 25 minutes until deputies showed up and were able to help them, the news outlet reported.

In a release, the sheriff's office said 'The vehicles were later intercepted by deputies from the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office, south of Grayling on northbound I-75. 

'Deputies successfully stopped the vehicles without incident, 16 miles from where the original collision had occurred.'

Authorities took the four people to a nearby hospital, and 'no serious injuries are suspected,' the release said.

Randy Stevenson, Roscommon County Sheriff, told UpNorthLive that the only way to get the minivan out was to contact 911.
