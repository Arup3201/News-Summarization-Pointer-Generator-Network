Two border officials sacked over their alleged links to Islamist terrorists are suing the Government at the European Court of Human Rights.

Kashif Tariq was suspended by the Home Office because of his cousin’s involvement in a transatlantic bomb plot.

Bilal Gulamhussein was taken off duty because he was accused of being a ‘close associate’ of alleged insurgents fighting British troops in Iraq during the British occupation.

The pair had their security clearances revoked but Government  lawyers used controversial ‘secret courts’ rules to stop them seeing the key evidence against them.

Now they are claiming their rights to fair hearings were breached and have launched proceedings against the UK.

Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab, a former Foreign Office lawyer, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘These individuals have enjoyed a series of appeals under the British justice system.

'It is a perverse waste of UK taxpayers’ money for these cases now to join the Strasbourg merry-go-round.’

Mr Tariq, 34, worked in Ports-mouth removing illegal immigrants. He was suspended from his post on basic pay in 2006 when his brother and cousin were arrested ‘during a major counter-terrorism investigation into a suspected plot to mount a terrorist attack on transatlantic flights’.

His brother was never charged but his cousin, Tanvir Hussain, was jailed for at least 32 years in 2009 for his role in the liquid bomb plot.

There is no suggestion that Mr Tariq was involved in the terror cell.

Later
 that year he had his security clearance withdrawn due to fears that 
terrorists would try to use him to help their plans. This prevented him 
continuing in his post.

It is unclear when he stopped receiving pay. Mr Tariq sought  damages, challenging the decision to suspend him.

However, the Home Office refused to let him see all the evidence against him on the grounds of national security, and the employment tribunal agreed to hear his case in private, with Mr Tariq shut out when the secret material was being discussed.

He challenged this ruling, but in July 2011 the UK’s most senior judge ruled that the secret sessions were lawful.

Mr Gulamhussein, 46, worked as an admin assistant in the Home Office’s immigration service from 1999. In 2005 he was suspended, accused of ‘association with individuals suspected of involvement and support for terrorism overseas, in particular the insurgency in Iraq’.

He appealed but his hearing relied on evidence heard in secret. His appeal was rejected in early 2011 and the Home Office later terminated his employment.

The Strasbourg court is considering their case. Their solicitor Fraser Whitehead said they want to make secret courts fairer by giving more support to security-vetted lawyers acting for claimants. A Home Office spokesman declined to comment.
