A barefoot have-a-go-hero leapt over a deer fence and sprinted through woods to pull a woman from the wreckage of a crashed plane moments before it exploded.

Craig Schum, 33, from Brooklyn, jumped out of his Jeep after seeing the light aircraft come down after taking off from East Hampton Airport in Long Island.

Mr Schum, who has been working at a bakery in Wainscott, Long Island, saw the pilot staggering around close to the wreckage but then noticed a woman was still inside.

Without a thought for his own safety he raced over, grabbed the woman and pulled her to safety moments before the plane burst into flames. Emergency crews arrived moments later.

The single engine Mooney plane had crashed in thick woodland, about a half mile northeast of the airport after developing engine trouble.

East Hampton police said the pilot and passenger had flown into the area earlier that day and were returning to Taunton, Massachusetts.

Pilot Steven Bochter, who owns an auto
dealership in Massachusetts, was attempting to return at the airport 
after the engine began to sputter.

Witness Bill Kirrane said: 'They took a pretty hard hit, I know that. There was a lot of noise when it hit,' he said.

The plane developed engine trouble shortly after taking off from East Hampton Airport in Long Island which is frequented by celebrities and the wealthy

Describing Mr Schum's heoic rescue he added: 'He was covered in blood, and at first we thought it was his, but it was the passengers.

'That guy was a real hero.

'I went up to him after it all happened, with him covered in blood, and told him that it’s not every day that I meet someone who is willing to do something like he did.

'He did something special. It was unbelievable.'

The pilot and the woman were airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital.

The pilot's son, who did not want to be named, said they had suffered minor injuries but would be fine.

Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said the agency is investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board.

The small airport is located about 100 miles east of New York City, in a bucolic but swank area frequented by celebrities and the wealthy.

According to the airport's website, it serves a mix of private pilots, charter flights and commercial businesses. About 16,000 aircraft use the airport it annually, mostly between the months of May to October.

The airport was temporarily closed during the investigation, halting normally busy Sunday traffic off the island.

It was the second small plane crash on Long Island in a week. Two people were killed and another injured when a single-engine plane crashed into a neighborhood in Shirley, N.Y. Aug. 19 shortly after takeoff from Brookhaven Airport.
