A woman whose husband was tragically taken by cancer has given birth to his son three years after his death.

Bondi, Sydney mum Katie Elfar always wanted a big family and was determined to get her wish despite losing the love of her life, Karim.

The pair met and fell in love in 2007 and had their first child, baby Oscar, on June 30, 2009.

'The first time was a breeze,' Katie told Woman's Day. 'I got pregnant within a month and Karim was delirious when we found out we were having a boy.'

Australian mum Katie Elfar (right) whose husband, Karim, (left) was tragically taken by cancer, has given birth to his son, three years after his death.

But their bliss soon turned to devastation after Karim went to see the doctor for scans because of a sore back.

Those scans revealed he had terminal cancer.

While the couple made an immediate decision for Karim to seek treatment, that wasn't the only thing on Katie's mind.

'It sounds crazy but the minute they started talking about chemo, I was thinking about babies,' Katie said.

'I wanted more of Karim's children and I knew we needed to freeze his sperm straight away.'

Katie said the doctors were a bit taken back by the request but her husband understood that freezing his sperm would be insurance in-case treatment left him infertile.

But as the year went on Karim's health deteriorated , despite that the couple were desperate to have another child.

'He was focused on getting better so i did the IVF by myself. I was desperate to have a baby or at least  tell Karim I was pregnant before he died.' she said.

Six months after the pair wed, Karim lost his battle with cancer in November 2010. The 50 year old's cancer spread to his bone marrow and blood.

Just days after his passing Katie had some wonderful news and found out she was pregnant after was one of the frozen embryos had planted.

But more tragedy came when her second son, named Karim in his father's memory died, born 23 weeks premature.

Katie said she fell apart and cried for a month after what had happened but was forced to carry on for toddler Oscar who needed her more than ever.

It's then she decided to try and get pregnant again.

'I was worried the baby wouldn't know its father but a sibling for Oscar was more important than anything.' she told Woman's Day.

The only person Katie decided to tell about her decision to try and conceive again was he mum Deborah and it wasn't long before she was pregnant again, Karim's family also excited about the news.

Baby Beau was born on February, 7, three year's after his dad's death.

'As he was handed to me I cried. He looked so much like Karim.' she said.

Katie believes the memory of her husband lives on in her two boys. Their mannerisms, smile and laughter, a constant reminder of the man she loved, Karim.
