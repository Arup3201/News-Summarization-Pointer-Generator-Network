Corked wine is caused by a chemical that ruins the sense of smell, claim scientists.

The damp, soggy fragrance of rotten cardboard of corked wine is because of the way it masks the pleasant aromas of the drink, according to a new study.

The compound, called TCA, has long been known as being the culprit behind the bane of a wine lover’s life.

But the study is the first time the molecular mechanism of corked wine has been fully explained.

Dr Hiroko Takeuchi, of Osaka University in Japan, said experiments on insects and humans show TCA may degrade the flavour and nose of wines by ‘suppressing the sense of smell.’

A corked wine is one that has become contaminated with ‘taint’ caused by TCA (2,4,6 - trichloroanisole).

This forms when natural fungi, which resides in cork, come in contact with certain chlorides found in winery products.

If a winery uses infected corks, the wine becomes tainted and TCA can contaminate not just a single batch but an entire cellar. Once entrenched it is very difficult to eradicate.

Since the discovery in the early 1990s of the cause of cork taint most wineries have totally eliminated the use of chlorine based products.

The latest study shows the musty, unpleasant flavours and aromas characteristic of corked wine in TCA knocks out odour detection in smelling or ‘olfactory’ cells in consumers’ noses.

Dr Takeuchi and colleagues monitored the activity in the cells of newts exposed to TCA and showed rather than sparking odour perception it suppressed them - even at extremely low concentrations.

A series of experiments involving 20 human participants also showed the original odours of wines were reduced when they were contaminated by TCA - causing unpleasant flavours.

Dr Takeuchi said: ‘Throughout culinary history consumers have been disturbed by naturally generated off-flavour substances that can greatly reduce the palatability of foods and beverages.

‘Because off-flavours appear at very low concentrations of contaminants chemical identification of responsible compounds has been limited.

‘One of the most potent off-flavour compounds identified to fate is TCA - known specifically for inducing a cork taint in wines.

‘Our findings not only reveal a likely mechanism of odour loss but also reveal potential molecular architectures for the development of novel odour-masking agents.’

While unpleasant to taste cork taint is not in any way harmful to humans. It dulls the fruit in a wine, renders it lacklustre and cuts the finish.

The obviousness of the corked smell and taste depends both on the extent of the taint as well as the wine drinker’s sensitivity to it.

Sometimes it’s barely noticeable and on other occasions it knock your socks off the moment you open the bottle.
