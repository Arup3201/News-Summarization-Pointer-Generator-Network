England squeaked past the 10 men of Estonia and here, Martin Keown gives his verdict on what they did well and where it went wrong.

Jack Wilshere is praised, Danny Welbeck and Leighton Baines come in for criticism... but there is encouragement for goalscorer Wayne Rooney. 

JACK THE LAD'S ENGLAND'S MIDDLE MAN  

There was a lot of rotation in the midfield diamond, but Jack Wilshere needs to become the main man in the holding role.

Jack Wilshere drives England forward but would be better in the holding midfield role

It used to be a defensive position but players like Andrea Pirlo have made it so technical. Jack is our most technically gifted player so it makes sense for him to play there. 

On Sunday evening he was fluid in attack and was involved all over the pitch, as his touch map (right) shows. He also had more touches (66) in the opposition half than in his own (36). 

That’s fine against 10-man Estonia but there needs to be a balance. Too much rotation and the midfield becomes a carousel that better teams will exploit.

UP THE PACE TO BREAK DOWN 10 MEN 

When you are playing 10 men, you need to move the ball more quickly to work your opponents across the pitch. 

England should have tried to restrict themselves to two touches before moving it on. Estonia never looked isolated and that is more our fault than their ability.

WELBECK HAS TO BE MORE SELFISH

Sometimes Danny Welbeck is too honest for his own good. He’s such a willing runner for the team but I’d like to see him be more selfish. 

It’s difficult with two up front but most of his good work was done out wide, away from that central position where can do the damage.

Wayne Rooney misses a chance to double England's lead in added time - but he did earlier score the winner

ROONEY'S OUR LEADER - DON'T HAMMER HIM

I don’t think we should be too harsh on Wayne Rooney. He missed some good chances but he is our captain and scored an important goal. Playing abroad is always a test, especially with a young team, and Rooney is our leader.

BAINES NEEDS TO PLAY WITH MORE FREEDOM

Leighton Baines needs to take the handbrake off. For Everton he is such a creative force but in an England shirt he loses that freedom. On the opposite flank Calum Chambers may have given the ball away, but he kept going even when things went wrong. Baines needs to show more because his attacking instincts make him the player he is for Everton.
