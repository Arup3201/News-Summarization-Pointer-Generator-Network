A bootmaking workshop that made quality footwear for some of the world's most famous people has been sold for a whopping $1.71 million, but the brothers who owned the iconic store had even greater stories to tell.  

Mosche 'Morris' and Adam Perkal kept some of the biggest names in showbiz well-heeled for over three decades. The likes of rock god Mick Jagger, actor William Holden, media tycoon Kerry Packer, crooner Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jnr, the Bee Gees and even the Queen were all valued customers.

The two nonagenarian brothers worked six days a week at their workshop in Surry Hills, Sydney. Last year the Polish-born siblings who survived the holocaust died within two weeks of each other – Morris, 94, suffered a heart attack on Christmas Eve, only 12 days after he buried his younger brother, who died aged 92 – and the property passed on to their extended family.

The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger was just one superstar that bought the Perkal brothers' shoes

Saturday’s auction of the landmark property at 386 Crown St attracted a crowd of onlookers and seven registered bidders who couldn't wait to get their hands on the dilapidated three-storey property. And if walls could talk what a story it could tell. 

The brothers worked side-by-side for more than six decades. Adam survived the Nazi's Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp as a teenager before emigrating to Australia. He was joined in 1947 by his older brother - who fled the family's native Poland to Russia during the war. 

In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald in 2012, Morris said: 'In 1939, the Germans set fire to our synagogue and burnt our mother and little brother alive. We tried to escape to Russian-occupied Poland together. We arrived at the border in September and it was snowing and freezing. 

'So we turned back. On the bridge in Warsaw, I told Adam I would try [to escape] again. He said he was going to stay with Dad and our sisters.'

The next time Morris saw Adam was at Sydney airport in 1947, when he stepped off the plane after immigrating to Australia. 

'I still cry when I remember how we met each other after years of being separated and not really knowing if each other was alive,' Morris said. 

As they grew old together memories of the past became even more important but some things were just too hard to talk about. 

'He doesn't walk much any more. The [Mauthausen-Gusen] concentration camp affected him,' Morris told The Sydney Morning Herald about his brother Adam in 2012. 

'It affected everybody, seeing people killed every minute. He's been changed physically and mentally. We don't talk about the concentration camp too much, because it would upset him. He was an innocent boy, just 18 years old.' 

Frank Sinatra was another high-profile customer of the Perkal brothers

But happier times lay ahead and the brothers soon prospered in Australia. For decades they fashioned shoes and boots in a trade they believed was a dying art. They never had any disagreements and were at their happiest when working together making shoes.

They made shoes for The Beatles and took their measurements in Kings Cross at their hotel when they came to Australia in the 1960s.Their best client was Australian media mogul Packer who for 35 years paid the brothers $1250-a-pair for polo boots until his death in 2005. 

At least they knew Packer was good for the cash, although the same could not be said about the Bee Gees as Morris explained to the Oral Histories website.

'When the Bee Gees came over they didn’t have the money to pay a deposit. And Mrs Kelly was there, Mrs. Kelly was there … agent. And Mrs. Kelly said, “I’m sorry, boys, you’ll have to wait for the deposit',' said Morris.

However, on Saturday instead of shoes it was the brothers' store that was for sale. Its history meant little to potential buyers who were more attracted by the mixed zoning and highly sought after location. A reserve of $1.6 million was set for the property.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Adam Perkal’s daughter, Marilyn Hauptmann, said she felt emotional, but pleased when the building was finally sold.

'The price is what I expected, so I can’t ask for more than that,' she said. 

Ms Hauptmann congratulated the winning bidder, who wished to remain anonymous, and wished him all the best for the future.

'I'm so glad it’s going to a nice person who will take care of it,' she said.
