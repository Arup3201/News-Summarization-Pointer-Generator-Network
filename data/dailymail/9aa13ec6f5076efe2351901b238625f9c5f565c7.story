A 54-year-old NASA spacesuit from the Cold War era battle to put the first man into space is expected to fetch $12,000 when it is put up for auction next month.

The silver suit was used during the early days of NASA's Project Mercury flight programme, as the U.S. fought to beat the Soviet Union in the space race.

The Phase 2 suit is up for auction as part of the Space History sale at Bonhams, New York, on behalf of a private collector from Texas.

A small step: The silver 1960 Mercury Era Spacesuit is expected to fetch $12,000 when its is put up for auction by Bonhams New York next month

The suit, is made circa 1960, and is expected to fetch between $8,000-$12,000 (£4,800-£7,150).

The late 50s-early 60s space suits were essentially slightly modified versions of the U.S. Navy’s pressure suits.

Green nylon was coated with an aluminized powder, giving the Mercury era suits their iconic silver colouring.

It was manufactured using a special fabric made by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, now known as 3M.

‘The Mercury spacesuit epitomises the earliest days of 
space exploration, a time when our world was a smaller place,' Cassandra Hatton, Bonhams Senior Specialist in Space History said.

Up for grabs: The auction will include an Apollo 11 lunar surface checklist sheet  and a 1980s Russian Strizh spacesuit, expected to fetch up to $20,000

Spaced out: A signed Apollo 11 emblem is also included in the Space History sale at Bonhams, sold on behalf of a private collector from Texas

'A direct 
parallel can be drawn to the time when Columbus first set sail in 149,' she added.

‘No
 one knew if he would ever make it back, and one could only imagine what
 he would encounter on the voyage. It was a time of fear and wonder, and
 the Mercury era was exactly the same.

‘Astronauts
 were regarded as heroes, doing what we all wished we had the courage to
 do, and risking their lives for the greater good of mankind. This suit 
is a symbol of that courage, and an important historic relic.’

In
 addition to the iconic project Mercury suit, Bonhams will offer a 1980s
 Russian Strizh spacesuit, expected to fetch $15,000-$20,000 
(£9,000-£12,000).

Bonhams will offer these and other exceptional spacesuits as part of the Space History sale on April 8 in New York.
