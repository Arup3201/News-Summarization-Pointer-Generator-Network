The convicted killer boyfriend of a top aide to Bill de Blasio's wife has reportedly left explicit comments on a hip-hop blog touting his love for violent sex.

Rachel Noerdlinger, 43, the chief of staff to the New York Mayor's First Lady Chirlane McCray, has been in a serious relationship with ex-convict Hassaun McFarlan, 36, since 2010.

McFarlan, whose criminal past, which also includes drug-trafficking and driving offenses, was revealed last week, has now also been linked to distasteful and explicit posts on a music blog, in which he allegedly solicits women to talk about violent sex with him.

The comments, posted on the Hip Hop News 24-7 blog, ask female users whether they are 'turned on when a man plays rough with you'. the New York Post reported.

Another post complains about the sexual abilities of black women - and implies that most of them can't pay their way.

It says: 'Trying to find the right black woman with a mean [sex act] game is like trying to find a black woman with good credit.'

The words were posted in 2011 under the pseudonym 'stop end frisk'. They have since been deleted but can be seen in search engine data for old versions of the pages.

Noerdlinger has rounded on the comments - which she acknowledged as coming from her boyfriend - describing them as 'reprehensible'. 

The chief of staff joined Mayor de Blasio's team in January as an aide to McCray, and has attended high-level NYPD meetings. This has raised some eyebrows given her live-in partner's attitude to police, whom he has described as 'pigs'.

His criminal past, dredged up last week by DNAInfo, goes back to his first arrest at age 15 for shooting to death an older boy in a dispute over a goose-down jacket in Harlem.

Most recently, he got in trouble with the law last year when he nearly ran over a New Jersey state police officer while driving his girlfriend’s Mercedes-Benz, according to court records obtained by the news site.

Two of McFarlan’s five arrests on charges ranging from driving on a suspended license to drug trafficking took place while he was dating Rachel Noerdlinger.

Secret intel: Noerdlinger's critics have expressed concern that the top aide has been allowed to attend high-level NYPD meetings while dating a criminal 

The 43-year-old chief of staff got her start as a publicist representing attorney Johnnie Cochran and prominent civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton, who later hired her as a public relations adviser for his organization the National Action Network.

All the while, Noerdlinger's live-in boyfriend has been raving against police officers on social media.

In one post, which has since been removed along with McFarlan's Facebook account, he reportedly wrote: 'I cant come outside without the pigs f***ing with me in the hood.'

When asked whether the bombshell revelations could result in her dismissal, de Blasio’s spokeswoman Rebecca Katz said: 'Rachel’s not going anywhere.'

Katz, however, pointed out that 'no one at city Hall condones criminal behavior or disparagement of the NYPD, including Rachel.'

The spokeswoman went on to say that Ms Noerdlinger, a single mother of one, was 'a strong and independent woman' whose core values and believes are in line with the de Blasio administration.

Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, however, expressed concern regarding Noerdlinger's access to sensitive police information and called into question the aide's judgement.

‘It raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to City Hall,’ he told the Post. ‘She should not be in that position.’

Attorney Jeffrey Lichtman, who represents Hassaun McFarlan and Rachel Noerdlinger, hit out at her critics saying that she performs her duties as a chief of staff without any input from her boyfriend.

‘To her credit, she’s a loyal woman and a strong woman and she would not put her career ahead of people she cares about,’ said Lichtman.

When approached over the comments, McFarlan refused to respond.
