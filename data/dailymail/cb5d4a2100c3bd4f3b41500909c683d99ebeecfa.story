It is the most commonly used word in the English language.

Paul Mathis, from Melbourne, has designed the letter 'Ћ' as a replacement for 'the'.

The businessman is now lobbying Apple asking to promote his app, which features the character in its iTunes store.

In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, he said: 'The word "and" is only the fifth-most used word in English and it has its own symbol – the ampersand.

'Isn’t it time we accorded the same respect to "the"?'

As reported by The Telegraph, Mr Mathis, who has opened more than 20 restaurants and hotels across Australia, has invested AUS $38,000 (£23,500) in the new app.

But despite his optimism, it has so far been rejected by Apple.

However, by pointing out that reducing the word 'the' to just one character would be helpful for swift typing and those who use Twitter, he is hopeful he can change the technology giant's mind.

The top five most commonly used words in the English language are: the, be, to, of, and 'and’.
