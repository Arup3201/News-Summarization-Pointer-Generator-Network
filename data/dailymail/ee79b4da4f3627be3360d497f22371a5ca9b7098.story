It cost £25million, weighs 1,300 tons and was part of Iran's masterplan to double its natural gas production by the summer.

So when this vast rig plunged below the waves of the Persian Gulf in just 30 seconds, witnesses could only watch in horror.

They were, however, the lucky ones. Colleagues perched on top of the towering metal platform were forced to scramble upwards before diving into the choppy waters in a desperate bid to survive.

Some were still clinging to it as it went down though it is believed no-one suffered serious injury or died.

The accident took place in the vast South Pars gas field, located in the Persian Gulf between Iran and Qatar, last month after a crane broke during installation. It is thought that the water at the spot where the gas rig sank is over 260ft deep.

Iran has called for foreign help in raising the platform, a rare request by an industry isolated by international sanctions.

Ahmad Qalebani, managing director of the National 
Iranian Oil Company, said assessments indicated the jacket had not been seriously damaged and could be recovered.

An official with Pars Oil and Gas Company, Sepehr Sepehri, earlier told Iranian news agency Mehr that crisis groups had been set up on the site and in Tehran and that steps to recover the giant structure could begin when the weather and sea conditions improved.

However, an inside source said both the NIOC and state-run service company Sadra have reached out for international help to get it done.

'Without the help of foreign companies ... it is forecast that it won't be possible to retrieve the jacket for several months,’ an unidentified NIOC official told Mehr.

The NIOC official said that calls for help had been sent out to several international companies that might have the specialized equipment needed, without having received any response by Wednesday afternoon.

The equipment is one of four planned for phase 13 of Iran's South Pars gas field project, which covers an area of 9,700 square kilometres which is estimated to contain some 14 
trillion cubic meters of gas.

However the scheme has been hampered 
by the trade sanctions imposed on the country by the UN last year, 
leading to a withdrawal of international energy companies’ support and 
difficulties in acquiring technology.

The South Pars gas field holds eight 
per cent of total gas reserves of the world and half of the country's 
proven gas reserves as well as is the host of the most important 
industrial complexes of the country and the most important part of oil 
industry's value chain.

Tight banking restrictions, which Western governments have imposed to 
pressure Tehran to stop its disputed nuclear program, have made it 
difficult for companies to get paid for supplying goods and services to 
Iran.

The sanctions-battered energy industry has pushed on without them. Most 
of the parts are now manufactured inside Iran, Iranian industry 
officials say, but the need to develop in-house equipment has slowed 
projects.
