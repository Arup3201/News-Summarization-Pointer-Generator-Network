An Illinois-based high school's girls' basketball team has come under fire after a photo of players pointing at a Barbie doll stuck to a cross inside their Catholic hosts' school gym appeared online.

In the image, members of Woodstock High School team are pictured beaming and pointing at the doll - their symbol for 'girl power' - after attaching it to the cross at Marian Central Catholic High School.

The teenagers, dressed in white kits, were in good spirits having just trumped their rivals, Woodstock North, 57-48 inside the Landers Pavilion at Marian Central, which is the Class 3A regionals host.

However, within minutes of their photo appearing on social media on Thursday, it had sparked a backlash against them, with many deeming the image 'offensive' to their hosts' religious beliefs.

Now, the high school has issued an apology to Marian Central. Administrators have also spoken several times to the girls, whose victory last week saw them clinch their second regional title in a row.

In its apology, the school said: 'On behalf of Woodstock and the girls basketball program, we would like to apologize for our actions after the regional final girls basketball game Marian Central hosted.

'Our intent was certainly not to insult, nor denigrate, Marian Central and its family. We apologize the act could solicit a perception of disrespect to faith, one's school or the community they represent.'

It added: 'The team’s symbol of “girl power” was used in an inappropriate manner. We are sincerely regretful for our actions and will use this as a learning experience for our program.'

Officials: Woodstock High's athletic director, Glen Wilson (left), said school officials were 'disappointed' by the girls' actions. Right,  first-year coach Jen Nichols-Hogle was reportedly present when the picture was taken

'Pathetic': Within minutes of the photo appearing on social media on Thursday, it had sparked a backlash against the Woodstock High teenagers, with many deeming it 'offensive' to their hosts' religious beliefs

Shocked: One Twitter user remarked: 'If that was my daughter, she'd be restricted from playing on that team'

The girls' basketball team took the image of players pointing to the Barbie doll after winning the regional title, according to the Northwest Herald. It is not known who first posted it online.

The picture quickly made the rounds on both Facebook and Twitter. First-year coach Jen Nichols-Hogle was reportedly present when the picture was taken. However, she was not in it. 

On Friday, Woodstock High's athletic director, Glen Wilson, said school officials were 'extremely disappointed' by the girls' actions and had let Marian 'know it was not meant to be malicious'.

Official apology: Woodstock High (pictured) has now issued an apology to Marian Central. Administrators have also spoken several times to the girls, whose victory saw them clinch their second regional title in a row

'[The players] have a doll that represents "girl power". It was misused and we understand why people would perceive it in a manner not representing "girl power", Mr Wilson told the newspaper.

Marian Central AD Drew Potthoff said the two schools were working together to resolve the situation.

The Blue Streaks had defeated Marian Central 55-41 earlier in the regionals tournament. They will now advance to sectionals. They are due to tipoff against Rosary High School at 6pm on Monday.
