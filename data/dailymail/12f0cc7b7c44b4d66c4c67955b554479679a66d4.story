A bankrupt electronics retailer appears to have gotten caught up in the investor fervour for Twitter.

Shares of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. rose as high as 15 cents Friday.

That's up 1,400 per cent from Thursday's closing price of 1 cent. And trading volume skyrocketed to 14.4 million shares.

Over the past year, the daily average was about 29,000, according to FactSet.

Confusion: Shares for electronics store, Tweeter, rose 1,400 per cent because investors thought they were buying into social media company Twitter

The real Twitter: Twitter, which has its headquarters in downtown San Francisco, announced recently that it will for the first time offer shares to the public

Same same, but different: Richard Ketchum, Chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Wall Street's halted the shares on Friday afternoon after noticing the public's mistake

Bankrupt: Tweeter closed down all its stores in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's industry regulator, said the shares were halted Friday afternoon because of a misunderstanding related to the ‘possible initial public offering of an unrelated security’.

What could have gotten investors so confused?

Twitter on Thursday offered investors details about its highly anticipated IPO and proposed the stock symbol TWTR.

And Tweeter trades over the counter, under the TWTRQ symbol.

The high-end electronics chain was founded in 1972 and had been based in Canton, Massachusets.

It sold TVs, audio equipment and other electronics, but the stores disappeared years ago. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in 2007 and closed the stores in 2008.

Tweeter's over-the-counter stock was worth 5 cents before trading was halted Friday.

The San Francisco-based Twitter's stock won't be available for trading until the company actually goes public. That could be before Thanksgiving.

Twitter has about 218 million, far fewer than Facebook, which has more than 1 billion.

Revival: Tweeter's stock prices rose from 1 cent to 15 cents in one day before shares were halted in the afternoon

Flurry of excitement: Investors on Friday jumped ahead of the game and bought shares in Tweeter, thinking they were buying into Twitter, which has not been made public yet

But celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Britney Spears to President Barack Obama, are on it.

And many TV networks and news organisations encourage people to follow their Twitter pages in order to start a conversation with viewers and promote their shows. Twitter said that it expects to raise about $1 billion in its IPO.

Twitter finally laid itself bare in an 800-page filing released late Thursday as it prepares for an eagerly anticipated IPO.

The
documents reveal that Twitter is planning to raise $1 billion for its 
upcoming IPO.

Celebs 'tweeting': The likes of Oprah Winfrey are avid users on the social media site Twitter

Oprah's twitter feed: The queen of TV has over 21 million followers

Twitter fan: US President Barack Obama is very active on Twitter and uses the social media tool on a daily basis

Obama's twitter feed: The President has over 37 million followers

Popular: Pop star Britney Spears is also an avid Twitter user and boasts over 32 million followers

With its initial valuation expected to be more than $10 
billion, those with a large stake in the company are expected to get a 
huge payday when it goes public.

But
the major stakeholders identified in the documents exclude one key 
player - Twitter co-founder Biz Stone. Stone, who founded the company 
with CEO Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams, isn't listed in the documents, 
meaning he doesn't own enough stock to trigger legal disclosures.

That suggests he likely unloaded at least a portion of his stake when he left the company in 2011.

Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman

As for Dorsey and Williams, the IPO will make them billionaires.

Williams, Twitter's former CEO, owns a 12 percent stake in the company.

If Twitter turns out to be worth at least $17.60 per share in the IPO, 
Williams will be a billionaire at 41 years old. He remains on Twitter's 
board of directors.
