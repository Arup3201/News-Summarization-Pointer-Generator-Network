Ten thousand scientologists are expected to descend on Clearwater, Florida this weekend for the grand opening of a 'cathedral' which has been under construction for 15 years.

The $145million Flag Building is a massive seven-story, 377,000-square-foot complex and the tallest building in Clearwater, which is the 'spiritual headquarters' of the 59-year-old religion.

The opening of the building on Sunday will mark the first time Scientologists have had a space to receive 'Super Power' training - a program developed by the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1970s.

 The Super Power course was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and  promises to boost a person's perceptions or senses through a series of mental and physical tasks.

Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'.

These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' 

In his writings Hubbard described the course as: 'A superfantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anyone whether Dianetic clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing the super power of a thetan.

'This is the means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create the new world. It puts world clearing within reach in the future.

'It consists of 12 separate high-power rundowns which are brand-new and enter realms of the tech never before approached.'

Hubbard had originally wanted to offer the course in 1978 but many of his staff who had been through the instructor training left the church on completion of the course.

In a written statement, church spokesman Ben Shaw said: 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities.'

The group broke ground on the Mediterranean Revival-style  building in 1998, but stopped work after finishing the shell.

For three years, the group ceased construction on the project until the city started imposing $250-a-day fines for code violations.

Scientology defectors have explained that the building's slow construction is due to church leader's who have used the project as a fundraising cash cow.

An analysis by the Tampa Bay Times discovered that the church had raised $145million for the building, much higher than the $100million it was estimated to cost. 

Former Scientologist couple Rocio and
 Luis Garcia of Irvine, California contributed more than $340,000 to the
 construction of the Super Power building, before ultimately suing the 
church in federal court for dragging out the project 'as a shill'.

Church representatives have described the Garcia's suit as 'frivolous'.

While
 the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as
 a spiritual retreat for Scientologists, there will be space on the 
ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion.

The
 visitor center will have a 'grand lobby' with a three-story atrium and 
exhibits that explain the religion's belief system and practices. 

The second and third floors are home to offices and classrooms while the basement houses a huge kitchen and dining areas.

Three
 hundred small rooms for 'auditing' can be found on the buildings upper 
floors. Auditing is the religions form of counseling and a session can 
cost $1,000.

But
 the jewel in the crown of the Flag Building is on the fifth floor, 
where members can pariticapte in the Super Power program for the first 
time.

The Super Power program was developed by the religion's found L Ron Hubbard and described as one of his greatest discoveries.

'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities,' church spokesman Ben Shaw said in a statement.

Hubbard went further in his description of the program saying: 'Super Power is the answer to a sick, a dying and dead society...With it we literally revive the dead.'

As part of that therapy, members will be spun on an anit-gravity simulator blindfolded to improve their 'perceptics' - Hubbard's 57 senses which include sight, smell, taste, blood circulation, and awareness of awareness.

Another interesting feature of the building is the circular running track located on floor six.

Scientologists use the track for 'Cause Resurgence Rundown'. Basically they run until they have a moment of enlightenment called 'cognition'.
