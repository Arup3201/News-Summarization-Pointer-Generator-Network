High-resolution images taken by the Rosetta probe during a Valentine's Day flyby reveal comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in unprecedented detail.

The images reveal boulders on the comet's surface, as well as 'stunning details of the contrasting terrain,' the European Space Agency said.

The boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres, and lay scattered across the comet's surface.

To take the images, Rosetta passed within just four miles (6 km) of the surface of the comet in the first dedicated close flyby of the mission.

The sun was directly behind Rosetta as the pictures were taken, providing optimal light conditions. 

The closest approach took place at 12:41 GMT over the Imhotep region on the comet's large lobe.

Esa's Rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 March 2004 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, on a mission to visit comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

It took more than ten years to reach the comet, and on the way it flew past Mars and two asteroids.

On 6 August 2014 it entered orbit around the comet, beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible.

On 12 November 2014 Rosetta successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called Philae. This small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest.

Although Philae's landing did not go as planned, it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died, sending the probe to sleep.

The location of the lander is currently unknown. It is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but, as the comet approaches the sun, the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up.

Rosetta, meanwhile, is continuing its mission around the comet. 67P is approaching the sun and, by August this year, it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased.

This will release much more ice, vapour and other materials from the surface - and Rosetta will be there to watch it all happen. 

As well as providing the opportunity to take close-up high-resolution images of the comet surface, flybys like this also allow Rosetta's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet's atmosphere, or coma.

Rosetta is now moving out for a far view of the comet – it will reach a distance of about 160 miles (255km) from the comet centre tomorrow.

Earlier this week, Nasa said the structure of Comet 67P resembles ice cream.

In an experiment, they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard, outer crust, the interior would mostly be fluffy ice.

'A comet is like deep fried ice cream,' said Dr Murthy Gudipati of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the Journal of Physical Chemistry.

'The crust is made of crystalline ice, while the interior is colder and more porous. The organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top.'

To come to the conclusion, astronomers used an icebox-like instrument nicknamed Himalaya.

They showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up.

The composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young, hot Earth.

New results from the Rosetta mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life's ingredients; however, the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role.
