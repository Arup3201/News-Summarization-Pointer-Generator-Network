Continuing our occasional series on the hotels favoured by the rich and famous, Anne Murray takes a peek at the Abama resort in Tenerife - where Penelope Cruz tops up her tan. 

Star quality: Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Bill Clinton, Stephen Hawking

Vital statistics: A Moorish palace of excellence in Tenerife, set high on the cliffs, the terracotta walls of the Abama shore up the Canary island's most luxurious hotels.

Surrounded by extravagant tropical gardens, you'll find nearly 500 suites and rooms amid its shady courtyards.

Pristine position: The Abama resort sits in a secluded spot on the west coast of reliably sunny Tenerife

Its cliff-top setting means that you'll be whisked down to the beach by a cable car, but if you want to stay put there are nine swimming pools, including an infinity pool at the cliff's edge that looks out across to the island of La Gomera.

The Abama's unabashed luxury continues with two Michelin-starred restaurants. MB comes under the supervision of Martin Berasategui, with classic Spanish cuisine.

Kabuki serves Japanese in a sleek red and black interior.

Eight others include Le Mirador, which specialises in seafood and has views of the ocean.

During school holidays, the bankers of Europe descend en masse with their young children.

If you want to escape beautifully dressed eurotots, head to the Tagor villas. The most exclusive (and expensive) of all the Abama's rooms are reserved for over 18s only, with complimentary drinks and snacks.

Another refuge for adults is the Abama's 72-par golf course. Considered to be one of Spain's finest, it brings golf-minded celebrities including Bill Clinton to the resort.

Recharging her batteries: Penelope Cruz stayed at Abama in July with film-star husband Javier Bardem

Other sports facilities include seven tennis courts - one with seating for 600 people.

Location report: Tucked away on the west coast, near Playa de San Juan resort, which is a 15- minute walk away along the cliff.

The rest of the island requires a hire car.

Key attraction: Privacy and the sort of luxury you would normally only find in mainland Europe or the Maldives. Reliable short-haul winter sun with Ritz-Carlton finesse (Asprey products in the bathrooms).

The hotel's extensive grounds are meticulously kept, and the beach has imported sand because the local stuff was considered to be a bit dark and gritty for the hotel.

In the news: Cruz and husband Bardem were at the Abama in July.

Good enough for the rest of us? Technically, the Abama's beach is public - but access is almost impossible without going via the hotel.

Deliberately isolated, this is a resort that would prefer you to stay close, but your pockets will have to be deep - a Coca-Cola is €5.
