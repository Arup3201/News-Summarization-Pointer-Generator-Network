Tesco customers have complained that vouchers worth hundreds of pounds have disappeared from their online rewards accounts, raising the possibility that thieves hacked into the company's system.

The supermarket has asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to an online fraud.

Some customers
reported losing vouchers accumulated over a number of years after logging into their Clubcard online accounts, while others have 
been unable to log on.

Loyalty card: The Clubcard scheme allows shoppers to redeem discounts 
and other items using points generated from shopping at the supermarket. It has launched an internal probe after the suspected fraud

The supermarket said it is conducting an internal investigation into 'a small number of incidents'.

The Clubcard scheme allows shoppers to redeem discounts and other items using points generated from shopping at the supermarket.

Other loyalty card members told consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com that Tesco's customer service staff had informed them vouchers had been spent miles away from their homes.

It is understood that the number of complaints received by Tesco is significantly less than 100, while a handful of customers have already been reimbursed.

A spokeswoman for Tesco, which has around 16 million Clubcard members, said: 'We have launched a thorough investigation into a small number of incidents and referred the matter to the police.

'In the meantime, we'd like to ask any customers who believe they're affected to contact us directly so that we can make sure their accounts are up to date.'

Investigations: Tesco has asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to online fraud

The incidents have has been reported to 
the UK's national fraud and internet crime reporting centre known as 
Action Fraud, and are now awaiting allocation to a police force.

Dan Plant, MoneySavingExpert.com's web editor, said many of the site's users planned purchases - including holidays - in advance using Clubcard points.

'That makes these reports a huge worry for anyone planning ahead that way', Mr Plant said.

One user on the website, referring to themselves as 'lyou', said that vouchers accumulated over a two-year period had disappeared from their online account.

The user said that Tesco informed them that the vouchers had been used in London, despite them living 'in the north'.

Another user, called 'pawan', wrote: 'We logged on this month to find that £160 of vouchers that we were hoping to use at Christmas had been stolen (ie spent) from our clubcard account. It had been spent in two stores in London, miles away from where we live.'

The Tesco Clubcard was the first supermarket loyalty card
when it was introduced in 1995. The move prompted rival Sainsbury's to launch
its Reward card the same year.

The Clubcard, introduced to the nation through an advertising
campaign featuring actress Prunella Scales, was the idea of shopper information
company Dunnhumby.

The company, launched by husband and wife team clive Humby
and Edwina Dunn, founded their business in 1989 and Tesco bought a majority
stake in 2001.

The couple stepped down from non-executive roles on the
board last month after selling their final 10 per cent stake in 2010 for
£48million.

In November last year, the Office of Fair Trading announced
it was going to look into how Tesco and Sainsbury's target customers with
offers based on their shopping habits. The OFT said it wanted to look at whether customers were
being treated unfairly as a result of loyalty card schemes.

Customers can spend their points instore or exchange them
for more than 600 ‘rewards’. There are now 15million active users and £780million-worth of points were redeemed in 2010-11.
