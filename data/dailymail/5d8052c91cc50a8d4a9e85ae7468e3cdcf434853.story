A mountain climber was left stunned when he reached the summit of Mount Snowdon to see an incredible circular rainbow.

Sam Clack, 33, had spent four hours scaling the highest peak in Wales when he saw the stunning sight.

He looked over the ridge and saw the Brocken spectre - the name given to the rare phenomenon.

Ghostly glow: The Brocken spectre shone around hiker Sam Clack at the top of Mount Snowdon

Brocken spectres appear when the sun shines behind a person in a way that causes their shadow to be cast on the upper surfaces of clouds that appear opposite the sun.

Depth perception is affected by the mist and the resulting optical illusion means the person's shadow appears magnified.

Light diffracts in the mist surrounding them - causing the rainbow effect.

Brocken spectres get their name from the Brocken, a peak in the Harz mountain range in Germany where the phenomenon was first identified, and where it is particularly common due to the frequent fogs there - and the popularity of the region among hikers.

It can only occur when the sun is directly behind the observer's back, and when the fog behind them is thick enough and contains enough water droplets to make the effect visible.

Shadow man: Diffracted light in the mist and a low sun formed the essential conditions for the optical illusion to occur

This means they are only seen in mists at high altitude when the sun is low - although aeroplanes also often create Brocken spectres when they fly over sheets of cloud at sun-level.

In Mr Clack's case, the sun was behind him and projected his down onto the thick fog, creating the colourful, halo-like mane.

Mr Clack, a radio journalist from Manchester, said a retired physics teacher he met at the top of the mountain when he climbed it this weekend explained to him that he had caused a Brocken spectre - though only 'when he'd lifted his jaw from the floor', Mr Clack said.

'I have never seen one before and may never see another. It was definitely a privilege to have witnessed it,' he said.

Rare treat: Mr Clack was lucky to see the phenomenon, which can only occur if the conditions are exactly right
