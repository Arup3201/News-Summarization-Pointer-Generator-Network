Cradled lovingly in her mother’s arms, this is beautiful Beatrice Octavia Iris Smith, whose tragic story moved the Duchess of Cambridge to tears this week.

Born a year ago today, with a crop of flame-red hair and mischievous brown eyes, she was just 89 days old when she died from a rare heart condition, holding her inconsolable parents’ hands.

On Tuesday, her grieving mother, Leigh, spoke publicly about her family’s utter devastation at losing their beloved ‘Bea’.

At times she struggled to hold her emotions in check, apologising — not that it was needed — for her faltering voice.

Mrs Smith also talked of her hope that her tiny daughter’s battle for life would inspire others to build a £10 million hospice in Norfolk for other children suffering from life-limiting illnesses.

Her heartbreaking honesty prompted Kate — who is 18 weeks pregnant with her second child — to throw her arms around her afterwards and whisper: ‘You’re a very brave lady. I’m just so, so sorry.’

Though today she should have been celebrating Beatrice’s first birthday, Mrs Smith has written a deeply moving account of her daughter’s cruelly short life, in order to highlight the remarkable work of East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices (EACH), of which the Duchess is royal patron.

She has also given permission for the Mail to publish these remarkable photographs of the baby girl with the enchanting smile who touched so many lives.

Tragically, they were taken just hours before Beatrice, who had been born small but apparently healthy, was taken into hospital for the last time.

Mrs Smith, a 33-year-old physiotherapist, her husband, Toby, and their four-year-old son, Elliot, had spent that January day with their friend, photographer Rob Dodsworth. 

Despite being fitted with a feeding tube, brave Beatrice accepted her condition without protest — just plenty of smiles.

The family, who live near Norwich, enjoyed a remarkably idyllic afternoon at their local park, splashing in puddles and enjoying the fresh air.

But just hours later, Beatrice’s condition deteriorated. She was given emergency ventilation and, after treatment locally, was rushed to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).

Mrs Smith remembers: ‘Over the next few weeks, our immensely brave girl battled so hard, giving everything she had. The courage Bea showed for someone so young was inspirational.

‘Sadly, her mountain proved too hard to climb for someone so young, and she became frailer and weaker. As a mother, watching this was agony. 

'We knew our little girl was just too tired and could fight her battle no longer.

‘On February 24, 2014, she sadly passed away in my arms at Great Ormond Street, holding her Mummy’s and Daddy’s hands. We were, and are, devastated.’

Beatrice’s death came just weeks after the family had spent a first blissful Christmas together, entirely unaware of her condition.

‘For six weeks we enjoyed a normal life as a new family of four, enjoying Christmas with our beautiful Bea. Our amazing little girl completed us as a family,’ her mother recalls.

But in early January Beatrice became unwell, struggling to feed or breathe. 

She quickly developed cardiac failure and it was later confirmed that she had a very rare disease of the heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy.

‘We, as a family, were in shock that our little girl could have been so poorly and we had no idea,’ Mrs Smith says. ‘She was so perfect. Our joy and excitement became despair.’

It was in the days after Beatrice’s death that EACH stepped in, taking her tiny body back to its hospice at Quidenham, Norfolk, and allowing the family the chance to say their precious farewells in private.

‘As soon as we arrived we were made to feel at home,’ Mrs Smith says. ‘She arrived in a Moses basket and had her own room, with her name on the door, and was cared for with such respect and dignity by everyone.

‘As parents, we could not have asked for a better way to say goodbye in the worst of situations. She looked angelic.’

EACH was instrumental in helping to organise their baby’s funeral at a time when, Mrs Smith admits, ‘we were barely functioning’. 

Mr and Mrs Smith say the help of the hospice has been ‘invaluable in our darkest times’.

It was in the aftermath of their loss that Mrs Smith wrote to the Duchess about the support they’d received.

‘I was so touched to receive her reply, hand-signed, and obviously written from the heart. It was clear from her words that she is so passionate about children’s hospice care and EACH.’

Later, she was invited to meet the Duchess at Tuesday’s launch of a fundraising campaign to help EACH build its new facility.

It was, she says, a moment she will never forget. ‘As the Duchess was leaving, she made a detour to find me, having to weave around a table and high chair, and gave me a hug. It was lovely. She just said I “was such a brave lady”.

‘She was a bit teary-eyed, and I certainly was. I think it just proves how much she cares, and how natural she is as a person, showing such empathy and understanding as a mother.’

While Mrs Smith admits it has been a ‘difficult’ few days, she takes some comfort in how the story of Beatrice’s bravery may help to support other families in the same desperate situation.

‘As a parent, you hope that your children will make you proud,’ she says. 

‘My little girl has achieved more in her 89 days of life through the telling of her story, and what she has inspired, than I think most of us could achieve in a lifetime.’
