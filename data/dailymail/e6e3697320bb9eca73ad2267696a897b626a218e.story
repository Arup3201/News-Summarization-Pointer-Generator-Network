Victoria Beckham's triumphant autumn/winter 2015 show in New York on Sunday made it clear the mother-of-four has firmly made the transition from pop singer to fashion superstar.

The 40-year-old unveiled her latest collection of over-sized jumpers and midi skirts to rave reviews but, ever modest, she is the first to admit she doesn't actually sketch her own designs.

Saying she's had 'no formal training' in a new interview, the mother-of-four instead directs a team to create her rapturously-received clothes.

British designer Victoria Beckham unveiled her AW15 collection in New York on Sunday to critical acclaim

How things have changed! Victoria Beckham's casual and chic style of today, right, is a far cry from her super glamorous look in 2007, which the designer puts down to being 'too busy' for

Speaking to The Independent, she said: 'I have a different way of expressing myself because I haven't had that formal training.

She added: 'I've learnt a lot, in the last seven years. I've learnt a lot very, very quickly. And I continue to learn.' 

In a recent interview with the New York Times she described her design process: 'When I’m starting work on the collection, I just sit with my team and talk to them about what I like, what I find inspiring, what I’m desiring, what I want to wear, what I haven’t done before. 

'We have fit models we work with, and we’ll either work the fit model or we’ll drape on a stand. I can draw, but badly. I think that’s okay. No one’s expecting me to do it the normal way. 

'And that’s a good thing. But I do sometimes take all my clothes off and drape on myself. It’s just a bit more pleasant for everybody if we do it on models.'

But while we were once accustomed to seeing Victoria strutting down to Nobu in a tiny Herve Leger dress and Jimmy Choos, these days, Mrs Beckham champions body-covering, not body-con outfits.

Victoria's chunky knits and midi skirt ensembles that barely revealed an inch of flesh have been hailed as 'the new kind of sexy'

Victoria's family (L-R) Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz , David and Harper sat by Anna Wintour on the front row. 'This was a sexy and sophisticated take that put shape at its centre for soft and womanly silhouettes,' wrote Vogue's Jessica Bumpus.

As her family supported her from the FROW, Victoria Beckham debuted her latest collection at New York Fashion Week. The stylish mother of four chose to wear an all-black look from her eponymous line consisting of a boxy mock neck sweater, button-front skirt, and pointed heels.

Ever so chic (she goes by Posh Spice after all), the Fall line was a reflection of the designer's personal style. Sumptuous knits, cut out dresses, and cocoon coats filled the runway and what's not to love about that?

Victoria's custom ensemble is not available to the general public, but you can buy a similar sweater now at Net-a-Porter (click right).

The designer has also ditched the vertiginous heels that have always been her trademark.

She told The Independent: 'I'm busier now - so I couldn't totter around in a tight dress and a pair of heels. I think I feel a little more relaxed.' 

Mrs Beckham, admits that she was too afraid to dress down in the past. She explained: 'I suppose if I'm being honest, I would have been scared, right at the beginning, to wear lots of layers and to wear a flat shoe. Now I'm not.'

She now favours a muted colour palette of mostly blacks, greys and sometimes white, as well as flats, and she almost exclusively wears her own designs. 

Mrs Beckham has made the transition to globally respected fashion designer, silencing her critics  by launching a hugely successful brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike.

She unveiled her AW15 collection at New York Fashion Week on Sunday to a stellar front row, including husband David and their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three, sitting alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and stylist Rachel Zoe. 

Shunning the trend for overexposure, currently championed by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus and Miranda Kerr, Victoria's range was a much more modest affair.

Her designs were full of cream midi skirts, voluminous knits and calf-scraping culottes - proving that more really is more.

The entire collection went down a storm with Vogue's most esteemed fashion editors.

Last year,  the fashion bible hinted that Victoria's collection was reminiscent of the stuff they had seen on the Celine runway  before and commented that they'd like to see a 'bit more of her' in her designs.

It seems she took note. With a new direction, 40-year-old Victoria's stand-out designs, which are clearly based on her own wardrobe, winning her plaudits.

Legendary Vogue International Editor, Suzy Menkes OBE, added: 'Bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story: Victoria Beckham has made it as a designer.

'I can’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style.'

The doyenne of style journalism also added: 'Whatever fashion people say about “Team VB” doing all the work, I believe that the foundation and flow of this collection could have come only from her.'

In her show notes, Mrs Beckham explained 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.' 

The creative process for this collection was an altogether different style. Mrs Beckham explains how she decided to start with her classic designs and re-imagine them for a new season.

'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote.

'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process.

'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges...

'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.'

Commenting on her range, The Telegraph's Ellie Pithers wrote: 'Equally successful were the mannish double-breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - VB's answer to the "modern day red carpet" conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater.

'Sure, it's not a problem that vexes most of us, but she's got all her bases covered.'

Fashion website WWD described the collection as 'a study in calm sexiness' and insisted plenty of women will be climbing over each other to wear it come autumn.  

This is the latest in a string of stylish hits for the star, who last year opened the doors to her flagship store on Dover Street. 

Then, she beat fashion powerhouse Alexander McQueen, a label loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, as well as her friend Stella McCartney for the prestigious title of Best Brand at the British Fashion Awards 2014.
