A new 'mind bending' designer drug has killed 13 and poisoned almost 300 people in Russia, and officials warn it may cause lasting brain damage.

The particular strain of drug is not known to the authorities and not yet illegal under Russian law, local media reports.

The effects of the 'legal high' can be seen in a video filmed in the Siberian city of Surgut, where seven people have died and 187 have been poisoned in the past week.

Shocking effects: A video has emerged showing the effects of a new 'legal high' which has killed 13 people in Russia

An horrific outbreak in and around the Siberian city of Surgut led to local TV highlighting three new graves of men aged around 30 at the local cemetery.

A video shows a man affected by the synthetic drug in Surgut as he is being helped by emergency staff.

As he stands by a blue car, the man repeatedly gets on the ground, struggles to speak and controlling his body movements.

‘The impact is terrifying. One young man covered in blood, clutching a knife, threatened to throw himself from a window, before being talked down by neighbours,’ writes The Siberian Times.

‘Others crash cars, violently attack neighbours, or suffer seizures in which their hearts and brains stop functioning.

‘At the last count there are 12 addicts in the intensive care unit of Surgut District Hospital, and another 13 suffering acute psychosis in Surgut Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic.’

Senior local health official Nadezhda Volchanina said: ‘I don't think they will recover fully. The use of psychoactive substances destroys brain cells and may cause serious disability and loss of memory.’

Suppliers are constantly creating new and deadly smoking blends - sold as synthetic marijuana or ‘Spice’ - which bypass each attempt to update prohibited substances.

Police have made a dozen arrests in Surgut and the northern Russian city of Kirov which was also targeted by ruthless drugs dealers selling the ‘poison’ via the internet.

In Kirov, 35 of those poisoned were minors,  five of those arrested allegedly hail from Ukraine.

Today the authorities warned that the poisoning had spread beyond Surgut in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District.

A medical professional said abusers crash cars, violently attack neighbours, or suffer seizures in which their hearts and brains stop functioning.

Andrei Novikov, a senior doctor in Surgut, said: ‘As a rule, they are brought in unconscious or seriously agitated. They can thrash about the ambulance or hospital emergency room. They feel that they are being persecuted.'

Symptoms include fear, anxiety, enlarged pupils, unsteadiness, and hallucinations. Some victims fell into a coma.

Victims bought the drugs for £24 a hit, with suppliers leaving it in locations in hiding places in stairwells of blocks of flats.

Police showed images of the drugs parcelled in a yellow and green covering and hidden in plastic milk bottles.

Inga Snatkina, spokeswoman for the regional prosecutor in Siberia, said: ‘The dead people bought the 'designer drug' in Surgut via an internet shop.’

The chemical substance of the cases in Surgut and Kirov is seen as linked.

The country's Federal Drug Control Agency warned ‘this substance is an absolutely new designer drug made from two components’.
