Poachers have killed 86 elephants in one week in a single central African country in the worst mass slaughter of the animals this year, officials said yesterday.

Armed gangs in Chad reportedly killed the elephants, including 33 pregnant females, before hacking out and stealing their tusks.

Wildlife officials said the killings took place last week near Chad’s border with Cameroon.

Céline Sissler-Bienvenu, of the 
International Fund for Animal Welfare, said the slaughter ‘is evidence 
of the callous brutality demanded to feed the appetite of the ivory 
trade’.

She added: ‘Elephants in central Africa continue to be under siege from unscrupulous poachers.’

IFAW said it believed the killings 
were not reported for several days amid a dispute between local people 
and the government about the presence of wild elephants in the area.

Last year's killing spree: Armed gangs rode on horseback from Chad and Sudan to Cameroon's Bouba Ndjida National Park before shooting the animals, around half of the huge park's population

High demand: Mass poaching incidents were particularly common during the region's dry season when heavily-armed groups of poachers used military-issue automatic and semi-automatic weapons to launch coordinated attacks on herds

The organisation’s Jason Bell said the incident showed some regions of Africa faced losing their entire elephant population.

He added: ‘The poaching of elephants 
for their ivory is an issue of global significance, and needs a global 
response if we are to turn the killing fields of central Africa into 
safe havens for elephants.

Illegal trade: Selling and exporting ivory is banned in an attempt to protect elephants but remains in high demand especially in China and Japan

‘This cannot happen in a vacuum. 
Ivory-consuming nations – notably China – have to make a concerted 
effort to reduce the demand for  ivory in their own back yards.

Otherwise, the battle to save elephants will be lost.’

Last week’s slaughter in Chad comes a year after poachers killed around 630 elephants in neighbouring Cameroon.

Armed gangs rode on horseback from 
Chad and Sudan to the country’s Bouba Ndjida National Park before 
shooting the animals – around half of the reserve’s population.

IFAW said incidents of mass slaughter 
were common during the region’s dry season, when heavily armed groups of
poachers used military-issue automatic and semi-automatic weapons to 
launch co-ordinated attacks on herds.

Exporting and selling ivory are banned
under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, in 
an attempt to protect elephants from slaughter.

But demand for tusks remains high in 
some parts of the world, including China and Japan, where they are used 
for carvings and ornaments.

The demand has made the trade 
lucrative for criminal gangs, which target elephants in Africa and Asia 
before smuggling the ivory on to the international black market.

The United Nations reported last week 
that around 17,000 elephants had been poached worldwide during 2011.

It 
also said the global illegal trade in ivory had more than doubled since 
2007.

It is thought they were targeted by criminals who shot groups en masse

There is still a high demand for ivory despite an international ban
