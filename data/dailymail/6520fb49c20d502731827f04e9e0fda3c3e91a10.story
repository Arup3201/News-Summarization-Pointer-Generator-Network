Downing Street spin doctors were accused of trying to hide the sun-kissed backdrop to the G20 summit last night.

Broadcasters claimed they had been forced to conduct interviews with David Cameron in front of a giant billboard obscuring the palm-fringed beach outside the window.

The row came amid concern among the Prime Minister’s aides that the plush venue chosen for the G20, by the Mexican hosts, sits awkwardly with the austerity message emerging from the meeting.

Mr Cameron’s advisers are also sensitive to recent claims about his fondness for ‘chillaxing’

The Prime Minister recorded a series of clips with UK broadcasters at Las Ventanas Al Paraiso, in Los Cabos, a luxury beach resort situated between San Jose Del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas.

It was where the B20 - a business offshoot of the G20 - was meeting.

BBC political editor Nick Robinson posted a picture of the view from the room on Twitter, writing: ‘What spin doctors do. This is the view from the room where the PM will do TV clips - not what you’ll see.’

A Downing Street source said: ‘He recorded the clip in a room provided by the B20. It’s not surprising that we want a B20 backdrop in a room provided by them.’

The PM had earlier this year been embarrassed by claims in a new biography that he spends a significant amount of time 'chillaxing' (a slang term merging the words chilling and relaxing) rather than grappling with the global economic turmoil.

The biography painted a picture in which Mr Cameron devoted time on weekends at Chequers to singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch.

One ally told the book’s authors: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for “chillaxing”, the Prime Minister would win it.’

A Downing Street adviser even claimed that Mr Cameron ‘spends a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja’, a computer game which requires players to slash fast-moving fruit in half with a cartoon sword.

Extracts from the book were publicised before a crucial G8 summit of the leaders of the world's most powerful nations where the PM was later to be pictured taking time off trying to find a solution to the deepening Euro crisis to watch Chelsea take on Bayern Munich in the Champion League final.

Friends of Mr Cameron had also told how he enjoyed drinking ‘three or four glasses of wine’ over lunch at the weekend.

The Prime Minister has previously been 
branded 'DVD Dave' for his love of watching Danish dramas in bed with 
his wife Samantha. He also finds time for a weekly date night.

Earlier this month it emerged during one break from governmental duties, he had mistakenly left his eight-year-old daughter in a pub by 
herself when he drove off without her.

The Prime Minister – who had been 
enjoying Sunday drinks with his family near Chequers – only realised his
eldest daughter was missing when he arrived back at his official 
country residence.

The Camerons had been drinking at the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, with their three children and two other families.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said he was ‘distraught’ when he realised what had happened.They later confirmed that Mrs Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy.

‘Thankfully when they phoned the pub
she was there safe and well,’ the spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister 
went down straight away to get her.’
