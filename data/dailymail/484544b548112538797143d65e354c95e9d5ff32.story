This smart dog's certainly got the right idea when it comes to keeping warm on a chilly winter's day.

Michael Bukay, a filmmaker from Point Richmond, California, captured a clever gray Weimaraner relocating his pet bed to a warmer area of the house.

Video footage shows the cunning hound dragging his sleeping mat by the mouth to a spot beside the fireplace.

Getting comfortable: After he hauls it to the right position, he spins around and lays down

Bukay selected a children's lullaby for the soundtrack.

 

To date the clip has been watched more than 15,000 times. 

Many commenters have said their four-legged friends get up to similar antics when the cold creeps in.

'My Weimaraner steals my space in front of the space heater any time I stand up. They are smart dogs,' one woman wrote.
