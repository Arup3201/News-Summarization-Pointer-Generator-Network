A Hungarian architecture software company unveiled the world’s first bronze statue of Apple Inc co-founder Steve Jobs on Wednesday.

The bronze, life-size statue is on display in Budapest in Graphisoft's company headquarters.

Graphisoft claims to have a relationship with the Apple founder which stretches back to the Eighties - when the company languished behind the Iron Curtain.

The new Bronze Steve Jobs statue - the world's first - was unveiled in Budapest by a Hungarian firm who said Jobs helped them with 'cash and computers' in the Eighties

Jobs reportedly encountered Graphisoft at the CeBIT technology fair in Germany in 1984.

Apple helped the company to market and distribute its architectural design software.

'Apple's support included cash and computers at a time when Graphisoft was a small company with limited resources, working within the economic and political confines of what was, at the time, communist Hungary,' founder Gabor Bojar, who commissioned the statue, told technology news site The Register. 

Graphisoft is now a global leader in architectural software.

The statue dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs was ordered by the founder and head of software-maker Graphisoft Gabor Bojar. Graphisoft is now one of the world's leading architecture software companies

The bronze work by sculptor Erno Toth stands in the Budapest campus of architectural software maker Graphisoft.   

'He was one of the greatest (personalities) in our era, that’s what we wanted to express with this sculpture here,' said Graphisoft chairman Gabor Bojar .   

Bojar said Jobs gave cash and computers to Graphisoft, helping it to become a global leader in architecture software from humble roots as a tiny firm in the 1980s in then-communist Hungary.   

'In some ways, Apple was a religion,' Bojar said at the unveiling ceremony, comparing the experts from Cupertino-based Apple who helped educate Graphisoft’s engineers to evangelists.

Steve Jobs represented a technological revolution which can be compared only to the discovery of writing, Bojar said.   

'We have felt his spirit every day and now it is embodied,' he said.b 'We hope that we can deserve with our entrepreneurial culture in Hungary what this sculpture expresses as a message.'
