The world's leading space agency is looking for asteroid hunters to help save the planet - and you could help.

Nasa is offering up to $35,000 (£21,000) over the next six months to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life-threatening asteroids.

By mining talent from the general public, the space agency hopes to spot dangerous space rocks such as the one that saw off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago.

The bounty is part of its Asteroid Data Hunter contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground-based telescopes.

Over the past two decades, Nasa has been looking for dangerous near-Earth asteroids larger than 1km in size, and claims to have found 98 per cent of them.

But existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun, according to asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources, who is partnering with Nasa on the project.

In a session at the SXSW conference in Texas, Nasa scientist Jason Kessler said: ‘The likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed, although we’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat.’

Scientists have warned of a possible asteroid collision with the Earth this month.

An asteroid around two-thirds of a mile wide (1.2km) could hit the Earth on March 21 and has been classified as 'an event meriting careful monitoring" by astronomers.

But they say the probability of the asteroid hitting Earth is just 1 in 909,000 and the risk of impact is likely to decrease as they collect more information.

The newly-discovered asteroid, known as 2003 QQ47, has a mass of around 2,600 million tons (2,600 billion kg).

Its orbit calculations are currently based on just 51 observations during a seven-day period.

Dr Alan Fitzsimmons of Queen's University, Belfast, one of the expert team advising the UK NEO (Near Earth Objects) Information Centre, based in Leicester, said: 'The NEO will be observable from Earth for the next two months, and astronomers will continue to track it over this period.'

‘If a 30-metre asteroid were to hit in the wrong place at the wrong time, it could wipe out an entire city,'

Currently there are only around 100 people who tracks asteroids each day to determine their shape and speed.

Nasa wants to increase that number, particularly over  Africa and Asia where spottings aren’t being made.

‘Ultimately our goal is to get an infrared telescope that’s away from the Earth,’ he Professor Kessler. ‘We recognise we need to get away from the Earth so that our field of view opens up.’

‘The opportunity as the number of detections increases is for amateur astronomers – our citizen scientists – to help here.’

Citizens science projects such as this are increasingly being used by researchers to help in large-scale projects.

Zooniverse, for example, is one of the leading online platforms for citizen scientists, working on a range of projects including classifying galaxies.

Last month, up one million volunteers signed up to the programme.
