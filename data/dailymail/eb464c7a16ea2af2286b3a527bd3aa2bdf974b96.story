The transgender 'fake doctor' at the centre of the 'toxic tush' botched cosmetic surgery cases in Florida has pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought against her.

Thirty-two-year-old Oneal Morris denied three counts of practicing medicine without a license in a written plea to a Broward, Florida judge.

Prosecutors say that Morris injected a substance consisting of cement, Fix-A-Flat, mineral oil and superglue into her two of her 'patients' in a Dania Beach motel room in 2009.

Born a man but living as a woman, Morris is accused of charging hundreds of dollars to administer the potentially lethal shots, which several of her male and female customers allege left them with life-threatening injuries.

Coming to national attention after her arresting mugshots showed her with an disproportionately outsized backside, Morris allegedly performed similar procedures on three other women in two Florida counties.

The latest charges relate to Lournise Linton, 41, of Tampa, Pheilia Parker, 36, of Vero Beach and Tiffany Kennedy of Lauderhill.

Miss Linton and Miss Parker say that they traveled to meet Morris in a Motel Six in Dania Beach in May of 2009.

The pair claim that Morris presented herself as a bone-fide medical professional and was wearing a nurses uniform and was carrying a photo ID.

However, both women claim the equipment he used to produce the desired 'junk in the trunk' backside implants was not of medical grade and that they almost died as a result of the injections.

One of the ladies says she was pumped full of a substance that Morris was carrying in a Pedialyte oral re-hydration bottle.

The other lady claims that Morris could not remove the cotton ball from the injection site because it was stuck down by superglue.

Both women say they paid upwards of $4000 for the procedures.

It is alleged that Oneal Morris would pose as a medical professional complete with standard issue I.D

The other lady, Tiffany Kennedy paid $1000 in 2009 for the work that she says Morris carried out and in fact came to Miss Kennedy's home to carry out the procedure.

All three women told investigators on the case that Morris looked and spoke like a medical professional.

In an interview with Florida's Sun Sentinel this week, Miss Kennedy's mother, Julie Matthews said that her daughter was always concerned for her looks.

'She always thought that she had to have a bigger rear end,' the mother said Miss Matthews.

'She's perfect the way she is. She's very beautiful.'

It was after the procedure that her daughter became ill suffering from a fever and according to doctors came close to death.

Miss Matthews said that her daughter came forward to authorities after seeing Morris on television following last years infamous arrest.

All three women still suffer from serious lingering side effects.

However, Morris' attorney Michael Mirer said his client is ready to face down all the charges brought against her.

'My client is looking forward to her day in court," said Mr Mirer.

'At this point, I haven't seen any evidence other than what the victims are saying.

'These allegations are from three years ago. I question the timing of charges being brought now.'

Also known by her alias the 'Duchess' Oneal Morris was arrested in November of last year along with her alleged assistant Corey Alexander Eubanks.

She was accused in Miami-Dade of tricking a Miami Gardens woman into paying for a round of six injections of life threatening chemicals given through a tube hooked to a cooling fridge.

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight last year, Morris protested her innocence before this latest round of charges.

'They didn’t catch me doing anything. So they are just allegations. So I’m innocent. I really am innocent or whatever,' said Morris.

'I didn’t do any of these things to these people. Just know these people who are lying are ruining my life. That’s all I have to say.'
