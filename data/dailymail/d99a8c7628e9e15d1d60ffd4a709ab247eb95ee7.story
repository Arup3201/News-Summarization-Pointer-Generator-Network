Barratts Shoes has gone into administration for the third time in four years, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk.

Directors at the Bradford-based chain were left with no choice after an investor pulled out of a plan to inject £5 million at the end of last week as the company sought to shore up its finances, according to a statement.

It comes four years after the company went bust in 2009 when parent company Stylo threw in the towel forcing 220 of 380 stores to be shut.

Just two years later, the company called in the administrators again, only to secure an 11th-hour rescue deal in January 2011.

No bailout: Directors at the Bradford-based chain were left with no choice after an investor pulled out of a plan to inject £5 million at the end of last week as the company sought to shore up its finance

This time round, Philip Duffy and 
David Whitehouse of financial advisory and investment banking firm Duff 
& Phelps were appointed administrators on Friday afternoon.

The administrators said they were reviewing the company's financial position and seeking a sale of the business as a going concern but said: 'At this stage redundancies and/or store closures cannot be ruled out.'

Amid the many shoe factories of Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company.

W Barratt & Co invited customers to 'Walk the Barratt Way' in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal.

The company's Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold 'the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt's Factory Price'.

In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory.

The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand.

In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts.

Barratts
Shoes operates from 75 stores and 23 concessions across the UK and 
Ireland, employing 1,035 people, of whom 521 are part time, the 
statement said.

Staff have been informed and stores 
are trading as usual but further announcements on the future of the 
chain's outlets are expected in the next few days.

Recent reports suggested that Barratts owner and boss Michael Ziff was seeking cash to pay for stock without which it would be running perilously low during the crucial run-up to Christmas.

Mr Duffy said: 'Difficult trading conditions in the sector led the directors to explore potential refinancing options and additional equity for the business.

'The company had recently received an offer from an investor to inject £5 million into the company but that offer was withdrawn on the evening of November 7.

'In view of the financial position of the company and withdrawal of that equity offer, the directors were left with no choice but to appoint administrators.'

The first time the business was put into 
administration saw Mr Ziff, chairman of Barratts 
Priceless parent company Stylo, buy 160 shops from Deloitte after the
chains were put into administration at the height of the recession in 2009. At the time, Deloitte closed 220 stores but Mr Ziff was able to safeguard around 3,000 jobs.

Then, in December 2011, Barratts watched its concessions business collapse with a loss of 1,600 jobs.

The firm again, however, found a buyer to rescue 89 of its standalone stores, protecting 
1,184 jobs. Nevertheless, that deal came at a cost of 191 stores and 371 concessions.

Darina Kerr, partner at law firm Dundas & Wilson, said today's announcement was another example of 2011’s crop of high street casualties declining from 'walking wounded to fatally injured.'

'Barratts’ descent into administration also underlines the fact that debt arrangements alone are not a long-term solution,' she said. 'Although debt arrangements can, in some cases, be agreed to stave off total collapse, if the fundamentals of a business are not reformed to withstand rapidly-changing market trends, high street retailers will continue to risk entering insolvency after insolvency. 

'Best brogues at factory price': In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works in Northampton. Here it is in action in 1931

'Good footwear': By the 1920s the company was flourishing as, as this 1924 advertisement suggests

'Given that a substantial 
restructuring took place in the wake of the company’s last brush with 
administrators in 2011, the terms of a new financing arrangement may 
prove to be extremely onerous considering the already strict conditions 
for Barratts' last rescue package two years ago.'

Britain’s
battered High Street chains have been struggling in recent months as 
austerity cuts continue to bite into household budgets.

The challenging consumer environment is having a mixed effect on Britain’s retailers.

The wealthy continue to splash out in upmarket stores such as Mulberry and Burberry, while hard-up consumers dodge mainstream chains.

Last month Blockbuster's chain of film and computer game rental shops in Britain was set to go into administration for the second time in 10 months after its private equity owner failed to turn the business around.

Earlier today budget airline, Flybe 
announced plans to axe another 500 jobs its latest round of cost-cutting
after reporting passenger numbers grew by 5.6 per cent to 4.3 million, 
while it returned to profit with a surplus of £13.8million.
