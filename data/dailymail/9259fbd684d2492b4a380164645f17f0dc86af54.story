Relaxed: Hate preacher Anjem Choudary is spotted out shopping in East London

Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been spotted out spending his £25,000 a year benefits buying yoghurts and crisps.

Dressed in a white tunic and black shoes, the cleric stepped out onto the streets of East London for the first time since his vile rant about the death of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Choudary, 46, has been warned by the Met he is 'constantly' under surveillance to see if his comments are breaking the law.

His bag of shopping included a toffee-flavoured Müller yoghurt and Walkers' Sensations crisps.

On Tuesday a video emerged of Choudary declaring that murdered soldier Lee Rigby should 'burn in hellfire' and that his killers should be considered martyrs.

The extremist maintains that despite 
being executed in barbaric circumstances the 25-year-old father of one 
deserves no sympathy because he was a 'non-Muslim' and called suspect Michael Adebolajo
a 'nice man'.

He has persistently refused to condemn 
the murder in Woolwich almost a fortnight ago and blames 'war monger' 
David Cameron for radicalising young British Muslims to the extent they 
carry out acts of terror.

A video uncovered by The Sun, shows the preacher, who claims £25,000 a year in benefits, saying that the people who murdered Drummer Rigby will go to 'Paradise'.

Message: The Hate Preacher said that suspect 
Michael Adebolajo (left) was a 'nice man'. Adebolajo and Michael 
Adebowale (right) have been charged with Lee Rigby's murder

Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims

Two men have been charged with the murder and Choudary knew at least one of them, and called one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, a 'nice man'.

Filmed in an office near his mosque in north-east London, he would not denounce the soldier's death.

'So as an adult non-Muslim, whether he is part of the Army or not part of the Army, if he dies in a state of disbelief then he is going to go to the hellfire. That’s what I believe so I’m not going to feel sorry for non-Muslims.'

Choudary went on that the British Government is to blame for Drummer Rigby's death, which is a 'drop in the ocean'.

'I think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths, which is really the British government.

'You need to take into account the hundreds of thousands of incidents of people slaughtered, of weddings bombed, of Muslims tortured, of innocent people kept in prison for over ten years.'

He also attacked the charity Help for Heroes, which helps care for injured British soldiers, saying they cannot be heroes because they 'shoot children in Afghanistan'.

Later extremist Choudary insisted he had not 'said anything incendiary' and claims he does not fear being arrested.
