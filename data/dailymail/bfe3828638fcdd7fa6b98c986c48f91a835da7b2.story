They may all be from different walks 
of the showbiz circuit but Kimberley Walsh, Martine McCutcheon and Gemma Atkinson all have something in common: their flawless glowing skin.

And the A-list trio have another thing in common, they each achieve it with the same secret ingredient: rice powder.

Martine, Kimberley and Gemma all use a bargain face scrub using the curious ingredient.

Famous fans: Kimberley Walsh, Gemma Atkinson and Martine McCutcheon all share the same beauty secret: rice powder

Rice powder has been used for 
hundreds of years and Japanese geishas in the sixteenth century used 
rice powder to give a porcelain appearance to their skin.

And modern day scientists back up the theory too. They
 have discovered that rice powder has a chemical structure similar to 
ceramide, a substance found on human skin that aids in the production of
 collagen.

Rice powder: Simple's smoothing facial scrub contains the powerful cleansing ingredient, as does Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and T. LeClerc. Banane Powder

The Kind To Skin Smoothing Facial Scrub by Simple which the women all swear by uses the powder as a key ingredient, and is a rather purse-friendly £3.99 from your local Boots.

Speaking about the product, Caroline Frazer, Skincare Expert for Simple who has worked with the likes of Lily Donaldson and Agyness Deyn, said: 'Rice
 powder is a great ingredient as its a gentle skin loving exfoliator 
that helps scuff away dead skin cells from the surface of the skin.

'This scrub is crammed full of rice 
granules, pro-vitamin B5 and vitamin E and is perfect for any sensitive 
souls out there who want a smoother, brighter and more even textured 
complexion without irritations.

'It’s also great for prepping those 
Valentine’s Day pouts! Simply dot a small amount onto a damp cotton wool
 ball and carefully massage over the lip area to whisk away any dry 
flaky skin. Finish with a smear of nourishing lip balm.'

Simples: Jerry Hall and daughter Georgia May Jagger revealed they use Simple skincare products at home

The Strictly Come Dancing girls have previously revealed their love of a beauty bargain.

Kimberly Walsh and Denise Van Outen as well as
supermodel Jerry Hall have all talked about their love of Simple's 
low-cost skincare products.

Kimberly and Denise both used the wipes backstage, while Jerry says she and her daughter Georgia May use Simple at home.
