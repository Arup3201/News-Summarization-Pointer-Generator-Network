Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman has warned clubs interested in Gary Medel that they will not sell their £10million record signing at a loss.

Medel is expected to leave the relegated club after the World Cup, with Valencia leading a group of La Liga sides interested in the midfielder.

The Chilean is understood to have a release clause in his contract which approximately matches the fee Cardiff paid Sevilla last summer - a fee that started at £10million, but featured significant additional payments.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously said Medel ‘deserves to be playing at a higher level than the Championship’ and the 26-year-old’s impressive performances at the World Cup have supported those claims after a mediocre season in Wales.

But Dalman insists no offers have been received and strongly indicated that Medel will not be allowed to leave for less than the record fee Cardiff paid.

He said: ‘After what he’s been doing out in Brazil, there may well be a few offers on the table at the end of the tournament.

‘If so, and Gary comes to me and says he wishes to leave, I will engage in those discussions then.

‘But even if that were to be the case, I think it’s fair to say I’m not known as a pushover in negotiations. I’m not in the habit of selling anything at a loss.’

Sportsmail revealed in December the sizeable outlay of Medel’s signing, with his initial £10m fee possibly rising to £15m dependant on clauses. There was also an agent’s fee of £800,000, a signing-on fee of £1.25m, an image-rights fee of £1.6m for a player who rarely gives interviews, and a weekly basic wage of £35,000.  

Dalman added: ‘I hope that once this tournament is over, he will choose to stick around and help us try to regain our place in the Premier League. I’ve had no indication whatsoever from Gary that he may want to go.

Cardiff boss Solskjaer has said that Medel should be playing at a higher level than the Championship

‘People may say that Gary is too good for the Championship. But then we’ve got lots of players who are good enough to play in the Premier League.

‘I’ve no doubts that after what Gary has been doing in this World Cup, there will be interested parties out there.

‘But he is under contract to Cardiff City and sometimes it’s not necessarily about the league you play in, it’s about the club you play for and their ambition.

‘We’ve made six summer signings already and have set out our stall to try to regain instant promotion.’
