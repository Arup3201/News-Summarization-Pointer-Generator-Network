Kim cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel last month, after the Sultan of Brunei introduced Sharia law calling for gays to be stoned

Now, she joins the likes of Russell Crowe and Rose McGowan hitting out at the Hollywood boycott of the revered 102-year-old retreat

Reality star claims the loss of business 'doesn't even make a dent in the Sultan's fortunes'

Refuses to punish 'hard-working' staff that she has known since she was a little girl

Kim Kardashian has become the latest celebrity to speak out against the Hollywood boycott that has crippled the business of The Beverly Hills Hotel.

The hotel is said to have been almost empty in recent months after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, introduced Sharia law in the Southeast Asian state, which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death.

In a lengthy post on her website, Kim, 33, has confessed that after originally supporting the protest - including cancelling her planned bridal shower at the hotel last month - she has now had a change of heart.

Speaking out: Kim Kardashian has weighed into the Hollywood boycott of The Beverly Hills Hotel in a lengthy blog post where she champions the 'hard working' staff of the establishment

Kim explains that while 'the actions and law enforcements of the Sultan are completely against everything we believe in' the reality star is worried for the staff of the hotel, some of whom she has known since she was a little girl.

'For a sultan that has 20 billion dollars, this loss of business doesn’t even make a dent in his fortunes,' Kim writes, in a blog most titled 'My thoughts'.

'But the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now.'

Joining forces: Russell Crowe has also spoken out against the ban

She added: 'We shouldn’t punish the amazing hard-working people who have been so good to us for years! When I was a little girl, I would ride my bike to the Beverly Hills Hotel on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad (her lawyer father, Robert Kardashian)'.

Kim even revealed that during her pregnancy with daughter North West, she had befriended a waitress at the hotel who was also with child, and were both due just a few weeks apart.

'We would always share our pregnancy stories with each other. I know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed, so this boycott is affecting her tremendously,' she remembered.

Kim had been part of a growing number of stars, including Ellen DeGeneres, Sharon Osbourne and Stephen Fry who have boycotted the Dorchester Collection hotels - including the revered 102-year-old retreat - in protest at the law.

Now, the reality star has joined the likes of Russell Crowe and Rose McGowan who have hit back at the ban by celebrities.

Last month, Russell wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers his 'friends'.

Meanwhile, Charmed actress Rose decided to hold a 'gay-in' cocktail party at the hotel, rather than boycott it.

She wrote: 'I want to assemble a group of men and women (and hopefully some adulteresses,) that would be stoned in Brunei but that will be welcome at the BH,'

Kim also made clear in her post that the 'unjust treatment and violation of rights of the LGBT community around the world is never justified and I will continue to proudly support the LGBT community in every way imaginable.'

Meanwhile, the hotel is said to have promised to guarantee the jobs, income, gratuities, and benefits of all of its employees following the international backlash against the Sultan’s horrific new laws.

My Thoughts

My best friend Allison and I wanted to take our babies out to lunch a few days ago after our baby class but there were so many paparazzi swarming us, it would have really scared them. Instead we had to feed them at her place and put them down for a nap. We were planning on taking them to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is where we always go because they respect not having any paparazzi drive onto their property, but I reminded Allison that my bridal shower was moved from that hotel due to the actions of the Sultan of Brunei. Allison shared with me her view on the situation and we 100% agree that the actions and law enforcements of the Sultan are completely against everything we believe in.However, I started to realize that maybe boycotting the hotel isn’t the best solution either. For a sultan that has 20 billion dollars, this loss of business doesn’t even make a dent in his fortunes. But the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now… We shouldn’t punish the amazing hard-working people who have been so good to us for years! When I was a little girl, I would ride my bike to the Beverly Hills Hotel on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad, and some of the same people still work there! It’s sad to see them suffering from this protest.There must be other ways to express our views without punishing the workers, some who I know personally have families at home and depend on the city’s business and tips to survive. When I was pregnant, the hotel was my safe haven. There’s one waitress that works downstairs who was also pregnant at the same time as me and due just a few weeks apart. We would always share our pregnancy stories with each other. I know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed, so this boycott is affecting her tremendously. The hotel is a piece of LA’s history as well as many of our own personal memories.I support Rose McGowan and Russell Crowe’s takes on this matter. The unjust treatment and violation of rights of the LGBT community around the world is never justified and I will continue to proudly support the LGBT community in every way imaginable. I do believe though that instead of this boycott, there has to be another solution. I’m glad to hear that industry executives like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Casey Wasserman are reaching out to leaders of the hotel chain to discuss a way to potentially end the protest. I hope we can come together and stand up for our beliefs while still making sure good people aren’t wrongfully hurt in the process. Boycotting the hotel won’t affect the sultan, just our dear friends who work there. For every warm smile when they greet us and for all the dedication they put in to make our experiences more enjoyable, I hope we can return the same love and compassion to make sure they’re not forgotten during this protest. XoWith love, Kim
