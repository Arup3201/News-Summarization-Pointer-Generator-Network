Manchester City will come out on top in one of the closest Premier League title races of all time this season, closely followed by Chelsea, according to Bloomberg Sports data.

The world's leaders in sports analytic technology revealed their annual season predictions on Wednesday, calculating the percentage probabilities for league finishes using match analysis.

Based on their accurate readings it should be a happy season for City especially, while their Manchester rivals are expected to make the top four under Louis van Gaal. But Aston Villa may be heading out of the Premier League for the first time...

Glory days: Manchester City could be celebrating another title win at the end of the 2014/15 season

Final table: Bloomberg's table is calculated from efforts in previous seasons as well as transfer changes

Race for the title: Games were simulated 100,000 times to work out Premier League contenders

Back on the march: Data suggests Louis van Gaal could lead Manchester United back into the top four 

Premier League woe: But it could be a glum season for Aston Villa fans, with relegation predicted

Bloomberg power ratings and multiple data points from numerous seasons of every team are analysed, supplemented by the additional value that each club gained from the transfer window.

Once this Bloomberg Sports rating is calculated using the data above, each match of the 2013/14 season was simulated 100,000 times  providing an accurate sample

League projections are based on probability of finishing top, in Champions League positions, top or bottom half, or chance of relegation

Goals for and goals against also taken into consideration

Accuracy is tested against bookmaker odds, with strong results 

League table is updated throughout the season 

The graphic suggests it should be a two-horse race for the trophy this year.

Manchester City are given a 38.7 per cent chance of retaining their title, while Chelsea are ranked at 38.4 per cent as Jose Mourinho looks to galvanise his new squad.

The nearest challengers are Arsenal (8.5 per cent), Manchester United (7.5 per cent) and Liverpool (5.8 per cent), whose Bloomberg rating will have decreased given the departure of star striker Luis Suarez this summer.

Tottenham and Everton are the only other teams valued as having even a slight chance of glory, with other teams chances ranked below 0.05 per cent after their Premier League fixtures were simulated 100,000 times.

The race for the Champions League should also be fascinating this season. As you would expect, City and Chelsea have a probability of over 90 per cent to finish in the top four.

Arsenal, whose value will have supplemented after their transfer dealings, are expected to be in tight competition with United and Liverpool to extend their 17-year stay in Europe's finest competition.

Close: Arsenal, United and Liverpool were split by just three points, as their percentage probability suggests

Star signing: Arsenal's rating will have increased over the summer with the likes of Alexis Sanchez joining

Sure things: Diego Costa and Chelsea are heading for a title shoot-out with City

VIDEO Costa a key signing - Mourinho 

2.5 per cent chance that all three promoted teams get relegated

83.4 per cent chance that at least one promoted team does get relegated

23.7 per cent chance that Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal finish in the top three

88.0: average number of points needed to win the league

74.8: average number of points needed to ensure a top four finish

36.1: average number of points needed to avoid relegation

United suffered an uncharacteristic blip under David Moyes last season, but with Van Gaal at the helm they are down to beat their rivals to fourth place by just two points.

New signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw will help the cause at Old Trafford, and with more expected to arrive, don't be surprised to see the Red Devils move up the predicted league table as it is updated throughout the season.

Such is the helter-skelter of the Premier League, there are 12 teams who could be relegated according to the statistics.

Newcastle are in least danger, expected to finish eighth after some decent transfer action at St James' Park.

But for West Ham, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Leicester, West Brom, Hull, Aston Villa, QPR and Burnley the table makes much more grim reading. 

Pointing the way to go: Alan Pardew's Newcastle have been in fine form during pre-season

Straight back down? But Sean Dyche and Burnley's stay in the Premier League is expected to be brief

For the gap between 12th and 19th at the end of this season could be just three points, with the Clarets slightly adrift on 34 points. QPR will be joining them down with Villa after a solitary season in the top flight with Harry Redknapp.

Bloomberg's data system is aimed at beating the bookies, and with Burnley at 57.8 per cent to be relegated, it may be best to get your money on now.

As last year's season proved, the Premier League is anything but easy to predict. But given the detail here, don't be surprised to see City be looking down on the rest of the field come May.
