A shop in Bristol accidentally put Manchester United's new away kit on sale before it was officially released by the club.

JD sports employees were quick realise their mistake and took the all-white kit off the shelves, but not before pictures of it had spread across social media.

Man Utd fan Craig Smoothy was the first to spot the kit and uploaded a photo to Twitter.

Speaking to MEN, the 24-year-old said: 'I went in to buy the new home shirt but whilst I was a browsing I saw the white one. I couldn't believe it. I looked at it and thought that must be the away kit.

'I looked at the tag and it said 'Manchester United Away Jersey 2014/15.

'I went to another shop to see if they had it but they told me it wasn't even on sale until the 23rd and they started making phone calls. When I went back to JD it had been taken off the shelves and the staff all looked a bit panicked.

'I'm gutted I didn't buy it now as I would have been the first fan to own it. I really like it, though, and I'll definitely be buying it when it comes out properly.'

New man: LVG with Giggs and Woodward yesterday morning

Training: Louis van Gaal's first training session with the United players

Coaches: The Dutch manager with his backroom staff at Carrington earlier today

Neither Manchester United nor JD Sports has commented on the incident but fans will not have to wait too long before seeing their team playing in the new white kit.

Louis van Gaal's men opening game is at home to Swansea but they have away trips to both Sunderland and Burnley towards the end of August.
