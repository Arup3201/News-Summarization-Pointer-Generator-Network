Schools will be pushed to breaking point as they struggle to find room for almost a million more pupils within the next decade, council leaders warned yesterday.

The squeeze will reach ‘tipping point’ as schools lack the space or money to expand further, according to the Local Government Association.

It said council taxpayers alone could not absorb the £12billion cost of an extra 900,000 primary and secondary places needed – and accused the Government of failing to make up the shortfall.

Around 900,000 extra pupils in England's schools over the next decade is set to squeeze schools to breaking point, Town Hall chiefs have claimed

The Association urged the Government to ensure that all school places are fully funded and to enable councils to open new schools according to the needs of the local community.

The warning triggered a political row last night as the Tories blamed Labour for previous spending cuts while allowing immigration to get ‘out of control’.

Labour in turn accused Education Secretary Nicky Morgan of ‘shocking complacency’ by suggesting it was acceptable for class sizes to rise above 30.

Population projections suggest that the 7.14million children in England’s schools will rise above 8million by 2023. 

Many schools are already going to extraordinary lengths to find more room, converting old offices, shops and police stations – and even a double-decker bus.

Central First School in Ashington, Northumberland, bought the vehicle for £5,000 on eBay instead of forking out ‘astronomical’ sums of up to £150,000 to expand the school. 

Conservative Minister Nick Gibb blamed the school places squeeze on the last Labour government's failure to plan for the future

The Local Government Association's call comes just days before the January 15 deadline for mums and dads to apply for primary school places for this September.

The organisation has warned that councils need extra help with funding ‘before time runs out’

Applications are expected to be made for around 370,000 three and four-year-olds who are due to start school in the autumn.

The LGA said town halls were ‘pulling out all the stops’ to ensure every child has a place but the scale of the crisis was ‘too much for council taxpayers to pay for alone’.

There have been ongoing concerns about pressure on school places, particularly for primary-age children, fuelled in part in recent years by a rising birth rate.

Councillor David Simmonds of the LGA said: ‘We fear a tipping point could soon emerge when councils and schools can no longer afford the massive costs for the creation of places, nor find the space necessary for new classes, if this crisis is not properly dealt with.

‘Additionally, councils face a challenge creating places on time and in the right places when their hands are tied by red tape.' 

Around 90,000 places were created in 2012/13 by councils, and more are being established - but the scale of the problem is too big to be solved at a local level, the Association insisted. 

A survey by Labour suggests almost one in five primary schools is already full to bursting. But Tory schools minister Nick Gibb accused the last Labour government of failing to ‘plan for the future’ during a baby boom by cutting school place funding while allowing unchecked immigration.

The Coalition, he claimed, had put an extra £5billion into new places and spent £18billion improving buildings. 

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to provide more school places amid a squeeze on the schools budget

Mrs Morgan told Radio 4’s Today show that spaces would be provided by academies and free schools. ‘By the time we get all the free schools in the pipeline up and running, they will be providing over 200,000 new places across the country,’ she said.

The minister said she had visited a school that had ‘more pupils than expected’ but which was happy to absorb the increase. Class size was important but so was the quality of education, she added. 

In 2013, a study by the National Audit Office (NAO) warned that by September 2014 an estimated extra 256,000 primary and secondary school places would be needed to meet demand. Of these, 240,000 were required in primary schools, with more than a third (37%) needed in London alone.

Separate research conducted by the Times Educational Supplement last year concluded that hundreds of thousands of pupils could end up with less room to play outside because a squeeze on school places has meant classrooms are being built on playgrounds and playing fields.

Information on school expansions from 82 local authorities suggests that just over a third (35%) of primary schools that have grown or are due to grow in size will end up with less outdoor space for youngsters.

A further 54 per cent are not due to lose space, but will have more pupils using the same area, the research found.   

Sir David Attenborough has warned that pupils could be ‘disconnected’ from nature if playing fields are built on to ease the school places crisis.

The veteran broadcaster, 88, warned against sacrificing grounds because they may be the only place children encounter the natural world – which he said is essential to the ‘human spirit’.

In a campaign film for charity Learning through Landscapes, Sir David said pupils must grow up to know and appreciate nature to understand why it needs to be protected. He added: ‘And if they do not protect it – who will?’
