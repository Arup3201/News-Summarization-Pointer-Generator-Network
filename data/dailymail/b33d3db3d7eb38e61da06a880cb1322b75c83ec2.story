Two gardeners have described the heart-stopping moment they discovered a corpse at the bottom of a well in a Surrey village.

Rory Mulholland, 21, from New Addington, Surrey, and his 17 year old colleague Jack Duncan found the body as they worked at a house in Warlingham, Surrey, on Friday.

Mr Mulholland said: 'I thought "It can't be a body, then we saw skin with hair on it.

'I was shaking. I said "what should we do?"'

He told the Croydon Advertiser: 'It was definitely a man. You could tell by the size of his thighs, he had builder’s legs.

'I was shocked because I had been working right next to it. I’d even sat on the well to have a cigarette with the body beneath me.'

Mr Duncan added: 'I didn't really know it was a body to start with. I was poking it, turning it over in the water,' reports The Sunday Mirror:

Seven Polish men, aged between 21 and 27, have been bailed until a date in late December, pending further investigation.

The
 gardeners found the body of a white adult as they cleared the front 
garden of the large property, which stands in an acre of grounds.

The body was partially submerged in water in the 11ft well. A local resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is really shocking. You do not expect it here. It is a really quiet, well-to-do area.’

A neighbour, who only gave his name as Ben, said: 'I actually looked down that well two months ago.

'There was lots of rubbish. It's so weird to think I've looked down there and now there's a body down there. It's so bizarre.

'I was on my way back from work and my girlfriend said there's a body been found in the well outside the Polish house. I couldn't believe it.

'I see them in the local shop all the time, they're friendly.'

Grandmother-of-four Val Sloane, 67, who lives in Audley Drive with her husband Graham, 64, said: 'It's unbelievable, in such a quiet road, it's quite frightening really.

'Yesterday (Friday) I got home about 2.30pm and heard lots of car doors slamming and looked out of the window and there was the police.

'Then more and more people arrived and I knew it was serious because they cordoned it off.

'It's a nice road, this kind of thing can happen anywhere. I hope it's over and dealt with soon and they catch those responsible.'

Police divers removed the body yesterday and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out at East Surrey Hospital mortuary this afternoon.

Gardeners working at the house, set within an acre of land, spotted the body in the well in Surrey

Detective Chief Inspector Cliff Lyons,
 of the Metropolitan Police’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said 
the arrested men were aged between 21 and 27.

‘This is a 
murder investigation,’ he said. ‘As far as I am concerned, when a body 
is found in a well it either fell in there or was placed in there. The 
evidence suggests that the body was placed in there.’

He said the body presented a number of logistical challenges, requiring a police marine diving team with breathing apparatus to recover it intact to preserve forensic evidence.

'The well is two feet in diameter, it is seven feet deep to the water line, and the water is approximately four feet deep,' he said.

Specialist divers, pictured, were called to the scene and were assessing how to remove the body without destroying any evidence

He said it was not possible to be sure
 of the body's gender, but judging by the size it was most likely to be 
an adult. The person was white but he could not confirm the gender.

Mr Lyons told reporters at the scene: 
'It's not been there for an extended period of time; it will be a matter
 of weeks at the most.'

He was not prepared to discuss who lived in the house, or a suggestion that the body was wrapped in carpet. He could not confirm whether the body was intact.

Asked about claims by local residents that there had been quite a bit of trouble in the past couple of years with the people who lived in the house, and that police had been called many times, he said: 'The residents have expressed concern, there is intelligence to support that notion, yes.'

Evidence found by the divers at the scene indicated that the body had been placed in the well, police said

The gardeners were tidying up at the 
property, which is set in an acre of land on a road of semi-detached 
properties, when they spotted the body.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Specialist officers, including Metropolitan Police divers, attended the scene and the process of recovering the body from the well has been completed.'

The suburban cul-de-sac comprises around 50 semi-detached homes and sits opposite a sports field. Houses on the road have an average asking price of £370,000.
