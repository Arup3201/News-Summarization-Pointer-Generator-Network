An insect enthusiast has been warned by police after releasing 1,000 crickets into his garden because he likes the noise they make.

Daniel Emlyn-Jones bought the crickets for £40 from an online shop that sells live food for reptiles, then set them free in his garden to recreate the sounds of their Mediterranean home.

Although his neighbours enjoyed the sound of the crickets, police still issued Mr Emlyn-Jones with a warning because the foreign insects could harm the local wildlife.

Police decided that Mr Emlyn-Jones, a church warden and private tutor in maths and science, had contravened the Wildlife and Countryside act, so handed out an Adult Restorative Disposal.

PC Dean Kingham, a Thames Valley Police wildlife officer, said: 'The man released the insects as he liked the sound they made.

'While this sounds innocent, the introduction of animals not normally resident in the population can cause, at best, disruption to the local wildlife.

'At worst, it can cause damage by spreading disease or creating artificial populations.'

Mr Emlyn-Jones declined to comment on his police warning, but police confirmed he had since used traps bought from a pest control company to get rid of the insects.

In an interview with the Independent last month, however, Mr Emlyn-Jones said that he didn't 'didn't know what to expect' when he released the creatures, and that he had taken to feeding them muesli.

'The idea of keeping crickets for their songs is rooted in ancient Chinese and Japanese culture', he told the paper, 'But I didn’t want to cage them, but let them be free.'

While his neighbours can still hear the crickets, they say it is not an issue for them.

Patrick Gray, 65, a neighbour and former city councillor, enjoyed the noise.

He said: 'It was very loud and very cheerful and sounded like a night in the Mediterranean.

'However, I would not be in favour of people bringing new species in.'

The chirping was not set to last too much longer, as Gryllus bimaculatus, commonly known as Mediterranean crickets, have a short life-span of just eight weeks.

The insects’ native habitat is tropical and sub-tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Europe and they produce their distinctive chirp by rubbing their two outer wings together.

James Hogan, curator at the Oxford 
University Museum of Natural History, said: 'The problem with releasing 
alien species is that you do not know what effect they may have.

'They might carry diseases.

'Gryllus bimaculatus make loud chirps, but I’m sure Mr Emlyn-Jones can buy CDs with cricket songs on instead.'

Purchasing large amounts of insects over the internet - like Daniel Emlyn-Jones did - is perfectly legal.

Many reptile owners use online suppliers to buy live food for their snakes and lizards.

But releasing animals into the wild has the potential to be an offence if - as in this case - they pose a risk to the natural habitat.

It is also legal to buy larger animals, such as a dog or cat, over the internet, though there has recently been a push for tighter regulation of pet-selling websites.

On Wednesday the Pet Advertising Advisory Group (PAAG) announced a set of minimum standards of animal retailers.

The new rules came after reports of illegal animals such as arctic foxes and marmosets being advertised, as well as a slew of deals offering to 'swap' pets for items like mobile phones and watches.

The new rules insist website must blacklist sellers who offer illegal breeds and species, end the practice of swapping pets for goods, and insist that sellers show they are properly licensed.
