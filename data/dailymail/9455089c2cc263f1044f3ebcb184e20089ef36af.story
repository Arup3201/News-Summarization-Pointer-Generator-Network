A pensioner kept 18 cats, five rabbits and three dogs living in squalid conditions and refused to allow the RSPCA to inspect his home.

But when inspectors did manage to enter the house they found a total of 26 animals, some deprived of water living in appalling conditions in Hunts Cross, Liverpool.

The house belonged to Raymond Coll, 66, who claimed he did not live at the property but was a builder carrying out maintenance work while the owners were away.

However, it later emerged that he had lived at the property with his wife for 16 years and had even shoved a female inspector out of the door and locked her out at one point.

Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard that RSPCA officers were alerted by a concerned member of public to the presence of animals being kept in dreadful conditions.

They discovered three dogs without any water in the back garden, which was littered with building materials.

Officials also found a large number of cats hidden in cages in a small utility room and in dark cupboards without natural light, litter trays, ventilation, food or water.

Speaking in court, RSPCA inspector Louise Showering revealed the property was 'very untidy and unkempt'.

There were large amounts of household waste and building materials scattered around but she also said there was no sign of any building work taking place at the property.

Inspector Showering added: 'It was a hazardous environment not suitable for animals.'

She told Mail Online: 'There were animals all over the place.'

'They seemed to have gone to great lengths to make cubby holes to hide them away in, even in the gap in the back of a freezer where the motor would have been.

'It was very chaotic and not a suitable environment for any animal to be living in.

'This case was the largest number of animals I have ever seen in one place.'

The RSPCA said they were called to the home in August last year and since then, all the
animals have been signed over to them.

District Judge Ian Lomax found Mr Coll guilty of six offences under the Animal Welfare Act, including failing to meet the animals’ need for a suitable environment.

Mr Coll, who failed to appear in court, was also found guilty of failing to meet their need for a constant supply of fresh drinking water.

Judge Lomax said he was satisfied the offender had a connection with the property and that he had been 'evasive' throughout the proceedings.

He is due to be sentenced on June 12 and a warrant will be issued for his arrest if he fails to appear in court.

All the animals have since been re-homed.

Mr Coll was found
 guilty in his absence of six counts of failing to meet the needs of 26 
animals all contrary to section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act.

1 - Failed to meet the needs of five cats by providing a suitable environment.2 - Failed to meet the needs of three dogs by providing a suitable environment3 - Failed to meet the needs of 18 cats by providing a suitable environment4 - Failed to meet the needs of seven cats by housing them away from other animals5 - Failed to protect 11 cats from suffering by controlling and treating fleas6 - Failing to provide a constant supply of fresh drinking water to seven cats
