The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia cruise liner has admitted he was showing off when he attempted a dangerous salute to the island of Giglio, in a move which ended in disaster. 

Francesco Schettino is giving evidence for the first time about the 2012 shipwreck off the Italian island in which 32 passengers and crew were killed.

Schettino - who arrived 45 minutes late for his trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship - told the court he wanted to 'kill three birds with one stone'.

The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is giving evidence for the first time about the 2012 shipwreck off an Italian island in which 32 passengers and crew were killed.

Schettino appeared to be smothering a smile as he faced court. He has admitted he was showing off when he attempted a dangerous salute to the island of Giglio, in a move which ended in disaster

Schettino told the court he wanted to 'kill three birds with one stone', and had performed the salute to please the ship's head waiter, whose family came from Giglio, to impress a friend who was staying on the island, and to provide a night-time view for passengers

Schettino denied taking the route near Giglio island to impress a Moldovan dancer he had brought to the bridge. 

The woman has testified the two were lovers.

He said had performed the salute to please the ship's head waiter, whose family came from Giglio, to impress a friend who was staying on the island, and to provide a night-time view for passengers.

The disgraced former captain  - who arrived in court still wearing sunglasses - has long said he looked forward to his day in court to vindicate himself.

Schettino said he had previously navigated close to the island, and that it wasn't necessary to inform officials of ship owner Costa Crociere Spa on shore about the altered route since it was considered 'an approach' - not a 'touristic route.'

The ship hit rocks, creating a huge gash in the hull and forcing the evacuation of 4,200 passengers as the ship listed. 

His defence claims that no-one died in the collision itself, but that the failure of a back-up generator and supposedly water-tight compartments which were flooded created problems during the evacuation, when the deaths occurred.

He also denies abandoning ship, saying he was thrown into the water. 

Captain Schettino is on trial for multiple manslaughter, dereliction of duty and abandoning ship, and faces up to 20 years in prison if he is found guilty

Schettino is being tried alone after five other defendants reached plea bargains

Schettino arrived 45 minutes late for his trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship 

Schettino is being tried alone after five other defendants reached plea bargains. 

If convicted, he could receive up to 20 years in prison.

His lawyer described him as 'tense, concentrated' after he arrived at the court wearing sunglasses and with slicked hair.

The Telegraph reports he used an Italian phrase meaning 'to catch three pigeons with one bean' to explain why he had performed the risky manoeuvre.

He said it was a common spectacle for captains to steer close to islands.
