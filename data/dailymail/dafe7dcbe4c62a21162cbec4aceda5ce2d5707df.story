Cardiff boss Russell Slade has revealed new signing Scott Malone came close to joining Borussia Dortmund instead.

Malone, 23, drew interest from across Europe as his contract at Millwall ran down.

But the left-back plumped for a move to South Wales, rather than turning out for Jurgen Klopp’s side.

Boss Slade, told Wales Online: ‘Borussia Dortmund made strong enquiries about him, while there were other Championship clubs keen.

‘We are delighted Scott has signed. He is 6ft 2ins tall, athletic, will give us a lot going forward and defensively.

‘He is a natural left footed who has previously scored five goals in one season.

Birmingham and Brighton were other Championship clubs in for Malone.

The arrival of Malone adds competition for Declan John and Fabio and Slade made it clear he is looking for them to fight for their place.

Malone was also a target for German giants Borussia Dortmund - who  enquiried strongly about the defender
