A decorated British Army officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling ‘harassed’ by a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Brigadier David Martin, 57, ended his life after receiving phone calls and a ‘harassing voicemail’ over a £300,000 dispute involving his military charity.

Brig Martin was a director and trustee of UK4U Thanks, a charity founded in 2005 which works with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to deliver Christmas food parcels to troops in war zones.

Diane Martin - pictured with son Will, centre, and her late husband David - says the Brigadier felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who PR man Hugh Colver was representing

In a letter to friends and family breaking the news, his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to PR man Hugh Colver earlier this month, saying he felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who Mr Colver was representing.

In the letter, which was distributed on social media, devastated Diane Martin, 55, said: ‘David received an email on Sunday evening [March 1] which made him very agitated, and in his letter to me he said that the final straw was a harassing voicemail during the day from the same man.

‘It all concerned the UK4U Christmas box charity for which he was the chairman of trustees. The founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial (very substantial) outlay – despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams.

‘A high-powered PR man started to harass David for some sort of out-of-court settlement. Neither the charity nor the MoD could legally ‘pay off’ a claim that was unsubstantiated, so he concluded (again in his letter) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found ‘guilty’ in order that the claims could be settled.

‘Everyone knew that he would have done nothing wrong but he felt powerless to challenge the allegations and didn’t have the resilience or energy to go through such a potentially traumatic period.’

Just hours after speaking to Mr Colver, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, Brig Martin wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his Cotswolds family home near Avening in Gloucestershire.

'Brought in to mediate': Hugh Colver said he was 'deeply saddened' by Brig Martin's death

When questioned by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colver confirmed he had attempted to persuade Brig Martin to negotiate with businessman Stephen Briggs, who in 2005 provided UK4U with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start-up cash.

When the charity’s trustees refused to pay back Mr Briggs from UK4U funds, he started legal action. According to the charity’s 2008 annual report, an arbitrator found the businessman was owed funds. The report adds that UK4U accepted the award but that Mr Brigg’s company ‘claimed further amounts’.

Mr Colver, from Westbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘As far as I know Brigadier Martin and I did not know each other previously but he was aware of who I was and my background. I was brought in to mediate.

‘Our conversations were very reasonable and I got the impression he felt I was genuinely trying to help. He even thanked me for my efforts. He was surprised that the issues were still around, he thought it was all sorted by the arbitration and I said, well, unfortunately, it remains a dispute. The way the conclusion was arrived at is regarded, by some people, as invalid. The dispute is over several hundred thousand pounds and is very complicated.’

A friend of Brig Martin claimed that Mr Colver adopted an ‘icy tone’ in their conversations, but the PR man insisted: ‘I absolutely refute any suggestion that I was threatening and I was deeply saddened to learn of his death, this is tragic, ghastly.’

When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Briggs said: ‘It is a very difficult situation and we are very saddened by the news. Hugh Colver is our mediator and he knows the true side of the story and I would listen very carefully to him.’

Brig Martin was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) during a glittering military career. His funeral was held yesterday.
