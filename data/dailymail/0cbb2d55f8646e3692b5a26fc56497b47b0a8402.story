Wayne Rooney has asked to start Louis van Gaal’s first game in charge of Manchester United at the Pasadena Rose Bowl on Tuesday night.

The England striker is in America with his team-mates after returning to training following a disappointing World Cup in Brazil.

And new United assistant manager Ryan Giggs has revealed that the 28-year-old is raring to go ahead of Thursday's game against LA Galaxy in California.

Giggs said: 'Everyone will be involved in the first game. Wayne looks really good. Actually all of the World Cup lads have come back looking really sharp.

'The World Cup boys are a bit behind in terms of their fitness, with the other lads who have been back 10 days or so, but no, Wayne looks good, along with the rest of the lads.

'Wayne really wants to play.'

Van Gaal has said he will assess all of his new players on this two-week tour of the USA before making decisions on players’ future. He has also not indicated yet who will be captain.

Giggs said: 'The players are trying to impress in training and they'll be trying to impress in the game against LA Galaxy.

'That's definitely the case when a new manager comes in. You want to be on that team-sheet for that first game of the season against Swansea, so you do everything you can to do that.

'It always matters who the captain is. It's a tremendous honour. Not many people get to captain Manchester United, so whoever it will be, it will be a tremendous honour.

'It's one of the things we discussed first when I met Louis. Obviously, with the leaving of the experienced players, it's one of the decisions we are prioritising. 

'The decision hasn't been made yet. Louis is still getting to know the players. He's still trying to see their qualities.

'Like I said, about the likes of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans, maybe a player like that will thrive from it, take charge and come out of their shell.'
