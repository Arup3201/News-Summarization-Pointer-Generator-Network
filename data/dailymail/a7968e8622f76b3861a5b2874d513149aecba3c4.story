The Duchess of Cambridge was tonight consulting with doctors over whether to go ahead with her first solo foreign royal trip to Malta this weekend.

Kate, 32, who is around eight weeks pregnant with her second child with husband, Prince William, has been suffering from hypermesis gravidarum, a severe vomiting condition.

The illness saw Kate hospitalised in the early weeks of her pregnancy with her first baby, Prince George, now one.

The Duchess of Cambridge (last pictured with Prince William on August 5) has consulted doctors over her impending trip to Malta after suffering severe bouts of morning sickness in the early stages of her pregnancy 

The Duchess is due to represent the Queen this weekend on a two-day visit to the Mediterranean island as Malta celebrates the 50th anniversary of its independence from Britain.

The trip was seen as being a sign of Kate's growing royal role, not least because the island holds such a special place in the Queen's heart.

The monarch spent many happy months there before she acceded to the throne when her husband, Prince Philip was stationed there with the Royal Navy.

Royal sources have told the Mail that the Duchess is hanging on to the last possible minute to decide whether she is medically fit to go. 

The Duchess of Cambridge suffered the same illness throughout her first pregnancy with Prince George and was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital 

The trip to Malta is to be one of the first in which the Duchess of Cambridge acts alone on behalf of the Queen

'She has been terribly sick again but is desperately keen to go if she can,' said one.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said last night:'The Duke and Duchess will make a final decision this evening, in consultation with the Duchess's doctors.'
