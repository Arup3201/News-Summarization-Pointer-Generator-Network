Liverpool are to open discussions over a new contract for defender Martin Skrtel.

The 30-year-old is regarded as one of Brendan Rodgers' senior players now and with the pending departure of Steven Gerrard, the club is looking to keep a core group together to aid continuity and the development of their younger players.

Rodgers is looking to bring in a new goalkeeper, midfielder and striker over the next few months but Skrtel has established himself as one of the mainstays after a difficult period last season when his place and future was under question.

Skrtel has been at Liverpool for seven years and is in the final 18 months of his contract.

Liverpool have come under criticism over their handling of talks with Gerrard, who said he would have signed an extension to his contract had such a deal been available last summer rather than in November. 

They have opened discussions with captain-elect Jordan Henderson and are close to agreeing terms with Raheem Sterling.

Skrtel said at the weekend: 'It is a great honour for me to play seven years for Liverpool. We’ve had some great moments together and I am really happy I am part of this all. Liverpool are now in my heart.'

Liverpool have confirmed the sale of Oussama Assaidi to Al Ahli Club for £4.7m.

The Moroccan winger ended a loan spell with Stoke City early in order to complete the switch to Dubai.
