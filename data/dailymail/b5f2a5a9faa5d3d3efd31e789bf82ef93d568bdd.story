Police have arrested a man and a woman over an attack on a 94-year-old who was severely beaten in her own home.

Great-grandmother Emma Winnall was found unconscious and covered in blood when carers came to check on her on Tuesday morning last week.

West Midlands Police today said a woman, 56, and a man, 28, were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham just before 6.30am on suspicion of assault. They have been taken to a police station in the West Midlands.

The arrests came after a £5,000 reward was offered today for information leading to a conviction in the case of the brutally beaten pensioner.

Battered: Emma Winnall was assaulted as she slept at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, some time between 9pm on April 30 and 9am the next morning.

She had a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger. The beating was so severe that the frail widow's palms were bruised from her attempts to protect herself, while blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed.

Mrs Winnall's son John, 65, said today he was 'relieved' at the arrests.

He said: 'I don't know much about it yet. I spoke to my sister this morning but she didn't know much either.

'I'm relieved there's been an arrest, it's good that they seem to be making progress.I was going to see my mother up the hospital this afternoon but I've got problems with my car.

'She's stable yes, a lot better than she was. It'd be great if they have caught who did this and got them off the streets, we will have to wait and see.'

Crimestoppers offered the cash reward in a move backed by West Midlands Police.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal said: 'I would like to thank Crimestoppers for offering this reward and say again that local people hold the key to finding who is responsible for this terrible attack.

'No-one capable of carrying out such a despicable attack deserves protecting.

'I’m asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police.'

A shocking picture released by her family in the days after the attack showed the full extent of the appalling injuries Mrs Winnall suffered to her face.

As her family appealed for help in finding her attacker yesterday, they revealed that Mrs Winnall, who is still ‘very poorly’ in hospital, has started to describe the awful moment she was assaulted.  

Her daughter said she had spoken of screaming for help in vain, while the palms of her hands are bruised from her attempts to protect herself.  The beating was so severe blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed.

The family have as yet refused to allow her to look in a mirror, because she was always so proud of having healthy skin and would be horrified to see her scars.

Mrs Winnall’s daughter Joyce Blencoe, 56, spoke last week from West Midlands Police headquarters with her brother John.

She said: ‘To see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood has been the most horrific nightmare. It’s broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came.’

Mrs Winnall, who lives in Moseley, Birmingham, worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. She relies on a wheelchair to get around, and has lived alone since her husband Frank died in 2006, aged 91. 

She has five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, some of whom have been by her side in hospital since the assault.  Her son Peter Winnall, 65, described on Sunday how his mother had woken up in hospital after being sedated for a couple of days and asked desperately whether someone was trying to murder her.

He said: ‘I spoke to Mum and she seems to be doing OK, although her speech is slurred, which is worrying.

‘The first thing she asked when she woke up was, “Was someone trying to murder me?” 

‘She also asked medics if she had any scars because she has always been proud of her beautiful skin. We have not yet had the heart to give her a mirror so she can see the extent of her injuries. It’s absolutely devastating.’

He added: ‘These thugs need to be caught as soon as possible. They have no right to be walking the streets and should be jailed and the key thrown away. You couldn’t print the words I’d use to describe the maniacs who did this.

‘The problem is these monsters have no deterrent these days and they know about all the soft sentences handed out even for attacking a defenceless old woman in her bed. Not only was she virtually deaf and blind, she also had a pacemaker fitted and had undergone two hip replacements.’

Last Sunday, police officers spoke to Mrs Winnall in hospital, where she is recovering after emergency surgery. She has been sedated for much of the time since the attack and had to have metal plates inserted into her arm.

Mrs Winnall described her ‘traumatic’ ordeal to officers and said she was completely at a loss as to why she would have been targeted.

Detective Chief Inspector Sab Johal said: ‘She can recall the incident and explained just how frightened she was during this senseless attack.

‘Like the rest of us, Emma is also really struggling to understand why someone would do this to her. She is not a rich woman and has lived in the area a long time. From what we can tell, she was also well liked by neighbours.

‘She was totally shocked. She can’t think of any reasons why somebody would attack her. She’s lived in the community for a long time and she’s still quite traumatised about that. We need to know who did this to her.’

Police said there were no signs of a break-in and that whoever attacked her took nothing from her home. The attacker is still on the loose and police are yet to establish any motive.

Authorities are re-examining CCTV footage from the area, while slowly eliminating names put forward by members of the public.

DCI Johal added: ‘It is a unique offence, it’s very rare, but the injuries suffered by Emma were quite horrific. The injuries she sustained would have been challenging for people half her age.

‘We’ve had a number of names put through to the investigation team but the appeal still goes out to the local community.’
