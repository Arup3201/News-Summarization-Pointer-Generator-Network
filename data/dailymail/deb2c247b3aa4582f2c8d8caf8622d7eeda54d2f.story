John Galliano, the disgraced former head of Dior, has landed himself a new job with Russian perfumery and beauty chain L'Etoile, starting May 22, according to Russian newspaper Kommersant.

The cryptic announcement was made on L'Etoile's Russian website yesterday, with a large faux newspaper spread headlined: 'John is Back!' - which originally fueled rumors that the controversial designer was to be their creative director.

Not so fast, says his spokeswoman, who revealed that specific details of his upcoming projects will be released in the next few days, but confirmed Mr Galliano has been quietly consulting for the brand for some months, according to WWD.

Back? John Galliano (pictured in January) has scored a job at Russian beauty company L'Etoile in what could be his first solid contract since he was fired from Dior after an anti-Semitic tirade in a Paris bar in 2011

L'Etoile is the largest perfumery chain in Russia, said to be similar to U.S. beauty franchise Sephora, and boasts 750 beauty stores which sell cosmetics and fragrances, Dior among the labels they carry.

Mr Galliano, 52, has been making tentative footsteps back into the spotlight since his infamous public meltdown in 2011, in which he was filmed in a series of racist and anti-Semitic outbursts in a Paris cafe.

The Gibraltar-born British designer, who was ousted from his position at the helm of Dior and his own self-named label, blamed his shocking behavior on his addiction to alcohol and says he has been 'trying to make amends' ever since.

Reflecting on the anti-Semitic rant, Mr Galliano told Vanity Fair last year that he threw up when he saw the video.

'It's
the worst thing I have said in my life, but I didn’t mean it.' he told 
the magazine. ‘I have been trying to find out why that anger was 
directed at this race.

'I now realize I was so f****** angry and so discontent with myself that I just said the most spiteful thing I could.’

Comeback: Only a few weeks after he entered rehab, Kate Moss asked Mr Galliano to design her wedding dress (pictured), an honor he later said 'saved' him

After a stint in rehab and two years of keeping his head down, he took on a month-long residency at Oscar de la Renta's studio in January of 2013, a move perceived by many to be his ultimate 'second chance' in the fashion world.

Mr Galliano received rave reviews for the collection that he co-designed with Mr de la Renta; many of its highly-praised looks including Galliano signatures that had not been seen on runways since his former heyday.

'I very strongly felt that when people fall, you should try to lift them up,' said Mr de la Renta, 81, of taking Mr Galliano under his wing. 'I think everyone in life deserves a second chance. I'm not sure about a third or fourth.'

He was then widely-tipped to take on a more permanent role at the Italian fashion house following the storming success of the show, but it wasn't to be. Last month it was reported by The New York Post that he and Mr de la Renta had failed to reach an agreement, with 'money the biggest factor.'

Mr Galliano, who also went on to design costumes for Stephen Fry's stage adaption of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, then made a more public re-appearance in October last year, when he served as guest fashion editor for the December issue of British Vogue.

The eccentric designer posed with long-time friend and supporter, supermodel Kate Moss, in a spread for the issue, roughly two years after he designed her stunning wedding dress.

Flamboyant: He was well known for his outlandish final runway looks and eccentric nature, but has been keeping a low profile since embracing sobriety and attempting to 'make amends' for his ways

Mr Galliano - who was asked to design the ivory gown mere months after he had been shunned by almost everyone else in the industry.

'Creating Kate’s wedding dress saved me personally because it was my creative rehab. She dared me to be me again,' he said.

His next big step with L'Etoile won't mark the first time the legendary designer has worked with perfume brands. During his career at Dior, he was said to be 'instrumental' in the Addict franchise and the adoption of Charlize Theron as the face of J'adore, amongst other accolades.
