A vigilante who attacked a convicted paedophile with a knuckle duster in the street has been jailed after telling police 'I would have killed him.'

Nathan Murray admitted unlawfully wounding the man, who has not been named, when he saw him outside shop in Rhondda Cynon Taf, South Wales last year.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard how the 21-year-old told the man: 'You shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets' as he struck him in the face with the weapon.

Nathan Murray, who was jailed for two years after attacking a convicted paedophile in the street with a knuckle duster 

Today, Murray of Aberdare was jailed for two years after being told it was not his place to 'mete out justice.'

The court was told how Murray saw the victim outside an off licence in Penywaun in Aberdare, South Wales.

The man was standing in front of Murray with a friend when he was aksed for some lager but the friend refused.

The victim then decided to give Murray a wide berth and tried to walk around him but he was then punched in the face twice with the knuckle duster, leaving him needing stitches. .

Murray was then arrested and later told police: 'I would have killed him because he is a pervert.'

The court also heard how Murray knew a teenager who had been assaulted by the paedophile.

Andrew Davies, defending, said: 'He harboured a grudge against th complainant, he knew one of his 13-year-old victims and felt personally compelled to act in an unjustifiable way.'

Merthyr Tyfil Crown Court, pictured, heard that Murray knew a 13-year-old who had been previously assaulted by his victim 

The court was told how the 21-year-old had 10 court appearances from 14 offences and had his hopes of joining the army dashed when he lost the sight in one of his eyes.

Judge Eleri Rees then handed down the two year jail sentence saying that Murray had an 'appetite for violence'.

He was also made the subject of an indefinite restraining order to protect his victim and also has to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

The judge said: 'What you know about the complainant is neither here nor there.

'It is not for you to mete out justice - that is for the court to do.'
