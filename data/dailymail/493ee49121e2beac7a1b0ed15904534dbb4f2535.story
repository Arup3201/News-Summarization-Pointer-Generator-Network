Even the most fearsome predators need a little time to relax. These six lions decided to put their paws up as they contemplated the day ahead.

But it seems they came to the conclusion that there was no urgent business to attend to – as within minutes of this early morning shot, three of them had fallen asleep.

Photographer Daniel Dolpire captured the line-up on the edge of the Serengeti, in  Tanzania.

The 59-year-old said: 'I have been taking wildlife photos for over 20 years, but this has got to be my special moment.

'I needed to work fast as you just do 
not know when they will move or just flop down and go to sleep. This was
just a unique, special moment. No one has ever seen or recorded such a 
special moment or possibly ever will.'

The father of three, from South 
Africa, snapped the three-year-old males, from the 30-strong Black Rock 
pride, during a trip around Tanzania and Kenya with his wife.

They had 
stopped over at the picturesque Klein's Camp on a group safari  of the 
Serengeti National Park when Mr Dolpire spotted the lions lounging on 
the edge of the Salt Lick, a tributary of  the Grumeti river. 'Exactly 
six minutes later the first lion got up and within another five minutes,
three were sleeping and the others had gone off into the bush,' said Mr
Dolpire.

The Black Rock pride is the reserve's 
largest, made up of eight adult females, two dominant males, seven 
younger  'sub adults' and five cubs. There are eight young males. The 
six pictured share the same father.

Male lions commonly leave their 
original pride when they reach maturity, at around the age of four. In 
the wild, they have a life expectancy of ten to 14 years.

Adult males typically measure 8ft to 9ft from the tip of their nose to the tip of their tail, and can weigh as much as 40st.

Time for a snooze: Mr Dolpire from South Africa, had just five minutes to take the photo before a pair of the lions fell asleep

'I needed to work fast as you just do not know when they will move or just flop down and go to sleep.
