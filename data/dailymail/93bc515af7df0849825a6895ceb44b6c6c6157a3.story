HBO has announced that they are going digital.

The premium cable giant said in a statement today that starting in 2015 they plan to offer a stand-alone version of their popular video-streaming service, HBO GO.

This news means that subscribers would no longer need a cable subscription, or even a television, to view their content.

Cable giant: 'That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,' said HBO CEO Richard Plepler (above)

At an investor meeting at parent company Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday, CEO Richard Plepler said the move was made to target the 80 million homes that do not have HBO but would like to have access to its content.

'That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,' said Pepler.

'It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO.'

This move comes as companies providing on-demand Internet streaming media, such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime, continue to see their audiences grow.

Currently HBO has 114 million subscribers across the globe,offering movies, comedy and documentary specials and original programming.

No details about pricing were given, but Forrester analyst James McQuivey expects the stand-alone HBO service could cost about $15 a month.
