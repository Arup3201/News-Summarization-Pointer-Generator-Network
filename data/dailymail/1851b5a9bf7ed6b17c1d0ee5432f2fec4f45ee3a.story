A new line of men's underwear promises to block radiation waves from cellphones with a layer of silver shielding.

Belly Armor, which has for years manufactured clothing to protect pregnant mothers' bellies from non-ionizing radiation from mobile devices, will release their men's boxers Thursday.

The RadiaShield boxer briefs use silver threading in the crotch, which the company says will help 'protect men’s reproductive organs and maintain fertility health.'

Protection: Belly Armor's boxers, with a shielded crotch, are said to protect a man's fertility from the non-ionizing radiofrequency 

The New York Post reports that the sophisticated drawers were developed to address concerns raised in an American Society of Reproductive Medicine study suggesting a correlation between active cellphone use and decreased sperm count.

Spokesperson Katherine Niefeld said that men weren't demanding protection from their phones because they didn't know they needed it.

The study used by Belly Armor is based on talk time, not on men carrying cellphones in their pockets, so it may be the bigger danger is posed to the noggin and not the nuggets.

Researchers are less certain about the dangers that radiofrequency waves post to fertility and body tissue.

While the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health declares that ionizing radiation from X-rays and radiation therapy pose a cancer risk, no connections to health risks have been found for non-ionizing waves.

Dr Laura Riley, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital, told Time that products like those sold through Belly Armor are exploiting unproven health scares to sell clothing.

'There are no conclusive studies that have shown that low radiation from everyday devices is harmful to anyone, much less to a pregnant woman,' Riley said regarding the company's maternity line back in 2010.

There are even skeptical sperm scientists, such as Dr Allan Pacey, from Sheffield University, who isn't changing his cellphone habits any time soon.

Reacting to an Exeter University metastudy of 10 research trials looking at cellphone use and infertility, he called for 'properly designed' before conclusions could be drawn.

Speaking to the BBC, he says 'Until that time, I will be continuing to keep my iPhone in my right-hand trouser pocket!'
