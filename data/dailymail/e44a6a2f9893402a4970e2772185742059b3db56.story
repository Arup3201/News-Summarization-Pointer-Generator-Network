Predator: Walter Lee Williams, 65, accused of having sex with two boys, ages 13 and 14, entered a guilty plea to one count of engaging in illicit sexual contact in foreign places 

A former University of Southern California professor once named among FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives pleaded guilty Friday to flying to the Philippines to have sex with underage boys.

Walter Lee Williams, 65, entered a guilty plea in a Los Angeles court in exchange for a prison sentence no longer than five years, followed by 10 years of supervised release.

The disgraced professor of anthropology, gender and sexuality studies will have to pay $25,000 restitution, which will be divvied up among his seven victims, and he will also be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life

Appearing before District Judge Philip Gutierrez in a wheelchair Friday, Williams pleaded guilty to one federal count of engaging in illicit sexual contact in foreign places.

He was then returned back to jail, along the way smiling at his family members sitting in the audience and shrugging his shoulders, City News Service reported, via The Desert Sun.

Williams will be officially sentenced December 15.

Williams made international headlines in June 2013 when he was captured by Mexican authorities in the resort city of Playa del Carmen.

The disgraced educator had been placed on FBI’s list of Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in connection to sex crimes involving young boys living abroad.

Garcia said Williams was captured late Tuesday while drinking coffee near a park in the Caribbean beach town.

Mexican police caught up with the runaway USC professor on June 18, 2013, as he was enjoying a cup of coffee near a park in the Caribbean resort town.

Arresting officers were acting on a tip from someone who recognized the professor from his picture in a newspaper. 

A federal arrest warrant was issued for the former Palm Springs, California, resident in Los Angeles in April 2013, according to the FBI website.

The indictment alleged that Williams traveled from Los Angeles to the Philippines in January 2011 to engage in sex acts with two boys, ages 13 and 14, he met online in 2010.

While in the Philippines, Williams sexually exploited both boys, one of whom he also photographed in the nude. He also had sexual relations with a 15 year and three other boys, all aged 16.

Williams fled the Los Angeles area approximately one week after returning from the Philippines.

Until 2011, Williams was a highly respected tenured professor at the University of Southern California where his field of study was gender development and sexuality.

Williams was also affiliated with the Buddhist Universal Association of Los Angeles, California, according to the FBI.

‘Williams has an extensive history of travel throughout the South East Asia region, specifically the Philippines,’ the FBI said following his arrest. ‘He has reportedly resided in Indonesia, Polynesia and Thailand.’

Prosecutors alleged that Williams, a Fulbright Award winner once named USC’s Outstanding Teacher, used those foreign trips to prey on at least 10 children ranging in age from 9 to 17, reported the Los Angeles Times.
