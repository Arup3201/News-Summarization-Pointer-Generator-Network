Britain's top financial regulator has admitted that his organisation let down the country by failing to stop the economic crisis.

Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, described the years before the credit crunch as a ‘fool’s paradise’.

Giving a speech at a banquet in the Mansion House in the City of London last night, he slammed the ‘dangerous’ culture that had been allowed to exist at major banks which meant they cared more about profits and bonuses than their customers.

In a withering assessment of the FSA’s own failings, he admitted the regulator had allowed a set of ‘bad rules’ to remain in place and had shown ‘severe deficiencies’.

And he said that ‘ordinary’ people were still paying the price for the economic crisis which began in August 2007. He said: ‘The crisis was not a bolt from the blue.

‘It arose from poor supervision, from bad rules and structures, from dangerous cultures – and the errors were made by regulators, economists, central bankers and public policy makers, as well as bankers themselves.

‘A lot of apparently very clever people got it very wrong, and the ordinary citizen suffered. We have to do better in future.’

Lord Turner, a frontrunner to replace Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England when he retires next June, became FSA chairman in September 2008.

The American investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed, the emergency merger of HBOS and Lloyds had just been announced and the Icelandic banks were about to fail.

He said the timing of his new job was like ‘being appointed captain of the Titanic after we’d hit the iceberg but before we’d actually sunk.’

He said between 1999 – the year that the FSA was set up – and 2007, regulators thought it was ‘plain sailing’ with no ‘icebergs’. Lord Turner admitted: ‘But that was a delusion, the vulnerabilities relentlessly growing, but we didn’t spot them. It was ‘a fool’s paradise – the band playing on oblivious to the dangers ahead.’

He also admitted that he had been wrong when he called for Britain to join the euro in 2002. Critics say his mistake could prove a stumbling block to his chances of becoming the next Bank of England governor.

He said: ‘Ten years ago, I argued in favour of the eurozone project and for Britain’s eventual membership.

‘As I have said before, I was wrong, failing to recognise the inherent flaws in the eurozone’s current design. And it is important for both individuals and institutions to recognise mistakes and learn from them.’

n Barclays has announced it is to pay staff bonuses based purely on the service they provide customers. The new structure, which will apply to 18,000 frontline staff in branches and call centres, will come into force in December.

Chief executive Antony Jenkins said it is part of an urgent bid to win back the trust of its customers.

The move comes after the FSA said secret commission paid to staff had created a rotten culture where customers are viewed only as ‘sales targets’.

Lord Turner, once one of the most high-profile supporters of Britain joining the euro, admitted that he was wrong when he called for the pound to be ditched.

He told his Mansion House audience that he regretted his earlier views and said he had ‘learned’ from his mistakes.

Lord Turner – along with six others, including Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne – published a 40-page pamphlet in August 2002 entitled ‘Why Britain should join the euro’.

It said: ‘At each stage the opponents of the euro have forecast disasters which have never happened and always looked unlikely.’

They then wrongly claimed it was important to join the euro in order to improve living standards in Britain.

The pamphlet ended: ‘If once again we fail to join the European leaders, we risk falling further behind them.

‘There are of course pros and cons of joining the euro. We have tried to set them out fairly.

‘But we believe the arguments in favour are much the stronger. And the time to join will soon be upon us.’
