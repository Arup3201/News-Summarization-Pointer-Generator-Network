Wealthy Chinese tourists are splashing out up to £100,000 on hunting trips to Scotland, so they can feel like Downton Abbey's Earl of Grantham.

Inspired by the ITV series, hunting parties from China are hiring out castles with butlers and staff included so they can try their hand at bagging some of the biggest game roaming the countryside.

Shows such as Downton Abbey, which is a huge hit in China, and the Chinese media selling shooting as the 'sport of kings' has led to an increase of tourists to the UK, and more specifically Scotland.

The ITV series Downton Abbey is hugely popular in China and is credited with inspiring waelthy fans to try traditional British sports such as hunting

People visiting from China, have taken a particular shine to the country and are hiring out castles in some of it's most picturesque locations.

Among those visiting is Jack Ma, one of China's richest men. He recently hired out Aldourie Castle near Loch Ness for £36,000.

Mr Ma spent a week with 11 friends on the 500 acre estate, also hiring staff including a butler and cook.

The internet entrepreneur, worth £6.1bn, hired four helicopters for £1,000 an hour to fly him and his friends to some of the country's top shooting estates, where they shot 17 stags along with other game.

Mr Ma, like many of those visiting from China, had no shooting experience before his visit, due to the strict gun laws in his country which were brought in at the foundation of the People's Republic 65 years ago.

Lachie Smith, from the agent Highland Sporting, who led the group said: 'None of them had handled a gun before so we had to train them in the basics.

'Telling someone who has made billions that they can't do something is not easy, but if they shot one of the beaters that would not be funny.'

Although Mr Smith said that Mr Ma and friends had gotten to grips with the weapons fairly quickly, he admitted he had sent a man from another group home after he had taken dangerous shots at a deer.

Another wealthy businessman from China who recently visited Scotland for the sport bagged five five trophy deer - at a price of £5,000 a head - during one day's shooting on the Ardnamurchan peninsula.

The group stayed at the Glenborrodale Castle, which costs £10,000 a week.

Highclere Castle, in Berkshire, is where Downton Abbey is filmed and has also received a boost in visitors

Niall Rowantree, who runs West Highland Hunting and led the group, said that he receives up to 200 foreign hunters a year.

He said that until five years ago there had been almost no interest from Chinese tourists.

George Goldsmith, an agent in Edinburgh who organises shoots and sells sporting estates led a group of five Chinese shooters on a hunting trip in Fife.

He said: 'We let them completely immerse themselves in that hunting tradition.

'We kit them out with the tweeds and set them up on a private estate so they can be laird for a week. It's the ultimate experience.'

Mr Ma reportedly splashed out £36,000 on his stay at the luxurious Aldourie Castle in Scotland

He said that one Chinese client had enjoyed the experience so much that he had bought a farming estate in Hampshire and is now trying to acquire a shooting estate.

Charlie Jacoby, who runs the Fieldsports Channel, said: 'We're thrilled with the channel's success among Chinese viewers and it shows how accessible and popular the sport really is.

'The Chinese see nothing wrong with shooting, it's just surprising that people do here in Britain.'

Mr Li, office manager of Oriental International Hunting Park in Shanxi province, northern China, said: 'Hunting has really taken off in the past two or three years.

'It is just like the golf craze. It is still a relatively rare and exclusive experience.'
