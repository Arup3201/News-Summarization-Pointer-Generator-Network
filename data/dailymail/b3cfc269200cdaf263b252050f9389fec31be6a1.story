Romelu Lukaku has been backed to shine again at Everton this season by former team-mate Gerard Deulofeu.

The striker scored 15 Premier League goals during his loan spell at Goodison last season and impressed manager Roberto Martinez enough for him to spend £28million to permanently sign him from Chelsea earlier this week.

And Deulofeu - now back at Barcelona after spending last season on loan at Everton - believes his old team-mate will enjoy another successful year.

'I think Lukaku is a really great footballer - he helped Everton last year very much indeed,' Deulofeu said to the Express

'He has huge quality and I think he will do very well at Everton this season.

'The only thing I can say is that I wish the best for him - I am happy for him to go to Everton because he is going to have a great season, which will help him a lot.'
