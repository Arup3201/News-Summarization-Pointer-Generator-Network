Ex-postman David Livesey has been given a suspended sentence for stealing promotional meerkat toys intended for insurance customers

A postman stole dozens of meerkat toys destined for Comparethemarket.com customers and made hundreds of pounds selling them to collectors on eBay.

David Livesey, 61, made almost £1,500 in the scam, which at first appeared 'simples', the catchphrase of Aleksandr the Meerkat in the now-famous British TV adverts.

He helped himself to parcels which he recognised contained the collectors toys, which are handed out to customers of the insurance website.

But Livesey's cash-making scheme was brought to an end after Royal Mail investigators discovered that 78 of the highly-prized toys had gone missing.

They put an electronic tracking device in one of the meerkat parcels, which was later recovered after Livesey failed to deliver it.

Inquiries revealed he had sold the toys for between £5 and £43 a time - and he mailed them out to his eBay buyers with used postage stamps.

The 61-year-old, from Barnoldswick, Lancashire, also took several DVDs dispatched by Amazon during his two-year stealing spree.

Livesey, now jobless and living on benefits, admitted he was a thief when challenged by his bosses.

He admitted three counts of theft, which involved stealing a quantity of postal packets containing meerkats, stealing other postal packets between 2011 and 2014, and stealing the final packet on February 6 this year.

Appearing at Burnley Crown Court, he also pleaded guilty to having in his possession used postage stamps for use in connection with fraud.

He received six months in prison, suspended for a year, with a three month night-time curfew. He was also ordered to pay a £80 victim surcharge.

Gerard Doran, prosecuting for the Royal Mail, told the hearing Livesey had been employed by the Royal Mail for nearly 13 years, having started in 2001.

It was estimated he had stolen 78 meerkat toys and made a £1,430 profit by selling them through his eBay account.

The toys were only available when insurance was bought or renewed through a company which advertised on Comparethemarket.com.

Mr Doran said investigators conducted surveillance and two meerkat toys were introduced into the mail due to be sorted by Livesey.

Electronic tracking devices were placed in the packages and Livesey was watched while carrying out his round.

When challenged, he agreed to be searched and the tagged package was later found in his van.

When his home was searched, 31 used stamps and some DVDs were found. Eight boxes of meerkat postal packages with the address labels torn off were also discovered.

Mr Doran said Livesey denied he had stolen all the recovered items from the post. He said he intended to give the meerkat in the test package to his grandchild.

The toys given to customers of the website have become collectors items and were stolen by postman Livesey to sell on eBay

He admitted he had been stealing meerkat toys and selling them over the internet for over two years. He said he had the used stamps to dispatch goods sold on eBay.

Kristian Cavanagh, defending, said: 'He is ashamed to find himself before the court for the offences and has demonstrated remorse.

'He recently had a significant operation for liver cancer, his wound had become infected and he had been readmitted to hospital on Saturday.

'His financial circumstances are quite bleak. He has remained out of work since these offences.'

Sentencing, the judge Mr Recorder Anthony McLoughlin told Livesey he had been an experienced postal worker and had committed a breach of trust.

He said meerkat toys had some 'cult interest' to people seeking to acquire them and added: 'You had some financial difficulties. That only explains it. It doesn't excuse what you were about. It went on for over two years.'

He added: 'You have actually ruined the last 45 years of your working life by being found out for these offences.

'You have demonstrated genuine remorse rather than self pity for the circumstances you find yourself in.'
