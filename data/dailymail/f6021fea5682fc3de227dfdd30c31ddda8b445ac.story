A former guard at Rikers Island who was convicted of smuggling drugs into the prison has revealed he helped female colleagues prostitute themselves to inmates and senior bosses.

Ex-marine turned corrections officer Gary Heyward has made the explosive claims in his controversial memoir about his time as an employee at the notorious New York facility.

The Bronx native describes how he would have a list of demands and orders when he arrived at work every day, but the illicit scheme earned him more money than his annual salary which started at $28,000.

It included smuggling tobacco, drugs and cellphones to inmates and offering protection to three female prison guards who were selling sex. In the book he describes them as 'copstitutes'. 

Corruption officer: Gary Heyward, a former guard at Rikers Island, helped female officers prostitute themselves to inmates and jail bosses and later served time for running a huge smuggling operation at the prison

Before he got a job at the jail in 1996, he had served in Operation Desert Storm. 

His smuggling operation began when he saw a childhood friend, Biz, locked up on Rikers Island. He asked Heyward to pick up a carton of cigarettes which contained marijuana. 

According to the book titled Corruption Officer, an advanced copy of which was seen by the New York Daily News, the cigarette operation then skyrocketed. 

He would strap bags of tobacco to his body underneath his uniform to work and would sell $2 worth for around $200.

For $500 he would also deliver burner phones to an inmate and would set higher prices for more specific orders - such as liquor, coke, cooch and, in one instance, red velvet cupcakes. 

However he changed the direction of his venture when a competitor started selling cocaine. 

He picked up half an ounce of the substance from the sister of his prison distributor, he describes in the book as Flocko, who then managed to make $1,500 in just 15 minutes.

As the business grew a female correction officer, identified as Officer Rains, came to him and said she pouches for him if he  protected a the ring of three women who were prostituting themselves to inmates and other correction officers in return.  

Convicted: The corrections officer (pictured left in his uniform and right in a jumpsuit to promote his book) was jailed for two years in 2006 for selling drugs to inmates 

Money: Heyward started working at the New York facility in 1996, starting on a basic annual salary of $28,000. In his book he describes how his illicit scheme made him more money

Rains then discovered Heyward's business had become widely known while she was sleeping with a high ranking security official in a hotel.

He said to her during the encounter: 'If you want to get rid of all the drugs in the jail, get rid of Heyward.'

His colleagues also started to notice he was friendly with some of the inmates - who they described as losers. 

Eventually he was busted during an undercover operation. Authorities installed recording devices in Flocko's sister's van and captured one of his drug deals. 

Heyward was sentenced  to two years in prison in 2006 after admitting to attempting to sell cocaine to an inmate and providing another with a cell phone for $500. 

In the book he says his behavior was driven by his need for money - as he had outstanding child support and a gambling problem.  

He wrote the book while behind bars in the upstate facility Oneida. 

Speaking to the Daily News, he said: 'I’m proof that once you serve your time you can go straight again. I live a respectable life now.'
