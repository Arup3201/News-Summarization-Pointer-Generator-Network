A tractor spotted travelling along a busy motorway at 10mph was seized by police after they discovered the driver had no insurance.

The large red Case tractor was stopped between junctions 5 and 6 on the southbound carriageway of the M6 near Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham.

Officers from the Central Motorway Police Group seized the eight-tonne vehicle, worth around £50,000, after they spotted it at about 5.25am today.

Inspector Mark Watkins said: 'To see such a vehicle travelling on such a busy stretch of road was both unusual and quite a surprise for the patrol officers.

'Tractors are one of the various prohibited vehicles on the motorway network - a fact that the driver seemed to be unaware of.

'We received a few calls into us at around the time that we stopped the tractor from concerned motorists who were both shocked and worried that the slow nature of the tractor could create a hazard to other road users.

'The driver was given police advice regarding the laws of the road and taken from the motorway network.

'It was unclear where the driver was 
taking the tractor to and how far he was planning to travel along the 
network for, but either way taking the tractor onto the motorway posed a
 risk to himself and others, whilst breaking the law.

'The driver was left to make his own way home - minus his expensive tractor.'

The incident comes just days after officers stopped two men dressed as Superman on the M42 near Shirley, West Midlands.

The two men caught the attention of officers after they attached a red cape to the back of their Peugeot 106 as they drove to a fancy dress party on Saturday night.
