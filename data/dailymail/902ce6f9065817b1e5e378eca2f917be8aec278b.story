Gordon Strachan has told Scotland new boy Lewis Macleod to use Andy Robertson's rise through the international ranks as inspiration.

The Rangers midfielder has been given his first call-up for the European Championship qualifier against the Republic of Ireland and the friendly against England at Celtic Park on November 14 and 18 respectively.

The 20-year-old, capped at every level from Under-16s to Under-21s, has impressed the Scots' boss with his performances for the Championship club this season.

Strachan believes Macleod need only to look at 20-year-old Hull City left-back Robertson to see that he is 'not only there to make up the numbers'.

As a Scotland Under-21 player at Dundee United before his £2.85million move to England in the summer, Robertson was invited to a training session with the senior team and was soon promoted, making his debut against Poland in a friendly in March before becoming an established member of the squad.

'If things go well this week you never know what might happen,' said the former Southampton and Celtic boss.

'Young Andrew Robertson joined us for an afternoon and played against 11 versus 11 to work on certain things.

'After the game finished I asked the coaches who played well and apart from Scott Brown and James Morrison, he was man of the match.

Gordon Strachan believes it will benefit both Macleod and Scotland for him to join up with the squad

'I am looking forward to seeing him (Macleod) and working with him.

'I see him in the first game of the season and I caught up with videos and obviously other people watch games.

'So it is easy to find out if a player is playing well. We think it will be good for us to have him along.'

Meanwhile, Strachan expects Stuart McCall to be back in the management hot seat soon.

The Scotland coach resigned as Motherwell manager on Sunday following five consecutive Scottish Premiership defeats.

McCall had led the Steelmen to three successive top-three finishes and a Scottish Cup final appearance, as well as the Champions League qualifiers but left the Fir Park men second bottom in the table.

The 20-year-old Macleod has scored seven goals for the Ibrox club so far this season

Strachan said: 'I spoke to him and he is fine.

'He will be back again. At Motherwell, he was third, second, second - that is some going. Terrific.

'That won't be missed by other clubs throughout the country and it shouldn't be because he is a terrific guy, a terrific manager and players love playing for him as well.

'During the games he sees things, the information he gives us is invaluable.

'He has a good way about him, he links the players and staff together.

'There is no doubt he will be back in football soon - but it is nice to have a break now and then.'
