A leading professor has called on Australian policy makers to shorten the full time working week to 35 hours so parents have more time to spend with their young children.

Dr Lyn Craig, who works as a researcher at the University of NSW, has spent the last decade looking at the patterns of people's lifestyles in Australia. 

She has now released new research detailing the amount of time mums and dads spend working, looking after young children and carrying out household chores in comparison to those in the US, Denmark, France and Germany.

Mums and dads in Australia notch up more hours in paid and unpaid work

They also spend more time on childcare and doing household chores

Dr Craig told Daily Mail Australia that the current situation is 'unsustainable' and the government needs to shorten the number of full-time hours parents work because stress levels are 'extraordinary'. 

Dr Craig's research found that Australian mums and dads with young children under the age of four had a paid and unpaid heavier workload, she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Australian fathers with young children spent 10.51 hours a day on paid and unpaid work, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, in comparison with French fathers who had the easiest workload at an average of 8.5 hours a day. 

Dr Craig told Daily Mail Australia: 'Parents in Australia work long hours but the gender gap is quite extreme.

Professor Lyn Craig calls the current situation 'unsustainable'

'Men do a high number of paid hours and they do a lot more than French and Danish men. With that women are doing so much more paid and unpaid work.

'Australian fathers also do a lot of childcare, but if we want men to do more in the home then the workforce hours need to go down.' 

The research shows Australian men are equal highest with Danish men on how much time they use to look after their young children. 

Dr Craig said she was also worried about how stretched households are becoming. 

She added: 'Paid and unpaid work are necessary to making society work. 

'Childcare costs are going up and parents are spending more hours than ever with their children, the kids need more attention and spending more hours with your children is becoming more normal. 

'Childcare needs to be more accessible and a subsided system would be sufficient. 

'Mums and dads have to run out to get their children and there is anxiety of the deadlines if they are late and that stress is extraordinary, the current system is unsustainable.'
