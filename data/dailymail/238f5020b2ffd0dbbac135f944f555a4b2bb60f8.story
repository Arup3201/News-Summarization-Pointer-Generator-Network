Punk rocker Henry Rollins has slammed Robin Williams for killing himself - and revealed he has 'a little bit of disdain' for everyone who has taken their own life.

In a scathing column for LA Weekly that has sparked backlash online, the former Black Flag singer said he didn't understand why the comic would want to traumatize his three adult children.

'How in the hell could you possibly do that to your children?' he wrote. 'I don't care how well adjusted your kid might be - choosing to kill yourself, rather than to be there for that child, is every shade of awful, traumatic and confusing.'

He added: 'I think as soon as you have children, you waive your right to take your own life.'

No sympathy: In an opinion piece, punk rocker Henry Rollins, left, called Robin Williams selfish for killing himself and leaving his three children behind. The opinion has been slammed by fans on social media

In the piece, which also praises Williams for his acting skills and his work with the troops, Rollins said that he lost respect for people - either friends or well-known faces - after they killed themselves.

'I have many records, books and films featuring people who have taken their own lives, and I regard them all with a bit of disdain,' he wrote.

'They have nullified their existence because they willfully removed themselves from life.'

He added: 'Almost 40,000 people a year kill themselves in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In my opinion, that is 40,000 people who blew it.'

Williams, 63, had suffered from depression and addiction years before taking his life on August 11. Before his death, he had also been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Following the suicide, fans around the world mourned the loss of the comedy great, who won an Academy Award for his role in Good Will Hunting.

Unsurprisingly, some of the fans had words for Rollins after his article appeared online.

'Whatever the opposite of a "think piece" is, Henry Rollins just wrote it,' comedian Josh Weinstein wrote on Twitter.

Left behind: Williams poses with sons Cody and Zack, then-wife Marsha and daughter Zelda at a screening in 2004. In his piece, Rollins said having children meant Williams had 'waived his right to take his own life'

Attack: People took to social media to lambast the article for being judgmental and unsympathetic

Writer Patrick Verel added: 'Still kind of stunned at the lack of empathy from @henryrollins whose opinions I’ve always held in high regard.'

Rollins' opinion piece follows anger at Kiss bassist Gene Simmons for his similar lack of sympathy.

'Drug addicts and alcoholics are always, "the world is a harsh place". My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, I don't want to hear f*** all about "the world is a harsh place",' Simmons told the music site Songsfact.com.

The interview was initially published two weeks before Williams' suicide, but it spread following Williams' death, and Simmons later apologized for the remarks.
