An extraordinary email exchange demonstrates the efforts made by former Leeds owners GFH Capital in trying to prove two well-known club officials committed gross misconduct.

The messages, leaked to Sports Agenda, implicate Gulf Finance House chief Hisham Alrayes and colleague Salem Patel, a Leeds director, in attempting to find enough evidence against Shaun Harvey and Gwyn Williams to prevent them from getting a pay-off.

Harvey, now chief executive of the Football League, had his contract honoured in full when he left Leeds, but former technical director Williams started his £250,000 case for unfair dismissal this week.

Former Leeds United owners GFH sought to gather evidence that two officials committed gross misconduct

Williams was dismissed for using a club email account to send a ‘lewd and obscene’ picture to former Leeds colleague Dennis Wise. The picture of a naked woman in a shower was part of a ‘dirty Leeds’ joke email doing the rounds.

Alrayes wrote to a GFH employee at Leeds on July 23, 2013: ‘I believe we should continue to find ways to dismiss Shaun and Gwyn for gross misconduct. We should also let the investigation firm find more information on them so we can use it against them.’

Patel emailed a Leeds colleague on the same day, writing: ‘As per Hisham instruction, please can you provide a list of breaches of Gwyn and Shaun.’ Patel to Alrayes: ‘We talked through the items we have but still need specific proof for Shaun and Gwyn.’

Again from Patel to Alrayes: ‘Even still, we need to pay them as regular until we have something concrete which can prove gross misconduct. By not paying, we trigger a process which can be very damaging to the club.’

Another email between the GFH pair read: ‘Gwyn — we should pay him tomorrow otherwise we leave ourselves open for constructive dismissal and breach of contract. Before next pay date we need to find strong evidence of gross misconduct, otherwise we have to pay him as per redundancy process.

‘Shaun — we should pay him tomorrow. However if we can prove gross misconduct, we may be able to claw back some of the change of control provision. Suggest investigating all his bank accounts to see if he was receiving bribes.’

Harvey declined to comment, as did GFH.

ITV Sport, impressed with the way BT Sport cover rugby, are intending to borrow their pundits Lawrence Dallaglio, Martin Bayfield and Ben Kay for this year’s World Cup.

There are now more than five billion reasons why Premier League clubs have moved on from the sexist email exchanges last May between chief executive Richard Scudamore and DLA Piper lawyer Nick West. The TV rights package structure that proved so astonishingly lucrative was mainly devised by Scudamore and West.

Richard Scudamore secured a £5bn TV deal after selling Premier League's domestic rights to Sky and BT

Warrington Wolves owner Simon Moran is a wealthy concert promoter. Yet even the most generous estimate of Roger Draper’s salary as the rugby league club’s new chief executive means the former Lawn Tennis Association boss has taken a two-thirds pay-cut on his old £640,000 annual package.

BT ramp up Sky feud

The latest division of Premier League rights between Sky and BT Sport has done nothing to improve relations between the warring pay-TV networks. BT believe their bidding tactics resulted in Sky paying hugely over the odds for five packages, while BT got their 42 games for a sensible price. Sky claim BT put massive money on the table for the main packages but were outmanoeuvred in the second round.

Certainly the importance both sides attached to the match-pick categories — including second and third choices — in the new contract only emphasises that BT’s current deal allows Sky to dominate the selection of games to a far greater extent than BT imagined when their PL coverage started.

The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal

Iray Whelan, the English director of FIFA’s ticket and hospitality partners Match who was arrested on suspicion of ticket touting during the World Cup, has been cleared seven months later. Whelan was held in Rio’s notorious Bangu prison and labelled a fugitive. A Brazilian court ruled there were insufficient grounds to prosecute. Police had ‘erred’ in collecting evidence and worked ‘in haste’.
