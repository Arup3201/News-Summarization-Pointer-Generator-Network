A student at a private all girls' college has caused outrage and prompted attorneys to investigate after trying to set up an 'exclusive' straight-only sorority.

Drawing the most vitriol from Twitter users was her comment that she wanted to set up the club because 'I feel marginalized and I feel like the minority'.

In an email leaked onto the internet by a fellow undergraduate, the unnamed student says: 'I want to start a sorority at Smith (Delta Gamma/DG), which would basically just be an exclusive group for straight girls, a little friend group...'

She goes on to suggest that activities would include 'mixers with Amherst men, weekly dinner dates, weekly photoshoots (sic) where we would dress up nice, baking nights...'

The email message was removed after it caused fury among internet users

 However, plans for the first mixer, already organised with the Amherst basketball team according to the post, may have to be cancelled after the proposal sparked outrage.

Officials at Delta Gamma, one of the first women's fraternities, have put their attorney in contact with the $43,000-a-year school to investigate.

The fraternity, whose stated values are to 'promote educational and cultural interests, create a true sense of social responsibility, and develop the finest qualities of character', say they were not aware of the plans and will not sanction them.

Mary Ellen Hardies, the national chapter's director of communication, told USA Today: 'Our attorney has been in contact
with the university trying to figure out what the heck is going on, who
this girl is, to what extent things are happening'

She added: 'That sort of approach does not fall in 
line with our values at all.'

Twitter users also vented their frustrations, with one commenting: 'As a straight smithie I have NEVER felt marginalized by the queer community.'

'I can't fathom how you see it as a source of oppression. Being straight isn't a burden, not at smith, anywhere.'

Delta Gamma fraternity have said their attorney is now in contact with the college to find out what has been going on

The outcry was so vehement that the pupil who leaked the message took it down and apologised for the 'witch hunt' against the girl.

Smith College's Student Body President Augusta Gronquist said: 'Incidents of this type go against our understanding of what it means to be a community.'

'People in our community are hurting right now; many issues, a lot of which are unspoken or frequently ignored, have been raised and need our attention.'

Smith College was established in 1871 after Sophia Smith left a large inheritance as funding for a women's college to provide an education equal to that of men.

The U.S. News & World Report ranked Smith at 18th in 2013 among the best liberal arts colleges.

'Hello, this is [a person] and I am sending this message to girls I think might be interested in this idea and I would also love to hear your opinion on this.

'so I have this crazy idea but tell me what you honestly think. I want to start a sorority at smith (Delta Gamma/DG), which would basically just be an exclusive group for straight girls, a little friend group..

'We would have sorority mixers with Amherst men, weekly dinner dates, weekly photoshoots where we would dress up nice, baking nights..

We would also get Sorority apparel (even Lily Pulitzer has the cutest DG stuff!) and we’d have traditions, like every wednesday we wear pink haha.

'I got this idea because personally as a straight girl at Smith, I feel marginalized and I feel like the minority, and I think this could be a really great way to socialize with people we identify more with at smith, and to meet more guys..

'The first mixer is already plnned, wih the Amherst bball team this Friday (actually their idea!) What do you think?'
