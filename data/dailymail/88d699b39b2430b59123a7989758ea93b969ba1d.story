England will in April return to the scene of the 10-ball Test match for the first of 17 Tests in their most crowded ever year of international cricket.

The first of three Tests against West Indies, England’s next Test assignment after the India series, will be at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua where their match in 2009 was abandoned because of an unfit outfield.

The tour, which will also see England’s first Test in Grenada, comes during a year which will see them also playing around 30 ODIs, with the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand before the West Indies series. 

Tour: England, who are currently drawing 1-1 with India in a home series, will head to the West Indies in 2015

Safety concerns: Andrew Flintoff (centre) and Kevin Pietersen (right) look at the pitch after the Test is abandoned after just 10 balls at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua in February 2009

Effort: Groundsman work on the pitch at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Stadium in February 2009

Leader: England captain Alastair Cook will take his side on a three-match tour to the West Indies in 2015

Explosive: England will face the likes of West Indies' star man Chris Gayle during their trip to the Caribbean

April 6-7: Two-day warm-up, St Kitts

April 8-9: Two-day warm-up, St Kitts

April 13-17: First Test, Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, Antigua

April 21-25: Second Test, Grenada National Stadium, Grenada

May 1-5: Third Test, Kensington Oval, Barbados 

That means England will be playing on one of every three days during 2015, a manic schedule which will hasten burn-out and ensure fans paying high prices will not always see the best players. 

The ridiculous volume of international cricket reaches its nadir for England next year but there is no appetite among administrators, who always put money before the quality of the product, to lessen it.

Meanwhile, Trent Bridge has been given a warning by the ICC for producing a ‘poor’ pitch for the first Test against India but the ICC stopped short of fining Nottinghamshire because of the previous good quality of their pitches. 

Looking on: Then England captain Andrew Strauss looks out on the pitch after the Test is abandoned in 2009
