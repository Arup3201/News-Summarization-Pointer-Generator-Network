'Moral regression': Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç said in a speech that teenagers were becoming 'sex addicts' (file picture) 

Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister has said women should not laugh out loud in public and urged them to stop talking about 'unnecessary' things on the phone.

Bülent Arınç also complained about 'moral corruption' by television programmes which he claims are transforming teenagers from 'symbols of chastity' into 'sex addicts'.

Speaking at an Eid el-Fitr - breaking of the fast - event in the northwestern city of Bursa, he claimed Turks had 'abandoned their values' and pleaded people to rediscover the Koran.

Describing his ideal chaste man or woman, Arnic said they should both have a sense of shame and honour.

'Chastity is so important,' he said. 'It is not only a name. It is an ornament for both women and men. [She] will have chasteness. Man will have it, too. He will not be a womaniser.

'He will be bound to his wife. He will love his children. She will not laugh in public. She will not be inviting in her attitudes and will protect her chasteness,' he added.

According to the Hurriyet Daily News, he went on to condemn the transformation of young females in society.

He said: 'Where are our girls, who slightly blush, lower their heads and turn their eyes away when we look at their face, becoming the symbol of chastity?' 

Arınç also said he was frustrated by high consumption, referring to the number of cars and mobile phones that individuals now own.

Targeting women once more, Arınç said women discuss unnecessary things such as 'recipes' on the phone and should, in future, reserve these conversations for when they meet face-to-face. 

He also said people should not use their personal cars too excessively, adding that even if the River Nile  was full of oil, there would not be enough fuel to power cars.

Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, who is running for the president against Arınç’s boss, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan, commented on Arınç’s statement via Twitter, saying Turkey needed women to laugh because of a need to hear their happiness. 

Mr Arınç is a member of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) which conservative values leading to it being described as Islamist.

Turkey has historically been more progressive with women’s rights than neighbouring countries but problems concerning honour killings and domestic violence have prompted concern. 

Tayyip Erdogan said he is 'glad' to give money back

The Turkish Prime Minister has said he is happy to return a reward he received from the American-Jewish Congress in 2004 for helping to broker peace between Israel and Palestine, after they labelled him the world's most 'virulent anti-Israeli leader'.

Last week the New York-based organisation condemned Tayyip Erdogan after he suggested Israel had 'surpassed Hitler in barbarism' through its attacks on Gaza.

As a result, officials from the group demanded that he return money they handed to him for his efforts to improve relations between the countries a decade ago. 

According to World Bulletin, an open letter from Turkey's ambassador to Washington, Serdar Killic, to American Jewish Congress President, Jack Rosen, stated Mr Erdogan would be 'glad' to give the money back.

It read: 'The absence of this award will not prevent Prime Minister Erdogan from resolutely fighting against terrorism, working towards the peaceful solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and upholding the safety and well-being of the Jewish community in Turkey.'

'Instead of acting according to the requirements of international law, Israel continues its occupation and destruction policies ... (and) attempts to depict Prime Minister Erdogan's legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government's attacks on civilians as expressions of anti-Semitism is an obvious distortion and an effort to cover up the historical wrongdoings of the Israeli government,' it continued.

'We would like to urge you to publicly condemn the Israeli government's policies that have caused public outrage around the world.'
