State school students with straight A grades are less likely to win places at Oxford University than privately educated pupils, it has emerged.

Applicants from fee-paying schools with top grades were around 25 per cent more likely to get into the world-famous seat of learning than academic candidates from elsewhere.

The figures released under the Freedom of Information act will come as a disappointment after the Government put pressure on top universities to ensure they took in students from a range of backgrounds.

Of 5,300 applicants with three A grades at AS level who applied to Oxford last year, 29 per cent of those who were privately educated got a place.

Only 23 per cent of those with the same grades from state schools were accepted, however, according to figures seen by the Daily Telegraph.

Among the 3,888 white pupils with A grades who applied last year, 28 per cent were offered places, but just 20 per cent of black African students got in - 13 of 67.

Students from Chinese, Indian or other Asian backgrounds had a similar acceptance rate, and only five per cent of Bangladeshi and Pakistani students gained admission.

Last month, prospective law student Elly
Nowell sent a mocking 'rejection letter' to Magdalen College, saying 
the university did not meet the standards she expected.

Magdalen was at the centre of a row in 2000, when academics refused a place to Laura Spence, a former comprehensive pupil with five As at A level, in what Gordon Brown called 'an absolute disgrace.'

Last year, Nick Clegg accused Oxford and Cambridge of being effectively biased against poor pupils, saying they had to ensure 'British society is better reflected' in their admissions to justify state funding.

But the university insisted that white pupils were more than twice as likely as black pupils to gain three A grades at A-level and pointed out that privately educated teenagers account for a third of those gaining straight As, despite making up just 14 per cent of entries.

A spokeswoman said: 'Two candidates from different school backgrounds who have performed the same in all aspects of the selection system would have the same chance of getting a place, regardless of their school.

'Selection is not based solely on A-level results. Two people with same A-level results will have different GCSE results, perform differently on pre-interview aptitude tests, and show different potential in interview.'
