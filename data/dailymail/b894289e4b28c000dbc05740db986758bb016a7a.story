Sick of your cup of joe leaving a nasty stain on your surfaces? Then this could be the mug do for you.

Designer Kim Keun Ae has created a coffee mug with an ingenious twist that makes you wonder why it hasn’t been invented before.

The Drop Rest Cup is a simple, but innovative solution to that age old problem of how to stop drips of coffee creating a stain on your furniture or newspaper.

The genius of the design is that while it looks like a simple white mug, it features an indented ring towards the bottom of the cup and a gap which catches those slows drips.

Capitalizing on the physics of surface tension, a thin groove keeps small, nuisance droplets in place so there’s no need to worry about coffee stains, reports Yanko Design.

Unfortunately the design is currently a 'work in progress' and there is no date for when it will be available to purchase.
