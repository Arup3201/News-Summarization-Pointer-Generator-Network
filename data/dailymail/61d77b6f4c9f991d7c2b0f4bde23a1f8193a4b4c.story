Wait: Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos was due to hear the verdict today on her assault charge but will now have to wait until at least July 2

Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos must wait more than a month to discover the outcome of her trial over claims she assaulted a celebrity blogger.

The singer arrived at court today to hear the verdict on claims she left writer Savvas Morgan with a swollen eye.

But following a legal argument, District Judge Angus adjourned the case so that further witnesses can be called.

One of the outstanding issues surrounds the existence of a 'lost' photograph of Mr Morgan’s injuries allegedly inflicted by the ex-N-Dubz singer at V-Festival in Essex last August.

There will now be no verdict until at least July 2 when the case will resume.

Judge Hamilton said: 'I am anxious this does not go on any longer than necessary.'

During the trial, Contostavlos, who pleaded not guilty to assault, said she was disappointed 'a playground slanging match' had reached court and was keen for it to be resolved adding: 'This is my life on the line.'

She has claimed she did not attack him and has been the 
victim of a vendetta, saying Mr Morgan had a 'strange obsession' with 
her.

The star is on trial at Chelmsford 
Magistrates’ Court with her assistant, Gareth Varey, who is accused of 
threatening behaviour, which he also denies.

Earlier today Contostavlos’ tour manager, Drew Lyall, said he had put an arm around her after witnessing the aftermath of the incident which happened in a backstage area.

Mr Lyall, who told the court he had assisted Contostavlos on hundreds of occasions, added: 'She was very upset and briefly mentioned it was a guy who had been hounding her or harassing her for a very long period.

'She hadn’t mentioned any particular individual before the incident, I had never seen him before.

'She was calm. She was just a little bit upset.'

Other
 celebrities, including singer and rapper Misha B, Sugababes singer 
Mutya Buena, singer Alexandra Burke and rapper Wretch 32, all witnessed 
the incident but have not given evidence.

Contostavlos
 told the court that Mr Morgan had conducted a 'vendetta' against her 
since an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP 
area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair.

She also outlined her suspicions that Mr Morgan was involved in the release of a sex tape of her online.

But she claimed she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.'

Mr Morgan told the court that Contostavlos raised her fists in the air and was swinging her arms in a backstage area at the festival.

'Everyone was jumping around trying to get at me, there was a lot going on,' he said.

Prosecutor Matthew McNiff said the incident happened at 12.30am on August 18 as Mr Morgan was about to leave. He said Contostavlos accused Mr Morgan of stalking her, and swore at him.

Contostavlos and Varey, 28, both of Royal Drive, Friern Barnet, north London, are both on unconditional bail.
