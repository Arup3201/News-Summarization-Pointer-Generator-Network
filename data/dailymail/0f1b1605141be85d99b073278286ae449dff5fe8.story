A section of the Great Wall of China has been set aside for graffiti in a bid to save other parts being vandalised by tourists.

Authorities chose a popular stretch of the ancient monument where visitors can scrawl their names in the hope it will stop the spread of graffiti.

Most of the graffiti is written in English, with phrases like 'I was 'ere' and notices saying who to call 'for a good time' common.

A part of the Mutianyu section (pictured here) of the Great Wall of China has been chosen as a spot for tourists to scrawl graffiti

A spot on the Mutianyu section in Huairou County, about 43 miles north-east of Beijing, was chosen. It is one of the most popular tourist spots along the wall.

The graffiti section will be set up at one of the fighting towers that 
has become a common place there for tourists to scrawl on the walls.

It attracts millions of tourists per year, 40 per cent of whom are estimated to be foreigners, which explains why most of the graffiti is in English.

Graffiti has long been a problem with Chinese scenic sites, and has sparked innovative responses from authorities.

Officials in Wuhan set up touch-screen graffiti platforms to keep visitors from carving their initials into a local pagoda.

The
 minders of the Great Wall are reportedly also considering 'an 
electronic graffiti board,' to hopefully cut down on permanent 
desecration of the site.

The original Great Wall dates back to seventh century China, but the section in Zhangjiakou was rebuilt more than 500 years ago in 1484 during the Ming Dynasty.

The wall has been constantly rebuilt and repaired throughout history. An expert said: 'Like any building project, some work lasts longer than others.'

Still one of the only man made objects visible from space, the wall is made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials. 

Chinese authorities have been trying to find new ways to tackle the problem of graffiti on the Great Wall of China. Pictured here is the Mutianyu near Beijing

Sections
 of the Wall north of Beijing and near tourist centres, such as Mutianyu, have been 
preserved and even extensively renovated but in many locations the Wall 
is in disrepair.

In 
poorer parts of the country the Wall is sometimes used as a village 
playground or is used as a source of stones for rebuilding houses and 
roads.

Sections have also been affected by graffiti and vandalism. Other parts have been destroyed to make way for construction.

More than 37 miles in the Gansu province may disappear in the next two decades, due to erosion from sandstorms.

In parts, the height of the wall has been reduced from more than 16ft to less than six feet.

The iconic square-shaped lookout towers that form the most famous images of the wall have disappeared completely.

Many
 western sections of the wall are constructed from mud, rather than 
brick and stone, and are therefore more susceptible to erosion.

It was built along an east-to-west 
line across the historical northern borders of China in part to protect 
the Chinese Empire against attack by various nomadic groups or military 
incursions by various warlike peoples or forces.

In
 addition to acting as a shield against border enemies the Great Wall 
was also used to enforce duties on goods transported along the Silk 
Road, to regulate or encourage trade and control immigration and 
emigration.

Troop 
barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through smoke or 
fire also helped to enhance the walls defensive characteristics.

The
 Wall goes from Shanhaiguan in the east, to Lop Lake in the west, an 
area that loosely represents the southern edge of Inner Mongolia. The 
entire length, which includes trenches and natural barriers such as 
hills and rivers, stretches to 5,500 miles.

Although other experts have concluded that if branches of the wall are included its entire length is around 14,000 miles.

The
 first wall construction is thought to date from the 7th century BC. 
Especially famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first 
Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang.

Little
 of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been 
rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall was
 reconstructed during the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century.
