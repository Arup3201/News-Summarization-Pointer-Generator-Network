Oscar got a surprise visit from one of his Chelsea team-mates at his book signing at the club’s Cobham training ground.

At the ripe old age of 23, the Brazilian midfielder has released his memoir ‘Oscar’s Brazil’ and was signing copies at Chelsea’s club shop on Friday.

Little did Oscar know that his team-mate Branislav Ivanovic was waiting in the queue at the club’s megastore to get his copy signed by the new author. 

Oscar was unaware that Branislav Ivanovic was waiting in line at his book signing in the Chelsea club shop 

The Serbian defender asks Oscar to sign his copy much to the amusement of the Brazilian midfielder 

Ivanovic takes the opportunity to grab a quick selfie with his Chelsea team-mate 

The duo are both in the Chelsea squad for Sunday's clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford 

The tough Serbian defender waited patiently in line before meeting Oscar and even grabbed an impromptu selfie with his team-mate. 

The duo are both in Jose Mourinho's squad for the Sunday's clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford. 

Chelsea are currently unbeaten in the Premier League and currently lead second-placed Manchester City, who lost 2-1 to West Ham on Saturday, by five points.
