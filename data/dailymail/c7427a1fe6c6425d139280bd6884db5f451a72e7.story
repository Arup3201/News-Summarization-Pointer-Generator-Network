Olympus is to release a pair of 'techno-glasses' that put a computer display directly in front of your eyes - and can also make the world itself look cheerier by turning up the brightness.

The MEG4.0 glasses work with a see-through display called a 'pupil division optical system', and displays information such as emails from a smartphone linked to the glasses via Bluetooth.

Olympus is the latest tech giant to throw its weight behind 'techno-glasses' - both Apple and Google are now investigating the technology.

Olympus's glasses link to a smartphone via Bluetooth to display information such as emails - they also have built-in GPS and an accelerometer to deliver mapping information

Olympus's glasses - at the prototype stage at present - are lightweight, battery-powered and last for a reported eight hours.

The glasses have a GPS system and accelerometer built in, which could be used to deliver information about the local area direct to their 320x240 display.

Tech site The Register said that momentum is gathering behind the idea of 'wearable computers.'

'With Olympus, Google and Apple involved in the area you can bet your last dollar other companies are looking into it too,' said the site's Chris Mellor.

Apple filed a patent referring to, 'Methods 
and apparatus, including computer program products, implementing and 
using techniques for projecting a source image in a head-mounted display
apparatus for a user.'

Google's glasses are designed to let users
capture video with a built-in camera as well as use apps, the internet,
and social networking sites on the move. 

A small projector displays an image in front of the wearer's eyes while letting them stay aware on the outside world. 

Experience:
Google has already released a sneak-peak at the user-interface for the 
Glass, which broadcasts data directly in front of the eye, bypassing 
cell phones

The demonstration shows off a weather forecast layered over a view of the world

The demonstration shows off navigation information similar to what Google currently offers via its Maps service

The idea is to bypass computers, tablets and smartphones entirely and keep the user connected in a (fairly) discreet way.

With the glasses, directions to your 
destination or a text message from a friend can appear literally before 
your eyes.
