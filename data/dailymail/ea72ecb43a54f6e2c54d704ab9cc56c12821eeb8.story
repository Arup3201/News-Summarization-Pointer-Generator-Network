A Minnesota woman had promised her aunt to watch her 6-year-old daughter while the woman was recovering from an injury, but instead she took off, leaving the girl to freeze to death outside, according to newly released charging documents.

Rachel Stacey Downer appeared in court in Beltrami County on a second-degree manslaughter charge and was released on $100,000 bond. She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Downer's cousin, 6-year-old Mercedes Mayfield, was found curled up on the front step of a Bemidji apartment building early February 27.

Tragic end: The little girl, pictured here with her cousin, was found frozen to death outside an apartment building in Minnesota

The child's mother, Malika Peoples, called 911 at around 6.30am to report her daughter was stiff, frozen and unresponsive.

The
 girl was dressed in a winter coat and hat, with a boot on her left 
foot. Her right boot and her mittens were found on an outside step.

Temperatures that night dipped down to 19 degrees below zero, with a wind chill of 32 below, the criminal complaint cited by Minneapolis Star Tribune said.

The
 last time Mercedes was seen alive was the evening before. Downer was 
going to take her cousin to her apartment to baby-sit her that night, 
but changed her mind and didn't tell Mercedes' mother, according to the 
complaint.

Mercedes helped 
Downer carry her things to her car. Downer said she watched the girl 
enter the building, then got in her car and drove off.

Miss Downer told police Mercedes had shut the apartment's safety door gently, so it would not lock her out.

It has not been revealed how many hours the first-grader spent outdoors from the time Downer took off and until she was found lying unconscious.

Misunderstanding: Downer was supposed to take her cousin to her apartment, but at the last minute changed her mind without telling the girl's mother

Left to die: Downer told police Mercedes helped carry her things to her car, and the 22-year-old then watched the enter the building before driving off

According
 to the complaint, Downer was supposed to be watching Mercedes and a 
3-year-old sibling, as well as Downer's own 2-year-old son, while 
Peoples was at work.

Peoples told police that she hurt her arm at work and took pain medication to help her sleep while Downer watched the children.

The
 family ate dinner together, then Peoples turned in early. When she was awakened by her alarm clock at 6am, neither Downer nor Mercedes were in the apartment.

‘Ms.
 Peoples said that she then called Downer and asked her why she had 
taken Mercedes home with her when she knew Mercedes had school,’ the 
complaint said. ‘Ms. Peoples said that she then looked out her front 
window and saw her daughter lying on the front step.

‘She then went outside and pulled her into the entryway and called 911.’

Rescue
 workers tried to revive Mercedes, but she was pronounced dead at the 
scene. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office reported that she 
died from hypothermia due to exposure to the freezing cold.

Downer is due back in court March 24. She has been barred from making contact with the victim’s family.

Following her release from jail, the 22-year-old suspect briefly addressed the incident in an interview with KAAL-TV.

‘I'm
 hurt right now. I'm going through a tough time right now, it's like my 
whole life has been taken away from me because of this,’ she said.

Online tributes: On the day of Mercedes' death, Downer uploaded more than a half-dozen collages depicting her late 6-year-old cousin

Family torn apart: Mercedes is said to have two younger siblings, a brother and sister

On the day of Mercedes' death, the 22-year-old woman took to Facebook, posting more than a half-dozen collages depicting little Mercedes, accompanied by the status update: 'R I.P Gone but never forgotten.' 

The 6-year-old had just enrolled in first grade at Horace May Elementary within the past few days, having transferred from J.W. Smith Elementary, where she attended kindergarten and part of this school year.

Bemidji is also only about 115 miles 
south of International Falls, Minnesota, a Canadian border town known as
 the ‘icebox of the nation’ because it often has the coldest 
temperatures in the lower 48 states.
