Portable EEG headsets allow companies to analyse, second by second, which adverts are causing viewers to feel pleasure

Many of us scoff 'adverts don't work on me' - even when that John Lewis one can reduce us to tears.

But this year, a British company is to monitor the effects of advertising in a more detailed way than ever before - using EEG brain monitors to 'watch' the pleasure centres of viewers as they sit through Britain's most expensive advertising slots in the X Factor final.

Viewers will watch the ad breaks wearing an EEG headset - rather like a swimming cap, but monitoring brain waves, particularly in the brain's pleasure centres.

The company, SimpleUsability, will also use eye-tracking monitors to work out which advert is most effective.

Such 'neuromarketing' monitoring techniques are an extremely new idea - and headsets portable enough to use them are very new indeed.

Advertising slots in the slot before the X Factor results are announced cost £8,000 per second - so advertisers use high technology to ensure their adverts are 'working' on the audience

Such tools are becoming essential for television advertising companies to compete with the 'accountability' of internet advertising, where advertisers can see immediately whether their audience have clicked.

American television company Nielsen, which pioneered much of the monitoring technology we take for granted today, is now testing EEG headsets as a way of monitoring audience reaction.

Neurosense, a division of Nielsen, says, 'Our innovative neurological research, combined with The Nielsen Company’s deep expertise on what consumers watch and buy, will provide unmatched knowledge.'

Typically, television adverts use much lower tech methods such as surveys conducted after the event.

Advances in electro-encephalography have allowed scientists to scan the brain in a huge amount more detail.

The fact that data can be stored and analysed against the running time of the video can pinpoint moments in an advert that 'work' in terms of delivering pleasure.

Combined with an eye-tracker, it allows advertisers to 'design' - or re-cut - adverts to work better.

'The break before the winner is announced on Sunday, December 11th’s live final is the most expensive in the UK with slots selling for £8k per second,' says the research company SimpleUsability.

'By using innovative testing technologies that track eye movement and monitor subliminal, emotional responses, we will be recording how each advert rates in terms of excitement, interest and, emotional engagement amongst X Factor viewers.'

The company will announce which advert has been most 'effective' just after the competition.
