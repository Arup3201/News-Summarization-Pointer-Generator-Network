Norwich City have issued three supporters with final warnings following complaints of homophobic abuse at Carrow Road.

The trio have been warned after the Canaries completed an investigation into abuse flagged up by fellow Norwich supporters at more than one home match earlier this season.

One of those incidents is known to have occurred at half-time in the 2-2 draw with Birmingham on September 20, while the Championship side also revealed that another case is being examined.
