Dr Phil’s wife Robin McGraw has admitted that friends find it strange that she never argues with her husband.

The mother-of-two, 61, who has been married to the TV star for 37 years told New You magazine: ‘People cannot understand when we say we don’t fight.  They go “that’s just not natural, you’re lying! Couples fight.”  

‘But we don’t fight and it’s because we had a conversation early on and I told him that it’s not natural for me to be in a house where people are screaming and yelling – my parents didn’t do it, I don’t do it and I don’t want to live in a house like that.  He got it and has never raised his voice around me. We don't fight.’

Perfect couple: Robin McGraw, the wife of Dr Phil, says that the two have maintained a 37 year bond by never fighting and always flirting

Deep thoughts: Mrs McGraw has also opened up about what it was like to grow up with an alcoholic father, saying that it was an incredibly difficult experience

Mrs McGraw - whose New You feature 
marks her first magazine cover - added that she keeps the spark alive by
 flirting with Dr Phil.

‘Always
 flirt!’ she said. ‘A piece of advice I’d tell women:  Learn what your 
husband considers flirting and learn what makes your husband happy.’

The interview also saw her speak about what it was like to grow up with an alcoholic father.

She
 said of her childhood: ‘I lived in uncertainty every day because of it 
and didn’t like the feeling. I made decisions early on that I was going 
to do everything I could to be in control of myself and my life.’

She added that the experience ‘taught me compassion and how to have a more accepting and loving spirit.’

The
 couple have two sons, Jay, 34 and Jordan, 28. Jay and wife Erica have 
also given them two grandchildren – a four-year-old girl named Avery and
 grandson London, three.

But
 despite her growing career and duties as a mother and grandmother, Mrs 
McGraw says that her husband ‘is my number one priority.’

She
 advises other women looking to balance work and family life to ask 
their husbands: ‘”What can I do for you? Tell me what you need from me, 
what you need to hear from me, what you need to see me do. I’ll do it.”’

She
 also recommends checking in with one’s husband on a ‘regular basis,’ 
adding: ‘Phillip always needs to know I’m proud of him and the loves to 
hear that I appreciate him.’

Number one: Mrs McGraw says that even after having kids and a career, her husband was her first priority

Even
 when she gave birth to Jay in 1979, Mrs McGraw sat Phillip down to tell
 him that he would still be a priority for her, even with a child in the
 house.

She explains: ‘From 
that moment on, he could say to himself, “Oh good, I’m not going to be 
in second place. She’s not going to forget about our relationship.”’

Mrs McGraw has recently launched a range of anti-aging skincare called Robin McGraw Revelation.

She has also launched a foundation called When Georgia Smiled, which helps victims of domestic violence.
