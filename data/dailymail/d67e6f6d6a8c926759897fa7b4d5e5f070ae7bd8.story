The former deputy leader of the shamed Labour council that failed to protect generations of children from sexual abuse last night flatly refused to apologise to the victims.

There was growing outrage over the failures by Rotherham council, which turned a blind eye while Pakistani grooming gangs sexually preyed on an estimated 2,000 girls.

As it emerged that a string of those responsible have gone on to lucrative jobs at other councils – some in charge of safeguarding children – the Labour former deputy council leader Jahangir Akhtar was asked if he wanted to apologise to the victims of sexual abuse.

In response, he shouted: ‘Absolutely not – go away.’ He refused to open the front door of his £150,000 detached home near the centre of Rotherham.

Mr Akhtar, 54, who has previously been pictured standing shoulder to shoulder with Labour leader Ed Miliband, was forced to ‘step aside’ from his role as deputy leader following allegations that he had been involved in a deal to help a relative accused of grooming an underage girl. He then lost his seat to Ukip at last year’s local elections.

Meanwhile, Shaun Wright – head of children’s services at Rotherham council from 2005 to 2010 who was forced to quit as South Yorkshire police commissioner after fierce criticism of his role – yelled abuse when questioned about the report by a reporter.

At his luxury five-bedroom house on an exclusive executive estate outside Rotherham, Mr Wright, 46, told the reporter: ‘I’m not in the public domain any more – you have no right. Just get off my property. I’m not talking!’

The council’s former leader, Roger Stone, who like Mr Wright refused to co-operate with an inspection into the affair which this week branded the authority ‘in denial’, was not at his home and failed to respond to telephone messages.

Rotherham councillors are facing criminal charges after a shocking report laid bare how they tried to cover up one of Britain’s biggest child abuse scandals.

Up to 2,000 girls were sexually exploited by Pakistani gangs in Rotherham while they ignored – and in some cases covered up – the abuse over a 16-year period due to an obsession with political correctness.

After the entire council cabinet was forced to resign, the Prime Minister said yesterday that the same phenomenon was occuring across the country.

On a trip to Leeds, David Cameron promised that extra resources would be provided to Rotherham council if needed.

But he added: ‘Let’s not pretend this is a problem of money. It was mismanagement, political correctness, sexism. This is not a failure of resources, it was a failure of leadership. We need to tackle this across other parts of the country too.’

Mr Akhtar has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls

Incredibly, despite the scandal, many of those responsible for the shocking failures at the Labour-run council have walked into highly paid roles elsewhere.

The council’s former chief executive Ged Fitzgerald – accused of allowing one report warning of child sex grooming to be suppressed and another ignored – is now earning £199,500 a year as chief executive of Liverpool City Council. Jackie Wilson – who was responsible for safeguarding children in Rotherham during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished – now earns £90,000-a-year as assistant director for children and families in the neighbouring town of Doncaster.

Former deputy council leader Mr Akhtar – described in the report as a ‘powerful figure’ in the town with ‘influence that extended to the police’ – is a former taxi driver with a criminal conviction for his role in a violent brawl.

He came in for sustained criticism in this week’s scathing report by government adviser Louise Casey, which recorded how ‘members, officers and others spoke about him with a level of fear’.

‘Some were concerned when speaking to inspectors that what they said would get back to him,’ it said, even though he was no longer on the council.

He has been connected to numerous aspects of the scandal that led to the council failing to identify and act on the abuse of girls.

His cousin, Arshad Hussain, was named as a ‘boyfriend’ by up to 18 girls who spoke to social workers as part of the Risky Business outreach group, aimed at youngsters who were at risk of being lured into prostitution.

The married father-of-five was accused in a report in The Times last year of helping to arrange a deal where Hussain returned one of his young alleged victims who had gone missing from home to police.

Joyce Thacker: Mrs Thacker earned £115,000 a year as strategic director of children and young people’s services at Rotherham.

She was deputy director from 2006, taking over the top post in 2008 and holding it until last year. In that time hundreds of children are now known to have been targeted by Pakistani grooming gangs. But the scandals on her watch did not prevent her from being handed a £40,000 pay-off when she resigned last year.

Dr Sonia Sharp: Dr Sharp was Mrs Thacker’s immediate predecessor as strategic director of children and young people’s services from 2005 to 2008, when shocking sexual abuse was rampant and the ethnic dimension of the abuse covered up.

Since leaving, she has advised officials in Malaysia responsible for child protection on ‘best practice’. She now works in Australia in education.

Ged Fitzgerald: He was the chief executive from 2001 to 2003 and was accused of allowing one report warning of child sex grooming to be suppressed and another ignored. The 53-year-old is now the £199,500 a year chief executive of Liverpool City Council.

Jackie Wilson: She was a senior manager with responsibility for safeguarding children in Rotherham during the years when widespread sex grooming crimes were going unpunished. But today as the £90,000-a-year assistant director for children and families at the council in nearby Donaster, Mrs Wilson is again entrusted with the safety of young people.

Martin Kimber: The £160,000-a-year chief executive from 2009 to 2014 refused to sack a single senior officer at Rotherham, despite damning evidence of failure and incompetence. Last September he was handed a £26,000 pay-off to go two months early. 

Police are investigating claims that a report detailing the child sex abuse in Rotherham was stolen as part of a council cover-up.

The theft is alleged to have been part of a conspiracy orchestrated by council insiders desperate to conceal the scale of the problem of sexual grooming gangs in the town.

The stolen file was reported by a Home Office researcher working with Rotherham Council’s youth service in 2002. She claimed senior managers at the authority were ‘indifferent’ when she told them she believed as many as 270 girls were being groomed for sex.

But after sending a draft version of her report detailing the abuse to the council and Home Office on a Friday, she returned to her office the following Monday to find all the files had gone and computer records wiped.

Significantly, there were no signs of a break-in, and the door had been locked and key-coded – meaning only a limited number of council workers would have had access.

Professor Alexis Jay revealed details of a possible break-in in her report last year

The extraordinary raid from within the council’s offices is likely to form part of a criminal probe into an alleged attempt to cover up the scale of child sexual abuse by members of the town’s Pakistani community, which could see councillors and council officers facing the threat of jail.

The Home Office worker behind the report was allegedly later suspended for supposedly including confidential data in her report, then ordered to water it down after being reinstated. She refused to change a word.

Incredibly, the report was never published, and it would be more than a decade later before the truth was finally acknowledged.

It is thought that if it had been published it could have potentially prevented the abuse of hundreds of girls over the years that followed.

Details of the break-in were first raised following last August’s report by Professor Alexis Jay, which stated that the researcher’s draft report contained ‘severe criticisms of the agencies in Rotherham involved with child sexual exploitation’ but that she had been subjected to ‘personalised hostility at the hands of officials’.

She concluded: ‘Had this report been treated with the seriousness it merited at the time, by both the police and the council, the children involved then and later would have been better protected and abusers brought to justice. These events have led to suspicions of collusion and cover-up.’

The unnamed researcher subsequently gave evidence to a private session of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

In their report of the meeting, MPs revealed the researcher had handed police the names of five people who had access to the room where her missing files had been kept, but they failed to act on the information. When asked why not, David Crompton, current chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, told MPs his officers ‘could not find’ any police reports about the documents being removed.

At the time, committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up.’

The researcher had been based within Risky Business, the council’s specialist youth service, which is praised in both the Jay report and this week’s damning inspection by Louise Casey for being the only part of the authority to help vulnerable teenage girls, only to be effectively closed down for flagging up ‘uncomfortable truths’.

Yesterday the council said it had set up an external review to ‘establish the facts of the matter’. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the Home Office was ‘looking at the files to ascertain exactly what happened’.
