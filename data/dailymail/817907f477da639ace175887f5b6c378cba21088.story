Barack Obama's controversial Israel policy was today blamed for a stunning Republican election victory in a Democrat stronghold which is 40% Jewish.

In a devastating turnaround, Bob Turner last night became the first Republican to win New York's ninth congressional district since 1920.

A special election was held in New York 
City for Anthony Weiner's seat after he was forced to quit over Twitter 
'sexting' in June.

Experts say the loss was New York giving President Barack Obama a bloody nose.

Mr Turner, a retired media executive who called the election a repudiation of Mr Obama, won by six points - 
53 per cent to 47 per cent.

This is despite Democrats outnumbering 
Republicans in the area by three to one, a ratio that should have 
assured a win for candidate David Weprin.

According to the New York Times, Turner 
took advantage of discontent among the Jewish community with Obamaâ€™s
 policy toward Israel and the Middle East peace process.

Mr Obama has been seen as taking a hard line stance towards Israel, opposing settlement building and putting pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during peace talks.

In doing so he has faced heavy criticism and accusations from the Jewish community that he is appeasing Arab countries in order to change the regional balance of power.

Former Mayor Ed Koch, a Democrat, endorsed Turner in July as a way to 'send a message' to Obama on his policies toward Israel.

And Weprin was challenged on his support of a proposed Islamic center and mosque near the World Trade Center site, in lower Manhattan.

The victory is a further set back for Mr Obama who is facing dwindling support as he begins his campaign for re-election next year.

The president, who has seen his approval ratings plunge to 44 per cent, is trying to shore up confidence in his leadership which has been battered by the economic crisis.

Last week, he unveiled a $450billion package of tax cuts and spending plans aimed at creating jobs and encouraging growth.

The election result came as a new 
poll showed Mr Obama's approval rating has fallen below 50 per cent in 
California, a state assumed to be an easy win for him next year.

He carried California in the 2008 
election but Field Poll findings show people there disapprove of his 
handling of the economy and just 46 per cent now say they support his 
performance as president.

It
 is the first time since Mr Obama took office that his approval rating 
has slipped below 50 per cent in the poll and it has fallen down 8 per 
cent since June.

After winning, Mr Turner said: 'We've
 been asked by the people of this district to send a message to 
Washington and I hope they hear it loud and clear. We're ready to say 
"Mr President, we are on the wrong track."'

He
 said he had entered politics because he was 'fed up' with overspending 
in Washington and has called for deep cuts in the federal budget.

Mr
 Weprin's attempt to portray his opponent as part of the Tea Party, which 
wants smaller government and lower taxes and is unpopular with many 
liberal New Yorkers, failed.

He
 had raised $500,000 for his campaign compared to Mr Turner's $200,000 
and in recent days former president Bill Clinton was among those urging 
Democrats to turn out.

The
 Republicans also won in another special election in Nevada, taking the 
Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 242-192.

Scandal: The then Congressman Weiner sent explicit pictures of himself on Twitter.

Steve Israel, chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, issued a statement playing 
down the importance of Turner's victory.

'The
 results ... are not reflective of what will happen in November 2012 
when Democratic challengers run against Republican incumbents who voted 
to end Medicare and cut Social Security while protecting tax loopholes 
for big corporations and the ultra wealthy,' he said

Mr
 Weiner, who had been in Congress for seven years, resigned in June 
after sending sexually provocative messages to women he contacted 
online.

He had 
initially denied the photograph was of him but later admitted it was and
 apologised for 'the embarrassment that I have caused'.

The
 politician was a Democratic firebrand known for passionate speeches in 
support of healthcare reform and other issues dear to liberals.

His wife Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, stood by him despite the scandal and is six-months pregnant with a baby boy.

Mr Webrin spend time on an 'intense' rehab programme to help treat his 'sexting' addiction after the scandal broke.
