Is this the summer when 48 years of World Cup hurt for England will finally end? The omens are certainly looking good.

Roy Hodgson's side travel to Brazil looking to win the competition for the first time since 1966 when Bobby Moore lifted the trophy at Wembley - and their chances may have been boosted by this quartet of omens.

The first good sign for England came earlier this month when Austria won the Eurovision Song Competition for the first time since 1966 thanks to drag queen Conchita Wurst.

Up for the cup: Conchita Wurst won the Eurovision Song Contest for Austria in Copenhagen this year

Euro glory: Real Madrid duo Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas lift the Champions League trophy

Parade: Atletico Madrid players and supporters celebrate after the club won their tenth La Liga title

Party time: Arsenal celebrate with the FA Cup after coming back from 2-0 down to beat Hull City 3-2

Then a 1-1 draw
 for Atletico Madrid at Barcelona on the final day of the season was 
enough for Diego Simeone's side to claim the La Liga title, which they 
also won in 1966.

That
 same year was also the last time a team came back from 2-0 down to win 
3-2 in the FA Cup final when Everton beat Sheffield Wednesday, before 
Arsenal achieved that particular feat against Hull City at Wembley on May 17.

And
 if that wasn't enough, Real Madrid won the Champions League in Lisbon 
on Saturday to repeat their European Cup success of 1966 when they beat 
Partizan 2-1 in Brussels.
