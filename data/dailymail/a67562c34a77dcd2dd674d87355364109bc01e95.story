As if Facebook, Google and the federal government squirreling away your personal information wasn't enough, now it seems your car could also be spying on you.

According to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, several major automakers and GPS manufacturers have been collecting data about drivers' whereabouts gathered from on-board navigation systems and keeping the information for varying lengths of time.

The report was released on Monday. It focused on the big three Detroit automakers, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, as well as GPS manufacturers Garmin and TomTom, and app developers Google Maps and Telenav.

The GAO - as well as Senator Al Franken, who requested the investigation - worries that the privacy of motorists is at risk if information about their travels are being recorded without their knowledge, and kept for indefinite amounts of time.

According to the report, even if a motorist wants data about their travel destroyed, the entity collecting the data isn't required to destroy it.

According to the report, the companies can 'track where consumers are, which can in turn be used to steal their 
identity, stalk them or monitor them without their knowledge. In 
addition, location data can be used to infer other sensitive information
 about individuals such as their religious affiliation or political 
activities.'

Franken, of Minnesota, chairs the judiciary committee on privacy, and has introduced location privacy legislation into the Senate. He now says he plans to reintroduce amended legislation following the GSO's report.

'Modern technology now allows drivers to get turn-by-turn directions in a matter of seconds, but our privacy laws haven’t kept pace with these enormous advances,' Franken said in a statement. 'Companies providing in-car location services are taking their customers’ privacy seriously — but this report shows that Minnesotans and people across the country need much more information about how the data are being collected, what they’re being used for, and how they’re being shared with third parties.'

The Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, the trade organization that represents Detroit's 'Big Three' automakers, claims that the car companies are committed to ensuring the privacy of drivers, despite the report's findings.

'Details of the industry’s strict privacy policies are traditionally included in our sales and service agreements,' spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist told The Detroit News. 'That way, we ensure our customers have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with these strict privacy policies.'

The report also found that vehicles can collect information in other ways, including the use of event data recorders, or 'black boxes,' or other transponders like EZ-PASS.

The GSO also says that law enforcement officials will sometimes use information gathered from these sources, and that some car owners agree to have their driving habits monitored to qualify for lower insurance rates, or to keep tabs on teenage motorists.

'Companies should safeguard location data, in part, by de-identifying them; that companies should not keep location data longer than needed; and that such data should be deleted after a specific amount of time,' the report concluded, noting that none of the companies would say how long they keep data.

'OnStar takes seriously matters that affect our customers’ privacy and operates its services with strong privacy protections and practices,' General Motors said in a statement.
