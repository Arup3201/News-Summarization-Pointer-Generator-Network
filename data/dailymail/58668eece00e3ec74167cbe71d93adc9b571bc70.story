The partner of an NYPD rookie cop who shot dead an unarmed black man in the stairwell of an apartment block has been given immunity for testifying against his fellow officer.

Officer Peter Liang pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to  manslaughter, official misconduct and other charges in the shooting death of 28-year-old Akai Gurley in Brooklyn last November.

Liang, 27, was able to be charged so heftily in part because of the grand-jury testimony of his partner, Officer Shaun Landau, police sources to The New York Post. 

The rookie cop faces more than 15 years in prison if he is found guilty.

On November 20, Liang and Landau were patrolling the Louis Pink Houses, a gritty public housing complex in East New York where reports of violent crime had spiked.

The hallways were pitch-black, prompting the officers to use flashlights. Liang, for unclear reasons, had his gun drawn and his finger on the trigger.

At the same time, Mr Gurley, who has a two-year-old daughter, was waiting for an elevator with a female companion, Melissa Butler.

When it didn't come, he stepped into the hallway to take the stairs and was one floor above when he was struck in the chest by a bullet.

Police claim that Liang appeared to accidentally fire a shot when he was about 10 feet from the 28-year-old and without a word.

After Liang discharged the bullet, he and partner Landau did not respond to radio contact for six and a half minutes, the New York Daily News reported in December.

The Liang's arraignment on Wednesday, prosecutors revealed that Landau argued with Liang over what their next steps should be but did not call for back up or an ambulance, according to the Post.

Prosecutors alleged that Liang's first concern was that he 'was going to be fired' while Mr Gurley's friend fought alone to keep him alive and was forced to find a neighbor to call 911.

Gurley was taken to a nearby hospital where he died.

Liang was released without bail on Wednesday. 

A Brooklyn grand jury heard the case against Liang for just a few days before they decided to issue an indictment on Tuesday.

Gurley's girlfriend, Kimberly Michelle Ballinger, who was with him at the time of the shooting, is seen leaving Brooklyn court on Wednesday 

The indictment came after mass protests and calls for reform of the grand jury system nationwide following a Staten Island grand jury's refusal to indict a NYPD cop in the chokehold death of Eric Garner and a Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict an officer in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown.

The November death of Gurley, 28, was ruled a 'homicide' by the Medical Examiner's office - the same verdict was given in father-of-six Eric Garner's death.  

The New York Police Department assigns rookie officers as reinforcements in parts of the city that have seen increases in crime. 

The Louis Pink housing project had been the scene of a recent shooting along with robberies and assaults. 

The NYPD almost immediately declared Mr Gurley's death a 'very unfortunate tragedy' and Commissioner Bill Bratton described the 28-year-old as a 'total innocent'.

Police officials pieced together the details of the shooting from radio reports and interviews with Mr Gurley's friend and the second officer. 

Liang was placed on desk duty after the shooting.
