He's still best known to millions as the anarchic punk Vyvyan in the hit 1980s sitcom The Young Ones. But actor Ade Edmondson’s latest choice of role couldn’t be further from a student with spiky hair and a string of metal stars stuck across his forehead – he’s about to play an aristocrat in a new BBC adaptation of Tolstoy’s epic War And Peace.

The 1869 story of love and betrayal is set against the backdrop of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia, and follows the fortunes of five aristocratic families over the course of the conflict that ravages Europe.

Edmondson, 56, will play tragic Count Ilya Rostov, who squanders the inheritance of his four children. Lily James – Downton Abbey’s Lady Rose – has landed the part of Rostov’s beautiful daughter Natasha, a role played by Audrey Hepburn in a 1956 Hollywood version.

White Mischief star Greta Scacchi will play Rostov’s imperious wife Natalya, and rising star James Norton, who portrayed a rapist in the BBC1 drama Happy Valley, is dashing Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, one of the two principal male characters in the novel.

American star Paul Dano, recently seen as a brutal plantation carpenter in Oscar-winning film 12 Years A Slave, will take on the pivotal male role of Pierre Bezhukov, a misfit whose social and economic prospects are transformed when he inherits a family fortune.

The adaptation is by Bafta-winning scriptwriter Andrew Davies, whose previous acclaimed work for the Corporation includes Pride And Prejudice and Bleak House.

Last night Davies admitted that he had read the novel for the first time only relatively recently. He said: ‘I was struck by how fresh and modern the characters and relationships felt. It’s a story of the hopes and dreams of youth. We get love, friendship, huge swings of fortune, betrayals, tragedy and a surprising amount of comedy.’

The drama is one of the most ambitious projects mounted by the BBC in recent years. Filming begins next month and scenes are to be shot on location in Russia, Lithuania and Latvia. War And Peace will be screened in six one-hour episodes on BBC1 at the end of next year.

Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is producing the series with the BBC, said: ‘Putting an epic, iconic story like War And Peace on screen is an incredible thrill. Lily, Paul and James are all amazing actors.’

Davies’s adaptation is not the only forthcoming production of War And Peace. On New Year’s Day, Radio 4 is presenting a ten-hour version with a cast including John Hurt Lesley Manville and Simon Russell Beale.
