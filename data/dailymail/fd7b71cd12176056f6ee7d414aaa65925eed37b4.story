Cricket is mourning one of its greatest bowlers following the death of Yorkshire legend Bob Appleyard on Tuesday, aged 90.

Despite making his first-class debut at 27, Appleyard, who bowled a mixture of medium pace and off spin, wasted no time in taking 200 wickets in his maiden season - and racked up a total of 708 between 1950 and 1958 at an average of 15.48.

Bradford-born Appleyard played just nine Tests for England but took 31 wickets at 17.87 and was an Ashes winner in Australia in 1954-55.

He suffered tuberculosis in his youth and his career was cut short by worsening health. 

‘He didn’t play as long as he should,’ said Yorkshire club president Dickie Bird. ‘If he had, he would have broken all records.’
