As the sun beats down on crops and plants in Alsace, north east France, one gardening centre has found a way to make their flowers last a little longer.

Horticulturists at the Callunas centre in the village of Rosheim dye their heather in different colours, creating not only spectacular, colourful fields, but also heather in brilliant pink, purple, blue, green, orange and yellow.

The idea came in the autumn season after the plants had lost their sparkle and turned brown.

The brightly coloured heather is particularly popular with the Germans and Scandinavians

Gardeners dye the heather in a field this afternoon - the colouring technique is refined and has turned local heather into bestsellers

Explains David Freimann, who works for Callunas: 'The plants are usually pink, but we got the idea to dye them after they dried and turned brown too quickly.

'We wanted to copy the natural colour, which is pink, so they would stay pink longer. Then we tried and tested with other colours and they have now become the most well-known products we have.'

The dying process is unique and has been refined enough for the farmers to produce over 3 million flowers each year in 29 acres.

They now export to the rest of Europe. The Germans and Scandinavians particularly like the brightly coloured heather.
