Liverpool are discussing Samuel Eto’o as a potential candidate as the club look to bring in a new striker.

Eto’o is available following his release from Chelsea at the end of last season and would provide experience to Brendan Rodgers’ squad.

Rodgers has been looking for a forward since a deal for Loic Remy collapsed but Eto’o, at this stage, is no more than just under consideration.

From Blue to Red? Eto’o could be set to join Liverpool after leaving Chelsea

The 33-year-old does not fit the profile Liverpool have tended to sign under Fenway Sports Group’s ownership but he is a three-time Champions League winner and Liverpool, who will return to that competition after a five-season absence, are short of players with that experience. 

Inter Milan and Ajax have also spoken to the player's representatives in recent days.

Liverpool expect Radamel Falcao to join Real Madrid from Monaco while Swansea's Wilfried Bony remains in Rodgers' thinking but would be expensive.
