A British schoolboy plunged more than 100ft to his death in Dubai after an alcohol-fuelled row.

Harry Harling, 15, wrote online that he was enjoying ‘beers and tanning’ with friends in the United Arab Emirates last Friday.

Hours later, an ‘angry’ Harry was seen leaving a house party alone after an argument.

Happy: Harry Harling, 15, had been drinking at a party into the early hours of Saturday morning before becoming separated from his friends

He left a cryptic message on Twitter – ‘**** the system’ – before apparently jumping to his death from the 11th floor of a nearby building site.

Harry’s father Nicolus, 49, and mother Beverley, 46, were last night being comforted by friends from Dubai’s close-knit expat community. They settled in the region after leaving their £740,000 home on a private estate in Woking, Surrey, nine years ago.

Both Harry and his sister Rebecca, 19, were enrolled at £9,500-a-year Jumeirah College, which is popular with wealthy British expatriates.

Local police are investigating how Harry gained access to the building site, as well as how he and his friends got hold of alcohol in a country where its sale is severely restricted due to Muslim laws.

One theory is that the boys were given the drinks by an adult at the party.

Harry, who had been due to play in the final round of a rugby tournament on Saturday, is believed to have rowed with a friend on Friday night. The pair were pulled apart, and Harry then stormed out.

His friends are thought to have stayed at the party for about an hour longer. Some wrote of their regrets on Facebook. Harry Francis said: ‘Mate I’m so sorry, I should never have left you alone on Friday.

‘I should have stayed with you till you got a taxi. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.’

James Ozden replied: ‘Everyone is thinking of ways they could have changed  the outcome, but it’s not fair for you to blame yourself!’

Dubai police chief Brigadier Khaleel Ibraheem Al Mansouri confirmed that Harry  had fallen from a building in the Motor  City district – an area that is still largely under construction.

‘Our investigation shows that he was attending a party with his friends in a flat in the same area and was consuming alcohol when a big dispute took place between them,’ he said. ‘He left the party angry and went to an empty building nearby, and jumped from a window on the 11th floor and died instantly.

Distraught: Harry was in Year 11 at Jumeirah College in the UAE. Head teacher Fiona Cottam said counselling was available to distraught staff and pupils

‘His friends said that they didn’t know what he was going to do.

‘Investigations are on-going to ascertain the reason behind the dispute which made the teenager end his life.’

He called for parents in the expat community to ‘watch their children to make sure they don’t get into problems with drugs or alcohol’.

Former neighbours of the Harlings, who once lived in a substantial double-fronted detached property on a private road in Woking, described them as ‘lovely’. Barney Powell, 49, lives in the close, where houses now sell for about £1.2million.

He said Harry’s father had worked as a trader in the City.

Tragic: Harry had been had been at a party with friends in Dubai where he lived with his ex-pat family

‘They were a lovely family,’ he added. ‘When Harry was here  he was only around five, but you used to see him playing with his sister Rebecca, who was a few years older.’

Harry’s paternal grandmother Cecilia Poupart, 71, who lives close to the former family home, was too upset to speak yesterday.

In England, Harry attended Hoe Bridge School, a private prep school which charges up to £13,000 a year. Rebecca went to Halstead Preparatory School for Girls, which charges £11,000 a year.

Dubai’s English-language Jumeirah College was set up in 1999 to meet the growing demand of the expat population.

British students are in the majority at the school, where classes are based on the English national  curriculum and pupils sit GCSEs  and A-levels.

Students play cricket, football and rugby, and the school even takes part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme.
