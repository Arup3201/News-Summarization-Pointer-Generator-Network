A husband has been arrested on suspicion of beating his wife to death with a vacuum cleaner  six months ago.

Anthony Tyron Mayo, 37, is accused of murdering his wife Beverly McFarlane, 40, at their North Las Vegas home in August.

Ms McFarlane was taken to hospital when police were called to her house and she told them she had been beaten.

Despite treatment, she died at the University Medical Center two weeks later.

Police arrested Mayo on Tuesday at an apartment in Mojave City, California, following a joint investigation between forces in Southern California and Nevada and the FBI.

Mayo faces charges of murder, coercion and domestic battery by strangulation, according to the LA Times.

Ms McFarlane called police on August 10 and alleged that her husband had strangled her before hitting her on 
the head with a vacuum cleaner two days earlier.

She was taken to University Medical Center and treated for a brain injury but died two weeks later on August 23.

Following her death, Mayo fled and despite numerous appeals police were not able to find him.

He is currently in a Los Angeles Police Department jail awaiting extradition to Nevada.

The couple have two children, aged five and nine years old, who were in the house at the time of the alleged attack, according to the LA Times.

Neither are believed to have been physically harmed.

During the appeals, police said Mayo had the name of his wife tattooed on his right forearm and the words 'RIP Jr' on his right shoulder.

Ms McFarlane's family said she was so severely injured that she could not recognise them when they visited her in hospital.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
