It's gone: Olympic opening ceremony mastermind Danny Boyle says that good feelings that swept across Britain in London 2012 are dead

Olympic opening ceremony architect Danny Boyle has declared the feel-good factor that spread across Britain because of London 2012 is dead.

The Games' creative director believes the positive spirit has been crushed by economic gloom.

Mr Boyle, who was roundly praised for his work in masterminding London's £27 million Olympic opening ceremony, said he felt the positive impact of the Games before they started and after they ended.

But he said the public has returned to their 'private battles', adding that it was 'naive' to hope the optimism of the Games would continue.

'I think it would be naive to say it could last,' he told The Sun.

'It's nice to have a filip like that to feel good together, then you get back to your private battles.

'Obviously we are in tough economic times which means it is difficult finding jobs for people.'

Boyle turned down a knighthood for his work saying 'it’s just not me' despite being touted for the New Year Honours list for creating the highly praised spectacle.

He said he would not have felt right accepting an individual award as a cast of thousands - including the Queen - helped create it.

'It’s just not me. I also thought it was wrong, actually,' he told the Radio Times.

'You can make these speeches about "this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah".

'And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people.

'I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.'

He and his artistic team sent a 'script' to Buckingham Palace.

It was in the hope Queen would agree to a surprise appearance in the much loved James Bond skit, which saw her accompanied to the Games by Britain’s top secret agent.

The unexpected scene was one of the quirky highlights of the ceremony.

He said: 'Basically we thought there are two scenarios.

'They’ll either agree, provided we do it with a good double (and we promised them that we’d either get a really good actor, a Helen Mirren-style actor, or we’d get a cracking double, so it wasn’t poking fun), or it will be a no.'
