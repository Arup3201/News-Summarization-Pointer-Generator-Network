The stars of a new BBC documentary People Like Us have accused the programme makers of making them look 'fat, drunk and destitute'.

The six-part BBC Three series follows a versatile selection of residents living in Harpurhey, Manchester - which was named the most deprived neighbourhood in Britain ten years ago.

But the locals featured in the documentary believe they have been made to look like 'Jeremy Kyle Show-type chavs' - a talk show well known for its outbursts of swearing and violence from guests and its frequent paternity tests.

Angry: Residents in Harpurhey, Manchester, have accused TV producers of making them look like 'chavs' who live in a 'slum' in a new documentary on BBC Three

They have also criticised producers for making their home town look 'like a slum'.

More than 300 residents attended a public meeting last night to voice their outage at the People Like Us programme, The Daily Star reports.

They claim they were tricked into taking part and believed the programme would show how the area had improved.

Council worker Richard Searle alleged that his daughter Rosie, 21, was given alcohol before the cameras were turned on.

Mr Searle commented: 'This Jeremy Kyle-style, laugh-at-the-chavs type of television has run its course and the BBC should not be propagating this harmful and misleading image of the working class.'

Another resident Toni Callan, 26, whose footage was not used in the documentary, told 
the newspaper that the film crew bought her and her friends shots of 
alcohol and encouraged them to fight because 'it would make good TV'.

She added: 'They've manufactured the whole documentary.'

Campaigners are threatening to perform a demonstration outside BBC's Media City in Salford if the show isn't cancelled.

The third episode of the show was aired last night and residents have called for the remaining three shows to be axed.

Local Labour MP Graham Stringer plans to write to BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten to ask for an explanation.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We are listening to the range of 
feedback from the local area and contributors, many of whom have been 
positive. 

'People Like Us takes a warm and at times unflinching look at 
the reality of life for young people in Harpurhey and follows a range of
 contributors as they tell their own stories in their own words through 
both good times and bad. 

On camera: Amber Wakefield, 18, whose family runs the local launderette in Harpurhey, Manchester, is one of many local residents to feature on the show

'The series does not focus on negative 
stereotypes, indeed many of those featured are resilient, resourceful 
and ambitious young people with positive stories to tell – from running 
their own businesses to planning their future careers – and they do so 
with captivating wit and enthusiasm.'

The production company Dragonfly said no one was ever encouraged to fight during the making of the show.

A spokesman said: 'Before the series was commissioned, we met with a huge variety of potential contributors, providing reasonable hospitality on occasion.

'Not everyone we met during the research stage was chosen for inclusion in the final series and Toni Callan does not feature in any of the episodes.

'No one was encouraged to fight and we adhered to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines at all times.'
