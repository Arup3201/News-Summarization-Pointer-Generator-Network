England is the only developed country producing school leavers who are worse at maths and reading than their grandparents, according to a damning report.

The study found 16 to 24-year-olds are among the least literate and numerate in the world, lagging behind those in countries including Estonia, Poland and the Slovak Republic.

England came 22nd out of 24 countries for the reading skills of its young people and 21st for maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The figures showed many Japanese school leavers are more advanced than English university graduates.

The OECD said England was the only country where the oldest age group  studied (55-65) had a higher proficiency in  literacy and numeracy than the youngest (16-24) after other factors such as sex, socio-economic background and type of occupation were taken into account.

The organisation warned England would struggle with competitors in global markets unless urgent action was taken.

The Tories said the report exposed the failings of Labour during its 13 years in power. ‘These are Labour’s children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations,’ said skills and enterprise minister Matthew Hancock.

Labour came to power in 1997 after Tony Blair pledged his priority would be ‘education, education, education’.

England was the only country in developed world in which those aged 55-65 performed better than 16-24-year-olds

Today's
 findings show that the billions poured into education by Labour failed 
to push up standards of literacy and numeracy, critics have said.

The
 Government has claimed that the OECD's research underlines who 
'Labour's children, educated under a Labour government and force-fed a 
diet of dumbing down and low expectations.'

Official
 figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown that 
Labour’s spending on education rose from £35.3billion in 2000 to 
£63.9billion in 2009.

Yet it appears large numbers left school with no improvements in standards when compared to previous generations.

Last year a different report found despite Tony Blair declaring his priorities as ‘education, education, 
education’ when he swept to power in 1997, a huge increase in spending 
on schools led to ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’.

The OECD study – Education at a Glance – found that expenditure on 
UK primary and secondary schools and colleges as a percentage of GDP 
increased from 3.6 per cent in 1995 to 4.5 per cent in 2009, higher than
 the OECD average of four per cent.

At the same time, there has been ‘no improvement in student learning outcomes’, the report said

Spending in the sector soared by 78 
per cent from £50billion to £89billion by the time the party lost the 
election in 2010.

During this period, GCSE and A-level grades rose every
 year, which critics claimed was evidence of dumbing down.

Andreas
 Schleicher, of the OECD, said young adults had more qualifications than
 those nearing retirement, but not greater abilities.

This indicated that there had been grade inflation and that qualifications did not necessarily mean better skills.

The finding ‘doesn’t look good for the UK’, Mr Schleicher said.

The 466-page study was the first carried out by the OECD into the work skills of 16  to 65-year-olds, establishing their abilities in literacy, numeracy and problem solving.

A total of 166,000 were interviewed in 24 countries, including 9,000 in England and Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales were not covered.

The study found a quarter of adults in England (8.5million) have the maths skills of a ten-year-old, with a large minority only able to perform sums with whole numbers.

Literacy levels are also below average, with 16.4 per cent of adults (5.8million) reading at the level of a child in the penultimate year of primary school.

Just 42.4 per cent of young adults were proficient in problem solving. This was around 8 percentage points less than the average of 50.7 per cent, and 21 behind the best-performing country, South Korea.

England produced 8 per cent of the world’s most highly skilled workers in the late 1960s and 70s. This has dropped to 4 per cent and the trend is expected to continue.

The report said the ‘talent pool of highly skilled adults in England... is likely to shrink relative to that of other countries’ in the next few decades.

The slide could be reversed only if ‘significant action is taken to improve skills proficiency among young people’.

England also lags behind other nations in the proportion of people continuing with education into adulthood. One positive note was that the country has been successful in making good use of its pool of skilled talent, resulting in high productivity and wages.

The Coalition has taken steps to improve education, demanding an end to grade inflation and making courses and exams tougher. The number of top GCSE and A-level grades has now decreased for the past two years.

John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘The OECD report highlights what our members tell us – that young people don’t have the literacy and numeracy skills to do the job properly. We need action to improve these crucial basic skills from an early age.’

The shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, defended Labour’s record, saying it ‘drove up standards in maths and English across our schools, evident in the huge improvements we saw in GCSE results between 1997 and 2010’.

Failed? The Government said today this generation of young people are 'Labour's children' 'force-fed a diet of dumbing down and low expectations'

Mike Harris, of the Institute of Directors, said the report ‘underlines the credibility gap between the picture painted by decades of rises in exam pass rates and employers’ real-world experience of interviewing and employing people’.

Former Labour education and employment secretary David Blunkett questioned the OECD’s methodology and said the report ‘warranted united action, not party political point scoring’.

Education has undergone massive change since Labour began replacing grammar schools with the comprehensive system in 1965.

In 1988 GCSEs replaced O-levels and the National Curriculum was introduced, and in 1997 Labour abolished the Assisted Places Scheme awarding free places at fee-paying schools to gifted children from low or middle-income families.

The academy schools programme began in 2000, with schools funded by the state and made independent of local government control.

In 2010 the Coalition launched free schools, which are similar to academies  but can be set up by groups including parents, teachers, charities.

Participants in the skills survey were asked to answer a series of questions testing their numeracy, literacy and problem solving. Here are some examples:
