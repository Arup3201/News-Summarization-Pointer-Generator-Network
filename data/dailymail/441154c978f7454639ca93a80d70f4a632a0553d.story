A prominent Muslim leader has lashed out at the Jewish community, calling them 'the most evil creatures of Allah'.

The spokesman for Islamic extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ismail al-Wahwah, delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3.

He went on further to say recognising the Jewish people and giving them 'even a single inch of Palestine' would be the 'epitome of evil' as it would 'strengthen that cancerous entity'.

'The Jews are the most evil creatures of Allah. Moral corruption is linked to the Jews,' Mr al-Wahwah said.

'They will pay with blood for blood, with tears for tears, and with destruction for destruction.'

The surfacing of this video follows the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) filing a complaint with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board against the extremist group.

It was in relation to comments made last year at a rally in Lakemba, where Mr al-Wahwah said Jewish people all around the world were corrupt and they were a 'hidden evil', The Australian Jewish News reported.

JBOD president Jeremy Spinak called on the Anti-Discrimination Board to write a brief up for the public prosecutions department so it could bring charges against Mr al-Wahwah and his fellow spokesman Wassim Doureihi.

'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish,' Mr Spinak wrote. 

NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks

'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish.'

NSW Communities Minister Victor Dominello has also written to the Anti-Discrimination Board to alert them to al-Wahwah's latest video, The Australian reported. 

Mr Dominello said despite the fact Australians enjoy freedom of speech, it should not be abused in this way.

He labelled the video as 'deeply disturbing' as well as 'hateful and derisive'.

'[It] has no place in our harmonious multicultural society,' Mr Dominello told News Corp.

NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks.

A Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman said comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine', referring to the Gaza conflict (above)

'This has nothing to do with Israel and is in the same vein of Islamic extremism and incitement that IS [Islamic State] peddles,' Mr Alhadeff said.

'It's another wake-up call for the authorities to act before these hate preachers inspire the next [Sydney Siege gunman] Man Monis.'

Hizb ut-Tahrir jumped to the defence of Mr al-Wahwah, saying his comments made last year were made during the 'most recent offensive against the people of Gaza', which 'indiscriminately razed homes, schools, hospitals and mosques'.

The group's Tuesday statement also said the JBOD was 'falsely exploiting the words of Hizb ut-Tahrir'.

Hamzah Qureshi, a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman, told News Corp on Wednesday comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine by the illegitimate Israeli army'.
