Following on from Dante and Jerome Boateng's attempts to look good in front of the cameras last week, Cristiano Ronaldo also ensured he was the man to look out for in Cardiff on Tuesday night.

As well as a superb solo performance on the night, scoring twice as Madrid eased to a 2-0 win in the UEFA Super Cup final over Sevilla, the 29-year-old made sure he stood out prior to the game too.

The Portuguese star was seen tiptoeing in the back row of the team photo ahead of the clash in Cardiff, and backed up his big man stance with a scintillating display for the Galaticos.

Big men: Dante and Boateng appear to pull their shirts tight together to show off their physique in a squad photo

Just days earlier Dante and Jerome Boateng made similar stances as they pulled their shirts tight at the back, seemingly in a move to look good for the cameras.

Elsewhere, Ronaldo will look to continue his stunning form for the European Champions this season after scoring 50 goals in all competitions for the club last season as they won the Champions League for a historic 10th time in their history.

The former Manchester United forward will no doubt play a pivotal role again for Carlo Ancelotti's side as they look to get back on track domestically after finishing 3rd in La Liga last time out.
