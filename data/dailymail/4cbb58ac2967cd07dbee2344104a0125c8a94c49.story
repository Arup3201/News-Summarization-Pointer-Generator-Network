One ambitious young artist has transplanted a chocolate-making factory line from his native Colombia to New York City to create 7,000 candies per day – all of which will be free to the public.

By showcasing Colombia’s popular Chocmelo marshmallow candy as art, Oscar Murillo, 28, hopes to create a narrative about globalization, immigration, and community inside the renowned David Zwirner gallery.

The exhibit, titled ‘A Mercantile Novel’, which opens today, brings a piece of Mr Murillo’s hometown of La Paila, Colombia to the U.S. – including 13 factory workers who have never before left their native country.

Transplanted: Artist Oscar Murillo has brought Colombia's Colombina chocolate factory to New York City's David Zwirner gallery

In-house operation: The factory will produce 7,000 of Colombina's Chocmelo candies each day, which will be free to the public

Outward view: David Zwirner's 19th Street outpost is located in New York's West Chelsea neighborhood, home to the city's most famous art galleries

Mr Murillo did not choose to feature the Chocmelo on a whim. Rather, he feels a strong connection to candy’s owner, Colombina – his hometown’s largest employer – as generations of his family have worked in the company’s factories, including his own parents.

His latest exhibit, housed in Mr Zwirner’s 19th Street location, hopes to offer both strong in-person and social media experiences for gallery-goers. As Mr Murillo explained in a press conference yesterday afternoon, the show is a ‘social endeavor.’

Upon entering A Mercantile Novel, guests are greeted by an acute sugar smell, which materializes all around in crates and trays full of Chocmelos that are free for the taking.

Its lobby 
is filled with TVs displaying a live feed of the factory line that has 
been set up within the gallery – an area which has been cut off from 
guests for sanitary purposes. The streaming footage can also be viewed 
online throughout the show’s run.

It
 depicts Colombina employees, dressed in stark white uniforms and 
goggles, creating a pillowy confection that is one of Colombina’s 
best-sellers throughout Latin America, with nearly 5million pieces 
clearing store shelves each year.

Bright young thing: Mr Murillo (center, black shirt) is only 28, but has already shown at LACMA and the Saatchi Gallery, since signing with David Zwirner in September 2013 (pictured, Mr Murillo poses with members of the Colombina staff inside his new exhibit)

Special design: Mr Murillo has custom created the smiley face wrappers for his exhibition, as a way to merge a NYC icon with that of Colombina

Gallery-goers will receive the 
chocolate-covered marshmallows in a wrapper that Mr Murillo has 
custom-designed to provide subliminal commentary on the exhibit’s deeper
 meaning.

The silver
 envelopes come branded with Colombina’s signature red, white, and blue 
logo, as well as the bright yellow smiley face that adorns many of New 
York’s plastic shopping bags.

In
 merging the two icons, the London-based artist somewhat simplistically 
represents the A Mercantile Novel’s personal message – which touches 
upon his own experiences with Colombina as well as trans-Atlantic 
immigration.

It's a touching sentiment that carries throughout his entire body of art which most often takes the form of large-scale paintings. A young success by art's standards, Mr Murillo has already exhibited in esteemed locations including the Saatchi Gallery and LACMA since first joining the David Zwirner gallery in September 2013.

Restricted area: While press were able to navigate the factory facilities yesterday, gallery goers will see the candy process on live stream footage, screened on TVs in the gallery lobby

Ever the millennial, Mr Murillo's shiny, Instagram-friendly wrappers also accomplish another of the exhibit’s main objectives – for gallery-goers to share their Chocmelo experience on social media.

Because there is no limit to how many Chocmelos guest may take, Mr Murillo hopes that patrons will offer the candies to their friends, families, even strangers, while documenting this shared enjoyment with photos tagged #MercantileNovel.

But the 
show is much more than just a load of free candy, or even using candy as
 a decorative medium, as artists like Will Cotton have so successfully 
accomplished in the past.

It has afforded 13 Colombians the opportunity to leave their country for the very first time.

The
 candy technicians have arrived to the U.S. on special artists’ visas, 
and will work the gallery’s regular hours of 10am to 6pm from Tuesday 
through Saturday.

Deeper meaning: Mr Murillo's family, including his mother (pictured) have worked at the Colombina factory, which is his hometown's single largest employer

Throughout A Mercantile Novel’s nearly three-week-long run, they will reside in a community of apartments in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

César Caicedo, Colombina’s CEO, told MailOnline that the experience ‘has been incredible – we were afraid that so many parts in the process would get stuck, but it ended up working perfectly. It’s almost too good to be true.’

From Colombina’s perspective, A Mercantile Novel is an interesting way to introduce its products to the American audience.

Mr
 Caicedo said that ‘From a commercial point of view it’s nice to show 
Americans that there is a company down in South America that has good 
vibes, that is making delicious candy…and wants to give prosperity to 
people who work for the company.’

Millennial concept: Guests are encouraged to share these packages with friends, families, and even strangers, while documenting the entire experience on Instagram

Last evening at dinner held in the project’s honor at Mr Zwirner’s Manhattan townhouse, the entire Colombina fleet broke out into a celebratory salsa dance.

Mr Caicedo says that ’One of the girls told me when we were dancing: “I never dreamt I would be dancing salsa in a beautiful home in New York” It’s a short phrase that describes a lot.’
