Fall: Lisa A. Stilkey died after she fell from the second floor of her home

A former International Arm Wrestling Federation arm wrestler has been arrested after his wife died falling from the second-storey window of their home.

Allen M. Stilkey, 40, was charged in the death of Lisa A. Stilkey, 44, after the incident at their Douglas home, Massachusetts.

Douglas police were called to their home just after midnight on Friday.

An ambulance took Mrs. Stilkey to 
UMass Memorial Medical Center  University Campus in Worcester, but she
was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police said Mr. Stilkey was initially taken 
from the scene in protective custody, but later released.

He was then asked to return to the station where he was arrested about 7:40 p.m.

The window of their home was not broken, but it 
appeared that police were paying attention to the surrounding area after
finding a pillow from the grass outside the home, reported Fox 25.

Mr.
Stilkey, faces charges of manslaughter, assault and battery and 
threatening to commit a crime, according to Timothy J. Connolly, 
spokesman for District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr.

He is being held on $500,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Uxbridge District Court, Mr. Connolly said.

In 2009, Mr. Stilkey moved into the home in Douglas, but shared it with his fiancé, Lisa Valliere.

Neighbor Craig Couffer said he was interviewed by police yesterday.

He described Mrs. Stilkey and her husband as a nice young couple, who appeared to be close.

'They were always with each other,' he told Worcester Telegram and Gazette.

Linda Bombara, who lives across Gilboa Street from the Stilkeys, said she went to high school with Lisa Stilkey and that her daughter would go on vacations with her.

Mrs. Bombara said Mrs. Stilkey was a nice person.

'I'm shocked,' she said.

Before he moved to Massachusetts, Stilkey was the Rhode Island director for the International Armwrestling Federation, and traveled throughout the country competing and winning titles, said William Cox of Lakeville, executive director of the federation to Bostom.com.

He is listed as arm wrestler of the year for 1995 on the group’s website.

'I’ve never known him to be violent,' Mr Cox said. 'I’ve known quite a few of the girlfriends he’s had in the past. I’ve never heard anything vaguely, or remotely related to abuse,' he told the website.
