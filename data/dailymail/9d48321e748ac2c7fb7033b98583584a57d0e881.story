The U.S. Open tennis referee accused of beating her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee mug is out on bail after paying the reduced $500,000 fine.

The Los Angeles native Lois Ann Goodman, 70, was in New York at the time of her August 21 arrest because she was due to work at the famed tennis tournament, and she was released from the authorities on Sunday in lieu of bail.

After granting her a bail reduction from $1million to $500,000, the Van Nuys, California superior court commissioner Mitchell Block ruled that she could be released to home confinement when electronic monitoring is set up.

The commissioner cited her ties to the community and lack of criminal record in making that decision.

Goodman entered a plea of not guilty and her daughter calls the allegations 'completely ridiculous'.

Prosecutor Sharon Ranson paints a different pictures of Goodman, telling the judge that she went to get a manicure as her husband lay dying, according to the Los Angeles Times.

In arguing for reduced bail, Treissl 
argued that there was no chance Goodman would flee as she does not have a
passport and has strong ties to the San Fernando Valley where she was 
born and raised.

She
added that Goodman cooperated with the police investigation and 
submitted to three interviews, even driving herself to the police 
station when she was summoned.

'She arrived on time and was utterly forthcoming,' Triessl said.

Given
Goodman's cooperation, she said the Los Angeles Police Department 
should have waited to arrest her; they could have asked her to turn 
herself in in California and she would have obliged.

About two dozen supporters filled the courtroom.

Goodman,
who has refereed matches between many tennis greats, was arrested last 
week in New York just before she was to referee at the U.S. Open.

Plea: She was extradited back to Los Angeles for her trial, but her lawyer has asked for her bail to be reduced

'Victim': Her husband of nearly 50 years, Alan

Goodman told cops she found him after coming home and believed he had 
fallen

Her husband, 80-year-old Alan Goodman, died in April.

Authorities initially believed he likely fell down stairs at home while she was away, but later decided it was murder.

Goodman, who is well-known in 
professional tennis circles, stands accused of murdering her husband, 
Alan, at their condominium in Los Angeles, California, on April 17 by 
smashing a coffee mug over his head and stabbing him to death with the 
sharp, broken handle.

The prosecution asserted Wednesday that the victim was struck 10 times on the head and there was evidence of Lois Goodman’s premeditation and no remorse.

Defense attorney Alison Triessl has claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, 
hearing loss and constant spinal pain that's controlled by an electronic
device implanted in her spine.

She has also had two knee replacements, Triessl said.

Triessl wrote in a previous filing that Goodman has many infirmities, including knee and shoulder replacements, and couldn't have bludgeoned her husband to death.

She had also submitted 40 
testimonial letters from colleagues, neighbours, family and friends, 
lauding Goodman as a beloved friend, mother and grandmother who treated 
her husband like a king and was never violent.

Questions: Goodman, right, features in a sketch in a Manhattan court last Friday before she was sent to L.A.

The mother of three told authorities she had arrived home to find the blood-covered coffee mug and her husband lying in bed not breathing after apparently falling down the stairs.

But after paramedics and investigators became suspicious of the man's grisly injuries - including deep wounds to his head - Goodman was arrested on a murder charge.

She was arrested last week in New York, 
where she was preparing for this week's U.S. Open - just one 
of many high-profile tournaments she had worked since 1979.

Claims have also emerged that she was
having an affair, after police found emails and handwritten letters to 
another man during a search of the house.

'Lois minimised what she had seen,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department said
of an interview four days after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to
what she had seen and the loss of her husband was not typical of a 
grieving spouse.'

She 
had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading 
upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood.

Arrest: Goodman was arrested for murder by NYPD last week while still wearing her U.S. Open uniform

She followed the blood to her
bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the 
affidavit. She then called 911.

Investigators
also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had 
suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said.

When
she was questioned again, Goodman said the body looked as if it had 
been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, 
Goodman has protested her innocence.

She
has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years and has umpired
with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with 
Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.

In
a 1994 interview with the L.A. Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is
my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best 
players. There's no real way to describe it.'
