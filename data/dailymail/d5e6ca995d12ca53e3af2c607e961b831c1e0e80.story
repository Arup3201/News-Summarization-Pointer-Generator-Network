Ronald Koeman emerged from a thorough drenching at Turf Moor and a fourth straight defeat sounding every bit like a man who is starting to lose patience with his players.

After outplaying Manchester United at home on Monday night and losing, Saints were the better team again here. But Tom Heaton’s brilliant penalty save from Dusan Tadic proved to be the turning point and Ashley Barnes snatched the winner 17 minutes from time to lift Burnley clear of the relegation zone.

Worse still for Koeman, the goal came from a Southampton throw-in close to their own penalty box and at a point in the game when they were dominant.

Nathaniel Clyne took the throw and received the ball back from Steven Davis. However, when he tried to play the ball down the line, it was charged down by Danny Ings. The ball ran loose for Barnes, whose shot looked unlikely to trouble Fraser Forster until it took a deflection off Toby Alderweireld and rolled inside the England goalkeeper’s near post.

‘Of course I’m very disappointed,’ said a dejected Koeman. ‘It’s been the same story in the last few games. You can make football very difficult but I don’t like to do that because it’s simple. This isn’t the first time.

‘It’s about scoring from chances and more mistakes in defence. That’s why we had a row of winning games and why we didn’t win today or against United. Maybe it’s confidence now after four defeats.

‘From the start of the second half to missing the penalty we played great football. We had total domination and I was waiting for the goal. 

'We had chances to kill the game but then one mistake — I call it a mistake because our throw-in ends in a goal for Burnley — and that’s disappointing.’

This win made it 12 points from six games for Burnley, who looked doomed to relegation when they were still waiting for their first win a month ago.

In a contest of two very contrasting styles, Sean Dyche’s team had the better of the first half but were on the back foot in torrential rain after half-time and should have gone behind when Southampton won their penalty.

There was little doubt about the decision from referee Mark Clattenburg: Ryan Bertrand sold George Boyd a dummy and the Burnley forward took the defender down with his outstretched right foot.

Tadic scored 11 penalties in two seasons at FC Twente before joining Southampton in the summer and this one seemed good enough, steered low inside the post with his left foot. But Heaton anticipated brilliantly and lunged full-length to turn it away with both hands.

Koeman was unimpressed. ‘In my opinion it was not a good penalty,’ said the Dutchman. 

‘Tadic is a specialist. Maybe it’s confidence. It was good goalkeeping but (the shot) was not very hard. It’s a bad penalty.’

Southampton went agonisingly close to equalising in the closing stages but Clyne fired inches wide of the post and an unmarked Victor Wanyama somehow headed over in added time.

‘You need a scratch of luck and we got that with the goal,’ said Dyche. ‘The same can’t be said for the penalty save because it was outstanding. They’re the margins and we’ve been on the wrong side of them at times.

‘Southampton have brought in quality and £60million speaks for itself. We had to work very hard to get a result and we’ve done that.
