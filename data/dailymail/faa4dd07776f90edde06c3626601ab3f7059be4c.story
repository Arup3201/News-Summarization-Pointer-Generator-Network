A gang of scammers were found guilty of cheating £1million of jewellery and watches from top auction houses including Christie's and Bonham's today.

Farouk Dougui, 39, Jabey Bathurst, 23, and Simohamed Rahmoun, 30, used stolen credit cards to buy the luxury items during a seven month scam.

Rahmoun, who was on benefits at the time, splashed out on a number of expensive cars, including a Bentley convertible, Audis and Mini Coopers using profits from the crime.

Guilty: Farouk Dougui

Guilty: Jabey Bathurst

Guilty plea: Simohamed Rahmoun

The gang used the credit card details stolen from people in Canada and the US to use false names to register with auction houses as telephone bidders.

A nationwide investigation led by Wiltshire Police found that more than 40 companies across the UK were conned by the gang in a fraud worth more than £800,000 between April and November 2010.

Dougui, from south east London and Bathurst, of Ruislip, Middlesex, were found guilty by a jury at Isleworth Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud following a six-week trial.

Co-accused Rahmoun, of Chiswick, west London, pleaded guilty to the same charge during the trial.

A fourth defendant, Barbara Goossens, 61, who ran a jewellery shop, was acquitted of conspiracy to defraud.

During the trial prosecutors said Rahmoun and Dougui would contact auction houses and show an interest in expensive lots.

The items they successfully bid for were picked up by courier Bathurst, who was using a false name.

Robin Shellard, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case about a very modern way of stealing because it requires nothing more than the details of credit cards and often a convincing manner.

'The victims in this case are some of the country’s best known auction houses, provincial auction houses and also some little known jewellery shops.

'But when it comes to the victims of these crimes, the defendants were not overly concerned who they targeted as long as they had items of high value they could easily dispose of without getting caught.'

He added: 'How the fraud was perpetrated was in fact, the prosecution say, remarkably easy as long as you had the right connections to obtain the credit card details in the first place and the knowledge of how the system worked and the gall really to carry out the deceptions.'

Dougui, Bathurst and Rahmoun were remanded in custody and will be sentenced on February 26.

Detective Constable Amanda Carver, who led the investigation on behalf of Wiltshire Police, said after the verdict: 'The three offenders worked together in their plan to defraud by using foreign based fake credit cards to pay for valuable jewellery at a number of high-profile auction houses.

'They also purchased electrical goods and car parts.

'By the time the victims became aware the cards were fake, the offenders had collected the items which were worth many thousands of pounds.

'My investigation highlighted victim after victim and the true extent of their fraudulent activity only became clear when I collated all the similar offences from across the country and abroad.

'Companies across the UK were defrauded in excess of £800,000. This included businesses based in Salisbury, Swindon, Corsham and Trowbridge.

'The offenders used their criminal activities to fund a lifestyle that was way beyond their legitimate means.

'Rahmoun was claiming benefit at the time of these offences but had very high value cars at his disposal in Morocco and Spain.

'The group showed no remorse for the distress and financial difficulties they caused their victims.'
