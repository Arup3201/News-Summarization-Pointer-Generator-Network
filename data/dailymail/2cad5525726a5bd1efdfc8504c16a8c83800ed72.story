From Lady Gaga to Nicki Minaj, MAC Cosmetics is renowned for featuring striking and somewhat eccentric females as the faces of its campaigns.

The use of these females has helped establish the brand as groundbreaking. And now, to continue the running theme, MAC have announced another unconventional woman as the face of their new cosmetic collection: a female bodybuilder.

Serbian figure competitor Jelena Abbou is the star of the campaign for the global brand's new Strength collection.

In a powerful ad campaign, Abbou can be seen flexing her finely honed arms wearing a figure-hugging black latex dress with her hair in a tight bun.

She is, of course, groomed to perfection with dramatic MAC make-up, complete with feline eye flicks and bold blood-red lipstick.

Strict diet: Jelena sticks to a protein rich diet to maintain her killer figure

Unlike the former MAC stars, Jelena Abbou isn't a name that is quite so well known in showbiz circles - for now.

Born in April 1977 in Gornji Milanovac, Serbia, Jelena is a figure competitor-turned-model and personal trainer who currently resides in the United States.

The brunette beauty stands at 5ft 6in and is well-known in the fitness world for her natural beauty and toned physique, which she puts down to a high-protein diet.

Out with the old: Nicki Minaj has been replaced by the body builder

Jelena has graced the front covers of numerous magazines like Muscle and Fitness Hers, Natural Bodybuilding, Oxygen and has inked endorsement deals with Aetrex Shoes and Landice Treadmills.

MAC's 'Strength' cosmetic 
collection, which includes everything from eyeshadows to bright 
lipsticks, encourages users to: 'Flex your femininity with a colour 
collection that's fearless, elegant and strong.

'Strike a powerful pose, stand out, redefine the notion of beauty - and do it with strength too irresistible to ignore.'
