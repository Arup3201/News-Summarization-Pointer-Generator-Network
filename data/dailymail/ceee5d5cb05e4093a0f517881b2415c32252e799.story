Russian secret services have confirmed the killing of their 'most wanted' man, the Islamic terrorist leader and Chechen warlord Doku Umarov.

Umarov, who was once dubbed 'Russia's Bin Laden', was 'neutralised' in a 'combat operation' which left dozens of terrorists dead, according to the country's Federal Security Service (FSB) announced.

A 
website sympathetic to the Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus had reported that Umarov had been killed on 
March 18, but Moscow had not 
previously confirmed the report, until today.

'Most wanted': Russian secret services have confirmed the killing of Islamic terrorist leader Doku Umarov

Umarov, who had called for attacks on this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi, was the leader of the  Caucasus Emirate organisation which aims to establish an independent Islamic State in the region.

The group, which is blamed attacks in Moscow in 2010 and 2011 that 
killed a total of 77 people, is also listed as a terrorist organisation by the United 
States.

Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, told a meeting of Russia's 
National Anti-Terrorism Committee: 'As
 a result of a combat operation, the activity of the head of the 
terrorist organisation Caucasus Emirate, Umarov, was neutralised,'

Mr Bortnikov's comments were distributed in a video clip, one day after President 
Vladimir Putin delivered a speech in which he said there must be no 
let-up in the fight against 
the militants.

'Neutralised': Moscow claims that Umarov was killed in a 'combat operation' that left dozens of insurgents dead

Atrocity: Umarov's Caucasus Emirate group claimed responsibility for the bomb that caused the November 2009 Nevsky Express train derailment  that left 27 dead

The group is also thought to have been behind three suicide bombings in the southern Russian city of Volgograd which killed 41 people in 2013, including this attack on a trolleybus

Umarov united 
local militant groups in the North Caucasus under his command in 2007 
and led the violent struggle to create a caliphate in the patchwork of 
mainly Muslim provinces sitting on Russia's southern border.

Bortnikov 
gave no details of the combat operation, however the state-funded RT news channel said dozens of 
terrorists had been killed and hundreds of militants and their 
supporters were detained.

In
 the first three months of 2014, Russia’s security services conducted 33
 counter-terrorist operations and have  eliminated 13 warlords and 65 
active members of the terrorist 
underworld, with over 240 terrorists have been arrested, RT reported.

The
 death of Umarov is a breakthrough for Putin in the fight against the 
Caucasus Emirate, although it already has appointed a new leader who identified himself as 
Ali Abu Mukhammad in a video posted on You Tube.

Putin
 crushed a separatist rebellion in Chechnya when he first rose to power 
14 years ago but the insurgency has since spread to neighbouring 
Dagestan.

Failed mission: Umarov had urged his fighters in a video posted online last July to use 'maximum force' to prevent Putin staging the Winter Olympics in Sochi, seen here during the closing ceremony

The Caucasus Emirate group said it was behind suicide bombings that killed 
37 people at a Moscow airport in 2011 and 40 on the Moscow subway in 
2010.

The group is also 
widely thought to have masterminded three deadly bombings that killed 41people in the
 southern Russian city of Volgograd in as many months, before Russia 
hosted the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi.

Umarov,
 who styled himself as the Emir of the Caucasus Emirate, had urged his 
fighters in a video posted online last July to use 'maximum force' to 
prevent Putin staging the Olympics.

His death would be a breakthrough for President Vladimir Putin in the fight against the militants.
