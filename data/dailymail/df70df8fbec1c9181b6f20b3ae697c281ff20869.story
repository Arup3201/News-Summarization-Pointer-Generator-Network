Drivers in New York City and on Long Island have been lining up at gas stations since before dawn after fuel rationing was enforced in the city for the first time since the early 1970s.

New York City cops were out in force at gas stations this morning to enforce a gasoline-rationing system in
which drivers can only buy fuel on a limited number of days, depending on their license plate number.

The order, announced yesterday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, applies to every driver in the city with the exception of taxis, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles and buses. Cars with medical plates are also be exempt.

Should gas rationing be enforced in the wake of Hurricane Sandy?

All affected drivers are prohibited from
buying gas every other day, under the emergency rule. Those with 
license plate IDs ending in odd numbers will only be permitted to buy 
gas on odd-numbered days, while those with license plates ending in even
numbers will be restricted to buying gas on even-numbered days.

Drivers with license plates ending in letters or other characters must buy their gas on odd-numbered days.

Only a quarter of the city's gas 
stations are currently open. Some are closed because they are 
out of power, others because they can't get fuel from terminals and 
storage tanks that can't unload their cargo.

At a Hess station in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, drivers said the rationing appeared to be working so far.Luis Cruz, 35, of the Bronx, gassed up the Dodge minivan he uses as a pet chauffeur. 'It's a lot better,' Cruz said. 'A couple of days ago I waited four hours. They should have done this a long time ago.'The line to the station was just a block and a half long Friday morning, and customers said they waited about 15 minutes. Last week, some lines stretched for a mile or more.

Why has rationing been introduced?Superstorm Sandy seriously damaged the north east region’s petroleum infrastructure and rationing will help ease long waits at the pumps and prevent panic-buying.How long is it expected to last?No definitive end date has been set, but Mayor Bloomberg has said shortages could last another couple of weeks.How does the license plate system work?Those drivers with license plate IDs ending in odd numbers are only permitted to buy gas on odd-numbered days, while those with license plates ending in even numbers are restricted to buying gas on even-numbered days.

Drivers with license plates ending in letters or other characters must buy their gas on odd-numbered days. Which areas are impacted?The measures introduced by Mayor Bloomberg impact all of New York City and Long Island.

In New Jersey, Gov. Christie has introduced similar measures, although drivers are also limited to buying 10 gallons at a time.What vehicles are exempt?Taxis, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, buses and cars with medical plates.When was the last time fuel was rationed?The last time fuel was rationed in New York was the Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s.Is rationing working?It is early days, but lines were reportedly shorter this morning.

Can I get gas at any station?Only a quarter of the city's gas stations are currently open, so be prepared to drive around until you find one. A long line outside is a good indicator that a station has gas.

Officials said rationing was imposed 
because something had to be done to ease the long waits for fuel which, 
they say, has caused panic-buying and hoarding.

'This is designed to let everybody 
have a fair chance, so the lines aren't too oppressive and that we can 
get through this,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Thursday.

The law is designed to help mitigate the city's gas shortage after Hurricane Sandy swept through the northeast and damaged the petroleum infrastructure in the region.

Long lines at gas stations have been backing up traffic for hours in the wake of the storm.

Mayor Bloomberg tweeted: 'This is not a step we take lightly'

'Last
week’s storm hit the fuel network hard and knocked out critical 
infrastructure needed to distribute gasoline,' Bloomberg said. 'Even as 
the region’s petroleum infrastructure slowly returns to normal, the 
gasoline supply remains a real problem for thousands of New York 
drivers.'

He described the emergency order as the best way to cut down the lines and help customers buy gas faster.

Out-of-state drivers are also subject to the system and Mayor Bloomberg said the shortages could last another couple of weeks. 

The temporary law is similar to the 
one that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie recently implemented in his 
state, as New Jersey drivers faced similar shortages in the aftermath of
Sandy. Christie also limited gas purchases to 10 gallons per driver.

'This is not a step we take lightly,'
Bloomberg tweeted, 'But given gas shortages and the growing 
frustrations of NYers, we believe it’s the right step.'

FEMA
has tried to assist the region by shipping gasoline to stations in the 
hard-hit areas of the Northeast and at one point the federal agency 
offered $10 in free gas to consumers.

But the free gas ended up causing further problems for police.

Police
made several arrests in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn 
recently after people jumped ahead of the thousands of otherwise patient
drivers waiting in line to fill their tanks.

City
officials were hoping the situation would ease after the New York 
Harbor re-opened, allowing for more bulk delivers of millions of gallons
of gas. But the long lines at gas stations have persisted as the city 
struggles to get back on its feet.

The long lines and frayed nerves at gas stations in New York and New Jersey has revived memories for some of the crippling Arab oil embargo of 1973, the last time that gasoline was rationed in New York.

That crisis started in October 1973, when the Arab oil-producing states imposed an embargo against nations supporting Israel in the Fourth Arab-Israeli War, also known as Yom Kippur.

The oil embargo, and the cut in production that accompanied it, doubled the price of crude and reduced overall supply.

That forced gasoline prices to skyrocket at the pump and led to rationing and prompted Washington to question its reliance on Arab oil in a region known for its instability.

Long gas station lines and frustrated motorists became iconic images of the early 1970s. The embargo eventually end in March 1974.
