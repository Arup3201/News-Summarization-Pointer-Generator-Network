Aston Villa striker Andreas Weimann has vowed to win his Austria place back after being axed for the first time in two years.

The striker has been dropped for their opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Sweden on Monday.

Coach Marcel Koller opted to give 1860 Munich striker Rubin Okotie his first call-up in five years and leave Weimann at home.

But the 23-year-old, who scored his second of the season in Villa's 2-1 Barclays Premier League win over Hull last weekend, insists he will work to reclaim his spot.

He said: 'I am only on standby. I would have liked to go but the manager has tried to change it. I've been called up for the last two years every time but he just wanted to change it so I've got to keep going.

'He called me and said he thought for this game - we are playing Sweden - another player would be better suited. I've got to accept it and keep playing well here.'

Weimann's omission leaves Stoke's Marko Arnautovic as the only Premier League-based player in Koller's squad.

Villa's Weimann has 11 caps but is yet to score for his country since making his debut in 2012.

Goal shy: Weimann is Villa's top scorer this season with two goals but he has never netted for Austria

He is Villa's top scorer with two goals in four games in an impressive start for Paul Lambert's side.

They have seven points from their first three games as Lambert begins to blood midfielder Jack Grealish.

The 18-year-old has come through the club's academy and is expected to make an impact on the first team this season.

He has played for the Ireland Under 21 side but is still eligible for England and is yet to decide which country to play for.

'I think he's a really good footballer,' Weimann told the Birmingham Mail. 'In pre-season he has been heavily involved with us, he has done really well. He came on against Stoke and didn't look out of place at all. He has been going well.

'He is quite confident. On the pitch, he is definitely confident. Off the pitch he likes to talk. He talks to you, he gets on with everyone and everyone has helped him when he's needed it.'
