A Connecticut father-of-four is accused of murdering his estranged wife and wounding her mother today - one month after posting a heartbroken message on Facebook about the breakup of their marriage when he caught her in bed with another man.

Lori Gellatly, 32, had fled the home she shared with husband Scott Gellatly, 46, and moved into her mother's house in Oxford, Connecticut, taking the couple's 18-month-old twins with her.

About 5.45am Wednesday, Gellatly broke into the house, seeking revenge, police say. He shot his estranged wife and her mother, Merry Jackson. The twins, who were home at the time, were not injured.

'I hear (the neighbor) say I miss doing this with you,' Gellatly writes. 'He said we have to get to get together.'

In his rambling post he wrote: 'I don't get y some that believe s that they have a great family and would jeperdise something so sweet and betufle.' (sic)
