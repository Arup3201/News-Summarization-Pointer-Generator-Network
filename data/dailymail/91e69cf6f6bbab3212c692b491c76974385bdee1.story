The mother of two children who were living periodically in a 5-by-10-foot unit at a New Jersey storage facility has been sentenced to probation.

The 28-year-old Ewing woman received 4 years' probation under an agreement in which she agreed to plead guilty to child abuse and contempt charges.

Johnson initially was charged with child endangerment after her sons, then ages 5 and 10, were found in the storage facility last April. Officers checked the facility after she was arrested for slashing her ex-boyfriend's tires.

Johnson thanked the judge for giving her a second chance.

Johnson, who is now trying to regain custody of the sons, said domestic conflict caused her to lose her job and then the roof over her head at a time when she was also dealing with one son’s severe ADHD.

'I am encouraged by your decisions and I think they are appropriate,' said Johnson, who appeared before the judge in a black suit with matching hose and heels. Johnson, who benefited from a community fund-raiser after her situation came to light, said she is now working with an agency trying to help other women in desperate situations.

Her children remain in foster care. She gets supervised visits with them 
and says she plans to regain custody as soon as possible.

She was found along with her two young children living in a filthy five-by-ten-foot storage unit in New Jersey.

Johnson
 told a court last May she was so desperate, she had no other choice but
 to move her sons into the sealed container with no running water or 
electricity.

The horrific discovery was made last April when Johnson was arrested for allegedly slashing her ex-boyfriend's tires.

That's when she confessed to officers that her boys were in the storage unit on their own.

Police found the children in deplorable conditions, sleeping on a bare mattress surrounded by garbage bags filled with clothes, a suitcase, a backpack and other items strewn around the locker.

Johnson explained to the court she was forced to move into the storage unit after losing her job in December 2012 and breaking up with her fiance due to domestic abuse.

She went to live with a relative who later pushed her out of the house and locked the door with her children inside during one argument, she told Mercer County Correction Center.

She had to call police to get the door open and she then took the children and their few possessions and went to a hotel.

After this, in February 2013, the family had been moving as transients from charity hotel to borrowed beds at friend’s houses, finding places to sleep for a few days at a time.

But as money ran low and she was denied more benefits from the county, she said she simply ran out of options.

The Homeless Hotline gave the family a room at the Mount’s Motel in Lawrence for three nights.

After that, the nights in the storage locker began.

'It really hit me so hard, that I’m down at about the tree-root’s-bottom, and what can I do to make my kids’ life better this way.

'I didn’t see any clarity — our only option was to stay where our stuff is.

'We all hugged and we all slept on the same mattress when we were there. We made it. I didn’t make it seem as if it was the worst situation ever.'

She said though it was cold, it wasn't freezing and she heaped blankets over the boys to keep them warm.

She would eat in fast-food restaurants for breakfast and the boys would brush their teeth and wash up there. Sometimes they stayed at a friend's house and were able to have showers or watch TV.

At the same time she was making sure her boys were going to school.

It was over this that she and her ex-fiance argued after she asked him to give the youngest son a ride to school that morning. When he refused, she got angry and slashed his tires.

Johnson had left the boys in the storage unit and told them she would be back soon.

It was the last time she saw them.

She also revealed in court that she has few friends in the area and grew up under drug-addicted parents. She was working by aged 14 and pregnant by 16.

The boys, aged five and ten, were reportedly taken for check ups at the Capital Health Regional Medical Center (pictured) before being released in the care of social services

A unit that size at the Ewing location costs up to $70 a month, according to its website.

A renter of another unit said he believed the family had been living there 'for months'.

There is no heat inside the units and only the hallways are wired for electricity, he said.

Flo Auletta, who owns a restaurant across the road from the storage company told the Trentonian that paramedics, code enforcement officials and social workers subsequently arrived on the scene.

Ewing Mayor Bert Steinmann told the paper that the discovery had left him 'shocked and appalled' and said he had called the town's two other storage companies to check there was nothing similar occurring.

'I just wished the mother would have sought help instead of going down the route she took,' he added.

'There’s Homefront, the County’s Board of Social Services, Women’s Space — anything would have been better.'
