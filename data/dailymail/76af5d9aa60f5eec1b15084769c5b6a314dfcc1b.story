Supermarkets have announced fuel-price cuts ahead of the August bank holiday getaway.

Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are all reducing the cost of their petrol by up to 2p a litre, with diesel going down by 1p a litre.

In Asda’s case, this will take the price of its petrol to no more than 124.7p a litre, with diesel at 128.7p for diesel - its lowest prices since January 2011.

The move by three of the biggest supermarkets will bring some relief for drivers who have seen pump prices inch up in recent weeks

The average UK price of petrol was 129.71p a litre, with diesel at 133.74p - its lowest since mid-February 2011, yesterday according to the AA. 

Unlike Asda, other supermarkets are not implementing a national cap so prices could vary regionally. 

Morrison's is one of the few that hasn't promised a reduction, with a spokesman saying the supermarket will 'be evaluating' prices to 'remain competitive'. 

An AA spokesman said: 'We have seen competitive independent retailers east of London selling petrol as low as 125.9p a litre recently.'

RAC fuel spokesman Pete Williams said: 'We’ve been calling for petrol and diesel prices to fall for some time following the decrease in wholesale prices and so this is a welcome move by the supermarkets. 

'We would expect to see other retailers to follow in the coming days giving consumers a great opportunity to fuel up ahead of the bank holiday.'

Asda, which claims to offer the cheapest fuel all year round, said released a statement crediting the strength of the pound for the slash in prices. 

The cost of filling up has almost doubled in a decade, with average prices of around 80p per litre in July 2004

A spokesman said: 'We’re giving our customers and holiday makers the opportunity to fill up their cars with some of the cheapest fuel prices in the market for years, putting much needed cash back in their pockets as the summer holidays begin. 

'A full tank of fuel now costs £5 less than last summer and our national price cap benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.'
