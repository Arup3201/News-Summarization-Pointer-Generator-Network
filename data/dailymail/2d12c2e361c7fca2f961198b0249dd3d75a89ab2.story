Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam risked upstaging her husband on the third day of the Liberal Democrat conference.

Everywhere the Deputy Prime Minister went yesterday people seemed more interested in his wife than his latest pronouncements on tax and spending, including at a Q&A session where photographers and most eyes in the room appeared fixed on the successful lawyer - not her husband.

In fact it had been the couple's 12th wedding anniversary, but instead of a night away or a romantic meal cooked by the DPM, lucky Miriam was spending it with Lib Dem politicians and delegates at the party's celebrated 'Welsh night' in Brighton.

And to make it worse Sky News host Eamonn Holmes ended 
an interview on live television by remarking on Miriam’s appearance, to 
the obvious discomfort of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Miriam Gonzalez Durantez was in the audience yesterday for her husband's Q&A session, but has now returned to London

‘Congratulations on your long lasting marriage. May I just say you have a very attractive wife,’ Mr Holmes said as Mr Clegg squirmed, replying: 'I think she will be very flattered by that. I think so.'

Carrying on regardless Mr Holmes then said: 'I think he blushed at that,' and the DPM tried to end the conversation by saying simply: 'Yes'.

After Mr Clegg was off screen the presenter continued the conversation with his colleague.

'She is on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, a very good picture - very good.'

Viewers were surprised by the question, after a long discussion about Mr Clegg's tax plans and tuition fees apology.

A source close to Mr Clegg said he was unfazed by the comment, but added: 'It was not your traditional question for an early morning tour of the TV studios.’

But Mr Holmes wasn't the only man with his mind on Miriam.

In his Monday newspaper column Boris Johnson hailed her as one of
the 20 reasons to defend Mr Clegg - in a piece entitled 'we've got to save the Cleggster.

Ranking her as reason number eight, he declared: ‘Miriam González 
Durántez, is every bit as lovely and clever and funny as she appears.'

Without a major appearance in the 
conference hall, Mr Clegg had instead been wracking up photo 
opportunities – though without Miriam by his side.

She had returned to London to look after the couple’s three children.

Touring the trade stands in the Brighton conference centre, he had a go at a steady hand game – successfully completing the buzzer toy run by the Parkinson’s Society.

He later posed to have his picture taken on the Royal Mail stand.

Earlier on a visit to an engineering firm in Brighton with Vince Cable, Mr Clegg brushed aside the support of the London Mayor who used his Daily Telegraph column to set out 20 reasons why everyone, and not just Conservatives, should be grateful help Mr Clegg to survive.

Mr Johnson said the Lib Dem had ‘laid down his political life’ to form a government, even if that meant being attacked from all sides and suffering a ‘protracted political humiliation’.

The London Mayor declared: ‘Never mind the badgers – save the Cleggster from extermination!’

But Mr Clegg insisted he would not be taking tips from Mr Johnson: ‘Boris is the nation's greatest celebrity politician and he is much held aloft by the people of London.

‘He is an extremely amusing writer but I don't think I will be taking my guide from Boris about my own future.’
