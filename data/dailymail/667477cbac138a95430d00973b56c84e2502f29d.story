Make no mistake. A first trophy as Celtic manager was a huge, significant step for Ronny Deila. He took the old cup from Rod Stewart, skipped down the Hampden steps and refused to let go until the ‘Ronny Roar’ — his ceremonial bonding session with the club’s supporters.

But this was a day when sobriety was the Parkhead watchword. Sober reflection, followed by a sober celebration.

Celtic’s first League Cup since 2009 is the platform for Deila to become only the third Celtic boss to win a domestic Treble. But that’s it. A piece in the jigsaw, no more.

A Scottish Cup replay against Dundee United — who else? — beckons on Wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of Glasgow’s fast-food outlets cashing in on a Celtic team session last night. The players, captain Scott Brown included, were under orders to be in bed by midnight.

‘We should enjoy the moment,’ said a relieved Deila after an eventful, if unremarkable, final. ‘But there is not going to be any nightlife.’

We should have known Brown would be a key figure here again. The Celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards – both rescinded – when these teams met at Tannadice last week. His manager then overlooked the front-page pictures of a night of rabble-rousing in Edinburgh before the final.

Yet the greatest let-off of all might have been here when referee Bobby Madden denied United – who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick.

Celtic were ahead at the time. They had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper Sean Dillon collided with Virgil van Dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches. He was gone for fully eight minutes.

‘I was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long,’ said manager Jackie McNamara afterwards. ‘It proved costly for us.

‘I had Blair Spittal ready to come on and I was going to put Ryan McGowan to right-back. Unfortunately, I don’t have a magic wand for those circumstances.’

Dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes. Thereafter, Celtic dominated, scoring again through James Forrest and emphasising why the Tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment.

He wasn’t to blame for the insipid Paul Dixon free-kick which allowed Craig Gordon to gather and trigger a Celtic counter.

But it was from his position that Anthony Stokes – who had a fine game - chipped a left-foot cross that was prodded towards goal by Kris Commons, changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of Jaroslaw Fojut.

Somehow Rado Cierzniak in the United goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post, but Commons would not be denied, thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1-0.

‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing,’ pondered McNamara. ‘If we had scored from that Dixon free-kick, everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time.’

There was more cause for United regret in 36 minutes when Ryan Dow, chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by Brown, a villainous figure through Tannadice eyes.

Referee Madden had a good, long look then decided to turn the other way. Brown had ducked SFA punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another Tannadice gripe against authority. Not without justification, it should be said.

Predictably, Deila – perhaps seeing it through green and white shades – saw things differently.

‘It was hard to say, but, from what I have been told, it was a good decision,’ he claimed. ‘I think the referee was very good. We are after him whenever he does something wrong, but you have to give them credit when they do a good job.’

In contrast, United foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes.

Last Sunday, Paul Paton and Dixon were sent packing. Paton’s proved to be a nonsense, but Dillon’s here was inarguable.

The defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on Izaguirre. The Honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury.

On the United touchline McNamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all. His side had lost the Scottish Cup Final against St Johnstone last May and they knew, now, another showpiece occasion was slipping away.

Celtic’s extra man was telling.

In Stokes, Stefan Johansen and Nir Bitton, they had the best players on the pitch.

In 67 minutes, Johansen got across Fojut to jab a Leigh Griffiths cross towards goal, the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow United escape.

It was the last act for Griffiths before he made way for John Guidetti. James Forrest replaced the tiring Commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact.

Forrest and Guidetti started brightly enough, the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the Swede teed up a Johansen cut-back.

Their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time.

Referee Madden showed no hesitation when Forrest was pulled back by Dixon.

‘He was very quick to point to the spot that time,’ said a caustic McNamara afterwards.

Forrest grabbed the ball, resisting Guidetti’s determined and very vocal efforts to do the same.

The winger placed the ball down, then placed a weak effort too close to Cierzniak, the United keeper preventing a third goal.

An unimpressed Deila explained afterwards: ‘Both of the players who were going to take a penalty, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons, were off the park. It looks like it was the first to the ball, but I don’t like that they argue about that. 

Forrest earned Celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from Dundee United's Paul Dixon in the closing stages

Several Celtic players wanted Guidetti to take the spot-kick but Forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty

‘It is stupid. That is not the team spirit I want.’

As the final whistle signalled a significant day for the Norwegian, Guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff, clearly furious. He was retrieved by Mikael Lustig, possibly on Deila’s orders.

‘There is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers, especially, want to score goals,’ he continued. ‘Again, we have to put the team in front of ourselves. It is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience. This is not team spirit. It is individual thinking - and I don’t want anything to do with that.’

Collectively, Celtic have much to excite them. A Treble hovers on the horizon. The late night celebrations can wait.
