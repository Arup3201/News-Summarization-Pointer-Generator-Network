A pensioner took his mobility scooter for a perilous trip when he was filmed going the wrong way down the hard shoulder on the motorway.

Shocked motorists spotted the 85-year-old  man heading south on the northbound carriageway of the M1 in South Yorkshire.

The man, who escaped without injury, was escorted from the scene by a police motorcyclist who slowed down traffic to prevent a possible accident.

The unnamed pensioner was travelling southbound along the northbound carriageway of the M1 in his mobility scooter after making his way onto the busy motorway just south of Rotherham in Yorkshire

Steve Saxon was a passenger in a lorry heading north when he took out his camera phone and filmed the incident from the cab. 

Mr Saxon, owner of Pontefract-based S. E. Saxon Transport, said: 'I've been driving lorries since 1986 and I don't think I've ever seen anything quite as bizarre as that. I don't think I ever will again.'

He continued: 'I don't know where he thought he was off to, but he clearly hadn't got there yet. He had no shopping in his basket.

'It was hilarious at first. We were gobsmacked and I couldn't stop laughing and then I realised it wasn't actually that funny.

'The traffic slowed down and we saw him being taken off by a police motorbike.

'How he managed to get on there in the first place I don't know!'

Police slowed down traffic to prevent an accident as they escorted the pensioner to safety 

He added: 'The chap must have been in his late 70s or 80s.

'He was steering with one hand and looked completely unfazed. We just keep watching it back and laughing to ourselves.'

A police spokeswoman confirmed that the force had received a number of calls about the 85-year-old mobility scooter rider's progress down the hard shoulder and said that his family had been contacted following the incident.

Andy Foster, who delivers mobility scooter training at South Yorkshire Polices Lifewise Centre at Hellaby, is pushing for obligatory training for anyone who buys a mobility scooter.

The safety expert, who recently featured in the BBC television series The Trouble With Mobility Scooters, said: 'Very few people that ride mobility scooters have any knowledge of the laws of the roads.

'They don't need to hold a driving licence or have insurance. This man needs to thank his lucky stars he was stopped when he did.'

The 85-year-old man joined the M1 at Junction 32 and was heading southbound to Junction 31 when he was spotted by motorists
