Hit TV series Game of Thrones generated more than £8.6 million worth of publicity for Northern Ireland this year, tourism bosses have revealed.

Executives at Tourism Ireland were quick to capitalise on the global success of the HBO series, much of which is filmed on location in the region.

They launched an 11-week international marketing campaign in April this year after HBO allowed the programme’s name and logo to be used in the tourism campaign.

It was unrolled on Twitter and Facebook in North America and Europe, including Great Britain, United States, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, and was aimed at targeting the show’s 14m viewers.

It ran for just 11 weeks between April and June this year and received 100million hits online.

Despite costing just £200,000 to create, executives say that reaching such a large audience would normally have cost almost £9million, making it Tourism Ireland's most successful ever campaign.

As well as the Titanic Studios in Belfast, locations including the Cushendun caves, Murlough Bay, Ballintoy Harbour, and Larrybane have all provided backdrops for the drama.

Tourism Ireland hope the success of the advertising push will increase overseas visitor numbers to more than two million a year by 2016 and generate more than £550 million for the local economy.

Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said: ‘The campaign cost us £200,000. If we were to buy the publicity, that would have cost us £8.6 million.

‘It was the most successful Twitter campaign that we have ever run - and we have run a lot of them.

‘It allowed us to sell Northern Ireland to an audience who wouldn't have heard of it before.’

Game of Thrones has been shot in a variety of locations including Morocco, Iceland, Malta and Croatia.

However, the majority of filming took place in Northern Ireland, where the rugged landscape provided a stunning scenic backdrop.

The series has thrown the spotlight on beauty spots such as the Dark Hedges and Ballintoy harbour in north Antrim as well as Castle Ward in Co Down.

Game of Thrones is one of a number of large-scale productions to have been filmed in Northern Ireland over the past decade. Others include Dracula Untold and the BBC drama series The Fall.

Mr Gibbons said the organisation had ambitious plans to promote Northern Ireland as a must-see destination.

He added: ‘Following a successful 2014, ambitious targets have been set for 2015.

‘We will continue to highlight iconic experiences all over Northern Ireland, including Titanic Belfast, the Giant's Causeway and our unique National Trust properties.

‘The Causeway Coastal Route and driving holidays to Northern Ireland will also be promoted widely.

‘Next year we will be working hard to maximise tourism potential of the Irish Open at Royal County Down and the return of the Tall Ships to Belfast, as well as the opening up of the Gobbins cliff path. We will continue to target people of Ulster-Scots descent; and to promote Northern Ireland as a top golf destination.’

Meanwhile, Brian Ambrose, chairman of Tourism Ireland, said although there was still a nervousness among some about travelling to Belfast, feedback was positive.

He said: ‘For first time visitors there is a nervousness about coming, they are not quite sure what things will be like when they get here. 

'But the best form of advertising is word of mouth, so people come and enjoy the experience.

‘As far as the feedback is concerned, the experience generally exceeds expectations, which is a good place to be.'
