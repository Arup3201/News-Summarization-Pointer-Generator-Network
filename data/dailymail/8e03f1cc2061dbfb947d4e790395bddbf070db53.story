They even stole my underpants,’ says Victor Wanyama, shaking his head. He is discussing the recent burglary at his Winchester home. ‘There are some strange people around,’ he says. ‘They took everything. My car, jewellery, three televisions, clothes, shoes.

‘I had champagne bottles in cases which were my man-of-the-match awards. They left the glass case and took the champagne. My car was found the next day but the most important things were my shirts, one from Andres Iniesta and the other from Paul Pogba. They are still missing.’

Understandably, the events have left Wanyama feeling uneasy. He is not the only Southampton player to be affected. Jose Fonte, Nathaniel Clyne and Emmanuel Mayuka have all fallen victim to break-ins.

YAYA TOURE: Yaya has everything. He has power, strength, physique but he also has a velvet touch on the ball. He can make a terrific pass.

ALEXIS SANCHEZ: Alexis dances like a snake, the way he moves. You have to be careful timing your tackles, it’s difficult to get the ball. 

SERGIO AGUERO: I like the look of Diego Costa at Chelsea, the way he roughs up defenders, but Aguero is strong and a deadly finisher.

The Kenyan has moved temporarily to a nearby hotel while his house is fitted with new alarms.

‘I need somewhere to feel safe and relaxed to concentrate on my game. Home doesn’t feel like home right now.’

The 23-year-old is polite and softly spoken. He is frustrated though following the previous night’s defeat at Arsenal. It has been a tough week, the 1-0 loss at The Emirates followed a 3-0 defeat by Manchester City and Monday brings another acid test of their top-four credentials when they host Manchester United, the club Wanyama supported as a boy.

‘We feel we deserve to be where we are,’ says Wanyama on Southampton’s lofty league position. ‘The squad is stronger than last season. Our losses have come down to individual errors and not being clinical with our chances. That’s the difference with the top sides.

‘City are the champions but they set out to defend against us because they know we keep possession well but they were deadly with their chances. At Arsenal we were unlucky, they have a magician in Alexis Sanchez and we were down to 10 men at a crucial time.

‘We deserve to be where we are. We have a few injuries too but we know we have to keep working to stay in the top four.’

Despite off-field problems, Wanyama (below) has played a key role in Southampton's great start to the season

Wanyama has already starred in the Champions League at Celtic. His performances, including a goal in their famous 2-1 win over Barcelona in November 2012, helped earn his £12.5million move to Southampton 18 months ago. The younger Southampton players quiz him about what it was like.

‘James Ward-Prowse and Jack Cork ask me about the games,’ he says. ‘Barcelona was the highlight of my career so far. I tell them how fantastic it was and how great the atmosphere was. It is the best club competition in the world.

‘It means so much to players. Some Barcelona players like Xavi and Iniesta came to me and said “well played” but Dani Alves was screaming how we had only defended and cheated them and Jordi Alba was in tears.’

Beating a resurgent Manchester United on Monday would go some way to reaffirming Southampton as Champions League contenders.

United are a team he relishes facing. Growing up in Nairobi, he dreamed of playing for them and it is a dream he still harbours. ‘My father Noah was a footballer and he used to talk as if he knew everything,’ he laughs. ‘He used to say “when you’ve been a footballer you can talk to me’’ so I thought that’s what I’ll become. It drove me.

‘United were my team. When their games were on we used to go to an old theatre where you had to pay to watch movies and then extra for United games. Sometimes they would stop the movies to show United’s match.

‘I had posters of Roy Keane and Paul Scholes on my wall. They were my favourite players who I wanted to be. If I could take anything from them maybe it would be Keane’s passion, his fire. I wanted to shake his hand after we played Aston Villa the other week but I didn’t find him. It’s a shame he has left.’

Today Wanyama holds up Wayne Rooney as his favourite United player. ‘He is the best English player. He is strong, powerful, he has that anger that drives his team. He lifts them, sometimes carries them. The type of guy you would always want on your side.’

Wanyama feels comfortable rubbing shoulders with such illustrious company now. ‘I’m confident but never relaxed. You can’t be relaxed in the Premier League, there are too many teams who can trip you up, too many strong players.’

He credits his former Celtic manager Neil Lennon for making him more streetwise, while Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman have helped him refine a reputation as one of the Premier League’s most consistent midfielders. His performances have drawn admiring glances and he is not short of aspirations.

‘I want to play in the Champions League again, it is the pinnacle for every player,’ he says. ‘Can I do it with Southampton? We are good enough. Why not?’

Wanyama was also full of praise for  Ronald Koeman for helping him produce more consistent displays
