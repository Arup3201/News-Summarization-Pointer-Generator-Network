A depressed student fed-up with his non-existent sex life tried to kill himself by jumping from a building – but ended up landing in a tree and being left dangling by his foot.

Ilya Gocharov, 25, from the city of Chelyabinsk in southern Russia, had decided to take his own life after failing to have sex for over a year since his long-term girlfriend dumped him for someone else.

But after jumping out of a fifth floor balcony he landed in a tree and got tangled upside down in the branches, before passers-by heard his cries for help and called the police.

A police officer gapes at Ilya Gocharov as the depressed student hangs from a tree branch

In trying to kill himself he plunged five floors from the balcony of an apartment block 

An officer had to jump onto the roof of a police van to help the 25-year-old get down safely

He was filmed dangling from the tree branch around 10ft above the snow-covered ground, before a police van pulled up and an officer clambered onto the roof to help him down.

He was then shoved into the vehicle to warm up, but wasn't at all grateful for being rescued, according to the the officers. 

A police spokesman said: 'When officers arrived they found him hanging from his foot in the tree. He was unable to get free on his own.

'They asked him if he was OK and then managed to get him down.

'He had minor bruises and abrasions but apart from that seemed OK, apart from being a bit angry.

'He said he had a pain in the heel of his foot and when the officers suggested he go to hospital he refused and walked off without even saying thank you.'

Pal Igor Woronoff, 25, said: 'He was very upset about the break-up with his girlfriend and I don't think he really got over it.

'He has now agreed to go to counselling organised by the college who insisted he get treatment after being notified about the incident by police.

'I'm just glad that tree was in the way when he jumped off the balcony.'

Gocharov was not at all grateful for being rescued, according to the officers who came to his aid 

Police were left baffled by the student's actions as he sought to end his life over his lack of sex

It's not what the van is usually used for but on this occasion it was just right for the job

Gocharov was bundled into the van afterwards to kelp him keep warm in the freezing Russian cold

But he didn't stay long, reportedly walking off without saying thank you to his rescuers
