Barred: The popular black cat plays with staff at the Stratford sorting office, but bosses want the animal out

A stray cat adopted by posties is to be evicted because Royal Mail bosses believe it breaches health and safety guidelines to have an animal on the premises.

The black Tom has visited Stratford-upon-Avon's sorting office every day for the past five years, putting a smile on the 
faces of staff - just like Postman Pat and his beloved companion 
Jess.

He has been adopted by 100 staff but is facing a workplace ban after managers ruled he was a risk, adding it was not 'ideal' having a cat around

Royal Mail staff have fed and cared for him since 2008 and say the feline, who they just call 'Cat', has become part of the team.

Almost 1,000 people have joined a Facebook group called 'Save Our Cat' 
in less than a week, and inspired on Twitter, withÂ  
#savethestratfordcat trending.

A postman who has worked there for 13 years, who wanted to remain anonymous 'because we could probably lose our jobs for this', said: 'We can't see the reason why he has to go because he doesn't harm anyone. It's pathetic. It is a pointless exercise, why are they trying to do it?'

Another worker, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'The area manager came in and said "the cat has to go for health and safety reasons".

'We are all angry and upset. It is health and safety gone mad. The cat does not do anything wrong. Everyone has a bond with the cat. He is part of the team and the furniture, he has done five years service. He is ours. He gets lots of fuss and cuddles and has even got its own ball and stash of food'.

Friend: The cat, known as 'Cat', is shown here on the sorting office's steps, but he is about to be rehoused

A third staff member added: 'He has been there longer than most of the managers so how can they possibly demand its eviction? He does not get in anyone's way or cause problems, it just sits around. He's here when we open up at 3.30am and he's usually the last to leave at night.

'We are in uproar. It is our cat. It is ludicrous'.

Postwoman San Smith posted on the Facebook page: 'Save the Cat, he was with me through my interview in the chair beside me, please save the cat :)'

Alexander Gibbons, who works at the sorting office, said: 'Postman Pat has a cat on delivery. Together, we will save this poor b*****. Look how cute he is! :)'

Kerry Bambridge, another postal worker, said: 'Save our cat! If it makes a difference ill get the tipex out so he's white too and call him Jess!' (sic)

Relaxed: The popular cat has visited every day for the past five years, and eats and sleeps on the premises as the postal workers love him

Cherylyn Pitcher said: 'It's never Postman Pat without Jess', while Sharon Brown posted: #Come on fellas, we can do this, beat the royal mail nd save the cat' (sic).

Royal Mail confirmed they were looking for a sanctuary that would take in 'Cat' and a transport cage appeared at the depot earlier this week.

A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'Although this stray cat has become a 
regular visitor to the good natured postmen and women in our sorting 
office, we will be speaking to a local animal welfare charity to find a 
suitable permanent loving home for the stray.'

Sad: Despite a campaign by staff and local people, bosses are said to have brought this cat transporter in, ready to move the stray cat on

Home: The cat wanders in freely but Royal Mail want it stopped and the cat moved on as soon as possible

But the employees think the owner lives nearby the depot and say it would be wrong for Royal Mail to re-home the helpless puss.

'We gave him a collar but it was taken off. We tried to find a home for him but he has never wanted to go home,' another said.

Local people have condemned Royal Mail with many saying 'shame on them' over the red-tape madness.

Kado Crocker said: 'What a shame that H/S are getting rid of this cat. Don't they know he could keep vermin down. Also its beneficial too workers so they work better and more relaxedWhat are they going too do with him if he cant be found a home.'
