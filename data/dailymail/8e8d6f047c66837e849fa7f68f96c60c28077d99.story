Thug: Ikramul Hoque, 19, who has been jailed for three years and four months after setting fire to a homeless man's sleeping bag

A teenager who said 'let's set that guy on fire' and laughed as he torched a homeless man's sleeping bag was today jailed for three years.

A court heard that Ikramul Hoque, 19, thought it was funny to set fire to rough sleeper Christopher Bloomfield, who had bedded down for the night in the entrance to Reading Central Library.

Homeless Mr Bloomfield described waking up to the feeling that his 'feet were melting' as he discovered that his sleeping bag and possessions were engulfed in flames.

Sentencing Hoque to three years and four months at a Young Offenders' Institute, Judge Nicholas Wood told him: 'Christopher Bloomfield was a vulnerable, defenceless man.

'Life on the streets must have been difficult and dangerous at the best of times and Mr Bloomfield was entitled to protection.

'He thought the library doorway was a safe refuge, but it wasn't, because of you.

'He woke up to find pain in his feet and his sleeping bag on fire. That must have been terrifying moment. He said his feet felt like they were burning.

'It was your idea, you thought setting fire to the occupant of the sleeping bag was funny and were laughing.'

Autistic Hoque, who also suffers from Tourettes and ADHD, according to his defence, admitted starting the fire but told police he thought it was just a pile of rubbish.

But CCTV images played to the court showed Mr Bloomfield moving around inside the sleeping bag in the entrance of Reading Central Library at around 9.40pm on May 21, last year.

Hoque then walked up to the sleeping tramp, crouched down and lit a corner of his bedding with a cigarette lighter.

As the flames began to spread he fled the scene.

Moments later, Mr Bloomfield awoke in agony and a passer-by who had rushed to his aid helped him to put out the fire. Sandra Beck, prosecuting, said Mr Bloomfield was lucky to have suffered only minor injuries.

Hoque had been out in Reading town centre with friend when he decided to turn arsonist after smoking cannabis and drinking three bottles of lager.

'All I saw was rubbish,' said Hoque at an earlier hearing at Reading Crown Court.

'That's what I thought in my head.

'I was just left there in the middle of nowhere.

'I couldn't see anything, any form or shape of person.'

He tried to defend his actions claiming: 'I was high at the time. I can't remember.'

Hoque pictured with supporters outside Reading Crown Court: He initially denied being in the area but then admitted arson being reckless as to the risk of endangering life. His mother cried as he was led away

At an early hearing Reading Crown Court heard how Hoque walked back to his friend laughing.

Hoque initially denied being in the area but admitted arson being reckless as to the risk of endangering life.

Benjamin Thiele-Long, defending, said Hoque suffered from autism, ADHD and tourettes.

The defendant's mother sobbed in the public gallery at Reading Crown Court as the teenager, from Whitley, near Reading, Berkshire, was led to the cells.

Hoque, who appeared in court wearing a black Puffa jacket, bowed his head as the judge delievered his sentence.

A friend blew a kiss from the public gallery as he was taken away.
