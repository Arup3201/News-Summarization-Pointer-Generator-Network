A 15-year-old Pakistani girl who was 
shot by the Taliban for promoting girls' education has urged Pakistan to
reverse a decision to rename a college in her honor to avert militant 
attacks on students.

An official said today that Malala Yousufzai, who became a symbol 
of youth resistance to the Taliban, made the request after students 
broke into the school, tore down Malala's pictures and boycotted classes
in her home town of Mingora.

They said renaming the college endangered 
their lives.

Senior government official Kamran 
Rehman said Malala called him from London, where she was being treated 
for critical wounds from the attack on October 9.

The Taliban said it 
targeted her for promoting education for secular girls.

Malala's case won worldwide 
recognition for the struggle for women's rights in Pakistan and Taliban 
have vowed to target her again.

Pakistani Taliban have a strong presence in the country's tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.

A bomb ripped through the office of a 
local militant commander Maulvi Abbas in Wana, a main town in the South 
Waziristan tribal region in the northwest, killing him and three of his 
guards, two intelligence officials said Friday.

Abbas was an associate of Hakimullah 
Mehsud, the head of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan militant group, they said,
speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to 
brief reporters.

It was unclear who had planted the 
bomb. The attack came weeks after a suicide bomber in the same town 
attacked Maulvi Nazir, a prominent militant commander who is believed to
have a nonaggression pact with the army.

Nazir was wounded in the attack, and seven of his men were killed.

Since then there has been tension between followers of Nazir and the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan in the region.

Malala is expected to make Britain her permanent home.

Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood welcomed the move saying the family would be surrounded by friends and family in Birmingham.

Malala was attacked by Taliban fighters in Mingora, the main town of Swat Valley, on October 9, as she travelled home from school.

She was struck by a bullet just above her left eye after extremists boarded her school bus - targeting her for demanding education and standing up for childrens' rights.

The bullet travelled down the side of her jaw and damaged her skull, and she was later flown to Britain for treatment.

The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has threatened to target Malala and members of her family, raising questions about whether it would be safe for her to return to Pakistan.
