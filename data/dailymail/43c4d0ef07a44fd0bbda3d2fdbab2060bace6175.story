He has waxed lyrical since her death, calling Baroness Thatcher ‘a model’ and ‘the greatest statesman of the 20th century.’

But despite his overtures, Silvio Berlusconi has still not made final cut for her very last hurrah.

The former Italian premier was intent on appearing at the funeral with world leaders next week, and has been lobbying hard behind the scenes for the invitation.

There were ‘numerous and insistent’ phone calls to the Italian embassy in London, according to the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano.

He even dispatched an envoy, his right-hand man Gianni Letta, to petition the embassy on his behalf.

But to no avail.

Acting prime minister Mario Monti, a technocrat who is unlikely to cause embarrassment, is to be Italy’s representative.

Downing Street confirmed that each country was only allocated one diplomatic invitation.

‘It is up to the individual countries to decide who they want to send,’ a spokesman said.

‘Of course there may be other invitations to Italians but they are personal, chosen by the family.’

The snub is likely to have caused great offence to the billionaire politician, a huge fan of Baroness Thatcher’s.

On Monday he said he had been ‘honoured by her friendship and esteem.’

In fact Baroness Thatcher was one of Berlusconi’s staunch defenders.

As corruption charges mounted against him she had insisted that he was the victim of ‘character assassination’.

In government we had ‘very similar goals’, she said.

Ever coarse, Berlusconi had responded by saying - in Neapolitan slang - that the former Conservative leader was ‘a hot piece of ass’.

Berlusconi is report to have kept a picture of Baroness Thatcher on his desk and is said to have once missed his daughter's birthday party to have dinner with her.

But in 2008, he reportedly snubbed the Iron Lady when he was supposed to be the guest of honour at a dinner thrown in Italy for the Baroness, but failed to turn up.
