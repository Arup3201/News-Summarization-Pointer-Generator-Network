Listening to Mozart can significantly help to focus the mind and improve brain performance, according to new research.

A study found that listening to a minuet - a specific style of classical dance music - composed by Mozart increased the ability of both young and elderly people to concentrate and complete a task.

Scientists say that the findings help to prove that music plays a crucial role in human brain development.

Are headphoneS the ultimate study aid? Japanese and American scientists have discovered that Mozart's harmonious melodies help to focus the mind and prevent distraction when carrying out a task

‘Music evolved for helping to overcome 
the predicament of stress that arises from holding contradictory 
cognitions so that knowledge 
is not discarded but rather can be accumulated, and human culture can 
evolve,' wrote Professor Nobuo Masataka of Japan’s Kyoto University and Dr Leonard Perlovsky of Harvard University, who led the research.

Researchers took 25 boys, aged between eight and nine as well as 25 older people aged between ages 65 to 75, and made them complete a version of a Stroop task.

The Stroop task is a famous test used to investigate a person's mental performance and involves asking the participant to identify the colour of words. The challenge is managing to identify the correct colour when the word spells out a different colour.

Many have described the benefits that the composer's music has on the brain as the 'Mozart Effect'

As the series of words flash before the participants on a computer screen, they must identify each colour and ignore the word that the letters spell out.

For example, the word ‘red’ could be written in the colour blue but the participant must say the word 'red'.

The test was carried out three times. Once while a Mozart minuet played in the background, once with a modified version of the same music with dissonant (irregular and unpleasant) intervals, and a third time in complete silence.

The findings were consistent for both the younger and older participants.

Both age groups were able to identify the correct colours quicker and with less errors when listening to the original Mozart music.

When dissonant music played, reaction times became significantly slower and there was a much higher rate or mistakes.

Scientists said that the brain’s natural dislike of dissonant music and the high success rate of  the flowing, consonant (harmonious) music of Mozart indicate the important effect of music on cognitive function. 

It also showed that consonant music could help come people ignore distractions, they added.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's is universally described as complex, melodically beautiful and rich in harmony and texture.

The Austrian composer, keyboard player, violinist, violist, and conductor died at the age of 35, and left behind more than 600 pieces.

Previous studies have found that his compositions provide cognitive benefits and scientists have referred to this as the 'Mozart Effect'.
