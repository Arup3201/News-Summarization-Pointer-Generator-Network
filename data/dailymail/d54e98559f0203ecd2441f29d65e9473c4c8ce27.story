A drug addict lesbian couple left a retired bus conductor to slowly die after torturing him for his PIN number, a court heard.

Kelly Louise Barnes, 32, and Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, 31, are accused of targeting Barry Reeve, 67, at his home in Norwich, believing he had a secret stash of money.

They beat him and cut him with a knife before leaving him dying and prosecutors allege they turned the volume on Mr Reeve’s television up in an attempt to mask his screams.

Mr Reeve, known as Titch because of his small stature, is thought to have remained alive until at least the following morning.

The attackers returned to his terraced house in the city’s Corton Road later that evening and striped it of anything of value, including food from the freezer.

Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC told the jury Mr Reeve’s body was discovered two weeks after the attack on February 9 last year when his daughter called at the blood-spattered property.

Describing the alleged attack, Mr Khalil said: 'He was brutally beaten, cut with a sharp blade and left to die in his home, unable to summon help.

'It is a sad fact that he was not found until two weeks later when his daughter, Julie Reeve, called round.

'She found the back door unlocked, opened it and saw blood on the inner door. She could not bear to go in any further and called on a neighbour.

'Together they went back, called for him but got no answer and decided to call the emergency services.'

Kelly Louise Barnes and Jodie Barnes, both of Bixley Close, Norwich, who were in a civil partnership together, deny murder.

A post-mortem examination showed that Mr Reeve was alive for between 15 and 48 hours after suffering brain injuries.

Mr Khalil said the couple had injured him in 'varied and awful ways’.

He said: 'His injuries reveal that whilst he was still alive he was beaten savagely and that he was scored with a sharp blade to his face and torso in a manner akin to torture. He must have suffered dreadfully.

'Both of these defendants went to his home uninvited. He was alive when they arrived and was left dying when they departed.

'They were so callous that they later returned to his home in a taxi and cleared out what items they wanted, including foodstuffs from his freezer.’

Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but was heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash, the court heard.

The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.
