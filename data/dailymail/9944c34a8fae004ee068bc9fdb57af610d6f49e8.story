Thibaut Courtois does not know what his future holds as he waits to find out what plans Chelsea have for him.

The Belgium goalkeeper has been on loan at Atletico Madrid for the three seasons since Chelsea signed him, but the clamour for him to return to London has been getting louder.

The 22-year-old has earned himself a reputation as one of the best keepers in the world during his time with Atleti and, on Saturday, was part of the side which won the Primera Division title in dramatic fashion.

When Courtois was sent to Madrid he was considered to be a long way behind Petr Cech in the pecking order, but many now consider him to be better than Chelsea's long-standing custodian.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho said last week he has made his mind up about Courtois and will make the decision known soon, but the player himself has no idea where he will be next season.

Speaking to the Guardian he said: "It's a great feeling to be champion of Spain. I am not sure yet what happens next season.

'We have the Champions League final [on Saturday] and then the World Cup, so now is not the time to think of the future. I have two years contract [left] with Chelsea, so we will see.

Top dog: If Courtois returns to Stamford Bridge, he will compete with current number one Petr Cech in goal

'If I move somewhere, I will play. With my age, what I want, the most important thing for me, is to play.

'We will see what happens. But Petr is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, he won the golden glove in the Premier League, and I have a lot of respect for him, so we will see what Chelsea decide and what they plan to do. You guys will see the decision [then].'
