This fierce bear shows its more relaxed and calm side by having a lazy day as it sleeps on a beach.

She twists and turns on her back and struggles to get comfortable before nodding off during the day.

The 18-month-old female brown bear even covers her eyes with her giant paw before enjoying a nap.

At one point, the giant bear strikes a Usain Bolt-like pose as she lies on her back while pointing her right arm in the air.

She also stares into the camera lens when she was just 50ft away from the photographer.

Professional photographer Olav Thokle from Volda, Norway, travelled to the Lake Clark National Park to take pictures of the bears.

The 46-year-old said: 'Me and a friend went to Alaska for a nature and landscape photography trip.

'The main purpose for this was to try to spot brown bears as Lake Clark National, Alaska, is one of the best places in the world to do this.'

Mr Thokle managed to find 14 individual bears walking around on the beach that day.

He added: 'Some of the bears slept nearly all day, especially the female who is pictured.

'She looked quite young, and had no cubs, so she could think only of herself.

'It looked like she had a really good time sleeping on the beach for several hours.

'She sometimes opened her eyes to have a quick look before falling asleep again.'

The only way to get to Chinitna Bay - a famous home for brown bears - is to travel by plane.

Mr Thokle added: 'We rented a small airplane, and a professional bear guide. After a one hour flight we landed on the beach on Chinitna Bay.

'From the air we could spot some bears on the beach, and then we knew that this would be a very special experience.

'The guide warned us: "Never run! It's like a dog and a ball. The ball never wins!"

'We tried to keep a distance of at least 50 feet, but a few bears came closer.'
