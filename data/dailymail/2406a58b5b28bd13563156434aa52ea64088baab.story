Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney 'cheated' to win a penalty at Preston, insists Stan Collymore.

The forward went over after being challenged by North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann, before picking himself up to convert the resulting spot-kick that put United 3-1 up on Monday.

But debate surrounded about whether Rooney had dived to win a penalty, with former England striker Gary Lineker tweeting: 'A dive? Yes. A reckless challenge? Yes. An interesting one.'

But Collymore was in no doubt that Rooney was guilty of diving: 'Rooney shouldn't be diving due to his position as captain of club and country,' said on talkSport. 

'He toe-pokes the ball past the goalkeeper, who he knows is coming out quickly, and he dives,' said Collymore. 'That’s cheating, we’ve had this debate a million times.'

He added: 'When you wear that respect campaign armband, you owe it to the fans and the game not to do that.

'I’m bitterly disappointed, he is the England captain and Manchester United captain and he’s better than that.'

Collymore's view that Rooney was echoed by former Preston player Kevin Kilbane, who said: 'There's no contact on Wayne Rooney. It's a dive.'

However, Preston manager Simon Grayson refused to criticise Rooney, despite believing Stuckmann had not touched the United captain. 

‘Wayne Rooney has not been touched by the goalkeeper. Yes he has had to jump out of the way but he has not been touched. I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty, I’m saying there was no contact. You can interpret that how you want,' said Grayson. 

‘It wasn’t a dive. He has gone to get out of the way and take evasive action. I’ m not complaining.'

Rooney was defended by former United team-mate Phil Neville and England manager Roy Hodgson. 

Neville said: 'Wayne Rooney had to get out the way. For me it's a reckless challenge.' 

Hodgson said: 'I don't think it is a dive, he's taking evasive action.'
