Ross McCormack has handed in a transfer request in a bid to push through his move from Leeds United to Fulham.

The Scotland international stayed behind 
while his teammates went on their pre-season trip to Santa Cristina in 
Italy on Monday as speculation about his future rumbles on.

And the 27-year-old has made it clear he wants to quit Elland Road after telling Leeds chiefs he wants out of the club.

In demand: Fulham and Norwich both want to sign Leeds striker McCormack, who scored 28 goals last season

Holding out: Leeds are looking to ensure they get a large fee for the Championship's top goalscorer

Leeds value McCormack, 27, at £12million while Fulham have offered £7m for the striker, who smashed 28 goals last season.

Fulham, meanwhile, are in talks with Cologne over a deal for attacking midfielder Adil Chihi, 26, and have signed FC Basel right-back Kay Voser for an undisclosed fee.

Done deal: Kay Voser has signed a two-year contract with Fulham

The 27-year-old has agreed a two-year contract at Craven Cottage, with an option for a further year.

Elsewhere, Leeds have signed goalkeeper Stuart Taylor on a one year deal.
