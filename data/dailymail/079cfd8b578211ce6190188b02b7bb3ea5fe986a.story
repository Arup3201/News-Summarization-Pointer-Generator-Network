Mauricio Pochettino will be asking Tottenham chiefs to fast-track the move to their new stadium at this rate.

Remarkably, this was Spurs’ first home Saturday 3pm kick-off of the season. Not that it helped, as Crystal Palace added to Pochettino’s disappointing White Hart Lane record with a well-deserved point.

From a possible 24 points, Spurs have accumulated just 10 from their home league matches this season.

In many ways, Pochettino will be the happier of the two managers this morning. He will certainly be the most relieved, as Neil Warnock’s men squandered numerous chances to inflict another home defeat for Spurs.

In explaining his side’s lacklustre display, Pochettino said: ‘We are frustrated, like the fans.

‘The team did not show freshness of other games, maybe because we played three games in six days.

‘It makes a difference if you have two days for recovery and the other team has three days [Palace played Aston Villa on Tuesday, Spurs played Chelsea on Wednesday].

‘That extra day is massive but it is not an excuse. We realise the schedule will sometimes not be good.’

Maybe Warnock’s threat to cancel Christmas had something to do with his team’s vibrancy yesterday. ‘I told them they couldn’t have their party if they lost, so they can have it now,’ he said.

‘I leave disappointed but proud we’ve got a point. We had a chance to get three points at White Hart Lane, there’s not many chances to do that now at my age.’

And the signs were there from the get-go, as Palace, in true Warnock style, made life difficult for the hosts.

Christian Eriksen nearly opened the scoring for Spurs in the seventh minute, firing into the side-netting after nutmegging Martin Kelly on the left-hand byline. But — led by left-winger Yannick Bolasie — Palace could easily have found themselves ahead in the opening 20 minutes.

Ryan Mason’s attempt at a defensive header from Bolasie’s inswinging corner went inches from nestling inside Hugo Lloris’s far post in the 17th minute.

Three minutes later James McArthur should have hit the target after Bolasie produced an outrageous piece of skill to leave Eric Dier — who had a torrid afternoon at right-back — and Eriksen for dead, before finding the Scot inside the area.

Spurs had chances of their own, Julian Speroni saving Eriksen’s free-kick before the Dane stood up a cross that Roberto Soldado should have buried. By the hour mark, the home crowd were restless. The team that had looked to be getting to grips with Pochettino’s high-pressing style in the early stages of their 3-0 loss at Chelsea was nowhere to be seen.

With 13 minutes left, Jason Puncheon went close to giving Palace the lead they so deserved — hammering a shot on to the bar. Seconds later, he had the ball in the net — but referee Lee Mason had blown for offside.

Puncheon was in the thick of the action again, waltzing through and finding Bolasie with a cut back — but his strike was superbly saved.

The Palace bench could not believe it. Nor could the home fans. A chorus of boos echoed round White Hart Lane. They were even louder at full-time.

But they continued to lack fluency. Lloris produced the first meaningful save of the second period, denying Zaha after the winger skipped past Eriksen in the 55th minute. 

By this point, home supporters were getting restless. They have suffered so much at White Hart Lane already this season.

Spurs looked like they were finally getting to grips with Pochettino's high-pressing tactics during the opening 20 minutes of their 3-0 loss at Chelsea on Wednesday.

Make no bones about it, they had the champions elect rattled in their own backyard.

The tables were turned, Palace were forcing Spurs onto the back-foot and the home side were struggling to find answers.

Soldado was presented with a guild-edge chance to ease the tension in the 63rd minute; Harry Kane playing him through - but the striker fired wildly wide with just Speroni in front of him.

Bolaise terrorised Dier yet again in the 70th minute before firing an angled shot wide, before substitute Jason Puncheon saw his deflected effort dip narrowly over the bar.

Then, with 13 minutes left on the clock, Puncheon came agonisingly close to giving Palace the lead they so deserved - hammering an angled shot onto the bar after Bolasie caused more havoc down the left.

Seconds later, Puncheon had the ball in the net - but referee Lee Mason had already blown for offside.

Puncheon was in the thick of the action again with nine minutes left to play, waltzing through Spurs right-side before finding Bolasie with a cut back - but the forward's firm strike was superbly saved by Lloris.

The Palace bench couldn't believe it. Nor could the home supporters, as a chorus of boos echoed round White Hart Lane.

Aaron Lennon was introduced for the final seven minutes, as Spurs looked for an undeserved winner.

But his substitution made little impact as the final whistle was greeted by more boos as the Pochettino's problems mount.
