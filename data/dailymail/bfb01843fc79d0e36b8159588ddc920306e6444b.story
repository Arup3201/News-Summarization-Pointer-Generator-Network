Cowering and screaming for mercy as she is lashed dozens of times, this is the fate that awaits mother-of-two Meriam Ibrahim who has been sentenced to death in Sudan for marrying a Christian.

Meriam could be given 100 lashes within days just like this woman as part of her barbaric punishment that has caused outrage worldwide, MailOnline can reveal.

Campaigners today said it could leave Meriam scarred, humiliated and with deep psychological wounds that may never heal.

Inhumane: In the 2010 video an unidentified woman is ordered to get on her knees as police gear up to whip her

Degrading: The woman was flogged in public as an example to others. The Sudanese government confirmed the authenticity of the video saying she was being punished under Articles 154 and 155 of their penal code

Begging: As the end of the whip cracks against her back the woman pleads for mercy and her mother  

Meriam is still recovering from giving birth to her daughter Maya two weeks ago in the prison in the Sudanese capital Khartoum where she has been held captive since last September.

Her son Martin, 20 months, has been in custody with her the whole time too.

Meriam, 27, a doctor, was put on death row after being convicted of apostasy and adultery by a strict Islamic court.

Her case has attracted the condemnation of the governments of Britain, the US and the Netherlands who have branded her treatment as 'barbaric'.

The Sudanese government appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to releasing Meriam last week under the growing international pressure - but did a dramatic U-turn.

It is now waiting for the outcome of her appeal, which will be within the next week or two.

International human rights organisation REDRESS told MailOnline that pressure needed to be maintained on Sudan to make sure that Meriam is freed.

Lutz Oette,
 of REDRESS, said: 'This may well be the fate that awaits Meriam unless 
her appeal is successful. The video shows how flogging violates the 
dignity of its victims who are more often than not women.

'REDRESS calls for an end to this practice, which is cruel, inhuman and degrading.'

The
 footage of the flogging was originally filmed in December 2010 and 
shows the woman wearing a full hijab in a public area surrounded by 
policemen in blue uniforms as a crowd of men look on.

She
 is clearly distressed and is seen holding up her hands as she is told: 
'We’ll jail you for two years if you don’t bend down and sit on the 
ground'.

U-turn: The Sudanese government - in the face of growing international pressure - claimed that Meriam (being held with her baby and son Martin in prison) would be released. That was a few weeks ago and she is still there

Outrage: Meriam was sentenced to death for refusing to convert to Islam and 100 lashes for 'adultery' because it is illegal in Sudan for a Muslim to marry a Christian

She kneels down and begins to cry out loud, bawling as the impatient policeman says: 'Sit down quickly, we want to go'.

The woman screams in agony as the policeman repeatedly whips her legs and body. She pleads: 'Enough! Enough!' and 'I want my mum!'

At one point she grabs the whip but another policeman moves towards her and starts whipping too. Two of the policemen are seen laughing and joking as the punishment continues.

The identity of the woman or the location of her lashing in Sudan have never been identified but the government there did confirm that the video was authentic.

A spokesman said the cruel punishment was meted out under Articles 154 and 155 of the 1991 Sudanese penal code which mandates flogging up to 100 lashes for adultery or running a brothel.

Meriam’s appeal with the court in Khartoum is ongoing and says her conviction was a breach of her right to religious freedom.

Meriam’s 
lawyers have also filed a separate appeal with the African Commission 
which does not have enforcement powers over Sudan but can add to the 
international pressure were it to rule in their favour.

MailOnline
 can also disclose that Meriam’s husband Daniel, a naturalised US 
citizen, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, has finally met with 
the US embassy in Khartoum.

Yet
 in a cruel twist they have demanded that he submit to a paternity test 
before they assist his children further, even though he has presented 
them with his marriage certificate to their mother and his passport.

Daniel,
 a biochemist, had earlier claimed that he had been ignored three times 
by the embassy because they were 'too busy' to see her.

Helpless: At one point she grabs the whip but another policeman moves towards her and starts whipping too

Sick: The policeman laughs at the camera as the horrific spectacle unfolds and is amused it is being filmed

Tina Ramirez of US-based religious freedom campaigners Hardwired said that the development was a 'slap in the face' for him.

Meriam was originally thrown in jail after her half brother filed a lawsuit in Khartoum which led to the criminal charges against her.

A judge found her guilty because he refused to recognise her 2011 marriage because her father was a Muslim.

Even though Meriam’s father left her family when he was six she should still worship Islam, the ruling said.

During one of her court hearings Meriam said that she was 'was never a Muslim, I was raised a Christian from the start' but it made no difference.

Martin was born in Sudan and may be entitled to US citizenship because Daniel is a naturalized American, though the process is complicated and not certain.

The same applies to Maya too and she could potentially become an American.

Among those
 who have supported Meriam are Hillary Clinton who has said in a 
statement: 'Meriam Ibrahim’s death sentence is abhorrent. Sudan should 
stop threatening religious freedom and fundamental human rights'.

In
 the UK Justine Greening, the international development minister, has 
tweeted: 'Sudan must not allow the execution of Meriam Ibrahim to go 
ahead. #SaveMeriam'.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said: 'I wholeheartedly endorse this call for the death sentence to be dropped'.

Some
 1.5 million people have also signed petitions calling for Meriam’s 
release including 900,000 on one alone set up by human rights 
campaigners Amnesty.

In the US, two Senators have demanded that the State Department do more to help Daniel and Meriam.

Senator Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, has spoken directly with the State Department's Special Envoy for Sudan.

Love: Meriam married Daniel Wani, a biochemist, who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire. He has now travelled back to Sudan in a bid to save his wife and children

Fury: Daniel is angry that the Us Embassy in Khartoum have demanded he take a paternity test before they decide whether they can help his children, who would have a claim to US citizenship and US protection

Rep Trent Franks, R-Arizona, also raised it at the Homeland Security Department Oversight Committee.

In response Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security said: 'I will personally take a look at this case, it sounds troubling'.

Earlier this week a member of the House of Lords called for the UK to grant Meriam asylum.

Lord Alton of Liverpool said that allowing her to move to Britain would be an 'unequivocal demonstration of the value of a civilised country and a humane society.'

The Foreign Office has not yet responded to his comments.
