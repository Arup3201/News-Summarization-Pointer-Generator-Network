To many people, they’re already quite sickly enough. But a chip shop has found a way to add extra oomph to Cadbury’s creme eggs – and is selling them deep-fried.

The eggs – a long-standing Easter treat – are dipped in batter and then put in boiling fat for between 30 and 40 seconds to ensure the yolk warms up, but the chocolate doesn’t completely melt.

Surprisingly, perhaps, the chip shop that came up with the snack says it is doing a roaring trade.

The eggs are covered in batter and then deep-fried to up to 40 seconds. It's important to time it right, so the yolk is soft but the chocolate hasn't completely melted

Fish shop manager Rachel Tweedale: 'We started selling them to help raise money for charity and people keep asking for them'

The dish was initially introduced to raise money for charity but was so popular it has been carried on

Lincoln-based Elite Fish And Chips manager Rachel Tweedale said: ‘Despite people being dubious at first, they sell really well.

‘We started selling them to help raise money for charity and people keep asking for them. If you like chocolate then you’ll absolutely love the eggs, especially as the middle melts slightly.’ Customers can eat the eggs with ice cream in the chip shop’s restaurant for £2 or take them away for £1.

The new Easter treat follows other sickly desserts such as deep-fried Ferrero Rocher and battered Mars bars.
