Actor Hugh Grant and writer Jemima Khan must be shown police information which indicates that their telephone messages might have been intercepted by a private investigator working for the press, a High Court judge ruled today.

Mr Justice Vos ordered the Metropolitan Police to disclose information detectives had gathered during inquiries into alleged telephone hacking to Mr Grant and Ms Khan.

The judge said Mr Grant and Ms Khan were entitled to see police documentation concerning messages allegedly intercepted by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and used in articles in 'the News of the World and other newspapers'.

In a further development, News Corp announced today it is to terminate any arrangement to pay the legal fees of Mr Mulcaire 'with immediate effect'.

Angry: Actor Hugh Grant and socialite Jemima Khan, seen at Westminster yesterday, now have the right to see messages allegedly intercepted by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and used in the News of the World and other newspapers

Four years ago private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were given jail terms after the Old Bailey heard that they plotted to hack into royal aides' telephone messages

At yesterday's hearing of the Commons 
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, the media mogul's son James Murdoch 
admitted he had been 'very surprised' to learn payments were being made 
towards Mr Mulcaire's legal fees.

Lawyers for Mr Grant and Ms Khan had 
asked for the disclosure order during a High Court hearing in London. 
The application was not opposed by police.

They said police had indicated that 
they had material which suggested that messages received and sent by Mr 
Grant and Ms Khan might have been intercepted.

Neither Mr Grant, 50, nor Ms Khan, 
37, daughter of billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith and ex-wife of
former Pakistan cricket star Imran Khan, were at the hearing.

Four years ago Mulcaire and former 
News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were given jail terms after
the Old Bailey heard how they plotted to hack into royal aides' 
telephone messages.

New police inquiries have started 
since then and a number of high-profile figures, including Labour 
politician Lord Prescott, actor Jude Law, television presenter Ulrika 
Jonsson and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, have launched damages claims 
against News Group Newspapers, publishers of the News of the World.

A civil trial at the High Court is due in January.

Around 30 people, including jockey 
Kieren Fallon, politicians Tessa Jowell, Chris Bryant and Mark Oaten, 
interior designer Kelly Hoppen, sports agent Sky Andrew and former 
Football Association boss David Davies and ex-soccer player and 
Professional Footballers' Association boss Mick McGuire, have made 
damages claims, say lawyers.

Mr Justice Vos is due to hear 
evidence relating to a group of 'lead claimants' at the trial in January
and assess damages. Any rulings he makes are expected to provide a 
blueprint for the way other claims are dealt with.

Actress Sienna Miller and footballer-turned-pundit Andy Gray have already settled civil claims against News Group Newspapers.

The development comes amid claims 
that Rupert Murdoch's company was guilty of ‘deliberately thwarting’ the
criminal investigation into the News of the World, according to a 
hard-hitting report published today.

The Home Affairs Select Committee 
study ‘deplores’ the behaviour of News International and condemns the 
police for bungling their investigation and getting too close to the 
Murdoch empire.

The report raises questions about the
honesty of former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and
Andy Hayman, who oversaw the original 2006 police probe of the 
newspaper.

The Home Affairs Select Committee 
said in its withering assessment today: ‘We deplore the response of News
International to the original investigation into hacking.

‘It is almost impossible to escape 
the conclusion that they were deliberately trying to thwart a criminal 
investigation. We are astounded at the length of time it has taken for 
News International to co-operate with the police.’

The report points out that Mrs 
Brooks’s denial of knowledge of phone hacking ‘is limited to her time as
editor of News of the World’, a small part of her career in News 
International.

And it also raises concerns about her
knowledge of illegal payments to corrupt police officers. ‘She did not 
say that she had no knowledge of specific payments but that she had not 
intended to give the impression that she had knowledge of specific 
cases,’ the MPs conclude.

The committee condemns the police, 
singling out former assistant Met commissioner Mr Hayman,  criticising 
his handling of the case, his social contacts with News International 
executives and his decision to take a job with the firm after leaving 
the police.

It said: ‘Mr Hayman’s conduct during 
the investigation and during our evidence session was both 
unprofessional and inappropriate.’

There was also criticism in the 
report for Dick Fedorcio, Scotland Yard's current communications chief, 
for apparently showing 'no due diligence' in conducting proper checks on
Neil Wallis.

Wallis, an ex-News of the World 
executive, was employed by the Met in 2009 and was last week questioned 
about phone hacking allegations.

The committee said it was 
'particularly shocked' by Mr Fedorcio's approach to hiring Wallis and 
said he tried to deflect blame on to Mr Yates.

MPs called for extra funding to 
support Operation Weeting, saying it would take years to inform all 
potential victims without it.

They praised Deputy Assistant 
Commissioner Sue Akers' decision to contact all potential victims of 
phone hacking by the News of the World.

But they said they were 'alarmed' 
that only 170 had have so far been informed, adding that 'up to 12,800 
people may have been affected.'

In another development it was claimed
today that Buckingham Palace was 'troubled' by David Cameron's decision
to hire Andy Coulson.

Labour MP Chris Bryant made the 
extraordinary revelation to the BBC. He said: 'Very senior people at 
Buckingham Palace were very troubled by the appointment of Andy Coulson 
and tried to make it absolutely clear to the Prime Minister.

'I am not sure whether this 
information ever got directly to the Prime Minister, but it certainly 
got to senior figures at Downing Street.

'The Queen's grandchildren had their 
phones hacked. And quite probably other members of the Royal Household 
... I think it would be perfectly natural for very senior members of the
Royal Family to be very troubled about the appointment.

'After all, Andy Coulson was the 
editor of the News of the World when the royal princes' phones were 
hacked. That is not in dispute.

'And Andy Coulson indeed resigned from the News of the World expressly because of the hacking of the royal princes' phones.'

However Mr Bryant's claim was 
strongly rejected by Buckingham Palace. A spokesman said: 'On no 
occasion did any officials from Buckingham Palace raise concerns to 
Downing Street and indeed it is outrageous to suggest this.'

A No. 10 source described Mr Bryant's claims as 'scurrilous' and 'complete rubbish'.

The source insisted that at no point 
did the Palace try to warn officials at Downing Street or Mr Cameron's 
political team against Mr Coulson's appointment.
