Swansea winger Wayne Routledge has been ruled out for four weeks with a calf strain.

Routledge, who has featured in 19 of the club's 22 Barclays Premier League fixtures this campaign and scored three times, came off after only 32 minutes of last weekend's 5-0 home defeat to Chelsea.

But there was better news for Swansea manager Garry Monk on Tuesday as Ecuador international Jefferson Montero returned to full training for the first time since sustaining a hamstring injury in the 1-0 victory against Aston Villa on Boxing Day.
