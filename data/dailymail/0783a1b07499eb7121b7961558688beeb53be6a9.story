BBC chiefs accepted yesterday that producers had made a huge mistake in a children’s programme by claiming that Florence Nightingale was ‘racist’.

Historians had accused the corporation of ‘insulting’ her memory by dramatising a scene showing the nurse – famous for her work in the Crimean War – discriminating against a black colleague, Mary Seacole.

Horrible Histories featured a sketch in which Miss Nightingale rejects four job applications from Jamaican-born Miss Seacole, saying the work was only ‘for British girls’.

Wrong: BBC chiefs accepted that CBBC's Horrible Histories wrong to suggest that Florence Nightingale (right, the lady with the lamp) turned down colleague Mary Seacole (left) for not being British

A formal complaint was made by the Nightingale Society, a collection of historians who seek to promote knowledge of her contribution to nursing.

One member, Professor Lynn McDonald, wrote in the Daily Mail in August how political correctness had led to Miss Nightingale being smeared.

Originally broadcast as part of the hit children's CBBC history show, the sketch also appeared on the BBC's Learning Zone, an educational, online resource for children.

Viewers saw the actress playing Miss Nightingale say: 'The nursing corps was for British girls. You're from Jamaica' to which Seacole responded: 'Me father was from Scotland.'

The Seacole character was also seen saying: 'Four times me tried to join Old Lamp-Face's nurses in the Crimean War, and four times she said no.'

Yesterday The BBC Trust, the corporation’s governing body, ruled that the two-minute, 34-second clip’s ‘depiction of Florence Nightingale in relation to racial issues was materially inaccurate’. 

The Committee said that programme-makers should have done more to make it clear that it was not Miss Nightingale herself who rejected Seacole.

Seacole had, in fact, gone to Crimea to start her business and didn't ask once for a job.

Seacole never nursed in a hospital, did not start a nursing school, never wrote books or articles on nursing. She never did anything to rival Nightingale's truly pioneering work to improve healthcare

The reality is that she went to Russia in the spring of 1855 to set up a provisions store that sold luxury items (such as tinned lobster) to officers, and a restaurant and bar where they could dine and drink champagne.

It was hardly fare for rank and file soldiers.

Rather than ministering to the sick and wounded, Seacole's main work by day was food preparation.  

It said that viewers of the clip, which also showed the pair jostling, 'would be likely to receive the overall impression that Florence Nightingale had acted towards Mary Seacole in a racially discriminatory manner'. 

It said that given Miss Nightingale's 'significant stature' in modern British history, the allegation required 'compelling proof'.

The Committee concluded that the sketch breached guidelines on accuracy, saying: 'Given the seriousness of any imputation of racism, the relative recency of Nightingale's life...the immensity of Nightingale's contribution to modern nursing and her significant stature in modern British history, the Committee felt it was incumbent on the programme makers to ensure that there was sound evidence upon which to base any suggestion that she had acted in a racially discriminatory manner in a Learning Zone clip.

'It appeared to the Committee that an allegation of such gravity against a person such as Nightingale required compelling proof. In the Committee's view, the programme makers had provided no such evidence.'

It said that it was not trying to suggest limiting 'the range of comedic or dramatic devices' used in history content for children.

'However in this very specific instance, making a charge of racism was very serious.'

It added: 'The Committee felt in considering this particular clip and this issue, especially given that it appeared in the Learning Zone, it was important for a clear and rigorous adherence to fact, even within the context of the audience expectations for the format of Horrible Histories.'

Children's comedy Horrible Histories began in 1993 as a series of books, written by Terry Deary, before being adapted into stage productions and a CBBC TV show.

A BBC spokesman said: 'We note and accept the findings of the ESC. The intention of this Horrible Histories sketch was never to undermine the reputation of such an important historical figure like Florence Nightingale, but to open up a discussion of some of the attitudes of the time.

'The Learning Zone has withdrawn the sketch from their website and the episode of Horrible Histories will not be repeated in its present form.'
