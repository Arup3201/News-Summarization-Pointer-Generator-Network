Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge only started dancing after scoring because his favourite celebration of pulling his shirt over his head would get him yellow carded after every goal.

The England international made his first appearance in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday following a five-month absence, and took just 12 minutes to score as Liverpool beat West Ham 2-0. 

Sturridge used the trademark celebration on his highly-anticipated return at Anfield but the 25-year-old has exclusively explained it only came about because of a change in the rules.

'Circumstances when a player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour e.g

'If a player removes his jersey or shirt over his head or covers his head with his jersey or shirt when celebrating a goal.'

Sturridge, when asked by BBC Match of the Day magazine if he'd missed his celebration, said: 'I don't need to work on that, it comes naturally! I might switch it up, though. 

'Back in the day the best celebration was the shirt over the head, but now that's a yellow card – that's how this one started.

'It's been a long time and I was just desperate to get back out there and help my team win some games – that's really the most important thing for me. 

'It's the worst experience - watching from the sidelines when you're a player. 

'But it helps you mentally and I feel like I've improved as a person. I'm enjoying it more and I'm just happy to be back playing.' 

Sturridge has been helpless as Liverpool's bid to win their first Premier League title falls flat this season after finishing second behind champions Manchester City last year.

The striker has  seen captain Steven Gerrard announce he will be ending his 26-year association with the club at the end of the season, and Sturridge admits he took the news hard.

'Devastated, if I'm being honest. I was devastated,' Sturridge says. 'He's a legend, one of the biggest to have ever played in England - maybe the biggest, along with David Beckham. 

'He'll always be someone I admire, he's a great man.' 

Liverpool were knocked out of the Capital One Cup semi-final by Chelsea but remain in the FA Cup, though they must see off Bolton  in their fourth-round replay at the Macron Stadium on Wednesday.

The competition may represent Liverpool's final chance for silverware this year, but Sturridge is not jumping to conclusions just yet. 

'Taking each game as it comes is the most realistic target,' he says. 'We need to focus on each game and stop putting pressure on ourselves. Adding pressure – that’s not good.'
