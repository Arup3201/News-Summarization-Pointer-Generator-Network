Reality star Gemma Collins loves to cause a stir.

Her recent on-screen antics have had TOWIE fans glued to their screens as she put the men of Essex firmly in their place and although the series ends this week the bubbly blonde has no intention of taking things easy as she unveils her third fashion collection for plus size women.

The fashion line, which is available in sizes 14-22 and was launched last year, has proved to be a brilliant success for the Romford business woman.

As a woman who embraces her curves, the 32-year-old is well placed to design fashion that flatters and her frank style advice has secured her an army of fans as well as a regular presenting slot on ITV's This Morning show.

The Cheltenham Dress (also available in black and mocha) £65

The Montana Dress (also available in black) £60

Her latest collection is designed 
with the summer season in mind, with bright colours and glamorous 
details giving the dresses a more grown-up feel.

The former car sales assistant has 
reworked the most popular styles from her previous two collections in 
new colour ways (the Rome maxi dress now comes in block-colour and the 
lace 'Prague' dress has been made in a sophisticated navy).

Gemma said: 'I am so excited that my new spring summer range of the Gemma Collins Collection is finally here.

'This new range is fresh, vibrant and
I have designed it using gorgeous fabrics that make the bigger girl 
feel a million dollars.

The Rome Dress £60

The Amalfie Dress (also available in black/peach) £70

The Moscow Dress (also available in cream) £65

The Ascot Dress £70

'I have added colour for the new season as I want every girl to feel as glamorous as me in my dresses.

'I have also included a few classics with flattering shapes but still in the signature Gemma Collins style.

'It sounds silly but I have no 
favourites in the range really as I love them all the same. I would 
never design something that I didn’t feel passionate about it and these 
are all beauties.

'I like to use colour as I want to celebrate curves. The plus size market to date is dull and depressing, I want big girls to feel accepted in society and be joyous and bright when they put clothes on.

'I choose the prints and colours from the feeling I get from them. If a fabric makes me smile or makes me get excited then I know it's the right choice.

'Being a bigger girl I feel the limited plus size high street shops offer all the wrong fabrics so I spent 6 months learning about fabrics feeling them researching them and realised the slinky fabrics that skim the curves are most flattering.

The Canada Top £40

The Rome Dress £60

'I love all the old film stars really
Marylin Monroe, Diana Dors and Jayne Mansfield. These women took 
glamour to the max. I like the Karsdashian sisters' style as they rock 
their curves.

'I work spontaneously. I wake up at 4am some mornings thinking about designs.

'My main passion for designing is taking in trends and thinking how can I make this flattering and fun for the fuller figure?'

Gemma's debut 50-piece collection, launched in 2012, was estimated to have turned over £1m.

The
star said at the time her success would be all the sweeter because it 
would be one in the eye for the bullies and internet trolls that make 
fun of her for being fat. 

She says: 'It makes me laugh to think 
people take the mick out of my size, but I’ve made being larger actually
very profitable. On top of that I’ve met the man of my dreams [show co-star Arg]. As far 
as I’m concerned that’s enough to answer any critics... frankly, they 
can kiss my a***!'
