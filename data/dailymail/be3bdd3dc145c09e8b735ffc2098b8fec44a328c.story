Jihadist Aqsa Mahmood broke her silence yesterday to warn Western Muslims that it's 'us against them' and to 'pick a side' in the war

Jihadist Aqsa Mahmood broke her silence yesterday to warn Western Muslims that it’s ‘us against them’ and to ‘pick a side’ in the war.

On the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Mahmood posted her diatribe in a third instalment of her online ‘Diary of a Muhajirah (immigrant)’ – in which she also said she would only come home to raise the black flag of IS over Britain.

She suspended her Twitter account after the Scottish Daily Mail revealed her identity as a Glaswegian private schoolgirl who abandoned her university studies to flee to Syria.

Yesterday, using a Tumblr blogging and social networking account under her adopted name ‘Umm Layth’, she shunned her Scottish identity and rejected her family’s pleas to return home.

The 20-year-old – who married an IS fighter in February – added: ‘The only time we will ever, ever return to those lands beithnillah (if God wills) is to raise our flag.’

She pledged allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and promised the West would be invaded and ‘blood will be spilled’.

She also described Prime Minister David Cameron’s call for new powers to stop British-born extremists from returning to the UK as ‘the biggest joke of this week’.

She wrote: ‘This is a war against Islam and it is know (sic) that either “you’re with them or with us”. So pick a side.

‘My dear brothers and sisters who are stuck in the west and restrained due to the kufr (infidel) governments know that indeed the help of Allah swt (may he be glorified and exalted) is always near, have Sabr (patience) and know that you will never be tested beyond your ability.

‘And to those who are able and can still make your way, please ittaqillah (fear Allah) and don’t delay anymore, hasten hasten hasten to our lands and live in Izzah (honour) before it is made difficult for you. Know that these trialing times and do not miss out on any of the ajr (rewards).’

Mahmood’s parents, Glasgow businessman Muzaffar and his wife Khalida, last week branded their daughter a ‘bedroom radical’ who betrayed and shamed her family when she joined IS.

They condemned her actions and added she was ‘brainwashed and deluded’, but insisted that they still loved her and begged her to come home. In a heartbreaking press conference, they said: ‘You have betrayed us, our community and the people of Scotland when you took this step.

‘Aqsa, you have torn the heart out of our family and changed our lives forever, please come home.’

The family added that they have not seen their daughter since November last year and had contacted Police Scotland to report her missing after she disappeared.

But in her latest posting Mahmood claimed that she has now ‘disassociated’ herself from her family and friends in Scotland.

She said: ‘The family you get in exchange for leaving the ones behind are like the pearl in comparison to the Shell you threw away into the foam of the sea.’

Now her allegiance ‘is and will only be to our beloved Ameer, destroyer of the enemies, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and to the Islamic State’.

She added: ‘All of us disassociated ourselves from our families, friends and societies.

‘We make it known to the world that never has our allegiance been to the Scottish, British, Swedish, American, Canadian etc…. government.’

In a message to Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama, she suggests that Islamic State will bring the battle to the West and adds they will ‘be known and feared’ across the world.

She wrote: ‘Know this Cameron/Obama, you and your countries will be beneath our feet and your Kufr (infidel) will be destroyed, this is a promise from Allah swt that we have no doubt over.

‘If not you then your grandchildren or their grandchildren. But worry not, somewhere along the line your blood will be spilled by our cubs in Dawlah (state).

‘We have conquered these lands once Beithnillah (if God wills) we will do it again.’
