'Prodded patient's breasts': Healthcare worker 
Akousa Sakyiwaa is one of three accused of abusing 
elderly dementia patients at Whipps Cross Hospital

A ‘violent’ nursing assistant put a 
sheet over a dementia patient’s head and told her she was ‘the dead one’
during a campaign of abuse, a court heard yesterday.

Akousa
Sakyiwaa, 38, had already prodded 87-year-old Joan Mussett’s breasts 
and told her, ‘I’m young and my breasts are better than yours’, it is 
alleged.

When Miss Mussett 
complained, Sakyiwaa pulled the bed clothes over the elderly woman’s 
head and reportedly said: ‘See, you’re the dead one.’

John
McNally, prosecuting, said the health care assistant appeared ‘to have 
the confidence to ridicule the idea that anything would happen to her’, 
and accused her of acting ‘towards patients not as people but as things,
there to inconvenience her’.

He added: ‘The proper role of a carer was apparently alien to her.’

Sakyiwaa
is one of three carers accused of abusing dementia patients at Whipps 
Cross Hospital in Leytonstone, east London.

Together with Annette 
Jackson, 33, and Sharmila Gunda, 36, Sakyiwaa is charged with 14 counts 
of neglect and ill-treatment and two counts of assault against 11 
patients in their care.

The 
patients they treated on the now-closed Beech Ward were described to the
jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court as ‘vulnerable’ and ‘elderly’ ladies, 
many of whom suffered from dementia.

Mr
McNally described the incident in which Sakyiwaa first ‘wobbled’ her 
patient’s breasts before comparing them to her own and taunted her by 
wrapping her in a bed sheet when she complained. In another incident,

Mr
McNally told how Sakyiwaa told the ‘chatty’ and ‘happy’ Miss Mussett to
‘shut up’ because she ‘talked too much’.

When she continued to mumble, Sakyiwaa grabbed her patient’s mouth and held it physically shut.

Sakyiwaa
is also charged with ill-treating Louise Hodges, 92, calling her ‘lazy’
for not moving herself to the toilet and then slapping her bottom when 
changing her soiled bed clothes as punishment.

When
Miss Hodges complained to her on another occasion,  saying ‘You nearly 
choked me’, Sakyiwaa’s response was, ‘Yeah, I should have.’

Jackson
is charged with five counts of ill-treatment of her patients, including
waking patient Kathleen Cavannagh by shouting ‘wakey, wakey, Grandma’ 
and smacking her in the side of her head with an incontinence pad.

The 
shocking behaviour of the three women came to light when they were 
reported by a student nurse who was appalled by what she saw on the ward
during an eight-week placement in spring 2012, the court heard.

Fragile
women were allegedly pulled into and out of beds by their gowns, and on
more than one occasion were slapped or ‘whacked’ for resisting.

Giving
evidence yesterday, Lucy Brown said she was ‘speechless’ at what she 
saw and that she ‘tried not to think’ about what was happening on the 
ward.

Miss Brown recalled one occasion when Sakyiwaa grabbed and 
painfully twisted 92-year-old Lily Oliver’s arthritic knee.

She
said: ‘She was really pale and quiet and she looked at me but I looked 
away because I felt so bad, I couldn’t make eye contact with her.’

The incidents are alleged to have taken place from February 27 to April 30 last year on Beech Ward at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London

John McNally, prosecuting, told the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court that the three women were responsible for looking after elderly female patients with various physical and mental conditions including dementia

Paul
Webb, defending Sakyiwaa, put to Miss Brown that the behaviour was 
simply the actions of busy staff working in difficult conditions.

But 
Miss Brown said: ‘I have witnessed abuse . . . you cannot smack a 
patient.’

Sakyiwaa, Jackson and Gunda deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
