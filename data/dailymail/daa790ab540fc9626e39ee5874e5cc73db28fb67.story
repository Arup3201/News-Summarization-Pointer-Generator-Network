A health and safety inspector suffered life-changing burns in an NHS hospital while undergoing routine surgery after staff made a mistake using an electric blanket known as a 'hot dog'. 

Mike Wilcock, 58, required a skin graft after suffering third-degree burns to his right buttock after undergoing surgery to remove a cyst on his kidney at Maidstone Hospital in Kent.

Inner London Crown Court heard that staff had not been properly trained in how to use the electric blanket.

Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust is facing a possible six-figure fine after admitting failing in its duty under the 1974 Health and Safety Act. 

Prosecutor William Davis told the court that Mr Wilcock gone through a 'stressful and painful experience' since the procedure in September 25, 2012.

The temperature of the warming equipment, which can rise to 50C in less than an hour, had soared during Mr Wilcock's operation because a cold saline bag was touching a sensor, the court heard. 

The injuries - caused during the routine operation - meant he was admitted to a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead during September of 2012.

The burn caused permanent scarring and left Mr Wilcock out of work for four months.

He must now be chauffeured by his wife Eileen due to mobility problems, Inner London Crown Court heard. 

'It caused the mattress to become extremely hot,' Mr Davis said.

Malcolm Fortune, defending the NHS Trust at Inner London Crown Court, pictured, asked Mr Justice Sweeney to consider a fine in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 as the affair has already cost them almost £100,000 

No alarm was raised during the operation and his injuries were only discovered when Mr Wilcock woke up to discover a large burn on his right hip and buttock, the court heard.

He was referred to a burns unit and has needed repeated hospital treatment on his burns, and has also developed cardiac problems, the hearing was told.

'Mr Wilcock has suffered serious and ongoing effects as a result of his injury,' Mr Davis said.

The court heard the hospital trust had committed eight breaches of duty over 17 months after first acquiring the equipment in April 2011.

They included failing to provide adequate training to staff on how to use the equipment and not properly investigating two previous incidents, including one patient who received minor burns caused by the machine.

Mr Wilcock, who works for the Health and Safety Executive, is now pursuing a civil claim.

The trust's medical director Dr Paul Sigston offered a direct apology to Mr Wilcock and his wife Eileen when he appeared in the witness box during today's hearing.

He said: 'I'd like to express to Mr and Mrs Wilcock that I'm deeply sorry this event occurred.

'I'm aware of the harm and stress impacted on their lives.'

Mr Wilcock, left,  who is a health and safety inspector, said the September 2012 incident changed his 'perception of life' and has left him with permanent scarring to his buttock and hip area, right 

After the hearing, Mr Wilcock, from Tunbridge Wells, said his injuries had 'significantly' affected his life, as he raised concerns that other hospitals using the equipment may not have trained staff properly.

'I have changed my perception of life,' he said. 'I have scars that will last for the rest of my life, causing pain and discomfort.

'This equipment is used in lots of hospitals. That worries me. Are other hospitals using the equipment training their staff to use it properly?

'How could two previous patients have suffered minor injuries and not be noticed? How many other hospitals has that happened?

'I have no personal animosity for the individuals concerned. I know they have been personally upset by the incident.

'If I had been a child or a vulnerable older adult, we could have been talking about a death because of the seriousness of the burn.'

Malcolm Fortune QC, representing the trust, said the introduction of the hot dog equipment - which is no longer used by the trust - would have saved the organisation £250,000 over five years but he denied it was brought in as a 'cost-cutting exercise.'

The case had already cost the deficit-hit trust around £100,000 and a fine of between £200,000 and £300,000 should be considered, he added.

Mr Justice Sweeney said he would determine the amount the hospital will pay at Maidstone Crown Court next Thursday.

Addressing Mr Wilcock, the judge said: 'I'm extremely sorry that you have undergone this very, very, very unhappy experience.'
