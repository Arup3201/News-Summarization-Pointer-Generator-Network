Clayton Derrell Lockett: Took 43 minutes to die when he was executed last week

Last Tuesday evening, a 38-year-old man called Clayton Derrell Lockett was led into the execution chamber at Oklahoma state penitentiary.

The sentence he was due to receive had been handed down 14 years ago, for the horrific crime of torturing, shooting and burying alive teenager Stephanie Neiman.

Unsurprisingly, on the day of his death, Lockett spent his last hours being extremely unco-operative with those who were to kill him. That morning, he had refused to be taken for an X-ray, and his guards were forced to stun him with a Taser.

When he finally reached the medical centre, it was found that Lockett had earlier cut his own arm — perhaps as a way of trying to cheat his executioners by taking his own life. Despite the condemned man’s truculence, the grim routine of an execution continued unchecked.

During the afternoon, Lockett was asked what he wanted for his final meal. He requested a chateau- briand steak, but it was turned down because it exceeded the $15 budget for last meals.

He was offered a steak from a local fast-food joint, but declined.

In the chamber, Lockett was asked if he had final words, to which he answered simply: ‘No.’ At 6.23pm, he was strapped down, covered in a white sheet, and then the process of killing him began.

In Oklahoma, executions are carried out by a series of injections, which is considered the most ‘humane’ method. Under normal circumstances, a combination of three drugs is used.

First, the prisoner is given an anaesthetic or powerful sedative.

Second, another drug paralyses the body, which is swiftly followed by a third, which stops the heart.

This method has been used many times, and it has been shown to be grimly effective, and — reportedly in most cases — painless.

However, last Tuesday, the execution would be a little different. Instead of using a traditional drug to sedate Lockett, it was announced that a substitute would be used.

As any medic will tell you, it is hard to predict how the body will react to certain combinations of drugs. As a result, the prison authorities were a little apprehensive, since this new ‘protocol’ for executing a prisoner had never been tried.

Observers were warned that the process might take a little longer than usual.

That was an understatement. At 6.33, ten minutes after he was first injected, Lockett was declared to be unconscious. However, three minutes later, the condemned man started to struggle violently, thrashing around and writhing against his restraints.

He was even heard to say the word: ‘Man.’ Alarmed, the prison authorities drew the blinds so that the observers could not see what was quickly becoming all too apparent — the execution was being botched, and Lockett was in agony.

In the end, it took Lockett 43 minutes to die. Death, it was announced, was finally brought about by a ‘massive heart attack’.

Robert Patton, the director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, later revealed what had gone wrong. ‘We’ve had a vein failure in which the chemicals did not make it into the offender,’ he said. ‘His vein exploded.’

Although the precise details are still not clear, it appears that the authorities had to administer the sedative via a catheter into Lockett’s groin, after which they were finally able to inject him with the second and third drugs.

Mary Fallin, Oklahoma’s Governor, immediately ordered a halt to 54 planned executions, and demanded ‘an independent review’ into how the state executes those on Death Row.

Around the world, opinion was divided, as it always is with the death penalty.

‘Why should we give him a humane death when he didn’t give his victim a humane death?’ asked one Oklahoma defence lawyer. ‘I think that’s a basic instinct.’

On the other side of the debate was the United Nations.

A spokesman for the High Commissioner for Human Rights declared that the execution  process may have amounted to ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’ under international human rights law.

Also adding their voice to those who condemned the execution was a London-based organisation called Reprieve UK, which campaigns worldwide for the abolition of capital punishment.

‘States need to stop conducting secretive, experimental executions,’ said Maya Foa, head of Reprieve’s Death Penalty team.

Ms Foa, a 30-year-old former teacher, then launched an attack on companies that supplied the drugs used for executions.

‘It is a clear demonstration of why no responsible pharmaceutical firm or pharmacy wants to get involved in selling drugs to executioners,’ she said.

‘How many more of these horrifying events will it take before the authorities in Oklahoma and elsewhere get the message?’

However, what Ms Foa — unsurprisingly — failed to mention was that Lockett’s execution might never have been botched had it not been for Reprieve.

For the past four years, Reprieve has been vigorously lobbying governments and pharmaceutical companies to stop supplying the U.S. Department of Corrections with drugs for executions.

The campaign has been so successful that it has brought near chaos to the U.S. justice system, as it has been denied supplies of the tried and tested drugs.

As a direct consequence, the authorities have had to test new ‘protocols’ on their condemned prisoners — some of which have produced agonising and unnecessarily drawn-out deaths.

The botched execution of Clayton Lockett follows a similarly mishandled execution in January in Ohio, when it took a 53-year-old rapist and murderer called Dennis McGuire nearly half an hour to die, during which time he was clearly contorted in agony. Had the authorities had access to their normal drugs, it is likely McGuire’s execution would have passed in much the same way as that of the 52 other Ohio prisoners killed by lethal injections.

In fact, of the 1,300 prisoners the U.S. has executed since it restored the death penalty in the Seventies, nearly 1,200 have been killed by lethal injection.

Reprieve’s campaign, Stop the Lethal Injection Project (SLIP) started in 2010.

In October of that year, the organisation discovered that a British firm, Archimedes Pharma UK, had made — but not knowingly supplied — the drug that was used in the execution in Arizona of a murderer called Jeffrey Landrigan.

Reprieve lobbied the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, to impose  an export ban on the chemical. At first, Cable did not agree, but then, at the end of November 2010, the Business Secretary acquiesced.

The director of Reprieve, Clive Stafford Smith, a high-profile British lawyer who has contested numerous death penalty cases in the U.S., clearly regarded this as a triumph for his campaign.

‘All politicians should be congratulated when they admit a mistake,’ he said, ‘and it is a credit to Vince Cable that he has backed down.’

But Reprieve was not going to stop there. Shortly afterwards, the group was tipped off that the Arizona Department of Corrections had been charged £4,528.25 in September 2010 for the supply of drugs normally used in executions by a company based in Acton, West London, called Dream Pharma.

It is fair to say that Dream Pharma is not a pharmaceutical giant. In fact, its offices are based behind a shabby shop front for the Elgone Driving Academy. A tatty blue sign in the window states that it is also the home for Dream Pharma.

The company is run by Mehdi Alavi, and in January 2010, he reported his firm as having an annual turnover of £844,229, with a pre-tax profit of £94,460.

Until the 2010 export ban, it was quite legal for Mr Alavi to supply the drugs, and there is no suggestion that he has ever acted outside the law.

When he was confronted by reporters at the time, Mr Alavi simply stated: ‘It does not matter what I do. I am not even going to comment on anything.’

Since then, Reprieve has successfully continued campaigning both in Britain and worldwide.

Towards the end of 2011, the EU also introduced an export ban. As a result, many U.S. states have found it almost impossible to obtain execution drugs.

Lobby group Reprieve have called for Vince Cable to to impose a ban on the chemical - which he first refused. He changed his mind in November 2010

Some are resorting to desperate measures to get hold of them, and Missouri has even imported drugs from Oklahoma — which goes against its own state laws.

With a shortage of drugs, some states are now considering resorting to the use of other methods of execution, some of which are far less humane than lethal injections.

In Tennessee, for example, the state legislature has passed a bill that permits its Department of Corrections to use the electric chair if no drugs can be found.

In Wyoming, one senator is demanding the return of firing squads.

Clearly, botched executions, the restoration of firing squads and electric chairs can all be regarded as constituting an enormously troubling — if unintended — fallout for Reprieve’s campaign.

Naturally, Ms Foa strenuously denies anything of the sort.

‘The execution of Clayton Lockett was not an example of the wrong type of drugs being used to kill someone, but a particularly horrendous demonstration of the fact that there is no such thing as a “humane” lethal injection execution,’ she told me.

‘It is a myth. Botched lethal injection executions have been happening since prisons started using medicines that were intended to help people to kill them instead.’

Whatever side of the debate people stand on, it is clear that in the future, judicial killings in the United States could become more like sinister experiments than executions.

No matter how unpalatable it sounds, it appears the road to a more hellish form of death has been paved by those with  good intentions.
