An Latin American singer has claimed that her life is finally back on track after she turned her back on medication and hired a faith healer to exorcise demons.

Sabrina Sabrok, who currently lives  in Mexico, said her life was falling apart earlier this year when she had checked in to a clinic in the capital  to be treated for depression and panic attacks.

But the 38-year-old felt the medication she was put on while being treated in Mexico City were not really helping, and in desperation she turned to faith healer Zulema.

Sabrina Sabrok, 38, who currently lives in Mexico, said her life was falling apart earlier this year when she had checked in to a clinic in the capital to be treated for depression and panic attacks

The Argentine blonde, who has appeared on several television shows including the Mexican version of Celebrity Big Brother, said Zulema had told her that she was 'possessed'. 

So Sabrina hired the healer and her helpers to help her, and then carried out a dramatic exorcism in a local cemetery, which was captured on film.

The video shows her screaming, swearing and shouting, with many people suggesting the exorcism looked more like a low budget horror movie.

But Sabrina, who has also hosted her own television show on TeleHit, said she doesn't care what her critics think as the faith healer had helped her get her life back on track.

Zulema said: 'I am really pleased that the exorcism helped and drove the demons out of her.'

Things are now looking up for Sabrina - born as Lorena Fabiana Colotta - as she went on to perform with 37-year-old Mexican singer and actress Ivonne Soto.

Last week, the singer took to the stage in Cancun where she revealed she has a new boyfriend named Edson.

She said: 'You can't imagine how much pleasure he has brought me, my life is now really back on track.'
