Charged: Lawrence Reed, pictured, has been charged with the murder of Marco McMillian

A 22-year-old Clarksdale man has today been charged with the murder of Mississippi's first openly gay mayoral candidate whose body was found dumped on a riverbank.

Lawrence Reed was taken into custody yesterday as a 'person of interest' in the shocking slaying of rising political star Marco McMillian, 34, who was found dead on the Mississippi River levee at around 9am on Tuesday.

This afternoon, Coahoma County Sheriff's Office formally charged the man who was allegedly driving McMillian's SUV when it was involved in a head-on crash just before the candidate's body was discovered.

The relationship between the two men is unclear.

An autopsy report on McMillian's cause of death is expected later today.

According to the pressregister.com, Reed, an associate at the Motor Club of America, was injured in the crash but provided police with the location of McMillian's body.

Coahoma
County Coroner Scotty Meredith confirmed the body belonged to 
McMillian, a dedicated Democrat who was running to become mayor of 
Clarksdale.

Campaign 
supporters and residents paid tribute to the politician as a dedicated 
community activist and a legitimate candidate for office.

'We remember Marco as a bold and passionate public servant, whose faith informed every aspect of his life,' his campaign manager, Jarod Keith, said in a statement. 'Tragically, that life has been cut short.'

The politician's body was found between Sherard and Rena Lara. Authorities 
had been looking for McMillian who was reported missing after the early morning crash.

Political ambitions: Marco McMillian was running as a democrat candidate for mayor of Clarksdale. Supporters said the politician, pictured right with President Obama, could have gone all the way

The 
sheriff's office said deputies responded to the two-car crash on U.S. 
Highway 49 South near the Coahoma and Tallahatchie county lines at about 8 a.m.

Clarksdale, a town of around 17,8000 people, is well known for its blues music heritage. Morgan Freeman famously co-owns the Ground Zero Blues Club with Howard Stovall, a Memphis 
entertainment executive, and Bill Luckett, who also is running for 
mayor.

It is well-known to blues fans as the home 
of the crossroads, where Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul to
the devil for skills with a guitar.

McMillian
was hoping to win the office being vacated by Mayor Henry Espy Jr., the
brother of Mike Espy, a former congressman and U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary.

Henry Espy decided not to seek re-election after more than 
two decades in office.

Espy's son, state Rep. Chuck Espy, is also running.

Fans and friends of McMillian, whose 
Facebook account features a picture of him alongside President Obama, paid tribute to him this week.

Dennis Thomas, 33, who works at Abe's Barbeque, said: 'There's
a lot of people upset about it. Why would somebody want to do something
like that to somebody of that caliber?

'He was a highly respected person
in town. He's been in the community helping out a lot.'

Norman Van Collins Sr took to Facebook to say the party had lost a future star.

'I am definitely praying for the family as well as sharing their grief,' he said. 
'Marco was like a son to me, and I so looked forward to his campaign and 
his ultimately becoming the next mayor of my hometown Clarksdale which 
so desperately needs leadership such that of Marco. He was definitely 
POTUS potential.'

The
Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund and Institute said there 'hearts go 
out to the family and friends of Marco McMillian'.

McMillian
was CEO of MWM & Associates, described on its website as a 
consulting firm for non-profit organizations. He had recently served as 
international executive director of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity Inc.

Jimmy
Hammock, the fraternity's international president, praised McMillian in
a Facebook post for making 'an incredible difference in his community 
and in Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity'.

A statement
from the historically black fraternity said he had secured the first 
federal contract to 'raise the awareness of the adverse impact of 
HIV/AIDS on communities of color for the Fraternity'.

It noted that 
Ebony Magazine had recognized him in 2004 as one of the nation's '30 
up-and-coming African Americans' under age 30.

McMillian
also worked at Alabama A&M University and Jackson State University 
in the past.
