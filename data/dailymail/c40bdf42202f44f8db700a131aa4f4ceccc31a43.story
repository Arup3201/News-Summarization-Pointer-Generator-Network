Passengers aboard an easyJet flight claim they had to organise an impromptu whip-round to persuade people to disembark after the pilot said they couldn't take off because there were too many heavy men on board.

The 7.05am flight from Liverpool's John Lennon Airport to Geneva was delayed by an hour-and-a-half because the plane was 300kg overweight due to an 'exceptionally high proportion of male passengers'.

Engineer Simon Lay - who was onboard 
the plane to go on a skiing holiday - said the pilot struggled to find volunteers because the airline was only offering £100 compensation.

So a collection tin was passed around the cabin until enough money had been raised to persuade four people to disembark.

Mr
Lay said a group of passengers at the front of the plane made up the 
compensation to £200 per person which was enough to persuade four 
passengers off the flight.

He said the rest of the passengers then had a whip-round to help reimburse the out-of-pocket passengers at the front. easyJet said the plane was over regulatory limits due to there being an "exceptionally high proportion of male passengers'.

Whip-round: Passengers on board said they had to organise a whip-round as the airline was only offering £100 compensation which was not enough to persuade people to disembark

The company insisted it was not its 
policy to allow whip-rounds and that 'as far as we can establish no 
other arrangements between passengers were made'.

The four passengers were driven to Birmingham and put on another flight to Geneva which arrived at 2.30pm UK time. Mr Lay, 40, said: 'The whip-round certainly happened, I put two quid in. I saw other people throwing in fivers.

'It is ridiculous and embarrassing for easyJet. I was going on a skiing trip with friends and we paid more for the early flight so we could get some more skiing time in.

'They announced that the plane was 300kg overweight and the pilot asked for volunteers to get off.

'At first they offered £100 compensation and a Friday flight but nobody wanted that. Then they changed it to a flight from Birmingham the same day. A group at the front of the plane made it up to £200 to persuade four people to get off.

'The rest of the passengers then put a few quid in to help them out."

easyJet said in a statement: "easyJet can confirm that flight EZY7279 from Liverpool - Geneva was above regulatory weight limits due to an exceptionally high proportion of male passengers and more hold luggage than usual.

"In these circumstances volunteers are required to offload and easyJet offers passengers £100 in compensation and alternative flights. Four volunteers came forward and the flight departed shortly afterwards.

"As far as we can establish no other arrangements between passengers were made. easyJet has policies in place to deal with this situation and so there is no need for passengers to take this kind of action.

"The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority and the airline always complies with all regulations."
