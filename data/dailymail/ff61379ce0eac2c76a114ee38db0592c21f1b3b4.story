John Legend and Chrissy Teigen have opened the doors to their $2.5 million downtown Manhattan loft in the latest issue of Architectural Digest.

The couple moved into the one-bedroom apartment on the border of New York City's Little Italy and Nolita neighborhoods prior to their September 2013 wedding, telling the magazine that they were attracted to the space's dark, moody atmosphere.

'We tend to look for the opposite of what most people want,' Mr Legend, 36, said, noting that most apartment hunters are seeking natural light.

Ms Teigen, 29, added that she 'absolutely loved' the brick wall which sits just beyond her kitchen window, insisting: 'I’d rather have a wall than a view of the Empire State Building.'

The pair commissioned Don Stewart of the Los Angeles-based firm Desiderata Design to work on the space, after Mr Stewart designed their LA home.

'John and Chrissy both work insanely hard,' Mr Stewart said. 'This needed to be a place where the two of them could power down and recharge.'

The couple's favorite part of the apartment is the large kitchen; Ms Teigen said it was important for her to have an open space in which to cook, drink wine and watch TV, all at the same time.

Mr Legend said the couple - who own three bulldogs, Pippa, Penny and Puddy - had wanted 'a place that was much more homey and had more soul to it'.

Ms Teigen added: 'This apartment just embodies everything that I love. I love dark and rustic, but it's still very clean and very chic. It feels like our place in LA, but in New York.'

Happy couple: Mr Legend and Ms Teigen, seen here in September, met in 2006 and became engaged in 2011

The couple recently sold their Hollywood Hills house for $2 million.

They purchased the Little Italy home, which is 1,969 square feet, for $2,494,712 in February 2013 after selling Mr Legend's previous New York City apartment in the East Village in late 2012.

Mr Legend, who has won nine Grammys, met the Sports Illustrated model in 2006 while shooting the video for his hit single Stereo. They became engaged in 2011.
