Polish workers are returning to Britain seeking employment, lured back by higher salaries.

For the first time since the financial crash, official figures have shown a rise in the number of Poles living in the UK.

About 45,000 people from the east European country were recorded as settling in Britain last year, despite the fact the UK is still in the grip of a recession.

Despite the fact the Polish economy is experiencing a strong growth, it is believed many are leaving their home country because wages are low.

Even with the prospect of work being harder to find in the UK - where 2.5million people are unemployed - they can still earn more when they do find a job, the Telegraph reported.

Visas for students from Asia and Africa are being restricted in bid to curb immigration numbers, but anyone from the EU can move the UK after borders were relaxed under Labour.

According to the Telegraph, the report from Poland's Central Statistics Office said: 'Among the countries that for years now have been a main destination for Poles, the UK has seen a significant rise in migrants.'

Maciej Bukowski, from Warsaw's Institute of Structural Research, told the Telegraph: 'The primary reason for migrating is a chance to get paid far more than you do in Poland, even if it means coping with a higher cost of living.'

Average earnings of £2,000 a month in the UK dwarfs the typical wage of £635 in Poland.

Even after shelling out for the higher cost of living in the UK, there is still more money to be saved.

One Polish woman, named only as Barbara, has lived in England for seven years and said her average monthly wage in her home country was just £153.

She told the Telegraph: 'When I arrived in the UK I worked as a cleaner and I'm now director of the company.

'In Poland, if I wanted to pay all the bills and have a little left over for fun, I worked out I needed £765 a month.'
