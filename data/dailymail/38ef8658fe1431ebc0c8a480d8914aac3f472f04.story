The UK Independence Party today claimed it was on the verge of an electoral earthquake after storming to second place in the South Shields by-election.

Labour held the seat vacated by former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, but UKIP doubled its vote share to 24 per cent, pushing the Tories into third and the Lib Dems slumping to a humiliating seventh just ahead of the Monster Raving Loony Party.

UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall said his party was knocking on the door to Westminster and 'soon we will kick that door in'.

UKIP surged into second place halving the Labour majority to less than 5,000 votes

UKIP is also making big gains in local elections across England, taking votes from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems.

In South Shields, UKIP secured 24 per cent of the 
vote as Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck held the seat with a reduced majority 
of 6,505.

The result proved
 disastrous for the Liberal Democrats, who came seventh and lost their 
deposit, and also bad for the Conservatives who picked up 11.5 per cent 
of the vote.

Mr Nuttall said: 'It shows we are a 
party on an upward trajectory, that we are going places and it also 
shows that we are not just a southern-based party taking votes from the 
Conservatives, we are taking votes in the north as well.

'We
 have been knocking on the door of Westminster now for the past two 
years, and very soon we will kick that door in and once we get one, 
we'll get two, we'll get four and then we'll be in there and things will
 change forever,' he told the BBC.

The South Shields contest was 
triggered by former foreign secretary David Miliband's decision to quit 
politics and head to the United States to lead an international charity.

Labour's majority was reduced from 
the 11,109 achieved by Mr Miliband and the 50.5 per cent share of the vote was 
the party's lowest in the safe seat since 1083.

UKIP candidate Richard Elvin said: 'It's an absolutely fantastic result for UKIP.

'To come from nowhere to take 25 per cent at its first attempt is absolutely stunning.

'It's a message to all three mainstream parties that UKIP is the official opposition. We have proved that in Labour strongholds and we have done it again in South Shields.'

David Miliband congratulated his successor in a message on Twitter. He wrote: 'Congrats @EmmaLewellBuck and Labour team in Southshields. Holding 50% of vote very good result.'

The Labour winner, a married social worker, was cheered by supporters as she became the first female MP in South Shields.

From the podium, she said: 'I will help get people back to work, champion our wonderful town and never give the Tory Government one moment's peace.'

But Lib Dem Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he thought the Labour winner's victory speech was 'stage-managed' and 'phoney'.

He told BBC News: 'I was watching the Labour by-election winner from South Shields on television this morning and I have no bone to pick with her - I have never met her in my life - but it was the most stage-managed, phoney, inauthentic political display that you could ever see on television.

"She just repeated all the same mantras about millionaires and bedrooms and I thought, doesn't she have any views of her own?

'Why isn't the Labour Party letting her speak? Why isn't there any authenticity in this whole stage-managed occasion?'

Mr Browne said the three main parties needed to respond to the UKIP surge by thinking 'a bit differently about how we do politics as well as the policies'.

UKIP is on course to win 100 council seats after local elections were held across the country

BNP candidate Lady Dorothy Macbeth Brookes beat the Lib Dems' Hugh Annand, who finished seventh

Voters have gone to the polls in 34 
council contests across England, plus the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, 
with an eligible electorate of around 40 per cent of the UK total.

A UKIP source said 'we are expecting a
 cracking night' and the party would 'triple or quadruple our vote from 
2009' when the council seats were last contested.

The dire result for the Lib Dems is just the latest poor showing for the Nick Clegg's party which built its success on winning by-elections before joining the coalition.

Its one notable success was clinging on in Eastleigh, but the other 13 by-elections contested since May 2010 make for grim reading:Oldham East and Saddleworth: 2nd (vote share +0.3%)

Barnsley Central: 5th (-13.1%) Lost deposit

Leicester South: 2nd (-4.4%)

Inverclyde: 4th (-11.1%) Lost deposit

Feltham and Heston: 3rd (-7.9%)

Bradford West: 4th (-7.1%) Lost deposit

Cardiff South and Penarth: 3rd (-11.4%)

Corby: 4th (-9.5%) Lost deposit

Manchester Central: 2nd (-17.2%)

Croydon North: 4th (-10.5%) Lost deposit

Middlesbrough: 3rd (-10%)

Rotherham: 8th (-13.9%) Lost deposit

Eastleigh: 1st (-14.5%)

South Shields: 7th (-12.8%) Lost deposit)

Nigel Farage's party became the second largest party in Lincolnshire as the Conservatives lost control of the authority.

They
 won 16 seats in Lincolnshire, 10 in Hampshire, nine in Essex, three in 
Gloucestershire, three in Somerset and one in Dorset.

Overnight counts took place at six authorities which were held by the Tories before the election.

The
 Conservatives retained control in Dorset, Essex, Hampshire and - 
narrowly - Somerset, where they lost five seats and the Liberal 
Democrats lost four.

But
 as well as in Lincolnshire, they were ousted from overall control in 
Gloucestershire, where there were four gains for Labour and three for 
UKIP.

Labour's Norma 
Redfearn ousted incumbent Tory Linda Arkley in the battle to be mayor of
 North Tyneside. Results elsewhere will be announced later today.

The father of Tory MP Priti Patel took second place standing under the UKIP banner in a Hertfordshire County poll.

Sushil Kantibhai Patel was running under that party's description on the ballot paper at Bushey South.

He came more than 1,200 votes behind Conservatives but ahead of Labour and Liberal Democrats.

Last night Tory International Development 
Secretary Justine Greening said UKIP did not have any 'substance' and 
insisted the Government was listening to people's concerns.

Appearing on BBC1's Question Time, 
she said: 'I think as people take more of a look at UKIP they will be 
able to form their own opinion about whether there is any substance 
underneath the policies.

'I personally don't think that there is but I think it's up to voters to decide, obviously.'

Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman 
told the programme UKIP's rise was a 'wake-up call' for the 
establishment parties, but some of its politics were 'quite 
threatening'.

She said: 'We should listen very 
seriously if people are feeling disaffected and disenchanted. It is a 
challenge to us. It's a wake-up call for us to actually listen to people
 who feel that times are hard and wonder whether any of us have actually
 got the answers.'

But she added: 'I don't take the easy
 assumption 'Oh well, it's great because it's going to take votes off 
the Conservatives'.

'I think some of their politics is quite threatening 
and we shouldn't be complacent either.'

Labour won the South Shields by-election but the result was marked by surge in the vote for UKIP

UKIP candidate Richard Elvin polled almost 6,000 votes, halving the Labour majority to only 5,000

Lib Dem veteran Baroness Williams of Crosby told the programme UKIP would not 'last that long' as a political force.

She said: 'I may be wrong, but I 
think what they are doing essentially is trading on protest and they 
don't have anything very solid to say about the problems that really 
face the country.'

After the win, the new MP Emma Lewell-Buck said: 'UKIP did make inroads but ultimately the people of South Shields have spoken and they want a Labour MP.'

Her background in social work meant she had seen people living with poverty under a Labour government she said.

'I have seen how people live under a Coalition Government and are really struggling, and I want to make a difference.'
