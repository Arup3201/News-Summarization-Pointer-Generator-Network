One of the greatest and divisive romances of all time, the relationship between Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, which saw the newly crowned king give up his throne for the American divorcee, continues to captivate the nation.

Now a historic velvet settee where the two started their love affair is to be auctioned.

The blush two-seater couch, measuring 60inch wide, has been restored to its former glory ahead of the auction, where it is expected to fetch between £2,000 and £3,000.

Edward and Wallis, seen left on their wedding day, and, right, outside Goverment House in Nassau, the Bahamas, circa 1942, had one of the most controversial romances of modern times

When Lady Thelma - Edward's former girlfriend - discovered his love for Simpson she cut the sofa in revenge

The settee was owned by Lady Thelma Furness, Edward's girlfriend at the time, who introduced the pair during a party at her Burrough Court house in Leicestershire in 1931.

The Prince of Wales, Lady Furness and Simpson would often talk together on the then three-seater couch, according to Northamptonshire-based auctioneer Jonathan Humbert.

But when it was revealed the future king wanted to marry Simpson, Lady Furness cut up the sofa in revenge, he said.

Now the seat is to be sold by auctioneers J P Humbert on May 22.

Mr Humbert said: 'Every once in a while, something truly remarkable is offered for sale.

After refusing to give Wallis - who, being twice divorced was considered unsuitable for a king - up, Edward eventually abdicated the throne in favour of his brother

'This is one such item - this is a true one off complete with provenance.

'This really is the original "seat of love" where arguably the greatest love affair of the 20th century began.

'Nobody knew it at a time, but this settee was set to change the course of history.'

In 1934 Edward transferred his affections from Lady Furness to Simpson, who had recently divorced her husband Ernest after years of living 'beyond their means'.

Lady Thelma had been visiting New York with her family, and on discovering Edward and Wallis’s new relationship cut down the seat to two seats.

The sofa has been restored from the frame up and has been re-upholstered in period blush pink velvet.

Included in the auction lot is a DVD with images of the restoration a former auction catalogue with ‘Borough Court’ provenance.

The twice-divorced Simpson was consider totally inappropriate for a reigning monarch to marry

Few
 could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American 
socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the
 Royal Family has ever faced.

But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king.

The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love.

At
 first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for 
his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died
 on January 20, 1936.

When,
 the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of 
his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he 
intended to marry her.

This
 precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment 
considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, 
because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time,
 did not allow marriages between divorcees.

Edward
 suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson 
becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and
 South Africa rejected the plan.

By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country.

Despite
 attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on December 
13, 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII.

The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the June 3, 1937 in the south of France.

Although
 Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was 
entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the 
honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'
