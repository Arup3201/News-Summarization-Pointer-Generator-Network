A 23-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a seven-year-old girl.

Nottinghamshire Police were called to a house in the Bestwood Park area of Nottingham at around 5.10am today after concerns were raised about the child.

She has been named locally as aspiring police officer Kay-Ann Morris.

A shocked neighbour described the church-goer as 'strict' and said that the tragic youngster was a 'stunning little girl'.

The neighbour, who gave his name only as Geoff, said: 'I did not know a lot about her, and nor did anyone here.

'She did her best to keep herself to herself and I think she had two little girls.

'The only time you would see them was when they were going to or coming back from school.

'She was a beautiful little girl, just a stunning little girl, it is so sad that she has gone.

'She was very shy, very quiet, it was obvious she was under a strict regime.

'I know that about eight police cars and at least two ambulances were there at the time.

'I saw the man and Kay-Ann being led out by police to the van and a little girl being carried out wrapped in a blanket.

'It is all so tragic, there has never been any trouble around here. The lady once had a bit of an argument with a neighbour who doesn't live here any more.

'That was over children throwing snow balls, and didn't last long.

'I think I am going to go and get some flowers now as it is just so sad. Nothing like this happens around here. It's a nice area.'

A neighbour described the woman as a 'strict' and the little girl as 'quiet'

A spokesman for the Seventh Day Advent Church in Nottingham said Morris had attended their church. 

It is believed Morris had been an aspiring police officer and was featured as part of a special Nottinghamshire Police programme to get more young people to join the force when she was 17.

Speaking at the time Kay-Ann said: 'From the age of four I've aspired to become a police officer and being on Tap The Gap has strengthened my drive and determination to pursue my chosen career.

'It has also given me a new found self- confidence.'

A 47-year-old man has also been arrested on suspicion of assault.

Post-mortem tests are due to take place later, a force spokeswoman said.

She declined to comment on whether the pair, who remain in police custody, are related to the child.
