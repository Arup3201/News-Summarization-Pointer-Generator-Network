It was always one of the most unconventional relationships in showbusiness – and now, after 13 years, it has come to an end.

Helena Bonham Carter, the Merchant Ivory English rose, has split from her partner, the eccentric American film director Tim Burton, best known for writing and directing romantic fantasy film Edward Scissorhands.

A spokesman for the couple tells me: ‘Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children. We would ask that you respect their privacy and that of their children during this time.’

Struggling: Bonham Carter appeared to be a touch worse for wear in the early hours of Friday

The revelation comes after a slightly dishevelled Bonham Carter was seen leaving a party last week without her husband.

There were signs their relationship was in trouble last year, when Burton, 56, was pictured embracing a mystery blonde, thought to be one of his assistants, near his home in Hampstead.

At the time the couple refused to comment. Recently, though, the stress has clearly proved too much to bear, as evidenced by Helena’s appearance last week. But it is not the first time concern has been raised about her wellbeing.

A strange situation?: In September 2013 Tim was allegedly caught with a blonde lady after a dinner date in London; Carter later said the report was 'nonsense'

‘Helena was very upset at the Chequers party earlier this month hosted by Samantha Cameron,’ says a friend. ‘Other guests noticed she was in a bad way. She is really upset. It’s all still very raw and they only told the children two weeks ago.’

Another friend says: ‘Tim is having a classic mid-life crisis. All Helena’s friends think he’s a terrible old cliche. Helena gave him a lot of time to sort himself out.’

The self-confessed ‘bonkers couple’ famously do not share a home, instead living next door to each other in north London with their children, Billy Ray, ten, and Nell, six. ‘The houses are joined,’ Bonham Carter has explained.

‘He always visits, which is really touching. He’s always coming over. We have a throughway. Journalists think there’s an underground tunnel, gothic. It’s actually quite above ground, lots of light.’

She admitted, however, they only share a bed ‘sometimes’ because of ‘a snoring issue’. ‘I talk, he snores. The other thing is, he’s an insomniac, so he needs to watch television to get to sleep. I need silence.’

The couple have collaborated on more than seven films since they met on the set of 2001’s Planet of the Apes, which Burton directed. ‘You were the first person I thought of to play a chimpanzee,’ he told her at the time.

Often described as his ‘muse’, Bonham Carter, 48, went on to star in his films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows. In that time she morphed from a self-described ‘corset bimbo’ into playing darker roles.

She is currently reprising her role as the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass, which Burton is producing.

Once she got together with the scruffy Burton her public image was transformed and she became increasingly renowned for her bizarre dress sense.

‘I feel like I have a reputation to keep,’ Bonham Carter once said of her outlandish outfits. ‘I have a responsibility now to dress badly – so it’s kind of liberating.’ Working with her partner, however, took its toll. ‘It’s not without its pressures, working with Tim,’ she said in 2010 following their work on the first Alice in Wonderland film, which Burton also directed.

‘It worked on Alice. Sweeney was very stressful, very hard on our relationship. He’s a partner in our private life, but when he’s directing, he’s the boss. And maybe I confuse that.’

In 2005 Bonham Carter, great-granddaughter of Liberal prime minister Herbert Asquith, also described the director as being on the autistic spectrum.

‘Tim will kill me, but while making this drama I realised he has a bit of Asperger’s in him, you start recognising the signs. We were watching a documentary about autism and he said that was how he felt as a child.’

With their children: Together the former power couple have an 11-year-old son Billy and daughter Nell, aged seven; here they are all pictured in November at London's Winter Wonderland

It is perhaps telling that Burton has just released his first directorial live-action feature in 13 years that doesn’t star the actress. Big Eyes, which is out this week, instead has Amy Adams in the lead role.

Burton was previously married to German-born artist Lena Gieseke for four years although the couple separated in 1991 when he moved in with model and actress Lisa Marie Smith.

Before Burton, Bonham Carter embarked on a relationship with Sir Kenneth Branagh while he was still married to Emma Thompson after co-starring with him in 1994 film Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.

The couple separated in 1999. They were professionally reunited earlier this year after he directed her in the Disney film Cinderella, in which she plays the fairy godmother.

In the early hours of Friday morning Bonham Carter was seen leaving PR man Matthew Freud’s Christmas Party – apparently a little worse for wear – alongside Angus Deayton and his wife.

However, she and Burton spent Saturday together, attending a production of Cats in the West End.

The Sunday Times Rich List last year claimed the couple had a combined wealth of £80million
