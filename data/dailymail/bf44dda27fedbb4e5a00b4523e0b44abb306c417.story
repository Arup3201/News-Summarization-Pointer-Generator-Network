Nene appears to be enjoying London life following his move to West Ham if his latest Instagram post is anything to go by.

The tricky winger is yet to start a game for the Hammers but he'll be hoping he can get a chance against London rivals Arsenal on Saturday.

The Brazilian posted a photo on the social media site with the roof down of his expensive Bentley and commented on the lovely London sun.

The Brazilian will be hoping he can earn a start in the next few weeks with winnable fixtures coming up

He said: 'Beautiful sunny day on London,' which will remind him of the glorious weather he would of been used to at his old club Al-Gharafa in Qatar.

Sam Allardyce's side know they need to start winning games if they're to regain their place in the European places.

Without a win in six Premier League games, they face a tough task at the Emirates Stadium but with teams around them picking up points, they know that losing isn't an option.
