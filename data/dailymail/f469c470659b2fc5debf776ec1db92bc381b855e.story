With a serene turquoise glow glimmering from beneath, and icy blue radiance from within, they appear otherworldly.

But these spellbinding icebergs, stunningly captured by American photographer Michael Leggero, are very much of earth.

The 43-year-old eco-environmental photographer spent two days and nights battling constant 40 to 80-foot waves in the Drake Passage, the body of water between the southern tip of South America and the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica, to get to the icebergs.

Michael said: 'When I photograph icebergs I feel awestruck. The water shapes each piece of ice into its own piece of art.

Spellbinding: Photographer Michael Leggero has captured these images of icebergs in Antarctica

Otherworldly: The eco-environmental photographer says that people often show disbelief that the icebergs really look in real life as they do in his stunning photographs

Remote: The majestic icebergs are located in the Drake Passage, between the southern tip of South America and the South Shetland Islands 

'My images show pure nature, as that is how I describe Antarctica, simply pure nature,' the photographer, of Carthage, New York, said.

'It is the only place on our planet that humans have not left a presence behind.

'Every iceberg is different, the majesty of the size, the smoothness of the lines and curves, it's just awe-inspiring.

'I've never seen a bad iceberg. They are all beautiful, and I show that beauty and elegance in my photography.'

Dedicated: Leggero spent two days and nights battling constant 40 to 80-foot waves to get to the icebergs

Beautiful light: The 43-year-old photographer, from New York says that a thunderstorm can make the already spectacular light even more incredible 

'Pure nature': Michael says his love of Antarctica is in part because 'it is the only place on our planet that humans have not left a presence behind'

Nature at its best: Leggero says he has never seen a 'bad iceberg' - they are all beautiful

Michael has travelled right to the high Arctic above the 80th parallel north, to below the Antarctic Peninsula, and often gets within touching distance of the icebergs he photographs.  

'The most common questions I hear are people wondering if the icebergs really do look like they do in my photographs, and the answer is yes.

'The light in some areas of icebergs really is spectacular and if you get a thunderstorm in the background it becomes even more incredible.

'Travelling through the ice is a feeling of relaxation and peace that I haven't found a comparison to anywhere else. In our fast paced lives, the serenity of floating between icebergs makes the rest of the world almost non-existent.'

Natural beauty: 'Every iceberg is different,' he says. 'The majesty of the size, the smoothness of the lines and curves'

Up close and personal: The adventurer often gets close enough to touch the icebergs he is photographing

Far and wide: Leggero has travelled to places including Hawaii, Alaska and Iceland to photograph landscaped, bird and animals

Photographing icebergs was never a goal of Leggero's, he reveals. 'As I started travelling the world I always explored areas that are sometimes difficult to access.

'Antarctica was never really number one on my list of places to visit until I sat in a photo lecture about how to use a certain type of software and the presenter was showing icebergs.

'I booked a last minute trip to Antarctica; barely survived the crossing of the rough waves of the Drake Passage, and the rest is history.'

Leggero has been a professional photographer and photographic instructor for over 20 years. He has travelled the world photographing landscapes, birds and animals with recent locations including Hawaii, Iceland and Alaska. 

Isolated: 'In our fast paced lives, the serenity of floating between icebergs makes the rest of the world almost non-existent,' says Michael

Storm at sea: Moody skies and dark waters often create the most mesmerising photographs

Life-changing: Michael had no plans to travel to Antarctica until attending a lecture that showed images of icebergs, after which he booked a last-minute ticket

Worth the effort: He reveals that he 'barely survived' the crossing due to the rough waves, but 'the rest is history'
