Angry customers criticised Marks & Spencer last night after Mother's Day flowers failed to arrive in time.

They complained that the store used beleaguered delivery firm Yodel, which has previously come under fire for struggling to deliver parcels during busy times.

M&S emailed some customers on Saturday and informed them that 'something had gone wrong' with their delivery and the flowers they had ordered would not arrive on time. 

Marks & Spencer customers have been left without Mother's Day flowers after the courier firm employed by the chain failed to deliver

Marks & Spencer confirmed that the Courier firm Yodel was responsible for a 'small number of delays to orders'

They have since had their money refunded. The retailer said Yodel was responsible for a 'small number of delays to orders', but insisted its delivery service had returned to normal yesterday.

However, many unhappy customers took to Twitter to vent their frustration yesterday as they claimed their mothers had been left without a gift on Mothering Sunday.

One woman posted: 'Thanks M&S for ruining Mother's Day. Where are the flowers my son ordered??!!!' Another tweeted: 'Whoever finds my M's Day flowers first can keep them', adding: 'According to GPS tracker, they were left in a layby.'

Others questioned why M&S was still using Yodel following a catalogue of high-profile issues in recent months.

One Twitter user said: '2.30pm and still no Yodel M&S flowers delivery. It rather ruins the surprise, having to let your mum know flowers were ordered but no sign.' 

Another asked: 'Why are M&S using Yodel to deliver flowers on Mother's Day?'. The delivery firm has been beset by claims of broken deliveries, and packages left in bins and hurled at doors.

An M&S spokesman said: 'The vast majority of orders were delivered on time on Saturday. For the small number of customers who had orders postponed to today we have offered a full refund and a gesture of goodwill. We expect a normal delivery service today.'

Yodel said it had handled over 400,000 Mother's Day flower deliveries for a number of retailers this year.

Dick Stead, Executive Chairman of Yodel said: 'We’ve handled over 400,000 Mother's Day flower deliveries for a number of retailers this year. We started deliveries on Friday and we worked all Sunday up until 6pm to ensure mums across the country got their gifts.'
