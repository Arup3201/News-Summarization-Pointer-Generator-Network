A thousand litres of body wash was spilt across six lanes on a busy road in Sydney's North on Wednesday morning. 

The spill occurred at approximately 11:30am on Pennant Hills Road and police were forced to close two of three northbound lanes.

A spokesperson from Fire and Rescue New South Wales told Daily Mail Australia that the truck carrying the liquid had reported a leak, however the Daily Telegraph has reported the vehicle was involved in a crash.

Only one crew of firefighters attended the scene where they diluted the body wash before handing the site over to police.

Bus services and drivers experienced lengthy delays, however no injuries were reported.

Fire and Rescue NSW chose to make light of the situation on their Twitter page where they posted: 'Firefighters have diluted 1000-litre body wash spill. 

'Northbound lanes reopened. Motorists no longer in a lather'.

Needless to say, drivers have been warned to beware of the slippery road conditions.
