A woman called Al Capone who  waged an alcohol-fuelled 'reign of terror' in her seaside town has been accused of breaching her ASBO just days after being handed it.

Alexandra 'Al' Capone, 40, from Worthing, West Sussex, was arrested after allegedly playing music so loudly it could be heard outside her £369,500 bright pink house -  just 11 days after being handed the two-year anti-social behaviour order.

The average monthly rent for the four-bedroom house, which was once a lifeboat station, is around £1,400. It is unclear if Capone rents or owns the property.  

Brighton Magistrates' Court heard previously that her alcohol-fuelled behaviour led to late-night drunken arguments and Capone shouting and swearing at her neighbours.

The ASBO bans Capone from 'causing a nuisance, alarm or distress to the public, using or threatening violence towards the public, being in possession of alcohol in a public place except on a licensed premises and being drunk in a public place.'

She is also not allowed to make a noise within her home which is loud enough to be heard outside and is banned from having more than two visitors entering her home between 10pm and 8am.

But officers have now arrested and charged her for breaching the ASBO imposed by magistrates for allegedly blaring out loud music which could be heard on the street outside her bright pink home.

She has been bailed to appear at Worthing Magistrates' Court on March 24.

A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: 'Alexandra Capone has been charged with breaching an anti-social behaviour order imposed by Brighton magistrates on February 24.

'The conditions of her ASBO state that she is not to play music loud enough to be heard outside her property.' 

Capone recently painted her 140-year-old house bright pink - much to the chagrin of some residents in the seaside town.

Richie Redman, 48, told The Argus the colour was 'disgusting' and 'completely out of character' with other buildings.

Other described it as 'an eyesore'. 

Capone is not believed to be related to the notorious gangster Al, who supplied alcohol to Americans during prohibition. 

The house was once a lifeboat house - but the plaque commemorating its history has also been painted
