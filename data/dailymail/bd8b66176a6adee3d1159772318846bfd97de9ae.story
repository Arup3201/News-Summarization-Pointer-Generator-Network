Missing: Avonte Oquendo, 14, ran away on October 4 and his remains could have been found

Authorities investigating whether remains found washed up on a New York beach belong to missing autistic teenager Avonte Oquendo have also found a skull, according to reports.

A decomposed torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker 
were found on a northern Queens beach last Thursday and authorities said
 the clothes were similar to those worn by the 14-year-old when he went 
missing in October.

Authorities told DNAinfo that searchers also found a head on Sunday and have now found most of the body. Ten teeth are missing, which could make it hard to identify the body through dental records.

But Avonte's family said they fear foul play if the body is his - because it was wearing unfamiliar underwear.

The family's lawyer, David Perecman, told the New York Post that he is concerned about the large Fruit of the Loom underwear found on the remains because Avonte didn't wear 'large' and wore only the Hanes brand.

'If it is him, what that indicates to me is that something happened,' Perecman said. 'Someone got a hold of him, moved him. I can't say they harmed him, but why would the underwear have gotten changed?'

The
 remains were taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively 
identified, and authorities are now awaiting the results of a DNA test. 
They could have an answer by Wednesday.

A police source confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared on October 4 from the Riverview School in Long Island City.

Search: An arm, torso and legs were discovered along the Queens shoreline on Thursday and authorities said the clothes found were similar to those worn by Avonte when he vanished three months ago

Hunt: An NYPD canine unit continues the search for human remains on Friday. Authorities said a DNA test this week will determine whether or not the remains belong to the missing teenager

Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo

Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing.

The Oquendo family were notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information.

The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen.

For months, the boy's family has 
organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing 
posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward.

In
 particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated 
with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even 
played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy.

The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care.

There have been a few sightings of 
teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - 
but he remains missing.

Fears: But David Perecman, the family's attorney, pictured, said the underwear found on the remains does not match the type that Avonte wore - leading his family to fear foul play

Avonte Oquendo disappeared from his Long Island City school, New York on October 4. The remains were found on a Queens beach nine miles from where he was last seen

On January 5, the family posted a message on the Facebook page that they have set up to help find the boy pleading for FBI involvement.

The message thanked volunteers for their continued help in looking for the missing teen over the winter holidays.

The
 message continued: 'We would like to clarify that we have sought the 
help of the FBI and had petitioned them to take the lead in the 
investigation regarding Avonte.

'There
 are several legal reasons they gave us for not being legally permitted 
to take over the investigation. The most noted is that the NYPD has 
listed Avonte as a missing person, not a victim of kidnapping or other 
such federal offense(s) that would require the FBI's involvement.

'It is our deepest desire for the FBI to get involved but there is a 
system in place that requires protocol, we cannot force the FBI to get 
involved and we continually ask and pray they do.'

Avonte Oquendo is seen on the street outside his school on October 4 before he turned the corner and disappeared out of sight

A Department of Education investigation has also taken place into how the autistic boy managed to get out of his special needs school and how teaching staff handled his disappearance.

Avonte's
 mother Vanessa, along with police, were not informed of his disappearance until
 at least an hour after he ran from the school building.

The
 school failed to go into lockdown mode while none of the administrators
 had passwords to access the surveillance cameras at the school on the 
day of Avonte's disappearance, according to Capital New York.

Without
 access to the security footage, school officials originally believed 
Avonte 'ran back up another staircase' and remained in the building.
