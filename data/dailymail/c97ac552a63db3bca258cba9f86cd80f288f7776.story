Sam Irwin-Hill was a long way from home when the University of Arkansas punter scored the cheekiest touchdown seen in recent years.

In the Arkansas U away game against Texas A&M Aggies this week, Bendigo born and raised Irwin-Hill was all lined up to punt from just inside his half of the field.

Instead, after the block formed a clear flank for the Australian native, he took his opportunity and maneuvered his way through a jaw-dropping 51-yard touchdown for the Arkansas Razorbacks.

Aussies are known for their unconventional behaviour,and Irwin-Hill was no exception in this trick play punt fake. 

Born and raised in Bendigo, 23-year-old Irwin-Hill maneuvered his way through the 51-yard touchdown using a trick play punt fake.

Opening up a clear path, the block formed a flank for Number 92 Irwin-Hill to run all the way to the end zone, scoring the jaw-dropping touchdown for the Arkansas Razorbacks.

Texas A&M graduate Johnny Manziel was spotted wincing and biting his hand on the sidelines of the field, as surprised by the trick play as many of the spectators. 

The nationally televised match was watched by thousands across the United States, with Irwin-Hill drawing praise from commentators and fans alike.

Last year, Irwin-Hill, or number 92, averaged 44.3 yards for punting, and recorded an astonishing 79 yard punt during the season.

The former Catholic College Bendigo student joined the Razorbacks in 2013 on a scholarship, after spending the two previous years in a junior college competition with the City College of San Francisco Rams.

Irwin-Hill's mother Susan said that he called her as soon as he arrived back from Texas, and was overwhelmed by the reaction he had received for the move.

'He said his phone had been ringing hot and he had to do interviews after the game. He was so excited,' Susan told Fairfax.

'Everyone in the US doesn't expect punters to run the football like Sam did.'

'His Aussie Rules background certainly helped him with the way he took on the tacklers.'

'We are so thrilled for him... after all the hard work he's put in, he deserves everything he gets.'
