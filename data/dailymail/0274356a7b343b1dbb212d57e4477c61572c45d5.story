Taking a stand: Jennifer Lahl (pictured), a former pediatric critical care nurse, has made it her mission to get surrogacy federally outlawed

A woman has made it her mission to get surrogacy - the carrying of a pregnancy by a third party for intended parents - federally outlawed in the U.S.

Jennifer Lahl, who has 25 years' experience as a pediatric critical care nurse, told ABC News that separating a child from its birth mother is morally reprehensible because it creates a 'primal wound'.

'It always 
strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions,' said the 56-year-old, who has written in the past about why surrogacy and IVF are not Christian concepts.

'It's all about adults - who wants, who needs, who 
buys and what I can get.'

In her new 
documentary, Breeders: A Sub-Class of Women, she cites several examples 
of surrogacy gone wrong, arguing that these are proof that the practice 
has flaws and that its legality should be reevaluated.

One
 example used by Ms Lahl, who has three college-age daughters of her 
own, is a woman from Minnesota who carried a child for a same-sex couple
 and then fought for visitation rights when the baby was born.

In the 
film, the woman reveals that when the girl was older, she asked her: 
'Why did you give me away, when we look alike, but you kept the other 
children?'

Another woman says in a trailer for the documentary: 'It's not just her uterus that she's renting, it's her entire body.'Â 

Ms Lahl, who is president of the Center for Bioethics and Culture in San Francisco, also asserts that the practice of surrogacy unfairly benefits the wealthy who can afford it, while exploiting those of lesser means.

Indeed, the entire process including in vitro fertilization, donor eggs, legal fees and compensation for the surrogate can cost upwards of $100,000, according to Barbara Collura, the executive director of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.

'It's obviously expensive technology and people with financial means want what they want,' said Ms Lahl.

Of course, 
not all surrogacy experiences have had negative outcomes. Jacey Spratt, 
38, said having twins via a gestational surrogate, her college roommate,
 was 'the culmination of technology and love.'

After a 
strep infection made her unable to carry children on her own, a doctor 
told Ms Spratt that surrogacy was her best bet, even though it cost a 
total of $40,000.

Criticism: Ms Lahl claims that surrogacy does not take into consideration the moral implications for the child, and that it unfairly benefits the wealthy while exploiting the poor

But for parents desperate to have a child, the process is undoubtedly worth every penny.

'Everyone along the journey was great,' said the proud mom. 'You need to see a picture of my daughters to see the happiness that this has brought to our lives.'

Still, the monetary factor does remain an ethical debate, with different states enforcing different rules.

In California, contracted surrogacy is 
allowed for domestic partnerships. Tennessee, on the other hand, where 
same-sex marriage is banned, only allows married couples to have 
surrogacy agreements.

'It always strikes me that the children are so absent in the discussions, it's all about adults'

In Nebraska and Maryland, surrogacy is legal, so long as the surrogate is not paid. And legislation in New York also bans surrogacy compensation.

But according to Ms Collura, banning surrogacy is a backwards step for society. 'Medical advances now allow people to see who were blind; people to walk who lost legs; and people to live lives that a few years ago no one thought was possible,' she said.

'We have the medical technology to allow people to become parents, and why should we simply ban it?'

Ms Lahl has also voiced her criticism of other assisted reproductive technologies including egg donation, sperm donation and IVF.

'Christians still need to look more carefully at today's reproductive technologies such as IVF in light of our beliefs about God, life, our bodies, and our children,' she wrote in a 2013 Christianity Today piece.
