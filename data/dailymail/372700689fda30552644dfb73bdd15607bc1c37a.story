Fugitive Rodney Clavell was found dead after going on the run from police for 14 days

Fugitive Rodney Clavell has been found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD.

South Australian Police Minister Tony Piccolo told state parliament that police discovered Clavell's body following a 12-hour siege.

Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said police located Mr Clavell deceased at about 1.40pm, after deploying a robot to search the premises at about 12.55pm.

'That robot took some time to search the premises but was able to locate Mr Clavell in a position which we believed he was deceased,' he said.

Police located a firearm near Clavell on the first story of the building.

The matter has been determined to be a death in custody and an investigation and file will now be prepared for the coroner.

Clavell had been on the run from police for two weeks in relation to firearms offences. In that time police believe he committed multiple other serious offences.

'On the 25th of May we believe he was involved in an incident in Elizabeth Park where a female was assaulted by Mr Clavell and Mr Clavell had a shotgun,' Mr Dickson said.

Earlier on Thursday four women were released from the building where the 46-year-old was involved in a standoff with police for more than 12 hours.

The women walked out of the building on King William Street in Adelaide at around 11.30am with their arms in the air, and were whisked away by STAR Group police.

Mr Dickson could not confirm if Clavell had been at the premises since Monday, as was reported by some media outlets, or if he was holding the four women hostage.

He said police had never spoken directly to Clavell throughout the negotiations, with all communication coming through a third party.

'I believe he probably had some belief that he was relatively safe at those premises,' he said.

'As to whether he was controlling them or it was more of a free will perspective, there's no doubt they had a harrowing experience.

'Whether he made the conscious decision [to release them] or they just decided to get out, it's hard to know.'

Mr Dickson said he believed some of the women worked at the premises but was unsure whether all of them did.

He said further details of the siege will come after police speak at length with the women, who are all cooperating.

Superintendent Peter Harvey said the four women appeared to be uninjured and they had been taken away from the scene to be interviewed by detectives.

The last woman to come out was visibly more upset than the other three, he said.

'Our information is and all indications are she's not hurt, but very, very emotional as you'd understand,' Supt Harvey said whole the siege was still underway.

'So we've got to try and calm the ladies down, talk to them and then see where we can go because they’re our best source of what's happening inside.'

A close friend of Clavell said he had vowed to kill police if confronted.

The friend said she dropped Clavell at escort agency Marilyn's Studio in Adelaide's CBD on Monday and said he was armed with a .22 rifle.

'He thinks [police] have it in for him, he will take police out,' she told The Advertiser.

'He knows he won't survive this alive today.'

On Thursday morning police surrounded the building where Clavell was armed with a rifle and a cache of ammunition.

The area was locked down by police, which caused major traffic disruptions. Police cordons have since come down and traffic is flowing again.

In 2004 Clavell was involved in a shootout with police after he led them on a 46km chase, at one point driving behind the wheel of a 12-tonne bulldozer.

Earlier on Thursday, Supt Harvey said 'innocent people' were inside the building with Clavell and were unable to leave.

'The people that are with you don't deserve to still be inside,' he said in a direct appeal to Clavell.

Supt Harvey said police believe he was armed.

'He has access to, and is likely to have on him now, firearms,' he said.

Supt Harvey added that police had been trying to make contact with Clavell since 1am this morning.

'He is not answering a phone that we ring and we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to Rodney to please answer the phone.'

He had wanted Clavell to surrender peacefully to police.

Supt Harvey acknowledged Clavell’s violent past but said he had served his time for that.

'It's nothing to do with today except to remind us of his propensity for violence,' Supt Harvey said.

'We have been aware for 14 days that he is armed, so we treat him at the highest level of risk. What you see today is unprecedented for Adelaide.'

King William Street was closed to all members of the public including all public transport between the block of Halifax Street, Sturt Street, Angas Street, Gouger Street and Wright Street.

Clavell had evaded police since a warrant was issued for his arrest over breaching a firearms Prohibition Order on May 20.

Police conducted more than 80 raids, seven of which were high risk.

On May 22 police searched a house at suburban Edwardstown where Clavell was believed to be hiding, after two Adelaide schools earlier were placed in lockdown as a precaution as heavily-armed police searched a nearby area.

Police believe Clavell was a passenger in a rented blue Ford sedan which failed to stop for police on Osmond Street in the inner-city.

Both the passenger and driver ran off and the nearby schools were locked down.

Police raided two houses on May 21 in suburban Skye, but failed to find him.

On May 23, Supt Harvey said police suspected Clavell had access to firearms and considered him as a danger to the community, warning he should not be approached.

'Our taskforce is totally committed to this pursuit,' he said.

'We are aware that certain people are assisting Mr Clavell, the penalties for this is very severe and is up to seven years imprisonment.'

Clavell had a history of drug use and a long criminal history.

In 2004 was the subject of an extraordinary police chase through the Adelaide Hills during which he commandeered a 12-tonne grader from a farm shed.

With a shotgun pointed at his own heart, Clavell led police on a slow-speed chase during which he was shot in the thigh by an officer who he had attempted to run down.

A police sniper eventually stopped Clavell after shooting him in the shoulder.

He was shot twice and tasered by STAR Group officers after the 46km chase through the Adelaide Hills, part of which happened on the 12-tonne bulldozer.

Clavell was initially charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of shooting at a person with intent to resist lawful apprehension but the charges were later dropped.

He was sentenced to four years and four months in jail over offenses relating to theft, driving in a dangerous manner and carrying a loaded firearm.
