Head coach Alan Irvine has warned West Brom that Southampton's summer fire sale has not torched the Saints' threat.

Southampton side have sold around £100million worth of players - including Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren to Liverpool, Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Calum Chambers to Arsenal - during the close season.

They host the Baggies in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday after losing their opening game under Ronald Koeman, going down 2-1 at Liverpool.

Positive start: £10.9m signing Dusan Tadic looked impressive on debut at Liverpool last weekend

But Irvine has told his side the Saints, who have spent £10.9million on Dusan Tadic from FC Twente and £8million on Graziano Pelle from Feyenoord, are still dangerous.

'Having been at Anfield last Sunday and watched how well they played and watched how many chances they were able to create at a really difficult place I think they can more than survive,' he said.

'I think they could have a very good season. They have spent the money very wisely and replaced very good players with very good players.

'I was very impressed with how they played at Anfield. Not many teams go to Anfield and make it go quiet but that certainly happened during periods of the game.

'They deserved something out of the game last week and I believe it will be a very tough place for teams to go this season.'

Danger man: Graziano Pelle was signed for £8m from Feyenoord 

Koeman has replaced Lambert with former Baggie Shane Long in a £12million deal from Hull.

The Republic of Ireland striker only joined Hull from Albion in January, scoring four goals in 15 games, and Irvine is aware of his threat.

He said: 'He's a very good player for a start and is going to be an important player for them, sometimes former players come back to haunt you.

'We have just got to make sure if Shane does play from the start that we are ready to cope with the threat.'

James Morrison and Joleon Lescott have resumed training but are not fit after knee injuries while new signing Georgios Samaras is not in the squad after signing on Friday.

Irvine added: 'The good news is when we started training on Thursday, every player in the squad was there. That included Joleon, though he only did the first part of the session which is what was planned for him and then went and joined the fitness coach.'
