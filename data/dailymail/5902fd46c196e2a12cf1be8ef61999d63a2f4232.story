Only once he was away from the carnival of Rio de Janeiro did Manuel Neuer quite realise the magnitude of what he achieved this summer.

Of course, any footballer would recognise that climbing the steps of the Maracana Stadium to lift the World Cup was the landmark moment in their professional lives.

The subsequent public acclamation in Berlin at The Brandenburg Gate — where the victorious Germany team were greeted by more than a million fans — certainly enforced the point.

Yet it was only when Neuer went on holiday that the size of the triumph became truly clear.

‘I didn’t know how long we would be in the World Cup, so I hadn’t booked any time away beforehand,’ said the Bayern Munich goalkeeper. ‘Then I decided to go away in Europe, a last-minute holiday

‘Never before has there been such hype when I was on holiday. I was just so surprised about what happened. Wherever I went, there were hordes of Germans. Everyone was on a high and celebrating. On holiday, everybody was asking for a photo. I loved doing it but there was not much privacy.’

Neuer is the man Manchester City must get past on Wednesday, a formidable last line of defence for Bayern and Germany.

His career had already been somewhat spectacular: he won the treble of German league and cup and Champions League in 2013 and then the World Club Cup the same year; he won the league and cup double with Bayern in 2014. But the 1-0 win over Argentina is clearly the culmination of the 28-year-old’s achievements in the game.

‘As I went up the stairs in Rio to get the World Cup, my thought was, “How easy it is to climb up these stairs when you have won.” After we had lost to Chelsea (in the 2012 Champions League final) it was more like a horror story. Your legs feel heavy as lead, so does your head. It’s no fun to go up then.’

The summer not only confirmed him as the world’s greatest goalkeeper — a worthy heir to Germany’s Sepp Maier and Oliver Kahn — but also as the pioneer of a new style. The ‘sweeper-keeper’ phrase has been around for a while but it took Neuer in the World Cup to demonstrate just what it can mean.

In the 2-1 win against Algeria, when Germany were forcing the pace of the game, Neuer covered six kilometres, effectively operating as an extra member of the defence ‘I had games like that before,’ said Neuer. ‘But as far as the World Cup is concerned, it attracts more attention. People might get the impression that it was something new but a keeper remains a keeper even when he operates further up field. A keeper has to adjust his game to the team. If the team moves further up, he has to do the same. It’s nothing I’ve invented.

‘It is something that comes naturally. Everybody knows I like it and I can somehow deliver that style. But, again, it all happens because the coach wants to play a certain way and it is better for the team.

‘I have always been interested in finding new ways to play and have looked at handball keepers and ice hockey goal-minders. It helps me.’

There was of course a darker moment in the World Cup final: that charge from goal and the high-knee challenge to the face of Gonzalo Higuain. A stronger referee would have sent Neuer off and awarded a penalty, at which point the story of the summer might have had an entirely differnet conclusion.

Neuer is unrepentant. ‘My opinion is still the same as it was after the game: it was no foul and no penalty. I got to the ball and he didn’t touch it at all. It was not intentional. I apologised right away. I was aware of the fact that it was a tight situation as I had to take a big risk. I had to take a decision in a split second. As a keeper you can’t be afraid. Of course I was aware afterwards that it was painful for him. I clearly went for the ball.’

His predecessor in the German goal, Kahn, has described Neuer’s style as ‘harikiri’ but Neuer is phlegmatic. ‘It can be risky, he is right as far as that is concerned. But it’s not about the keeper being a one-man show. The risk I take is one I take for the team. In the end, I’m the one to blame if it does not work. ’

His inspirations have a strong Premier League flavour and he names former Arsenal and Manchester United keepers as key influences. ‘It is something I often saw from Jens Lehmann, who won the UEFA Cup in 1997 with my former club Schalke. Internationally, I saw it from the Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar.’

For now, there is no time for reflecting. Neuer has Wednesday's game against City and a Champions League campaign on which to focus.

There is a sense that this Bayern team might emulate the Barcelona side which made up the core of Spain’s team from 2008-2012.

Club and country dominated football and Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller perhaps have the capability to do the same.

‘The Bundesliga and the cup are the basics,’ said Neuer. ‘But this season we have the chance to play two finals in Berlin. Everybody wants that. It’s a great thing to play a final in your capital city.’

He is referring to the 2015 Champions League final and the German FA Cup final. It feels as though this is Bayern Munich’s time once more.
