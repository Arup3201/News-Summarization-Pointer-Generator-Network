Under fire: The BBC's new economics correspondent Duncan Weldon has admitted he has flirted with the far Right

His impartiality has already been questioned because of his Left-wing politics and links to the trade union movement.

Now the BBC’s new economics correspondent – also under fire for a relative lack of journalistic experience – has admitted he has flirted with the far Right.

Duncan Weldon, who starts work with flagship current affairs show Newsnight next month, has been accused of taking part in a racist leafleting campaign organised by the British National Party.

After being confronted over the allegations, he wrote a blog post admitting he had a ‘misguided  flirtation with the ideas of the far Right’ as a teenager.

However an article Mr Weldon wrote for his student newspaper in Oxford has also emerged in which he admitted having been a fascist and argued it was ‘possible to hold extreme Right-wing views… without being a racist or homophobe’.

In his blog on Saturday, he denied having joined any Right-wing political party or attending any meetings but admitted: ‘This chapter of my teenage life was witless and intensely embarrassing and I compounded the idiocy with a boastful and ill-judged piece of student journalism a few years later.’

He said his teenage rebellion  was ‘pretty tame’ and consisted  mainly of reading about British fascist Oswald Mosley.

Mr Weldon now faces calls to quit his new post after he was accused of taking part in a banned BNP campaign in 2000, suggesting he may have downplayed his links to the Right.

A report in the Mail on Sunday revealed he helped distribute scaremongering leaflets suggesting that a London council wanted to rehome 16,000 asylum seekers in Newcastle and saying this would lead to riots and ‘whites living in fear’.

BNP leader Nick Griffin was later forced to apologise for the campaign, organised by self-confessed racist Kevin Scott.

In another student article, written under the false name Sam Healey, Mr Weldon reportedly admitted taking part in a number of BNP events and handing out ‘decidedly racist’ leaflets.

He also said he attended a demonstration of around 200 members at which protesters clashed with the police.

In the article he added: ‘I don’t know if my parents ever suspected, but most of my friends at home knew. They were incredibly relieved when I stopped attending meetings.’

The revelations come after Mr Weldon’s BBC appointment was questioned because of his Left-wing views and relative lack of journalistic experience.

A former adviser to Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and economist at the Trades Union Congress, he has written hundreds of Left-wing blogs attacking Conservative policy.

Mr Weldon said he was ‘confident’ he would be able to leave his political views aside once he starts at the BBC.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Mr Weldon is a highly respected professional who has assured us he has not been a member of  the BNP.’

Mr Weldon claimed that he joined the Labour Party after he became disillusioned by far-Right politics.

He said his student article, published in the Cherwell newspaper, embellished his ‘far Right adventure’ because he was keen to impress his fellow peers.

Writing in his blog this weekend, he added: ‘Among the many lines in it that now make me wince with embarrassment was the opening one: “Like a lot of bad things this started with the Tory party”.

‘I suspect I may be reminded of that line a few times in the coming months.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has already written to the BBC questioning Mr Weldon’s suitability for the role, said: ‘Given the revelations about his secret BNP past, it is clear Mr Weldon is unsuitable for a position in our national broadcaster.'
