The great leader certainly left his mark on this vehicle, which was specially modified with a heated footwell, an extra-wide passenger seat and a wooden box believed to be for his bricklaying tools.

Now the 1954 Series 1 Land Rover which was custom built for Sir Winston Churchill's 80th birthday has sold at auction in Sutton, Cambridgeshire, for £129,000 - more than twice its estimate.

The model - which was first registered as UKE 80 in the name of the ‘Rt Hon Sir Winston Spencer Churchill KG. OM. CH. MP. Chartwell, Westerham, Kent’ - has less than 13,000 miles on the clock.

Present: The 1954 Series 1 Land Rover was custom built for Sir Winston Churchill's 80th birthday

Working fine: The Land Rover is in good condition today and has less than 13,000 miles on the clock

It was modified so the former British 
prime minister could be chauffeur-driven around his sprawling 300-acre 
Chartwell estate, and was sold with the original logbook 
registering it to him.

The vehicle, which had been expected 
to fetch only £60,000 at the Cheffins auction, was sold for just £160 by 
Churchill’s relatives more than five years after his death in 1965 aged 90.

It had been presented to Churchill as 
an 80th birthday present in 1954 by Rover, and was registered ‘UKE 80’ 
just three days later, with the 'UKE' thought to refer to the 'United 
Kingdom Empire'.

The manufacturers also added a padded 
fold-down arm rest in place of the eight-inch wide middle seat, and a 
leather-clad grab handle was fitted to the bulkhead.

Provenance: The logbook shows the name and address of Sir Winston Churchill in Chartwell, Kent

Inside: The Land Rover was fitted with an extra-wide passenger seat to accommodate the prime minister

Churchill retired from politics in 
1955 and it was later passed onto his son-in-law, the politician Christopher Soames, before it was sold off in a farm sale in 
the early 1970s for £160.

The vehicle was bought by a Norman 
Mills, who asked his friend Frank Quay to help transport it.

But when Mr
 Quay found Churchill’s name in the logbook, he immediately bought it 
for double the price.

However it was used to tow the 
Quay family’s horse box before they put it away for storage - aware of 
its fascinating history - and it had been kept in a shed in Kent since
 1977.

Mr Quay believed Churchill used the 
wooden box, fitted into the pick-up bed, for storing a trowel 
and mortar so he could indulge in his hobby for bricklaying whenever it 
suited him.

Churchill became prime minister during
 World War Two in May 1940 and helped inspire the nation to victory, 
before losing power in 1945. He was prime minister for a second time from 1951 to 1955.
