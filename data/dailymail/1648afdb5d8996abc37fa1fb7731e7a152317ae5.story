The body of a man found washed ashore in San Francisco last month has been identified as that of a Brazilian man who has been missing since October.

Paolo Netto, 22, made several frantic phone calls on the evening of October 28, saying there were people following him.

A badly decomposed body washed up at McCovey Cove on November 9. Police identified it as that of Netto on Friday.

Deceased: Paolo Netto, a Brazilian art student disappeared in October

Followed: Netto's family distributed missing person posters in their search for the student after he called saying he was being followed

Netto was an art student living in Los Angeles. He had made the trip to San Francisco to look at art schools in the city.

He arrived in San Francisco on Friday 25 October. He checked into the Adelaide hostel, planning to stay the weekend in the city.

He spoke to his family on the Saturday night, telling them he would be taking a Greyhound bus back to LA on Sunday.

But he never caught the bus he was booked on.

CBS reports that Netto called his sister Ana Reis in Brazil on the night of Monday 28 October.

'He said, "Ana, Iâ€™m in trouble. There are some people following me and I need help. Call the police. Call a taxi. Send someone to find me,"' she said.

'He sounded terrified, afraid, frightened.'

Desperate search: His sister Ana last spoke to him on the night he went missing, when he called to say he was being followed

Last location: Netto was near 505 Shotwell Street when he made the frantic call to his sister

She called the San Francisco police from Brazil but when officers arrived on the 500 block of Shotwell St where Netto had been, there was no one there.

According to KTVU, Netto also called his Los Angeles friend and classmate Kevin Viriato.

'It was like, "Kevin, please please help me, please help me, please help me,"' recalled Viriato to KTVU. He urged Netto to call authorities. 'I told him, "If you're in trouble, call the police, they're the best people to help you." He's like "Oh, oh, oh," then he hung up.'

Reis says San Francisco police told her that Netto also called emergency services, but they have not released the 911 recording.

Shortly after his disappearance, an unidentified man used Netto's credit card at a McDonald's at 16th St and Mission. Police have released security footage of the man and are asking anyone with knowledge of his identity to contact them.

Suspicious: Police have released this image of a man who was caught on camera using Netto's credit card days after his disappearance

Identified: Police confirmed Friday that a body washed ashore in San Francisco in November was Netto's

Following his disappearance, Netto's family flew to San Francisco from their home in Rio Verde to look for him, putting up posters in the Tenderloin and Mission neighborhoods.

A corpse washed ashore in McCovey Cove on November 9, but police were unable to identify the badly decomposed body.

The San Francisco Medical Examiner said Friday that following the results of the autopsy, the body has been identified as that of Netto.

Authorities have not yet disclosed how Netto died.

'The medical examiner has to determine whether or not they believe that there was foul play,' Officer Albie Esparza with the San Francisco Police Department told CBS.

'If they do find the cause of death to be suspicious or foul in nature, then it will change our investigation into a homicide investigation.'
