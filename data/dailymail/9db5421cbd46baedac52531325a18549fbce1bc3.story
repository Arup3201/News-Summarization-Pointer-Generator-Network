Yaya Toure will not receive a new contract from Manchester City but manager Manuel Pellegrini insists that the midfielder is content with life at the Etihad Stadium.

The club’s summer was pockmarked by some rather peculiar behaviour by Toure and his agent Dimitri Seluk, in which the pair bizarrely claimed that City did not treat the player with sufficient respect on his birthday.

‘Really, I spoke with Yaya and he’s very happy,’ Pellegrini said, ‘I don’t know what happened in the summer. I hope Yaya can repeat the season he had last season.’

No new deal: Sportsmail understands that Yaya Toure will not receive a new contract from Manchester City

Hopeful: Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini is keen for Toure to repeat last season's feat during this campaign

A host of City stars have this summer signed long-term deals with the club, with Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Sergio Aguero this week joining Samir Nasri in agreeing new contracts.

When asked if further announcements could be expected soon - with Toure’s name in particular mentioned - Pellegrini smiled: ‘We will see in the next days.’

Sportsmail understands that Toure is not one of those in line for a renewed deal but Edin Dzeko is set to put pen to paper soon. City are also keen to retain Joe Hart and James Milner. Hart’s existing deal has two years to run while Milner - who has been monitored by Arsenal and Liverpool - will see his deal run out at the end of this season. The England midfielder will wait to see how many opportunities he is given in the first-team before agreeing an extension.

Toure, however, is only 14 months into a four-year deal that is believed to be worth in excess of £200,000 a week and City see no reason to enter into dialogue with the 31-year-old over a new contract.

Meanwhile, Manchester City will begin their title defence at Newcastle on Sunday afternoon and they are likely to be without £32 million signing Eliaquim Mangala. The French central defender completed his move to City on Monday but Pellegrini feels that he requires further work on the training ground before he can be considered for selection.

Joe Hart is expected return ahead of new recruit Willy Caballero in goal but Pellegrini is yet to make a decision on Sergio Aguero, who has suffered a number of muscle injuries in the last 12 months and City are keen to ease him in after his World Cup exertions this summer.

‘I think that always this team needs Sergio Aguero,’ Pellegrini added,’It is also important for him to make a good pre-season. He has had so many months without playing normally. We will see on Sunday.’

Touch and go: Pellegrini is yet to make a decision on whether to start Sergio Aguero against Newcastle
