There are only 15 minutes of daylight left when we arrive at our lodge deep in the heart of Brazil's Pantanal. 

'Are you ready for a little walk?' asks our handsome young guide, Diogo. A few squirts of insect repellent later, and we're heading down a reddish dirt track - and suddenly it's like a fly-past and a fashion show and a circus performance all at once.

But there is nothing contrived about any of it.

Wet and wonderful: The Pantanal region is a version of Brazil far removed from the beaches of Rio

Diogo points out two hyacinth macaws canoodling in a palm tree, their astonishing blue feathers occasionally wafting in the softest of breezes.

Two burrowing owls stand to attention on the ground near their nest. A great brown hawk glides above us, and a dozen or so chirping parakeets whizz over our heads.

A motley crew of wild pigs scamper about, and near the lake we can see several capybara, the world's biggest rodent, emerging from the lagoon.

Click, click, job done.

But this is only the amuse-bouche of a feast of birds, animals, fauna and flora, sunsets, lakes and much-needed education that awaits us in this unique marshy wetland, the world's biggest floodplain (greater than the size of Britain), where you'll find the largest macaws, the tallest storks, the biggest collection of caimans and gagarin and some species of birds and creepy crawlies that look like they've been dreamed up by boffins on psychedelic drugs.

Now you see me, now you don't: The jaguar is one of the Pantanal's most exciting and elusive residents

The Pantanal is pretty much in the centre of South America.

We are staying on a farm belonging to Roberto Klabin, a paper baron from Sao Paulo. It is about a four-hour drive from Campo Grande.

You take a straight road out of town, and after some three hours you are on a track.

For the last hour, we see only one other vehicle before arriving in the Caiman Ecological Refuge. There are 53,000 hectares and 35,000 Brahma cattle on Klabin's land.

And, by the sounds of it, this is a labour of love.

A place of mists and fruitfulness: The Pantanal is at its most beautiful when the morning fog rises

Climate change sceptics might scoff, but I can sense the anxiety in Diogo's demeanour when he tells us how the four defining seasons in the Pantanal are nothing like as defined as they once were.

We are here in March, but the rains have not yet arrived and this could be catastrophic if it becomes a trend. The flooding is essential.

In a single day, the Pantanal can get 178 billion litres of rain water - which is equal to the volume of all bottled water sold every day worldwide.

Two big projects are ongoing in this remarkable wilderness.

Waiting for the rains to fall: Miniature lagoons appear in the surface of the Pantanal during the dry season

One is all about saving the macaws - and the results are spectacular.

Twenty years ago there were only 1,500 of these wonderful birds in the whole of the Pantanal, today there are 6,000. But there's not much margin for error.

The macaws nest in only one kind of tree and eat only one kind of nut. As chicks they have many predators, and they produce only one chick per year.

They are partners for life, often together for more than 35 years.

The other main project is to do with the jaguar. Diogo and his colleagues speak about these beautiful animals with such reverence that we long to see one but, alas, we are unlucky - the best time to see them is during the dry season from June to October, during the Brazilian winter.

Saddle up: Cattle rearing is an important and visible profession in this most spectacular of regions

Our room is simple, with a small balcony where a hammock has pride of place looking out across the lagoon.

One evening, as dusk falls, we go on a canoe safari, after being seen off by a giant motionless caiman with his jaws locked open. I am convinced he's made of plastic and is put there whenever there are visitors. But then I get within a couple of yards and he swishes his tail, raises his head and disappears into the water.

After 24 hours alone in the lodge we get a rare sighting: two elderly Germans.

We find it hard not to ask what on earth they are doing here but they turn out to be enthusiastic, valuable additions to our team.

Up before the beak: Fabulous feathered creatures - including the toucan - are on show in the Pantanal

They come with us on a night drive when we see giant anteaters (they are almost deaf and blind — the anteaters that is, not the Germans), hoovering up food as if they haven't eaten for days, when we know that pretty much all they do is eat.

'This is the most peaceful place I have ever been,' says my wife one morning.

She's right. This is communing with nature like nowhere else on Earth.
