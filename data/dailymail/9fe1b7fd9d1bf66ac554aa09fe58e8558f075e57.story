A mother died after attempting to save her two sons from a lethal rip-tide as they played at a holiday beach, an inquest heard today.

Tragic Alison Tooby, 53, sprang into action after seeing her two sons, aged 11 and 13, getting into difficulties while body-boarding on September 3 last year.

Classroom assistant Alison ran to help her stranded sons but was fatally caught in a strong current in the waves at Northcott Mouth in Bude, Cornwall.

Tributes: Honeysuckle Parker-Crum, 8, Tilley, 9, and Archie, 6, lay flowers at Northcott Mouth beach where Alison Tooby died

Members of the public, aided by RNLI Bude inshore lifeboat, rushed to help and rescued one boy while the other got back to shore by himself.

Alison, of Taunton, Somerset, was found face down in the water and after resuscitation attempts failed she was airlifted to hospital and later pronounced dead.

An inquest in Bideford, Devon, heard how the summer lifeguard cover has previously ended a day before the tragedy.

In a statement, witness Rosalind Arthur, said: 'I saw a head bobbing in the waves, sometimes you could see it then the waves would obscure my view.

'I heard a scream from the woman shouting as if her life depended on it. She screamed "help me".

'I could not see her in distress but realised something terrible was happening in the sea, as this happened I saw her bobbing around 100 metres off shore.

'I then became aware of a young boy standing on the beach.'

Martin Fry, lifeguard supervisor for the RNLI, attended the scene. He told the court it took him around three minutes to get to the beach in a 4x4 vehicle after he spotted the trio.

He said: 'I saw a man bare chested in the water, I went straight in and could see two people in the water's edge 80 metres from shore clinging to a body board.

'At that stage these were my priority, so I went towards them, as I got closer I saw a lady in a black swimming costume face down in the water.

'My priority then changed to the lady, I paddled to her, pulled her from the water and turned her to face me and checked for vital signs but she was unresponsive.'

Alison's partner, Mike McGuffie told the court: 'This was a tragic accident and I would like to thank everybody who helped.

'Especially the people who went into 
the water to help because having listened to this today it is clear that
they were very brave to do that.'

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death, Coroner Tomalin said: 'Alison's partner has said she knew the 
beach well and was certainly not of knowing her boys would be in danger.

Verdict: A coroner today recorded a verdict of accidental death, but praised the actions of the 53-year-old

'Tragedy is the right word to describe this incident in regards to losing her life but this could have been a lot worse of course as her children were also in danger.

'I am sure, as a parent would, she tried to help her children, in very difficult dangerous conditions.

'That is a reminder to all of us about the beaches in the south west and that we must respect the sea and take care.

'Please do accept my condolences to you, your family, your children and I thank you for coming today, I am sure it has not been easy.'
