These photos show the extraordinary lengths a commuter in Vietnam will go to to avoid making more than one journey.

The astonishing images were captured by photographer Renato Navarro while he travelled along a busy road from the Mekong river to Ho Chi Minh City in the south of the country.

With up to 40 geese bursting out of baskets precariously balanced on his bike, the motorist looks impeccably calm and balanced considering his restless load.

Sights like these are commonplace in Vietnam where the vast majority of people ride mopeds and motorbikes

Mr Navarro, 37, from Sao Paulo, Brazil, said when he saw the rider he could not resist taking a picture.

He said: 'The traffic was horrible. We were going around 6mph or less.

'I was stuck in the traffic for more than three hours but when I saw the funny geese I thought it was worth the waste of time in that packed road. 

'The noise in Vietnam is huge from motorbikes and cars, so if they made noise I believe not even they would hear it.

'I wouldn't dare to drive a motorbike in Vietnam - it is crazy!'

Mr Navarro, who takes pictures around the world, got the shots whilst spending a week in Vietnam on a long photography trip with friends.
