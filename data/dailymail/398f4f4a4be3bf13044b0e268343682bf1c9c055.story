The most desirable version of one of the world’s most iconic cars is to have production relaunched – but only six models will be made.

Jaguar yesterday announced plans to build ‘Lightweight’ E-types after the British firm only ever created 12 despite plans to manufacture 18.

The cars were raced by the likes of Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart and can now command a price tag of over £4million.

Six brand new lightweight E-types are being built by Jaguar, all to the original specification

The brand new six Lightweight E-types will be hand built in-house by Jaguar as ‘perfect reproductions’ and built to the original specification.

The Lightweight was approximately 114kg (250lb) lighter than a standard E-type, due to its all-aluminium body and engine block.

A lack of interior trim and exterior chrome work as well as a host of further weight-saving measures meant it was built for racing. 

Jaguar built around 72,500 E-types, such as the one pictured with the iconic motor regarded as one of the most desirable cars ever built

Between 1961 and 1975, Jaguar built around 72,500 E-types with the iconic motor regarded as one of the most desirable cars ever built.

Of the 12 Lightweight E-types it is thought just 11 exist with the cars seriously sought after by very wealthy collectors.

There is expected to be high demand for the six recreations, with the first one unveiled later this summer.

At the moment there is no official price, but it is likely to be less than the £4-5 million which an original commands.

Graham Searle, from the Jaguar Enthusiasts' Club, said plans to build six more Lightweight models were ‘very exciting’ and ‘unique’.

He added: ‘The Lightweight E-type is a stunning motorcar and one of the greatest sports cars of its day.

‘I think this is quite unique, re-manufacturing a car from 50 years ago. It is great that it will be skilled work as well.

‘They will be hugely expensive but there will be no shortage of interest from buyers.

‘There will be a lot of excitement about this and it shows the confidence at Jaguar since the TATA takeover.’

The E-type Jaguar was built between 1961 and 1975 and often tops the polls of the most desirable sports cars of all time.

The model has a 4.2 litre engine with a top speed of 150mph and could go from 0 to 60 mph in just over seven seconds.

The lightweight E-type has manufactured between 1963 and 1964 and only 12 were ever made.

The car came with 3.8-litre Jaguar engine with 300 brake horse power.
