FACEBOOK has been accused of being a ‘front for gambling’ after it launched a bingo game that allows users to risk thousands to win jackpots in excess of £50,000.

Users of Bingo Friendzy must stake a minimum of £10 on the virtual bingo machine – the site’s first ‘real money’ game – which was launched on the social networking site yesterday.

It will only be available in the UK, where gaming laws are more relaxed than the US, and will be followed by a Las Vegas-style slot machine app created by the same gaming company.

Bingo Frendzy is the first Facebook game where players can gamble with real cash, winning up to £5,000. However, it has come under fire for its cartoon-like logo, which some critic say targets children.

Experts have warned of the dangers of 
social gaming on Facebook, which is used  by almost two out of three 
internet-users in the UK.

And because Bingo Friendzy features 
cartoon characters similar to those on the popular children’s internet 
hit Moshi Monsters, fresh concerns have been raised that youngsters will
be encouraged to play.

Both Facebook and gambling giant 
Gamesys, operators of the Bingo Friendzy app, insist that its controls 
will prevent anyone under the age of 18 – the legal age for gambling in 
the UK – from accessing the real money games. 

A spokesperson for the firms said users must go through strict electoral register and credit card checks before being allowed to play.

The new site plans to offer a range of bingo and slot machine games using real money

But children regularly bypass the 
minimum age limit to have a Facebook profile simply by giving false 
information. At present the website is under growing pressure to 
increase its revenues. The company was valued at £67billion for its 
stock market flotation in May but doubts over its money-making potential
saw £18.2billion vanish from its value in two weeks.

Social gaming and real money gambling are seen as areas where Facebook can deliver rapid increases in revenue.

More ‘real money’ gambling sites are expected to be launched on the site within months.

But Mark Griffiths, professor of 
gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘It is through 
[virtual] gambling that children are introduced to the principles and 
excitement of gambling.’

He visited Bingo Friendzy yesterday 
and said he was struck by the characters which appeared to target young 
people. Professor Griffiths said: ‘I had extreme concerns about the 
graphics and imagery.

‘The whole thing about gambling is 
that it should not appeal to children or adolescents in any way. How 
that squares with the idea of not promoting gambling for children and 
adolescents, I’ve no idea at all.

‘They’re effectively a front for a gambling operator.’

When registering to Bingo Friendzy users can make a ‘quick deposit’ from their debit or credit card of £10 up to £500.

Users are also offered the chance to deposit an amount up to the value of £20,000.

When a Mail reporter registered on the
site with a £10 stake, he was immediately offered the chance of a bingo
jackpot in excess of £5,000 and a slot machine jackpot of over £52,000.

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Real money
gaming is a popular and well-regulated activity in the UK and we are 
allowing a partner to offer their games to adult users on the Facebook 
platform in a safe and controlled manner.’
