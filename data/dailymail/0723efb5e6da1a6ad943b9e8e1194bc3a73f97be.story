Couples are divorcing each other to avoid a property tax imposed by the Chinese government.

The number of married couples splitting up in Beijing has soared as people exploit a loophole in new tax legislation.

In March, China brought in a 20 per cent tax on the profits owners make when they sell their homes.

This means couples that sell their marital home together will be stung by the property tax.Â 

But the law does not apply to divorced couples. This allows married couples with two properties to put one property into each name, divorce and then sell them tax-free.

The couple are then allowed to re-marry.

This gap in the statute is leading to thousands of people splitting up just to avoid the costly bills when selling their home.

Nearly 40,000 couples divorced in the Chinese capital in the first nine months of this year, up 41 per cent on the same period in 2012, the Beijing Youth Daily said, citing official figures.

Warning: A Shanghai marriage registration office, where divorce applications are also processed in China, has put out a sign saying: 'There are risks in the property market, think twice before you get divorced'

The growth rate in divorces was 'far higher' than in the previous four years, the newspaper added.

'The exceptionally fast growth is related to tax evasion by some people taking advantage of a loophole in the (new) property purchase regulations introduced by the government,' Li Ziwei, a marriage expert and former civil affairs official in Beijing, said.

Couples in other cities, where property prices have rocketed in recent years, have also turned to the practice to avoid the capital gains tax, which can amount to tens of thousands of dollars.

Homeowners were previously taxed at just one or two per cent of the sale price.

A Shanghai marriage registration office, where divorce applications are also processed in China, has put out a sign saying: 'There are risks in the property market, think twice before you get divorced'.

Property prices are a sensitive issue in China and authorities have sought for the past three years to control their rise.

As well as the capital gains tax, other measures have included restrictions on purchases of second and third homes, higher minimum down-payments and taxes on multiple and non-locally owned homes in some cities.
