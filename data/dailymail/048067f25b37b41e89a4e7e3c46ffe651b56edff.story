A heroic 12 year old girl has saved the lives of other motorists and her own, after she was forced to take the wheel of her father's car, and steer it clear from ongoing traffic, after he blacked out.

The 51 year old Kotara man, who died after it's believed he went into cardiac arrest, crashed his Mazda MX5 into a tree on Canley avenue at Kotara, in Newcastle at around 8:40pm Wednesday night.

An off-duty police officer, who saw the accident unfold, went to the aid of the girl, before rendering the vehicle safe and commencing CPR on the man.

He was taken to John Hunter hospital but could not be revived and died.

His 12 year old daughter was in the passenger seat when she noticed something was wrong and tried to steer the vehicle to safety after it crossed onto the wrong side of the road.

Police say she was able to steer it away from ongoing traffic, in a 70 kilometre an hour zone, before it mounted a kerb and eventually stopped, striking a tree.

Newcastle police Inspector Gerard Lawson says the young girl was heroic in her actions and avoided another crash and potential fatalities.

'Not every 12 year old could do that, with something happening to her father and still be able to control the vehicle,' he said.

'She has had no formal training and she was able to manipulate the car to avoid other vehicles.'

'Had there been another impact, it scares me to think what could have happened. She saved her life and other motorists.' 

Inspector Lawson said it was remarkable that the young girl was able to avoid other vehicles on the road because she couldn't use the brake or the accelerator.

He confirmed the girl did not have any physical injuries but admitted the incident took its toll.

'She was distressed (after the accident) and her mum came to the scene and they went to the hospital.'

NSW ambulance said it appeared the man may have gone into cardiac arrest prior to hitting the tree but could not determine the cause.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.
