Migrants who want to settle in the UK with a husband or wife will have to wait five years before they can claim benefits, ministers will announce today.

The change - designed to deter sham marriages - more than doubles the  two years which a new spouse currently has to wait before claiming benefits.

New spouses will also face tougher language tests to stay in Britain.

The measures will be launched by 
Immigration Minister Damian Green in an overhaul of rules governing the 
family route into Britain – which accounted for nearly 50,000 arrivals 
last year.

The policy paper will also examine ways to scale back the use
of ‘family life’ rights by criminals.

Mr Green said: ‘For too long the family and marriage route into the UK has been abused as a way to get round our immigration law.’

The first language tests for spouses were introduced earlier this year, and require ‘conversational’ English, but the Home Office wants to make the test more demanding.

It is hoped the changes will encourage migrants to integrate into British society.

The benefits changes are designed to stop abuse of the system.

Last year 48,900 family visas were granted to foreign nationals. Of those around 40,000 were for marriages or civil partners, and the remainder for dependants such as children and other relatives.

In addition, another 21,000 spouses were given the right to stay indefinitely.

In a recent case a sham marriage gang were revealed to be charging £10,695 for every bogus wedding they conducted.

Another case saw a gang jailed for a total of 14 years after marrying multiple partners to allow them to stay in Britain.

In one case, a Pakistani national applied for a spouse visa on the basis of his marriage to someone settled in the UK. After being granted indefinite leave to remain, he divorced and returned to Pakistan where he remarried and then applied for entry clearance for his new partner.

A Bolivian man who also claimed the right to a family life was able to stay in the UK partly because he owned a pet cat.

The proposals will also look to prevent foreign criminals from staying in the UK. Every year hundreds of migrants who have committed crimes in this country use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act to thwart attempts to kick them out.

Criticism mounted over Article 8 after Iraqi immigrant Aso Mohammed Ibrahim used it to stay in the UK despite running over and killing a 12-year-old girl, Amy Houston.

Ibrahim, who was disqualified from driving at the time and had a number of previous convictions, fled the scene, leaving the youngster to ‘die like a dog’ under the wheel of his car.

He was allowed to stay because the judge said he had started a relationship with a woman in Britain and had two children.

A Sri Lankan robber was also allowed to remain in the UK because he had a girlfriend in Britain and judges ruled an Iraqi killer should not be sent back because he would have posed a risk to people in his home country.

In 2010, 233 appeals against deportation were made. Of these, 149 were successful on human rights grounds - 102 of them citing Article Eight alone.

Just 35 were under Article Three, which protects people from being killed or tortured if returned to an unsafe country. The rest used a mix of articles, figures from HM Courts Service showed.

Last week Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted a ‘better definition’ of Article 8 so more foreign criminals can be sent home.

Mr Green added: ‘These cases clearly show why we need to take strong action and the proposals we will outline today will benefit the UK as a whole as well as individuals who would otherwise be exploited.’
