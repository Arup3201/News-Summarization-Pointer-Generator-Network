Reckoning: Dr Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, turned himself in at the Tarrant County Jail and was charged with animal cruelty

A Texas veterinarian accused of secretly keeping a family's 5-year-old Leonberger for six months for blood transfusions has been arrested on animal cruelty charges.

Dr Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, turned himself in at the Tarrant County Jail at around 7pm Wednesday and was later released on $10,000 bail.

His veterinary license also was been suspended by the state pending an investigation. 

According to the suspension order, officials inspecting Tierce's clinic found 'unsanitary conditions, animal organs kept in jars, bugs in exam rooms, open and unsecured medications.'

They also discovered that five pets the veterinarian had accepted for euthanasia were still alive, one of them kept in a cage for two or three years.

Earlier in the day, the veterinarian dismissed the allegations against him as a 'bunch of hooey.' 

The arrest came one day after police in Fort Worth raided Tierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic after being tipped off about possible animal abuse.

Marian 
Harris, of Aledo, says that last October, she gave Tierce permission to 
euthanize her Leonberger named Sid after the doctor told her that the 
pup was suffering from a congenital spinal disorder.

But
 last Monday, Mrs Harris got a call from a former employee at the animal
 clinic telling her that her dog has been kept alive in a cage for the 
past six months.

In
 a scene straight out of the 1992 family classic Beethoven, Marian 
Harris and her husband, Jamie, marched down to the animal clinic and 
discovered Sid imprisoned in a pen in a back room.

‘The betrayal is so incredibly intense 
that nothing you have prepares you for the emotions. There’s anger, 
there’s joy that you have your dog back, there’s betrayal of this 
intense trust. And so it’s just really hard to camp on one particular 
emotion,’ Harris told CBS DFW.

Good Samaritan: Former clinic worker Mary Brewer called the Harris family to tell them that their dog was alive and used for experiments

The mother of two from Aledo said her pet, which was supposedly terminally ill, was able to walk and jump into her minivan on his own when she came to rescue him. 

The family drove the pooch to another clinic, where a veterinarian determined that Sid did not need to be put down at all.

‘It was like getting punched in the stomach and then some,’ Marian Harris told the station NBC DFW. ‘This has rocked our world. My kids are like, “How does somebody do this?” How does this happen?"’

On Tuesday, police officers descended on Camp Bowie clinic in the 5700 block of Lovell Avenue and seized two more dogs as evidence.

Late Wednesday afternoon, Dr Tierce spoke out in his own defense, calling the Harris family's claims as 'a bunch of hooey.'  

Speaking to the Star Telegram, the veteran medic said that it was Mrs Harris who wanted her dog euthanized, but he could not bring himself to do it.

Tierce also said Mary Brewer, who contacted the Harris family about their dog, was just a disgruntled former employee who wanted to get back at him. 

The former Camp Bowie staffer, however, insisted that she quit her job because she could not continue working in a place where animals are mistreated.

Since the story broke Wednesday, clients have been visiting Dr Tierce's clinic to find out what really happened to their pets.

One of the people concerned for the fate of their pets was Rebecca Pierce, a yoga instructor from Fort Worth.

Mrs Pierce filed a complaint yesterday stating that last May, she was told by Dr Tierce that her dog named Maxina has died.

The veterinarian handed her a box allegedly containing the animal’s ashes, but he never billed her for any services, MyFox DFW reported.

Pearce's compliant also says that staff at Camp Bowie clinic told her that there were no records of Maxina's cremation.

For Sid and the Harris family, it all started last May when the family brought their 170-pound pet to the Fort Worth clinic to be treated for a minor anal gland issue, The Star Telegram reported.

Dr Tierce told the Harrises he wanted to treat Sid with a new ‘cold laser’ and warned them that it could take the dog longer to recover, according to the family’s complaint filed April 22 with the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners.

By October, Sid’s condition has deteriorated to the point where he could not lift his hind legs and had to drag his body on the ground.

Around that time, Dr Tierce allegedly informed the owners that their dog had a congenital spinal defect, and the best course of action would be to put him down because there was no cure for his condition. 

The veterinarian even kindly offered to bury the 5-year-old Leonberger on his farm.

The family gave Tierce the green light to euthanize Sid, and even brought their son, Cole, to the clinic to say his final farewell to the four-legged friend.

‘So I brought him [Cole] in and had our tearful goodbyes, and we went over very specifically our plans for burial of Sid, and that was the end of it,’ Marian Harris recalled.

Then on 
April 21, out of the blue Mrs Harris got a call from Mary Brewer, a 
former employee at Camp Bowie, who told the woman that Dr Tierce never 
euthanized Sid, and instead he has kept him around as a plasma donor for
 other pets.

Sad outcome: The three dogs that were removed from the clinic Tuesday, including Tierce's black and white border collie, had to be put down

‘I
 remember coming in and them extracting blood from Sid, and basically 
shaving him, extracting his blood for the other animal upstairs,’ Brewer
 said to MyFox DFW, adding that the dog was kept locked up almost the whole time, denied treatment and he had been injured by another worker.

According
 to the Harrises’ complaint, ’The clinic was using Sid (and other dogs) 
for blood transfusions and other experimental treatments.’

The Harris family's lawyer, James Eggleston, wrote that Dr Tierce also harvested organs of some pets in his care and has kept one dog alive nearly five years for the purpose of using his blood and plasma.

According to the lawyer, at least a dozen former clinic workers and clients have come forward with information on Dr Tierce's misconduct dating back to 1997, the Weatherford Democrat reported.  

The road ahead: Sid returned from his forced six-month stay at the clinic with mange and will undergo rehabilitation

Ms Brewer explained that she did not go to police right away because she has a criminal record, which could have undermined her credibility.

When Marian Harris stormed into the clinic and found Sid living in a cage, covered in his own urine and feces, she confronted Dr Tierce about the deceit.

Liar: James Harris said Dr Lou Tierce (pictured) lied to him when he said that his dog had a congenital spinal defect

‘He said, “I didn't put him down because my staff said they would quit if I did,”’ said Mrs Harris.

The veterinarian who evaluated Sid after his dramatic rescue found that the 5-year-old dog had mange and showed ‘definite signs of having been used for blood transfusions.’

In a brief phone interview with MailOnline Wednesday afternoon, Jamie Harris said that Sid is currently resting at home and is in 'reasonable health.'

According to Sid's owner, the pooch still has rehabilitation ahead of him, but an MRI has confirmed that he never had a congenital spinal defect.

Mary Brewer revealed that there was also a cat that Dr Tierce was supposed to put down because he had abscess in his mouth and could not eat.

‘Dr Tierce changed his name to Graling, had us put him in the dog ward and  left him there, and this time that I came back in in 2013, he's still there,’ said the former clinic staffer.
