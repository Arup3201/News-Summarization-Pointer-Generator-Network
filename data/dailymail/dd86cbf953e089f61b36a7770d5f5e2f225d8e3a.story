A widower has spoken of how he will never come to terms with the horrific murder of his beloved wife and step-daughter at the hands of his Turkish son-in-law.

Ensar Gol, 22, repeatedly stabbed his wife, 
Michala, 28, to death as she lay sleeping in their bed at home in Thame, Oxfordshire,
 in September 2011. He then fatally attacked his mother-in-law, Julie Sahin, 50, when she tried to rush to her daughter's aid.

Both women received dozens of stab wounds to their neck and bodies following Gol's premeditated murderous rampage.

Holiday romance: Michala met Turkish waiter Gol when in Bodrum

Now Julie's husband, Mehmet, has spoken of his shock and grief in the new series of Britain's Darkest Taboos on the Crime + Investigation channel.

He said: 'He took everything. I
 didn't know till then that they were my only reason to live, my only joy in life.  

'Julie was a fantastic mother, and a wife to me. I miss them loads.'

Michala had met Gol, a waiter, while on holiday in the Turkish resort of Bodrum in 2007. Their holiday romance blossomed into a serious relationship and they married and had two children, eventually settling in the UK.

Turkish native Mehmet said he and Julie - whose relationship had also begun as a holiday romance in 2002 - disapproved of the relationship but Michala wouldn't listen and wanted to make the marriage work after she had children.

'We did try to tell her, but Michala being Michalaâ€¦ she didnâ€™t want to hear any of that,' Mehmet said. 'After she's given birth to two kids she sort of felt that a father figure will have to be there.'

Victims: Michala and her mother Julie, left, were stabbed to death by Gol

But, as Mehmet reveals, Gol became increasingly controlling of Michala; physically and verbally abusing her and cheating on her with a local barmaid.

Their relationship reached breaking point in 2011 and Gol decided to return to Turkey - but Michala called him as he travelled to the airport and begged him to come home.

'If Michala hadn't have rung him and made him change his mind, I think they'd still be here today,' says her uncle, Wade Anderson, who also agreed to speak about the tragedy for the TV documentary.

He added that Julie's 'pure hatred' for her son-in-law was no secret. 'She knew he was wrong for Michala, but Michala wouldn't listen. She might listen to what you'd say to her, but wouldn't do anything about it, because she was so committed,' Wade said.

Not long after returning to the family home, Gol started plotting his murderous attack and even boasted about it on Facebook.

Murderer: Michala's family never liked Gol but she stuck by him because of their children

Guilty: The accused smiled for the cameras when he arrived in court to be tried for murder

He messaged a cousin saying: 'This crazy Turk Wolf is going to cover London in blood. I have the knife ready.'

On the night of 3rd September, after drinking heavily and having sex again with the local barmaid, Gol returned home and went into the kitchen to arm himself with a knife.

He then went upstairs where 
Michala was asleep with their daughter in the room and stabbed her repeatedly. 

Julie, who had been watching TV downstairs at the time with family friend Casey, heard muffled screams and rushed to Michala's aid.

Mehmet, who was at work when the attack took place, said: 'All Julie wanted to do was to keep Michala safe. She just wanted to save her. She didn't care that
 she might be dead.'

When Julie and Casey tried to pull Gol off Michala he turned the knife on them. Casey managed to escape but Julie was fatally stabbed more than 50 times.

As the women lay dying, Gol then picked up his four-year-old daughter - who had witnessed the horrific scene - and carried her out into the street with him, the murder weapon still in his hand. He was shouting: 'No one believed me, but I've done it. I've butchered them both.'

Once he was arrested, he denied the murders saying he had acted in self-defence after Julie had attacked him first.

Wade said: 'He never showed one ounce of remorse at all. I don't think he ever will. He said that Julie attacked him first, and he turned on them. Just rubbish.'

Gol was pictured smiling as he arrived at Oxford Crown Court for his trial in May 2012.

A jury of seven men and five women decided that Gol had been guilty of killing Michala and Julie, as well as trying to kill Casey, now 21.

Shocking: The family home in Thame became a crime scene and Michala's young daughter witnessed the attacks

The judge told him he would serve 36 years for each murder and 12 years for the attempted killing to be run concurrently.

Mehmet said he and the rest of the family are satisfied with the sentence but are now struggling to get on with their lives following the brutal murders.

'There's a great big void now, the two children are left without a grandma, a mother, and a father.'
