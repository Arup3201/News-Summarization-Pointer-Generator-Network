Arsene Wenger has revealed he was on the verge of signing Eden Hazard before Chelsea swooped in.

The Arsenal boss said he had Hazard's agent discussing the deal at his home, but London rivals Chelsea's financial power won the battle for his signature from French side Lille.

Hazard won the PFA Young Player of the Year after being nominated for the full award, which Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez won.

Asked about snapping up the Belgian, Wenger told BeIN Sports: 'Yes, I wanted to take him, I had his agent at my home but again the barrier was financial and Chelsea made an effort that I couldn't make.

'He can be one of the players who grows into the Messi, Ronaldo stature if he continues to develop well.'

Wenger has still not signed a new deal at the Emirates with his current contract expiring at the end of the season.

He revealed a he would consider a move to Germany if he was to leave the Gunners in the future.

'If I was to go somewhere then I think it would be in a different country because I am so much Arsenal that I would not like to coach anywhere else in England,' he said.

'Germany (is an option) because I am of German culture a little bit and it's a country where I have never worked and I am very close to it.'
