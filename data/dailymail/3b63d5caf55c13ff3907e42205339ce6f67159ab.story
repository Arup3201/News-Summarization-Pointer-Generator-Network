A former party-boy who became an Islamic State fighter has been reported dead.

Melbourne man Mahmoud Abdullatif, known by friends for his love of women and fast cars, was believed killed in a clash in the past 48 hours.

A woman purporting to be his wife on Twitter marked his death with an apparent celebratory message. 

'Till we reunite in Jannatul Firdaws (heaven) my dearest husband,' the account said. 'You won the race! Heart of a green bird insha'Allah habibi<3!'

It has been reported that Victorian woman Zehra Duman, pictured, had married Abdullatif

Just a month ago, Abdullatif announced his marriage to the woman, reportedly Victorian woman Zehra Duman, on Twitter. 

At the time, he also said he hoped for a 'beautiful death.

'I got married today... insha Allah I receive a beautiful death as well. #jihadlife,' he wrote on December 19. 

Abdullatif was pictured just weeks ago accompanying Sydney militant Mohamed Elomar and a friend.

Abdullatif's purported killing is the latest in a spate of Australian deaths in the Middle East. 

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a mid-level Islamic State commander, was reported dead in October. 

Authorities believed Baryalei responsible for the recruitment of as many as half of the Australians fighting for the Islamic State.
