BLAZING STAR: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE EARL OF ROCHESTER by Alexander Larman (Head of Zeus £25) 

The first law of fiction is that bad characters are more rewarding than good ones. Much the same can be said of history: vice is more interesting than virtue.

The Earl of Rochester, the baddest of bad hats at the wicked court of Charles II, has always had that appeal. Good-looking and highly talented, this dandy poet is remembered for wrecking his own life and dying far too young.

His life was made into a film, The Libertine, starring Johnny Depp, but attempts at his biography have usually failed because the many anecdotes about his behaviour are often of doubtful provenance, as is his literary oeuvre: any smutty verse of the period is automatically credited to him.

Alexander Larman picks his way with care through this minefield and gives us the most comprehensive portrait of Rochester yet.

He also paints a vivid picture of the society of Restoration London, which was wild. The 1660s were in some ways like the 1960s — a time of excess in rejoicing, namely at the ending of the killjoy Cromwellian Commonwealth.

Women behaved with abandon at their liberation, following the example of Charles himself. His mistresses and illegitimate offspring were legion.

Nicknamed ‘Old Rowley’, the king had insatiable appetites for food and sex, which inspired his court, not least Rochester.

Born John Wilmot, he was the son of Charles’s most loyal crony during his escape and exile in France. Henry Wilmot was rewarded by being made Earl of Rochester, whereupon he died before his friend Charles returned home as king.

The baddest of the bad: The Earl of Rochester was one of the most vice-ridden men of Charles II's court

Charles rewarded his son in his stead with a pension of £500 a year (worth £40,000 today). Next he made him a Gentleman of the Bedchamber with another stipend and appointed him Ranger of Woodstock Park with a lodge to live in.

Rochester would have been rich if the emoluments had only been paid regularly. But the Crown was always short of money, so they were not. In addition, Rochester was a spendthrift, so continually hard up.

While a teenager, Rochester had been given an Oxford degree (at the age of 14), done the Grand Tour of Europe for two years, then volunteered for service in the sea wars with Holland. While under fire, he behaved with bravery.

At 18 he came to court, and by the time he was 20 he had married an heiress, Elizabeth Malet, whom he’d attempted to abduct from her coach after becoming infatuated with her. He had been caught and an angry Charles sent him briefly to the Tower; Elizabeth, however, forgave him.

Rochester seems to have loved his wife and their children, but saw little of them at the country house in Oxfordshire they shared with his mother. He was too busy at court.

He was already a heavy drinker — he once claimed he’d been continually drunk for five years.

His drinking companions, including George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and his best friend Henry Savile, called themselves ‘The Merry Gang’ and ‘The Ballers’.

Samuel Pepys once had dinner with them. ‘Lord! What loose, cursed company was this, though full of wit,’ he told his diary. The drunken exploits often ended with the gang doing damage.

The most notable was the night they got into the King’s Privy Garden at Whitehall, where his latest, most expensive timepiece, a chronometer, lay — adorned with glass spheres engraved with royal portraits. Rochester proceeded to smash them to pieces with his sword.

Charles II had 14 illegitimate children

Charles was not amused. He was always banishing Rochester from court, but would send for him again soon afterwards to enjoy his conversation and charm.

The custom of the wits at court was to write scandalous verses that were circulated by hand in manuscript, like an early version of Twitter, though much more literate.

Charles was delighted with Rochester’s couplet about him that ran:

"He never said a foolish thing

Nor ever did a wise one."  

 He was not so pleased when he read Rochester’s Satire on Charles II:

"Restless he rolls about from whore to whore

A merry monarch, scandalous and poor…

His sceptre and his p***k are of a length

And she may sway the one who plays the other."

The result was banishment — yet again.

Some of Rochester’s verses are so explicit and outspoken as to be shocking even today, when almost anything can be printed.

Unusual courtship: Rochester became infatuated with Elizabeth Malet (played by Rosamund Pike) and once attempted to abduct her from her coach

He delighted in exposing the naked lust of all classes, including the most respectable. He listed them in A Ramble In St James’ Park, a place of assignation down the centuries. But there was a dark side to Rochester that often turned sexual congress to ashes.

A Ramble ends by cursing women, as do several other poems, which depict them as game for all-comers.

It would be easy to take him for a misogynist. A likely reason for this is the misfortune bestowed on him by his wholesale whoring — an incurable dose of syphilis, which was to kill him.

‘I’ve swived more whores than Sodom’s walls e’er knew,’ he declares. ‘I’ve out-swilled Bacchus, blasphemed God and libelled Kings . . . the quickest way to hell’s by Rochester.’

It is not boasting but self-disgust that inspired him.

Monkeying about: Rochester once declared that all men are knaves, and he'd rather be a monkey

His satires grew more wholesale until they encompassed everyone — A Satire Against Mankind declares that all men are knaves, but he’d rather be a monkey. It was with a monkey that he chose to be painted.

His disillusion with love was complete when he fell for the actress Elizabeth Barry, a leading lady of the Restoration stage who entertained numerous other lovers. He, of all people, hardly had the moral right to complain of infidelity, but it seems to have enraged him.

By the time she bore him a daughter, the affair was over. He did not even go to see the baby, but two years later he abducted the child to be raised with his other children by his uncomplaining wife.

He took no great part in their upbringing. By that time, he was more often absent from the family home and court through illness.

He must have been well aware that his time was nearly up. He sent for a future bishop, Gilbert Burnet, with whom he had long, sceptical discussions about God.

Rochester could not believe in a heaven or hell, but he did express remorse for his life. As Dr Johnson observed: ‘He blazed out his youth and health in lavish voluptuousness.’

The strange thing is that after his death in delirium at the age of 33, he became more famous than ever because of his deathbed repentance. This was announced in a biography published immediately by Bishop Burnet.

Larman points out that his penitence rests entirely on the testimony of Burnet and Rochester’s mother Anne, who wrote his formal Remonstrance (‘I detest and abhor the whole course of my wicked life’) and much more in the same vein. Rochester had signed this in a shaky hand. But did he mean, or even know, what it said?

His mother then set about destroying any of his work she could lay her hands on. How much we lost we do not know. But what remains of his clever, anguished poems is enough to keep his name and talent evergreen.
