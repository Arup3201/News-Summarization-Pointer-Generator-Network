Vicente del Bosque has received the backing of the Spanish Football Federation, in spite of Spain's disastrous World Cup campaign which has seen the holders exit the tournament after just two games.

The coach is under contract until after the European Championships in 2016 but admitted after Spain's 2-0 defeat to Chile, which followed the humiliating 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Holland, that his future was not certain, saying: 'We need to decide what's best for Spanish football, and that includes myself.'

However, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) insist they want the 63-year-old, who has won the World Cup and European Championships with Spain, to stay in charge of La Roja.

Humbled: Spain were beaten 5-1 by Holland in their opening group match and then lost 2-0 to Chile

'From top to bottom in the Federation we are all behind Del Bosque,' Jorge Perez, Spain's director of football, told radio station Cope.

'If we have the best coach around, why would we change?'

Perez revealed that the Federation preferred not to discuss Del Bosque's future with the coach just yet, and would wait until after Spain's final World Cup game with Australia.

Not good enough: Koke, Javi Martinez and Raul Albiol reflect on the World Cup exit

'We still haven't spoken with Del Bosque, it's better to put a bit of distance between us and wait and then speak calmly in Madrid,' he said.

'When Del Bosque signed the contract he said that if there was any motivation that we thought he shouldn't continue, he would leave. But I want him to stay.

'He wont be affected by the criticism. His family might convince him to leave, but we aren't going to find anyone better. Del Bosque has not resigned. If he does, we will try to convince him to stay.'
