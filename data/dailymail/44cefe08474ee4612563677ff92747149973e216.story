An Australian family which fought tirelessly for nine months to save their pet from death row says the ending is 'bittersweet' after the dog was released from the pound - but forced to relocate more than 1200 kilometres from home.

After a long and expensive battle with authorities, and a groundswell of public support via an incredible social media campaign, Zeus, an American Pit Bull whose breed is considered dangerous in Queensland, was finally freed on Wednesday.

And despite a huge and emotional sigh of relief from his owner Sinaed Cuff, Zeus is unable to spend the rest of his life with the family that loves him, a strict condition of his release.

Lucky to be alive: Zeus the dog was sentenced to death for being a restricted breed in Queensland, Australia, but thanks to a campaign to save him he will instead be relocated to the Australian Capital Territory, some 1200km away from home

Ms Cuff said her dog was captured by the Brisbane City Council after he was found by rangers 'wandering at large' when he escaped their backyard last year.

The family expected to have Zeus returned and to pay a fine. Instead, the council instead issued a destruction order for Zeus - declaring he was part American Pit Bull, a restricted breed in the state of Queensland.

His family had adopted him just seven months prior to his capture, but believed him to be a labrador/Staffordshire terrier cross.

After a long search for a vet willing to independently assess Zeus’ breed, he was named as 'a crossbred entire male dog' who 'appears to have the physical characteristics more of an American Staffordshire Terrier than any other breed'.

The veterinarian’s certificate should have secured the dog’s immediate release but the council stood by their classification of Zeus as a Pit Bull, which was later supported by a Council-engaged assessor.

The matter was then taken to court in January thanks to the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, who found a legal team willing to fight pro bono, but later adjourned to enable the parties to explore the option of re-homing Zeus outside the Brisbane City Council’s jurisdiction.

Stressed out: Zeus was forced to live in Brisbane City Council's pound for nine months while his owners fought a destruction order in the courts

In addition to fighting the death penalty, the family also was required to pay an impoundment bill of nearly $30 per day, which now totals more than $4500.

But thanks to fundraising efforts from Bark Queensland and Sydney-based advocacy group Team Dog, those costs were covered in full.

Team Dog's founding member Melanie Isaacs said she launched a social media campaign called 'Free Zeus' after hearing of the family's fight and the financial dilemma that might have prevented them getting Zeus back.

Within hours of launching the campaign last Friday, Ms Isaacs said donations to help the family had totalled more than $2000 - well more than the $1500 required.

Ms Isaacs said determining a dog's breed could be problematic, if not impossible.

'We don't know for sure if Zeus is a Pit Bull or not, it's impossible to tell the breed of a dog or find out if he has any Pit Bull in him.

'That's the biggest flaw with breed-specific legislation.'

As a puppy, Zeus was a playful and energetic dog and his owners hope he will be just as happy in his new home

The council had told Zeus's owners they would release the pet if they satisfied a range of requirements, which Ms Isaacs said they did, and paid the impoundment costs.

However, Ms Isaacs said officers inexplicably changed their minds that same afternoon, deciding to keep Zeus until the next scheduled court hearing in April.

But after the fees and documentation was provided, the council finally chose to release Zeus on Wednesday - on the condition he be sent to the Australian Capital Territory, more than 1200km away from his home.

Ms Isaacs said relocating Zeus to the ACT was their only viable option, with the territory the only place in Australia where the breed was not deemed illegal.

'It's a bittersweet ending, I guess,' Ms Isaacs said.

'The family is really happy because they thought Zeus was going to be put to sleep, and now he has a really loving home to go to.'

Despite being on death row, Zeus was treated to a lot of cuddles and attention while in the pound

Ms Cuff said saying goodbye was the hardest thing she's ever had to do.

'It's hard to see the silver lining the day after saying my goodbyes with a night full of tears and mixed emotions, but yesterday was a beautiful sight...he was so happy and so curious with all his forgotten surroundings,' she said.

'We all just need to try and keep our minds set on the good things that have come of this instead of his month after month long fear of his end.'

Her partner Cameron and four-year-old daughter were also reeling over Zeus' relocation, devastated he wouldn't be coming back home.

'My daughter knows that he is safe and will be going from his holiday to a new mummy where he will be safe and loved and have a lot of fun, though you can imagine her pain loosing her friend,' she said.

'My partner loved Zeus, and the fact of loosing him from the beginning has seemed unbearable for him to think about.'

But despite the pain, Ms Cuff said it was a happy ending for an animal she thought would be euthanised for doing nothing wrong.

'Luckily with all the support and followers we have we all have achieved something amazing,' she said.

'He is safe, he is free and he will be loved.'
