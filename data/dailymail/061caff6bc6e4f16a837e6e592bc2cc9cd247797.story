Philip Seymour Hoffman's pivotal role in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 will be re-shot using CGI to replicate the Oscar winning actor's final scenes.

It had originally been thought that the death of Hoffman on Sunday from an apparent drugs overdose on Sunday had left a week's worth of shooting unfinished.

However, Filmmakers, Lionsgate have said that despite Hoffman's character, Plutarch Heavensbee holding a major role in the film franchise, his death will have 'no impact' on production and the final two movies will be released on time.

The Hollywood Reporter has claimed that Lionsgate are now going to use CGI effects to create a likeness of Hoffman that will not necessarily be viewed face-on to camera.

'These days the technology of using someoneâ€™s likeness is a whole lot easier to do,' Rob Legato, an effects supervisor on major films including The Wolf of Wall Street, told The Hollywood Reporter. 

'I wonâ€™t say you could generate a Philip Seymour Hoffman with all the acting ability, but you could certainly replicate him for a shot or two.'

Another Lionsgate executive said that Hoffman's death will not affect the much anticipated movies and that the actor provided his usual sterling performances during filming.

'His performances in both remaining movies will be up to the best of his craft,' the executive stated. 'We feel it will be a good tribute to him.'

Replacing actors with digital replicants because the performer had died is not new.

Oliver Reed's final role in Gladitor was fleshed out with CGI after the British star died in a drinking competition on the island of Malta during filming in 2000.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is due to be released on November 21, 2014, while Part 2 is scheduled for a November 20, 2015 release.

On Monday, Jennifer Lawrence and the rest of the cast of the film issued a joint statement of condolences following the tragic death of Phillip Seymour Hoffman on Sunday.

'Words cannot convey the devastating loss we are all feeling right now,' read the tribute.

Philip was a wonderful person and an exceptional talent, and our hearts are breaking. Our deepest condolences go out to his family.'

Following the news of the Oscar winner's sudden death, Lionsgate issued a statement of condolences on Sunday.

'Philip Seymour Hoffman was a singular talent and one of the most gifted actors of our generation. We're very fortunate that he graced our Hunger Games family.'

It was revealed after his death that Hoffman - who spent 10 days in rehab last year after relapsing into heroin use following 23 years of being clean and sober - had separated from his longtime girlfriend Mimi O'Donnell in the months leading up to his death.

After the split from his partner of 14 years, the mother of his three children, son Cooper, 10 and daughters Tallulah, aged seven, and Willa, aged five, the actor began renting a $10,000-a-month apartment in Bethune Street in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.

His body was found on Sunday at the rented home by close friend and playwright David Bar Katz, who had been asked to check up on him by O'Donnell.
