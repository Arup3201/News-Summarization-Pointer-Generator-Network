The family of a Queensland woman who died during her work Christmas party will not receive a payout for her death because she was ruled to be off-duty when the accident happened.

Jukes Campbell was celebrating the function with colleagues when she dove into a shallow section of the Noosa River, suffering neck and back injuries.

Despite the party being sanctioned by her boss and organised by the Woolworths-owned store, her death won't be recognised as a workplace accident.

Jonathon Campbell, the woman's husband, turned her life support off two days after the party.

Jonathon Campbell lost his a bid for his wife's workers compensation after the Queensland IRC ruled she did not die from duties performed at work.

The Courier Mail reported that the Industrial Relations Commission, who sided with a Woolworths bid to block the family's claim for compensation, ruled that her husband Mr Campbell was not entitled to a payout from his wife’s death because she had been 'on a frolic of her own'.

In order to qualify for a workers compensation payout staff must prove their injury 'arose out of, or in the course of' their work.

The IRC ruled that Mrs Campbell was not working, proving a cruel blow for her husband who had originally won a Queensland Government workers compensation claim after the deputy director-general for Fair and Safe Work Queensland approved it.

Woolworths said its staff encouraged Ms Campbell to attend the party which was celebrated in March instead of December because of staff commitments, but denied they encouraged her to dive into the Noosa River.

It is claimed Ms Campbell asked her manager to take photos of her just before the accident occurred.

Woolworths has refused to comment on the matter because Mr Campbell has lodged an appeal and the case is still ongoing.

The maximum amount payable for a workers compensation payout in Queensland is $374,625.

Woolworths is one of Australia's largest retailers employing more than 197,000 people nationwide. It has nearly 900 retail liquor outlets and 627 petrol stations.

In a similar case in NSW, Woolworths refused to pay workers compensation to the three orphaned children of single mother Marie Scanlan, the manager of a petrol station in western Sydney.

Ms Scanlan suffered a  heart attack while driving to a stressful management meeting in April four years ago.

The Workers Compensation Commission ordered Woolworths to pay $433,650 to Ms Scanlan’s children because her stressful job, where she worked up to 70 hours a week, aggravated her deadly heart condition.
