The pilot who was killed when his helicopter hit a crane in central London was urged twice by his client, restaurant-owner Richard Caring, to abandon the planned flight because of bad weather.

Even as Pete Barnes, 50, was starting up his engines the client told him on the phone he ‘should not take off’ .

But Mr Barnes pressed on regardless while sending a text message to his client saying: ‘I’m coming anyway.’

Friends: Restaurant tycoon Richard Caring, left, who owns The Ivy, suggested pilot Peter Barnes postpone the journey to collect him because of poor weather

Up in flames: Half an hour later, Mr Barnes hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall

The ‘client’ who is not named in the
 report is understood to be restaurant tycoon Richard Caring who had 
been waiting at Elstree Aerodrome in Hertforsdhire to be picked up and 
flown to the north of England and who has spoken already of his 
‘devastation’ at his friend’s death.

The pilot was flying from Redhill Aerodrome to Elstree before being diverted to Battersea Heliport in central London.

The official AAIB air accident report
 shows the client suggested at least twice to the pilot that he should 
postpone the journey because of poor visibility.

'At 0718hrs, the client called the 
pilot to discuss the weather. The pilot said he thought the weather 
might clear earlier than forecast. The client said he would drive to 
Elstree and call the pilot to keep him advised.

'At 0731hrs, having noticed how poor 
the weather was during his journey, the client called the pilot to 
suggest that he did not take off until he (the client) had reached 
Elstree and observed the weather.

Up in flames: Despite his client advising him not to fly, Mr Barnes took and off and hit a high-rise crane on The Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall

The damaged crane on St George's Tower in Vauxhall, shortly after the crash, was shrouded in fog

The pilot replied that he was already starting the engines.

'The client stated that he repeated his suggestion that the pilot should not take off,' the report said.

Details of text messages sent and received by the pilot have also been revealed.

At 6.30am he told the client: 
'Weather OK up north but freezing fog at Elstree and Luton not clearing 
between 8-10am I've got same at Redhill keep you posted.'

He sent the client another message at 7.29am which stated: 'I'm coming anyway will land in a field if I have to.'

The pilot had been on his way to pick up restaurant and clubs tycoon Richard Caring, 62, when the crash happened.

Mr Caring was waiting at Elstree airport in Hertfordshire when the helicopter diverted to Battersea because of fog.

The helicopter disintegrated, killing Mr Barnes and a pedestrian, after it collided with the crane

Aftermath: Debris lies on the ground after the helicopter crashed into a construction crane in central London

Mr Caring, who runs a string of 
restaurants such as the Ivy and Annabel's, as well as the world-famous 
Wentworth golf course, had been waiting to be taken to Yorkshire on 
business.

He said last week: 'I flew with Pete Barnes for many years.

'He was a very dear friend and a 
very  accomplished pilot. My thoughts and prayers are  with his family 
during this awful time. I am devastated for their loss.'

A friend of the businessman said at 
the time: 'On the morning of the accident he was waiting at the airfield
 but was not aware the pilot had diverted.

'He is very upset by what had happened.'

Another
 pilot, who was aware of the journey planned by Mr Barnes, sent him a 
message which read: ‘Give me a call as I have checked weather and 
freezing fog around at the moment.'

Warning: Pilot Pete Barnes decided to fly his plane despite the bad weather even if it meant ' landing in a field'

Mr
 Barnes was on his way to collect his client when he was forced to 
change his route because of the bad weather. His final conversation was 
with air traffic control seven seconds before the crash.

Mr Barnes requested to land at London Heliport in Battersea. He asked: ‘Is Battersea open, do you know?’

After being told the heliport was open, he replied: ‘If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.’

Victim Matt Wood, who was described by his sister Amanda as a 'big guy with a big heart'. His inquest is yet to take place

Just
 15 seconds before hitting the crane, air traffic control told the 
pilot: ‘Battersea diversion approved, you're cleared to Battersea.’ His final words were: ‘Thanks a lot.’

The
 AAIB report stated: ‘This exchange ended at 0759.18 when G-CRST (the 
helicopter) was approximately 150 metres south-west of Vauxhall Bridge.

'Immediately
 afterwards the helicopter began to turn right. At 0759.25 it struck a 
crane on the south side of the river 275 metres from the south-west end 
of Vauxhall Bridge.’

The 
initial ‘special bulletin’ report by the AAIB also suggested that the 
solar-powered red warning lights on top of the crane were not switched 
on during the crash because the official requirement was that ‘the 
obstacle be lit at night only.’

It notes: ‘The crane was lit at night with red lights, both on its tower and jib.’

‘The tower lighting consisted of mains-powered steady red lights at approximately 50m intervals.

‘The jib lighting was provided by solar-powered lights.

‘The
 Air Navigation Order requires the lighting to be of medium intensity 
(2000 candela) and that the obstacles be lit at night only.’

But an official ‘notice to airmen’ warning had been issued about the structure.

Mr
 Barnes, a father of two from Berkshire, had 25 years' flying 
experience.

He had flown as an air ambulance pilot and in several films 
during his career, including Oscar-winning Saving Private Ryan and Tomb 
Raider II.

Pedestrian Mr Wood, from Sutton, Surrey, died from severe burns and a leg injury.

The Air
 Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report today revealed the last 
words of pilot Pete Barnes as he talked to air control moments before 
his helicopter crashed into a high-rise crane in Vauxhall at 8am on 
January 16.

Here is an edited transcript of what was said:

At 07.56am, pilot Pete Barnes requested to land at Battersea Airport, asking air control: 'Is Battersea open do you know?'

He then added: 'If I could head to Battersea that would be very useful.'

The controller replied: 'I'll just have a chat with them, see what their cloud is looking like.'

The helicopter was flying south parallel to the River Thames and, as it passed Westminster Bridge, began to descend.

At 07.58am hrs, the controller said: 'Battersea are just trying to find out if they can accept the diversion.'

The pilot acknowledged, after which the controller continued: 'And you can make it quite a wide hold, you can go as far as London Bridge.'

The helicopter crossed the north bank of the Thames at 1,000 ft heading south-west and began a right turn.

It was by now level at approximately 800 ft and altered course to follow the line of the river east towards Vauxhall Bridge.

At 07.59.10am the ATC controller said: 'Battersea diversion approved. You're cleared to Battersea.'

The pilot replied: 'Lovely thanks' before adding: ' Thanks a lot'.

The exchange ended at 07.59:18, when the helicopter was approximately 150m south-west of Vauxhall Bridge, and just seconds before it hit the crane on The Tower at St George Wharf.

The report details how the helicopter disintegrated after it collided with the crane, which was shrouded in fog.

It
 writes: 'The collision with the crane’s jib resulted in separation of 
the main rotor blades from the rotor head, and the rotor head and main 
gearbox from the fuselage of the helicopter.

'The cockpit airframe structure was also damaged.

'The main rotor head and gearbox landed separately from the fuselage and were further damaged by the impact with the ground.

'The
 tail section of the helicopter detached from the tail boom as the 
helicopter made contact with a building, before the fuselage struck the 
ground.

'The ground 
impact caused further extensive damage and the majority of the fuselage 
wreckage was consumed by a post-impact fire.'

The report comes after a crane driver today claimed he had been worried a helicopter would hit the high-rise structure months before the accident occurred.

Fears: The crane driver, who did not want to be named, said he was worried about an aircraft hitting the crane before the crash happened

He said one occasion he could almost see the eyes of some pilots as they 
came so close to the crane above the River Thames.

He added: 'It was very close. It was difficult to tell
 how close they were but you could almost see the whites of the pilot’s 
eyes.'

'When the first one came by I had no idea what it was. There was the sudden loud noise and it whipped right passed the cab.

'They
 came by pretty frequently and it was a bit worrying. It made you jump 
and it was certainly close enough that you worried the crane could be 
hit.'

Around
 3,500 aircraft fly through London airspace alone every day with the UK 
seeing 2.2million flights around the country every year.
