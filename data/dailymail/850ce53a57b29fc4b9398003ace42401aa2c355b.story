A Romanian gangster leader kept lions and bears at his Bucharest estate to scare rivals and victims, local press reports.

Ion Balint, known as 'Nutzu the Pawnbroke', kept four lions and two bears for a decade at his heavily guarded home, which is alleged to have included a torture chamber.

Balint, 48, has been indicted for heading a gang controlling the underworld in the Romanian capital, and had his animals impounded by authorities today.

‘You said I fed men to the lions?’ Balint is reported to have said, adding: ‘Why don't you come over and I'll give you some lions!’

Balint and his fellow gang members are charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, blackmail and illegally possessing weapons.

Balint kept the lions and bears, as well as thoroughbred horses and canaries, at his high-walled and heavily guarded estate in the poorest part of Bucharest.

There has been rumours of the estate being fitted with a torture chamber and Balint using the animals to strike fear in his opponents, claims which has been rubbished by his family.

‘Many untruths are being reported,’ Balint's son-in-law Marius said.

Earlier today, the lions and bears were sedated, put in cages and taken to a zoo by environmental authorities and animal welfare officers.

The animals, which generally appeared in good condition, may be eventually relocated in South Africa, animal welfare officers said.

Bystanders and relatives who gathered near the gates of the estate described Balint as a good neighbour and an animal lover, and said they were not bothered by roaring lions.

‘We can hear them every day but only when they're hungry or the female is in heat,’ said Gabriela Ionescu, 36, robed in a dressing gown and clutching her toddler daughter's hand.

‘They don't disturb us at all.’

Baliunt is has no documentation or health records for the animals, which he has kept illegally for 10 years, Mircea Pupaza, commissioner of the National Environment Guard said.

He could face a year in prison and a hefty fine for illegally keeping wild animals.

‘The lions are a status symbol for him,’ welfare authority spokesman Livia Cimpoeru said, declining to speculate whether they were used for threats or torture.

Authorities allege that Balint and his brother Vasile headed a criminal network which controlled much of the underworld activity in Bucharest.

Some 400 police and detectives were involved in the investigation which led to the arrest last week of 67 suspects, including the Balint brothers.

In 2009, Balint was convicted of human trafficking, violence and pimping, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. That was reduced to six years but Balint was freed from prison after a year, and rode away on a black stallion.
