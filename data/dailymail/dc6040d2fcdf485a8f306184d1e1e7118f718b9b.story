Tinder has quickly settled a sexual harassment suit brought against the company by one of the app's co-founders.

Whitney Wolfe, 24, has been awarded an undisclosed amount of money after claiming she was harassed and forced out of the company when her romantic relationship with Chief Marketing Officer and co-founder Justin Mateen, 28, soured.

It has also been revealed that Mr. Mateen is no longer with Tinder, or parent company IAC.

'Whitney’s lawsuit against Tinder has been resolved (without admission of wrongdoing),' John Mullan, a partner at Rudy, Exelrod, Zieff & Lowe, LLP, the firm representing Miss Wolfe, said in an email to BuzzFeed. 

'She is proud of her role as a co-founder of Tinder and of the role she played in the app’s success. She is now pleased to be able to focus her energy, talents, and ideas on exciting new opportunities.'

Documents released by Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday morning showed that Miss Wolfe dropped the case. 

In a series of vitriolic texts submitted as part of the lawsuit and seen by MailOnline, Mr. Mateen accused his former lover of being 'heartless,' threatened to 's*** on' a love rival, and berated her for 'flirting' and spending time with Muslim men, whom he referred to as 'Muslim pigs.'

In one text he even told Miss Wolfe, 'Ul regret acting this way once my tenderness for you wear off from ur behavior.'

In her complaint, filed on June 30, Miss Wolfe stated that Mr. Mateen subjected her to 'horrendously sexist, racist, and otherwise inappropriate comments, emails and text messages.'

She was then, ultimately, fired by the company.

Undisclosed sum: It is not known how much Miss Wolfe has received in her settlement

The torrent of abuse to which Miss Wolfe alleged she was subjected to after ending her relationship with Mr. Mateen, which began in February 2013 and lasted until that December, has exposed a culture among Tinder's senior executive which went beyond 'frat-like,' according to her attorney.

Mr. Mateen had been suspended in the wake of the allegations, and now a source close to the company, who declined to be identified, has said he is no longer with Tinder or IAC.

Miss Wolfe had been seeking compensatory damages, including restitution, lost pay, and punitive damages, in her lawsuit.
