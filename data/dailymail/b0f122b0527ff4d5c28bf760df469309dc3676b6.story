To call this XCOM would be a major disservice to one of the finest names in tactical gaming.

For bar the well-realised time period, The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is nothing but another generic third-person shooter with XCOM elements uncomfortably shoe-horned in.

Set in the 1960s, you play Agent William Carter – the leader of a three-man squad sent to investigate various alien attacks.

Negative space: Gamplay gets repetitive very quickly - despite 2K's best efforts in enemy variation

To its credit, the uninspired combat holds up well. Using a Mass Effect-style command and abilities wheel spliced with a Gears of War cover-system, battles often involve sending your teammates down the flanks to draw fire, while you attack from the other side.

Each of your squaddies have their own abilities – for example the Engineer can deploy a floating turret and the Sniper has a useful Critical shot.

But where it falls down is in its implementation of a key XCOM principle – that being; when a character dies, they stay dead. Although your squad mates can die if not revived, main character Carter cannot – his fatality merely causing a respawn of the entire squad at the previous checkpoint. 

Thus, throughout the game’s 15-hour campaign, you never feel connected to the character in the same way you were your squad in XCOM: Enemy Unknown. There's no sense of urgency because you know a checkpoint is always there to save you.

Sure, it’s slightly annoying when a high-level squadmate is downed, but they all have no personality or character – and are replaced by yet another bot from a limitless supply of AI-controlled drones.

Weapons, too, have no wow factor. All seem slightly muted, with even the largest alien guns coming across as completely limp.

Another element uncomfortably borrowed from Enemy Unknown is player choice, and it's commendable that The Bureau – given its frequent delays in development – has kept this element in.

However, choices are too black and white often not presenting a moral dilemma but a clear cut: be nice, be nasty scenario. Wooden voice acting and average lip synching do the dialogue sections no favours, either.

You can even run around The Bureau's HQ - but apart from the odd mini-game, it's incredibly dull.

Boring: There are some nice touches but for the most part there's little to make The Bureau stand out

But by far the biggest nail in The Bureau’s coffin is the lack of co-operative multiplayer. In sticking so rigidly to the rules of the XCOM universe (that being, once your teammates die, they die), they’ve missed a golden opportunity to lift this game away from average. But even then, thrills would be predictable and offer nothing other titles – for example Gears of War – do better.

The Bureau isn’t a bad game. It’s just average. And in this day and age, that can be the kiss of death.

The Bureau: XCOM Declassified is out now.
