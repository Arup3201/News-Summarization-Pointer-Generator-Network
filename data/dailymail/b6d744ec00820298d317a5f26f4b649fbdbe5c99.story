Wearing tiny Christmas accessories, these newborn babies get into the spirit of the season.

Dressed in red, white and green, the youngsters look the picture of innocence as they pose, or, in some cases, sleep for the camera.

The images of the festive children were captured by American Adia Speer, of Pemberton, New Jersey.

The 35-year-old photographer purchased her first DSLR camera when her niece was born five years ago.

Adia says: 'From there, people started asking me to photograph their children.

'I haven't looked back since, and I think Christmas babies are  so special.

'For newborns especially, this is their first holiday and to be able to capture that for the parents is priceless.'

Varying from one to three hours for each photoshoot, Adia photographs the youngsters in Santa hats, munching on Christmas carrots and even posed in a little Christmas baskets. In this picture, Vera, under two weeks old, looks adorable wearing this woolly Santa hat

She continued: 'I'm always thrilled to make any theme the parents request, but a Christmas theme is probably my favourite.'

'When I look at these adorable images I see warm, fuzzy, peaceful newborns and happy older babies.

'Regarding the Christmassy props, I am always on the lookout!

'The question I'm always asking myself when I come across a potential prop is 'could a baby fit in this?'

Varying from one to three hours for each photoshoot, Adia photographs the youngsters in Santa hats, munching on Christmas carrots and even posed in a little Christmas baskets.

The festive babies range in age anywhere from just over a week old to ten months

Adia says: 'Not all newborns like to be swaddled or tolerate being put into a basket.' In this picture Brayden, under two weeks old, opens his eyes as he shows off his Christmas hat

The festive babies range in age anywhere from just over a week old to ten months.

Adia says: 'I think the initial vision is important but you need to always be open to making adjustments and being flexible.

'Babies have a mind and will of their own and what is right for them individually is most important.

'Not all newborns like to be swaddled or tolerate being put into a basket.'When people look at my photographs I always get such a positive reaction which is great.

'People love seeing photos of cute babies, and cute Christmas babies are even better.'
