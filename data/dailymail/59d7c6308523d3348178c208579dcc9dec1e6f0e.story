An 80-year-old man was Tasered, handcuffed and finally restrained on a stretcher after allegedly firing nine shots at police over a dispute with his daily newspaper.

Joseph Smith reportedly called 911 and threatened to kill himself and the dispatcher because he had 'some beef' with The Philadelphia Inquirer following the loss of his money in stocks.

When around 50 police and SWAT officers arrived at his apartment in Upper Darby, Philadelphia, the OAP screamed from his third-floor window: 'I'm not leaving without shooting!', it is claimed.

Over the next three hours, he allegedly fired nine rounds toward police in the building's courtyard, before threatening to shoot down a news helicopter  flying over the scene in Providence Road.

Minutes later, police launched tear gas into Smith's window, before throwing a stun grenade into his apartment and storming the room, Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told The Inquirer.

There, they reportedly discovered the pensioner crouched on all fours with a 9mm gun in his head.

Despite dropping the pistol, Smith allegedly lashed out at six officers who tried to detain him, persisting even when he was struck twice with a Taser.

Scene: When around 50 police officers arrived at the Lansdowne Towers Apartment Complex (pictured) in Philadelphia, the OAP allegedly screamed from his third-floor window: 'I'm not leaving without shooting!'

But two sets of handcuffs and a stretcher later, he was eventually transported out of the property at the Lansdowne Towers Apartment Complex, situated near Industrial Park Drive.

'He's one nasty senior citizen,' Supt Chitwood said following the incident at 7.45pm on Wednesday. 'When we tried to negotiate with him, he would scream all types of things.'

Supt Chitwood added that none of his officers had been struck by the fired bullets.

Following the alleged attack, police reportedly recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition - along with the 9mm gun and a .22-caliber rifle - from Smith's apartment.

During an interview with officers, the pensioner's family claimed that he had not slept for four days, Supt Chitwood said. It remains unclear whether Smith was intoxicated at the time.

'Let me tell you something: The way he was acting and how strong he was, he had to be on something, but I don't know for sure,' Supt Chitwood said. 

Smith is currently in custody at Delaware County Prison, according to the Delaware County Daily Times. He is likely to be charged with aggravated assault, firearms crimes and other charges.
