'Appalling state of neglect': Police and child protection officers described the mother-of-two's house as the dirtiest they had ever seen

A cruel mother who left her children to live in a squalid house filled with piles of rotting waste, dog mess, and even dead animals while she went out drinking has been jailed for two years.

The remains of a dead dog and a dead parrot still in its cage were discovered along with piles of mouldy food and filthy clothes by police and child protection officers who called to the house in Hull, which they described as the dirtiest they had ever seen.

The pets had starved to death after the woman failed to feed them, but she refused to dispose of their bodies, Hull Crown Court heard today.

Officers discovered four empty bottles of vodka in the kitchen of the 33-year-old barmaid's home - which she shared with her 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter - along with a lone lettuce and a cucumber.

They also reported an inch of water covering the floor of one room and filthy carpets in others.

The court was told the barmaid's children - who could not recall ever seeing their mother use the cooker and said they lived on takeaways - were left unclean and provided with no fresh clothes, while their mother spent her money on nights out, alcohol, and new outfits for herself.

Her son said his mother used his older sister as her 'child-minding slave'.

When arrested she told police she had no money, but was later found to have Â£400 in cash.

Handing the mother a two year prison sentence, Judge Simon Jack said he had never seen a home in such an 'appalling' state of neglect.

'In all the time I have been dealing with cases of this kind I have never seen pictures as bad as this which show the state of neglect in your home,' he said.

'It was appalling.'

Squalor: Inspectors who called to the filthy house in Hull discovered remains of a pet parrot that had starved to death

Neglect: The barmaid left her 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to fend for themselves amid the piles of mess

The mother-of-two chose spent her money on going out drinking rather than running her house and caring for her children, the court heard

The judge said that, unlike many cases of neglect he has dealt with which involve parents with 'low mental ability', the mother-of-two was 'perfectly capable' of running a home and holding down a job.

'You chose to prioritise your own job and social life going out drinking rather than the welfare of your own children,' he said.

'The effects on the children can be very serious indeed. The message it sends to children is they are not worth looking after.'

Crown barrister Mark Kendal told the court the house in Hull had no hot running water, a sink filled with greasy, dirty pots, and a freezer that was taped shut.

There were bags of rubbish dumped all over the house and the stairs, one child's bedroom and the landing had no carpet, just bare floorboards.

'Disgusting': The greasy sink was filled with dirty dishes and cutlery

Inspectors had to pick their way around mounds of rotting waste and mouldy food

The house contained no fresh food apart from a lone lettuce and a cucumber - but police found four empty vodka bottles in the kitchen

'The children could not remember when their mother last used the cooker or microwave,' Mr Kendal said.

'One of the children told the police he was hungry as all he had to eat at midday was a bacon sandwich bought from a shop.

'The environmental health team who visited the house to evict her described it as in a disgusting state. They said it was the worst premises they had ever been in.'

RSPCA officers also attended the house to recover the animals.

The unidentified woman was sentenced at Hull Crown Court today after pleading guilty to two charges of child cruelty by neglect at an earlier hearing.

She was also given a 12-month suspended prison sentence at Hull Magistrates Court after being charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty.

The 33-year-old has been banned from owning animals for life.Defence barrister John Thackray said: 'I have to concede this was a disgraceful incident of neglect.'

He said the woman was suffering from depression following the breakdown of her relationship and alluded to 'matters in her own childhood'.

But he added: 'These are not excuses...She buried her head in the sand.'
