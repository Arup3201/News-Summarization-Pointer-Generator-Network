Britain’s fattest teenager, 63 stone Georgia Davis, has vowed to lose weight, insisting: 'I'm sick of being like this. I want my life back.'

The 19-year-old called emergency services to the home she shares with her parents in Aberdare, Wales last month after discovering she could no longer stand up.

She was so big part of the house had to be demolished so she could be transported along a scaffold bridge in an exercise that involved took 50 emergency workers and cost £100,000.

Diet plan: Georgia Davis, 19 is vowing to trim her 63 stone frame after she was hospitalised because she can no longer walk

Miss Davis is currently hooked up to an oxygen tank on a specially-designed £4,000 bed while doctors at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil carry out tests.

She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin.

She has been given a special gown to wear after admitting she had outgrown all her own clothes and was forced to use a bedsheet to cover her modesty.

Hospital staff have put her on a strict, calorie-controlled, sugar-free diet and she is determined to stick to it and keep losing weight when she's finally fit enough to go home.

The teen told The Sun: 'This is the last time you'll see me like this.'

Major operation: It took 50 people to rescue Miss Davis from her home after she fell ill

While in hospital, Miss Davis spends 
her days playing board games, reading her favourite Twilight novels and 
reading the get well cards she has been inundated with.

The public response to her dramatic hospitalisation hasn't been all postive.

Last week she was forced to delete her Facebook page after she was targetted by cyberbullies who were taunting her online.

As
well as having her personal account abused the teenager also had to 
contend with one troll creating a new Facebook page called RIP Georgia 
Davis - which has since been taken down. The page said: 'You are just a 
big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope 
you die soon.

'You fat blob, you are adding 
millions of pounds to the tax payers bill. If I had my way I would wipe 
that fat grin off your face by making you pay us back.'

Another anonymous commenter said: 'Why don’t you just stop eating so much you fat fool.

'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.'

It was reported to the site by her friends and has now been removed.

One message on it read: '63-stone teen dies in hospital - as she hears McDonalds are banning her.'

And cyberbullies also took to the networking site Twitter to post vile jokes about her weight.

One said: 'Georgia Davis was asked what was her favourite instrument in school?

'She said the dinner bell.'

Another
wrote: 'Georgia Davis says she was depressed as she has just lost her 
boyfriend - Has she tried looking in the folds of her skin to see if 
he’s there?'

'I like my salads and I could have got her on it': Jade Tarrant said she could have helped Miss Davis lose weight again

The teen's best friend Jade Tarrant 
revealed how Miss Davis lost weight after moving in with her, but 
returned home to care for her sick father after he was diagnosed with 
lung cancer - and the weight piled back on.

Miss Tarrant said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again.

'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it.

'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

'It was the strain of caring for her ill parents which made her eat - it was eating as a way of coping.'

She thinks the world of her mum, she loves her and she loves her step-dad - she’s been through a lot.

'Her mum’s osteoporosis and her step-dad’s lung problems had a large impact on her.

'It went wrong when she moved back in with them, she was under a lot of stress and it put her back on the same spot.

'She went back to eating fatty foods and having huge portions every time we went out for a meal.'

Miss Davis eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 50-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

A
hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations 
and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals.

'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'
