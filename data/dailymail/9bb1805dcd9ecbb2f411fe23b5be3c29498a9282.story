Mollie King has fast become a front 
row regular and attendee at some of fashion's hottest parties - she was even unveiled as the first ever ambassador for Oasis.

Better yet, the star landed herself a modelling contract where she joined a roster of talent including Alexa Chung, Rita Ora, Lana Del Rey and Suki Waterhouse.

The 26-year-old singer has clearly enjoyed her foray into the fashion world revealing that she has hopes of designing her own range one day.

Speaking to MailOnline, the Maybelline Better Skin foundation ambassador said: 'I love doing the modelling I’m really 
enjoying it and learning lots from working with different photographers.

Dressed to impress: Mollie King showcased her 
incredible figure in form-fitting double denim as she posed up a storm 
in a positively flawless shoot for Maybelline cosmetics

'However my priorities for this year are with the band and with Oasis as
 I have another collection coming out with them in April.'

Mollie's
 'Loved By Mollie' AW13 collection for Oasis - a 45-piece capsule range
 handpicked by the 
well-dressed singer - went on to become one of their best-selling of all time - and fashion fans will be pleased to hear that The Saturday's star is considering turning her hand to designing.

'I would like to design, yes. Hopefully in the future.

'I've learnt
 so much from doing the campaign it’s been a really nice introduction 
for me because you don’t realise how much there is to learn so I’m 
really pleased I’ve done it this way round first and then would like to 
do into designing at some point,' she told us.

Fashion fan: Mollie hand-picked an edit for Oasis and has revealed that she will be back for round two - she even has hopes of designing her own collection one day

For now, however, Mollie is focusing on her duties as ambassador for Maybelline and, naturally, she's a big fan of the brand.

'Being part of a band I worry about foundation clogging my skin and I know with Better Skin that it’s good for the appearance of my skin day-by-day and is non-clogging whilst giving a dewy finish.'

Mollie maintains that her beauty regime is pretty minimal - she uses L’Oréal Paris Skin Perfection 15 Second Cleansing Oil twice a day and some Carita products on her skin.

Speaking about her closeness to her fellow Saturdays band members, Mollie said: 'We love to have girly chats about make-up and hair and we love to do things like watch an award ceremony and then discuss people's make-up and hair.'

Priorities: Mollie says she loved doing the modelling and has been learning lots from working with different photographers but her priorities lie with the band and her fashion duties

Despite spending a lot of time stateside and holding up fort on the front row, Mollie hasn't caught the juicing bug like her fellow celebrity friends.

'I take daily multivitamins but that’s it really,' she said of her health regime.

'I'm not a big fan of juices and I've never done a juice diet because I really like munching on my food and so don't really like the consistency of soups or smoothies. I would rather actually eat the fruit.'

While most women could only dream of having Mollie's toned figure, she recently insisted she just has to work with what she's got, and she wishes that she had a more curvaceous body. 

Best seller: Mollie's 'Loved By Mollie' AW13 collection for Oasis - a 45-piece capsule range handpicked by the well-dressed singer - went on to become one of their best-selling of all time

She said in an interview with the March 2014 edition of Cosmopolitan magazine: 'I don’t have a Kim Kardashian bum unfortunately, and I don’t have massive boobs either.

'You have to work with the bits you’re most proud of, so if I’m going out I always think, "Right, Molls, your legs are better than your cleavage, so go work those".

'I’m not that curvy, so I like to wear things that give me more shape than I’ve got. Everyone has their body hang-ups; I think, "Oh, I could tone that," or, "I wish I could change that."

'But as much as you can tone bits or add bits, you’re born with your body.'
