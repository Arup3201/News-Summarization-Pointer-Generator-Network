An FBI-style ‘Food Crime Unit’ should be set up to stop international gangs smuggling horse meat into processed food and takeaways, according to a new Government report.

Unannounced spot checks on factories and abattoirs should also be introduced alongside a ‘zero tolerance’ approach on anyone caught contaminating food, Professor Chris Elliott said in a review into last year’s horse meat scandal published this morning.

The food crime unit will be a new specialist team within the Food Standards Agency. It has been set up amid growing concerns that international gangs are moving away from drug trafficking and armed robbery into food crime.

Food experts have warned that the Government cannot be sure that there is no risk to public health from beefburgers contaminated with horse DNA

Prof Elliott said the British food industry was under pressure to 'reduce costs and maximise profits’, leaving families at risk.

He said: ‘Consumers are reliant on the leadership, good intentions and good practices of those who supply food and regulate it. Consumers expect government and industry to provide a food system which is safe, resilient and free from criminal interference.

‘Consumers must be able to trust that the food they consume is what it claims to be.’

He said that while all consumers were at risk from food fraud, poorer families spent a higher proportion of their income on processed foods which were more susceptible to fraud.

And he said: ‘Some consumers are at risk if they have to rely on others for food preparation, such as those in care homes, or hospitals.

‘Recent surveys by local authorities such as Leicester City Council, West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and West Sussex, and the consumer organisation Which? have shown that consumers using fast food outlets in inner city areas are often buying food which is not what it claims to be.

‘In some cases the evidence suggests that problems arose because of unintentional labelling mistakes, but there is a concern that other fast food outlets may have been sourcing cheaper meat which increased the risk of food fraud. ‘

Michael Ellis, assistant director of Interpol, said criminal gangs were turning away from drugs and trafficking to food fraud.

He said: ‘Criminals have realised that they can make the same amount of money by dealing with counterfeit food. Invariably the sentences are much lighter.

‘In my experience, the patterns used by criminals involved in counterfeiting are very similar to those used in the dealing of drugs.

‘They operate front companies, they employ front bank accounts, they will have false declarations for the movement of their goods, they will mis-declare their shipments.’

Prof Elliot said British consumers needed more protection from food crime gangs exploiting soft sentences to rake in huge profits by lacing food with chemicals and cheap meats.

And he said consumers must be put first by ensuring that their needs in relation to food safety and food crime prevention are the ‘top priority’.

Coordinated police raids  across 33 countries in North America, Asia and Europe last year found widespread abuse.

More than 131,000 litres of oil and vinegar, 20 tonnes of spices and condiments, nearly 430,000 litres of counterfeit drink and 45 tonnes of dairy products were seized. In addition, 96 people were arrested.

Findus lasagnes were found to have contained horse meat last year, forcing the firm to withdraw the frozen meals from its French supplier, Comigel

Food crime can have deadly consequences.

In China in 2008, an industrial chemical called melamine was added to baby milk to increase its protein content. 

Six babies died of severe kidney damage as a result.

In the Czech Republic in 2012, more than 40 people were killed by vodka and rum that had been laced with methanol.

Government advisor Prof Elliot has called for a series of measures to tackle the threat of similar tragedies happening in Britain. 

In his report this morning he called for: 

Food crime can have fatal consequences. In China in 2008, an industrial chemical, melamine, was added to increase the protein content of baby milk. Six babies died of severe kidney damage as a result.

In the Czech Republic in 2012, more than 40 people were killed by vodka and rum that had been laced with methanol.

Mr Ellis told the BBC: ‘Counterfeiting impacts on everyone. The criminals have no care at all for the hygiene or bacterial content in the end product. They just want the brand name in order to get their money.’

In Britain the consumer group Which? tested 60 lamb takeaways and found that 24 of them contained other meats such as beef or chicken. The meat in five samples couldn't be identified at all.

Following the report, the Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: 'When a shopper picks something up from a supermarket shelf it should be exactly what it says on the label, and we’ll crack down on food fraudsters trying to con British consumers.

'As well as keeping up confidence here, we need to protect the great reputation of our food abroad. We’ve been opening up even more export markets, which will grow our economy, provide jobs, and support the Government’s long-term economic plan.

'The action we’re taking gives more power to consumers - meaning they’ve got better labelling on food, better education about where their food comes from, and better, locally-sourced food in schools and hospitals.'

But Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: 'Consumers were rightly outraged by the horsemeat scandal, yet the Government has dragged its heels and made absolutely no progress in the 18 months since it happened.

'David Cameron approved changes to the structures of government that weakened consumer protection, culminating in the horsemeat scandal. The confusion this caused is highlighted in today’s report yet the Government have totally failed to admit they got this wrong and have still not reversed the misguided decision to fragment the Food Standards Agency.

'The food industry is the largest single manufacturing sector in the UK, millions of jobs depend on consumer confidence. The Government must now show leadership and establish an effective food crime unit as recommended in the report that can protect the integrity of the food we eat as soon as possible.'
