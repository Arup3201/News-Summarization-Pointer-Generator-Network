Pete Nelson is an architect with lofty ambitions. For the past 15 years he has made childhood dreams a reality with his unique treehouses.

The 50-year-old from Seattle, sometimes known as the 'tree whisperer' is now branching out with his own reality TV show, Treehouse Masters, on Animal Planet.

'Treehouses are directly connected with nature,' Mr Nelson said. 'We are in the arms of these trees.'

Since starting his Washington state business, Nelson Treehouse, the designer has constructed hundreds of hideaways in 26 states and nine countries.

From a 800 square foot 'retreat' in Waco, Texas, complete with full bathroom and giant flatscreen TV, to the 'Spirit House Retreat in Rhinebeck, New York, built with guidance from a shaman, Mr Nelson is a master of making dreams come true.

His work is being featured in an eight-part series on Animal Planet, which started last week.

The show follows the architect and his team as they travel the U.S., climbing trees and working on plans for clients.

'The way people respond is remarkable. Treehouses bring together families, friends and even entire communities,' Mr Nelson told USA Today.

This is certainly the case for Mr Nelson's family. His fascination with treehouses began when he was five-years-old and his father helped him build one.

Now a father himself, Mr Nelson is helped in his business by his 21-year-old carpenter son Charlie, and 23-year-old daughter Emily.

Although treehouses are considered a den for children, Mr Nelson admits many of his customers are adults who are looking for a retreat from the world.

'I get calls all the time for kids’ 
treehouses. But I think the adults who are placing the calls are hiding 
the fact that the treehouse is for them,' he told The New York Times.

'Some people look at these 
treehouse books and say, "I want one of those". Or they’re architecture 
buffs. They don’t have the skills to create it, but they want it.'

Whereas Mr Nelson's first treehouse that he built with his father was a simple affair, his designs today are spectacular.

His portfolio includes luxury homes perched on branches, a tiny red 'brew house with peacock window and brewery inside, and a round treehouse made out of cork tiles, that has a grass roof and fireplace in the center.

'The difference in the treehouse is that it’s a place 
where you are absolutely away from it all. Every one of these structures
 is a place to unplug and unwind,' he said.

The most expensive treehouse Mr Nelson built was in Yelm, Washington, for more than $365,000.

The biggest was built on seven oaks in San Diego, but it was destroyed in wildfires.

'The owner said that after the wildfire, you couldn’t fit the ashes in a bottle. It was that gone,' Mr Neson told the New York Times.

An integral part of Mr Nelson's business is selecting the perfect tree or trees for his buildings. He says the Douglas fir and red cedar trees are the best, being both strong and beautiful.

'I think my greatest strength in this fun little biz is interpreting what they're giving us,' he said.

However, the cottonwood is considered too dangerous to build in, Mr Nelson said, adding: 'On the most calm and beautiful days, there will be a gunshot sound, and a massive limb of a cottonwood tree will fall down.'

Mr Nelson, who has produced coffee table books of his designs, added: 'The energy a tree emits is undeniable. It's the sort of energy that makes the hairs stand up on your neck a little bit.'

While Mr Nelson may be in an expert in picking the right tree to build around, his company must also negotiate planning regulations.

Patrick Fulton who wrote The Treehouse Guide, told USA Today: 'Some areas don't consider treehouses to be a building at all, whereas others specifically mention them with maximum-height and floor-size limits.'

Mr Nelson's love for treehouses has also led him to open a unique bed and breakfast in a Washington forest.

With his wife Judy, he runs Treehouse Point, a collection of amazing lodges high in the trees, where people can stay, or hold weddings and concerts.

While Mr Nelson's design cost anywhere between $80,000 and $200,000 to create, his passion for treehouses is such that he encourages like-minded people to create their own.

Websites such as Craigslist can be a great source of materials for a treehouse and, with a little help from the whole family, it shouldn't take long to create a retreat.

'Treehouses are priceless, especially the simple one that dad builds in the backyard,' Mr Nelson said.
