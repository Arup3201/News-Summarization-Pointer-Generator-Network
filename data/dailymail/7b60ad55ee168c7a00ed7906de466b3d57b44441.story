Sixty Conservative MPs, including Dr Liam Fox, are today backing a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools.

Sixty Conservative MPs are today backing a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of grammar schools.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox, the chairman of the influential 1922 committee, Graham Brady, and former leadership contender David Davis are among those calling for an end to the ban on new selective state schools.

The grassroots Tory group, Conservative Voice, is building support among MPs for a change in policy which it says would be a vote-winner among millions of middle-class parents.

At present, the law forbids new grammar schools, whose intake is based on academic ability -- only allowing existing institutions to open ‘satellites’ in new locations.

Theresa May, the home secretary, and Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, have broken ranks to back plans for new satellite grammar school campuses in their constituencies.

The option is being attempted by Conservative councillors in Kent, where Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge has applied to open a site nine miles away in Sevenoaks.

Mr Cameron has long resisted calls to pledge to expand selective schooling in the Tory manifesto.

The architects of the coalition’s school reforms hoped that controversy over grammar schools in the party could be put to rest by focusing specialist academies and free schools.

But Dr Fox said: ‘Diversity in the provision of education has been a central theme of this government’s policy and should be extended wherever possible.’

Mr Davis, the former shadow home secretary, said: ‘Grammar schools were probably one of the most transformative public policies of the middle of the 20 century. They took a very large population of working class kids and gave them opportunities that they would never have got any other way.’

Mr Brady said: ‘As most local authorities got rid of their grammar schools, we have seen social mobility take a nosedive and a less cohesive society.

‘We have seen far fewer people from state educated backgrounds in law, the upper reach of the civil service, the judiciary and indeed in politics and we must return to the sense that anybody can get on according to their ability and their efforts – that is what brought me into the Conservative Party.’

A poll last week showed that 54 per cent of voters say that they would support entirely new grammar schools in areas where there was evidence parents wanted them, such as petitions in support.

Don Porter, founder of Conservative Voice, the grassroots party pressure group which is behind the new campaign, said 60 MPs had so far offered their support.

‘We want to ensure that in the Conservative Party manifesto there is a clear commitment to reverse the legislation preventing the creation of new grammar schools,’ he added.

‘Our followers are strongly of the opinion that new grammar schools will both enhance social mobility and present parents with choice, both of which lie at the heart of the Conservative Party’s values.’

Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘There’s no silver bullet to reviving stagnant social mobility in Britain. But grammar schools are a key piece of the policy jigsaw, creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard-working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters.’

Research for Conservative Voice found 84 per cent of people said that grammar schools are a valuable asset to the British education system. Some 80 per cent believe that grammar schools make the education system fairer.

Two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11+ exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed.

In the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher - herself a grammar school girl - allowed local councils to decide themselves whether their schools should remain selective grammars when she was the education secretary.

It proved to be a political misjudgement, since many councils took the opportunity to end selective state education.

There are now around 160 grammar schools left in England, mostly in the home counties.
