Babies have the capacity to learn and remember sounds of language from their mother during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy

Babies start to learn language before they are even born, scientists have discovered.

Previously, it was believed that newborns begin to discriminate between language sounds within their first 
months of life.

But a new study indicates that babies have the capacity to learn and remember elementary sounds of their language 
from their mother during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy.

'We have known for over 30 years that we
begin learning prenatally about voices by listening to the sound of our
mother talking,'  said Christine Moon, a professor of psychology at Pacific Lutheran University, who led the research.

'[But] this is the first study that shows we 
learn about the particular speech sounds of our mother's language before
we are born.'

Forty girls and boys, about 30-hours-old , were studied in Tacoma and Stockholm, Sweden.

The babies heard either Swedish or English vowels and they could control how many times they heard the vowels by sucking on a dummy connected to a computer.

Vowel sounds were chosen for the study 
because they are prominent, and the researchers thought they might be 
noticeable in the mother’s ongoing speech, even against the noisy 
background sounds of the womb.

In both countries, the 
babies at birth sucked longer for the foreign language than they did for
their native tongue, regardless of how much postnatal 
experience they had.

Early learning: New research has is indicated that babies learn vowel sounds in utero

This indicated to researchers that they were 
learning the vowel sounds in utero.

Patricia Kuhl, co-author and 
co-director of the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at the 
University of Washington, added: 'We thought infants were 'born 
learning' but now we know they learn even earlier. They are not 
phonetically naïve at birth.

'We want to know what magic they put to 
work in early childhood that adults cannot.

'We can't waste 
that early curiosity. The mother has first dibs on influencing the child's brain.

'The vowel sounds in her speech are the loudest units and the fetus locks onto them.'
