Coalition tensions over immigration boiled over last night after the Home Office launched a provocative poster campaign telling illegal immigrants to ‘go home’.

The Liberal Democrats reacted furiously to the initiative, with party president Tim Farron condemning the billboards as the ‘politics of division’, and saying they should be ‘shredded’.

In a separate intervention, Vince Cable said the Coalition’s immigration policy was ‘totally illogical’ and ‘very damaging’ to the economy.

The Business Secretary said that 
cracking down on foreign students and skilled workers from outside 
Europe when the public is mainly concerned about mass immigration from 
the European Union was ‘like having a family quarrel and trying to 
resolve it by kicking the cat’.

The giant billboards, which are being driven around on the back of vans, say: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.’

Illegal immigrants are offered a number to text for ‘free advice and help with travel documents’.

Tory Immigration Minister Mark Harper
 said the controversial poster campaign would encourage illegal 
immigrants to leave voluntarily – and serve as ‘an alternative to being 
led away in handcuffs’.

Speaking at the launch of the 
campaign, Mr Harper said the initiative was ‘just another part of the 
reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net 
migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade’.

The initiative is being piloted in six London boroughs but could be extended nationally if successful. The
 billboards also display the number of illegal migrants arrested 
recently in the area the vans are visiting. The blunt message will also 
be displayed in leaflets, posters and advertisements in local 
newspapers.

Critics claim that illegal immigrants face only a minimal risk of deportation.

The Commons home affairs select 
committee reported this month that the now-defunct UK Border Agency had 
left behind a backlog of more than 500,000 cases, which would take 37 
years to clear at the current rate of progress.

But the Home Office campaign prompted an angry response from the Lib Dem part of the Coalition.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘These 
poster vans were not cleared or agreed by Lib Dems in government. We are
 totally committed to tackling illegal immigration but this is a 
disproportionate, distasteful and ineffective way to do it.’

Mr Farron wrote on Twitter: ‘These 
“Go home” posters are the politics of division – the billboards must be 
shredded, and now.’ Lib Dem peer Lord Roberts of Llandudno, also raised 
the ‘dreadful Home Office campaign’ in the House of Lords, saying the 
posters were ‘creating a great divide in our communities’.

The poster campaign also drew 
unexpected criticism from UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who
 described the initiative as a ‘diversion’ from the issue of legal mass 
immigration from the EU.

Mr Farage told ITV’s Daybreak 
programme the posters were a direct response to UKIP’s surge in the 
polls. But he said voters wanted action on immigration, not publicity 
stunts.

‘I think the tone of the billboards 
is nasty, unpleasant, Big Brother,’ he said. ‘I don’t think using 
messages like this will make any difference. What will make a difference
 is enforcing our borders properly.

‘It’s also a diversion: the real 
problem isn’t illegal immigration, there are perhaps one million illegal
 immigrants in the country. The real problem is that on January 1st next
 year we’re opening up our borders to 28million people from Bulgaria and
 Romania.’

Meanwhile, Mr Cable has attacked  the
 Government’s Tory-led immigration policy. He said there was a sense of 
‘panic’ among Tory ministers in their response to public concern about 
mass immigration from the EU, which the Government can do little about.

Answering questions after delivering 
the Management Consultancies Association annual lecture, Mr Cable said 
the immigration policy ‘doesn’t actually deal with the problem that 
people worry about’.

He said implementation of the policy was ‘very, very damaging in many respects’.

Mr Cable added: ‘It doesn’t sit very 
easily with being open for business. My job is to attract inward 
investment and show that we are open for business.’

He said overseas students were not 
actually immigrants, but were included in the Government’s cap on 
immigrants from outside the EU. ‘It is totally illogical, but that is 
the policy,’ he added.

The row comes as the Tories step up both action and rhetoric on immigration in the run-up to the next election.

David Cameron warned this week that immigration is a ‘constant drain’ on public services. He
 also suggested that he wanted to see more action towards meeting his 
pledge to slash annual net migration – the number of immigrants minus 
the number emigrating – from more than 200,000 to the ‘tens of 
thousands’.

Last year the number of immigrants fell by 89,000 to 153,000.
