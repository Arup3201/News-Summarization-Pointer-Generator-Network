Archaeologists who discovered an ancient site which could be key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Stonehenge are calling on the government to rethink  plans for a tunnel under the 5,000 year-old monument.

Plans were announced last month for the 1.8 mile tunnel, costing up to £1billion, underneath the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire to help relieve one of Britain's most traffic-congested roads.

Both the National Trust and English Heritage had welcomed the announcement which will give better public access to the wider prehistoric landscape and will benefit local wildlife.

Transport groups are also hoping it will ease the traffic jams on the A303, one of the main routes into the South West, which have plagued motorists for decades.

But archaeologists are calling on the government to rethink its plans after a new site was discovered nearby which could be key to unlocking the mystery surrounding Stonehenge.

They warn that the chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be 'wrecked' if the tunnel goes ahead.

A series of digs 1.5miles away at Amersbury, next to the A303, has unearthed evidence of a settlement that pre-dates Stonehenge by thousands of years.

Blick Mead is thought to have been occupied by hunter-gatherers returning to Britain after the Ice-Age when the country was still attached to mainland Europe.

Thousands of tools have been discovered at the Mesolithic feasting site as well as evidence of giant bulls known as aurochs and possible structures.

Archaeologist David Jaques, who made the discovery of Blick Mead, said it could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past 

But the site could be destroyed if plans for a 1.8 mile tunnel go ahead experts have warned.

Archaeologist David Jaques, who made the discovery of the encampment, told The Daily Telegraph: 'The prime minister is interested in re-election in 140 days – we are interested in discovering how our ancestors lived six thousand years ago.'

He added: 'Blick Mead could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries – an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past.

'But our chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.'

David Cameron had announced the plans to create a duel carriageway on the A303 and build a new tunnel to take traffic away from the world heritage site on an earlier visit Stonehenge.

It came as part of a £15 billion package of road schemes which also include adding extra lanes to some motorways,improvements to junctions on the M25, to the A27 in Sussex, and on approaches to Liverpool and the A1 in the north east.

But Mr Jacques warned the only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain’s history 'could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.'

Professor Tim Darvill, of Bournemouth University has described this as 'This is the most important discovery at Stonehenge in over 60 years.'

Experts are calling on the government to rethink plans to build on the critically important landscape.

Andy Rhind-Tutt, of Amesbury and chairman of the Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, added: 'Traffic congestion to one of the country's most visited attractions will not be solved by a tunnel with one exit lane – the current tailback can extend five miles and can take two hours to get through.

'Any tunnel would need to be motorway standard, and even with four lanes there would still be tailbacks.

'A much more practical solution would be to reroute the A303 supporting South Wiltshire as well as the West Country.'
