She's been modelling since the 1980s, has mothered three children and was - and still is - a permanent fixture on the London party season.

But as Yasmin Le Bon celebrates her half century today, she still looks as youthful as she did in the 1987's Guess? campaign that made her a household name.

Whether she's showcasing her enviable curves in a Speedo campaign or stomping down the runway with her daughter at London Fashion Week, Yasmin truly defies her years.

In celebration of her big 5-0, FEMAIL has rounded up the timeless supermodel's best moments.

Born in Oxford to an Iranian father and English mother, Yasmin's modelling career began early.

After a few local modelling gigs, she was snapped up by esteemed agency, Model 1 in London. 

What's her secret? Yasmin, who today turns 50, was unveiled as the face and body of the Speedo Sculpture swimwear collection earlier this year

She then went on to become one of the highest earning models of the 1980s, appearing on the glossy covers of the first American and British issues of Elle; campaigns for Guess?, M&S and Matthew Williamson followed. 

She has also worked for Banana Republic, Calvin Klein, Versace, Chanel, Christian Dior and Avon. 

Clearly not letting her age define her, Yasmin is still the cover girl for high-end brands and looks the picture of youth as she models Winser London's AW14 offering.

Snapped up by the brand for the fourth consecutive season, Winser London believe that the supermodel and mother captures the spirit of their brand perfectly.

'She is stunning, stylish and real,' said the founder. 'Yasmin juggles a busy career, family and husband, like so many women today, yet she always looks effortlessly elegant and is always fun to be with.'

This isn't the only brand Yasmin has been lending her good looks to this year.

Yasmin was unveiled as the face and body of the Speedo Sculpture swimwear collection.

With more than thirty years of experience behind her, Yasmin has developed a handbook to help women overcome body issues and feel more confident and comfortable in their swimwear.

Speaking about this, Yasmin said: 'After spending 33 years on the modelling circuit I have heard all of the tricks of the trade.

'The best advice I've received on looking your best in a swimsuit, is to wear it with confidence and a smile; it instantly changes your appearance.' 

She has three children, including her famous model daughter, Amber, with Simon Le Bon, lead singer of Duran Duran and earlier this year opened and closed the Gyunel show at London Fashion Week with her 25-year-old daughter.
