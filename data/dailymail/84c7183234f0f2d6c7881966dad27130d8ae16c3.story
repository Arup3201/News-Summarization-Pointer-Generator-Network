A 30-year-old child care worker who died after a routine bowel operation could have survived if doctors had taken her health concerns seriously, a coroner said today.

Kirsty Woods died of an infection 
just 12 days after her operation at Barnsley Hospital, despite she and her family 
expressing their worries about her deteriorating health on a number of occasions.

Miss Wood was admitted to Barnsley Hospital with suspected gastric flu but was subsequently diagnosed with colitis.

She had the operation to remove part of her large intestine because it was inflamed. But doctors failed to spot the surgical stitches had ruptured, causing the fatal infection. She died on September 21, 2010 after having a heart attack.

Three days before Kirsty was vomiting and hallucinating.

Coroner David Urpeth, who recorded a narrative verdict, said: 'These were not taken sufficiently seriously or acted upon appropriately.

'If the peritonitis had been diagnosed earlier Kirsty would have been able to undergo further surgery and would very likely have survived.'

Pathologist Dr Kim Suvarna said the childcare worker, who was 'otherwise fit and healthy', could have survived if the infection had been diagnosed earlier.

'She should have walked through this type of surgical procedure easily.

'I’m surprised this degree of inflammation and abdomen catastrophe was not identified and dealt with at an earlier stage.'

Kirsty, from Penistone, near Barnsley, South Yorks, was admitted to hospital on August 21 after suffering sickness, diarrhoea and pain in her abdomen.

Doctors tried treating her with steroids and other medication but when she failed to improve, they decided to operate.

Surgeon Theodore Offori said Kirsty had a raised pulse throughout her recovery but peritonitis was never suspected.

He said it was ‘debatable’ whether a CT scan should have been done earlier and denied anything should have been done differently.

Surgical registrar Christopher Whitfield agreed her heart rate was high but said blood pressure was normal following the operation.

When he visited her five days later she complained of pain in her abdomen and was suffering from diarrhoea.

He said he thought she was suffering a common side effect to bowel surgery, where the bowel fails to propel or absorb the contents properly.

Another doctor flagged up the possibility of a leaking bowel but X- rays showed no signs and were consistent with his diagnosis, he said.

He admitted her chances of survival would have improved if the leak had been detected earlier.

Miss Woods' father Bernie, 62, who was with son Peter and daughter Kelly at the inquest, described the verdict as bittersweet.

He said: 'I’m satisfied as we has proved what we said all along. This could have been prevented.

'After her mum died she was my right hand. She loved her family and she’s really missed.'

Medical director Dr Jugnu Mahajan, medical director at the hospital, said he was sorry for their loss.

'We will now carefully consider the coroner’s findings to ensure the chances of a such a tragic event happening again are absolutely minimised,' he said.
