The first picture has emerged of the 79-year-old African American victim of an alleged racially-motivated 'knockout game' assault.

Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, has been charged with a hate crime for allegedly filming himself sucker-punching the elderly man, breaking his jaw and knocking out his teeth, last month. The victim has not been named.

Barrett today made a brief appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances Stacy, who scheduled a detention hearing for the Katy man.

According to prosecutors, the 
attack happened on November 24 in Katy, Texas, but it wasn't until 12 days later that 
authorities connected the attack to the cellphone video of it.

Authorities
 learned of the case because Barrett allegedly showed the video on the 
night of the attack to an off-duty arson investigator he had just met at
 a restaurant in nearby Folshear.

According
 to the criminal complaint, Barrett asked the off-duty investigator and 
the woman with the investigator if they knew about the knockout game.

He
 told them he played earlier that day, then showed them the video, 
prosecutors allege.

The investigator then flagged down a uniformed officer across the street and led him to Barrett.

The
 attack video doesn't show Barrett's face, but investigators matched his
 voice to the voice in the video and the couple at the restaurant told 
investigators that Barrett was wearing the same shorts and shoes at the 
person who shot the video.

According to prosecutors, the video 
shows Barrett approach the victim and ask, 'How's it going, man?'

A 'loud smack' is then heard, the victim falls to the ground, Barrett 
laughs and says, 'Knockout'. The assailant then flees in his vehicle.

The victim lost three teeth and needed surgery to repair his jaw, which had been broken in two places. He was hospitalized for more than four days, authorities said.

Investigators retrieved other videos from Barrett's phone, including some in which he uses racial epithets and talks about trying to work up the courage to play the knockout game, the complaint states.

In one, Barrett says: 'That plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?'

U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson said yesterday that such crimes won't be tolerated.

'Evidence of hate crimes will be vigorously investigated and 
prosecuted with the assistance of all our partners to the fullest extent
 of the law,' Magidson said.

Barrett's attorney, George Parnham, 
said Barrett has bipolar disorder and has been prescribed heavy 
medications to treat it. He said Barrett's family 'feels horribly 
sympathetic' for the person who was attacked.

'When you start 
peeling back the layers of the onion and look at the mindset behind the 
action you soon realize there's a mental issue,' said Parnham, who added
 that he's trying to gather as much information about Barrett's mental 
health as possible.

If convicted of the hate crime charge, Barrett could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined up to $250,000.
