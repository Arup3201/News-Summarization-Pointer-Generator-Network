Lowering the voting age to 16 will be among Ed Miliband's first acts if he wins the next election, Labour will say today.

Shadow
 justice secretary Sadiq Khan will say that lowering the voting age is 
one of the party's top priorities as it seeks to restore public trust in
 politics.

The Tories 
have dismissed the idea as 'student politics', and accused Labour of 
pandering to the trade unions, who have demanded a cut in the voting 
age.

Sadiq Khan will claim today that the change could play a key part in tackling 'the public's malaise towards all things political'

Labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move because the 16 and 17-year-old age group are considered more likely to vote in its favour.

But Mr Khan will claim today that the change could play a key part in tackling 'the public's malaise towards all things political'.

Mr Khan wants to have the legislation in place in time for the London mayoral elections in 2016, in which he is tipped as a possible Labour candidate. This would require legislation immediately after the 2015 election to give young people time to register to vote.

'I'd love it if we can get the law changed in time for the next London mayoral contest,' he will say today.

'Getting the public into the habit of voting is clearly a key part of any solution if we are to raise the numbers of those who participate in elections.

'We need to get people hooked on voting at an early age because the evidence shows if you vote when you first become eligible you're more likely to keep on voting for the rest of your life.

'Don't vote when you're young and you're more likely to never vote.

'Changing the law and extending those eligible to vote would mean governments in the future would be foolish to ignore their voice.'

Mr Miliband publicly backed the idea of votes at 16 at last year's Labour conference, when he said: 'Let's give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let's give the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds and make them part of our democracy.'

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of caving in to union demands to politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school.

Other countries where voting is permitted at 16 include Austria, Nicaragua, Brazil and Ecuador.

Youngsters aged 16 and 17 will also be allowed to vote in this year's referendum on Scottish independence.
