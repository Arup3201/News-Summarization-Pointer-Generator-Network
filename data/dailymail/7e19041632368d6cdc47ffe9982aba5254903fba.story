Lionel Messi equalled Raul's Champions League record by reaching 71 goals in 90 games as Barcelona beat Ajax to reach the last 16.

Playing against his old club, Luis Suarez is without a goal in his first three games for Barcelona but Messi's double at least meant the former Liverpool striker got his first win for his new club.

Messi scored from Pedro's cross on 76 minutes to reach Raul's landmark and book Barca's place in the knockout stages.

Suarez's best opportunity to open his account came on the hour when Messi played him through. He had promised not to celebrate if he scored against his former club and the promise was not tested as Jasper Cillessen came out to save his shot. 

Gerard Pique was once again out in the cold this time not in the stands but on the bench as Luis Enrique paired Marc Bartra with Javier Mascherano. Xavi took his place in midfield to draw level with Iker Casillas on a record 144 Champions League games, but all eyes were on Suarez.

The man who scored over 100 goals for Ajax in little more than 150 games, captained them to success in the Dutch Cup final in his final full season and played enough games in his last campaign – before moving to Liverpool in January 2011 – to earn a league winners medal has always enjoyed the unstinting support of the club's supporters even during what was a troubled last season at the club marred by a ban for biting Otman Bakkal. They cheered his name as the Barcelona team was read out and just hoped he would net score his first Barcelona goal against them.

Barcelona's former player Marc Overmars, who is now Sporting Director at Ajax, described the Barcelona front three that Suarez now makes up with Messi and Neymar as 'a dream' before the game but this was the first time the fantastic three had finished the game with three points; albeit after a difficult first half.

Neymar had the ball in the net on four minutes but his goal was ruled out for offside and it was the last we saw of Barcelona's attack for a while as Ajax domintated.

Lucas Anderson picked up on a poor clearance from Dani Alves and shaved a post with his shot and Marc-Andre ter Stegen then had to turn Davy Klassen's shot away for a corner as Ajax had their first chances.

Stegen's save and some timely interceptions from Jordi Alba and Mascherano were all that was keeping Ajax at bay. Suarez forced a corner to give Barcelona some much-needed respite but Ajax were laying siege to Barca's goal. Alba handled in the box and was lucky to escape without conceding a penalty. At the other end he forced a save from Cillessen but Ajax remained on top.

They were furious when El Ghazi stayed down injured in the Barcelona area and the visitors played on and forced a free-kick at the other end.

Messi took the kick and Cillessen saved brilliantly but seconds later he made the mistake that would cost Ajax the lead. He came for a 50-50 ball with Bartra, lost the race. The central defender crossed from the byline and Messi scored with a looping header.

It was the most unusual of goals – a Messi header from a cross from a centre-half – but it calmed Barca's nerves in what had been a chaotic first half. And it was goal number 70 in 90 Champions League games that left him level with Cristiano Ronaldo and one short of Raul's record.

Messi turned provider on the hour sliding a pass through for Suarez. It should have been his first goal for Barca. His first touch took him clear of the Ajax defence but Cillessen won the one-on-one and so there was no 'no-celebration' from the Uruguayan who had promised to respect his former supporters.

Arkadiusz Milik headed against the post as Ajax pushed for the equalizer but they were reduced to ten men when Joel Veltman was sent off for a second bookable offence and as Barca poured forward wth the extra man Messi got his historic goal.

The result will calm talk of crisis at the Nou Camp. Suarez will hope he gets off the mark soon after another frustrating night in front of goal.

There were at least signs in the second half when he played more centrally and Messi tucked in behind him that things are beginning to click.

Enrique still has problems, with Alves below par at right-back and Pique an unused substitute. But he also has Messi. The Argentine had a quiet first half hour as Barca suffered but when he came alive he killed the game. And at just 27 years of age has leveled with Raul – the only difference being that it has taken him 90 games and not 142 as it did the Spaniard.

'Messi is the best player I have seen in my life' said Enrique after his double. 

He added: 'We were better in the second half. We always tried to win the ball back as far from our goal as possible and we were able to do that better after the break. 

'It's important qualify with two games left. We have to improve we know that much but I have no complaints about the attitude of my players.'
