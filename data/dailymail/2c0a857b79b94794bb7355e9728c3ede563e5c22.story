A polar bear who survived a near fatal injury has defied the odds and is now rearing a second set of cubs.

It was feared the bear, who appeared to have a badly broken leg, would have to be put down when spotted on a barrier island in Bernard Spit, Alaska in 2009.

But five years on, the sow has now been spotted with a second set of cubs showing that her disability is not holding her back.

The new set of pictures were captured by wildlife photographer,  Steve Kazlowski, who has been monitoring the bear since 2009

Wildlife photographer Steve Kazlowski has been monitoring the polar bear over the years, charting her progress.

He said: 'Her new cubs are only a year old and I don't know if her other cubs made it.

'I observed her many times during the eight weeks that I was photographing polar bears last fall.

The two cubs, who follow their mother, are thought to be her second set of cubs. Her first set were first spotted in 2011

It is thought that the new cubs are around one year old with Mr Kazlowski monitoring them over an eight week period

'She was feeding, resting, playing, walking and swimming - doing all the natural things you would expect a polar bear to do.

'I would imagine her chances of survival are pretty good as she has been able to survive with a bad leg and she has her second set of cubs now.

'I was so happy to see that an animal with a disability was able to learn to live and cope with it.

'Not only that she is thriving and bringing up her offspring.

'Every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats.

Mr  Kazlowski said: 'Every female polar bear giving birth is a good thing with all the changes that are going on with their habitats.'

'It shows that she is a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs.'

The bear was first spotted in Alaska in 2009, when she appeared to have a badly broken leg, which was causing her to walk more slowly.

It was thought at the time that she would be unable to survive but remarkably the animal has learned to deal with her disability.

In 2011, just two years after her life-threatening injury, she showed up with her first set of cubs.

Photographer Mr Kozlowski is now interested to see if the bears show up on Bernard Spit again next year

Mr Kazlowski added: 'We knew it was the same bear because she's the only one who shows with the same break in the same spot.

'The first couple of years she walked softly on it but has now figured out how to move efficiently with it.

'The leg has calloused over internally so it hangs and dangles - it will remain that way for the rest of her life.

'She moves fine and seems to have more confidence and now has another litter of cubs. She just showed up along the coast again and I saw her. She is hard to miss with that leg.

'It will be interesting to see if she shows up next fall.'

Mr Kazlowski believes that the female polar bear is a 'a very smart mother and is raising intelligent cubs'.

But she has learned to deal with the impairment even though her leg hangs and dangles over
