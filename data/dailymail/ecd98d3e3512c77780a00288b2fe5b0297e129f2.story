A peeping tom has unwittingly revealed his identity after he allegedly set up cameras to record female roommates undressing in their bedrooms and using the toilet.

Michael Stephen McKenny, 42, was arrested on Thursday after the women found the cameras in their home and police viewed the footage - where he appears to be seen angling the lens.

McKenny had watched the women at their shared condo in Ellicott City, Maryland for four months, police said.

Unwitting: Michael Stephen McKenny, 42, was allegedly captured on his own camera which he set up in two women's apartment in Ellicott City, Maryland

Fright: Michael Stephen McKenny, 42, was arrested and faces up to 40 years in jail after reportedly gaining access to the apartment and setting up cameras in bathrooms and bedrooms

Police said McKenny used to reposition the lens several times a day and even wiped down the area around the camera to make sure there were no footprints.

He knew both women and allegedly stole a set of keys, had them copied and then returned them without the pair noticing.

Police have refused to reveal further details about his relationship to the women to protect their identities.

The 42-year-old has been charged with multiple counts of burglary and video surveillance, Sherry Llewellyn, from Howard County Police Department, told MailOnline.Â 

McKenny has not yet entered a plea but is being held on $100,000 bond and could face up to 40 years in prison.

Creepy: The man allegedly checked the cameras several times a day and wiped the area clean of footprints

Adjustments: The cameras were angled so that they captured the women using the bathroom and undressing, according to police
