Mikael Lustig has rubbed salt in Rangers’ wounds by insisting they are currently no match for Aberdeen or Dundee United — let alone Celtic.

Ronny Deila’s side eased to a League Cup Final showdown with United on March 15 after comfortably seeing off the Ibrox men 2-0 on Sunday.

In what was widely regarded as the most one-sided derby in history, the Premiership leaders progressed to the showpiece without the need for Craig Gordon to make a meaningful save.

Mikael Lustig says that Rangers deserve to be in the Scottish Premiership but aren't better than many teams

Given Rangers’ Championship status, Lustig acknowledged he and his Celtic colleagues were only doing what was expected of them.

He believes that if their greatest rivals claim a Premiership place in time for next season, they will struggle to usurp the teams currently sitting second and fourth in the table, either side of Inverness Caley Thistle.

‘Rangers should be in the Premiership because they still have some decent players,’ said the Swede.

‘But I think, right now, Aberdeen and Dundee United are better teams.’

Asked if he was surprised at Celtic’s domination of their old foes, Lustig replied: ‘Not really. Obviously, we should be better. I think the first goal was really important and, once we went 2-0 up, that was it.

‘They stayed with the same tactics and dropped back. We still managed to find spaces between their back four, though.

‘In the first 10 minutes, we started with a really good tempo. We were speaking with each other during the whole game to stay focused. We knew if they scored and made it 2-1, it could have been different — but I felt really comfortable.

‘They maybe had one shot or cross that was a bit dangerous, but that was it. We made it difficult for Rangers and we wanted to score more goals, but you also don’t want to concede anything.’

Victory in the first derby in three years was just the first assignment of a defining period for Celtic.

A trip to Dens Park in the Scottish Cup awaits on Saturday, with home and away clashes against Inter Milan in the Europa League the tasty appetisers for a Premiership clash with Aberdeen at Celtic Park on March 1.

‘February is a big month for us,’ Lustig added. ‘We are in the League Cup Final and still in every competition. We just need to be ready.

‘We have been strong recently and not conceded many goals. If we are strong defensively, we will be good in attack, too. We are looking better every week.

‘We will get asked questions because Aberdeen have been winning, but we have to focus on our game. If we play to the level we know we can, we should be able to beat teams.’

Even before Leigh Griffiths’ header laid the foundations for the most perfunctory of wins, it was apparent Kenny McDowall’s chances of semi-final success were about as high as the man who seeks to scoop the lottery without first buying a ticket.

Shorn of quality, the Rangers caretaker manager had little option but to load his midfield, sit deep and limit the space in which Celtic’s fleet-footed front four could operate.

The pay-off was that veteran Kenny Miller spent much of the game operating in a different postcode from his team-mates.

His withdrawal to a deeper role at the interval, with substitute Jon Daly thrown further forward, proved about as threatening as a pop gun.

Celtic keeper Craig Gordon could have kept goal in his dinner suit without so much as a thought for dry cleaning.

‘Rangers played how we thought they might, trying to get men behind the ball and looking to hit us on the counter-attacks with a more direct ball,’ said Gordon. ‘They were just looking for one of them to fall kindly. It doesn’t take a great deal of luck for that to work, a misplaced header or whatever it might be, and they have a chance. But it didn’t work out for them.

‘We dealt with it fairly well and read whatever they tried.

‘When Jon Daly came on, he made things a bit more difficult, winning a few more balls. But we managed to read the flick-ons and not give them any chances.’

Down the years, Celtic’s goalkeepers have had to become familiar with long periods of inactivity on those occasions where the front line are engaged with putting cannon fodder to the sword. In such circumstances, complacency can creep in.

‘I made sure I kept my concentration,’ added Gordon, now a veteran of the Edinburgh, Tyne-Wear and Glasgow derbies.

‘From the start, I was looking to dominate my box and come to take any balls coming in. I knew that if we gave away free-kicks, they would be looking to put us under pressure.

‘That was my mindset — to be aggressive, come for crosses and aim to take the pressure off us.

‘We were comfortable in the game. It was about us controlling what we could and trying to play football on what was a difficult surface.’
