He may not have played since the FA Cup defeat by Leicester on January 24 but Emmanuel Adebayor does not appear to be giving up his Tottenham career easily.

The out-of-favour striker took to Instagram on Monday to post a cryptic message, perhaps making reference to his current situation under manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Alongside a picture of himself sitting in a car, the former Arsenal man wrote: 'When life puts you in tough situations. Don't say 'why me'. Just say 'try me'.'

Adebayor has made just 11 Premier League appearances for Tottenham so far this season

Adebayor came close to joining West Ham on loan in the January transfer window and he has found it difficult to break into Mauricio Pochettino's starting XI this year.

His last Premier League appearance came as a substitute against Sunderland on January 17 and he has just two top-flight goals to his name this season.

Younes Kaboul and Etienne Capoue have also struggled for playing time in 2015 but Pochettino has refused to confirm whether the trio will leave White Hart Lane this summer.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has demoted Adebayor to the club's third-choice striker in recent months

Speaking about squad selection ahead of his side's 2-1 win at QPR on Saturday, the former Southampton boss said: 'Always for every game it's my decision, my choice.

'I think that you understand. In the end, all of our squad is fully fit and you need to pick players.

'I am happy with all, but if we have 26 or 27 players in the squad then more than 18 is impossible.'
