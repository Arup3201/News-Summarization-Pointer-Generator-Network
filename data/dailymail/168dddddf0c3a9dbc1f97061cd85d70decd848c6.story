Real Madrid's latest teen sensation Martin Odegaard has revealed that his move to the La Liga giants was not driven by money.

Speaking during a farewell news conference in Norway organized by his former club Stromsgodset, Odegaard thanked his old employers for a 'great adventure'.

The 16-year-old - who signed a contract worth a staggering £40,000-a-week basic wage with Real last week - said his decision was made purely for 'sporting' reasons.

'It [money] has not been an issue at all for me. It was not an issue in my discussions with various clubs,' he said. 'I chose what was best for me in sporting terms.'

Having visited a number of Premier League sides before deciding to switch to the Bernabeu, Odegaard is set to start his Real Madrid career in the reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla, coached by legend Zinedine Zidane.

'It was a process where I visited several clubs, which was reported. A decision was made after that,' he added. 

'[Zidane is] one of the world's best footballers of all time.'

Odegaard admitted the chance of working under Zinedine Zidane influenced his decision to join Real
