British tennis star Laura Robson has been at Wimbledon larking around with French Open winner Maria Sharapova – with not a tennis ball in sight.

The 20-year-old visited her friend at Sharapova’s first pop-up sweet store Sugarpova, which is open in Wimbledon Village until the tournament finishes on July 6.

The Sugarpova lounge has an array of sweets and candy, a juice bar with flavours inspired by Sharapova, and a photo booth for people to commemorate their visit.

Robson tweeted a picture of her laughing alongside Sharapova in the photo booth.

The Britain No 1 had minor surgery on her wrist in April that ruled her out of last month’s French Open and means she will not take part at Wimbledon on home soil.

Sharapova, meanwhile, is looking to improve on her performance at SW19 last year, where she was knocked out in the second round.
