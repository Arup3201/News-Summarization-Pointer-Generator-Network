Ryan Giggs will take charge of Manchester United when the players return for pre-season training on Monday.

Giggs – who was announced as Louis van Gaal’s No 2 – will be assisted by Dutchman Albert Stuivenberg who has just been added to the new look backroom team.

New United boss Van Gaal is still in Brazil preparing for Holland’s World Cup semi-final with Argentina and will leave the early training sessions to Giggs, who took charge the final four games of last season following David Moyes’ sacking.

Stuivenberg has worked with Van Gaal as Holland Under 21 boss and he has recommended many youngsters who have since moved up to the senior team.

The 53-year-old will be expected to help the youngsters develop at United and be Van Gaal's eyes and ears on the training pitch.

Van Gaal has already brought in Frans Hoek and Marcel Bout at Old Trafford as he continues to re-mould the set-up.

The Dutchman will officially takeover at United once Holland's World Cup involvement is over.

United’s players who did not feature at the World Cup will return to the Aon Training Complex in Carrington for the start of pre-season training.

The likes of Jonny Evans, Darren Fletcher and Ashley Young will all report for training along with Wilfried Zaha and Nick Powell who were sent out on loan last season.

Players such as Wayne Rooney, Antonio Valencia and Javier Hernandez, who all featured at the World Cup, will be giving extra time off.

United travel to America at the end of this month to play a number of high-profile friendlies against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid.

They hope to have Van Gaal in charge by this time.
