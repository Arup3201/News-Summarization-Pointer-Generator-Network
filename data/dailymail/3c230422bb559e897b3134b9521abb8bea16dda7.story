Caught: Celestino Moras, 25, was lassoed by a cowboy during a rodeo after he started firing into a crowd

A drunk man who started firing his gun into a crowd at a rodeo was arrested after a cowboy lassoed him.

Celestino Moras, 25, wounded three people during the shooting spree at a Memorial Day Weekend church picinic in Cartersville, Bartow County, Georgia.

Around 300 guests started fleeing, but Moras was stopped when a bystander threw a rope over his head when he ran out of bullets, according to WSBTV-2.

Other guests then attacked him and tied him up until officers arrived at the scene.

Before he was arrested, he was treated for facial injuries by doctors.

After being taken to Bartow County Jail, he was charged with aggravated assault and placed in custody.

A fourth person was knifed in the hand by a second suspect, who is still being hunted by police.

According to people at the event, Moras had not been invited and many people did not know who he was.

But he got angry when partygoers asked him to leave.

The Garcia family, who live right next door, heard the gun shots. 

The father, Ronaldo Garcia, told his children to get back inside the house after hearing shots.

Isai Garcia told the station: 'My dad said we had to move in the house.

'He said, we've got to come back inside. 

'He just wanted to know of there were any people over there with a gun.'

The four wounded escaped with only minor injuries and were released from hospital after treatment.

Neighbours also described how police were looking for another man in connection with the shooting, who was said to have been wearing a cowboy hat at the time.

In custody: Moras was charged with aggravated assault and was booked into Bartow County Jail
