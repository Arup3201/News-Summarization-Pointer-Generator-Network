Usually a portrait of a little girl might involve a cute dress and a hair bow, but these parents have gone for a quirkier look for the mantlepiece.

Their children are dressed as Mother Teresa, 
Freda Kahlo and astronaut Ellen Ochoa. They  form part of a photography project
 with a worthy mission -- to encourage the next generation of women to 
value more than just their looks by posing as women
 who have changed history

The initiative, known as the Isis 
Project, is the brainchild of photographer Kat Carey and marketing 
manager Cassandra Yerdeni from San Antonio in Texas.

‘We want to empower girls to emulate women who’ve made a contribution to society,’ explains 27-year-old co-founder Cassandra, mother to two-year-old Lily.

The iconic women picked for the project include Michelle Obama, Freda Khalo, Mother Teresa, Maya Angelou, and Queen Elizabeth.

‘Girls
 deserve to feel good about themselves and know that showing some skin 
or being “pretty” is not that the only way to be rewarded,’ says Kat, 
who is the project’s photographer.

‘There
 is nothing wrong with owning your own sexuality or being good-looking, 
but women should be praised for more than that,' she tells MailOnline.

‘We should be praised for our talent, minds, skills, heart and strengths.

‘We want this project to be a form of education -- opening up new role models and great women to look up to,' she adds.

The pair hold monthly sessions in their studio in San Antonio and named the series of images the Isis Project, after the Egyptian goddess of rebirth, a symbol of strong femininity.

As a single parent, Cassandra says she strives to surround her two-year-old daughter Lily with courageous and passionate role models, and to instill in her a feeling of pride in her femininity.

‘Through the Isis Project, I hope to recognise the achievements of women throughout history, in a variety of fields, and to inspire girls just like Lily to fly with their own wings,’ she says.

Kat, who lives with her husband, Mike, and daughter Sofia, two (pictured here styled as Annie Leibovitz) is equally passionate.

‘We want to achieve so much,’ says the 29-year-old, ‘But at the same time we would honestly happy to achieve as little as empowering one girl to know that her worth is not measured but her looks.’

So how did the creative duo come up with the idea? ‘We were inspired by Austin-based photographer, Jaime Moore’s “Not Just A Girl”, which is collection of five photos of her pre-school aged daughter dressed as real-life female heroines,’ Kat recalls.

‘We both saw it and thought, “We should do this with our daughters.” Then Cassandra said, “We should do this with the entire city!”’

The Isis Project, invites all girls, from babies to 18-year-olds, to participate and pose as a trailblazer.

The parents and girls decide which heroine they’d like to copy, and so far Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama have proven the most popular role models.

Once the project has turned one later this year, the creative duo intend to exhibit their images to spread their message of substance over sexiness.
