A Welsh politician has picked a fight with Oxford University by asking for the return of one of Wales' oldest treasures.

The university is currently the custodian of a 33,000-year-old skeleton that received the oldest ceremonial burial in Western Europe.

But Byron Davies, the Assembly Member for South Wales, has asked the university to return the remains of the person known as the Red Lady of Paviland, who was buried in Gower, Wales.

The 'Red Lady of Paviland' was discovered in a limestone cave in Gower in 1823 by a geology professor at the Oxford University, where it is kept. Here, Museum Assistant Lisa Roberts is pictured with the remains when they were on show at the National Museum and Galleries of Wales in Cardiff

The skeleton, which is actually that of a man, got its name as it was dyed in red ochre, giving its bones the unusual colour.

It was discovered in a limestone cave in Gower in 1823 by a geology professor at the university, which is why the skeleton has been under lock and key in Oxford ever since.

It is still the oldest ceremonial burial of a human discovered in Western Europe.

Oxford University said the skeleton is one of the iconic relics of the British Palaeolithic, and a cast of the skeleton is on permanent display, along with related artefacts, at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.

The bones were thought to be a woman's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to Roman times by the professor when they were found (reconstruction of Paviland burial pictured)

Welsh politician Byron Davies wants the skeleton to be returned to Wales, where it was found. The skeleton was unearthed in Gower, south Wales

The bones were thought to be a woman's because of jewellery found nearby and were wrongly dated to Roman times by the professor when they were found.

Mr Davies believes the skeleton ‘belongs to Gower’ and said: ‘It would be good to have it back where it belongs. It adds to the bigger picture of bringing people to the city and to the Gower.’

‘I understand the University of Oxford is not in favour of releasing it, so there would have to be some negotiation.’

The skeleton was found during at Goat's Hole Cave - one of the limestone caves between Port Eynon and Rhossili, on the Gower Peninsula, south Wales

Mr Davies believes the skeleton should be on display.

‘But the university has it at the moment and it is not on display with them, which I think is wrong,’ he said.

He is ‘serious’ about raising funds to 
ensure the remains could be kept safe in Swansea, close to where they 
found and the Red Lady of Peviland was laid to rest.

Mr Davies said: ‘I have yet to take the next step which would be to make some sort of contact with the university, to talk to them nicely about it and try to be reasonable.

‘They did lend the original bones to the Museum of Wales in, I think, 2009,’ he added.

The politician said Swansea Museum if keen to look after the Red Lady, but noted that the outcome is ‘up to the university’.

‘I have a fairly persuasive tongue in me. I hope I've a chance,’ he said.

This week, UK Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who was brought up in Bridgend, spoke with Mr Davies about getting the bones back.

‘When she came down she was quite fascinated by the story and agreed it should be on display in Swansea,’ Mr Davies said.

However, a spokesman from Oxford University said the skeleton is ‘held securely in a collections room inside the museum and is available for researchers and guided tours’.’

‘Neither the Museum nor the University of Oxford has been formally approached with a request to discuss repatriation of the ‘Red Lady’ material, so the question of whether the ‘Red Lady’ should be repatriated to a permanent home in Wales is not currently under consideration.'

'The University of Oxford does have a policy on repatriation and any decision would be made by the University’s Council (its governing body) following advice received from those responsible for the collection of which this item is a part,' he said.

A cast is on display in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and in 2014 the bones will go on display at London's Natural History Museum.
