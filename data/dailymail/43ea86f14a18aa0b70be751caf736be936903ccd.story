Max Schireson was tired of being asked what type of car he drives.

As the male CEO of a billion dollar company and a married father-of-three, he would listen as his female counterparts were questioned on how they maintain a healthy work and family balance, wondering why the same was never asked of him.

He was also tired of spending more time on planes flying around the world on business than he was with his wife and kids.

So on Wednesday Schireson - who fronts fast-growing New York database company MongoDB, which has grown $220 million in the last four years under his leadership - announced he was stepping down from the 'best job in the world' in order to have more time at home.

'This is the right choice': Max Schireson, CEO of emerging database software company MongoDB, has announced he has stepped down from the demands of his role in order to have more time with his 'beautiful family'

'Life is about choices. Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so,' Schireson wrote on his blog.

'At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice.'

Business Insider noted that MongoDB was last valued at $1 billion but is developing quickly and considered 'one of the most important tech companies in New York'.

The software the company offers is used as a backend by the likes of Craiglist and eBay.

As CEO, Schireson stood to become 'phenomenally wealthy' if he had stayed seen out the expected trajectory.

But Schireson - whose family are based in California - had more important plans.

'I have three wonderful kids at home, aged 14, 12 and 9, and I love spending time with them: skiing, cooking, playing backgammon, swimming, watching movies or Warriors or Giants games, talking, whatever,' Schireson wrote on his blog.

'I have an amazing wife who also has an important career: she is a doctor and professor at Stanford where, in addition to her clinical duties, she runs their training program for high risk obstetricians and conducts research on on prematurity, surgical techniques, and other topics.

'She is a fantastic mom, brilliant, beautiful, and infinitely patient with me.

'I love her, I am forever in her debt for finding a way to keep the family working despite my crazy travel.

'I should not continue abusing that patience.'

Successful: Schireson said that MongoDB grew by $220 million in the four years he was CEO. The company started in 2007

He will move into the role of vice chairman at MongoDB from September 3.

Schireson will be replaced

Admirably, Schireson said MongoDB needs a leader that is 'all in' and that is why he is relinquishing his role.

Additionally, he is fatalistic about the jobs that such a decision - and making that decision public - will cost him in years to come.

'I recognize that by writing this I may be disqualifying myself from some future CEO role,' he wrote online.

'Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday? Maybe.'

Schireson told Forbes that the decision came to him on an overnight flight to Austin.

He commutes from New York to Palo Alto, California, every two to three weeks which, along with other travel, would tally his flyer miles at over 300,000 per year.

His flight had to make an emergency landing Tucson, but, exhausted, he slept through it.

He woke to see some crew members were traumatized by the emergency and had to be replaced by other staff.

'In that moment, I realized, ''What am I doing?"' he told the magazine.

Earlier this summer, Matt Lauer asked Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, whether she could balance the demands of being a mom and being a CEO.

The Atlantic asked similar questions of PepsiCo’s female CEO Indra Nooyi. As a male CEO, I have been asked what kind of car I drive and what type of music I like, but never how I balance the demands of being both a dad and a CEO.

While the press haven’t asked me, it is a question that I often ask myself. Here is my situation:

Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood.

Somehow, the same people don’t ask me.

A few months ago, I decided the only way to balance was by stepping back from my job.

MongoDB is a special company. In my nearly 4 years at the company, we have raised $220 million, grown the team 15x and grown sales 30x.

We have amazing customers, a great product which gets better with every release, the strongest team I have ever worked with, and incredible momentum in the market.

The future is bright and MongoDB deserves a leader who can be “all-in” and make the most of the opportunity.

Unfortunately, I cannot be that leader given the geography of the majority of the company in New York and my family in California.

I recognize that by writing this I may be disqualifying myself from some future CEO role.

Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday?

Maybe. Life is about choices.

Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so.

At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice.

In one month, I will hand the CEO role to an incredibly capable leader in Dev Ittycheria.

He will have the task of leading the company through its next phase of growth (though thankfully not of commuting across the country while doing it!).

I know the company will be in great hands; his skills fit our next phase of growth better than mine do. And I will be there to help (full time, but 'normal full time' and not 'crazy full time') in whatever areas he needs help.

More about the announcement can be found in today’s press release.

I hope I will be able to find a way to craft a role at MongoDB which is engaging, impactful, and compatible with the most important responsibilities in my life.

As great as this job has been, I look forward to creating one which is even better.
