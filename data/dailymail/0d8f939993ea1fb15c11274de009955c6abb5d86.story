A paediatrician who worked in the hospital at the centre of the Jimmy Savile scandal has been found guilty of a series of rapes and sexual assaults against seriously ill young girls. 

Dr Michael Salmon, now 80, was today convicted of nine indecent assaults and two rapes carried out against six girls aged 11 to 18, between 1973 and 1988.

Reading Crown Court heard that he raped one girl at his home after she went to him aged 16 for treatment, telling her 'one good turn deserves another.'

The jury was also told he carried out assaults in his consulting room at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, while the girls' parents waited just yards away behind a screen.

The prosecution told how he fondled girls' breasts while claiming to check for cancer, and carried out intimate examinations  without gloves after patients came to him complaining of migraines.

He was also found guilty of two rapes at his home when a 16-year-old he had seen regularly for stomach problems came to him asking for an abortion after fearing she was pregnant.

The court was previously told that after administering a painful procedure to get rid of the child he then held her down and raped her while she cried and screamed in pain.

The victim recalled feeling 'dizzy' and 'light-headed' as she was asked to lie back on the bed for a check-up. Salmon then told her 'one good turn deserves another' before attacking her.

'I don't remember much - I just closed my eyes until it was over,' she told the court.

 'I couldn't take in what he meant and then he dropped his trousers and I see he has got nothing on apart from his shirt and he's coming towards me, he's on me,' she said, her voice breaking as she told how she screamed, 'No.'

After the attack he dropped her at a bus stop where she caught a bus home and bled on her white summer dress during the journey.

He then raped the same girl a second time after telling her to come back because she may have been pregnant with twins.

Salmon was jailed and struck off the medical register in 1991 (pictured) after admitting three counts of indecent assault against young female patients

The jury found him guilty of both rapes, but found him not guilty of using an instrument to procure and abortion. 

He was acquitted of one further count of rape against one victim, and two indecent assaults against a further teenager.

The abuse concerned the time Salmon was a leading paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, with much of it taking place within the hospital itself.

Allegations of sex assaults carried out by another doctor at the hospital were also recently investigated by Thames Valley Police until it was discovered he had died.

An NHS report into historic abuse carried out at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in light of the Savile allegations was delayed last year to gather new evidence and has yet to be published.

The jury of seven men and five women had heard how Salmon would examine young girls in a consulting room, when their parents were placed behind a screen or asked to leave the room.

He would touch teenage girls' breasts, with one woman speaking of being shown how to check herself for breast cancer, and another saying Salmon 'squeezed' her nipples.

Other patients said he subjected them to unnecessary vaginal examinations when they went to him for treatment for conditions like migraines.

One patient recalled being asked to do balancing exercises with her top off before being subjected to an unnecessary intimate examination. 

Salmon had already been struck off the medical register after he admitted three counts of indecent assault against young female patients in 1991.

He was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree for offences at the hospital when eight women came forward in the wake of the Savile scandal.

Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, said there is 'no suggestion that this defendant abused a young female patient in concert with Jimmy Savile'.

'It’s simply that these allegations relate to a time when the other things were happening.'

Prolific child abuser Savile is believed to have carried out his worst offending at the hospital, where he had his own office with the Jimmy Savile Stoke Mandeville Hospital Trust charity in 1981.

The court previously heard how Salmon thought he was 'bomb-proof' because no one would believe a child over him.

During a police interview after he was arrested in 2013, Salmon described his victims as 'gold-diggers' and fantasists.

He said: 'As we know, teenagers are unreliable witnesses, their sexual fantasies often take over, become reality and I think you better explore that. This is nothing to do with... I've never done that.'

Defending Salmon, barrister Sarah Jones previously said he had been 'hauled over coals,' just as he was rebuilding his life.

She said: 'He's become a scapegoat for a time when too many people died before the winds of change blew.'

But Ms Moore said: 'This isn't a quick fumble in a car park, this is a concerted and repeated attacks on young women. He appears to have a total lack of understanding that what he did was wrong.

Miranda Moore QC, prosecuting, said there was no suggestion that Salmon had abused patients with Savile, but the offences had occurred around the same time

'In his view, it's incredibly silly. His own behaviour indicates a total lack of moral compass.'

She added: 'This is a case about trust. That trust is left in the hands of medical professionals every day. These girls weren't just ill with a snuffle or a cut knee, these girls were really ill. 

'They were vulnerable, young, entrusted and trusting. That's what gave him opportunity. That trust was breached by Mr Salmon.'

Dressed in a smart navy suit with a blue pocket handkerchief,  Salmon showed no emotion as he listened to the verdicts being read out.

Adrian Foster, chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Thames and Chiltern said: 'Michael Salmon has been convicted today of offences which are particularly shocking due to the abuse of his position as a doctor taking advantage of the female patients in his care.

'His crimes were extremely traumatic for his victims, who should have expected his support rather than this gross betrayal of their trust.

'Michael Salmon used his status to molest these vulnerable young girls and women who felt unable to complain as he was a doctor, and many of whom only bravely came forward after seeing other cases in the media.

'I hope they now feel that justice has been done.'

Detective Sergeant Malcolm Wheeler, from the child abuse investigation unit at Thames Valley Police, said: 'Salmon was a prolific sexual offender who abused his position of power in order for his own sexual gratification.

'As a consultant paediatrician, he preyed on young girls who had been referred to him for a variety of health issues.

'They trusted him, they believed him, because he was a doctor and they thought he was trustworthy.

'On a number of occasions, he carried out unnecessary internal examinations on young girls.

'Although they felt uncomfortable at this, they didn't feel able to tell anyone because they believed the examinations must have been necessary.

'Some of the offences were committed while the child's parent was just outside the room.'

He added that he has 'no further concerns' about hospitals in Buckinghamshire but added more women have come forward with historic allegations against Salmon since the beginning of the trial.

Salmon has been remanded in custody to await sentencing next week.
