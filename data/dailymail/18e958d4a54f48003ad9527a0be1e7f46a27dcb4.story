Health risk: Painkillers used by millions of Britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke (file picture)

Painkillers used by millions of Britons have been linked to higher risk of irregular heartbeat that could trigger a stroke.

The extra chance of developing atrial fibrillation is as high as 84 per cent, Dutch researchers say.

The condition – a leading cause of first-time strokes – means the upper chambers of the heart are out of rhythm and beat much faster than normal, which allows blood to pool and clot.

At least seven million Britons with arthritis take prescription painkillers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac and ibuprofen, and newer medication called coxibs.

In the study, the heart health of 8,423 people aged 55 and older was tracked since 1990 in Rotterdam.

Cases of atrial fibrillation were diagnosed using heart tracer recordings, while the details of drugs prescribed were gathered from pharmacies.

The average age of the study participants was 68, and just over half were women, says a report in the online journal BMJ Open.

During the average monitoring period of just under 13 years, 857 participants developed atrial fibrillation. Of these 261 had never used NSAIDs when they were diagnosed, while 554 had used NSAIDs in the past, and 42 were currently taking these drugs.

Current use was associated with a 76 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation than for those who had never taken NSAIDs. Age, sex and underlying heart problems were taken into account.

Use of the painkillers within the preceding 30 days was linked to an 84 per cent greater risk of atrial fibrillation. While there was a trend for higher doses to be linked to higher atrial fibrillation risk, the finding was not statistically significant.

It is thought NSAIDs may contribute to heart rhythm problems by increasing blood pressure as a result of fluid retention.

Bruno Stricker, of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, said previous research had thrown up a link between atrial fibrillation and these painkillers.

‘Our results also suggest that the increased risk occurs shortly after starting treatment and may disappear over time,’ he added. 

NSAIDs work by blocking the COX-2 enzyme which reduces pain and inflammation, but is also important in regulating heart function.

There were 17million prescriptions for NSAIDs in the UK in 2010. Ibuprofen can be bought from pharmacists and supermarkets, along with Voltarol tablets containing diclofenac but at far lower doses than on prescription. 

Around ten years ago the anti-arthritis drug Vioxx was voluntarily taken off the market because of an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Professor Colin Baigent, of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at Oxford University, said: ‘This study is consistent with previous reports indicating that some NSAIDs increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.

‘Atrial fibrillation is just one of several cardiac hazards associated with NSAIDs, the most important of which is an increased risk of heart attacks.

‘Although NSAIDs are very effective for 
the treatment of pain, it is important that both risks and benefits are 
considered carefully before they are prescribed.’

Oxford researchers last year found that high doses of NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart failure.

Their study confirmed the existence of a ‘small but significant’ extra risk of dying from heart problems after prolonged use.

The research, published in The Lancet medical journal, found naproxen was the safest NSAID.

Researchers looked at the highest doses of painkillers prescribed by doctors, twice the daily amount recommended for headache and other minor ailments.

They said a short course of tablets bought over the counter for a muscle sprain was unlikely to be hazardous.

The study pooled the findings from 639 trials after numerous small trials showed a link between NSAIDs and heart side effects.
