Drones aren't the obvious way to give diners a romantic treat but one restaurant is hoping a flying machine laden with mistletoe will do the trick - and bring festive bookings flooding in.

TGI Fridays launched the drone after research revealed that 47 per cent of Britons have never enjoyed a kiss under the mistletoe. 

The study also found that just 27 percent of people were planning to lock lips with someone under the festive plant this year - something the restaurant hopes to change.

The drone, which can fly at speeds of up to 35mph, has been trialled at chain's Manchester Royal Exchange outlet, where it hovered 8ft above couples.

Despite Britons' reluctance to lock lips beneath the mistletoe, 42 per cent of people said that Christmas is one of the most romantic times of year.

Four in 10 say that the office Christmas party is the best place to find festive romance, with one in 10 admitting to kissing their boss. 

Not every Christmas fling ended in embarrassment however, with four per cent saying they went on to marry their colleague.

Looks like it's working! Two couples indulge in a quick PDA as the mistletoe flies overhead  

'Everyone loves a good Christmas party, but we all know things can be a bit awkward until someone breaks the ice,' said TGI Fridays marketing manager Rachel Waller of the drone's uses.

'We wanted to see how we could make Christmas get-together in our restaurants even more entertaining.

'We offered guests the encouragement they need to make their move - particularly the one half of UK adults who have never had a kiss under the mistletoe.

'Our mistletoe drones are the perfect way to do this. Not only are they great fun for the entire restaurant, but they help people get a little closer at this romantic time of the year.

'Maybe we'll have had our first mistletoe drone wedding by this time next year.' 

The drone weighed only 1kg and flew over dinners heads with a piece of mistletoe attached to the bottom of it

The survey, which was conducted by TGI Fridays and spoke to more than 2000 people, also looked which professions are most likely to get involved in a romantic incident at a Christmas party.

63 per cent of those working in hospitality said they would kiss a colleague, with the property industry coming a close second at 62 percent and those in the media not far behind at 56 per cent.

But if you don't fancy kissing Pete from accounts this year you're not alone. The research also unearthed the male celebrities we'd most like to kiss this Christmas.

Hollywood superstar George Clooney, 53, former footballer David Beckham, 39, and actor Brad Pitt, 50, all came up trumps.

Meanwhile, model Kelly Brook, 34, actress Scarlett Johansson, 29, and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 31, are the celebrities men want to kiss the most. 

The flying drone has a HD camera which can film for up to 20 minutes: Plenty of time to catch the dinners kissing!
