It is nearly four decades since the British people were last given the chance to have their say on Europe, in the first ever referendum held throughout the UK.

And now that David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on the EU by 2017, the parallels between the first European vote and the one potentially looming are striking.

In the mid 1970s, Britain was slipping behind its European neighbours, as the government struggled to deal with runaway inflation and was forced to introduce a three-day working week due to severe electricity shortages.

Europhile Conservative Prime Minister
Ted Heath firmly believed that the way to rescue the UK from its economic slump was to join 
the European Economic Community.

The decision to sign up in 1973 came 
after 300 hours of bruising debate in Parliament, and in the end passed 
by just eight votes.

Labour came to power the following year with a manifesto which promised to offer a referendum on whether or not to stay in the EEC.

The position of the new Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was similar to that set out by Mr Cameron today - he pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership, then campaign for an 'in' vote in the referendum.

However, in a contrast to the current situation, most of the Eurosceptic opposition at that time came not from the Right but from the Left, led by firebrand MP Tony Benn.

The referendum was officially called in April 1975, with the date set for June 5 that year - despite many MPs arguing that a public vote would violate the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.

Despite the brief campaigning period of just two months, the argument was fierce and divisive - but this time, it was Labour rather than the Conservatives which was torn apart by disagreements on Europe.

The party chose to remain officially neutral, due to the split between the pro-EEC leadership and the overwhelmingly Eurosceptic membership.

Unusually, members of the Cabinet were allowed to campaign against each other, with left-wing ministers facing off against their more moderate colleagues.

As well as Benn, future Labour leader Michael Foot and pioneering veteran Barbara Castle found themselves ranged against the likes of Home Secretary Roy Jenkins and James Callaghan, who became Prime Minister on Wilson's resignation the next year.

Margaret Thatcher, recently elected leader of the Tories, argued for staying in the EEC, as did most of her party as well as the Liberals.

Count: Volunteers tallying ballot papers in Earls Court after the referendum on June 5, 1975

England: 68.7% for, 31.3% against

Scotland: 58.4% for, 41.6% against

Wales: 64.8% for, 35.1% against

Northern Ireland: 52.1% for, 47.9% against

TOTAL: 67.2% (17,378,581) for, 32.8% (8,470,073) against; turnout 64.5%

The 'yes' campaign was 
supported and funded by big business, anxious to secure access to the 
Common Market which covered all of Western Europe, and to share in the 
economic boom enjoyed by the likes of France and Germany.

It
was strongly opposed by the trade unions, who warned that British jobs 
would be lost if labour markets were opened up, and urged the UK to seek
alternative trading partners outside Europe.

The arguments deployed by both sides were largely to do with the economic effects of close links with Europe - few would have predicted that the EEC would grow into today's European Union, with wide-ranging powers to make laws for member states.

The question on the ballot paper on June 5 read: 'Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?'

The eventual result was a landslide for the 'yes' campaign, with 67.2 per cent of the public voting to stay in the Community.

Every single council area saw a majority in support of the EEC, with the exception of Shetland and the Western Isles.

The UK therefore remained in the EEC, which had its origins in the Treaty of Paris in 1951 establishing the European Coal and Steel Community involving West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

By the 1970s, when Britain joined alongside Denmark and Ireland, the group had expanded to include a customs union and common policies on agriculture and trade, but did not impose regulations within member countries.

The EEC was replaced by the European Union as a result of the Maastricht Treaty, which came into force in 1993 after sparking the first signs of Tory Euroscepticism in Britain, with a huge backbench revolt against John Major's attempt to ratify the agreement.

The EU has now swollen to 27 countries, with Romania and Bulgaria the most recent new additions, and has wide-ranging powers to set laws which must be obeyed by all its members.

In the aftermath of the 1975 result, many observers ascribed the overwhelming result to the deep pockets of the 'yes' campaign and its successful attempts to demonise Eurosceptics as either left-wing extremists, such as Benn and Foot, or xenophobes, such as Enoch Powell.

In the forthcoming EU referendum, the 'yes' campaign, which will be supported by the leaders of all three parties, is likely to take a similar approach by painting those wishing to leave the Union as dogmatic isolationists.

Recent polls have shown the UK closely divided over Europe - a YouGov survey released this week suggested that 40 per cent would vote to stay in the UK while 34 per cent wanted to leave, but a poll in November showed more than half of people wanted to quit the EU.
