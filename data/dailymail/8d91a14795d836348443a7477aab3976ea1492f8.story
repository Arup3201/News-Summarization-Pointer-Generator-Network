A hairdresser was allegedly talking on the phone to her own grandfather when she knocked down and killed a retired couple walking arm in arm during their evening stroll, a court has heard.

Taylor McDonnell, 21, was said to have screamed 'Bampi' down the phone - the name for her grandfather - as she ploughed into Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, in November last year.

The court heard the call to her grandparents was at least the fourth she had made during a 20-minute drive through the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales to visit her boyfriend.

Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, who had been married for 54 years, died after being struck by the vehicle

Retired RAF airman Mr Drew and his former teacher wife, who had Alzheimer's disease, died after being hit by McDonnell's blue Toyota Aygo.

The couple - who were both using walking sticks - had been married for 54 years. 

The 21-year-old, who was wearing slippers at the time, denies being on her phone at the time of the fatal crash and insists she rang her grandparents, Janet and Francis, from a lay-by.

Today, a jury heard evidence from Mr and Mrs McDonnell, who said they had both spoken to their granddaughter during that fateful evening.

Mr McDonnell said: 'My wife received a phone call from Taylor ... and the phone was passed to me.

'I spoke to her about her father ... and his new job. She sounded elated.

'Then the next sentence I heard her screaming "Bampi, Bampi" and then the phone cut off. We tried to ring her back but were unable to get an answer.'

Both Mr and Mrs McDonnell said their granddaughter had not told them she was driving when they took the call and neither heard any significant noise in the background. However, Mr McDonell admitted he has problems with his hearing. 

McDonnell was said to have screamed 'Bampi' down the phone - the name for her grandfather - as she hit the couple, who were both walking along the road with walking sticks 

McDonnell (pictured left outside court, and right) was driving in her slippers and was on her way to visit her boyfriend, the court heard. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' calls while driving

Prosecutor Lucy Crowther told the court: 'McDonnell made a phone call to her grandmother and they had a discussion.

'After the call with her grandmother she spoke with her grandfather.

'He said his granddaughter sounded calm and he couldn't hear any background noise and then suddenly she shouted: "Bampi! Bampi!" and the phone cut off.'

She added: 'They were understandably distraught because they were worried their granddaughter might have been hurt in some sort of accident. So concerned was her grandfather he set out to try and find her.' 

Ms Crowther told the court how the pair had nearly finished their crossing a 30mph road outside a well-lit pub when they were hit by McDonnell at 7.30pm.

'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important,' she said.  

The prosecution said McDonnell (pictured), a hairdresser, admitted speaking on her telephone while driving but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred on November 13, 2013

McDonnell (pictured), of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was said to have run hysterically into a nearby pub and started screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand following the crash, the court heard

Following the collision, the court heard that McDonnell  ran into the nearby Star Inn in a hysterical state.

Witness Debra Ann Bird, who was in the pub with three friends, said: 'This girl ran in screaming "Help me". She looked absolutely devastated and her legs were buckling under her. She was in such a state of shock.'  

Helena Thomas, a long-time friend of the couple, said Mr Drew was a devoted husband and went everywhere with his wife, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

Mrs Thomas recalled one occasion, two years before the tragedy, when Mrs Drew suddenly walked across a pelican crossing as a lorry approached. 

She said: 'Did I have sufficient concern to step out into the road and usher her across quickly? Yes.

'But there was enough time for us to cross. I was concerned like I would have been with any elderly person.'

Yesterday, family and friends of the elderly couple wept as they listened to the heroic efforts of other motorists to comfort the pair after the crash. 

The crash happened on a quiet 30mph road in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales (pictured)

One driver, who found Mrs Drew lying in the verge, covered her with a jacket, gave her basic first aid and 'talked to her and stroked her hair and held her hand' until paramedics arrived, the court was told.

Mr Drew was able to speak to the police officers and ambulance crew as they fought to free him.

'He spent all the time asking about his wife,' said Miss Crowther.  

Mrs Drew was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital but died of her 'massive injuries'  just a few hours later.

Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later.  

Newport Crown Court heard McDonnell admitted speaking on her phone on the night of November 13, 2013, but said she had been using the loudspeaker function at the time of the crash.  

McDonnell denies two counts of causing dangerous driving at Newport Crown Court (pictured above)

Shortly before being arrested McDonnell asked the officer who arrested her, PC Carl Green: 'Why did she walk out in front of me?' and also said a woman hit her windscreen after 'coming from nowhere'.

Previously, the court heard that McDonnell had not realised she had hit Mr Drew until being told by someone else. 

The prosecution alleges that McDonnell was 'grossly distracted' while behind the wheel of her Toyota Aygo on November 13, 2013.

They say the defendant had been on the phone for around 18 minutes of her 20-minute journey and spoke to several different people.  

McDonnell, from Caerwent, Monmouthshire, denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

The case continues.
