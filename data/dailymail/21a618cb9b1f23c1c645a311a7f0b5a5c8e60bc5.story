Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson arrives at the Old Bailey in London today. He has denied claims from a former colleague that he was there when a phone message from Sienna Miller to Daniel Craig was played

Andy Coulson had meetings with four Cabinet ministers on the day he supposedly listened to a hacked voicemail, he told his trial yesterday.

The former News of the World editor insisted his busy diary meant he could not have heard a message in which actress Sienna Miller told James Bond star Daniel Craig: 'I love you'.

Journalist Dan Evans had told the hacking trial he played the message to Coulson in the tabloid's newsroom in London and claimed the editor ordered a cover-up to allow the newspaper to expose the affair without revealing its illegal source.

But Coulson, who later became David Cameron's communications chief, flatly denied hearing the tape and said the newspaper had legitimate sources for the scoop about Miss Miller, who was engaged to the actor Jude Law at the time.

These sources included one of Law's relatives and his film publicist.

He told the jury about the alleged incident in the newspaper offices, in Wapping, east London, saying: 'Andy came over and wanted to hear the tape.

'Certainly Andy was there. I played him the tape a couple of times and listened to it.

'I was over there playing the tape and Andy was standing next to me.'

Evans, 38, has also claimed that Coulson knew about his activities and told him a voicemail he taped from Ms Miller to Mr Craig exposing their alleged affair was 'brilliant'.

Coulson denied ever being aware that convicted hacker Glenn Mulcaire - who had 
been employed by the now-defunct Sunday tabloid - was illegally 
listening in to voicemail messages.

He also hit out at the claim that he had 'bullied' co-defendant and former colleague Clive Goodman.

Coulson, giving evidence for a fourth day in the phone-hacking trial at the Old Bailey, said Evans’ account was wrong.

His counsel, Timothy Langdale QC, asked Coulson: 'Dan Evans told the court that in September 2005 there was an occasion when he played to you a voicemail message left on Daniel Craig’s telephone by Sienna Miller. Did any such incident take place?'

The defendant replied: 'No, it did not.'

The notes of Coulson's PA from September 27, 2005, the day he is accused of listening to the voicemail, show he met with cabinet ministers Alan Milburn, Jack Straw, Charles Clarke, and Tessa Jowell, before listening to Prime Minister Tony Blair's keynote speech.

He then attended a News International party in the evening, after several days of networking at the conference.

'I can remember meeting these people in Brighton', he said. 'I'm pretty sure I went to Blair's speech.'

Journalist Dan Evans also claimed that Coulson knew about his phone hacking activities

Coulson said he could not remember having any specific dealings with Evans - who the tabloid recruited in January 2005 - during their time on the paper, but said they may have spoken.

He told the court: 'I am sure we would have spoken to each other.

'If a new member of staff arrives I would normally make the point of saying hello and having a chat with them.

'I am sure that happened, but none (conversations) stick in my memory.'

Coulson said his personal involvement as editor with stories and the reporters 'varied'.

He said: 'There was no hard and fast set of rules in the way the story was researched and prepared.'

Coulson, 46, of Charing, Kent, is charged with conspiring to hack phones with Rebekah Brooks and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner, and conspiring with former royal editor Clive Goodman to commit misconduct in a public office.

All seven defendants deny all charges against them.

Coulson also said he was aware of three contacts held by journalists on the NotW in relation to Sienna Miller and her then-partner Jude Law.

In an email to Coulson, he is told the paper had 'good inside knowledge' from the 'camp' of Ms Miller's stepmother, Dragon's Den star Kelly Hoppen, and credited Evans with making 'special checks' on the story.

Coulson told the court: 'Good inside stuff from Kelly Hoppen's camp is a clear indication he had got some sources, or a source

'Special checks" doesn't mean anything to me at all, but all reporters think their checks are special.'

Their identities were not disclosed in court, though it has already been reported that a relative of Mr Law had been supplying information about the British actor.

At an earlier hearing the court heard that Law was caught having a fling with nanny Daisy Wright before Miss Miller’s affair with Craig in 2005.

Miss Miller said she had been through a ‘difficult’ time and she turned to Craig, one of her closest 
friends, for comfort.

She 
said: ‘I think the thing that’s been slightly misconstrued about this 
voicemail message is that I said “I love you”... I always ended my phone
 calls with him with “I love you”, just like I did with all my friends 
and family.

‘Whether I was or was not in a relationship with Daniel Craig - it was never a relationship, it was a very brief encounter.

‘He
 was my best friend. Me saying “I love you” – whether anything romantic 
had happened briefly or not – that was always the way I communicated 
with him, whether Jude was present or not.

'It’s been turned into this 
titillating piece of information.’

All three contacts were in the 'Jude Law camp', Coulson said.

He added: 'People in and around celebrities - their relatives, their agents, their PRs - will talk to newspapers.'

He
 said he had asked staff working on the story not to refer to Mr Law as 
either a 'sex addict' or a 'love rat' in copy due to the paper’s 
relationship with sources in his camp.

He said he also believed Mr Law was aware that some of those close to him were talking to the press.

Asked
 by Mr Langdale if there was anything to suggest information contained 
in memos for Coulson by his reporters had been obtained by illegal 
hacking, he replied: 'No, not at all.'

Coulson said the NotW’s front page exclusive about Ms Miller and Mr Craig had come in the same week in 2005 when he had been busy overseeing a serialisation of British boxer Frank Bruno’s biography.

He told the court: 'It was a long, complicated book serialisation. I remember the publishers insisted on making changes quite late in the day, and I think the lawyers were involved as well.

'It took up a lot of my time.'

Responding to suggestions earlier in the trial that he had bullied then-NotW royal editor Goodman by demoting him and reducing his responsibilities, Coulson said: 'I’m not a bully.

'If I made a remark in conference or said something - it’s a newspaper, that happens - I would apologise for it. 

'I did nothing to undermine or attack Clive Goodman.'

Last week, Coulson admitted he had been played hacked voicemails left by Home Secretary David Blunkett for his married lover in 2004.

He said he initially demanded the paper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck cease his investigation into the politician as it was a 'breach of privacy'.

However, Coulson said he reconsidered the story when he heard Mr Blunkett discussing security issues and appearing distracted from his Cabinet role.

Coulson quit as editor of the News of the World in January 2007 after the convictions of Royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking.

Six months later, he was appointed director of communications and planning for the Conservative Party, retaining the post when David Cameron became Prime Minister.

However, he was forced to resign over hacking again in January 2011, as the police investigation got under way.
