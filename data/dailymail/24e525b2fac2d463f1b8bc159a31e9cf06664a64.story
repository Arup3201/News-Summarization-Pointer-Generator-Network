The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States via Mexico has now exceeded 60,0000.

According to Homeland Security figures, the number of young Central Americans who have crossed into the U.S. reached 62,000 at the end of last week.

The flood of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, has caused a humanitarian crisis for the Obama administration.

It's also caused a budget dilemma, with the number of unaccompanied minors likely to reach 90,000, a significant increase on the 38,293 of the previous two years combined. reports CNN.

Housing so many children, some as young as three, has caused overcrowding at federal facilities and now taxpayer-funded private facilities are being used to care for the children pending the determination of their immigration status.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), an arm of the Health and Human Service Department, is responsible for the care of the children after they are apprehended, but with state shelters full, private facilities are receiving millions in taxpayer dollars to take on the overflow.

CBS reports that Southwest Key is one such company. It operates 25 shelters in 15 cities in Texas, Arizona and California that provide legal and medical services as well as schooling.

The ORR aims to resolve a child's immigration status within 45 days.

On Friday, House Republicans managed to pass two bills to force the White House to deal with the child migrant surge more speedily.

The bills would provide emergency funding, faster deportations and rescind President Obama's authority to decide the fate of certain illegal immigrants.

The bills, strongly opposed by the White House and most Democrats, is unlikely to become law, reports the Washington Post.
