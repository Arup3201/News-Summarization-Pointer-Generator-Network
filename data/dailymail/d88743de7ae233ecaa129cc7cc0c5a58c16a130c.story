Police say Connie Villa, 35, forced her kids aged 13, 8, 5 and 3 to swallow prescription narcotics, killing her oldest Aniarael Macias.

Adam Villa first called police Wednesday night to report that his crazed ex-wife Connie had attacked and stabbed him repeatedly in the torso after luring him to her.

Mr.
 Villa arrived after he was lured there by his ex-wife, AZcentral.com

Left
 behind were his three children, the younger surviving children, who 
were at their mother's side as she held a knife to her chest and bled 
from what looked to be self-inflicted stab wounds to her upper torso.

The children appeared unharmed.

Tests later discovered traces of opiates in each of their systems.

Shocking: Connie Villa's ex-husband and father of her youngest three children Adam Villa says he was lured to her home at The Colony apartments in Casa Grande (pictured), where she stabbed him and then began stabbing herself

Connie Villa was admitted to a Pheonix-area hospital, where she was treated for he stab wounds.

An autopsy was performed on the body of Aniarel by Pima County, but it wasn't able to determine a cause of death.

A toxicology report could take up to three weeks.

Meanwhile,
 Aniarel's shocked family are left to wonder how and if a mother could 
commit such an atrocity and released this statement:

'On
 behalf of Michael Macias, Ania’s father, Vera Macias, Ania’s 
grandmother and extended family, we request that the focus of this 
tragedy be a celebration of our precious Ania’s life.

'She
 was a gentle, kind and beautiful spirit who was taken from us much too 
soon. Michael and his family are heartbroken. Ania was always smiling. 
She loved her brothers and sisters. She enjoyed spending time with her 
father and sister Gaby. 

'We
 are writing this statement in hopes that the media and other outlets 
will allow Michael and our family to grieve peacefully. We thank 
everyone for the outpouring of support for our family. We appreciate 
your prayers and positive thoughts. We pray that justice will be 
served.'

Connie Villa has been released from the hospital and booked on one charge of first degree murder and four charges of attempted.

Ana Mollet is a member of Mothers Of Preschoolers, also known as MOPS says Connie Villa belongs to the group and that’s how they met.

'I met her at one of the meetings. And just before school started she was looking for someone to give her daughters rides after school,” Mollett said.

She volunteered and says Aniarael was a smart, sweet girl.

'I remember her as a fun-loving young lady and she really loved her brothers and sisters,' Mollett said.

She and other mom in MOPS plan to put on a bake sale to help pay for Aniarael's funeral.

'When we heard the tragedy we said, ‘If there's any way we can help just let us know,’” Mollett said.Sarah Lamb is organizing the bake sale. She says Aniarael’s death hurts all of these women.              

'As a mother you never want to see another mother lose their child,' Lamb said.                              

They plan to hold the bake sale at the same place Connie’s family is holding a car wash. That’s at the Pep Boys in Casa Grande.
