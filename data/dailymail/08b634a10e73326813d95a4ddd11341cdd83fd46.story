A group of homeowners woke up to find half of their building had been demolished overnight by developers making way for a new road.

These extraordinary pictures show how developers in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang, simply smashed straight through the building - removing entire rooms and leaving others exposed to the elements.

In some cases water and electricity
 were also severed as the builders ripped away whatever laid in in their path.

Destroyed: Developers smashed many of the apartments in half, leaving some open to the elements

Make way: The building was partially demolished so developers could lay a new tarmac road

The developers targeted dozens of properties where people had refused to move out 
because they were not offered compensation.

Many drivers
 have refused to use the new road - fearing that the properties might 
collapse on to the road at any time.

Now, a bitter legal battle has now broken out between developers and owners - the latter of whom are understandably furious about the situation.

Home owner Bao Jen , 43, whose two bedroomed flat became a one-room studio apartment said: 'The officials said that parts of the buildings that occupied the ground for the new road could be removed by force, so they demolished them but left the parts of the building which are not in the way of the new road.

'So now our homes have ended up like this.'

Many people are still living in the partly demolished homes as they take their demand for compensation to the courts.

'We will not stop fighting until we get due compensation for our broken homes,' added Jen.
