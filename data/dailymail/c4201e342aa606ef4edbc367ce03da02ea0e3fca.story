No police officer will face disciplinary action over the death of Fiona Pilkington who killed herself and her disabled daughter after  a decade of unchecked abuse by yobs.

Yesterday four officers accused of failing to stop the misery inflicted upon the family – who made dozens of 999 calls – were cleared of misconduct.

The inspector, a sergeant and two constables were said in a report by the police watchdog to have ‘cases to answer’.

But Leicestershire Police said 
internal hearings this week had concluded that the case against the 
unnamed four was ‘not proven’.

It means no individual officer has faced any disciplinary sanction over the case.

A spokesman for the force blamed ‘systems and processes’ for the failure to respond to the family’s desperate pleas for help.

At the time Miss Pilkington was 
accused of ‘over-reacting’ to the torment inflicted upon her by a gang 
of youths at their home in Barwell, Leicestershire. In October 2007 she 
killed herself and her 18-year-old daughter Francecca, who had a mental 
age of four, by setting fire to their car in a layby.

The yobs, some as young as ten, threw 
stones and eggs at their home, urinated on their wall, invaded the 
garden and pushed fireworks through the letter box, leaving the family 
‘under siege’.

An Independent Police Complaints 
Commission report found that Miss Pilkington, 38, contacted the force on
33 occasions. Yesterday the family’s solicitor, Jocelyn Cockburn, said 
the family felt ‘let down’ by the force and added: ‘Numerous police 
failings were identified at the inquest and in the IPCC report.

‘It is therefore hard for the Pilkington family to understand why no officer has been found guilty of misconduct.

‘Police very rarely discipline 
officers for misconduct and criminal charges are virtually never 
brought. I invite the investigating officer to release to the family his
rationale in reaching this decision.’

The bodies of Fiona Pilkington, 38, and her daughter Francesca Hardwick, 18, were discovered in a burnt out car The pair had suffered more than ten years of abuse at the hands of local youths in their Leicestershire

The force’s deputy chief constable, 
David Evans, said the misconduct hearings concluded that the mistakes 
made in the case were ‘of an organisational nature due to the systems 
and processes in place at the time not enabling officers to provide the 
most effective service’.

He added: ‘The tragic deaths of Fiona 
and her daughter acted as a turning point for the force in how it 
prioritised and dealt with anti-social behaviour, linking incidents and 
identifying vulnerability.’

The inquest into the deaths heavily 
criticised both the force and the local council. It heard that none of 
the 16-strong gang was ever prosecuted.

At one point one yob told Miss  Pilkington: ‘We can do anything we like to you and you can’t do anything about it.’

Mark Goldring, of the charity Mencap, 
said it was ‘extremely shocking and disappointing’ that no one  has been
held accountable for the failure to protect Miss Pilkington and 
Francecca.

He said the deaths represented ‘a 
complete failure in the police’s ability to respond adequately to 
disability hate crime victims’.

And he called on the IPCC to reopen 
the case to assess whether sufficient changes to policies and practices 
have been made to prevent similar failures.

Youths had taunted the family for a decade, pelting their home with 
stones and threatening them

IPCC's 180-page report said the incidents 
should have been treated as 'hate' crimes
