She said she was worried she'd lose her shape after honing her already impressive physique on Strictly Come Dancing.

But judging by her latest beauty campaign, Abbey Clancy has nothing to worry about.

The model and Strictly star shows off her incredible figure as the new face - and body - of Scholl and Veet.

No wonder she's proud of them! Abbey Clancy reveals that her legs are her best asset as she showcases them in her new Scholl and Veet campaign

Speaking about her new campaign, which sees her showing off her famous assets to perfection in a 1950s style swimwear shoot, Abbey said: 'I’m excited to be 
fronting this campaign for Scholl and Veet. I’ve always thought my legs 
were my best asset and then of course as a model and enthusiastic dancer
 my feet work very hard for me!

'I feel most confident when I’ve carried
 out my beauty basics such as waxing and foot care. It’s not just about 
how great your feet and legs look, but how you feel when they are 
prepped and ready to bare as soon as the sun comes out. 

'Any mum with a full-time job knows that 
fitting in time to do even the simple things like going to the gym and 
shops can be a struggle, never mind having the time to visit a salon. 
That’s why products that are quick and easy to use at home are a God-send.

'With such a busy lifestyle and a little
 girl to run around after I barely have time to visit a salon for beauty
 treatments, so easy-to-use products such as Scholl Express Pedi and 
Veet EasyWax help me get long-lasting professional results from home.

She works out: Since leaving Strictly, Abbey has been maintaining a rigorous work-out regime - and it's clearly paying off

'It’s no wonder women keep their legs and
 feet covered up when they feel unprepared to bare their skin, I know I 
tend to hide in a pair of skinny jeans and ballet pumps when I’ve 
neglected my legs and feet.

'There’s no need to hide away your legs and feet - it’s time to show them
 off!'

A spokesperson for the brands said: 'We are delighted Abbey is our brand ambassador. As a model, TV presenter and one of the UK’s most photographed women, Abbey always looks impeccable.

'Abby is also down to earth and knows home grooming can produce salon-quality results with no fuss. She is aspirational yet women can relate to her. We hope that together we can encourage more women to feel confident and dare to bare this summer!'

Model behaviour: The model and mother-of-one is encouraging women to up their beauty regime ahead of summer

Speaking about her love of summer, Abbey, who has become something of a fashion icon, said: 'I love the beach and spend a lot of time abroad when I get the chance to take time off from work. I love the summer not just for the long days and warm weather but also the fashion. Summer dresses and little shorts are my summer wardrobe-musts .'

Since leaving Strictly, Abbey has been maintaining a rigorous work-out regime and was spotted last week throwing herself into
 an energetic martial arts session in Liverpool with her sister Elle last week.

Emerging
 from the studio looking her usual flawless self, the 28-year-old cut a 
trim image and showcased her legs as she garnered tips from the 
muscle-bound instructor.

Abbey has previously admitted to being worried the intense routines on Strictly made her too muscly and masculine.

Summer style: Abbey says she loves the summer not just for the long days and warm weather but also the fashion, citing summer dresses and little shorts as her go-to seasonal styles

She told the Huffington Post ahead of the BBC show's final: 'I've got a six-pack and no boobs, I'm turning into a boy.

'I've definitely toned up, I'm obviously not used to doing this much intense exercise. But it feels good, I feel healthy.'

Keeping up the fitness drive, Abbey's latest campaign shots, as well as her ones for Ultimo, show she should have no cause for concern over her figure.

The model and TV presenter, who is married to footballer Peter Crouch, has taken over as the new face of the lingerie brand from Michael Bublé's wife Luisana Lopilato.
