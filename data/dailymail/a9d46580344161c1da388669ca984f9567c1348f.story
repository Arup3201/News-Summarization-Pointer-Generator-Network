Homeless: Allan Debenham admitted conning a hotel into believing he was TV star Louis Theroux

A
homeless alcoholic who conned hotel staff into giving him a free room 
by pretending to be TV presenter Louis Theroux avoided jail today.

Allan Debenham, 39, claimed to be the TV presenter and interviewer - 
and even provided a fake contact from the BBC’s finance department as 
proof.

He used the bogus identity to blag a £70-a-night room at the Duke of York pub at Shepton Beauchamp, near Ilminster,  and gave
hotel staff an order number so they could claim payment back from the 
Beeb.

During his three-night stay he also pretended to be Mr 
Theroux’s personal assistant and ordered two bottles of wine from room 
service to add to the tab.

He was only rumbled when staff became 
suspicious when the ‘PA’ telephoned again and asked for for 'some fags' 
to be taken to Debenham’s room.

Debenham, of Taunton, Somerset, was today given a 12 month supervised community order at South 
Somerset Magistrates Court.

He pleaded guilty to two charges of 
making a false representation at a previous hearing - and to a charge of
assault by beating following an attack on his girlfriend.

Chris Ivory, defending, told the court: 'Having lost his home and having no money he was desperate.

'In
desperation he told a hotel establishment and taxi driver that he was 
somebody he was not in an aim of getting shelter for the evening and not
to spend another night under the stars.

'He did state that he was very sorry and that, if he had money, he would pay the bill for the hotel and taxi driver.

'He can only express his remorse to Mr Theroux for any embarrassment he has caused.

'None of these offences were carried out with any malicious intent.'

Debenham
had been made homeless after splitting with his fiance who he assaulted
by grabbing her arm and pushing her back into a wardrobe.

He then 
spent a string of nights 'under the stars' and booked a room at the Duke
of York as Louis Theroux, on April 21 
this year.

At an earlier hearing Emma Chetland, prosecuting, said: 'Later the pub receives another telephone call purporting to be from 
Louis Theroux’s PA who gives a telephone number for the BBC’s finance 
department and an order number to arrange payment.

'He also asks for 
two bottles of wine to be left outside the room. The PA rings again and 
asks for two bottles of cava and some fags - to use his words - to be 
left outside the same room.

'The person taking the call becomes 
suspicious at the use of the word "fags" rather than cigarettes. They go
upstairs and find the door to the room locked.

Impression: Debenham pretended to be journalist Louis Theroux, pictured, and asked for the hotel bill to be sent to the BBC

'They call the 
telephone number that was left and find it to be unobtainable and they 
call the BBC who tell them the order number is not one they recognise.'

Pub
staff called police and Debenham was arrested and investigations 
revealed that the he had also booked a taxi costing £14.50 to take him 
to a pub.

Debenham was handed the order, told he should continue to 
address his drinking problem, and ordered to repay the hotel charge of 
£165 as well as the taxi fare.

He had also been found guilty of assault by beating following the attack on his girlfriend at a previous trial.

Amanda Campbell, chairwoman of the bench, told him the assault was the most serious charge.

She said: 'Mr Debenham, looking at the offences in front of us we consider the assault to be the most serious.

'However
we do think that all those offences have the same route cause. We 
consider that the community is best served by a sentence designed to 
rehabilitate.

'We have also heard that you have been engaging with 
health and mental health services and you have been you doctor and to 
Turning Point and individual alcohol worker.

'Taking all this into consideration we are going to do a community order for a year.'She
also handed him a 12 month restraining order against his former partner
and told him to pay a £100 in compensation and a £60 victim surcharge.

Magistrates did allow Debenham to address them personally.

He said: 'I would just like to say that these last six months have been absolute hell. It has been very difficult.

'I have significant difficulties with
my alcohol use and I am getting help. People say I am doing well and I 
would like to continue that.

'All I can say is that I am very sorry for what I’ve done.'
