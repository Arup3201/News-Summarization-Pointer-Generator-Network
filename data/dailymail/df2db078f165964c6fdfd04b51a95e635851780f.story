The credibility of international cricket suffered yet another huge blow today when ICC chairman N Srinivasan was named by the highest court in India in connection with the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal.

Srinivasan, who earlier this year was forced to step down as president of the Indian board while investigations into the scandal continued, also heads up the ICC’s rejigged anti-corruption unit – calling into question the governing body’s capacity to police itself, let alone an entire sport.

Invited by Sportsmail to comment on the news, the ICC replied: ‘The ICC has no comment at this stage.’

Also named as being involved in ‘some misdemeanour’ relating to the corruption that blighted last year’s IPL, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of three Rajasthan Royals players, were Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, the league’s COO Sundar Raman, and Rajasthan co-owner Raj Kundra.

It has been reported in India that three cricketers were inadvertently named by the court in connection to the investigation: former England Test batsman Owais Shah, Indian all-rounder Stuart Binny, and West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badree. No charge is yet to be brought.

Shah later released a statement saying: 'I have heard today that I have been named as implicated in the Mudgal Report presented to the Indian Supreme Court.

'Prior to the news this morning, I had no knowledge that I was under investigation or suspicion. I have not heard from, been interviewed by or received any form of correspondence from the Mudgal Inquiry or the Indian Supreme Court or anyone connected with it.

'I have no idea what allegations have been levelled at me or what case, if any, I am expected to answer.

'I would have hoped to have received some explanation from the Court that named me, but they have said nothing and made no attempt to explain themselves or to contact me, which is disappointing. 

'Needless to say, this is very distressing as I have as much information as those seeking comment from me. Consequently, I will be making no further statement beyond this one and giving no interviews until I have established exactly what is going on and why I have been named.' 

That leaves six players still to be named from the 13 who were investigated by the panel, led by Justice Mukul Mudgal and appointed last year by the Supreme Court. The next hearing will take place on November 24.

The judges said: ‘We have the seen the report. It does suggest some misdemeanour. We can’t withhold the report. For the present, we will keep the players out and will disclose only the non-players.’

Srinivasan, who owns IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, has maintained all along that he has had nothing to do with the corruption scandal that overshadowed the 2013 edition of the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament.

Yet despite being instructed to step down from the presidency of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Srinivasan rose to the chairmanship of the ICC, the world game’s governing body, in June – a position with a two-year tenure.

He also headed up the takeover of the ICC earlier this year by the boards of India, England and Australia. In private, the ECB have insisted all along that chairman Giles Clarke was dealing with the BCCI as a whole rather than one individual.

But many others queried the ECB’s wisdom in working so closely with Srinivasan while question marks remained about his probity.

Quite how long the ICC will tolerate the name of their sport being dragged through the mud by the alleged ‘misdemeanours’ of their own chairman is another matter.
