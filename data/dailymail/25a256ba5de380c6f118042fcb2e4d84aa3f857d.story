Those who are in need of relief from the blazing heat are best advised to just sit tight – as the prolonged dry spell is set to be interrupted by ‘violent’ thunderstorms and rain today.

Some parts of the country were hit by brief storms last night, but showers are today expected across the UK as the longest heatwave for seven years finally gives way to cooler weather.

Yesterday temperatures reached 33.1C at Heathrow, making it the hottest day of year so far. And although it will be slightly cooler in the coming days, the mercury will still hover around the mid-twenties.

Today is set to be the hottest day in seven years. The hottest July day on record in the UK was seven years ago when a sweltering 36.5C was recorded in Wisley, Surrey, on July 19 2006

A Met Office spokesman said a 
nationwide weather warning had been issued because of the risk of 
localised flooding on dry ground, which could make driving hazardous in 
places.

She said thunder and lightning was 
likely across the UK, with short sharp showers giving a soaking to many 
areas. A Meteogroup forecaster said: ‘It’s going to be sticky, 
oppressive and close, and will make things feel quite uncomfortable.

‘It will be almost tropical in the way it feels.

‘Some very violent weather could be 
kicking off, with thunderstorms across quite a lot of England, Scotland 
and Wales. We will see quite lively storms.’

He said it will stay warm, with temperatures up to 30C (86F) on Tuesday but declared it was the ‘end of the official heatwave’.

Forecasters predict that a band of thunderstorms due to sweep the country from today will bring muggy weather with it as it douses the parched country, meaning uncomfortable sticky nights lay ahead for many.

Parts of the UK will see 96 per cent humidity this week - muggier than Nigeria.

As the week progresses humidity levels across the country are expected to reach into the 90s, with Leeds seeing humidity levels reach 96 per cent on Wednesday.

This compares with with 92 per cent humidity in Lagos on the same day.

Humidity in London will climb to 86 per cent on Wednesday. Meanwhile Newcastle will see humidity top 92 per cent and Birmingham 84 per cent.

The muggy conditions are expected to spread and persist during the week, according to Met office spokesman Tony Gray.

The Met Office has issued a rain 
warning for tomorrow for most of England and all of Wales, with 
localised flooding possible in places and the Environment Agency has issued flood warnings for the South West.

'We could have a few fat spots of rain coming out of the sky over widespread areas on Monday' said Mr Jones. 'With the high temperatures, it will be almost tropical in the way it feels tomorrow.

'Then
from Monday night and into Tuesday, some very violent weather could be 
kicking off, with thunderstorms across quite a lot of England, Scotland 
and Wales. We will see quite lively storms.

'It will stay pretty warm as well, with temperatures up to 30C (86F) on Tuesday, and some humidity.'

In London, firefighters were shifting their focus from fighting grass and forest fires to being on flood alert, after heavy rain warnings were issued for the capital and elsewhere. Peter Cowup, London Fire Brigade's acting head of operational procedures, said: 'Heavy rainfall can create fast-flowing water that may look safe but can be powerful enough to knock you off your feet.

'We want people to stay well away from any floodwater, streams and rivers and to keep a close eye on their children and dogs to make sure they stay away from the water.'

The hot weather has taken its toll on
the UK in recent weeks, with grass fires in London, mountain blazes in 
the Welsh valleys and forest fires in Fife, Scotland.

Hundreds of 
premature deaths are believed to have been caused by the heatwave. Wildlife experts have warned of the 'tinder-box' conditions across some landscapes after days of hot, dry weather.

Devon Wildlife Trust has teamed up 
with Devon & Somerset Fire & Rescue Service to urge people to 
take care to avoid fires in the region, which can devastate habitats 
that are key to rare species as well pose dangers to people and 
farmland.

Members of the 
public are being urged not to drop cigarettes, use barbecues or leave 
glass or bottles in the countryside, all of which can start fires, and 
to report any blaze they see to the emergency services immediately.

Steve
Hussey, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said: 'Wildfires can be devastating 
for wildlife, as well as potentially dangerous for people and damaging 
to farmland.

'Heathlands, 
with their coverings of dry gorse and grass, are particularly vulnerable
when the weather remains hot for several weeks. At present many 
heathlands are in 'tinder-box' condition.'

He
added: 'This is a habitat which has declined by more than 80% in the 
last 200 years. The few remaining heaths are key places for rare 
wildlife which includes Dartford warblers, common lizards and adders.'

Paul
Slaven, of Devon & Somerset Fire & Rescue Service, said: 'We 
want to remind people to be mindful of the impact and damage that wild 
fires have on the environment.

'These fires also a have a further impact, tying up valuable fire resources for some time.'
