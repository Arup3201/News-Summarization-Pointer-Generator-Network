Devotees of paper and ink have long argued that ebook readers are missing out.

And soon they might be proved right – as books sold in good old-fashioned bookshops begin promising more material.

Extra chapters will appear in copies bought from high street retailers that will be absent from ebooks or printed copies sold by online stores such as Amazon.

Secret weapon: Joanne Harris fans who buy their copy of her latest book from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available anywhere else

The move is an attempt to end the dominance of the internet retailers – and bring shoppers back to the high street.

Fans of Chocolat author Joanne Harris who buy her follow-up novel, Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, from Waterstone's will find it includes an extra chapter not available to those who snap up their copy at a reduced rate from Amazon or other web retailers.

The book chain signed an exclusive deal with the popular writer in the hope it will encourage readers to turn their backs on internet stores and e-books and return to browsing the shelves at high street bookshops.

The chapter is not essential to the plot of Peaches For Monsieur Le Curé, but can be read either as an epilogue or the 'prologue to an as-yet-unwritten story', the author has said.

Internet giant Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year, racking up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter. It put the surge in sales down to boost from Kindle e-book sales, which were up a staggering 70 per cent.

Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year in a clear indication of the continued mass migration of shoppers from the high street to the web.

The web giant racked up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from £10bn in the same period of the previous year.

Kindle e-book sales -up a whopping 70 per cent - were credited for the surge in profits.

Overall sales were up by 22 per cent, driven by the popularity of the Kindle Fire.

'After five years, electronic books is a multibillion dollar category for us and growing fast,' Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said at the time.

The figures are in stark contrast to the picture on the high street, which is home to less than half the number of bookshops today as seven years ago due to book lovers deserting physical stores in favour of downloading e-books for Kindles and other tablets, or of ordering cut-price copies over the internet.

That supermarket shoppers can add a bestselling paperback to their trolley for as little as £4 in Tesco or Asda has also contributed to the demise of the high street bookshop, where the same copy might cost twice as much.

The partnership between Harris and Waterstone's is among a number of novel tactics being employed by traditional booksellers as they attempt to preserve their place on the beleagured British high street.

Alexander McCall Smith, author of the smash hit No1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, recently teamed up with Foyles to produce an extra short story to accompany copies of his novel Trains And Lovers on sale in its stores, while acclaimed author Ian Rankin has also penned bookshop-only bonus material.

Waterstone's also previously offered a limited edition of Claire Tomlinson's biography of Charles Dickens which included a map of London and other extra material.

Tom Tivnan, features editor at book industry magazine The Bookseller, said it was essential for bookshops to seek new and innovative ways of ensuring their survival.

'They have to work out what things they can do that online retailers can't,' he told the Independent, citing membership clubs, coffee shops, and creches as means of luring bookworms away from the internet and back into stores.

'Physical bookshops have to survive,' said Mr Tivnan.

'Authors and publishers really want to keep bookshops and libraries open.'

Despite the backing of top authors 
the traditional bookshop still has its work cut out when it comes to 
winning back customers. The number of bookshops in the country now stands at less than 2,000. Seven years ago the figure was double that.

The bookworms' mecca of Hay-on-Wye, home to one of the world's biggest literary festivals, has lost five of its 30 independent bookshops from 2011. The blow led to local booksellers including Derek Addyman, who runs three second-hand bookshops in the Welsh border town, to call for Kindles to be banned from last summer's festival.

Mr Addyman branded the devices 'an enemy' that needed to be driven out.

It is not just independent bookshops that have been wiped out by internet giants and the rise of the Kindle, the collapse of 40-year-old chain Borders was blamed on increasing pressure from cut-price books available online and in supermarkets.

And bookshops' online competitors are not blind to the potential of exclusive offers for their customers, with many authors coming up with short stories that are available solely for e-readers to download.
