Doctors believed it would be at least six months before Filipe Luis kicked a ball again following his horror leg break in January 2010.

It was one of those sickening moments, his right foot dangled limply as he held his leg by the calf.

Chelsea's latest recruit, in a match against Athletic Bilbao while at Deportivo, had made a penetrating run down the left flank, passed the ball and continued into the box.

Horror: Doctors thought the defender would be out for six months after breaking his leg against Athletic Bilbao

When it was headed back across goal Luis leapt to divert the ball under the goalkeeper and into the net, but Bilbao's Gorka Iraizoz landed heavily on top of him and the leg snapped.

His team-mates stood with heads in hands. Deportivo manager Miguel Ángel Lotina held his eyes closed in anguish.

The left-back had played every single minute of the campaign up until that moment. He shouldn't have played another. Remarkably, he was back before four months had passed.

When Henrik Larsson broke his leg playing for Celtic against Lyon in October 1999, under a similarly innocuous challenge from Serge Blanc, it took him nine months to recover.

Former Arsenal forward Eduardo was out for a week shy of one year following his nightmare leg break from Martin Taylor's challenge in February 2008.

It is the sort of injury than can shatter not just a players' bones but their confidence, but Luis has continued to grow as a full-back since.

Ouchy! Ex Arsenal forward Eduardo suffered an horrific leg break against Birmingham in 2008

As a youngster he was highly-rated but failed to get a break. 

He was playing in the first-team of Brazilian side Figueirense aged 18 and the following season went on loan to Ajax. He could not make it out of the reserve team and they decided not to make their interest permanent.

Luis moved to Uruguayan side Rentistas but Real Madrid immediately took him on loan. Again, he was stuck in their B team and they did not take up an option to buy him.

Then Deportivo came in for the player and it was there he began to make his name as one of the best full-backs in La Liga.

Whereas the likes of Dani Alves, at Barcelona, and Marcelo, at Real Madrid, are praised for their ability to maraud forward but are considered suspect at the back, Luis is different.

He is equally adept at defending as he is going forward. Standing 6ft he is tall for a full-back and strong in the air as well as with the ball at his feet.

Forward thinking: Barcelona's Dani Alves (L) and Marcelo of Real Madrid can ignore defensive responsibilities

The summer after his leg break, following four years at Deportivo, he signed for Atletico Madrid in an £11.3million deal.

Still he continued to blossom.

Last season he was part of an Atletico Madrid back line which conceded just 26 goals in 38 league games, beat off the financial clout of Barcelona and Real Madrid to win the Spanish title and came within 90 seconds of winning the Champions League. In that campaign he made two assists, had an 80 per cent passing accuracy and won 107 tackles.

Luis, 28, has not always gone down the conventional route. He turned down the opportunity to move to Barcelona to increase his own chances of progression.

'If I had gone to Barcelona, I would have won a couple of Champions League titles, but I wouldn’t be as happy as I am here at Atlético,' Luis said.

At Atletico he developed a strong relationship with manager Diego Simeone, claiming that 'I think he's changing our lives' and 'each year that goes by, I’ ve improved working with him.' That appears soured after Simeone forced him to train with the reserves ahead of his move to Stamford Bridge.

Friends reunited: Felipe Luis will join former Atletico teammate Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge

At Chelsea, where he will wear the No 3 shirt vacated by Ashley Cole, he will re-join former Atletico team-mate Diego Costa.

On his debut for the Spanish champions in September 2010 he was awarded man-of-the-match after setting up Costa for the only goal of the game, making a typically surging run down the left before cutting a low ball back for the striker to tap in.

How he, and Chelsea fans, will be hoping for a similar debut again.
