Roy Keane has pulled out as a World Cup pundit for ITV as he closes in on a deal to become Paul Lambert's assistant at Aston Villa.

The former Manchester United midfielder turned down the job as Celtic manager but is on the brink of a move to Villa Park as he chooses to concentrate on his coaching career rather than his media commitments.

An ITV spokesperson said: 'Roy has been a tremendous part of our pundit team in recent years, but we fully understand his decision to concentrate wholly on his coaching. We wish him every success for the future.'

Keane's decision to snub this summer's tournament in Brazil isn't the first time he has turned down the chance to perform at the World Cup.

The tough-tackling midfielder fell out with Republic of Ireland boss Mick McCarthy ahead of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea after being left unimpressed by his country's preparation for the tournament.

Keane, who was playing for Manchester United at the time, had a furious row with McCarthy and told him: 'Mick, you're a liar... you're a f****** w*****. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a f****** w***** and you can stick your World Cup up your a***. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your b*******.'

Unsurprisingly he was sent home by his manager.

Keane has been a regular pundit for ITV's Champions League and England coverage in recent years, winning plaudits for his straight-talking and honest approach.

He was involved in the channel's World Cup launch just two weeks ago alongside fellow pundits Lee Dixon, Gus Poyet, Fabio Cannavaro and Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill.

But appearing with O'Neill at an event in London, Keane confirmed that he will not travel to Brazil for this summer's international showpiece.

Keane had been expected to be appointed 
as Neil Lennon’s successor at Parkhead after talks but the 42-year-old 
instead chose to work with Lambert, as the role would allow to also 
continue as O’Neill’s No 2 with the Republic of Ireland. 

Lambert and Keane held talks before Celtic’s failed attempt to land their former midfielder and he will replace former assistant manager Ian Culverhouse, who was sacked last month.

His new role at Villa Park, where he will try to help the club improve on their miserable 15th place finish last season, may also be able to accommodate his role as a pundit for ITV on Champions League nights.
