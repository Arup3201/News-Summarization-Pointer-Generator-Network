A country home that looks like it could have been designed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins has gone on the market for just under £1million.

The wacky house appears to blend in with its surroundings just like the Lord of the Rings character’s humble Hobbit hole.

The five-bedroom property is nestled deep in the rolling hills of Wales’ Snowdonia National Park - although it would not look out of place in Middle Earth.

The lounge: Mr and Mrs Saunders had been living in rural Wales for around 20 years when in 2000 they decided to make their dream a reality

It was designed by acclaimed architect Christopher Day, who modelled it out of clay before agreeing its final look with owners Peter and Judith Saunders.

The house is called Cynefin, meaning ‘a sense of place’ in Welsh, and is in the tiny village of Llanegryn in Gwynedd wih unrivalled views over the Dysynni Valley.

It is on the market through estate agents Strutt and Parker for £985,000.

Mr and Mrs Saunders, both 63, are selling up to move closer to their three sons and four grandchildren who live in Cardiff.

Mr Saunders, an entrepreneur, said: 'My wife Judith and I had been living in rural Wales for around 20 years when in 2000 we decided to make our dream a reality and build our own house.

'We bought three plots of land next to one another and turned them into one. We found a great architect called Christopher Day who had been a sculptor before becoming an architect.

'He came round to our house and sketched out a few ideas then shaped out the house from a lump of clay.

'We loved it and the build started in 2001. It took two years to build and we moved in in 2003.

'The design of the house is totally organic and original - it’s very simple and honest and flowing.

The house which is up for sale wouldn't look out of place in Middle Earth like this Hobbit-hole featured in the film Lord of the Rings

'There are very few right angles in the property. It inspires people to think about their surroundings and gives a real sense of peace and harmony. Inside everything is handmade from oak and ash. It’s incredibly tactile, a real work of art.

'Friends often refer to Bilbo Baggins and his Hobbit hole when they step inside the house. We had always wanted a spectacular property with stunning views and that is exactly what we ended up with.'

Belinda Hutchinson-Smith, from Strutt and Parker, said: 'Cynefin has to be seen to be fully appreciated. The quality of craftsmanship and the uniqueness of the house is truly exceptional. The smallest of details has been thought through. There truly is no other house like it.'
