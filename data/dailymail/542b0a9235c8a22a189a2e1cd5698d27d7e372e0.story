This adorable puppy was abandoned by his owners when all of her hair fell out leaving her completely bald.

Pearl, a Shar Pei dog, suffers from demodectic mange - a skin condition caused by an over-sensitivity to parasitic mites that live on canines' skin.

In most dogs, these mites never create problems, but they can cause irritation and hair loss when animals have an impaired immune system or have recently suffered intense
stress or malnutrition.

Abandoned: Pearl, pictured with an RSPCA worker Lizzie Aston, was found abandoned in Bulkington Recreation Ground in Nuneaton, West Midlands, after she developed demodectic mange causing all her fur to fall out

Common ailment: Demodectic mange is caused by an over-sensitivity to parasitic mites that live on the skin

But the condition can even lead to death by causing severe inflammation if not treated.

The dog could have been treated easily but its owner chose instead to abandon it in a park.

Pearl was rescued by the RPSCA in Bulington, Warwickshire on October 13.

RSPCA inspector Louise Labram said: 'When our officers found this poor dog, she was suffering from demodectic mange, and she had clearly been left untreated for weeks.

'This could have been treated and sorted quickly and easily had the owner just taken her to a vet.

'But for whatever reason, whoever owned Pearl just abandoned her and left someone else to pick up the pieces.'

Demodectic mange is considered a common puppyhood ailment with around 90 per cent of cases resolving on their own with no treatment.

Easily treatable: If Pearl's owners had taken her to the vet, she could have been treated with insecticides, antibiotics or shampoos

New home: Pearl is now being cared for by Lizzie Acton and other RSCPA staff in Coventry, Nuneaton

But more severe cases, where the condition is spread over the whole body like Pearl, can be treated with insecticide, antibiotics and shampoos.

The 10-month-old pup is now being cared for by staff at the RSPCA Coventry, Nuneaton and District Branch.

Glenn Mayroll, animal centre manager, said: 'Pearl is doing well and has now begun treatment for the demodectic mange - and this involves various dips and baths - which she doesnâ€™t seem to mind.

'We think she is just around 10 months old. Pearl is a gorgeous and happy friendly girl and really affectionate and fussy.

'It breaks my heart to think someone has left her to suffer and then just dumped her without a care in the world.'

Treatment: Around 90 per cent of demodectic mange cases heal on their own but Pearl is now being treated with special shampoos

A special coat: Lizzie Aston puts a coat on Pearl, which she will wear to keep her warm until her hair grows back
