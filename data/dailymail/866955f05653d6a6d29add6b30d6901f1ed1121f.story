A boy whose tale of dying and going to heaven after a car crash that became a best-selling book has admitted to making the whole thing up.

Alex Malarkey, now 16, lay in a coma for two months and was left paralyzed after the wreck in 2004, but when he awoke, he amazed doctors and his parents with a story of how an angel had lifted him up to heaven where he met Jesus and Satan.

His story was made into the best-selling book The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, which was co-authored with his father Kevin and first published in 2010. 

But now Alex has claimed it was all a lie.

Lie: Alex Malarkey says he made up his account of ascending to heaven which was made into a best-selling book after he was in a car crash at the age of six with his father in 2004. He is pictured last year

Divorce: Alex co-wrote the book with his father, pictured. He is now divorced from his mother and lives separately from his son

In an open letter shared by his mother, he says he concocted the tale in an attempt to attract attention  - and is now criticizing publishers who continue to make large profits from the book.

His mother, who is recently separated from his father and the author of the book, says Alex does not receive any money from the novel, which made the New York Times Bestsellers List.

In an open letter addressed to 'Sellers, buyers and marketers' of his book, Alex wrote: 'I did not die. I did not go to heaven.' 

'I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention. When I made the claims that I did, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to.' 

Many Christian publishers are now announcing that they will stop selling the book.

The book is one of three 'real-life' tales of paradise on sale at Christian book stores - 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real are the others.

Alex is still severely disabled and is cared for by his mother at home in Ohio. They live together in Huntsville with his three siblings. Kevin Malarkey lives in Columbus, Ohio.

Long before Alex made his statement, Beth Malarkey has previously suggested that the book was made up and insists that the family receives no money from its sale.

She  wrote on her blog in April last year: 'There are many who are scamming and using the Word of God to do it.' 

The book describes heaven thus:  

'When I arrived in heaven, I was inside the gate. The gate was really tall, and it was white.

It was very shiny, and it looked like it had scales like a fish. I was in the inner heaven and everything was brighter and more intense on the inside of the gate. It was perfect.

Perfect is my favorite word for describing heaven.'

Alex also describes in the book how he floated above the scene of his crash and talked to Jesus while firefighters extricated his body from the wreckage.  

Controversial tale: In the letter, Alex criticizes publishers who profit from his book. His mother, left, says the family does not receive any money from the sales. He is now 16.

Home life: Alex is able to stand with the help of a brace and has been taken on runs by his mother, right

'It is both puzzling and painful to watch the book The Boy who Came Back from Heaven to not only continue to sell, but to continue, for the most part, to not be questioned. 

She insists that her son 'has not received monies from the book nor have a majority of his needs been funded by it.'

And she adds that Alex previously told a pastor that the book was made up, but was told the publication was 'blessing' people and to stay quiet. 

She concludes: 'The ones making money from the book are NOT the ones staying up through the night, struggling for their breath, or were they the ones at six years old, waking up unable to move or breathe and in a strange place after last remember seeing a car coming right at the car he was riding in'. 

Alex's letter continues his attack on Christian booksellers

He wrties: 'They should read the Bible, which is enough. The Bible is the only source of truth. Anything written by man cannot be infallible.'

Home life: Alex, pictured before the accident, has been recovering for years after the crash and is still cared for by his family at home

Steelers fan: Alex writes that 'People have profited from lies, and continue to' in the open letter about his book 

In the letter, which features on the Pulpit and Pen website, Malarkey went on to say: 'It is only through repentance of your sins and a belief in Jesus as the Son of God, who died for your sins (even though he committed none of his own) so that you can be forgiven may you learn of Heaven outside of what is written in the Bible…not by reading a work of man. 

Malarkey said he wrote the book because he thought it would get him 'attention'; it became a best seller

'I want the whole world to know that the Bible is sufficient. Those who market these materials must be called to repent and hold the Bible as enough.'

The book, which features the description 'Miracles, Angels, and Life beyond This World', has been a popular read in Christian book stores and had a 4.3 rating on Amazon. It became part of a popular genre of books known as 'heavenly tourism'.

Another young boy's tale of going to heaven, Colton Burpo from Nebraska has recently been made into the movie Heaven is For Real.  

The publishers description on the book reads: 'In 2004, Kevin Malarkey and his six-year-old son, Alex, suffered an horrific car accident. The impact from the crash paralyzed Alex–and medically speaking, it was unlikely that he could survive. 'I think Alex has gone to be with Jesus,' a friend told the stricken dad. 

'But two months later, Alex awoke from a coma with an incredible story to share. Of events at the accident scene and in the hospital while he was unconscious. Of the angels that took him through the gates of heaven itself. Of the unearthly music that sounded just 'terrible' to a six-year-old. And, most amazing of all . . . Of meeting and talking to Jesus.

 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven' is the true story of an ordinary boy's most extraordinary journey. As you see heaven and earth through Alex's eyes, you'll come away with new insights on miracles, life beyond this world, and the power of a father's love.' 

One of the book's stockists, The Lifeway Christian Bookstore, told the website it plans to remove the book from its shelves and send back its current stock. 

In a statement, its director of communications, Martin King, said:  'LifeWay was informed this week that Alex Malarkey has retracted his testimony about visiting heaven as told in the book 'The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven.' Therefore, we are returning to the publisher the few copies we have in our Stores.'
