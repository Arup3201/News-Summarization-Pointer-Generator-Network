Team GB's astonishing medal haul at London 2012 has been further boosted in the final event of the Games after Samantha Murray took a silver medal in the women's modern pentathlon.

Cheered on by thousands of patriotic supporters in London's Greenwich Park, the 22-year-old finished the Olympics off in fine style with Team GB's 65th medal.

Murray, from Preston, was eight seconds behind top spot when she started the run-shoot finale but caught up to finish second.

Proud: A delighted Murray is pictured with her silver medal. Team GB's Mhairi Spence finished 21st

Success: Cheered on by thousands of patriotic supporters in London's Greenwich Park, the 22-year-old finished the Games off in fine style with Team GB's 65th medal of the Games

The race was won by Lithuania's  Laura Asadauskaite while Team GB's Mhairi Spence finished 21st.

Speaking to the BBC, a delighted Murray said: 'Honestly, if you have a goal - if there's anything you want to achieve in life - don't let anybody get in your way. 

'You can do it. If I can do it, and I'm a normal girl, anyone can do what they want to do.'

The silver medal for Murray now means British pentathletes have won medals at all four Games since it was introduced in 2000.

Advice: Following her medal win, Murray said if there is something people want to achieve in life then they should go for it

The modern pentathlon requires the athletes to be multi-talented across a range of disciples.

It includes five events - pistol shooting, fencing, 200m freestyle swimming, show jumping, and a 3 km cross-country run.

Apart from the fencing competition, the athletes do not compete directly against each other.

Points for each event combine to give overall total scores.

For the final event - the cross-country run -  the competitors are ranked according to their score from the first four rounds.

They are given different start times with the leader going first.

One of the most bizarre aspects of the event is that the running and shooting elements are contested in tandem - with athletes having three bouts of shooting each followed by a 1000m run.

Since 1949 an annual World Championship has taken place in non-Olympic years.

In recent years there have been calls for the removal of the penthalon from the Games because of its lack of widespread popularity outside Eastern Europe.

Murray started the final combined event eight seconds behind leader Laura Asadauskaite.

She began the third phase of the competition, the show jumping, in third place and, although her round was not without its dramas, her score of 1140 was good enough to put her fourth overall.

Spence won the world title in Rome in 
May while Murray picked up the bronze, earning both their spots in 
London at the end of a fierce qualification battle.

Among those to miss out was Beijing silver medallist Heather Fell, so the pressure was on the British pair to perform.

The
action began this morning in the Copper Box with the fencing, an event 
where Spence usually excels, living up to her nickname 'Fencey Spencey'.

She
was not quite on top form today, winning 19 of her 35 bouts for 856 
points, which put her tied for 11 but 100 points down on where she would
have wanted to be.

Murray had the worst possible start, 
losing her first seven fights, but she recovered impressively and ended 
the fencing only one win behind Spence in joint 16th.

That was a good result for the Lancastrian, though, as, unlike her team-mate, fencing tends to be her weakest discipline.

Her
strongest, the 200 metres freestyle swim, came next, and Murray did not
disappoint, posting a time of two minutes 08.20 seconds.

She was touched out by Hungary's 
Sarolta Kovacs, who broke the Olympic record with 2min 08.11sec, but her
score of 1264 was enough to move her up to third place.

Spence was a couple of seconds off her best but posted a decent time of 2:16.51, climbing to ninth.
