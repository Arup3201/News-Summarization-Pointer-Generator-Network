Lucas Piazon is ready to hit the road again. Not only on Chelsea’s pre-season training camp in Austria but also for another season away from London as he continues his quest to impress Jose Mourinho.

After six months with Malaga in Spain and a prolific season at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland, Piazon is preparing for another loan move, possibly to Germany because Mourinho is keen to see him tested in a tougher competition, like the Bundesliga.

The Chelsea boss will watch with interest. As will an audience in Brazil. Piazon possesses the poise and elegance missing from Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team at the World Cup and many hope this is the season when he makes a stride towards realising his huge potential.

Out to impress: Chelsea's Lucas Piazon, 20, will go out on loan again this season, likely to the Bundesliga

Several talented young footballers will exit Stamford Bridge on loan before the end of August to a temporary new home in a new environment, all of them after the same result.

'I will try to keep improving myself and have a good season,' said Piazon, still only 20 and under contract until 2017. 'It is time for me to grow up and do something that will keep me in the plans for Chelsea.

'It’s where I want to play. It’s a club I really like and where the people treat me well from the day I first arrived. If not, I must show another club what I can do but I came from Brazil when I was 17 to play for Chelsea and that is still the target for my career.

'I know it is difficult, they have the best players in the world. That’s why we are all going on loan, to improve ourselves and try to be back one day. The young players always talk about it. We say: "It’s time to go on loan again, meet new people and find a new coach". Sometimes it’s hard but it’s necessary if you want to reach where you really want to be.

Ups and downs: Piazon had a stellar start to the season with Vitesse scoring 11 in 16 games, but fell away

Proving himself: Although he's been sent away from England, Piazon believes he made the right move

'You get the wrong loan and you lose one year from your career. Every single loan, every single season is important for a footballer. Or you find the right loan and you get minutes, confidence and experience; you get the rhythm of the game. It is good to be playing every week. When you ‘re not playing you’re not happy.'

Piazon had a sweet and sour time at Vitesse, the Dutch club with a special relationship with Chelsea. He started in sublime touch, scoring 11 in his first 16 games as Vitesse raced away to the top of the league. They were daring to dream in Arnhem of their first ever title and the Champions League when the season collapsed.

Weight of a nation: Piazon could be part of the new breed of Brazilians to turn the national team's fortunes around

They won only four of 19 after the mid-winter break and finished in sixth, missing out on Europe, and Piazon did not score another goal. He was dropped in the New Year and unhappy that he seemed to be singled out as a scapegoat for the team’s loss of impetus by manager Peter Bosz.

'Everybody was going crazy, saying: What’s happening?' said Piazon. 'The coach was like this, too. We had difficult games. Nobody was playing well. And he changed just one player, as if I was the only problem. I don’t think I should have been the one to blame but that was his choice.

'In the end, I think everyone could see I wasn’t the problem. He chose to take me out and after this we won only three games. We finished sixth and lost at home in the play-offs. If he wanted change, he had to change more people than just myself.

'I decided I had to wait for the season to finish and then find a new beginning. But now when I look back, I’m pleased with my time at Vitesse. It’s a nice club. I arrived and started a game three days later, I scored some goals and played some minutes. We were top after 20 games.'

After this experience, there was no question of him returning, but his goals in Holland made an impact in Brazil and Piazon received his first international call-up since the U17 World Cup in Mexico in 2011, the same year he left Sao Paulo for Chelsea.

He was called into the U20 squad for the Toulon tournament, made three appearances, scored once and flew home with a winners’ medal to enjoy the World Cup.

'After almost three years outside the Brazilian squad, it was good to play with a few of the guys I knew from before,' said Piazon, who had played youth football at Sao Paulo with Rodrigo Caio, voted the best player at Toulon, and midfield playmaker Ademilson.

Both have broken into Sao Paulo’s senior squad but Piazon has no regrets about his decision to move to Europe at 17. Were he still at his former club, he would be competing for a place in the attacking unit with the formidable trio of Kaka, Luis Fabiano and Alexandre Pato.

Here, he may be about to leave on loan again but there are signs of progress and encouragement which Chelsea hope will mature and flourish this season.

'The move to Europe has been good for me,' Piazon said. 'I’m OK with my career. I played in Spain. I played in Holland and three games at Chelsea. I didn’t make a mistake. It was the right choice. I was 17 in Sao Paulo and I was training with the U17s, so I think it was the best thing for me at that moment. I hope I’m right.'
