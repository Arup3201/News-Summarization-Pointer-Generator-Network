Liverpool defender Glen Johnson looks certain to leave Anfield when his contract expires this summer as he looks at clubs which he feels could help 'turn around his career'.

Johnson was a late substitute in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Swansea City on Monday night but is already looking for a new club despite Brendan Rodgers' attempts to keep hold of the England full back.

It seems likely that Johnson will follow the example of fellow English full back Ashley Cole and opt for a move abroad when his deal expires, though there is a chance he could stay in the Barclays Premier League is the right move comes up.

Jonathan Barnett, Johnson's agent, says his client is looking for 'somewhere where he can turn around his career', indicating that the England right back does not see his long-term future in Merseyside. 

'He's obviously looking for things at the moment. He's looking at many clubs,' Barnett said.

'Glen is obviously looking for somewhere where he can turn around his career. That's the most important thing for him. (Somewhere) where he can play nicely under a good club that's challenging for things. That is where he wants to be.'

Serie A side Roma had been touted as one potential destination in a move that would see Johnson reunited with former England team-mate Cole, but Barnett says the club from the Italian capital are yet to get in touch.

'I can't really say if he is considering Roma, we've had no contact with Roma, although Rome would be a lovely place for him,' Barnett added, speaking to RomaPress.

'Ashley Cole absolutely adores it there, I represent him as well. Ashley thinks very highly of Rome but we've had no contact with Roma regarding Glen.'

Johnson has played 21 times for Liverpool this season but has not started in the Premier League since the 3-0 defeat to Manchester United on December 14.
