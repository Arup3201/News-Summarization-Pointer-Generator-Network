Nipper, the famous HMV dog, has been immortalised with his own blue plaque in London.

The terrier cross was painted in 1899 sitting with his ear to a wind-up gramophone and featured on hundreds of millions of records produced by the HMV label over more than a century.

His place in musical history was marked at a special ceremony last week organised by the British Plaque Trust and attended by executives from HMV, which stands for His Master’s Voice.

The plaque will be unveiled to the public early next month. 

Nipper (1884-1895) had many superstar fans in the world of music, with artists as varied as Elvis, The Beatles and leading classical performers posing with his image.

The plaque will be displayed at the Cavalry and Guards Club, 126 Piccadilly, Central London, where artist Francis Barraud, the dog’s final owner, painted Nipper from memory.

Disc gramophones first appeared in the 1890s and by 1902 the forerunner to HMV, the Gramophone Company, was taking shape. The first HMV store opened in July 1921 on Oxford Street.

In 1931 the Gramophone Company, with its His Master’s Voice record label, merged with the Columbia Gramophone Company to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (EMI), meaning that Nipper not only featured on the HMV label, but also on associated brands including RCA Victor and Deutsche Grammophon.

The British Plaque Trust raises funds for blue plaques to commemorate personalities and organisations that have contributed to the British way of life.
