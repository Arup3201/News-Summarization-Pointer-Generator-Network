Experts have managed to solve one of the biggest problems blighting Britons living at the South Pole - creating a real ale that can survive the extreme cold at the world's most inhospitable place.

Brewers have now produced a special version of the British staple, which can now withstand temperatures of down to minus 90 degrees Celsius and the 10,000 mile journey from the UK.

Previously ales brought there could not cope with the low temperatures on Antarctica, as it would freeze and kills its taste.

Problem solved: Explorer Rob Brown will be one of those enjoying the special beer that can withstand the coldest place on Earth - the South Pole

This special beer - called Pole-Axed - is due to be shipped 10,000 miles to the Southernmost continent on the planet this week for engineers and scientists working there to enjoy.

The ale, which has a secret recipe, is currently being put into plastic bottles, which will then have the air squeezed out of them.

The process allows the liquid to expand when frozen and prevents the vital gas from escaping.

After it reaches its destination it will be kept safe until Christmas 
Day when a team of explorers will drink it as part of their celebrations.

Freezing: Ale could not cope with the extreme temperatures but pole-axed stays liquid down to minus 90 degrees Celsius

Winding down: Until now Britons have been unable to enjoy ale while working near the South Pole because it would freeze and lose its taste

Propping up the bar: At last the beer can be enjoyed on Antarctica, which is being shipped in special vacuum packed bottles

Aidan Lavin and Stewart Cross developed the drink at the Platform Tavern’s Dancing Man Brewery.

The pair spent a painstaking month fermenting the beer, which is based on a 200-year-old Indian Pale Ale, IPA.

Their recipe includes hops imported from the North West coast of America and is fruity to the taste.

Aidan, from Southampton, said the secret to its success was its 6.7 per cent alcohol content.

The 32-year-old explained: 'We were asked to brew the beer by some of 
the members of the Oceanography Centre who are regulars in the pub.

'We’ve never been asked to do anything like it before but we decided it would be fun and we’d give it a go.

'The beer had to withstand the a long journey and freezing temperatures so we agreed it must be strong.

'We looked at 200-year-old IPA recipes for inspiration because those 
beers were created to survive being exported all the way to India.

'Our final recipe includes special hops that have been imported from America, which give it a fruity taste.

'It took 10 hours to brew and then we left it for a month to ferment, 
during that time I had to check it every day to make sure it was right.'

He added: 'When it was finished we let the guys from the NOC test it and
 it went down really well. We’re really pleased with the result.

A team from the British Antarctic Survey and the National Oceanography Centre will be conducting research at Subglacial Lake Ellsworth for three months.

They wanted a special pint for their hard work - but it would have to survive the long and freezing journey to the Antarctic.

Rob Brown, from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, is one of the team who will be enjoying the beer in Antarctica.

The engineer said: 'The project at Lake Ellsworth is extremely big so a beer will be well deserved at the end of it.

'We’ve never asked a brewer to do this kind of thing before but we thought it would be a nice idea.

'I’ve had a taste of it already and it’s a brilliant beer. It will be a great treat for Christmas day.'
