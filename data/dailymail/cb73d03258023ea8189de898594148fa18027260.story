France’s Prime Minister has ordered his cabinet to stop using English after two colleagues named a new proposal the ‘silver economy’.

Jean-Marc Ayrault wrote a sternly-worded letter telling ministers: 'The language of the republic is French.'

The PM’s edict comes after the French culture ministry to issued a list of English words to be banned from their language, including ‘email’, ‘blog’, ‘supermodel’, ‘take-away’ and ‘low-cost airline’.

'The language of the republic is French': French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayraulth as ordered his cabinet to stop using English after two colleagues named a new proposal the ¿silver economy¿

Now Mr Ayrault has told ministers: 'Our language is able to express every contemporary reality, and describe innovations that are constantly being born in the areas of science and technology.

'French has been inscribed in the constitution since 1992 as the language of administration and of the courts.'

The ‘Silver Economy’ is a plan being proposed by industry minister Arnaud Montebourg and pensioners’ minister Michele Delaunay to group together all businesses related to older generations.

One of their advisers attempted to justify the now-forbidden term saying: 'The English term seems to us most appropriate for a sector planning to expand exports'.

In January, France’s official language police, the Academie Francaise called for the French to stop using the words ‘hashtag’ and ‘cloud computing’.

Two years ago the Academie issued a 65-page black-list of English words, including obscure terms like ‘shadow-boxing’, ‘detachable motor caravan’ and ‘multifunctional industrial building’.

Senior French government adviser Herve Bourges warned at the time that the global domination of Anglo-Saxon culture had plunged the future of the French language into crisis.

He said: 'French is being besieged by the growing numbers of English speakers around the world.

'English speakers have a vision of the so-called English-speaking world, but an equivalent concept does not seem to exist in France.

'Despite having 200 million French speakers on earth, the idea of a French-speaking world is becoming obsolete.'

Education minister Luc Chatel sparked outrage last year when he announced plans to start teaching English to French schoolchildren from as young as the age of three.

Mr Chatel told i-Tele TV: 'The French are bad at speaking English and this is a true weakness of our country.'

And French academic Claudia Senik caused more anger among language purists in February when she said French people would be less miserable if they spoke more English and other foreign languages.
