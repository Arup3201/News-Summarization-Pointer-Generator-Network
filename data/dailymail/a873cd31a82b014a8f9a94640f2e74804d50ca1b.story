Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has suffered a fresh thigh injury which threatens to rule him out for another month.

Sturridge pulled out of a training session at Melwood on Monday with a strain to the same thigh he injured on September 5 while on international duty with England.

Liverpool will assess the damage over the next 48 hours with a scan planned for Tuesday. The results are expected on Wednesday but they will now be forced to plan to face Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday without him.

Sturridge had been upbeat after returning to training last week and took time on Tuesday to post a message on Instagram saying: ‘Can’t wait to be back playing. Wish I was with England though not gonna lie but my body is ready now and that’s all that matters.’

However, his body has let him down once again with Liverpool staff inevitably concerned how it has happened after taking so much care in his recuperation.

Manager Brendan Rodgers also has concerns over Mario Balotelli’s fitness after the mis-firing striker returned early from international duty with Italy nursing groin and hamstring strains.

Sturridge’s initial injury came from a training session that Liverpool claim the striker told Roy Hodgson he did not want to take part in. He was out for almost six weeks before injuring his calf in the warm-up to his first session back with the senior squad ahead of the visit to QPR last month.

It had taken Sturridge, whose last Liverpool appearance was in the 3-0 win over Tottenham on August 31, another month to return after that setback.

Liverpool have scored just 14 goals this season and are in 11th place with Balotelli, Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert having failed to score a goal between them in 888 Premier League minutes.

Apart from Palace, Liverpool face Ludogorets in Sofia next Wednesday needing to win to keep their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League alive.

Meanwhile Liverpool have offered defender Glen Johnson a new two-year contract - but the deal is worth half his current wage.

The England right back has been offered in the region of £60,000 a week, a big reduction on his current £120,000-per-week salary.

Johnson is reluctant to accept the offer, leaving his future at Anfield in doubt.

The 30-year-old can hold pre-contract talks with foreign clubs in January, and it is very likely that he will leave Anfield at the end of the season. Roma have already shown interest.
