The husband of the 36-year-old Brooklyn teacher charged with having repeated statutory trysts with one of her high school students wants a divorce, it has been revealed.

A source told the New York Post that Jimmy Lathrop, 39, is now looking for a lawyer to help him divorce his wife Erin Sayar, who is accused of statutory rape

He was seen yesterday at Brooklyn Criminal Court, wearing a fedora and glasses, and walking several steps ahead of his wife, who looked disheveled in a bright pink track suit.

Married mother: Erin Sayar, 37, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse

Silent: Sayar was released from jail for now but she faces four years behind bars for alleged sexual encounters with the high school football player; she's pictured returning to her Brooklyn home

The source told the Post: ‘He’s very angry, he’s very embarrassed,’ adding that Mr Lathrop is out looking for a divorce attorney.

‘I don’ think this marriage will last,’ the source told the newspaper.

Mother-of-one Sayer, who is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at Brooklyn's James Madison High School, appeared in court yesterday for arraignment.

Sayar was released on $10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct.

Kevin is still a student at the high school.

As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student.

Sayar - who is facing more than four 
years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office
 while his teammates were using the weight room next door.

Consequences: Sayer has been placed on 10-years probation and may have to sign as a sex offender for the rest of her life

A chaotic scene unfolded outside the courthouse as reporters and camera crew surrounded Sayar and her husband, Jimmy Lathrop, as they left after the woman was released from jail.

The pair refused to speak with reporters.

Sayar remained silent and smirked 
slightly at times as she walked dressed in a pink-hooded sweatshirt, 
black pants and white sneakers with pink shoelaces.

Instead, Sayar got into a sedan and returned to her home. Mr Lathrop also dismissed news crews wearing a top hat and his wedding ring.

The parents of the 16-year-old also filed a $10million lawsuit against the married English teacher.

According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention.

Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in 
sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going 
to her office — and the door was locked.

'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell "Go to class!" and "Get out of the hallway!",' Reid said.

The lawyer representing Eng is 
claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him
 the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'.

But other students said he was proud of the affair.

The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November.

Illicit: Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, allegedly had sex with student Kevin Eng when she was meant to be tutoring him

Allegations: She pleaded guilty to having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School

After hacking Eng's Facebook account,
 the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so
 much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'.

Sayar replied: 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.'

Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations.

'We had weight training every day in 
sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going 
to her office - and the door was locked'

Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend.

According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times.

The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day.

One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car.

'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body.

A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January.

The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired.

Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school.

The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals.

Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied.

Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.
