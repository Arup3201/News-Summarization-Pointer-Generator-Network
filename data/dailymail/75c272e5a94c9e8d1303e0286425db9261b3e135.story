After a blistering start to his career at Old Trafford, Angel di Maria is looking less and less like a £60million player.

The British record transfer fee spent by Manchester United  immediately put the Argentine under pressure to perform following his move from Real Madrid - something he appeared to relish at the start of the season.

But now he looks lost and is struggling to find the form he showed during his last season in Spain. United need more from their most expensive player ever.

Di Maria isn't the only star to have failed to immediately justify a huge price-tag, although others have taken on the responsibility with aplomb.

With that in mind, Sportsmail takes a look at how players signed for £50m and more fared after sealing their big-money moves.

Gareth Bale - Tottenham to Real Madrid £86m

The most expensive footballer of all time, Bale has endured a mixed spell in Spain since swapping London for Madrid in the summer of 2013.

The Welshman slotted into Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded team with ease in his first season, scoring in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals to win over Real fans.

But this season, despite netting 12 goals in La Liga and Europe, the former Southampton youngster has been subjected to boos from some sections of the Bernabeu faithful. 

VERDICT: HIT

Cristiano Ronaldo - Manchester United to Real Madrid £80m

Undoubtedly the biggest success story on our list, Ronaldo can almost be regarded as a bargain given his goal-scoring prowess since leaving Old Trafford in 2009.

The Portuguese star netted his 290th goal in his 281st appearance against Elche on Saturday, taking him to 29 league goals for the season.

With one La Liga title, a Champions League crown and the Club World Cup among the trophies to his name already, he could well help Los Blancos win more come May.

VERDICT: HIT

Luis Suarez - Liverpool to Barcelona £75m

The main man at Liverpool before his summer move to Barcelona, Suarez has found goals harder to come by alongside superstars Lionel Messi and Neymar.

Often forced to play wide rather than through the middle, the Uruguayan has found the back of the net just four times in 15 La Liga outings since returning from a four-month ban for biting.

The 27-year-old has eight assists in the top flight and another couple of goals in the Champions League but is yet to recapture the form which almost helped Brendan Rodgers' men to the Premier League title last term.

VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT

James Rodriguez - Monaco to Real Madrid £63m

Signed on the back of a brilliant World Cup campaign with Colombia, Rodriguez has adjusted to life at Real Madrid with relative ease.

Comfortable out wide or behind striker Karim Benzema, the former Porto man has scored eight league goals in his debut season  to help Ancelotti's men to the top of the table.

Currently out injured for two months with a broken foot, Rodriguez will hope to continue to justify his sizeable fee when he returns for the title run-in.

VERDICT: HIT

Real Madrid's James Rodriguez was signed for £63m after a brilliant World Cup with Colombia

Angel di Maria - Real Madrid to Manchester United £60m

Between August 30 and December 31 Di Maria scored three goals, recorded six assists and created 31 chances in 12 appearances. In his six games since New Year's Day, he is yet to score, has two assists and has laid on just 11 chances. 

The Argentine's dip in form is worrying given the way he took to the Premier League at the start of the season, although it should be noted that United, as a team, are yet to hit top gear.

There is more to come from the ex-Benfica midfielder, but he cannot allow this slump to continue.

VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT

Zlatan Ibrahimovic - Inter Milan to Barcelona £59m

When Barcelona paid Inter Milan £40m plus Samuel Eto'o, it was a gamble. Unfortunately for Pep Guardiola, it didn't pay off.

The Sweden international scored goals in the 2009-10 season after moving to Spain but problems with his manager and the culture of the club meant that he moved to AC Milan on loan just a year after joining.

A permanent transfer for around half what they paid for him followed in 2011.

VERDICT: MISS

Zlatan Ibrahimovic joined Barcelona for the equivalent of £59m but left on loan after just one season

Kaka - AC Milan to Real Madrid £56m

One of the best players in the world when Real Madrid brought him to Spain, Kaka never really managed to exhibit the talent which won him the Ballon d'Or in 2007.

Injury troubles and poor form restricted him to just 120 appearances over four seasons, a return which did little to justify his then world-record fee.

A free transfer back to AC Milan followed in 2013, before a move to soon-to-be MLS side Orlando City. Still only 32, the Brazilian magician never quite fulfilled his enormous potential.

Edinson Cavani - Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain £55m

A major investment by Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2013, Cavani has continued to establish himself as one of the most dangerous strikers in world football since leaving Italy for France.

The Uruguayan bagged 16 goals in Ligue 1 during his debut campaign but only has eight so far this term, having often been shunted into a wide role to accommodate Ibrahimovic.

The scorer of PSG's goal against Chelsea in the Champions League last week, Cavani continues to attract interest from clubs in England. A similarly massive fee would be needed to take him away from Paris. 

VERDICT: JURY STILL OUT

Radamel Falcao - Atletico Madrid to Monaco £51m

Currently struggling for form  on loan at Manchester United, Falcao hit a more than respectable nine goals in his first 17 games for Monaco before suffering a season-ending injury.

He began this season well, scoring twice in three games, but was then shipped out to Old Trafford as the Monaco continued to cut costs after spending big in recent years.

The former Atletico Madrid striker looks certain to leave his parent club permanently this summer, although they hope to recoup much of the £51m they paid for him.

VERDICT: MISS

Radamel Falcao managed just half a season with Monaco before suffering a serious knee injury in early 2014

Fernando Torres - Liverpool to Chelsea £50m

Perhaps the least successful big-money signing on our list, Torres' four-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge were a huge disappointment after his goal-filled spell at Liverpool.

The Spaniard scored 45 times in 172 appearances for the Blues but was a shadow of the player who dominated opposition defences under Rafa Benitez at Anfield.

A  transfer to AC Milan  followed in January, before a long-term loan to former club Atletico Madrid gave him a much-needed fresh start.

VERDICT: MISS

David Luiz - Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain £50m 

Not many people could believe it when PSG agreed to pay Chelsea £50m for David Luiz, a defender with an unfortunate habit of making decisive mistakes.

The colourful Brazilian made the switch to Paris last summer and has been in solid form for Laurent Blanc's side since, winning 79 per cent of his headers and completing 90 per cent of his passes.

Despite some good performances in Ligue 1, Luiz still managed to allow Branislav Ivanovic to score the opening goal when Chelsea visited Parc des Princes in the Champions League last week.
