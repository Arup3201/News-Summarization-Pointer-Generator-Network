The big freeze will turn into a deep freeze tomorrow as temperatures hurtle down to -8C (18F) in parts of rural Britain.

It came as forecasters put out weather warnings for ice and snow across the country, predicting the arrival of snow in London, Surrey and Hampshire by Thursday.

Residents affected by last week’s floods were also warned to expect around an inch of rain.Some 40 flood alerts were issued for the South East and South West alone.

Chill in the air: A high pressure front moving from Siberia into Scandinavia, and then ridging westwards, can give the British Isles a bitter easterly airflow

Sarah Holland, a Met Office 
forecaster, said: ‘There are going to be some snow showers around the 
east coast tomorrow, possibly up to an inch or two in places.

‘We could also see some snow flurries and wintry showers over northern 
parts of England and Wales.

'Temperatures will only get up to about 3C 
(37F) and we also have a big ice warning for Wales and the South East.

‘We also have a band of rain moving in from the South West bringing up to 25mm (nearly an inch) in a short, sharp burst.

‘After the recent heavy rain there is a chance we could see some 
localised flooding and potentially hazardous driving conditions.

‘There will be widespread frosts and in the Midlands we could see 
temperatures dip to possibly -8C (18F) in rural locations overnight.’

Many believe Britain could be heading towards one of the coldest winters
 on record. The conditions are being put down to high pressure over Scandinavia, which has seen cold air tearing over Britain from the north-east and raising hopes for a white Christmas.

The Big
 Freeze that heralded the start of December is set to continue, with 
sleet, snow and hail covering much of the country all week.

The
 cold snap will persist, with temperatures dropping to a 
lower-than-average -8C in Scotland and four inches of snow expected 
tomorrow, and another four inches likely later in the week.

High pressure in Scandinavia can 
indicate one of the most well-known snow setups, in which the pressure 
front moves from Siberia into Scandinavia, and then ridges westwards, 
giving the British Isles a chilly easterly airflow.

Continental air from Russia is very cold and dry, but as this air passes over the North Sea, it warms up and picks up moisture.

This
 gives rise to layers of grey cloud and mostly dull dry weather, with a 
little drizzle or fine powdery snow for eastern areas. 

When
 the high pressure to our north is not particularly strong, or the 
airmass has a long track over the North Sea, or there is a strong 
contrast between surface and upper-air temperatures, there may be enough
 instability in the atmosphere to produce cumulonimbus clouds.

These can give rise to heavy prolonged snow showers for eastern Britain, and snow flurries for western Britain.

BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes tweeted today: 'I spy with my little eye Scandinavian high. Ecmwf [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts] forecast middle of December could bring us really bitter snowy weather....fingers crossed!'

The wintry conditions are expected to last all month, unleashing sub-zero temperatures, freezing fog and icy 30mph winds.

Bookies last night slashed the odds of a white Christmas to 5/1 in the capital and to 6/1 in other cities across the country.

The Met Office and police have issued warnings to drivers over ice and snow on the roads.

One driver in 
Salterhebble, Halifax, last night had a lucky escape when 
his van was left hanging 10 feet above a stream after skidding on ice and ploughing through a collapsed wall.

The incident happened at around 
7.30am when the van slipped perilously close to the Hebble Brook in the West Yorkshire town.

Earlier this year, a resident warned of the danger facing drivers using the road because of the collapsed wall.

There were several accidents throughout the area after rain 
turned to ice overnight,  but nobody has been hurt.

Met
 Office forecaster Dan Sabbagh said: 'We've got a warning for ice and 
snow out on the roads, especially in the north-east of Scotland.

'There could be two to four inches 
(5-10cm) of snowfall on high ground there until 12pm tomorrow, with up 
to two inches (5cm) on lower ground.

'There will be showers this evening in south-west areas, mixed with thunder and hail.

'Rain, sleet and snow could be anywhere overnight, with snow on high ground throughout the Midlands and the North.'

'Tomorrow it will be dry and cold, mainly 3-4C in the North but possibly reaching 6C in the South.

'It will be a cold night, with some cities reaching -4C and the coldest parts of Scotland dipping to -8C.

'We'll wake to widespread frost on Thursday with a rainfront coming in from the North-East, and some snow here and there.'

Age Concern warned elderly people in 
the North West, North East, Yorkshire & Humber, West Midlands, East 
Midlands, and East of England that there was a strong chance of icy 
conditions and/or temperatures falling below 2C from Tuesday evening 
until Friday 7 December.

They advised people with health 
concerns to keep bedroom windows closed at night, wrap up well when they
 go outside and keep bedrooms at 18C.

The organisation's website adds: 
'Exposure to cold weather for prolonged periods of time can be 
dangerous.

'It raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and can 
cause problems for people with breathing difficulties such as asthma.'

It has been a colder than average start to December, with average lows at -2 to -8C, where usually they are 1C.

The Met Office said today that it is likely to be a colder than average Christmas, but this does not necessarily guarantee snow.
