The father of an Australian soldier who was sent hate letters by  Man Haron Monis following the death of his son in Afghanistan, has told media he pitied the man.

When Lance Corporal Jason Marks was killed serving with the Special Operations Task Force in Uruzgan Province in 2008,  his father Paul Marks began receiving the abusive letters from Monis.

'I feel sorry for him, he is so twisted, to live with that hate,' Mr Marks told the Herald Sun of the man responsible for Monday's fatal Lindt cafe siege.

Paul Marks, father of Lance Corporal  Jason Marks who was killed in Afghanistan in 2008, says he pitied Man Haron Monis, who started sending his family abusive hate letters after his son died in action

Lance Corporal Jason Marks,  in Afghanistan 2008, was called a 'killer of innocents' by Monis in letters to his family after his death

Paul Marks and other families of fallen Aussie soldiers, who were similarly targeted by Monis after the deaths of their sons overseas, are joining the call for a review of Australia's bail laws after Monday's siege.

Marjorie Worsley, whose son Private Luke Worsley was killed  in a battle with Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan in 2007, said today's tragedy should never have happened.

Ms Worsley told reporters how she and her family lived in fear of a man who knew where they lived and who started making abusive, 'ideologically driven' phone calls to their home after the death of their son.

She told the Age authorities at the time had assured her and her family that Monis was not a violent person. He was 'more verbal, than action,' they said.  

Man Haron Monis, 49, who took 17 people hostage in the Lindt cafe in Sydney, was previously convicted for sending abusive letters to families of Australian soldiers who had died overseas. He was sentenced to community service

In 2013, Monis was convicted of sending  menacing letters to the families of seven fallen Australian soldiers. He and wife Amirah Droudis were sentenced to community service over the letters, which relatives at the time said accused the Australian soldiers of killing innocent children.

'Why are they out walking around? There is something wrong with our court system, the police catch them and do their job, but the courts …' Ms Worsley said. 'I think the bail needs to be reviewed.' 

The family of Private Luke Worsley, an Australian Commando killed in action in 2007, received a 'condolence' letter of abuse from Monis on the day of their son's death. His mother says she feared for her family's safety because Monis man knew where they lived

Both families today expressed their condolences to the families of Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson, who died after the bloody 16-hour siege early this morning. 

Mr Marks told the Herald Sun his thoughts and 'empathies' are with the families. It had been a painful day for his own. 

'Every time an Australian soldier was killed after Jason it was like a scab coming off an old wound, and this is like that as well,' Mr Marks said. 'We are taking it very quietly today, not leaving the home.'

Pallbearers carry the coffin of Private Luke Worsley to a waiting hearse following his funeral in Sydney in 2007.
