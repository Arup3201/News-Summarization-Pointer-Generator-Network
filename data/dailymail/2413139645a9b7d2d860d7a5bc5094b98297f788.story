Daily attack: Christine Blower (above), secretary of the National Union of Teachers, says teachers are being driven out of the profession early because of excessive workload and the fear of Ofsted inspections

Soaring numbers of teachers are taking early retirement amid threats to their pensions, figures revealed yesterday.

Almost 9,000 teachers left before the statutory retirement age last year – the highest figure since 1997.

Teachers’ leaders blamed the demands of dealing with unruly pupils as well as pressure from targets and Ofsted inspections.

They also cited pay freezes and changes requiring teachers to pay more into pension funds.

The figures – from the Department for Education – also show more than 230,000 qualified teachers aged under 60 are no longer working in schools.

A further 80,700 trained as teachers but never entered the classroom. Vast numbers of teachers are ‘out of service’ even though school rolls will rise after a surge in births.

The teachers’ pension age is 65 but those joining prior to 2007 can get their pension at 60.

Some 8,880 state school teachers took early retirement in 2010/11 – 1,570 more than the year before.

There were only 2,370 early retirements in 1998/99. Most retiring teachers were aged 55 to 59 but a small number were in their early fifties.

The average pension for those retiring early was £15,000 a year – excluding lump sums.

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘Excessive workload, a restrictive curriculum and the intense worry and fear regarding Ofsted inspections would certainly lead to many teachers wanting to take early retirement.'

She added: 'The teaching profession comes under almost daily attack and criticism from Government and Ofsted.

‘In too many schools, planning and assessment requirements have become formulaic burdens which have become the bane  of teachers’ lives – add to that pay freezes and threats to pensions.’

Teaching unions are battling the Government over pensions, which are becoming less generous due to the squeeze on public finances. The clash has already led to strikes.

Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is a tough job and it’s not surprising teachers are being ground down by teaching disaffected children and relying on a curriculum that is not relevant.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘It’s no surprise that teachers who joined the profession in the 1970s might choose to draw their pensions early – as is their right.’

He said reforms, including giving teachers more freedom to do their jobs, should help attract and retain staff.
