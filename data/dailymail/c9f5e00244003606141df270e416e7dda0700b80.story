Cyber attack: Betfair admits more than 3.1 million accounts with encrypted security questions were hacked

Online gambling firm Betfair today admitted it had not told its customers about a major cyber attack  18 months ago where millions of credit card details were stolen.

More than 3.1 million account names with encrypted security questions, 2.9 million usernames, and nearly 90,000 account usernames with bank account details were stolen.

And the company admitted it did not discover the attack had taken place until two months later when a server at its Malta data 
centre crashed.

In total, nine servers in the UK and two in Malta were affected.

Betfair said it did not inform its 
registered customers of the attack as its system made the data unusable 
for fraudulent activity and it was able to recover all the information 
intact.

The betting group said it had contacted the Australian Federal Police and German authorities over the attack, believed to be the work of criminals based in Cambodia. 

A confidential internal report commissioned into the theft, seen by the Daily Telegraph and published today, was sent out to staff on September 27 last year - six days after Betfair announced its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange.

Unfair: Betfair kept details of the major cyber attack under wraps for more than a year

The company moved to reassure customers by saying it had carried out a  review of its security and Betfair's systems have been strengthened so they now conform with best practice guidelines on the protection of customer details.

A spokesman said: 'We have subsequently implemented all of the recommendations from the independent reports we commissioned and have done everything we can to minimise the risk of this happening again.'

Betfair's share price has fallen 41 per cent since it listed at 1300p last October as revenue growth has been lower than expected, while it has also suffered a string of management departures and regulatory problems.

Also the poor performance of LMax, Betfair's new financial exchange retail trading platform launched last year, has not helped the company's share price.

Chief executive David Yu and chairman Edward Wray have both recently indicated they will stand down.

Mr Yu, who was the company's former chief technology officer prior to taking over as chief executive, said in June he would not renew his contract when it expires in October 2012.

This month, Edward Wray also said the group was looking for a deputy chairman who could take over his role at the appropriate time.

Betfair shares today rose 1.5 per cent.
