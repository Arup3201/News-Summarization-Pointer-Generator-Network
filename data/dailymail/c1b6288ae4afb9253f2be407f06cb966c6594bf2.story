Louis van Gaal appears to have the Midas touch already at Manchester United.

The Dutchman hasn't been long in the Old Trafford hotseat but seems to have stamped his authority on the squad.

Ahead of United's opening pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy on Thursday, Van Gaal underwent shooting drills with his squad.

Speaking directly to Wayne Rooney, Antonio Valencia and Phil Jones the Red Devils boss was filmed teaching them how to become prolific in front of goal.

'Before you shoot you have to look at the goalkeeper,' he said. 'And then your shot doesn't need to be very hard.

'It has to be in the corners. You can see what the goalkeeper is doing.'

'Is he like that or like that? Then you have to shoot. Keep noticing that,' he added, gesturing to the trio on how to beat a goalkeeper.

Phil Jones was quick to receive praise from the former Ajax, Bayern Munich and Barcelona boss after heeding his instructions during training.

And the words of van Gaal clearly worked as United crashed home seven goals in a thumping pre-season win against their MLS opponents - with Rooney finding the back of the net with a penalty in the first-half.

Following Thursday's win at the Rose Bowl Stadium, United now head to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid during their USA tour.
