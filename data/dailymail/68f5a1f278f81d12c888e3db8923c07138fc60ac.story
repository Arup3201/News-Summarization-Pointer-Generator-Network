Accused: Iran state TV identified the man as Amir Mirzaei Hekmati

An American accused by Iran of working for the CIA could face the death penalty, it was reported today.

In a closed court hearing, the prosecution asked for capital punishment for suspect Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, said the semi-official Fars news agency.

Hekmati is alleged to have 'admitted' receiving training in America and planned to imply that Iran was 'involved in terrorist activities in foreign countries' after returning home.

The prosecutor said 28-year-old Arizona-born Hekmati entered Iran's intelligence department three times.

HekmatiÂ  repeated a confession broadcast on state television on December 18, according to the Fars report. Under Iranian law spying is punishable by death only in military cases .

His lawyer - identified just by the surname, Samadi - denied the charges. He said Iranian intelligence blocked Hekmati from infiltrating and in Iran, intention to do so is not a crime.

The lawyer claimed Hekmati was deceived by the CIA. No date for the next court hearing was given.

Identification: Hekmati was shown saying he entered the U.S. Army after finishing high school in 2001 and received military and intelligence training

Hekmati's family is of Iranian origin. His father, who lives in Michigan, said his son is not a CIA spy and was visiting his grandmothers when he was arrested.

Iran charges that as a U.S. Marine, he received special training and served at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to the country for his alleged intelligence mission.

But his father Ali Hekmati, a microbiology professor at Mott Community College in Flint, Michigan, said: 'He is not a spy. It's a whole bunch of lies on my good son.'

He added: 'They have lied about any American ... captured in Iran for visiting or tourism, or for any other reason.'

The CIA declined to comment, as did State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.

Iran and the U.S. are locked in a complicated intelligence and technological battle, and the video of Amir Hekmati comes weeks after Iran first displayed a nearly intact American spy drone that it claims it captured and forced down electronically.

U.S. officials say the unmanned aircraft malfunctioned and has demanded Iran return the top-secret aircraft, but Iran has refused.

Ali Hekmati said his son was a former Arabic translator in the U.S. Marines who entered Iran about four months ago.

At the time, he was working in Qatar as a contractor for a company 'that served the Marines,' his father said, without providing more specific details.

Ali Hekmati said of the visit to Iran: 'My wife tried to talk him out of it. The first two weeks went without incident.

The third week in Tehran, some people visited him and took him away. Nobody heard from him in the next three months.'

He later saw on a YouTube broadcast of an Iranian program that said Amir was 'locked up' and accused of 'being a spy for the CIA.'

In the video broadcast on several Iranian TV channels, Hekmati was shown saying he entered the U.S. Army after finishing high school in 2001 and received military and intelligence training.

'Their [U.S. intelligence] plan was to initially burn some valuable information, to give it free so that [Iran's] Intelligence Ministry would see the good things and then would contact me,' said in a part of the confession that was broadcast.

The voice of an unnamed announcer on the video said U.S. intelligence was certain that Iran's secret services would not ignore the data. Therefore, they provided a mix of correct and false information to mislead Iran's intelligence but tempt it at the same time.

In September, Iran released two Americans held in a Tehran prison for more than two years after they were arrested.

Iranian officials accused them of spying, but they say they were innocent and had got lost while hiking.
