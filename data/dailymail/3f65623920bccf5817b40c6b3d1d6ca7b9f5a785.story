A former employee of a Fox station  has shot himself dead outside the company's New York headquarters after accusing the news channel of 'ruining his life.'

Phillip Perea, 41, of Irving, Texas, shot himself once in the chest just before 9 a.m. outside the building in Manhattan's midtown. 

Mr Perea had worked for FOX 7-KTBC in Austin as a promotions producer until June last year when he claims he was fired after 10 months.

Police said Mr Perea had also been handing out fliers, which criticized his employer for having 'ended my career,' moments before he shot himself, reports WSJ.

He was asked to leave by security guards, but then he shot himself with a small-caliber pistol.

He was taken to nearby Bellevue Hospital in critical condition, but pronounced dead an hour later. 

Kris Lew who works on a coffee-and-food cart told the Wall Street Journal she 'heard two shots—'Pop. Pop.'—really quick.'

'I know what gunshots sound like…It was a thing where I thought to myself,'Those sound exactly like gunshots, but it can't be, because we're in Rockefeller Center.''

One tweet posted on Mr Perea's Twitter page on Thursday showed a photo of a wallet and said 'this is all the money I have left to my name, $104' 

Just before he shot himself, Mr Pera posted this message on his Twitter account 

Mr Perea had what appeared to be a suicide note in his pocket.

Mr Perea criticized Fox News on his Twitter page writing statements such as 'will be homeless thanks to FOX lies. Is this the America you want?' 

He also wrote other 'tomorrow the battle for liberty begins' as well as tweeting media figures asking them 'Will you take FOX executives into the no spin zone?'

Mr Perea posted dozens of videos on YouTube in which he states why he believes he was suspended and then fired from Fox News.

The lengthy clips, uploaded to YouTube between July of last year and Monday morning, have recordings of alleged conversations between Perea and coworkers. 

The most recent video starts with the chilling intro 'you can murder a man without killing him' before segueing into another screen where he claims 'righteous cause demands a martyr.' 

He states that '2014 was the worst year of my life and with a new year it is time for Fox News to have the worst year of its existence' and that his 'sacrifice' is to 'help everyone.'

The building on Sixth Avenue houses News Corp arms such as Fox News, Dow Jones & Company and The Wall Street Journal. 

'This morning, a former employee at FOX 7-KTBC (Austin) committed suicide outside FOX Television Stations' headquarters in New York City,' Fox Television Stations CEO Jack Abernathy said in a message to employees Monday.

'He was employed at our Austin television station for ten months and has not been with the station or FTS since June 2014. We are deeply saddened by this tragedy.' 

'We are deeply saddened by this tragedy.'
