The pregnant Duchess of Cambridge has pulled out of attending the high profile British premiere of The Hobbit in London tomorrow due to her continuing sickness.

Kate, 30, who was hospitalised last week after developing hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition which leaves sufferers battling constant nausea and vomiting, suffered a relapse on Sunday and is now deemed too ill to attend the charity gala.

Royal sources stressed there was no cause for alarm and said Prince William would attend without his wife as planned.

But it is clear that the Duchess has been hit badly by the illness, which affects three in every one thousand pregnant women, and she will continue to rest quietly at their home in Kensington Palace for the foreseeable future.

A spokesman for the couple announced today: ‘The Duchess of Cambridge will not attend The Hobbit Premiere tomorrow evening and will continue to rest privately. The Duke of Cambridge will attend as planned. ‘

William is understood to be keen not to let down the organisers as the event, being held at the Odeon in London’s Leicester Square, is the official 65th Royal Film Performance and is the principle fundraiser for The Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund’s (CTBF’s), which supports film and television industry employees and their families in times of hardship.

Before the performance of Academy Award winner Sir Peter Jackson’s ‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’, the royal  will meet trustees and beneficiaries of the charity, the film makers and members of the cast.

Kate, who is barely eight weeks pregnant, was hospitalised for three days last week after repeated vomiting left her severely dehydrated.

She was admitted to the King Edward V11 Hospital in London on Monday where her condition was stabilised by introducing fluids and nutrients via an intravenous drip.

She was finally  sent home on Thursday morning with a batch of anti-sickness tablets - and strict instructions to rest.

On Saturday night William, also 30, attended a tennis gala in London without her where he tried to make light of the awfulness of his wife’s condition as he told fellow guests: ‘They shouldn't call it morning sickness as it's a day and all night sickness.’

The following day, however, he was forced to cancel a planned appearance at the British Military Tournament at Earl’s Court after she fell ill again.

At this stage her condition is not deemed serious enough to require further hospital treatment, but doctors are keeping a close eye on the Duchess to ensure she does not becomes dehydrated again.

The couple are now spending the day quietly together at Nottingham Cottage, the home they share in the grounds of Kensington Palace, as Kate attempts to recover.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: ‘It is well known that hyperemesis gravidarum often recurs and, until further notice, to allow the Duchess a degree of privacy during her pregnancy, we do not intend to offer regular condition checks or advise of routine developments associated with it.’

Hyperemesis gravidarum can cause such severe sickness and nausea that sufferers can even vomit blood.

It is thought to be caused by elevated levels of the ‘pregnancy hormone’ hCG, which the body begins to produce after conception.

The condition tends to appear at around six to eight weeks into pregnancy and for most sufferers disappears towards the end of the first trimester.

But for some it can go on as long as five months into the pregnancy and, occasionally, right until birth.

Consultant obstetrician Daghni Rajasingam, spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said that once out of hospital, it is important sufferers maintain their intake of fluids and eat small amounts as they will no longer be on a drip.

She said: ‘Essentially, women who have hyperemesis gravidarum would just be resting and maintaining hydration, and maintaining their food intake as much as they can and controlling the nausea and vomiting symptoms.

‘They should eat anything they find palatable, what they can keep down, it's a matter of working out the things that make the nausea worse. It's different for different women.

‘Fluid intake is really key, water being the best liquid.’

The condition can cause extreme weight loss but Ms Rajasingam said women will put the weight back on once they are eating and drinking again.

She added: ‘It's directly related, really, to how much vomiting they have had and if they are managing to keep food down and absorbing calories from what they eat.’

Asked about the amount of rest the Duchess is likely to need, Ms Rajasingam said: ‘The sort of advice a woman would be given would be to take it easy over the next few days and be reasonable about the amount of activities depending on how active they were before.

‘The advice would be to be sensible and to do things in moderation, but certainly a period of rest and recuperation is good.’

And she did not rule out the Duchess being readmitted to hospital, especially if the sickness last for longer than three months saying: ‘For a small group of women it may continue [longer than three months], and for an even smaller group of women it goes on until the baby is born. For them, further periods in hospital may be necessary.’

Hyperemesis gravidarum is treated by giving women fluids intravenously and by anti-sickness tablets.

Other ways of stopping symptoms apparently include eating ginger, using pressure bracelets or sucking on ice lollies.

Last week the Mail revealed that William is currently on compassionate leave from his role as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot but is due back at work at RAF Valley on Anglesey towards the end of next week and may be forced to leave his wife in London if her condition persists.

The couple have also yet to make a decision on where they will spend Christmas. Sources close to William say he is unlikely to be working, but need to confirm whether they will join the Royal Family at Sandringham for their traditional celebrations or spend it quietly with the Middleton family in Berkshire in light of Kate’s condition.
