It is well known as the City That Never Sleeps.

And now the hustle and bustle of New York City has been captured perfectly by Polish filmmaker Kamil Nowak in a time lapse video featuring some of the most famous sites of the Big Apple.

Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and the Empire State Building are all featured, among others, in the short film.
