A newly-released 911 call has revealed how two teenagers rescued a kidnap victim after she mouthed 'Help me!' to them from the car where she was being held hostage.

Aaron Arias, 19, and Jamal Harris, 17, were next to another car at a stoplight in Seagoville, near Dallas two weeks ago when they looked across at a woman who was in the backseat.

'It's me and another guy, so we're 
checking out the girl in the backseat because we're like, "OK, she's 
kind of attractive",' Arias told the operator in the dramatic call. 'And then, all of the sudden the guy is turned back, looking at us.'

He said the blonde woman, whose 
identity has not been released, looked worried and was 'saying "Help me"
or something, whispering it', according to the recording released to NBC5.

After seeing the woman in distress, the teenagers immediately called 911.

'I'm on the highway,' Arias tells the Kaufman County Sheriff's Office dispatcher in the recording. 'I'm witnessing
a robbery; not a robbery - a kidnapping.'

Officers responded within 
minutes and pulled the car over. Dashcam footage, which was also 
released to NBC5, shows the woman being taken to safety by police 
officers.

'Thank God. You guys are awesome,' Arias 
told the dispatcher as police arrived on the scene. 'Oh my God. Oh my 
God. Get him! Oh my God.'

Little did the teenagers know the 
extent of the alleged kidnapping; NBC5 reported that police found a gun 
and knife inside the car when they apprehended her alleged captor, Charles Atkins Lewis Jr.

The 25-year-old woman had been kidnapped late on August 25 as she left a downtown Dallas office building.

Lewis allegedly smacked her across the head with a pistol and forced her into her own car.

He drove off and a few minutes later, he threw her cell phone from the window of the moving car.

They
were eventually stopped by police officers nearly 40 miles away in 
Kaufman. Arias, a 19-year-old Texas A&M freshman, followed them 
there with the dispatcher on the phone.

Scene: She was snatched from this downtown block in Dallas on August 15 and forced into her own car. Lewis allegedly drove for more than 30 miles with her captive before he was pulled over by police

The woman was checked by paramedics but was not hurt. Arias said he met her after the rescue and she gave him a hug.

'I would describe it as the best hug I have ever gotten,' he said.

Asked if he considered himself a hero, he said: 'She says we saved her life. I guess you could say we did. But I don't want to be that person who says they're a hero.'

Lewis remains in jail on $50,000 bond. He is charged with aggravated kidnapping.
