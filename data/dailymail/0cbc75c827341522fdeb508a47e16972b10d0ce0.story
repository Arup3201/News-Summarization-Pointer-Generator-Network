On Thursday night in Lausanne, Switzerland, three sprinters broke the 10-second barrier for the 100 metres: Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay and Mike Rodgers. Gatlin’s 9.80secs was the quickest time in the world this year.

It should have been a cause for celebration, but it left only a  sickening, churning feeling. There is little entertainment in watching sport when you do not care about the winner.

All three sprinters, after all, have returned to track and field after serving drugs bans. All three have never said ‘sorry’. They just swanned back into the sport and let their fast times do the talking.

Three cheats: Gatlin, Rodgers and Gay all ran under ten seconds on Thursday after serving drugs bans

Example: Gatlin poses with young fans after setting the fastest time in the world this year

A near-capacity crowd in Lausanne applauded, kids queued for autographs and the world just stood back and watched it happen.

Athletics is so desperate for heroes — particularly in a year in which Usain Bolt has yet to light up a track — that its marquee event has been reduced to a circus. Thursday night was an evening that shamed the sport.

Gatlin was given an eight-year ban that might have been life after failing a second drugs test in 2006, but saw it cut to four years —  giving him ample time to come back and win 100m bronze at London 2012.

He referred only to his ‘indiscretions’, then spoke about his ‘struggles’, ‘stresses’ and the ‘journey’ he has been on. Anyone would think he was the victim, rather than the perpetrator.

Gay adopted a similar tone about his year away from the sport, grassing up anyone he could to receive a back-dated, 12-month ban for testing positive for anabolic steroids three times last June.

Unrepentant: Gatlin has never apologised for his doping offenses which say him banned for four years

VISITED the wonderful Olympic museum in Lausanne, where Britain’s Desiree Henry’s name is etched on the steps after she helped light the flame at London 2012. Henry, now 18, then ran in the Athletissima meeting that evening. There’s Olympic legacy for you.

WATCHED Petra Kvitova’s stunning display to win the Wimbledon singles title, then realised a 55-minute, one-sided final played right into the hands of those who do not think women merit equal prize money. The sport badly needs more rivalries and personalities.

THOUGHT how wonderful it was to hear people casually chatting about cycling thanks to the beautiful pictures from the Tour de France. It’s a sport which can get bogged down with technicalities, but a trip to Yorkshire worked wonders for bringing it back down to earth. Funny, that.

We will probably never know exactly how Gay ‘helped the authorities’ to gain such an apparently lenient sentence, but one thing is for sure: it did not involve accepting any accountability.

Rodgers, too, initially provided ‘inaccurate and misleading testimony’ after testing positive for a banned stimulant in July 2011, before finally ‘accepting full responsibility’ and a nine-month ban that ended conveniently before the 2012 US Olympic trials. Rodgers has since also morphed back into the sport.

The thing that really grates is the utterly brazen, swaggering attitude to such flagrant breaches of the rules.

The return to four-year bans for ‘serious doping offences’ in 2015 should help, but at the moment cheats seem to drift in and out of the sport apparently at will.

They are there in almost every race, with their illegally-won honours scratched out and the dirty dollars in prize money reluctantly handed back, ready to go again without a word of explanation to the world. It stinks.

Hero: Men's sprinting has welcomed cheats back into the fold, perhaps because of a lack of other options

Admiration: Fans will warm to Gatlin and his fellow cheats despite their bans, if they keep running fast

The BBC received 172  complaints after commentator Mark Lawrenson (right) said Switzerland’s Josip Drmic ‘should have put a skirt on’ after a particularly weak shot at goal. I don’t know about sexist, I’d say it was just plain stupid: it’s an absolute hassle attempting to do any kind of sport in a skirt, Lawro.

Athletics is caught in a cycle of self-harm, whereby each positive drugs test drives another nail deep into the  the sport, yet must be exposed to send out a message that cheats will never prosper.

These same cheats are then largely welcomed back with apparently open arms — as long as they keep running quickly.

I am not such an idealist as to suggest nobody deserves a second chance. 

Young, ambitious athletes can make mistakes and more experienced competitors can put their trust in the wrong people, but humility must follow such transgressions.

There must be some acceptance that what they did was wrong. Otherwise, the vital trust between spectator and athlete will continue to be eroded.

VIDEO Gay back from drugs ban

Other way: Chambers, who won the British title again last week, has apologised for his drug use

Reigning British 100m champion Dwain Chambers also served a doping ban, but the sickening feeling that followed Gatlin’s win in Lausanne did not greet the 36-year-old’s victory in Birmingham eight days ago.

The only arrogance left in him is a sprinter’s deep belief in his own ability. He cheated, he was caught, he told the truth and now, more than a decade on, he is still winning and winning clean.

There is something admirable in that.

Yet Chambers is still lumped in with the Gatlins and Gays of this world, the ‘former drugs cheats’ whose deceit continues to rile.

And the really sad thing is we largely let them get away with it.
