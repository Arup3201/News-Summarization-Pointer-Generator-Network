Generations-old family recipes for Brussels sprouts, bread sauce and sausage stuffing could soon be the stuff of Christmas legends.

More people than ever are turning to celebrity chefs for help in the kitchen on 25 December, and cockney family-man Jamie Oliver is proving the most popular choice.

Almost half of British households (47 per cent) will be eschewing granny's roast potatoes this year, instead using cookbooks by popular chefs to create their festive spread.

Jamie Oliver beat off competition in the hunt for the UK's celebrity food inspiration for Christmas 2012, while  Nigella Lawson, right, came second

And Oliver has leapt over fellow foodies Gordon Ramsay, Nigella Lawson - and even former queen of Christmas Delia Smith - claiming one third of all votes for the title of celebrity Christmas chef
of 2012.

The father-of-four took 32 per cent of the vote in a survey by vouchercodes.co.uk, followed by Nigella Lawson with 21 per cent, Delia Smith with 19 per cent and Gordon Ramsay with 12 per cent.

A brave eight per cent of people questioned said they will be attempting to recreate festive dishes invented by molecular gastronomy whizz Heston Blumenthal this year

A brave eight per cent of respondents
said they would even be attempting to recreate the festive dishes of 
molecular gastronomy whizz Heston Blumenthal.

Duncan
Jennings, co-founder of VoucherCodes.co.uk says: 'Celebrity chefs are 
very much part of Christmas these days whether we're following their 
recipes or buying their ranges at the supermarket.

'If you are 
struggling for festive food inspiration, there are lots of great deals 
on celebrity chef books at this time of year so snap one up and you can 
create some delicious Christmas cuisine for your guests.'
