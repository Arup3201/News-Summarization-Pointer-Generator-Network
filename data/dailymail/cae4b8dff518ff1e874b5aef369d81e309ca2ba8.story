A British woman was allegedly sexually assaulted in a lift by a worker at Dubai Airport.

The 24-year-old woman from Glasgow, Scotland, had arrived at the airport and asked a worker for directions, before being instructed to use an elevator.

The worker, a 24-year-old man of Pakistani origin, followed the woman into the elevator and touched her inappropriately once inside, she claims.
