For once the north London spotlight didn't fall on Arsenal this Sunday afternoon.

After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger would have been happy to shun the limelight this time.

Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Spurs loss in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with split responses.

In the end, as arch-rivals Tottenham prepared for their date with destiny at Wembley, the Gunners got their win, courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City.

But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing.

The 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the full story. Everton dominated large spells of this clash - the Emirates Stadium a bag or nerves until Rosicky's last minute goal.

Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win.

Wenger rang the changes following Wednesday's hugely disappointing loss. Vice captain Per Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed following the loss to Monaco and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

For Gabriel, in particular, it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager's first-team plans.

Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays. And it seems Wenger's reached the end of his tether with the German World Cup winner after another disappointing display in midweek.

Alexis Sanchez did not manage to get on the scoresheet for Arsenal but the Chilean was his usual busy self, covering the left wing as the Gunners beat Everton. Click here for more pitch maps and stats in our brilliant match zone. 

Tomas Rosicky had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond Howard in the Everton goal

A strong display from Gabriel against Romelu Lukaku may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside Laurent Koscielny - for the Gunners until at least the end of the season.

But the former Villareal defender nearly fluffed his lines on his big audition in the 18th minute as he failed to deal with a long-ball to allow Lukaku a free run a David Ospina.

Thankfully for the Brazilian, his fellow South American bailed him out with some excellent goalkeeping. It didn't impress the Gunners fans, nor did it his manager who almost saw his central defensive gamble backfire in woeful fashion.

Everton deserved the opening, too, after a confident start at the Emirates.

Left-back Luke Garbutt, 21, on only his second Premier League start had made a bright start, while Muhamed Besic and Ross Barkley were seeing plenty of the ball in midfield.

Arsenal, on the other hand, started lethargically - lacking any vigour or pace in their play.

That was until Giroud missed a guild-edged opportunity to hand Arsenal a 28th-minute advantage.

Having brilliantly escaped the attentions of Phil Jagielka deep inside the penalty area, the Frenchman had time to pick his spot from Alexis Sanchez's cross - but the striker sent his close range header wide.

It was the last thing Giroud needed after his high-profile misses against Monaco on Wednesday.

Supporters didn't get on his back this time, fans responding to by Giroud's wastefulness by chanting his name. 

Francis Coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team-mate before being hit on the face with the ball

Coquelin's face was left in a mess as his nose bled following the second of two incidents during Arsenal's win over Everton

Wenger probably wouldn't have been quite so understanding on the bench, however, having watched the striker, who he has spoke glowingly of in recent weeks, squander yet another chance.

The miss, though, did herald a period of sustained pressure from the home side after their slow start.

However, if Gabriel hadn't produced an excellent last-ditch tackle to deny Lukaku in the 38th minute then the growing sense of optimism would have instantly waned.

The challenge would have made Gabriel feel an awful lot better after his earlier howler. And his mood would have improved further when the Gunners took the lead just a minute later.

So to did Giroud, who put his midweek woes behind him to nip in front of John Stones to flick home Mesut Ozil's corner.

It was the perfect response after the barracking from his own fans during the defeat to Monaco.

Perhaps it was harsh on Everton after a first-half in which, for the most part, they looked comfortable, if not the better side.

Gareth Barry tried, spectacularly, to put the Toffees back on level terms inside five minutes of the restart but sent an acrobatic bicycle kick over the bar.

Everton forward Kevin Mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by Andre Marriner, claiming Oxlade-Chamberlain had handled in the box.

Much like the first-half, Roberto Martinez's side had made a positive start after the break - Garbutt's delivery from dead-balls causing Arsenal's defence problems.

The Everton boss threw on Aaron Lennon in place of Mirallas in search of a leveller. Given his Spurs connections, Lennon was afforded a horrendous ovation from home supporters.

There'd have been more boos in the 65th minute had Ospina not tipped over Lukaku's first-time shot from Barkley's cross as Everton continued to make life uncomfortable for their hosts.

It was even more uncomfortable for Francis Coquelin who was left with a bloody nose following an accidental collision with team-mate Giroud. He would later be replaced after taking a ball full in the face.

Lennon missed a glorious chance to score on his return to the capital, firing straight at Ospina deep inside the area after great work from Seamus Coleman down the right.

The Emirates Stadium was a bag of nerves. Ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent through by Oxlade-Chamberlain but the German's shot was blocked by Jagielka.

Substitute Rosicky, finally, eased tensions in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that took a deflection off Jagielka.
