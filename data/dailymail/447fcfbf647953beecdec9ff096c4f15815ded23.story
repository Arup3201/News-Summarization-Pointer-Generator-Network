Eliot Spitzer had a big night of partying on Monday just hours before filing for divorce from his wife of 26-years, as reports reveal that he was seen at a Manhattan bar with his new girlfriend and friends order rounds of drinks.

Spitzer, 54, and his former campaign aide turned girlfriend Lis Smith, 31, went to a rowdy bar after seeing the Knicks basketball game in Madison Square Garden on Monday night.

'The whole group seemed pretty excited and giddy. When the server came, the ordering was chaotic; they were shouting out ‘sliders,’ ‘wings,’ and each time an order was submitted they were cheering and high-fiving each other,' an unidentified spectator at Brother Jimmy's BBQ reports.

Split: Silda Wall and her husband Eliot Spitzer have both filed for a divorce after 26-years of marriage and they could not come to a suitable arrangement after initially announcing that they wanted an uncontested divorce

'They seemed already drunk and 
ordered vodka, a margarita, and a beer tower, which is four pitchers in 
one container,' the spy told The New York Post.

'They
 were jubilant, joking constantly, high-fiving and really excitable. 
They were drinking and having fun. Eliot seemed so happy, he paid for 
the entire check and tipped 25 percent, before he staggered out around 
12.30am with Lis Smith on his arm.'

Though
 the Knicks had just won the game with just a two point lead, the timing
 of Spitzer's celebration undoubtedly had something to do with his 
impending divorce hearing.

Spitzer
 and his wife Silda Wall filed for divorce on Tuesday and were 
attempting to avoid a bitter battle over the family's millions, but 
apparently that plan went by the wayside as they were not able to strike
 a deal.

According to a
 statement issued before their Tuesday meeting by the estranged couple's
 spokeswoman, Lisa Linden,  'all issues between us have been resolved 
and are uncontested' - meaning they were not planning on engaging in a 
lengthy legal fight.

Infamous: New York Governor Eliot Spitzer (R) announces his resignation as his wife Silda Wall Spitzer stands next to him March 12, 2008 in New York City

The
 divorce announcement comes almost six years after Spitzer, 54, 
announced his resignation as governor with Silda by his side following 
revelations that he had been frequenting prostitutes while in office.

Earlier, court documents labeled the split as 'contested', leading to speculation that Spitzer's well documented affairs with call-girls and the fact that he is a multimillionaire in control of his family's real estate business could be reasons for Silda to seek damages.

However, the statement issued this evening now clarifies that the couple, who have three grown-up daughters, will proceed to end their marriage as amicably as possible.

The legal filing in New York City follows the joint statement the couple made in December announcing that their marriage was over.

This came after the New York Daily News revealed that Spitzer, known as the infamous Client No.9 had begun a romantic relationship with his former press aid, Lis Smith - who worked on his failed bid to be City Comptroller last year.

Indeed, Spitzer was introduced to his new 31-year-old girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub.

Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987.

The couple had three daughters together as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office.

He became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers.

His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resifned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have a prediliction for using prostitutes.

Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side.

He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father Bernard Spitzer - the legendary New York real estate mogul.

Lis Smith had been considered for a senior role within de Blasio's permanent team but those plans were sunk once her relationship with Spitzer became public knowledge

The couple had long been known to be leading separate lives - despite Spitzer maintaining that he and his 56-year-old wife were still together as he attempted to gain election as city comptroller.

However, she never appeared at any event son the campaign trail and one source close to the former governor confirmed to the New York Daily News that they had separated.

The couple released a statement in December to MailOnline after Spitzer, 54, was pictured slipping into the home of 31-year-old Lis Smith, a press secretary who worked on his failed bid for New York City Comptroller.

'We regret that our marital relationship has come to an end and we have agreed not to make any other public statement on this subject,' Spitzer family spokeswoman Lisa Linden said in a terse statement released on Tuesday night.

Multiple reports indicate that the Spitzers have been living apart for some time. Mrs Spitzer was also noticeably absent from the campaign trail this past year.

The couple have three grown daughters together: Elyssa, 23, Sarabeth, 20, and Jenna, 18.

Spitzer and his wife Silda stayed married for five and a half years after the scandal that cratered his meteoric political career.

It's unknown whether the timing of Silda and Eliot's split has anything to do with the his relationship with Miss Smith going public.

A friend of the new couple told MailOnline: 'The relationship began long after Eliot and his wife were living separately and it was not a secret to any of their friends or family.

'It's sad to see lots of outright lies about Lis and her career - Lis is an incredibly smart and dynamic woman who is at the top of her profession and is universally respected.

'She's dealing with this well and is looking forward to getting on with her career and life.'
