Support: The proposal is backed by some of the Prime Minister's closest allies including Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured)

Newly retired workers from a range of different fields will be parachuted in to teach at Britain’s toughest schools under Tory manifesto plans.

Recent retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers, before being fast-tracked into schools in inner cities and other deprived areas.

The Teach Seniors programme will be based on Teach First, which has seen thousands of high-flying graduates heading into the classroom.

It is hoped it will encourage professionals from a broad spectrum of careers to work as teachers before fully retiring, using their experience to educate the next generation.

The proposal is currently being considered by David Cameron and MP Jo Johnson, Boris’s younger brother, who is drafting the Conservatives’ general election manifesto.

It is supported by some of the Prime Minister’s closest allies and is the brainchild of the 2020 Group, which presented the idea to him at Downing Street.

One of those involved in the presentation said: ‘Teach First has seen a lot of talented younger people going into schools before embarking on other careers. This would follow the same logic but in reverse, with people who have already had careers opting to go into the classroom.

‘For example someone who has been working as a chemical engineer might teach science and would have a lot of experience to give to younger people.’

The 2020 Group includes about a quarter of the 305 Tory MPs and promotes ‘a modern progressive Conservatism’.

It is made up of some of Mr Cameron’s most loyal supporters, with Education Secretary Michael Gove among its members.

The group, which was founded by energy and climate change minister Greg Barker, also includes ministers Justine Greening, Helen Grant, David Willetts, Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan and Sajid Javid.

One member said Teach Seniors was one of a ‘whole range of exciting, aspirational and optimistic ideas’ that had been presented for consideration.

Teach First has seen thousands of high-calibre graduates enter the classroom after just a six-week course in teaching.

Founded by former City business consultant Brett Wigdortz in 2002, it takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year with 2:1 degrees or above, who want to avoid the traditional teacher-training path.

Originally aimed solely at secondary schools in London, it has been expanded to include primary schools and now covers ten regions across England and Wales.

Teach First has proved popular with students wanting to try teaching, but has been criticised by unions, which argue that participants do not receive enough training before they are placed in charge of a class.

Before starting in schools, participants attend the Summer Institute, a residential course where they study educational theory and practice.

Trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years, and many sign up to hone skills such as communication, which they believe will help them in future careers in different fields. But more than half stay in teaching and the most successful are fast-tracked into senior roles.
