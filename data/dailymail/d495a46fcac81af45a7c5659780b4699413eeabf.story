If you suffer from Arachnophobia then it is advisable to look away now.

And if you don’t, then you will after watching this horrendous video that features more spiders than your mind could possibly fathom.

The clip, which appears to have been captured in some sort of disused outside cabin, begins by showing three huge clusters of spiders attached to a wall.

The first shot shows the extent of the infestation as thousands of legs run between clusters of spiders

And believe us, the footage doesn’t get any better from here.

Panning around, the camera picks up thousands of legs scurrying about in between ten further spider groupings.

Suddenly as the camera moves in to focus on one of them it falls from the wall causing the spiders that make it up to disperse immediately.

The video maker pans to show five more clusters of spiders and begins focussing on one of them

The video maker films the spiders up-close exiting the cabin and climbing up the door frame

The video maker reacts by turning around and running from the cabin.

Filming the doorway, the camera picks up a large number of spiders exiting and a further two clumps of them fall from the ceiling.

The video maker moves in close once more to record the eight-legged critters running about on the floor before focusing on them on the door and wall.

After filming a cluster of spiders up-close the video maker turns around and runs off in panic as one of them falls from the wall

The final shot shows the sheer extent of spiders inside the cabin, which make the walls look like they are moving

Little information has been released alongside the footage but the skin-crawling footage was recorded in Mexico City, Mexico.
