Most fans are happy when meeting their favourite players, but it was all too much for one Liverpool fan as an encounter with Steven Gerrard left her in tears.

The Liverpool captain was signing autographs while on tour in the US and after posing for a selfie with the supporter she became hysterical, told him 'I love you' and then burst in to tears.

Gerrard then tried to sign autographs for other people but the girl insisted he sign her 'Steven Gerrard' phone as well, at which point she completely lost it.

Her companion did at least see the funny side as they smiled and tried to take her away.

The 34-year-old has history of making fans cry - something similar happened last year on the club's tour of Asia.

Brendan Rodgers' side were training at Princeton University ahead of their pre-season game against Manchester City on Wednesday night.

Liverpool and the Premier League title holders are involved in the International Champions Cup - a pre-season tournament that also includes Inter, AC Milan, Olympiacos, Real Madrid, Roma and Manchester United.

The English side faced Greek champions Olympiacos in their first game, running out 1-0 winners courtesy of an early Raheem Sterling goal.
