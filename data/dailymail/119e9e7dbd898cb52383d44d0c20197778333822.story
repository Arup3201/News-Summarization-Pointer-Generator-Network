Amid the widespread fury and indignation sparked by George Zimmerman's murder acquittal, a 1973 photo of black and white kids embracing on a rain-soaked Detroit street has struck a chord with Americans, instantly becoming a viral sensation.

The now-iconic image was captured by Joseph Crachiola, a photographer working in the 70s for The Macomb Daily.

The black-and-white photo taken on a summer day in 1973 depicts five kids - three of them African-American and two of them white - happily posing for the camera in the middle of the street in the suburb of Mount Clemens.

Crachiola was wandering the streets of Mount Clemens, Mich., when he 
came across (left to right) Rhonda Shelly, 3, Kathy Macool, 7, Lisa 
Shelly, 5, Chris Macool, 9, and Robert Shelly, 6

Four of the older kids are seen embracing, while the smallest of the group, a 3-year-old girl, is standing next to them, nearly obscured by a too-big shopping cart.

Last Sunday, just days after the controversial verdict clearing Zimmerman in the 2011 killing of black unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the 63-year-old photographer dug up the old picture of the grinning children and posted it on his Facebook account, hoping to bring something positive to the heated debate over race relations.

Serendipity: Crachiola (pictured) shot a few frames of the grinning and embracing kids at their request, and he came to cherish the image as one of the most meaningful in his life

'For me, it still stands as one of my most meaningful pictures,’ he wrote in his post. ‘It makes me wonder... At what point do we begin to mistrust one another? When do we begin to judge one another based on gender or race? I have always wondered what happened to these children. I wonder if they are still friends.’

The photo showing a brief moment of racial harmony amid a firestorm of anger and hatred instantly went viral. On Friday, Crachiola wrote on his Facebook page that the vintage picture has drawn 769,000 views. 

By Saturday evening, the image has attracted nearly 19,000 ‘likes’ and just under 10,500 comments.

The Macomb Daily reprinted the photo on its homepage and sent someone to the archives to track down the microfilm in order to identify the kids, whose names were written in the caption.

The subjects, who are now middle-aged, have been identified as two sets of siblings: Rhonda Shelly, 3, Lisa Shelly, 5, and Robert Shelly, 6, and their friends, 7-year-old Kathy Macool and her 9-year-old brother, Chris. 

Like most truly great things in life, the encounter between Crachiola and the siblings was a case of pure serendipity.

On the afternoon of July 31, 1973, the photographer was on assignment in Mount Celemns trying to find a subject for a 'slice of life' essay for the paper.

In his Sunday post that accompanied 
the vintage photos, the 63-year-old Crachiola, who now lives in New 
Orleans, explained that he was walking down Cherry Street when he 
spotted some neighborhood kids at play.

'They saw me and said, "Hey mister, take our picture!" he wrote. ‘The pose was completely spontaneous.’

Crachiola
shot several frames, one of which was later published inside the paper 
and forgotten by most. But for the photographer, seeing the kids 
embracing one another without giving the color of their skin a second 
thought made him wonder: when is innocence lost?

‘At
what point do we begin to mistrust one another? When do we begin to 
judge one another based on gender or race?’ he later wondered on 
Facebook.

Following the heated debate over the 
Zimmerman verdict and seeing images of angry protesters demonstrating 
from coast to coast made the 63-year-old retiree think about the old 
photo of the kids and share it with the world, he told NPR.

And now it appears that a reunion between Crachiola and his young friends may be in order.

In his original post, Crachiola wondered if the children he had depicted were still friends, and what had become of them.

Less than a week later, he started getting answers to his questions. On Wednesday, the retiree emailed Deadline Detroit,
saying that he got a call from Bianca Shelly, the college student 
daughter of Rhonda Shelly – the little girl barely visible behind the 
shopping cart in the vintage print.

Public fury: Protesters rally in Chicago on July 20, 2013 to express anger over a not-guilty verdict in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and call for an end to the Stand Your Ground self-defense laws

Positive message: Amid widespread indignation and outrage, Crachiola's snapshot of racial harmony has struck a chord

Ms Shelly, who attends school in Mississippi, told the photographer that her mom was shocked to see her 3-year-old self staring back at her from a page in the morning paper. 

‘She seemed genuinely moved by the spirit of the picture,’ Crachiola said of Bianca.

Rhonda still lives in Mount Clemens along with her 46-year-old brother Robert. Their 45-year-old sister, Lisa Dianne Roby, lives in Clinton Township.

Crachiola also heard from Robert Shelly’s wife, Darnesha, who joked in a post on his Facebook page: ‘It was great seeing a picture of my husband with hair!’

By Thursday night, the photographer had tracked down 47-year-old Kathy Macool and her 49-year-old brother, Chris, who had learned of the viral photo from another sibling and reached out to the 63-year-old to let him know that the family now live in Texas.
