She has survived three brain haemorrhages, each of which could have killed her.

Despite stunning doctors by cheating death, Ellie Calder continues to live with a ticking timebomb in her head, which threatens to claim her life at any moment.

The 20-year-old suffers from an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a rare mass of abnormal blood vessels, that can haemorrhage at random.

Ellie Calder, 20, has already had three brain haemorrhages and could have another one at any moment

Miss Calder, from Nantwich in Cheshire, was seven years old when she suffered her first brain bleed.

Four years later the second struck, followed by the third haemorrhage when she was 16.

But despite living at risk of suffering a fatal brain bleed at any moment, Miss Calder refuses to let her condition affect her life.

She said: 'Sometimes I can’t quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable.

'A lot of people would have a permanent disability, but I’m fortunate to have no lasting damage.

'The hope is that through the treatment I’m receiving from the incredible people at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, the AVM will shrink and disappear completely.

'It’s amazing to think that one day I might not have to live with this.

'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I’m living with as I’d just scare myself - there’s no point living in fear.

'Thanks to the Walton I live just like any other girl my age - I go to uni, I have friends and an amazing boyfriend - I owe everything to them really.

'I just try not to focus on my condition, and get on with my life.'

An arteriovenous malformation in the brain is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels.

Normally, arteries carry high pressure blood and veins carry lower pressure blood but in an AVM blood is diverted directly from the arteries to the veins.

They can cause brain haemorrhages, seizures, headaches and difficulty with movement, speech and vision.

Brain AVMs occur in less than one per cent of people - they are more common in men than women.

It is not known why they occur but patients are usually born with them.

Treatment options include surgery and radiosurgery.

Miss Calder was just seven years old when she collapsed on Boxing Day, having had her first subarachnoid haemorrhage.

She said: 'I don’t remember much of it as I was so young, but all of a sudden I was totally unable to move my arms and legs.

'I was rushed to hospital, but after a few tests and investigations I was discharged.

'My parents were really worried as they were sure that something more was wrong.'

Four years later, while at school, Ms Calder was struck down with another bleed.

She said: 'I wasn’t really able to comprehend what had happened or the seriousness of the situation.

'But again I remember waking up and not being able to use my legs.

'I was at the Walton Centre for two weeks - at first I was treated with suspected meningitis but then a consultant sent me for a CT scan.

'It was that that they discovered I had an AVM about 5cm by 5cm just millimetres away from my brain stem. It was a shock to everyone - we just had no idea.'

Miss Calder was told that she would be monitored twice a year, and would undergo gamma knife radiosurgery to reduce the size of the AVM.

But the condition struck again the day before Miss Calder's high school prom.

She said: 'I’d had my nails and tan done and was in the shower when I experienced a sudden sharp pain.

Miss Calder (pictured with her stepmother and baby sister) is now hoping doctors will be able to shrink the growth to prevent her having another bleed

'It felt as though someone had hit me on the back of the head with a shovel.

'The next thing I can remember is looking down at my hands and seeing my nails had grown out and my tan was patchy where the tubes and drips were.

'I cried and cried when I realised I’d missed my prom.

'This time I underwent a surgery called endovascular surgery, but I lost the ability to walk or see properly - I couldn’t even do basic things.

'It was like my brain just didn’t want to work properly anymore, and I was warned that in 50 per cent of cases it could be permanent.

'It was pretty terrifying but the Walton Centre staff helped me to walk and see again.

Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, William, and sister, Florence) says the abnormal blood vessels are too close to her brain stem to enable surgeons to operate

Miss Calder said: 'Sometimes I can't quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable'

'Thanks to them I was out of hospital within a few months and starting college - I really owe my life to them.'

Ms Calder's AVM is still present, but so close to her brain stem that it makes open brain surgery impossible.

She continues to be monitored at the Walton Centre, and hopes the radiosurgery will continue to shrink the AVM until it disappears altogether.

She said: 'I try not to let my AVM and what it could do affect me - I’ve known about it from such a young age so I’m used to the idea now and I feel normal.

'The only symptom I get is migraines but it could be a lot worse.

'I can’t go too crazy on the rides at Alton Towers, and I have to be a bit careful if I go on nights out - but apart from that I’m a normal university student.

Miss Calder (pictured with her grandfather) said: 'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I'm living with as I'd just scare myself - there's no point living in fear'

'I just have to stay positive, and one day hope that I can put all this behind.

'I’m fortunate to have an incredible family, boyfriend, and group of friends that keep me positive.'

Consultant neuroradiologist Dr Hans Nahser of The Walton Centre said: 'A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of abnormal connections between arteries and veins.

'They appear in the brain as tangles of blood vessels and are usually diagnosed following a scan after someone feels ill with symptoms such as headaches or a seizure.

'In serious cases the blood vessels can rupture and be the cause of a disastrous bleed in the brain, known as a brain haemorrhage.

'Brain AVMs are still considered to be maldevelopments of cerebral arteries you are born with.

'At The Walton Centre brain AVMs are treated in a range of ways including open neurosurgical operations, endovascular embolisation, stereotactic radiosurgery or a combination of these treatments.

'Endovascular embolisation is a minimally invasive treatment using microcatheters through the arterial system to block of the arteriovenous shunts with special glue.'

Miss Calder is raising money for the Walton Centre who have helped her throughout her treatment.
