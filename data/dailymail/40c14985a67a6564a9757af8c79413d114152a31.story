A 58-year-old woman was crushed to death as she tried to rescue her beloved dog Violet from under a garbage truck in Manhattan this morning.

New York University administrator Jacqueline Haeflinger was walking her Boston Terrier near her West 15th Street home about 10am when the pooch broke off the leash and dashed under the truck.

Witnesses watched in horror as the driver - unaware that Haeflinger was trying to fetch the pooch from the back of the vehicle - reversed over her.

Witness 
Edward Sanders, 50, said the sanitation worker's partner saw Haeflinger,
 a certified life coach, at the last second and screamed for him to 
stop, but it was too late.

'The driver didn’t know she was there. (He) didn’t know he had hit her. He was very upset,' Sanders told New York Daily News. 

'It was a freak accident. She had him on the leash. The dog got loose. She tried to get him.'

Sanders, who was returning home from work on his bike, said he saw the New York City resident get pinned under the truck.

'She was 
trying to reach for her dog. Her dog was running under the truck. But 
unfortunately she slipped and went under the truck and that was a fatal 
accident,' Sanders told Eyewitness News ABC7.

'I called 911 and was trying to get help. But I looked at her and was like, there is no help.'

Anton Zaazoua, 38, said he watched in horror as Haeflinger, whose mother died in March, was struck.

'She saw the truck was stopped,' Zaazoua told New York Daily News.

'She went under it to get the dog. The truck moved. It hit her. You can’t process this. You don’t know how to process this.'

New York Post reported Haeflinger's body lay under the truck for 90 minutes as officers investigated.

The pooch was not injured and is reportedly being cared for by neighbors.

The City of New York Department of Sanitation confirmed the incident in a statement to the New York Post.

'One of our collection trucks was involved in a fatal accident this morning and the investigation is ongoing,' the statement said.

Cops are investigating and no charges have yet been filed.

The news has shocked friends and neighbors, who said Haeflinger, a New York University psychology graduate, had a close bond with Violet.

'I would see her walking the dog every day in the morning and at night,' Jeffrey Purfield, 25, who delivers balloons in the neighborhood, told New York Post

'She was very pleasant, happy and outgoing. She’d say hi and we talked about the weather. You could see she cared a lot about her dog. It seemed like a mutual friendship.

'The dog seemed to be happy and calm. She seemed happy and calm, too. It was always her and her dog. I am not shocked that she went under the truck to get her dog. The dog was like family to her.'

Friend Robert Gioria, 51, told the New York Post: 'I can’t believe this. I had plans with her next week. I am totally numb right now.'
