British diplomats have unveiled their secret weapon in the battle to win over North Korea and bring the impoverished dictatorship into line with more enlightened nations... The Teletubbies.

The children’s television show is among several classic series being considered for export to North Korea, which has little exposure to western culture and is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant Kim Jong-Un.

Foreign Office experts are said to be 
helping BBC Worldwide – the corporation’s commercial arm – choose 
suitable, inoffensive programmes to sell to its state broadcaster.

The children's show Teletubbies has been shown all across the world and could, it is believed, be broadcast in the closed regime of North Korean if a deal is agreed

The
 Teletubbies are in the running because the four characters – Dipsy, 
La-La, Tinky Winky and Po – do not have any dialogue.

If successful, 
such a move could perhaps open the door to shows from other British 
broadcasters, such as ITV’s Mr Bean, starring Rowan Atkinson.

Series
 that reveal something of the British way of life, such as EastEnders or
 The Good Life, would also be suitable choices, a Foreign Office source 
told The Sunday Times.

In a letter to the Commons foreign 
affairs committee, Mr Hague wrote: 'In the long term this is a good way to 
improve understanding about the outside world within such a closed 
society.

'You couldn't send Dad's Army as it is 
about war. But Teletubbies could be an option, or The Good Life, with a 
bit of gardening and squabbling in the kitchen.'

In November, the BBC claimed its science fiction drama Doctor Who became one of the world's biggest TV shows after a special 50th anniversary episode was watched in 94 countries.

The episode was simultaneously screened in 3D to more than half a million people in cinemas across Latin America, North America and Europe.

BBC Worldwide's other top selling shows include Africa, Top Gear and Parade's End.

The foreign affairs committee chairman, Sir Richard Ottaway, said: 'This is a good use of British soft power.'

Sources from BBC Worldwide said negotiations were in the early stages and no shows had been finalised.
