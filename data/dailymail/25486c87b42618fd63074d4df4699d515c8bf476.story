Virgil van Dijk has issued a ringing endorsement of Ronny Deila’s regime.

The Celtic manager made headlines this week as he enforced a stringent approach to fitness and diet.

Seen in some quarters as a criticism of the reign of predecessor Neil Lennon, an unrepentant Deila insisted that any player not buying into his methods would soon be surplus to requirements.

But having helped the Scottish champions move joint top of their Europa League group with a narrow win over Dinamo Zagreb, Dutch defender Van Dijk stressed the squad were prepared to go to any lengths to improve their chances of competing at the highest level.

‘It’s good for us all, it’s not something that makes you worse or anything else. He wants to make us better players and wants to get everything out of us,’ Van Dijk said.

‘I think that’s a good sign. But he is also busy trying to win games and that’s the most important thing in football.’

Asked if the strict diet Deila is imposing was something he’d experienced in Holland, Van Dijk replied: ‘No, but I think if you play at the highest level then you should look into it. If you want to play at the highest level and get everything out of yourself then, of course, you need to do what it takes.

‘Diet and fitness are important. They belong there. But the most important thing is to win games.

‘It’s his (Deila’s) opinion. He’s the gaffer and he wants us to do it. That’s his right and I think it will only make us better human beings and better players.’

The mutual respect between player and manager was apparent again yesterday when Deila described Van Dijk as the ‘perfect defender’.

And he urged the towering centre half to hold fire for a major European club after Celtic resisted offers from Southampton and Sunderland in the last transfer window.

Deila insisted the sky is the limit for his £9million rated Van Dijk and said: ‘Virgil is better now and improves all the time. He looks fit and sharp and for me I hope when he leaves Celtic he goes to a top international club and we’re talking about one that could win the Champions League.

‘I don’t have so much experience of those things, but in my opinion if he gets consistency in his play and is even more disciplined in his structure I can’t see his weaknesses.

‘He’s quick, he’s strong, he’s good on the ball, he’s calm, he reads the play well, he’s good in the air. You name it, he has everything.

‘He is the perfect defender. But he is his own enemy, he has to step up every day and go to training to get even better but I think he is improving all the time.’

Jason Denayer on-loan at Celtic from Manchester City has been called up to the Belgium squad 

Deila is also delighted with Jason Denayer’s call-up to the Belgium squad for the forthcoming Euro 2016 ties with Andorra and Bosnia – and hopes it can help to keep the Manchester City loan star for one more season.

‘You see what it does to have a good environment and work in the right way, this is what you can get out of players,’ he said. ‘It’s something I learn and you learn when you get into a big club.

‘It’s about getting the best out of the players and with Jason we have done that.

‘I hope that we can build him up but also keep him for the Champions League if we win the league and get into the Champions League next year - that he can be an important player in that role as well.

‘We have a very good co-operation with City, there are good bonds there. We talk well together. He is very young still to be playing at this level and if we win the league and go into the Champions League it would be a perfect scenario for him because it is a very high level and he maybe needs a couple of years there. They are happy with what is happening here with him.’
