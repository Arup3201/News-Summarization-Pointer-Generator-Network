A hair salon is trying to make amends after it severely botched a customer's hair.

A hairstylist at Great Clips in Winter Springs, Florida ignored Vyunda Bradshaw's request to skip using clippers on her head and destroyed her hair, Bradshaw told WKMG.

'I said, "You can't use the clippers, you need to use the scissors." She said, "I'm blending."

'She stepped this way and that's when she took my hair off,' Bradshaw told the station.

Upset: Following her experience at Great Clips, Vyunda Bradshaw has been wearing a baseball hat

Unhappy: Bradshaw says her hair has gaps and that a hairstylist ignored what she was saying at the salon

'I attend church regularly, I have a social life, I can't go anywhere with my hair looking like this,' she also said.

Because of the haircut, Bradshaw avoided posing for photographs at her granddaughter's bridal shower, WKMG said.

Following the incident, Great Clips offered several remedies to Bradshaw.

The salon gave her money for a wig, hair products at no cost, proposed free trims at the salon - and the offending hair stylist was fired, the station said.Â 

However, Great Clips reportedly declined Bradshaw's $1,000 request to cover 'pain and suffering' due to the haircut.

'I told [salon manager Michelle Bates] I don't wear wigs, it's 97-degree weather,' Bradshaw told the station. 'With the wig it's going to be 125 degrees and I'm going to pass the heck out.'

'I take pride in my hair,' Bradshaw told WKMG.

'My appearance means a lot to me, but now somebody looks at me they might think I'm a man with my hair all cut off like that.'
