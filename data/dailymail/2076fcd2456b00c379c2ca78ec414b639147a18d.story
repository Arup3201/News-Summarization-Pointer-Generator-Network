A landmark exhibition of rarely-seen treasures from the golden age of Chinese history is to be put on at the British Museum, it was announced today.

The show in London will focus on how China became a superpower in the first half of the 15th century and the wealth of beautiful objects it produced during the Ming dynasty.

Loans will be coming from 10 Chinese institutions and 21 international lenders and the exhibition will feature new research and discoveries from the Far East. According to museum bosses, it is the first time an exhibition of this kind has been attempted.

The show will demonstrate how China was 
undertaking major sea expeditions decades before Christopher Columbus, 
printing books before England had the press, and fighting battles with 
guns when Europe was using bows and arrows.

Curator Jessica Harrison-Hall told the Evening Standard that 
she believed audiences would be dazzled by the treasures from a history 
that was only now being fully understood.

'This is zooming in on 50 particular years when China was becoming a global superpower. It is like our Elizabethan era, it was a golden age. Probably the most beautiful things ever made in China were made at this time,' she said.

The autumn show will include priceless vases of some of the best quality porcelain, silk robes, golden vessels and jewellery, weapons, paintings, furniture and arguably the world’s first encyclopaedia.

The
 Ming Dynasty is one of the most illustrious names amongst the ruling 
dynasties of the Chinese empire - it held sway in China from 1368 to 
1644.

During the period
 China witnessed a vast improvement in techniques to make embroidered 
silks, glazed porcelain, carved lacquer wares and other artworks.

It
 was an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture and 
the artifacts from this era have been held up as some of the most 
influential in art history

This period was also was a time of extraordinary engagement
with the world and of fascinating cultural diversity.

The explorer
Zheng He pioneered China’s maritime history, sending treasure ships
to South East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

China also enjoyed a
period of unprecedented global contacts from Kyoto to Mogadishu,
through trade and diplomacy evidenced through gifts of gold,
silver, paintings, porcelains, weapons, costume and furniture.

Among the portraits is one of Yang 
Hong, an army commander famed for his fortitude. He is pictured in a 
ceremonial military helmet.

The
 exhibits were produced under the four emperors who reigned between 1400
 and 1450 when the Ming dynasty, which began in 1368, consolidated power
 following a civil war.

Although
 there was little contact between China and northern Europe, the 
country’s most intrepid explorer, Zheng He, was leading expeditions to 
south-east Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

At home, the imperial family was 
building the Forbidden City and creating a new court in Beijing. Loans 
for the exhibition are coming from 10 Chinese museums and another 21 
international lenders.

Director
 of the British Museum Neil MacGregor said: 'The political, social and 
cultural changes to China during the first half of the 15th century make
 this a remarkable story which is only now being fully understood.

'New
 discoveries and research have led to a new perspective on this 
significant period that moves away from a Euro-centric view of China's 
history.

'Temporary 
exhibitions of this nature are only possible thanks to external support 
so I am hugely grateful to BP for their longstanding and on-going 
commitment to the British Museum.'

Peter
 Mather, BP's group regional vice president for Europe and head of 
country for the UK, said: 'BP is extremely pleased to support Ming: 50 
years that changed China, the second BP exhibition of the new five year 
partnership with the British Museum.

'BP has had operations in China for more than 30 years and our activities there are a vital component of BP's global portfolio.

'Our
 support for this exhibition is part of BP's wider contribution to UK 
life, enabling people to connect through cultural activities. We are 
delighted to help bring this major exhibition to the British Museum.'

Ming: 50 years that changed China, 
sponsored by BP, will run from September 18 to January 4, 2015, with an 
admission charge of £16.50.
