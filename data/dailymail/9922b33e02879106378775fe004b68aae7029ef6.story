A rugby league player has told how a heavy tackle left him in pain - only to be diagnosed with a broken neck three days later.

Wests Tigers player Keith Lulia walked off the field after picking up what he thought was a minor injury during a game against the North Queensland earlier this month - but now may never play again.

The life changing moment occurred when Lulia was going in to make a cover tackle on Kane Linnett on the night the Tigers experienced a 64-6 annihilation by the Cowboys in Townsville.

Aware of how lucky he is, the utility back is remaining positive about the prospect of ever playing again after his neck broke from the pressure of the top of his head colliding with Linnet’s hip.

'I am trying to stay positive but you never know what is around the corner,'  Lulia told The Daily Telegraph.

'You see players go out there and put their bodies on the line with no protection like they have in NFL. It is a very tough game.'

The doctors informed Lulia of how fortunate he was due to the impact of the collision.

'I was actually very lucky to walk off,' he said.

His neck was sore the day after the clash, which he thought was just muscular, but then Lulia became suspicious a few days later when the pain hadn't alleviated.

'I hadn’t done any running because if I even tried to jog the jolting just gave me a lot of pain,' he said.

'And I couldn’t train anyway without passing the cog test (which players are obliged to take after suffering concussion).

Lulia asked for further tests to be done after he failed the cog test twice.

'So he sent me for a scan and it showed there was a break, a clean break,' he said.

He said he knows how blessed he is to still have movement in his neck.

'I am just lucky that so far there is no nerve damage and hopeful it heals up 100 per cent,' he said.

'It is just the pain I have to deal with at the moment.'
