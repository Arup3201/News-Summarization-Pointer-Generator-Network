In just over a week's time the Olympic Stadium will host the world's top athletes as they bid to become the best of their generation.

But before then, there is the small matter of the £27million Opening Ceremony, which is currently shrouded in secrecy.

However, these images show a rare and revealing glimpse inside the stadium as preparations begin for the event, which is being organised by Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle and will be watched by one billion people around the world.

Traditional: The Olympic Stadium will be transformed into a British rural idyll, complete with real cows, sheep and a horse-drawn plough. Some of those who will take part are pictured

As these pictures show, the stadium 
is being transformed into a British
 rural idyll. Traditional countryside cottages can be seen together with
 a mining wheel, harking back to the country's proud mining industry.

Mimicking scenes across the country 
every weekend, a cricket pitch is also included with some of those taking part in the ceremony pictured practicing a game. Performers were also spotted at the site today wearing costumes which looked like they belong in the Victorian era.

When it comes to the actual event next Friday, the stadium will be packed with 80,000 
spectators, 16,000 athletes, 10,000 performers, 70 sheep, 12 horses, 
ten chickens, three cows, two goats and even dogs and geese.

Despite the preparations now well and truly underway,
 it was revealed today that the security shambles that engulfed London 
2012 has now forced the Opening Ceremony to be slashed by half an hour.

Danny Boyle's spectacle has been cut 
to three hours to ensure the 80,000 fans in the Olympic Stadium do not 
get stranded and left unable get home on Friday, July 27.

The extravaganza was due to finish at
 12.30am but will now end around midnight to allow people enough time to
 get on packed public transport.

Ongoing fears over security also means Games organisers want more time to get the huge crowd  safely out of the Olympic Stadium, a source has said.

Scenes have now been shortened and 
one bike stunt element has been scrapped completely to avoid misery for 
spectators coming to Stratford, east London for the event.

Most elements of the show are still being kept completely secret.00.00-00.30 - The show ends, up to 30 minutes earlier than planned

'The show has been cut because of 
fears that the checkpoints couldn't cope with the huge rush in and out 
of the stadium,' a London 2012 source told The Sun.

'It's not just crowds of fans, 
athletes and performers G4S and our soldiers will have to cope with  - 
it's dozens of live animals as well.

'All will have to be checked and searched before being allowed into the secure area. It's a huge logistical nightmare.'

A London 2012 spokesman told MailOnline: 'Performers are rehearsing sections and transitions to ensure they are as tight as possible. This is normal in any production, whether it be theatre or ceremonies.

'We need to make sure the show comes in on time to make sure spectators can get home on public transport, so we have taken the tough decision to cut a small stunt bike sequence of the show.

'We will be paying contracts in full and giving full credit in the programme. The show is set to finish between 12am and 12.30am.'

They denied that the decision was connected to the G4S security debacle.

It is yet another damning blow for security company G4S, who will be managing the crowd, after thousands of armed forces and police were brought in because they couldn't provide enough staff themselves.

Plans: Danny Boyle, centre, with his model of the Olympic Opening Ceremony that will transform the stadium into a British country idyll - but its length has had to be slashed

Concerns: In yet another embarrassing security problem for G4S the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium will be slashed by 30 minutes to avoid chaos

Incredible: The stadium will be packed with 80,000 spectators, 16,000 athletes, 10,000 performers, 70 sheep, 12 horses, ten chickens, three cows, two goats and even dogs and geese

Yesterday boss Nick Buckles, whose company's share value had plummeted by £400 million, admitted to MPs that their handling of the Olympic contract was a 'humiliating shambles'.

The ceremony will include a cricket match, real horses pulling a plough and 
ducks paddling in a lake.

There will even be an artificial cloud to 
produce rain, to reflect typical British weather.

Performers involved in the event have been sworn to secrecy,
 rehearsals had taken place behind steel fencing and only a handful of 
people were privy to the full details.

But
 as preparations for the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony got 
underway, organisers forgot one crucial detail – there is no roof on the
 Olympic stadium and the entire process was being filmed from above.

Last month, aerial images emerged of a ‘secret’ set design based on BBC soap EastEnders.

Artistic director Mr
Boyle, is still not revealing any more details and said: ‘We
want people to discover it for themselves on the night.

'We want it to 
be a puzzle until the unveiling, so that people can experience it as it 
goes on.’
