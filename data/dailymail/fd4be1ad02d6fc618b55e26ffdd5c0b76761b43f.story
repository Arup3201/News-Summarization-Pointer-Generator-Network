He bills himself as a 'single 6’1” Silicon Valley technology expert and former Navy cadet' with the perfect gene pool to father a child.

Trent Arsenault, 36, of Fremont, California, has been donating his 'organic' sperm to around 75 familes over six years and has fathered 14 children.

But now his free sperm bank is under threat as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is threatening him with a $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.

His babies: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, who regulate sperm banks, has given Mr Arsenault a ‘cease-and-desist order’, claiming he is unlawfully manufacturing human cells

Mr Arsenault was raised in Missouri as the son of an evangelical preacher and tells couples he is of French, German and Irish descent.

‘They contact me because my sperm is fresh, not frozen,’ he told the Silicon Valley Mercury News. ‘It hasn't been quarantined for years.’

This is the first ever case of its kind with a private sperm donor in the U.S. and the FDA claims he did not take precautions to prevent disease spreading.

Couples pick up the sperm from him and then one of the partners is artificially inseminated. They often send him photos of their children.

His website lists his lifestyle details 
and medical history in extraordinary detail - even revealing he broke 
his leg while ice skating aged eight.

Fathered: Mr Arsenault is only helping out childless couples who cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars to a sperm bank to become pregnant, he said

Donor threatened: Mr Arsenault's lawyers in Washington D.C. insist his contractual agreements with recipients make them 'sexually intimate' partners

‘Maybe some of my techie genes will produce one of the next scientists here in Silicon Valley,’ he told the Silicon Valley Mercury News.

Mr Arsenault is only helping out childless couples who cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars to a sperm bank to become pregnant, he said.

He added the only alternative for many of his clients is to ‘go to a bar and have sex with a stranger’. Many couples who use his sperm are lesbians.

‘I'm helping people in need,’ Mr Arsenault, who consumes an organic diet, told the Huffington Post. ‘I'm not running a business here.’

'Upon receiving news of the story, we were sceptical about Arsenault and his project. But after an hour on his website, it became clear that Trent Arsenault is a super human. No seriously, this guy must have been an Eagle Scout'Robin Wilkey, Huffington Post

'Human body parts and tissue are becoming as interchangeable as Legos, prompting cries for, among other things, a legalised kidney market. Is local, organic sperm the next big thing?'Adrian Chen, Gawker

'If a woman wants to get a random stranger to father her child, why should that be anyone else's business? People have gotten tainted sperm going through official sperm banks'Tammerlin Drummond, Silicon Valley Mercury News

'In his defence, how is it any different (or less intimate for that matter) than having sex with a random stranger after a night at the bar?'Erin Sherbert, San Francisco Weekly
