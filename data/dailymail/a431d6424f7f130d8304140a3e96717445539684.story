From Lassie to Toto, dogs have taken starring roles in some of the last century's biggest blockbusters but, unlike their human counterparts, remain relatively anonymous.

Now all that is set to change with the release of Hollywood Dogs, a glossy coffee table book that gives you a closer look at the canine stars of the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s.

Among the famous hounds featured in the book are German Shepherd Rin Tin Tin, who appeared in no fewer than 26 different films, and Asta, the Wire Fox Terrier best known for his role as Skippy.

Also included is Pal, a male Rough Collie Sheepdog, who starred seven Lassie films between 1943 and 1951, as well in the pilot episodes of the TV series, which premiered in 1954.

During his lengthy screen career, Pal also found time to sire Lassie Junior, who took on the role after his father retired, and in turn sired the next Lassie, Spook.

Another famous canine to appear in the lengthy tome is Terry the (female) Cairn Terrier who played the iconic role of Toto in the Wizard of Oz, and also featured in another 15 films, including Bad Little Angel, The Women and The Chocolate Soldier.

But while the most famous canine stars of the era fascinate, equally delightful are the unnamed and unsung doggy heroes pictured with human stars.

Other human stars to appear in the book include Frank Sinatra, who is shown alongside a doggy companion in a publicity shot for his 1957 musical, Pal Joey, and Jean Harlow who poses between two large Old English Sheepdogs.

Extra glamour is provided courtesy of Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn and Jean Simmons, although for once, all eyes are firmly on the pooches at their side.
