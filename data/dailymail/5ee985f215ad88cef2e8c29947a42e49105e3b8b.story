We are seeing the evolution of Lionel Messi in this World Cup. The new version is not as dynamic, but is equally devastating.

He has become more of an old-fashioned playmaker, with everything coming through him. He’s on the prowl, smelling danger, waiting for the opportunity to pounce and to come alive at the point of maximum impact, but  conserving his energy until such an opening presents itself.

He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball. His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina.

Under pressure: Messi has dragged Argentina to the last eight with a string of sensational performances

Assist: Against Switzerland he showed a burst of pace when it mattered to set up Di Maria's goal late on

Is he protecting his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona, or is this more evidence of the new Messi?

He’s been like that in La Liga since Christmas and I wondered if he was protecting himself for the World Cup, but now we are seeing more of the same.

My first thought in the opening games was ‘he’s quiet’, but the more I study his performances, the more I believe he’s in control and waiting for that moment to arrive when he can make a difference.

We have seen him make an impact, with the last-minute winner against Iran, the brilliant run that created the goal against Switzerland - he has still won the man of the match four times in four games and nobody has ever done that before in a World Cup. 

Leader: His team-mates have repeatedly looked to their captain for inspiration at this World Cup

Withdrawn: Messi was subbed off against Nigeria to preserve him for the knockout rounds

With four goals in those four games, he’s carried Argentina to this stage. But we haven’t seen a 90-minute performance like we used to see for Barcelona when Pep Guardiola was manager and Messi was forever on the ball.

People may say he is too young to have to change his game. He is only 26, after all, but playing at the top with that pressure and intensity takes its toll and in terms of games played he’s probably closer to 30.

So we may never see the old Messi again, but we should champion him for changing.

Top of the world: Diego Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986

He is the most important player in his team and, while he has been in the shadow of Diego Maradona, who won the World Cup single-handedly in 1986, Messi can go some way to emulating him if he can take this team to victory in the land of their fierce South American rivals.

His Argentinian attacking colleagues have been, in the main, disappointing. Aguero isn’t fully fit, Higuain has struggled, Lavezzi has shown flashes and, apart from the Messi-inspired winner against Switzerland, Di Maria has failed to show. So Messi has a heavy weight to carry.

Smiling assassin: Messi trains with his Argentina team-mates in Brasilia on Friday

Pablo 
Zabaleta of Manchester City and Argentina said after the game against 
Switzerland that everyone wants to pass to Messi and then watch him work
 his magic, as if his own team-mates are in awe of him. So the change in
 his play is not weakening his standing, nor his output.

Remember
 his performance against City in the Champions League, where he was 
magnificent while barely breaking out of a jog? We are seeing that 
repeated here.

His
 battle with City’s captain Vincent Kompany that night made for 
excellent viewing in the Nou Camp and I hope we see the same today when 
they face Belgium in the quarter-final.

Better than 'God'? If Messi wins the World Cup with Argentina he could surpass the legend of Maradona

Messi will have to come out on top if Argentina are to progress. For many, this is the tournament that will define him.

He has been brilliant so far, but there will be better opponents from now on. How will the new model Messi fare? If he delivers, we will be asking: ‘Where does he stand alongside Pele and Diego Maradona?’

But if this new, remodelled Messi repeats Maradona's fete in Brazil, he will be right on par with his mentor
