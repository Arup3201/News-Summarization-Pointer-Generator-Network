Commuters are being stalked and terrorised by gangs of raccoons.

The creatures have been jumping out of trees at people outside train stations before retreating.

One New York metro stop has been particularly badly hit by a beast known to locals as Ted.

Commuters in New York are being stalked and terrorised by raccoons

The prevalence of raccoon attacks at Marble Station on the Metro-North railroad has forced the local sanitation department to clean up the street in front of the station.

One raccoon victim, Milagros Maldonado, said he had come across a 'huge' raccoon at the station this week.

The 28-year-old told the New York Daily Post: 'I was scared. I started screaming. I don't want this to happen to me again.'

There have also been reports of raccoons and skunk attacks at another subway station, Bedford Park.

Speaking about another raccoon experience last month, Andre Mayes, 40, told the paper: 'It's kind of unnerving.

'If you see six of them coming at you, you don’t know if they’re going to attack somebody.'

A Metro-North spokesman said traps would be set for the raccoons if necessary.
