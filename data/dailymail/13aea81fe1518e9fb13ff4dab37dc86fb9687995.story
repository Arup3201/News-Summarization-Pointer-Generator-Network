More than 550 hot air balloons took to the sky for the world's largest annual ballooning event.

Up to 700,000 people are expected to flock to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the week-long international balloon fiesta, which attracts enthusiasts from 20 countries.

The event opened at the weekend with a mass ascension, in which all the brightly coloured balloons lifted off in waves.

Among the 99 special shape balloons, were Darth Vader, Angry Birds and a giant Snow White, which joined dozens of animals in the sky. 

The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which is now in its 42nd year, was originally launched by 770 KOB Radio to highlights its 50th anniversary.

This year, balloonists from 35 U.S. states are taking part.

One of the most popular events is the Twilight Twinkle. Dozens of balloonists light their propane burners to create a stunning glow throughout the Balloon park.

On Wednesday, The Flight of the Nations will honour the 20 participating countries, as each flies their nation's flag from their balloon.

Although a male-dominated sport, more than 10 per cent of pilots this year are women.

Judy Nakamura, Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta Board Member and pilot, said: 'Balloon
Fiesta provides a unique environment for female pilots from around the 
world to gather, demonstrate our skills, and encourage the many young 
girls and women we meet to join our sport.

'Without a doubt we are privileged to participate in an event that brings so much joy to this community.'

The annual event has grown to become the biggest ballooning event in the world after its launch in 1972.

The
first conference was held at the Coronado Center Shopping Mall and 
attracted 20,000 spectators and balloonists from seven states.

This year more than $90million will be spent at the festival. 

Dale
Lockett, president of the Albuquerque Convention & Visitors Bureau,
said: 'The Balloon Fiesta is a huge boost to both Albuquerque and New 
Mexico's economy and it provides us with a platform to gain 
international exposure.'
