Dressed from head to toe in a Father Christmas outfit, a Palestinian man is shown throwing a tear gas capsule at Israeli security forces today.

The violence was part of a protest against the separation barrier and Jewish settlement construction at Bil'in Village, in Ramallah, in the West Bank of Jerusalem.

Elsewhere, a knife-wielding Palestinian man wounded two Israeli border police officers at the entrance to Jerusalem's Old City. 

The attacker stabbed an officer in the neck and wounded the other at the Lion's Gate in east Jerusalem, before fleeing. 

The stabbing is the latest in a string of Palestinian attacks in recent months against Israelis that have included deadly assaults with guns, knives and vehicles.

The violence on Boxing Day was part of a string of Palestinian attacks in recent months against Israelis 

The violence is largely down to the dispute over the holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and the site of Al Aqsa Mosque. 

Israeli security officials have suggested the attacks are not carried out on the orders of any group or organisation.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has accused President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority of encouraging violence after he urged Muslims to defend the Jerusalem holy site 'by all means.'

Yesterday, a fire bomb left an 11-year old Israeli girl is fighting for her life after it was thrown at her parents' car.

Ayala Shapira, from the settlement of Matan, was hit in the face and suffered third-degree burns on her body after the car was set ablaze, the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported.

'Ayala screamed that her seat belt was stuck,' said her father, Avner Shapira, who was also injured in the attack.

'I yelled at her to get out, and she finally managed. I don't know if she extracted herself, or if the seat belt burned. With the help of God, we were saved.'

Doctors said the girl's recovery will take months, and that she will need facial reconstruction.

Elsewhere, an Israeli hospital in Jerusalem said it was continuing treatment for a Palestinian boy who was wounded this week during a clash between Israeli border police and Palestinian demonstrators.

Five-year-old Mohammed Obeid was returning home from kindergarten when a rubber bullet shot by Israeli police struck him in the face,  grandfather Ibrahim Obeid said.

A police spokeswoman said Palestinians threw fire bombs and fireworks at border police, who responded with 'riot-dispersal means.'   

Palestinians demand the West Bank, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war, as part of their future state and object to the Israeli presence there.
