These fascinating black and white photographs show the state-of-the-art gyms and exercise equipment installed on some of the world’s most famous early 20th century cruise liners including the Titanic. 

From rowing machines and exercise bikes to punchbags and horse-riding simulators, the equipment available to first class passengers was of high quality for the era.

The pictures reveal how passengers had the option to keep fit while on board some of the world’s most prestigious passenger liners including the SS Bermuda Star, RMS Homeric (1922), RMS Franconia (1922), Victoria Motorship and the stricken RMS Titanic.

The Titanic in particular boasted a first class gymnasium, which was open from 9am until midday for women and between 2pm and 6pm for men.

The gym, which was just one of a host of exceptional facilities available to first class passengers alongside squash courts and Turkish baths, was looked after by the cruise liner’s physical educator Thomas McCauley.

He remained in post on the fateful morning of April 15, 1912, when the passenger ship sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.

Titanic boasted a state-of-the-art gym for first class passengers, alongside a host of other luxury facilities including Turkish baths and squash courts. The gym (pictured) was open between 9am and midday for women and 2pm until 6pm for men. Children could visit from 1pm until 3pm

The photographs also show the gym facilities on board other famous cruise liners of the 20th century including the Cunard liner, RMS Franconia. The ship, which departed Liverpool in June 1923 for its maiden voyage, had a popular gym with a variety of equipment (pictured)

Much of the equipment featured was of high quality in the era. Pictured: A woman enjoys exercising on an electric horse-riding simulator in the gym on board the cruise liner SS Bermuda in mid 1920s (left), while a worker stands guard at the gym on the Victoria Motorship in 1930 (right)

Passengers on board the Cunard cruise liner RMS Franconia, many of whom are wearing suits, waistcoats and flatcaps, work out in the gym which featured (from left to right) a cycling machine, climbing frame, punchbag and pull-up bar. The ship was destroyed by a U-boat in 1916

The Titanic's gymnasium featured a host of equipment including a mechanically-worked saddle (pictured). The gym was looked after by the cruise liner’s physical educator Thomas McCauley who remained in post even as the ship sank in the North Atlantic on April 15, 1912

The Titanic was built by Harland & Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland during 1910 and 1911 and departed Southampton, UK, on its maiden voyage in 1912. It sank on April, 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland and a total of 1,522 passengers and crew died

RMS Franconia (pictured) was among the early 20th century cruise liners to feature a gymnasium. The ocean liner was operated by the Cunard Line until 1956, after being launched in Scotland in 1922. The boat's maiden voyage was between Liverpool and New York, U.S. in June 1923
