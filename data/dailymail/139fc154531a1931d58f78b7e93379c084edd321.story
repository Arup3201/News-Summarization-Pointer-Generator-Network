Detectives investigation sexual abuse allegations against Rolf Harris flew to Australia as part of the inquiry, according to a Sydney television network

British police inquiries into sex abuse allegations against entertainer Rolf Harris have stretched to Australia, a Sydney television network claimed today.

Channel Seven said that at least two Scotland Yard detectives flew to Australia in late March as part of their investigations into the allegations against 83-year-old Harris.

Harris has a brother who lives in Australia, but it is not known whether he was questioned.

The news of the international inquiries came as Coronation Street actor Bill Roache was arrested over claims he raped a 15-year-old girl in 1967.

Roache was not held by detectives from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree, which is investigating ‘historic’ sex crimes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Channel Seven said it was not clear whether any formal interviews were conducted while the Harris detectives were in Australia.

The claims of police inquiries in the country were later reported by at least one Australian newspaper chain, quoting the channel.

Sydney's Daily Telegraph said that Scotland Yard would not comment on the investigation.

But the paper said the visit by the detectives was reportedly made two weeks before Mr Harris's identity was made public by a British newspaper.

Harris' lawyers attempted to bar the 
media from reporting on his arrest, but his identity was revealed by 
multiple sources two weeks ago.

Harris has not been charged with any offence and he has strenuously denied allegations of sexual misconduct.

He was arrested in March, but he was released on bail to face further investigations in Britain this month.

Roache and Harris are just the latest in a long string of veteran celebrities to be arrested on suspicion of sex offences allegedly committed over the past few decades.

Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was
 arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, which was 
launched in response to the revelation that entertainer Jimmy Savile had
 molested dozens of young girls before his death in 2011.

Comedian
 Freddie Starr was arrested in November and April,over claims he once 
groped a 14-year-old girl in Savile's dressing room.

Former DJ Dave Lee Travis was arrested in November and March, on suspicion of offences that he says are not related to children.

Jim Davidson, the controversial comedian and TV presenter, was arrested in January in relation to alleged sexual offences. He has denied the allegations.

Publicist Max Clifford was arrested in December and last week was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault. He denies all the allegations against him.

All of these celebrities were arrested under Operation Yewtree, except Roache.
