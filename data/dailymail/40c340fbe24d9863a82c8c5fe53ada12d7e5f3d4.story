A pensioner in his 80s left a mother-of-two with a fractured spine after running her over in his mobility scooter before driving off with a smirk on his face.

Izzy Bright-Roberts, 34, was sipping coffee outside a cafe at Exeter Quay, Devon, with her two young children and a friend when the elderly man ploughed into the tables and chairs they were sat at.

While her friend managed to whisk her children, Dahlia, three months, and Indiana, one, out of harm's way, Ms Bright-Roberts was rammed head on by the vehicle.

Ms Bright-Roberts (pictured with her daughter, Dahlia) was left with a fractured coccyx after being run down by a pensioner in a mobility scooter outside Lutzy's Coffee Shop at Exeter Quay, Devon (above)

She was pinned beneath the scooter's wheels until the smiling driver reversed and drove off - without even apologizing or checking if she was injured.

The mother-of-two was rushed to hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured coccyx, the tailbone at the very base of the spine

She was released after treatment but told to rest and warned she faces six weeks of gruelling pain while the injury heals.

Ms Bright-Roberts, a university worker from Devon, has compared the driver to the eponymous character in 2013 film Bad Grandpa - where actor Johnny Knoxville terrorises a community while disguised as a pensioner.

The mother-of-two faces weeks of painful recovery and is calling for tougher regulation of mobility scooters

She said: 'I was just sat outside the coffee shop with three friends and my two children.

'This old guy, who looked like he was totally out of control, came smashing through the table and chairs at quite a pace.

'He came from nowhere, hit the table I was sat at and knocked me off my chair and ran over me.

'He smiled blankly with glazed eyes as he was running over me. Neither him, or the woman he was with, apologised.

'They just left - it was like a scene from the film Bad Grandpa. 

Ms Bright-Roberts said the pensioner who ran her down reminded her of the eponymous character in 2013 film Bad Grandpa, played by Johnny Knoxville (pictured above, left)

'Had I been holding the baby when he ran over me, it could have been a very different story.'

Police launched a probe into the incident at Lutzy's Coffee Shop at Exeter Quay but decided the elderly culprit had hit her accidentally.

Ms Bright-Roberts is calling for a change in the law so that people who drive mobility scooters must first acquire a license. 

Under current legislation anyone over the age of 14 can use the vehicles - which can reach speeds of 8mph.

Ms Bright-Roberts added: 'I have been left with very painful injuries. He could easily have careered into the river or into a child.

'I think he was out of control and not fit to be driving. He was a menace to himself and to others.'

Lutzy Dias, the manager of the cafe, said she was shocked that the driver simply drove off.

She said: 'I tried to hold the machine to get it off her and eventually he somehow managed to put it in reverse.

'I tried to get the woman he was with to sit down and take a breath so we could assess the situation.

'But the second I turned around they had got up and they went. In my view he was a danger to himself and other people.

'I was in a bit of shock. Fortunately the woman was not holding her baby - I do not even want to think what may have happened if she was.

'They should have had a sense of responsibility and not just left. I know they were in shock as well but they still have a duty to stop and at least make sure she was okay.'

Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'We were called to reports of a collision involving a mobility scooter and a member of the public.

'We spoke to the woman involved and it was determined that it was an accident. As a result we decided the matter was closed and there are no on-going inquires.'
