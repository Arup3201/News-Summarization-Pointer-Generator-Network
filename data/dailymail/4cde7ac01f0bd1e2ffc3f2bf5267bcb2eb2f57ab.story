A new video shows black men and boys summing up America's police force in one word, with 'brutality' being the most popular descriptor.

Forty-five participants aged five to 50 were recruited from the Seattle area for the filmed experiment, staged to coincide with Black History Month.

As the men get older their perception of the police gets increasingly negative. Indeed, an eight-year-old cheerfully uses the word 'helpful' while a 38-year-old interviewee bluntly says 'evil'. 

Speaking out: A new video shows black men and boys summing up America's police force in one word, with 'brutality' being the most popular descriptor

Among the other words that feature are 'brave', 'insane', 'scary' and 'corrupt'.

A 25-year-old man puts a positive spin on the subject.

'My times that I've dealt with the police I've actually received a lot of help,' he says.

But in sharp contrast, a 48-year-old black man starts cursing as he addresses the topic.

'The only way we can get the police to stop chokeholding black people to death is if the police start pretending that black people are really people,' he tells viewers.

Cut media which made the video, said they recruited the volunteers through friends and by posting adverts. 

Experience: As the men get older their perception of the police gets more negative (the man to the left, aged 36, used the word 'crisis' to describe officers while the man to the right, aged 43, used the word 'brutality'

It notes that some of the men in the film actually have relatives who are officers and the piece 'isn't to pass judgement on police.'

A spokesperson from the company added: 'As you watch you can see people have a lot of different experiences. 

'For us, we wanted to explore how the concept of "the police" changes in black men as they get older. 

'I think the most constructive approach to this video is to ask why the word police begins so positively and then gets progressively more negative.'
