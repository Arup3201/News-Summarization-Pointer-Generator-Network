The hellish Christmas Eve shopping crush could soon be a thing of the past.

Britons are turning to their computers rather than the tills to buy gifts, with shoppers intending to spend 12 per cent more on their Christmas shopping this year than last year, with £1 in every £3 to be spent online, according to a survey.

Shoppers intend to do 33 per cent of their Christmas spending on the high street - 20 per cent in individual shops and 13 per cent in department stores.

The study revealed that 30% of shoppers would physically go in to a store and look at a product before ordering it online

The figures suggest more will be spent 
online than on the high street, with 25 per cent set to go to online 
retailers and 9 per cent to eBay or other online auction sites, the 
study for Santander 123 cashback credit card found.

But supermarkets are set to be the biggest beneficiaries of festive spending, with consumers planning to spend 29 per cent of their Christmas budget there.

Each adult intends to spend an average of £175 on presents, a 5 per cent increase on their intended spend last year.

They intend to spend an average of £37 each on Christmas dinner and £59 on other festive food and drink - 41 per cent higher than last year.

The study also revealed that 30 per cent of shoppers would physically go in to a store and look at a product before ordering it online, while 27 per cent would look online before buying in a store.

Two-thirds of those who intend to do some of their Christmas shopping online cited convenience as a key reason

Some 15 per cent will find the lowest price online and use this to negotiate a better price in-store.

Two-thirds of those who intend to do some of their Christmas shopping online cited convenience as a key reason, 59 per cent said they could find the same items for lower prices and 35 per cent said they shopped online for the variety.

Some 22 per cent said they simply did not like shopping on the high street.

Santander Cards chief executive Alan Mathewson said: 'Our findings suggest an increase in consumer confidence over the past 12 months, which is good news for both online retailers and the more traditional high street.

'Shoppers are clearly still looking to get more for their money however, with large numbers of them using a range of techniques such as bartering in-store with prices they have found online, or looking for cashback deals.'
