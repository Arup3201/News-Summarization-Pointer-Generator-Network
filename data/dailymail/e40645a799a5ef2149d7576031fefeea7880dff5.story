University students face a double whammy of financial pain after a major shake-up of tertiary education funding was announced in the federal budget on Tuesday.

From 2016 universities will be allowed to charge what they like while the government's contributions will drop.

The budget changes will affect anyone who accepts a higher education place after Wednesday.

Federal treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia's higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world in his budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday

Students already enrolled at the time of the federal budget won't be affected unless they're still studying at the end of 2020.

The higher education loans program will also become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016, almost $700 less than now.

Their debts will be indexed at a higher rate, capped at 6 per cent, depending on what it costs government to borrow. The changes are tipped to create a budget saving of $3.3 billion.

University students say the Abbott government's 'horror budget' will leave them drowning in debt.

National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor said an entire generation of students will face new barriers to attending universities.

'The deregulation of fees is without a doubt going to leave students with a sharp increase in fees and that will only increase student debt,' Ms Taylor said.

'We're looking at students who will now be forking out hundreds of thousands for degrees. It's very serious – what they're really doing to passing the buck on to students.'

NUS will be protesting across the country in response to the budget on May 21.

Treasurer Joe Hockey said the measures would help improve the quality of university education in Australia.

'Australia should have at least one university in the top 20 in the world, and more in the top 100,' Mr Hockey said while delivering his Budget speech in Canberra on Tuesday.

'The higher education sector is being held back and cannot compete with the best in the world.

'We need to set our sights higher.'

In a small budget sweetener, universities will have to put $1 from every $5 raised from fee hikes into scholarships for disadvantaged students.

Funding will also be expanded to cover the funding of all students taking diploma and sub-bachelor courses.

It's expected expanding places will lead to the government subsidising an extra 80,000 students by 2018 at a cost of $820 million.

However, it will still bank $1.1 billion from cutting an average 20 per cent from student payments.

The Australia's top research institutions and private higher educators were thrilled with the changes.

The higher education loans program will also become less generous, with graduates made to start repaying the loans once they earn $50,638 from mid-2016

ANU vice-chancellor Ian Young, chair of the Group of Eight, said the moves reconciled access and equality and made growth affordable for universities.

The Council of Private Higher Education chief Adrian McComb says the measure delivers everything the sector wants.

The group representing all universities was more circumspect about the changes, saying it was disappointing the likely increase in student fees was being offset by a significant drop in government contributions.

'In combination (with lower indexation) that represents a reduction of around $1.9 billion over the forward estimates,' Universities Australia chief Belinda Robinson told AAP.
