A survey has revealed that many young people distrust Muslims and feel Britain would be better off if there were less of them in the country.

Of the 1,000 young people questioned in a BBC survey, 27 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds said they didn't trust Muslims, while a similar number said Britain would be better off with fewer Muslims.

It also emerged that 60 per cent thought the British public had a negative image of Muslims and 44 per cent said Muslims do not have the same values as the rest of the population.

A total of 16 per cent said they didn't trust Hindus or Sikhs, 15 per cent said they didn't trust Jewish people, while 13 per cent and 12 per cent said they didn't trust Buddhists and Christians respectively.

Those surveyed say Islamophobia in Britain is stoked by terror groups abroad (26 per cent), the media (23 per cent) and UK Muslims involved int terrorist atrocities (21 per cent).

Just three in 10 think Muslims are taking sufficient measures to combat extremism in their communities. However, overall young people are more likely to agree (48 per cent) than disagree (27 per cent) that Islam is a peaceful religion.

Akeela Ahmed, from the Cross-government Working Group on Anti-Muslim Hatred, said young people must mix with Muslims more in order to dispel their prejudices.

He said: 'These findings indicate that we need to ensure young people are mixing at local levels and that they're working on projects together so that people can get to know Muslims and vice versa.'

Fellow group member Professor Matthew Goodwin added: 'Every survey that I have run, and surveys run by my academic colleagues, makes it quite clear that a significant proportion of the British population hold negative views of Islam, and by extension British Muslim communities.'

The Government group blames negative media coverage of Muslims for stoking anti-Islam sentiment.

The Metropolitan Police released figues in August that suggest there has been a 61 per cent rise in anti-Muslim crime, such as attacks on mosques, in London over the past year.

There are also claims the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in May has fuelled anti-Muslim sentiment.

The Muslim Council of Britain called the rise in violence since the 25-year-old's death.'unprecedented'

Muslim Anisha Patel was recently attacked by two men who pulled off her daughter's veil.

She said: 'The kind of comments, the kind of looks and stares that we're experiencing at this moment in time is very different to what it was before,' she said.

'They've become much more hostile, much more bitter, and much more aggressive in nature. It's actually got to the stage where I'm beginning to feel that I want to stay in my house.'

A 20-year-old woman who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she fears and dislikes Muslims.

'When you hear about terrorism, more often than not it is Muslims that have carried it out. I just feel they're all out to do that, they're all the same,' she said.

Young people are also divided over whether or not immigration is good for Britain overall. Two-fifths say it is a good thing but more than a third disagree.
