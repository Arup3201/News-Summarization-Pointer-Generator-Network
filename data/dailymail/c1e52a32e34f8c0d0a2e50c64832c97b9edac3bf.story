What. A. Finish.

No more than 18 seconds after Valon Behrami produced a brilliant tackle to prevent Michael Arroyo from scoring a last gasp winner for Ecuador, Haris Seferovic was slotting home a winner for Switzerland with virtually the last kick of the game.

The World Cup has been quite a spectacle so far - but it'll take something to beat this dramatic ending in Brasilia.

Heartbreaking for Ecuador, heartwarming for the Swiss - exhilarating for the neutral.

Understandably, the South American's 
looked far more comfortable in the Brazilian heat during the opening 
stages - but it was Ottmar Hitzfeld's side that had the first sniff of a
 chance in the 12th minute, Jorge Guagua making an excellent sliding 
tackle to stop Josip Drmic.

The
 Swiss threatened again four minutes later when star man Xherdan Shaqiri
 collected Gokhan Inler's pass on the edge of the box before firing a 
low drive straight at keeper Alexander Dominguez.

The
 Ecuador shot-stopper didn't look so comfortable, however, two minutes 
later as he spilled Ricardo Rodriguez's long-range effort out for a 
corner.

But just as Switzerland felt they had a foothold in the game, they were outdone by Valencia.

Not, the Valencia you may have thought, though.

Enner
 Valencia, who was inexplicably left unmarked, planted a firm header 
past Diego Benaglio from Walter Ayovi's brilliant free-kick to put 
Ecuador ahead and score in his fifth consecutive international match.

The travelling Ecuadorians were in ecstatic.

Hitzfeld,
 though, was furious with his back-four - namely former Arsenal man 
Johan Djourou - for their feeble attempt at defending Ayovi's set-piece.

His side's response, though, would have brightened his mood.

Super sub: Mehmedi had been on the pitch for just 121 seconds before his header

Comradery: The Swiss team celebrate together after that leveller in the second half

Former
 West Ham midfielder Valon Behrami saw a downward header from Shaqiri's 
corner well-saved by the Dominguez in the 34th minute before the keeper 
got the slightest of touches to stop Inler's angled drive.

And two minutes after the break, Switzerland were rewarded for their dogged response as they pulled themselves level.

Admir
 Mehmedi, on at half-time in place of the ineffective Valentin Stocker, 
was the hero as he headed home Rodriguez's corner in a goal not too 
dissimilar to Ecuador's opener.

If
 Hitzfeld was angry at the way his side defended the set-piece leading 
to Valencia's opener, then Ecuador boss Reinaldo Rueda knew the feeling 
given the South American's half-hearted attempts to deal with 
Rodriguez's corner.

But like his opposite number, Rueda's displeasure would have been tempered by the way his side replied.

Slack marking: Enner Valencia put the South American side into a shock lead in the first-half

No chance: Unlike Ecuador's keeper, Diego Benaglio could do nothing about that World Cup opener

Unlucky: Josip Drmic's strike was disallowed for offside in the second half in Brasilia

Star men: But things didn't quite go as planned for Valon Behrami and Xherdan Shaqiri of Switzerland

Carlos
 Gruezo fired well over the bar following good work from Manchester 
United winger Antonio Valencia and Jefferson Montero in 57th minute.

Moments
 later goalscorer Valencia went close to doubling his tally with a shot 
from the edge of the box following a dangerous run, before Benaglio 
turned an effort from the sprightly Montero round the post.

However, the Ecuadorians' hearts were in their mouths in the 69th minute when Drmic thought he'd given Switzerland.

Shaqiri's
 clever dummy rolled through to the Bayer Leverkusen striker to slot 
home from close range only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.

The Swiss were perplexed, they'll be even more confused when they see replays showing Drmic to be onside.

Benaglio
 nearly compounded his side's frustrations when his error let in Enner 
Valencia in the 74th minute, but the keeper's blushes were saved by 
team-mate Steve von Bergen.

Ecuador
 midfielder Arroyo saw his deflected free-kick saved by Benaglio in the 
final five minutes as the clash looked to be heading for the first draw 
of the tournament before disaster struck for the South Americans.

In
 the final minute of stoppage time, Behrami produced a breathtaking last
 ditch tackle to deny Arroyo after Antonio Valencia's excellent 
cut-back.

And somehow, less 
than 20 seconds later, the Swiss were celebrating after Seferovic 
slotted home Rodriguez's low cross after the Swiss' rapid breakaway.

Wow.
