Jane Pauley, the former co-anchor of the 'Today' show, is trading NBC for CBS.

Pauley, 63, is moving to CBS where will contribute stories to the network's 'CBS Sunday Morning.'

Jane Pauley in 1989, the last year she was an anchor on NBC's 'Today' show before leaving the program to start a new prime-time program for the network

‘We’re really, we’re really really happy to have you,' Schieffer said, according to a transcript provided by CBS News. 'And I can’t think of a better place for you to tell a story. Because you’re a great storyteller – and Sunday Morning is one of my favorite, favorite broadcasts.'

Pauley co-hosted 'Today' from 1976 to 1989. She had been with NBC for 40 years.

Pauley started her career at CBS as a news anchor at a network affiliate in Indianapolis in 1972.

'CBS is the reason I had a 40-year career at NBC," Pauley said, according to the Daily News. 'So if it weren't for that CBS Saturday night lineup that I followed, I would never have had a career in network television. So I've kind of come back home.'

A date when Pauley will start on 'CBA Sunday Morning' has not yet been determined.
