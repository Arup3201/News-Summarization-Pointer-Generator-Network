A grieving mother-of-three lost eight stone after her brother died from a heart attack at the age of just 39.

Natalie Jones, 37, from Birmingham, weighed 19st 8lbs and was a size 24 when her brother Mark died suddenly of coronary heart disease. 

She said: 'Mark was a big man and he loved his food. He had a huge appetite and really enjoyed tucking into big portions.

'He was a smoker too and I believe his unhealthy lifestyle contributed to his heart attack. We have no history of heart disease in our family.

'Mark was great to his family. He worked so hard to support his four children and he loved them so much. It broke my heart to think he wouldn't be around to see them grow up. 

'I didn't want to leave my three children without a mum - I knew I had to do something.'

Shortly after her brother's death size 24 Natalie, who is mother to Jack, three, Sam, 13, and Cole, 14, was tested by her doctor after a routine examination revealed a suspected heart murmur. 

She was terrified by the discovery but was relieved when an echocardiogram revealed her heart was in fact in good health. 

However, at 19st 8lb, she remained at high risk of developing heart problems in the future.

She said visions of Mark's death, which occurred in June 2012, spurred her on to break old habits. 

Determined to head off a similar fate, she began regularly attending a local gym and, in the course of 15 months, lost an incredible eight stone. 

She said: 'I used to be naturally lazy. If I could get away with not doing something, I wouldn't do it. The exercise was torture at first - I could barely manage two minutes on the treadmill. 

'I knew I had to keep going for the sake of my kids.

'I also had an image of Mark dying at the roadside - in a place he didn't know, surrounded mostly by strangers. 

'He had been on the way to hospital when he had his heart attack. He was with his wife who was driving their car. But they never got there. His wife was forced to pull over and a couple of passing policemen came to their aid, but it was too late.

'I was horrified by the thought of dying in a place like that. Going to the gym, and putting effort into physical exercise, was a way of fighting back that fear.' 

She also radically changed her eating habits. 

She said: 'I couldn't bare to give up junk food completely, so concentrated on cutting down. Instead of eating a whole chocolate bar, I'd limit myself to small squares. 

'I was so happy when it worked. In just over a month, I lost a stone. I found that as I exercised, I increasingly enjoyed eating healthily.' 

Natalie was supported in her weight loss challenge by her fiance Craig Groves, 39, who works in industrial design.

Soon she was jogging for 15 minutes at a time and, in August this year, she ran her first 5k race. 

In September Natalie stepped on the scales to discover she had reached her target weight of 11 stone. She had shed just over eight stone since she began her weight loss regime in June 2012.

Her new slimmer body leaves her at significantly less risk of developing heart disease. 

She said: 'I'm still grieving for Mark and it hurts every day that he isn't here. 

'I wonder whether it sounds terrible to say so, but something good came from his death. It forced me to change my life. Nothing's been the same since. 

'I think he would be proud of what I've achieved.'
