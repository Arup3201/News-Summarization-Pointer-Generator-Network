For months, Jodi Arias was a television staple and practically every minute of her murder trial was broadcast live.

But Arias has vanished from view since her trial ended in May, and the judge has done a complete about-face.

She has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far.

New venture: Convicted killer Jodi Arias has launched a book club from behind bars and is sharing her reviews

Attorney David Bodney represents 
several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case. He says 
there have been repeated violations of the public's constitutional right
to attend proceedings in the case.

Arias, 33, admitted she killed her 
boyfriend in 2008 at his suburban Phoenix home but claimed it was 
self-defense. Travis Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, had his 
throat slit and was shot in the forehead in what prosecutors argued was a
jealous rage.

Although she was convicted of murder in May, but the jury couldn't reach a verdict on her sentence. Prosecutors are now pursuing a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to get the death penalty. No date for a new trial has been set.

Judge Sherry Stephens has held hearing
after hearing behind closed doors as the next steps of the case unfold 
almost entirely under a shroud of secrecy. Over the last several months,
she has heard arguments over sequestering the new jury, moving the case
out of Phoenix, Arias' desire to fire her lead attorney and allowing 
live television coverage of the retrial, among other issues.

She
has denied each request, but quietly with orders released days after 
the secret hearings as the case languishes without public scrutiny even 
as Arias' legal tab is being picked up by taxpayers at a cost exceeding 
$1.7 million. Meanwhile, in yet another element of secrecy, Maricopa 
County Attorney Bill Montgomery has refused to provide a tally of how 
much it has cost to prosecute the case, including paying for expert 
witnesses throughout the five-month trial.

Stephens
allowed virtually unfettered access to the first trial, which was 
broadcast live and became to fans like a real-life soap opera as they 
traveled from around the country to get in the courtroom.

She
now says the hearing closures are intended to protect Arias' right to 
an impartial jury, but Bondey says the judge has gone to the extreme, 
often simply locking the courtroom doors without issuing an order as to 
why, in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

Out of the spotlight: Unlike the original trial in May, the new sentencing trial of Jodi Arias won't be broadcast on national television

'The
public is deprived of its First Amendment right to attend criminal 
proceedings,' Bodney said. 'The public has a right to be heard before 
they're just locked out.' The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 
guarantees such basic rights as freedom of speech and the press.

Even arguments by attorneys over media access to proceedings in the case have been closed to the media.

An
irony not lost on Bodney is that the intense media interest in the case
has largely evolved from Arias' own actions by courting interviews and 
operating a Twitter account and selling her artwork from behind bars 
through a third party. She regularly posts inspirational quotes, links 
to purchase her drawings and solicitations for donations for her 
appeals.

A clerk for 
Stephens said the judge could not comment on an ongoing case. Defense 
lawyer Kirk Nurmi has not returned telephone messages.

While all the requests to close hearings have come from defense attorneys, prosecutors haven't objected.

Life or death? Arias is still awaiting a second trial after jurors couldnÂ¿t come to a decision on whether or not she should receive the death penalty for the 2008 murder of her boyfriend

'It's
a balance, but I believe when push comes to shove, a defendant's right 
to a fair trial is probably going to trump what otherwise is considered 
the public's right to attend trial,' Montgomery said.

Phoenix
defense lawyer Mel McDonald, a former Maricopa County judge and federal
prosecutor, said the judge likely never expected the Arias case would 
attract such publicity and is now trying to dial back access to protect 
the record for inevitable appeals.

'The
more that comes out, the harder it's going to be to find an impartial 
jury and the greater the risk of prejudice and error,' McDonald said.

Bodney doesn't buy it.

He
said the judge's decision to ban live television coverage and the use 
of all electronic devices, meaning reporters won't be able to provide 
real-time updates via Twitter as occurred during the first trial, is a 'severe overcorrection' that will 'deprive the public a lens into the 
concluding chapter of this trial.'
