A audio recording recounting an alleged massacre of German prisoners and Papua New Guinea villagers during the First World War by Australian troops has been uncovered.

The recording, of a village elder in the 1960s, may confirm long-standing rumours of a mass execution of German and Papua New Guinea prisoners during the Battle of Bitapaka on September 11, 1914.

The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force were sent to what was then German New Guinea - now part of PNG - to destroy a German telegraph station exactly 100 years today.

The rumours of Australia's war crimes have been circulating for years but has only now been seemingly confirmed through a newly emerged tape recording of an alleged witness, the ABC reports.

The elder claims he saw Australian troops land near his village of Kabakaul - southeast of Rabaul in East New Britain province of PNG - further witnessed the execution of two white men and a number of native police.

The man on the tape is identified as 'Old Bob' and speaks in the Tok Pisin language. 

'A big man of war said "fire" and they all died,' Bob said.

'They shot all the men who were lined up on one side. Only one boy was alright, a young boy such as this, he ran away. So they all died and the trench they dug was full with dead bodies.'

It is believed the audio was recorded in the 1960s by plantation owner  Ian Purvis, who was living near Rabaul.

His wife Irene found the tapes when she went through her husband's belongings after he died. 

Old Bob told Purvis in the interview that he saw the Diggers trick the Germans by telling them the war had ended.

Two days after Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, the British government requested Australia and New Zealand deal with Germany's Pacific colonies.

This was principally so they could not be used to support the roaming German East Asia cruiser squadron.

The Australian Naval and Military Expedition - comprising a brand new infantry battalion of 1000 men, 500 naval reservists and former sailors plus 500 Queensland militia - landed at Kabakaul on September 11.

Thirty PNG policemen, a German and six Australian soldiers were officially listed as killed.
