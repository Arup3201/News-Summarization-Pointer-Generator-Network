Agnetha Faltskog and husband Bjorn Ulvaeus in 1978

Our Eurovision Song Contest acts over recent years have suffered the ignominy of propping up the table and even scoring the dreaded ‘nul points’.

But according to Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeus, the UK could triumph in the competition once again – if we just came up with a decent song.

Bjorn, who co-wrote his band’s 1974 winning entry Waterloo, said: ‘I still like to think that the best song wins.’

He also urged the country’s best songwriters to get behind the contest and ignore the ‘stigma’ associated with it.

The UK has not won Eurovision since 1997 when Katrina and the Waves triumphed with Love Shine A Light.

Rock veteran Bonnie Tyler had to settle for 19th place last year with her song Believe In Me, and our worst result was  in 2003 when Jemini failed  to record a single point.

Unknown Molly Smitten-Downes will be flying the flag at this year’s contest in Copenhagen  on May 10.

Sir Terry Wogan, who presented the TV coverage of the event for nearly 30 years, dismissed claims that the UK was doomed to fail because of partisan voting by East European countries and said all the UK needed was a chart-topping act to take part. 

‘If we could put Take That on stage, we would have an outstanding chance,’ he said.

Bjorn (right) says that 'the best song wins' and that the UK needs to find their best songwriters to stand a chance
