Three police officers have been pulled from street duty for their safety in Southern California after a video of them shooting a dog dead as they arrested its owner hit the internet.

A cellphone video that had more than 3.7
 million views on YouTube by Thursday morning shows the dog, named Max, 
being shot after scrambling out of a car's back seat through a window 
and lunging at officers who had handcuffed its master.

The dog's owner Leon Rosby had been filming a police raid in Hawthrone California, and was arrested for alleged obstruction of justice.

Dog shot by police: A Rottweiler was shot by a police officer in Hawthorne, California when he jumped out of a car and ran towards his owner, who was being arrested

Witnesses can be heard crying out in distress after watching the dog's grisly death.

Hawthorne
 police spokesman Lt. Scott Swain told the Daily Breeze the decision is 
for the officers' safety after the uniformed officer shot the dog four 
times on Sunday.

Numerous death threats have been directed at the officers.

Mr
 Rosby, said police needlessly killed his dog. His lawyer, Michael 
Gulden, said Rosby's complaint will be added to an existing lawsuit 
Rosby has against police.

'I understand that people have been affected by this video. Anyone would be,' Swain told the Breeze. 'The police officers involved are affected by this incident and having to kill a dog.

"I
 don't understand how it translates into an eye for an eye: `We are 
going to kill you and your family because of this incident,'" he said of
 the threats to the officers.

Chief
 Robert Fager has called for calm and urged people to be patient as 
police investigate the shooting, and also avoid information being 
circulated through social media because "fallacies are being 
perpetuated."

Officers in the field have been told to be vigilant against any possible retaliation.

"You'd
 like to believe that maybe some of the people are just venting, but 
then you've got to be realistic. There are crazy people out there," 
Swain said.

The
 130-pound, 3-year-old Rottweiler named Max was shot to death after he 
escaped through a window in a parked car and ran over to his master, 
Leon Rosby, who was being arrested for filming the scene on his phone. 

The video (watch original on YouTube) shows Rosby, 52, walking his dog Sunday around 7 p.m. near a house with several police squad cars parked outside.

He is seen filming the scene in order 'to make sure nobody's civil rights were being violated,' he told DailyBreeze.com.

Rosby is then seen talking to a pair of police officers in the distance. 

Hawthorne Police Lt Scott Swain said that officers were warning Rosby to turn down the music in his car.

'It's distracting the officers. It's interfering with what they are able to hear,' Lt Swain said earlier this week. 'It's not just a party call. It's an armed robbery call. The officers need to hear what's going on with the people being called out of the residence. That music in his car is bleeding over and it's distracting them.'

A neighbor who witnessed the event said they heard Rosby yell 'It's my (expletive) radio!' to officers.

But Rosby said that didn't happen because as a Christian he doesn't swear.

'I do apologize if I didn't immediately comply,' Rosby said. 'The music may have been a little loud but I was complying.'

Leaving: Police are seen approaching Rosby as he puts Max in the car, where the windows are rolled down

Eventually the two officers start 
walking towards Rosby, who puts Max into his car where the windows are 
rolled down. Rosby seems to calmly walk over to the officers and turn 
around, volunteering himself for arrest.

As the officers put handcuffs on Rosby, the dog starts barking and manages to jump out of the car. Another police officer comes over and looks like he's trying to grab the leash when the dog jumps up and the officer shoots him several times.

Escape: Max beings to bark as his owner is walked towards the squad cars, and he manages to squeeze out the windows

Attack? Another officer comes over and seems to reach for the dog's leash when Max jumps - that's when the shooting starts

Dead: The officer continues to shoot the dog several times. A police spokesman says they were protecting Rosby too

'He literally killed my puppy I had since he was 6 weeks old,' Rosby said.

In the video, Rosby is noticeably upset.

'I was crying and hollering, "My dog! Max! Max!"'

Rosby doesn't understand why police didn't let him go to properly secure his dog, or why they continued to arrest him after he put the dog in the car - a sign that he was leaving.

'There was no way Max should have died like that,' Rosby said. 'Max was only protecting his master. He was trying to stop them from beating on me.'

'All he did was love me,' he added.

Lt Swain, however, alleges that the officers were also looking out for Rosby.

'I know it's the dog's master, and more than likely not going to attack him, (but) we've got a guy handcuffed that's kind of defenseless. We have a duty to defend him too,' Swain said.

Rosby was held overnight in jail on suspicion of obstruction of justice and released at 5 AM the next day.

Rosby says that police would not return his dog's body to him.

His attorney Michael Gulden says that Rosby is planning on filing a lawsuit against the Hawthorne Police Department.

Apparently this isn't the first time that Rosby has had issues with the local police. His prior record includes convictions for resisting arrest, battery and driving under the influence. Rosby, a black man, has filed six complaints alleging mistreatment and racial profiling by the Hawthorn Police.

'There's been a pattern of harassment against him and other African-Americans in Hawthorne. Last July, the police responded to his home and beat him unnecessarily, then threw him in jail for no reason. We sued for that. We'll amend that complaint to include the dog incident,' Gulden said.

As of Monday night, the video had 510 views and almost 400 comments.
