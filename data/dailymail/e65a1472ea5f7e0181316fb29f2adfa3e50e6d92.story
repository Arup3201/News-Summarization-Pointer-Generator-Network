'Belittled': Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, hanged herself in her room at Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire, after being off sick with stress

A woman soldier who was struggling to cope with working 80-hour weeks hanged herself, an inquest heard yesterday.

Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement told friends and family that she was called in for duty on her weekends off and even when she was signed off on sick leave.

The 30-year-old said she was belittled and slated by senior colleagues for her work, with one even writing criticisms on Facebook.

Royal Military Policewoman Ellement was found hanged on a fire escape on October 9 last year at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, Wiltshire, shortly after returning from sick leave.

Her death came after she learned on Facebook that an ex-boyfriend had started seeing someone else. Police found the words ‘I’m sorry’ scrawled in lipstick on her bedroom mirror.

An inquest in Salisbury heard that Corporal Ellement, who was from Bournemouth, had always wanted to be in the Army and had joined the Royal Military Police in November 2006. She served in Northern Ireland and Germany before being posted to Bulford Camp after making an allegation of rape against two male colleagues.

She served with 158 Provost Company and was described as a ‘competent’ investigator who was finding her role as shift commander a ‘challenge’.

Corporal Ellement’s father, Kenneth, told the coroner his daughter was working 80-hour weeks and had ‘welfare problems’. ‘Recently she told me she had five days off with stress and in the last month she was doing an acting staff sergeant job,’ he said.

However, her family did not detect any problems as she celebrated her 30th birthday with them days before her death.

'Pressure': The corporal had been criticised by colleagues on Facebook and had discovered her ex was seeing someone new

Lance Corporal Rachel Percival said her friend had spoken of work colleagues ‘making her life hell’ and ‘belittling’ her.

She said Corporal Ellement felt she 
‘wasn’t good enough’. ‘No matter what she did, it was wrong.’ Lance 
Corporal Percival recalled three occasions when her friend was called by
 work while on sick leave.

Lance Corporal Rebecca Joseph added that Corporal Ellement was on the receiving end of a lot of stick but that ‘she gave as good as she got’.

In September last year military medics signed Corporal Ellement off sick with stress.

Before leaving she was interviewed by Captain Sean Kimber, who at that time was second in command of her company.

He told the hearing that she told him she felt she was struggling in her role as shift commander and was uncomfortable working under her staff sergeant.

He said: ‘Anne-Marie wasn’t failing in her duty as shift commander. She found it a challenge. It was that transitional period of going from being an investigator and looking after just your own work, to a supervisor role.’

Captain Kimber said he would not advocate anybody working 80 hours a week nor would he stand for the Facebook slating that Corporal Ellement’s family said she received.

On the afternoon of Corporal Ellement’s death, friends described seeing her sitting on the fire escape appearing tearful.

One heard her exclaim ‘****ing men’. In the early evening she was found hanging by a purple scarf.

Ian Singleton, assistant deputy coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, recorded a verdict that Corporal Ellement took her own life.

Her family declined to comment after the hearing.
