No time behind bars: Austin Clem will not go to prison despite being convicted of three counts of rape dating back to when his victim was only 14-years-old

An Alabama man will not go to prison despite being convicted of three counts of rape dating back to when his victim was only 14-years-old.

Austin Clem, 25, raped the young girl three times between the ages of 14 and 18-years-old and will spend two years in a reform program and three years on probation instead of being locked up.

Mr Clem will also have to register as a sex offender, but the slap on the wrist outraged many in the courtroom.

‘This isn't legal. It's not a legal sentence,’ Ms Andrews, now 20, told AL.com DA Jim Ayers jumped up in court and said.

Mr Clem was convicted of one count of first-degree rape for the most recent incident two years ago, and two counts of second-degree rape for the two encounters when she was just 14-years-old.

Sentencing guidelines provide for sentences anywhere from 10 to 99 years in prison, but Mr Clem will never see the inside of a cell.

‘My family was very relieved to hear the three guilty verdicts,’ Courtney’s father Richard Andrews told AL.com. ‘We were floored to hear the judge hand down such a light sentence.’

The convicted rapist will instead spend 
two years in a reform program administered by the county jail, but 
intended to keep non-violent offenders out of prison.

Victim: Courtney Andrews has taken the unconventional step of publicly identifying herself and slamming her attacker's sentence

‘Participation and successful completion in this program will offer offenders the opportunity, incentive and the means to correct behaviors and to appreciate consequences,’ according to the program’s website.

Upon completion of the program, Mr Clem will spend three years on supervised probation. The married father must also register as a sex offender.

Explaining that she was ‘livid,’ Ms Andrews recalled to the site ‘I thought, 'How is this even possible?’

Mr Clem’s attorney defended the sentencing in an interview with Mother Jones.

‘It would seem to be relatively mild,’ Dan Totten told the site. ‘But [Clem's] lifestyle for the next six years is going to be very controlled.’

Some of the hardships Mr Clem will face include not being able to drink alcohol at parties or cross state lines to buy lottery tickets, the attorney explained.

Ms Andrews, though, is concerned for the safety of both herself and her family, she told AL.com.

‘I moved to get as far away as possible from him,’ she said. Ms Andrews is currently enrolled at the University of South Alabama, according to her Facebook page.

She also fears for the perverts young children.

‘The judge still chooses to send him home to his three little girls,’ said Ms Andrews. ‘I don't understand that. I can't fathom that.’

Mr Clem has also been ordered to stay away from his victim and her family, as well as pay just over $1,600 in restitution, according to sentencing documents reviewed by MailOnline.

Authorities have told Mother Jones they are looking at all possible avenues to ‘achieve a sentence that gives justice to our victim.’
