It may come as a shock to those fond of quoting a world cup triumph and the outcome of two wars as signs of British superiority.

Scientists say that around half of Britons have German blood coursing through their veins.

Anybody who paid attention in their history lessons knows that tribes from northern Europe invaded Britain after the Romans left in around 410AD.

England prepare to take on Germany at the 1966 World Cup. Archaeological evidence now suggests that 50 per cent of Britons have German blood flowing through their veins

But research by leading geneticists 
reveals the extent to which the Germans became part of the nation's 
racial mix.

Together with archaeologists who have spent years on sites 
in the UK, they conclude that 50 per cent of us have some German blood.

Biologists at University College in 
London studied a segment of the Y chromosome that appears in almost all 
Danish and northern German men – and found it surprisingly common in 
Great Britain.

Analysis of tooth enamel and bones found in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries supported these results.

Hengist and Horsa were two Germanic brothers who arrived on the south-east corner of England in 449 AD.

They are credited with leading the Angle, Saxon and Jutish armies that first conquered the Celts.

The siblings were called to Britain by the Celtic King Vortigem to defend his people against enemies including the Picts.

For their services, they were given the island of Thanet to live on.

However, following a series of falling-outs with the locals, they gradually came to own more and more land that eventually became known as the Kingdom of Kent.

Indeed, Hengist is traditionally named as the founder of the Kingdom of Kent.

German archeologist Heinrich Haerke 
believes 'up to 200,000 emigrants' crossed the North Sea, pillaging and 
raping and eventually settling.

The native Celts, softened by years of peace under the Romans, were no match for the raiding parties from across the North Sea.

Pottery and jewellery similar to that
 found in grave sites along the Elbe River in northern Germany has been 
unearthed in Anglo-Saxon cemeteries here.

There is also evidence the 
settlers remained in contact with relatives on the Continent for up to 
three generations.

The findings have caused a certain amount of gloating in Germany.

'There is no use in denying it,' 
wrote news magazine Der Spiegel. 'It is clear that the nation which most
 dislikes the Germans were once Krauts themselves. A number of studies 
reinforce the intimacy of the German-English relationship.'

Anglo-Saxon is a catch-all phrase to 
refer to the invaders of the fifth and sixth centuries AD.

Angles came 
from the southern part of the Danish peninsula and gave their name to 
England and the Saxons came from the north German plain.

There were 
other tribes – such as the Jutes, from Jutland, who settled in Kent.

The Anglo-Saxons drove the Britons 
into Cornwall, Wales and the North, but a few centuries later faced 
waves of invaders themselves – Vikings from Scandinavia and then the 
Normans in 1066.
