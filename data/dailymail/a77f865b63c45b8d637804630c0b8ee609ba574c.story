Crystal Palace have made a £2.5million offer for Lille left-back Pape Souare.

Manager Neil Warnock has made the move as the 23-year-old Senegal international falls into Palace's budget, although Lille want £3m.

Palace have asked about Neil Taylor at Swansea, Morocco left-back Achraf Lazaar of Palermo and discussed an ambitious move for Roma's Ashley Cole but have settled on Souare as he will snub joining up with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations.

Souare, who was also a member of Senegal's London Olympics squad, is eager to make the move and hopes Palace can reach a quick agreement with Lille who need the cash.

The Eagles have struggled of late, winning just one of their last 11 matches and, along with a striker, Warnock has outlined the need for a left-back in the January window. 

Joel Ward has been Warnock's first-choice there this season, but the 25-year-old is a natural right-back and would be moved to his correct position if a left-back was signed. 

Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock has been honest about Palace's transfer dealings, admitting that bids have already been put in for players - with a left-back high on the Eagles' radar
