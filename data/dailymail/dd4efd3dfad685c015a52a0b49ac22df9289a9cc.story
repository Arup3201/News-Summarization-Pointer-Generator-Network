'Attack': Malcolm Blackman, 45, allegedly twice raped a woman inside the Occupy London protest camp

An anarchist leader twice raped a woman at the infamous protest camp on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.

The alleged assaults happened at the squalid tent city set up by hundreds of anti-capitalists in the Occupy London group.

Malcolm Blackman, self-styled leader of computer hacking group Anonymous UK, raped the woman in her tent twice in seven days, including once when she had passed out drunk, the court heard.

The woman sobbed as she told the jury why she had not informed other Occupy members about the alleged rapes. ‘It was all, protest, protest, protest, and if you had any personal issues you were out of line,’ she said. She was scared to report the rapes for fear of upsetting the ‘togetherness’ of the group, which reportedly encouraged members to ‘focus on the protests’.

The woman also claims she was raped a third time and her hands violently bound with plastic ties – although Blackman, 45, has not been charged with this alleged offence.

Blackman apparently acted as a ‘leader’ and spokesman for Anonymous UK, the British wing of the global internet hacking group that carries out cyber attacks on capitalist targets and governments.

The court heard that he started a sexual relationship with the woman shortly after they met at the makeshift encampment in November 2011. He moved into her four-man tent in the new year after claiming the zip on his tent was broken.

The woman said: ‘He was a welcoming sort of character, people turned to him. He seemed to be a leader sort of person.’

But on January 14, while they were kissing in her tent, he apparently pulled plastic ties from his pocket and roughly tightened them around her wrists, before raping her.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said: ‘One minute it all seemed to be normal and the next minute he’s putting ties round my wrists and it’s really hurting. He held my hands in one hand and he put the ties round really quickly.’

Afterwards he cut the ties and she lay
sobbing while he fell asleep, she claimed.

Asked why she did not tell 
anyone, she replied: ‘I was ashamed and embarrassed. I didn’t know if it
was me perhaps not being experienced in a relationship. I saw it as 
something I had done wrong in some way.’

When asked why she had not evicted him
from her tent after that, she said: ‘I could have but I didn’t.

'He was a
very strong character and I was probably frightened of upsetting the 
general togetherness of the camp. I wanted to keep quiet, to keep in the
background and not make a big issue of it.’

'It was all, protest, protest, protest, and if you had any personal issues you were out of line'

The woman would spend every weekend at St Paul’s, returning to her job and home in London in the week.

The following Saturday, January 21, she returned to the camp and drank brandy and wine with other protesters.

Later that night, Blackman went into her tent and they had a conversation before she apparently ‘passed out’.

She said the next thing she remembered
was him assaulting her, but she was too ‘shocked’ to protest and he 
later fell asleep in the tent.

‘I was scared of him,’ she said. ‘I was 
confused about what to do. I was confused about the relationship.’

Activists spent much of their time at the St Paul’s camp drinking instead of protesting, the Old Bailey heard.

During the Occupy protest, between October 2011 and February 2012, some of those involved spent the days inside each other’s tents downing bottles of whisky, brandy and other spirits donated by supporters.

When they did attend protests, including those outside the US embassy and the Bank of England, they would return to the camp via ‘a few drinks’ in the pub.

Giving evidence against Malcolm Blackman, the alleged victim said: ‘There was a lot of drinking going on. Malcolm would drink most of the day. Other people would drink during the day.’

She recalled spending one day drinking wine and brandy, another sharing a bottle of whisky.

Blackman was linked to another protester around the time he was seeing the alleged rape victim, the court heard.

Jurors were played footage of the carnival atmosphere at the camp, with people performing juggling acts, waving flags and dancing on the cathedral steps.

In lieu of security, the camp had a ‘tranquillity tent’ where people were encouraged to go to discuss any problems.

The woman, who said her feelings for 
Blackman were ‘complicated’, returned to the camp on January 28, and 
went to a pub with other members.

In the evening she had a row with 
Blackman. She alleges they both later fell asleep in the same tent, 
along with a third man, something Blackman denies.

She told the court she awoke to find a
belt tied around her neck in a noose. Blackman allegedly forced her to 
perform a sex act on him.

‘He was quite forceful,’ she told the 
court. ‘He said, “You know you want it”.’ She said Blackman then told 
her she was ‘too touchy feely’, before climbing back into his sleeping 
bag.

The woman did not report the rape until June, by which time there was bitter in-fighting in Anonymous UK.

Gordon Ross, defending, claimed the woman had invented the allegations against Blackman because she wanted to ‘take him down’.

‘Effectively what you and others were trying to do was destroy him and his leadership of Anonymous UK,’ he said.

The woman admitted she was expelled 
from the Anonymous Facebook group by Blackman, along with others, after 
angry exchanges about the group. She also admitted confronting him over a
relationship he had started with another woman.

The Occupy London camp – in which 
Anonymous UK members camped closest to the cathedral – remained at the 
site for more than four months before being broken up by police in 
February last year.

Blackman, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, denies two counts of rape. The trial continues.
