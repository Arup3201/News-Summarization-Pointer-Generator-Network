The parents of a six-year-old girl who 
was gunned down in the Newtown massacre have described the emotional moment they met with the father of her killer, revealing they 'just talked as parents'.

Robbie and Alissa Parker met with Peter Lanza for more than an hour on January 23, just over a month after his son Adam shot dead their daughter Emilie and 25 others at her school.

They encouraged the meeting as part of their grieving process and 
because they felt Peter Lanza held some of the answers to their questions, they revealed on CBS This Morning.

'He had the most information about [Adam's] medical history, things that he had gone through,' Alissa Parker said in an interview that aired on Friday.

'I wanted to tell him that there was a 
lot of hope and opportunity to gain from this, that he held the keys to. There was information and things to be learned... and without 
his co-operation it would go no where.'

The Parkers said the meeting was encouraged by Mr Lanza.

A day after the killings, Robbie Parker spoke to the media and expressed his condolences for Peter Lanza, his son Ryan and their relatives, and Lanza had appreciated these words, Robbie said.

'We felt like an olive branch had been extended for us to get together and speak and just talk as parents,' Robbie Parker told CBS.

Sorrow: The Parkers told CBS Mr Lanza seemed grateful to have someone to talk to

Mr Parker, who revealed that his 
other two young daughters still cry over missing Emilie, said that the 
meeting was 'very emotional as you can imagine'.

'We
definitely expressed our condolences for one another and we felt he was
very receptive,' Mr Parker said. 'I got the impression he was very 
grateful for the chance to speak to somebody.'

While
the Parkers did not share any insights Mr Lanza gave them into his 
son's medical history or problems at home, they said they believe more 
information is yet to emerge.

They
added that, while they are not angry at Mr Lanza, they do hold him 
partly accountable for the horror their son inflicted on December 14 at 
Sandy Hook Elementary School.

'We don't hold him solely responsible,' Mrs Parker said. 'I
feel like he's made mistakes. I don't feel he should be responsible for 
what happened that day. It was not ultimately his decision to do [it].'

Angelic: The Parkers said they do not pay attention to news about Lanza as it does not bring Emilie back

Mrs
Parker also said that she believes Adam's mother Nancy - whom he shot 
in the face before going on his rampage at the school and ultimately 
taking his own life - was also partly responsible.

'Looking
from the outside in it's hard to think there can't have been things she
didn't see,' Mrs Parker said. 'I'm never going to understand that.

'Do I think it was her fault?I 'm sure there are things shes going to have to be accountable for.'

But
they also agreed they spent little time placing blame, as the outcome 
would be the same regardless of who they pointed fingers at.

Instead,
Mr Parker said they wanted to spend their energy being better parents 
to their other two daughters, Madeline and Samantha, who still have 'ups
and downs' about Emilie's absence.

Questions: They said their daughters, Samantha and Madeline, still get upset about their big sister

Loss: They said they do not blame Peter Lanza for their daughter's death but believe he is accountable

Talented: The Parkers remember their daughter as artistic and share many of her pictures on their blog

'[Madeline]
starts talking about something that she wished Emilie could have done 
with her and she starts crying,' Mr Parker said. 'It's okay to cry.'

She added that, when it comes to forgiving Adam, she has decided it is not her burden to bear.

'I do hold him accountable but I feel like God 
will determine that,' she said.'He's in a place where the judgment will happen. I don't have to judge him.'

Robbie
Parker, who was the first parent to speak out about his murdered child 
following the tragedy, said that their family has gone through 'a little
bit of everything' since losing Emilie.

'You went from the absolute 
worst experience that you could ever imagine to have to go through as a 
parent... to being completely overwhelmed 
with outpouring of love and support from so many people,' he told CBS.

Struggle: Mrs Parker said she also believes Nancy Lanza, pictured right, is accountable for her son's actions. Nancy Lanza became Adam's first victim when he shot her in the face before driving to the school

Remembered: Emilie's picture appears at a memorial for the children following the massacre

Last
week, it emerged that Adam Lanza kept a 7-ft-long spreadsheet detailing
previous gun massacres, including their death tolls and the weapons 
they've used.

But the 
Parkers, who have continued to meet with detectives since the deaths, 
said they just take this new information as it comes before moving on.

'It always brings with it a period of sorrow, pain, and you deal with it and you just move on,' Alissa said. 'The 
outcome is still the same, regardless if it was planned, not planned... It doesn't change that our child's 
gone.'

Speaking live on CNN a day after the massacre, Robbie Parker said that he was praying for the shooter's family and held no anger towards them. He also paid tribute to his slain daughter.

'My daughter Emilie would be one of 
the first ones giving her love and support to all of the victims, 
because thatâ€™s the kind of person she is,' he said, pausing a moment to 
take a steadying breath.

Grief: Robbie spoke to the press a day after Emilie's death and expressed his condolences for Peter Lanza

'As the deep pain begins to settle in
our hearts, we find comfort in the incredible person Emilie was and how
many people she was able to touch in her short time on Earth.

'Emilie's
laughter was infectious, and everyone who met her would agree that the 
world was a better place because she was in it.'

For his part, Peter Lanza has kept a 
low profile since the day of the shooting, when a reporter told him that
his son was responsible for the murders.

Neighbours of Peter Lanza and Shelley
Cudiner said the pair packed up their car and left their affluent home 
in the Stamford suburb of Westover, Connecticut, shortly after being 
informed.

The news reporter who told Lanza that his son had committed one of the worst mass shootings in American history described the moment in the Stamford Advocate.

'His expression twisted from patient, to surprise to horror,' wrote Maggie Gordon. 'It was obvious that this moment was the first time he had considered his family could be involved.'

Peter
Lanza is a vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services and
divorced Nancy Lanza in 2009 due to 'irreconcilable differences.'

Remembered: A memorial in Newtown after the shootings shows the names of Lanza's victims

More than a week after the massacre, Peter Lanza collected his son's body and released a statement saying the family was also asking why his son would go on a shooting spree.

'We too are asking why,' he said in a statement. 'Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.'

Twenty children and six adults were killed when Lanza opened fire on the once-peaceful town of Newtown, Connecticut, sending ripples of shock to through the nation and rekindling the gun debate.

The grade school shooting was one of the worst in history, second only to the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, where 32 people were shot dead.
