A Danish driver has died after crashing today at the Le Mans 24 Hours motor race in France.

Allan Simonsen was immediately treated by doctors and the race's medical team when he lost control of his Aston Martin and smashed into the safety barriers just 10 minutes into the race.

The 34-year-old, who was racing in his seventh race, was taken to the Circuit Medical Centre 'in a serious condition' but died from his injuries.

It is the first driver death at the iconic race since 1997.

'The Automobile Club de l'Ouest will make no further statement while the

Some of the biggest names in motorsport paid tribute to the driver today.

Formula 1 driver Jenson Button wrote

Safety is something we need 2 improve on in Motorsport.'

Felipe Massa wrote: 'Such a tragic 
news on the passing of Allan Simonsen. Sad day in motorsport. Thoughts 
and prayers are with his family.'

Simonsen's teammate, Scottish driver Jamie Campbell-Walter said his family want the team to carry on in the race.

Simonsen crashed heavily while racing at the Tertre Rouge bend, the highest point of the world famous race.

He hit the wall at high-speed before spinning away.

His family were immediately told of the crash by David Richards, the principal of the Aston Martin Racing team.

Simonsen was an experienced Le Mans campaigner and was racing for the seventh time at La Sarthe.

Only two days earlier Simonsen, along
with Danish team-mates Christoffer Nygaard and Kristian Poulsen, was 
celebrating after the number 95 Aston claimed pole position in the GTE 
Am class.

Simonsen was the Danish Formula Ford 
champion in 1999 and went on to race in Formula Palmer Audi and the 
British Formula Renault Championship before carving out a career in 
sports cars.

The 24 Hours of Le Mans race is the oldest endurance motor race in the world.

It has been held annually since 1923 and teams must continue to compete for 24 hours, swapping drivers about every two hours.

In 1997, French driver Sébastien Enjolras died during a Le Mans pre-qualifying session when his car burst into flames in a crash over the safety barriers.
