A retired diver has opened his very own Davy Jones-style locker of hundreds of nautical treasures he has salvaged from the seabed.

Ray Ives, 77, has spent 40 years amassing a huge trove of historical artifacts that he has found during thousands of deep sea dives off the British coast.

His collection includes canon balls, muskets, swords and even the bell from an ocean liner sunk by a German U-boat in the First World War.

Eclectic collection: For years Ray had stuffed his collection into a tiny shed in the back garden of his home in Plymouth, Devon

The former commercial diver has also collected a wealth of historic diving equipment such as copper helmets and underwater suits.

For years Mr Ives had stuffed his collection into a tiny shed in the back garden of his home in Plymouth, Devon.

But now the fascinating archive has gone on display to the public in a ramshackle museum made from shipping containers.

The directors of Yacht Haven Quay in Plymouth set up the makeshift museum for Mr Ives to house his spoils plundered from the seas off Devon and Cornwall.

The ecclectic collection has been dubbed â€˜Ray's Plaice' and is billed as a 'museum of dive treasures'.

The museum also boasts 19th Century bottles, propellers, coins, portholes, ammunition boxes, tools, bayonets and glass bottles.

Mr Ives started diving while serving with the Royal Marines then began doing it commerically in 1965.

Treasure trove: Ray Ives retrieved a lump of the infamous Torrey Canyon

He retired in the 1990s after a long career under the waves which included 16 years as a deep-sea diver on rigs in the North Sea.

Mr Ives, from Plymouth, said: 'My collection goes back to about 1970 when I would go diving and keep my eye out for things on the sea bed that looked interesting.

'I've found all kinds of bric-a-brac from guns and swords to coins, ammunition and even a bottle dating back to 1890.

Makeshift: Ray's museum is now homed in two shipping containers in Plymouth

'I've got about 20 cannonballs and a canon that came off a Dutch ship that sank in 1746. I have a rapier sword found in a river in Bideford that dates back to the 17th century and is inscribed in Latin.

'There's probably a couple of hundred artifacts in the museum now. In the old days when people lost things over the side they didn't bother looking for them and so they've been lost until now.

'Once I find these things I take it to an archeologist and he explains to me the history behind them.

'I used to keep all my stuff in a shed but then one of the directors came up to have a look and said they would like me to move into a couple of containers near the cafe.

'It's very popular now - it's brilliant. I don't keep any particular hours and there's no admission fees. Any money I get given all goes in a pot that's given to the services or Children in Need.

'I'll keep adding to the museum if I find anything but I haven't been diving for three weeks now because of the weather!'
