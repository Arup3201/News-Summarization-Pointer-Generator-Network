Auctioneers have been condemned by Jewish leaders after selling off a haul of Nazi memorabilia in Adelaide this week.

On Thursday, about 20 items from World War I and II went under the hammer and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $300 and $700 for a slice of Third Reich history.

Amongst the 560-item auction were Nazi flags, SS runes and a gas mask case.

About 20 Nazi items from World War I and II were sold on Thursday, including swastika-emblazoned flags

The auction came just days before Sunday's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of D-Day that contributed to Allied forces winning World War II.

But Jewish Community Council of South Australia president Norman Schueler said auction house Mason Gray Strange should have known better than to remind survivors of the Holocaust and their families of the horrific time.

'There are various ways of looking at this. The obvious thing - but not in this case - is that people are hoarding and keeping manifestations of an evil part of world’s history,' he said.

'They cling to it and see (Nazism) as unfinished work. 

'In this particular case it was literally an estate and it’s sad that someone did hoard it and everyone should realise the distress it causes.

'It’s particularly irresponsible of the auctioneer to profit by it, especially when the world’s biggest auction house, eBay, does not permit this stuff to be auctioned. That’s the crux of it.'

It has been 70 years since World War II, but Mr Schueler said it did not lessen the effects the Nazi regime had on survivors.

'They would not realise what it meant for someone to see a SS or swastika, they cannot know what it means to the family,' he said.

The Jewish community says the auction would have caused distress to survivors of the Holocaust

'It is not only felt by Jews but a lot of Germans suffered unnecessarily because of Hitler - there were many good Germans.

'Another thing that helps demonstrate the magnitude of what happened is that not only six million Jews were lost, but there 56 million people lost because of the war that Hitler started.'

Despite the controversy, Mason Gray Strange auctioneer Robert Hunkin said they had received no direct complaints from the community.

SS swords and daggers sold for between $500-$700 each, and flags were sold for between $300-$500

He said it was never the auction house's intention to offend anyone.

'I do understand the history (of the Holocaust) and am aware of it, but there was absolutely no feedback to express discuss or furore at the sale,' Mr Hunkin said.

'I am very sympathetic to the Jewish community and Mason Gray Strange had no intention of offending anyone and we regret if we have.'

Mason Gray Strange said they never meant to cause offence and were deeply sympathetic to the Jews

Mr Hunkin said he had decided to go ahead with the auction because there was a demand for military memorabilia in the past.

'They were German memorabilia but in previous auctions we have had militaria from all different nationalities and they always sell very well,' he said.

'We weren’t selling it to any neo-Nazis or radicals or anything like that, they were all militaria enthusiasts.'

SS swords and daggers were sold off for between $500 and $700 each and the Nazi flags went for between $300 and $500 each.
