Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. This week, Chico is given both barrels, why Jose Mourinho may not want to complain about West Ham and which teams Martin's tipping for the drop.

Chico, Chico, Chico.

Cheeky, cheating, Chico.

Andy Carroll didn’t catch you in the face. But you squealed like a tasered pig, then rolled and rolled and rolled and rolled. It was ridiculous.

Straight over: Andy Carroll saw red for this aerial 'challenge' on Swansea defender Chico

Can't believe it: Target man Carroll was dismissed by Howard Webb, putting the Hammers down to ten

Agony? Chico's rolling around and clutching his face may have contributed to Webb's decision

One minute you’re threatening your own team-mate with a brick and the next you’ve been shot by a sniper. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Chico’s reaction to Carroll’s arm going across the side of his head was pure theatre.

He should have been booked and I would hope his manager Michael Laudrup and team-mates will have words with him.

That is not what football is about.

Jose Mourinho’s outrageous rant about West Ham playing 19th Century football in their goalless draw against Chelsea was used to deflect from his own team’s inability to break down West Ham’s resolute, determined and dogged defending.

West ham doubled up in all areas and sat deep, not allowing any space behind their back four.

It meant the intricate play of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard was ineffective.

Resolute: Chelsea stars like Eden Hazard couldn't find a way past Hammers stars like Guy Demel (left)

Mourinho’s very clever, with a big smile on his face, at shifting all the blame on to Big Sam.

But underneath I think he was probably raging, knowing that without a top quality centre-forward they will not be able to win the Premier League.

And also that Juan Mata, with his superior passing ability in the final third, would no doubt have been more than useful on the night.

The Special Juan? Former Chelsea star Mata may have made a difference in the final third

His ability to slip a pass through the eye of a needle in the West Ham game would have been perfect for such deep defending.

I’m looking forward to Monday night when Jose takes his Chelsea team to Manchester City and we’ll see if they will play an open attacking, expansive game to take on Mr Pellegrini’s side.

It’s more likely Mourinho will be parking the super-yacht, as it is in Chelsea’s case, to keep out magic City’s relentless attack.

Not even the farcical situation at Leeds where my old chauffer Brian McDermott got sacked one minute then reinstated the next.

What a ridiculous situation.

Earlier in the week he was told that Gianluca Festa was coming in and wanted to sit on the bench for the game against Ipswich.

In the face of chaos: Brian McDermott was sacked one minute and reinstated the next at Leeds

Obviously Brian said no. Everyone knew what was happening and the prospective owner, Massimo Cellino, was quite obviously trying to force him out.

I know Brian very well and you couldn’t meet a nicer, humbler, more down-to-earth man if you tried.

While he was chief scout at Reading he kindly offered to be my chauffer for three months when I broke my leg playing in the Middlesex Cup final on a Sunday afternoon. I was assistant manager to Alan Pardew at the club then.

Brian picked me up every day and dropped me off after work and we had some great laughs.

Writing on the wall: Leeds fans showed their support for McDermott against Huddersfield

He used to have to help me with my crutches getting in and out of the car. Some of the highlights included late night journeys home after scouting and watching other teams play.

We would sit and listen to the late night peoples’ problems programme on the radio, about all sorts of tricky challenges we face in our lives.

When they sacked Brian on Friday, I wonder if he made one of those phone calls to his local radio station to ask for advice and guidance, as the inside of his head must’ve been all over the place.

With 14 games to go it is still possible for teams to put a run together to get out of relegation trouble.

It was obvious that Gus Poyet would improve the spirit of the playing staff at Sunderland after taking over from Paolo Di Canio.

Now bad boy Phil Bardsley and the magician on the wing Adam Johnson look like rejuvenated, regenerated and quality Premier League players.

Gus has also recruited well and he has proven what can be done.

Crystal Palace have also got momentum and now West Ham’s players have returned to fitness they will go from strength to strength.

Dead man walking? Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen trudges off the pitch after losing 3-0 to Southampton

Norwich lack a goal-scorer and with the players they’ve got I think they’ve done particularly well.

But it’s going to be tough for Fulham, West Brom and Cardiff City.

Strikers are the key in a relegation scrap.

It’s no surprise Rene Meulentseen got rid of Adel Taarabt and Dimitar Berbatov as their team ethic and willingness to do a shift are not the right ingredients for a recipe to avoid relegation.

Hush now: Cardiff will find it hard despite Craig Bellamy's winner against Norwich

Whether new record signing Kostas Mitroglou can score the goals to keep them up remains to be seen and the same applies to Kenwyne Jones at Cardiff City.

For me, relegation will go down to the last day and right to the wire, but it’s Fulham, West Brom and Cardiff City to go.

I’m out and about now watching loads 
of games and I empathise with the wicked, at times cruel, life of the 
professional football manager.

The
 frustration of the ball hitting the post and rolling along the line 
back into the goalkeeper’s arm; the blatant penalty decision not given; a
 simple pass to slot your centre forward in for a last-minute equaliser 
just over hit.

A supporter 
sat five yards from me at a game I went to last week was shouting his 
mouth off; I’m not sure if he was doing an impression of Sir Alf Ramsey,
 Sir Bobby Robson or Sir Alex Ferguson telling the manager exactly what 
he should be doing.

As the 
minutes ticked by on that luminous orange clock you know as a manager it
 is a ticking time bomb and brings you closer to the guillotine with 
every second that flashes by.

It’s draining, exhausting and you know there’s not a lot you can do.

It’s
 a horrible feeling and I’ve been there many, many times. But the desire
 to get back in and win another championship fuels the blood that flows 
through my veins.

As I wrote this column I was on my way
 to the Apple Store in Reading for a two-hour one-to-one tutorial to 
help improve my Apple Mac skills.

On
 the way I sat in the car park looking over the pitch where I played my 
first game of football for Southcote United FC, when I was aged seven, 
in an under 11 game.

I can remember it like it was yesterday.

To
 think that skinny, nice, quiet, young boy – with ambitions and dreams –
 could step from where I was standing to play at Anfield, Highbury, Old 
Trafford and Wembley, is quite surreal.

Oh my God, to think that was 41 years ago is quite scary.
