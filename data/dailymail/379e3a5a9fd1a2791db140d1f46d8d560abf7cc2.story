The trial of accused 9/11 terrorists held in Guantanamo Bay won’t officially begin for a year, but lawyers on both sides are already complaining about unprecedented challenges in what is the largest war crimes tribunal since the Second World War.

Defense lawyers for men accused of helping kill thousands of Americans on September 11 call the trial an unjust charade and claim the CIA has illegally monitored meetings between them and their clients, even going so far as to use a fake smoke detector without even the prosecution’s knowledge.

Chief prosecutor Army Brigadier General Mark Martins said he was swamped by untrue accusations that his evidence did not count because much of it was obtained during advanced interrogation like waterboarding.

Justice? Lawyers for three of the 9/11 defendants say the trial has become a charade before it has even begun

‘This is not a system that is set up to deliver justice,’ David Nevin, the attorney for the admitted mastermind of 9/11 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, told 60 Minutes for their segment about the upcoming trial, which aired Sunday.

Mr Nevin claims his client was waterboarded 183 times in a single month. While Mr Nevin filed a declaration that showed how his client had been treated, and under what conditions he confessed, the declaration had been censored because the military said its contents were classified.

Nevin also described a moment in the courtroom in January when a big red hockey light went off as he spoke.

The not-so-subtle light is to be lit by the judge or the court's security officer - and only when classified information is disclosed.

Journey: It's the first American war crimes trial since WWII and it will be held in over a year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Every six weeks, 250 lawyers and other court personnel are flown to Cuba at a cost of $90,000

Chief prosecutor Brigadier General Mark Martins insists the law is being followed and denies the assertion that a legal admission of guilt can't follow harsh coercion techniques like waterboarding after a certain amount of time has elapsed

But neither the judge nor the security officer turned the light on. And Mr Nevin claims he hadn’t disclosed anything classified.

When the judge investigated, it was determined that the CIA had hit the light - and it isn’t the only time the agency had made its presence in the military proceeding.

Attorney Cheryl Bormann, who represents Walid bin Attash, believes she once caught the CIA red handed.

She said: ‘I'm meeting with my client in a room. And, up on the ceiling, like you would normally find in a jail with a client, there's a smoke detector.

Silenced: Cheryl Bormann represents Walid bin Attash. She says she caught the CIA illegally monitoring her meetings with her client using a fake smoke detector, and that she's not legally allowed to even discuss whether he was waterboarded

Does he deserve it? David Nevin represents Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the admitted mastermind of 9/11. He says his client was waterboarded 183 times in a month but he's being censored from presenting it in his defense

Alerted: Nevin said this light in the Gitmo courtroom, designed to alert the court when someone has divulged classified info, mysteriously went off - and it turned out to the the CIA listening in

‘And one day I'm sitting in there and my client stops one of the correctional guards and says, "That's - what is that? You're listening, aren't you?". The guard says, "Of course we're not listening. That's a smoke detector”.’

She said she believed the guard but decided to investigate anyway, and got a big surprise when she Googled the smoke detector's manufacturer.

She said: ‘It turns out that they only make listening devices that are intended to
look like smoke detectors and other surreptitious listening devices. We find this out while we're in Guantanamo.’

Mr Nevin
said the government refused to disclose why, how, or even if the CIA was
monitoring the 9/11 detainees, over 150 of whom had not been charged 
with a crime in their 12 years at Guantanamo.

Constitutional loophole? The defense complains that the constitution has been 'kicked down the road' in Guantanamo as over 150 detainees remain there, still without being charged, after 12 years

'We've got to ensure that what we do in these cases is justice and can't be accused of being vengeance,' said Martins. 'And that's a great challenge.'

Colonel Martins
said the proceedings were being handled in accordance with the law, and 
said he didn’t know who, for instance, turned on the red light.

As
for the years-long wait for trial, Mr Nevin said: ‘That's one of the reasons I have a 
sense of urgency to try everybody that we can try.'

While
Ms Bormann said she couldn't even discuss any classified torture her client 
might or might not have undergone (or else face up to 30 years in prison), 
Colonel Martins insisted the evidence he using was obtained from a so-called 
‘clean-team’ sent in after President Barack Obama banned advanced interrogation.

Besides, he said: ‘Justice requires that you look deeper.

‘The
people do not forfeit their chance for accountability because someone 
may have crossed a line or have coerced or subjected to harsh measures 
somebody who is in custody.'

He insisted the trial was being treated just like any other trial in the United States for a U.S. civilian citizen.

He said: ‘The
accused is presumed innocent, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. We've got to ensure that what we do in 
these cases is justice and can't be accused of being vengeance. And 
that's a great challenge.’

The defense, including Navy Commander Walter Ruiz - the attorney for Mustafa al-Hawsawi - disagrees.

He said: ‘Every
day we listen to the national anthem in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but yet the constitution has been kicked down the road and is 
persona non grata in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.’
