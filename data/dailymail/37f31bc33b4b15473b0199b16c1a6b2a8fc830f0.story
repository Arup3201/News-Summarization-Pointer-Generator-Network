The stage curtains maybe open, but this abandoned theatre has not  put on a single show for decades.

There is a huge hole in the ceiling and the seats, that years ago would have been full, are now eerily silent as the long ago abandoned venue, slowly decays.

These haunting pictures were captured by  urban explorer and photographer Nicola Bertellotti and tell the story of a once-loved buildings across Europe which have been left to succumb to the forces of nature.

Faded glory: This was once a bustling auditorium but now there is a huge hole in the ceiling and rubble covers the remains of the wooden seats

His adventures have seen him explore once opulent villas, churches, and homes, which have been left abandoned for decades, and are finally bowing to the ravages of time.

Mr Bertellotti has slipped into hundreds of buildings across Europe to snap pictures of the crumbling ruins before they are reclaimed by nature or vandalised beyond recognition.

He says his research is directed towards the aesthetics of decay and is brought to light through his photographic lens.

Mr Bertellotti's work is permanently on display in the  Arte a Colori gallery in Colle di Val d'Elsa, Italy, or can be viewed at www.nicolabertellotti.com 

Eerily silent: This once grand former home appears a shadow of its former self with dust and dirt covering the floor and green moss growing on the walls

Hive of activity: The workers have long left and this once busy factory which is now slowly decay as water seeps in through the roof

Reclaimed by nature: Long since abandoned by humans Mother Nature has slowly started to reclaimed the space

Forbidden places: Hidden away from the view of human eyes photographer Nicola Bertellotti captured this stunning image

This may not be on the usual tourist trail, but the urban explore discovered this crumbling staircase inside one of Europe's rotting homes

Faded glamour: The murals may have lasted the test of time, but the structure is slowly crumbling around them, in this villa in Italy

Beauty in abandonment: Where others see ruins that should be pulled down, photographer Nicola Bertellotti finds a ghostly beauty 

Hidden gems: The extravagant furniture left behind gives a hint of what life was like within these walls before they were left to crumble

Stunning: The Chambre du Commerce in Belgium is a huge draw for urban explorers. The building, in Antwep, was erected in 1872 as a reconstruction of a 1531 Stock Exchange. It ceased being used in 2003 after failing to meet fire safety regulations and lay abandoned for seven years until a series of renovation plans were put forward. A private investor wants to turn the building into shops, a grand cafe, restaurants and a luxirous hotel.

Industrial beauty: Despite the years and natures efforts to reclaim it, this industrial building appears to have remained strong

Not so grand piano: The music room in a decaying building still has an air of faded glamour that gives a hint to its past

All that remains: This was once a popular bowling alley has been left in disrepair after the last customers left

Glimpse into the past: These beautifully painted blue ceiling are still visible in an abandoned Polish castle 

Untouched by humans: A wooden shed stands alone in the centre of this massive cylinder that has been left empty for years

Holy site: The altar and a number of pews remain in this crumbling church that has not held a service for decades

Frozen in time: The wine glasses, vases and jugs, remain but plants are threatening to take over this house

Abandoned: A rusting single chair is all that is left to show that humans once occupied this space

Photographer Nicola Bertellotti has uncovered breathtaking and bizarre sites on his travels across Europe as he explores empty buildings 

Left in a hurry: Books and papers left behind by the previous owners can still be seen scattered across the floor. A gnome has also been left on the fireplace

Urban decay: Window frames, broken glass, crumbling bricks, and rubble, cover the floor of this abandoned building

Italian Photographer Nicola Bertellotti enjoys capturing symbols 'of a lost time that you aspire to find,' he says on his website

In his series of images he brings forgotten places back to life through the lens of his trusted camera

Life through a lens: A rotting mansion that was once home to a wealthy family but is now covered in dust and decay

Road to nowhere: These cars covered with rust, leaves and moss have not driven their owners anywhere in a very long time

Golden aged: Only the very brave would dare to scale this crumbling spiral staircase that now leads to nowhere

Creepy site: The mattresses and the pillows remain but you would not get a good night sleep inside what appears to be an abandoned hospital

Falling to pieces: This building has been left a skeleton of its former glory and is now slowly crumbling 

Palatial past: The wall paintings and intricate floor tiles give a hint that this was once a grand home for someone 

Empty: With its balconies, arches and domed ceilings this church in Poland has not seen human life for many years

Grand staircase: Urban explorers are the only ones brave enough to scale these stairs now after years of being left to rot 

Remains of life: A single bath tub is all the remains in this house that was once a treasured family home

Cooling off period: This central energy cooling tower in Belgium stopped working many years ago, but remains standing
