Steven Gerrard has admitted he may one day regret not ‘challenging’ himself by accepting an offer to join Real Madrid.

But as he prepares to lead Liverpool into a blockbuster clash against the European champions, Gerrard insists he would have regretted it even more had he turned his back on his boyhood club.

The 34-year-old was courted by Madrid in 2010 at the start of the summer that saw Jose Mourinho appointed Real manager but Gerrard stayed loyal to Liverpool. 

Steven Gerrard says he had opportunities to join Real Madrid over his career

He said: ‘It is very flattering to be linked to a huge club like Real Madrid. I’ve had a couple of options throughout my career to go to Real Madrid but I resisted temptation, because of the big connection I have to my hometown club.

‘It may be something I regret down the line, for not challenging myself and having a change of scenery in a different country, but I would have had an even bigger regret if I’d left the club I love.

‘I’m a big fan of Real Madrid. They are a special club. But Liverpool is my No 1 club.’

This will be only the fourth meeting between Liverpool and Real, and the Reds have an unblemished record, with victories coming in the 1981 European Cup final and the Champions League last-16 tie in 2009 — a 5-0 demolition.

Gerrard scored twice when Liverpool beat Madrid 4-0 in the second leg at Anfield five years ago. That night is recalled with great fondness by Liverpool supporters and manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his players to make themselves legends by recording another victory. 

Gerrard and Rodgers spoke to the press ahead of Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid

Brendan Rodgers is preparing Liverpool for the test of Real Madrid on Wednesday 

‘These are the types of games that are talked about for years and years,’ said Rodgers. ‘Stevie’s two goals in the last game against them are still talked about. The performances are in the big games and if you make a big contribution that is what the supporters remember.

‘We are going into the game after being up and down but underpinning all the great performances last season was the spirit and character in the group and that will serve them well.

‘They can go into the game to get a result for the team. What can come from that is a legendary status.’ 

Madrid are odds-on favourites to win but former Liverpool defender Alvaro Arbeloa insisted there would be no complacency as ‘even if Liverpool had lost 10-0 at the weekend’ Carlo Ancelotti’s squad would still be worried.

‘We know what they can do in Europe,’ said Arbeloa.

Rodgers, whose side are on the back foot after losing to Basle in their last group match, wants games such as tonight’s to be the norm.

‘If we didn’t come out of the group we would be bitterly disappointed,’ said Rodgers. ‘But in order for us to be there we have to ensure that our league form keeps us in the top four. It’s a competition that I, as a coach and a manager, want us to be in for a long, long time.’
