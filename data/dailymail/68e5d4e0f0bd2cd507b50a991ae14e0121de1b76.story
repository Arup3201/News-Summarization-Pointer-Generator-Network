Three people including a young child were hurt when a fairground ride collapsed while they were on it at a bonfire night display. 

The event at Heaton Park in Stockport, Manchester, was winding down when the ride collapsed, injuring the man, woman and child at around 9pm.

Paramedics were called to the scene though the victims did not need hospital treatment. 

Three people were hurt when the ride collapsed at Heaton Park last night where revellers were enjoying a bonfire night party 

A steel staircase leading up to the ride collapsed, causing the three victims to hurt their legs, 

Earlier in the evening a man was arrested at the same event after flying a drone over crowds in the park during the Light Up The Night party. 

An estimated 32,000 people attended the event which is hailed as one of Manchester's largest bonfire night parties. 

The ride was one of many laid on by organisers alongside food stalls and live music. The party was organised by Manchester City Council and local churches and charities. 

It has since been shut down, and police are contacting the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the cause of the accident.
