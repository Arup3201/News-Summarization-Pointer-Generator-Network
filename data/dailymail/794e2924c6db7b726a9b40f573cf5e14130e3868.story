NASA has undertaken the task of mapping the pattern of volcanic heat on the surface of Jovian moon Io.

The heat pouring out of Io's hundreds of erupting volcanoes - the most volcanic place in the known solar system - indicates a previously unknown complex, multi-layer source, scientists found.

The data, collected by both NASA's Voyager and Galileo spacecraft and ground-based telescopes, left researchers surprised at it disposes of  the generally-accepted model of internal heating.

It was collated to build a map of hot spots, illustrating the amount of heat being emitted, that shows the global distribution and wide range of volcanic activity on Io. Most of Io's eruptions dwarf their contemporaries on Earth.

Researcher Ashley Davies, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, added: 'The fascinating thing about the 
distribution of the heat flow is that it is not in keeping with the 
current preferred model of tidal heating of Io at relatively shallow 
depths.

'Instead, the main thermal emission occurs about 
40 degrees eastward of its expected positions.'

His colleague Dennis Matson added: 'The
pattern that emerges points to a complex heating process within Io. What we see indicates a mixture of both deep and shallow 
heating.'

A mystery has also emerged - the team
found that active volcanoes accounted for only about 60 per cent of 
Io's heat, mostly emanating from flat-floored volcanic craters called 
paterae, a common feature on Io.

Scientists are still trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the 'missing' 40 per cent.

Lead researcher Glenn Veeder, of the Beat Fight Institute in Winthrop, Washington, said: 
'We are investigating the possibility that there are many smaller 
volcanoes that are hard, but not impossible, to detect. We are now 
puzzling over the observed pattern of heat flow.'

Understanding this will help 
scientists identify the tidal heating mechanisms not only within Io, but
also may apply to neighbouring Europa, a high-priority target for NASA 
in its search for life beyond Earth.

The
Galileo mission was launched by the space shuttle Atlantis in 1989 to 
Jupiter, produced numerous discoveries and provided scientists decades 
worth of data to analyse.

Galileo was the first spacecraft to 
directly measure Jupiter's atmosphere with a probe and conduct long-term
observations of the Jovian system.

NASA extended the mission three times 
to take advantage of the craft's unique science capabilities, and it was
put on a collision course into Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003 
to eliminate any chance of impacting Europa.
