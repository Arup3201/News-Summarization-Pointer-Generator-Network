The parents of two step-brothers have spoken of their heartache that both boys are suffering the same muscle-wasting condition.

Cameron McKenzie, eight, and Ben Stewart, nine, are unlikely to survive beyond their teenage years after being told they are both suffering Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

The condition has left Cameron largely confined to his wheelchair, while the same fate is expected to befall his step-brother Ben in the near future.

The brothers, who are also best friends, were both diagnosed as toddlers, but only met four years ago when their parents rekindled a romantic teenage relationship

Around one in 3,500 boys in the UK are born with DMD, but two unrelated brothers having the condition is simply a very unlucky chance association, London-based genetics specialist Dr Anand Saggar, told MailOnline.  

In the face of their bleak prognosis, the inspiring pair, from Stoneyburn, West Lothian in Scotland, have compiled a bucket list of dreams they aim to complete before their time runs out.

Meeting comedian Harry Hill, the cast of Top Gear, a dream holiday to Australia and spending Christmas with Mickey Mouse, all feature on the boys' list.

The pair's parents Sheryl and Alan Stewart, both 35, and their sisters Phoebe, six and Layla, two, are helping the boys achieve their dreams before their bodies begin to fail them. 

Mrs Stewart, who has now become a full-time carer for the brothers, said: 'What's important is fulfilling their dreams and having no regrets.

'If the worst happens sooner rather than later, we want to know we've done everything we could to make their dreams come true.

'The boys have got such a special bond, they would literally do anything for each other. It's good that they've both got each other.

'They're getting a wee bit older and Cameron is deteriorating earlier than we thought - we don't think he'll go another year walking - so now is the time.

'The only thing we are going to be left with when they are gone is memories and photos so it means everything to us.'

Ben and Cameron were both diagnosed as toddlers, but only met four years ago when their parents rekindled a romantic teenage relationship.

Mr and Mrs Stewart were childhood sweethearts almost 20 years ago, but the love affair waned - until they met years later.

Fate brought them back together and they discovered that both their children were suffering from the same illness.

They tied the knot in 2011, which made Cameron and Ben step-brothers and the best of friends.

Ben and Cameron have compiled a bucket list of adventures they want to complete before their bodies become too affected by their condition

Mrs Stewart, who has now become a full-time carer for the brothers, said: 'What's important is fulfilling their dreams and having no regrets. If the worst happens sooner rather than later, we want to know we've done everything we could to make their dreams come true'

Both boys have been on steroids to help keep them mobile for longer, but the side-effects were so severe the family felt there was no alternative but to stop. The drug withdrawal has accelerated their decline

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a neuromuscular condition caused by a lack of protein called dystrophin.

Around 100 boys with the serious condition, which causes progressive muscle weakness, are born in the UK each year.

It is a genetic condition and can be inherited.

The condition starts early in childhood and maybe detected when noticing a child has difficulty standing up.

Children with DMD will struggle to walk, climb and run.

The condition causes muscles throughout the body to weaken and waste, including those of the
heart and chest.

Around one in 3,500 boys in the UK are born with DMD.

Symptoms of the condition include:

Mrs Stewart said: 'It's so rare to even know someone who has a child with DMD, for it to happen to both of us, it's unbelievable.

'It's a one in a million chance that this would happen.'

The family have now managed to get financial support from the Fund a Wish Foundation, which will go towards an adventure trip to Lapland in early December.

But the pressure is on to get Ben and Cameron to meet their TV idols and their favourite animals in Australia, before their condition deteriorates.

Both boys had been on steroids, to help keep them mobile for longer, but the side-effects were so severe the family felt there was no alternative but to stop.

The drug withdrawal has accelerated the decline of Cameron's health and he is now showing signs of curvature of the spine - which could crush his lungs and heart.

'We really need to do the bucket list items before they need the respirators, the ventilators, before they need the feeding tubes and things like that,' said Mrs Stewart.

'We're desperate not to leave it too late because we want Cameron to be able to walk at least some parts of it.'

Mr Stewart, who works as a graphic designer, added: 'We are on a limited time scale of what the boys can do before their condition deteriorates.

'We have hard times ahead, so we made a conscious decision to make their dreams come true. It won't be easy, but it would mean the world to us.'
