Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough believes a Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur has given the League One club the perfect opportunity to finally leave their part in the Ched Evans saga behind them.

Clough has turned his club into the modern day giantkillers to be feared by all others over the last couple of years, with last year’s run to the semi-final of the FA Cup meaning that they have only lost once in their last 17 cup games.

As incredible as that is, United are unfortunately still tainted a little by their attempts to sign convicted rapist Evans on his release from prison last year. That move was eventually scrapped after pressure from outside and indeed their own sponsors and now Clough hopes they can move on.

‘That’s good and it is always nice when there are more positive headlines, with stories focused on what is happening on the pitch,’ said Clough.

‘Every football club wants to be talked about because of what it does on the pitch rather than off it and this gives us another opportunity to be discussed in a good light.’

Certainly Clough and his players deserve some positive PR. Last season’s FA Cup efforts saw them beat Aston Villa and Fulham before they lost to Hull City at Wembley. This season, meanwhile, they have knocked Queens Park Rangers out of that competition and overcame Southampton at home in the last round of this one.

Clough is modest enough to suggest some of his team’s success has its roots in good fortune. The statistics don’t lie, though, and undoubtedly the United manager’s policy of routinely fielding strong teams in cup ties has paid off.

On Wednesday night he merely hopes his team can get out of White Hart Lane without a hiding. If they are still in touch with Spurs before next week’s second leg in Yorkshire then logic and recent history suggests they will have a great chance.

Asked if Tottenham may be under some pressure on Wednesday night, Clough said: ‘Certainly in the home leg, yes. We have that same feeling week in and week out in League One.

‘At Bramall Lane, people expect us to roll teams over but for the opposition it is one of their biggest games of the season.

‘Hopefully, the roles will be reversed on Wednesday but without doubt they have the quality to hurt you, even if we play to our absolute maximum.

‘If Harry Kane is on song, Christian Eriksen and people like that, they have the quality to hurt any team in Europe.

‘But we don’t fear it. We are aware of how good they are but we don’t go into too much detail otherwise we would shaking before we even get on to the pitch.

‘I’m not sure Tottenham will be too worried, looking at them in the last few weeks. I don’t think they’ll be too concerned but I think they’ll be more aware of us.

‘If you get results in the cup competitions I think the opposition does become a little bit more aware, and cautious we hope, but with what they’ve got to put on the pitch they’ll back themselves.

‘We’ve got to try and stay in the tie for the second leg. That’s the main thing.’
