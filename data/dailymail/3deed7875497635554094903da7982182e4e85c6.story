A Chili's line cook – and aspiring rapper - from Florida has proven to be far too 'hot' for the fast-food chain specializing in spicy food.

The resident of Brandon, Florida, who goes by the name 'Justin J. Speekz,' was fired from his job at the Chili's restaurant on Lithia Pinecrest Road in Valrico after uploading suggestive photos of himself at work on Facebook.

One of the images, which caused such a stir, depicted Mr Speekz posing in a black apron and a backwards baseball cap, but without a shirt, in the kitchen of the Chilli’s eatery.

Too 'sexy' for his job: A Chili's cook from Florida who goes by the name Justin Speekz was fired after he posted shirtless photos of himself at work on Facebook 

Proud of his looks: The heavily tattooed and pierced cook titled the series of photos 'Sexy Cooks of Chili's' 

Fire-able offense: Mr 'Speekz' went so far as to tag his employer's page in his post

The heavily tattooed and pierced employee proudly labelled his topless snapshots 'Sexy Cooks of Chili's' and brazenly tagged the eatery in the post.

He also shared other images in the same vain, two of them reportedly showing Speekz reclining on a table where food is prepared. The pictures have since been removed.

A concerned Chili's customer spotted Speekz's boudoir snapshots last week and raised the alarm.

A spokesperson for Chili's Bar and Grill said in a statement to the station WFTS: ‘Chili's clearly does not encourage this type of behavior in our restaurants. We maintain very high standards of food quality, safety and cleanliness and took immediate steps to ensure the restaurant continues to follow these requirements.'

Booted out: The cook was swiftly terminated from the Chili's restaurant on Lithia Pinecrest Road in Valrico, Florida 

Fallback position: Justin is also an aspiring rapper who goes by the stage name J Speekz 

Player: In 2011, 'J Speekz' was featured in a music video by local rapper Krazy Eight called 'Getting Money Boi'

‘Additionally, we ended this team member's employment after learning of his conduct.’

The Department of Business and Professional Regulation investigated the incident and reported that no official violations have been found in Speekz’s pictures because no food was being prepared at the time of the impromptu photo shoot. 

Luckily for Mr 'Speekz,' he has his fledgling career in hip hop to fall back on.

In 2011, 'J Speekz' was featured in a music video by local rapper Krazy Eight called 'Getting Money Boi' - a DIY effort with a low production value boasting all the tropes of the genre, from $100 bills stashed under the mattress to guns, scantily clad women and even a raucous pool party.
