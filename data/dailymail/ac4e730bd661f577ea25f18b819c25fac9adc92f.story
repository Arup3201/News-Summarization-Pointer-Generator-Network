Sally Davies warned the number of women choosing to have children later in life is a 'worrying issue'

The country’s chief  medical officer has warned that the number of women who are choosing to have children later in life is a ‘worrying issue’.

Professor Dame Sally Davies said that trying to start a family in their late 30s and early 40s would reduce women’s chance of conception and could increase the medical risks.

She went on to say: ‘The steady shift to have children later, there are issues with that. We all assume we can have children later but actually we may not be able to.’

She also expressed concern that ‘many more women’ are choosing not to have children.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 20 per cent of women now reach the age of 45 without having children – twice the proportion than the previous generation, born in 1945.

Professor Dame Sally insisted that she was not suggesting women should have children  earlier, saying: ‘It’s not for me to tell women what to do.’

But she pointed out that it was a well-known fact that fertility declines as women get older.

Dame Sally, who earns more than £225,000 a year as the Government’s top medical adviser, also said that breastfeeding should be an accepted part of everyday office life – even in meetings.

Addressing an event organised by the Wellbeing of Women charity in London yesterday, Dame Sally, 64, said that one way of boosting women’s prospects in the workplace would be by encouraging them to breastfeed at work. She then talked candidly about the time that she shocked male colleagues when she attempted to breastfeed her daughter during a meeting.

Speaking of the need to make breastfeeding more ‘acceptable’, she said: ‘I was there in this giant shirt with a baby hiding under it and a comment was made and my response was quite sharp.’

Dame Sally – a consultant specialising in blood disorders – also said women doctors were currently ‘underestimated,’ poorly paid and far less likely to be in positions of power compared to men.

And she used her speech to try to encourage the NHS to do more to ensure that women can ‘make it up the ladder’.

Over the last decade the number of female doctors has increased by 50 per cent and by 2022 they are expected to outnumber men for the first time. But as many only work part-time to look after children,  concerns have been raised that it has led to staffing shortages and gaps on the rota.

Dame Sally said the country ought to learn how to accept breastfeeding in the workplace and make it a normal issue rather than a feminist one. File image

Only this week Chris Ham, chief executive of the King’s Fund think-tank, said an increase of women doctors was partly to blame for a current shortage of A&E medics.

But Dame Sally, who also has two grown-up daughters, said: ‘I’m getting very bored with being one of the only women in the room.

‘Women are underestimated across the medical profession.

‘Breastfeeding has increased in  the UK, steadily but it is not increasing enough.

‘But how do we make it more acceptable in the workplace.

‘How do we make it more accessible for women to breastfeed their child without making it a feminist issue and instead making it a normal issue.’ She went on to call for equal pay for male and female doctors, saying : ‘Women doctors are underestimated in senior positions.

‘You would still however expect women working in medicine to get the same salaries.’

In August Dame Sally revealed that she had experimented with  cannabis two or three times whilst at university but stopped after  suffering hallucinations.
