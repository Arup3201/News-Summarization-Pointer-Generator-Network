Lasers have long been big beauty news among the glitterati - Madonna, Katherine Jenkins, Kate Moss and Kim Kardashian are all fans.

But with prices in excess of £300 for a full face treatment in a clinic, they cost more than most of us can afford.

That could be about to change with the launch of a new £450 laser gun which claims to zap away ageing wrinkles.

Wrinkle buster: Lasers are routinely used to tackle skin conditions such as acne as well as unwanted hair

While it might sound like something 
you'd see in Star Trek, the laser gun is actually the latest technology 
in DIY beauty treatment.

The Tria Skin Rejuvenating Laser is the first device to offer clinical-strength laser technology in a device that can be used safely at home.

While its price tag of £450 may look steep, it costs the same as just one treatment at a professional clinic, where patients typically undergo 10 sessions of laser blasts to see visible anti-ageing improvements.

The hand-held device works by harnessing the same light-based fractional laser technology that is used in professional clinics to fight fine lines and wrinkles, as well as changes in skin texture and discolouration.

The laser creates light energy which stimulates production of new collagen, the ingredient that pumps up the skin and irons out wrinkles.

Although you won't have to go to a salon to use it, the company does say that it has to be used every day for at least eight weeks to see noticeable results.

In a clinical study by skin experts, three in four users experienced a significant improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, discolouration and redness.

Independent consultant dermatologist Dr Penelope Tymapanidis said: 'Tria's Skin Rejuvenating Laser allows you to treat yourself in the comfort of your home.

'A session in a clinic is more intense and last longer, therefore the recovery time may be longer.

'The effectiveness of Tria lies in the fact that you treat yourself for a few minutes daily, over an eight-week period, so you eventually reach the benefits of an in-clinic laser treatment by small steps.

'It is priced at approximately the same cost of one in-clinic treatment. I would recommend by clients to have at least 10 Tria treatments to see visible anti-ageing results.'

The Tria Skin Rejuvenating Laser is available at triabeauty.co.uk and at Selfridges.

Safe: Lasers might sound like something out of Star Trek but unlike Death Rays, they won't harm you
