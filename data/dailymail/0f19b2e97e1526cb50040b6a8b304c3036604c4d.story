Brendan Rodgers took time out from preparing for the Europa League this week to meet the Queen at the Diabetes UK reception for the charity's 80th birthday. 

The Liverpool boss was at the event with his daughter Mischa, 19, who suffers from type one diabetes.

Rodgers praised the 19-year-old and admitted it was a privilege to be involved in the charity.

He said: 'My role is to support, firstly Mischa. And she has been incredible as a young lady being diagnosed.

'And then to be able to support the charity is a great honour, and it is a complete honour and privilege to be here.'

The former Swansea boss also spoke about the seriousness of the disease and how important the work of the charity is.

‘An event like this shows the seriousness of diabetes - if someone like the Queen is patron of the charity and is celebrating the work at that it does.’ he added.

Rodgers' daughter, who was seven when she was diagnosed, admits it a big deal at that tender age but praised the work of Diabetes UK.

She said: 'I have now got cousins around me who are seven years old. It is only when you look at them that you realise they are babies.

'They are so young, and so to try and get your head around it, is quite a big thing. It makes you realise how young I was.'

Liverpool welcome an old foe to Anfield on Thursday when former Chelsea striker Demba Ba returns for the first time since Steven Gerrard's slip last season allowed him to score  and all but end the Reds' title hopes.

Besiktas are top of the Turkish Super Lig and are unbeaten in this year's Europa League campaign.

Rodgers' side will be without winger Lazar Markovic for the game after he was handed a four-game ban following his sending off against Basle in December. 

Markovic tweeted his shock at the length of the ban, posting '4?' when he discovered his fate.
