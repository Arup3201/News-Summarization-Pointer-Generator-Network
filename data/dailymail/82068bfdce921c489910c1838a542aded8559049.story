Drink-drive crash: Tracy Watts was four times over the legal alcohol limit when she crashed her sports car

A police officer is facing jail after she admitted crashing a sports car while four times over the drink-drive limit after binge drinking on a bottle of vodka.

Tracy Watts was arrested after crashing her MG TF into a bollard along Southend seafront, Essex, while heavily drunk.

Watts admitted she had drunk a bottle of vodka when questioned by cops at the scene of the early evening crash.

The 31-year-old appeared at Southend Magistrates’ Court today wearing a black suit, white blouse and sky blue jumper.

She hung her head as she appeared in the dock and pleaded guilty to a single charge of drink-driving.

Watts, who worked as a WPC for City of London Police, was warned she faces up to six months in jail when sentenced.

Lead magistrate Roger Harbidge said: 'This makes for very disturbing reading and it is only good fortune you did not injure anyone else.

'You must understand a custodial sentence is very likely in this case.'

Watts will now have to wait to discover her fate while a full probation report is prepared.

The court heard how Watts collided with a bollard along Eastern Esplanade, in Southend, at around 7.15pm on March 26 this year.

Police and an ambulance rushed to the scene where Watts admitted to officers from Essex Police that she had consumed a bottle of vodka before the crash.

No other people were injured and Watts was rushed to a local hospital and a blood sample was taken.

She recorded a blood-alcohol level of 320mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - four times over the UK drink-drive limit of 80mcg per 100ml.

Watts, from Shoeburyness, Essex, resigned from her role as a City of London police officer less than a fortnight after the crash.

Miss Bo-Eun Jung, mitigating, said her client had underlying drink problems and was working to deal with them.

She told the court: 'My client has underlying psychological and alcohol problems which are being looked at.'

Watts was given unconditional bail and received an interim banning order meaning she is disqualified from driving until the outcome of the case.

She is due to be sentenced at Southend Magistrates’ Court later this year.
