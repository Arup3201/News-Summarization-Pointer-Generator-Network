Mothers taking their children back to school this week have driven a rise in the demand for anti-ageing treatments.

The Harley Medical Group has seen an 18 per cent increase in the number of women wanting treatments such as Botox, Dermal Fillers and face peels - and they believe the pressure to look good at the school gates is to blame.

A spokesman for the Group, that has clinics across the UK, said more 'yummy mummies' have been booking treatments throughout June, July and August, compared to the previous three months.

The Group saw a rise in enquiries for 
laser treatment for pigmentation and brown spots, Dermal Fillers and 
Line and Wrinkle treatments.

'We aren't talking about making women look like movie stars or supermodels. We are talking about refreshing them post holidays, capitalising on their post holiday glows and getting them looking good for the autumn months ahead,' said Dr Naylor of The Harley Medical Group.

Other treatments which are popular amongst mothers who visit the Group's 21 clinics include Laser Rejuvenation or Obagi Blue Peel to treat pigmentation caused by pregnancy or sun damage, Dermaroller Therapy to give the skin a healthy glow and Botox and Dermal Filler treatments to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

'Having a "Mummy Makeover" is part of a trend toward women wanting to look refreshed again after the summer holiday break,' Dr Naylor added. 'We aren't creating beauty, we are simply restoring it.'

The news comes after it was revealed in MailOnline last week that mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates.

They will have spent a collective £658m on clothes, jewellery and beauty treatments.

One in five admitted in a survey that they feel under pressure to look glamorous on the school run.

Forums on parenting websites are awash with mothers lamenting their dread at the school run resuming - not only for the challenge of getting children dressed and out the door on time but because they'll have to face other 'judgmental' mothers again.  

One such thread on netmums.com is entitled 'hate the school run - the mums are so mean!', where members share their horror stories of the cliques they're left out of and the animosity between working and stay-at-home mothers.

Meanwhile, on mumsnet.com, the situation has led to members offering their survival tips for the school run.

One advises: 'Park round the corner from school, so it looks like you've walked' and 'time it so everyone's just going in and you don't have to mingle with the other parents'. Another warns: 'Never go out in your pyjamas, however late you are.'
