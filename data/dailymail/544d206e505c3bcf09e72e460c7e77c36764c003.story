Fourteen million Brits will take to the roads tonight in wet and windy conditions for their annual Christmas getaway.

Commuters were beset by delays as they headed out of London via the M25, and those headed north via the A1 were stopped in their tracks after a lorry caught fire outside Leeds.

The disruptions come as strong winds and rain are predicted over the coming days for those headed home for the festive season. Although those using the transport network this evening were not severely disrupted by the weather, large amounts of rain and gale-force winds could hit those travelling in the coming days.

Forecaster at the Met Office and 
motoring experts at the RAC have warned anybody using the roads for 
their Christmas getaways to be careful.

The worst delays of the evening are thanks to a lorry full of toilet roll caught fire as it drove northbound along the A1. Police and fire services headed to the incident, which took place near Boston Spa in West Yorkshire, north of Leeds.

Debris was spilled over the carriageways as two hose reels battled to put the vehicle out. The road was closed, and the Highway Agency estimated it will not open again until midnight, causing severe delays.

Earlier the agency warned of 'moderate' delays 
of around 40 minutes on the clockwise M25 between junctions J29 and J1A,
 which were not expected to clear until 7.30pm, while other areas of the 
clockwise carriageway are also set for minor delays.

Elsewhere travellers are expected to crowd
 on to trains, boats and planes over Christmas making the next few days 
the busiest days of the year for the Britain's transport system.

However, those hoping for an easy ride could find the journey hampered by a stormy few days.

Parts of western Scotland could see up to
 20in of rain, and 10 to 15in the south-west of England as the unsettled 
outlook continues.

The rest of the UK will also see much
 the same which has led to a series of weather warnings being put in 
place for later with gale force winds and more heavy rain forecast.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams warned that anyone using the roads for their Christmas getaways should be careful.

He
 said: 'Driving conditions won't be good, there will be strong winds 
across the country today and rain. We would advise people to allow extra time for 
their journeys and drive to the conditions.'

He
 added that over the next few days there will be a 'mix of weather 
conditions' until Christmas Eve with the west of Scotland and Wales 
baring the brunt of the wind and the rain, but all areas seeing patches 
of sunshine and temperature above average for the month until late on Tuesday.

By Christmas Day, a band of rain will move in and the temperature drop could mean snow in some areas.

Mr
 Williams said: 'There is a chance of seeing some sleet or snow on 
Christmas Day, but it won't be heavy or widespread. There's just the 
potential and you can't pinpoint where it will be.'

A sizeable chunk of the four million heading abroad for the holiday period are flying from UK airports, with the Canary Islands one of the top destinations.

On the roads, the Highways Agency has either completed or suspended roadworks at a number of sites on England's motorways and major A-roads.

Some works on busy routes, such as sections of the M25 and the M1, are still in place, and motoring organisations say today is likely to be extremely busy.

A RAC spokesman said: 'While it is normally cold that make driving dangerous here we have rain and wind and it will certainly make things difficult. We are expecting around 14 million cars on the road today, up from 11 million on any given day.

'We are advising people to be careful, to drive at the right speed and leave enough time for their journeys.'

Many travellers are heading home for the holiday break by rail. Those using trains over the festive period will have to contend with a number of engineering projects.

Among the routes affected are the Gatwick Express line from Victoria station in London to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex. A major project means that there will be no Gatwick Express services from Christmas Day to the end of New Year's Day.

Travel organisation Abta said today, tomorrow and Sunday are likely to be the busiest days for those flying abroad. The most-popular destinations for sun lovers were the Canary Islands, Tunisia, Morocco and the Cape Verde Islands off western Africa.

For those flying long-haul, Dubai, Mexico, Cuba and Kenya are favourite spots, while for skiers Switzerland, France, Austria and Italy are the top spots.Popular for New Year's Eve breaks are Paris, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Rome and Dublin, Abta said.

For those holidaying in the UK, London and York are popular along with the seaside resorts of Llandudno in North Wales, Torquay and Eastbourne.Abta said around 360,000 travellers would be flying from Stansted over the Christmas period, with around the same number leaving from Manchester, 175,000 from Luton and 100,000 from Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.

Ryanair is carrying a record three million passengers from December 20 to January 6, while Gatwick will handle an estimated two million travellers between December 13 and January 5.

British Airways said just under two million people will fly with the airline between December 16 and January 5, with today being the busiest day with more than 115,000 travellers flying.

Channel Tunnel high-speed rail company Eurostar said it will be carrying more than 420,000 people from December 20 to January 3 - an 11% rise on the same period 12 months ago.

In the UK, an estimated Â£2 billion is being spent on travel to friends and families this Christmas, and the RAC is predicting that 13 million people will take to the roads from December 24 to 26.

Traffic information company Inrix said the busiest time on the roads was likely to be from noon to 5pm today, with the M25 being the most congested spot.Inrix warned that journey times could triple at the busiest festive time, with shopping areas being particularly busy this weekend and again on Friday 27.

VisitEngland said around 20 per cent of the adult population planned to spend at least one night away from home over the festive period, with these trips boosting the UK economy by around Â£1.9 billion.

A spokesman for rail industry organisation the Rail Delivery Group said: 'As fewer passengers travel over the festive period, we can continue one of the biggest programme of improvements in the railway's history while ensuring the vast majority experience no disruption whatsoever.'

A series of accidents on major road routes hampered the getaway this morning. One of the worst-hit areas was the M5 at Bristol, where an overturned van led to long tailbacks.

Other roads where there were hold-ups included the M1 in West Yorkshire and in Leicestershire, the M4 in Berkshire, Wiltshire and south Wales, the M8 in Glasgow, the M25 in Essex, and the A56 at Accrington in Lancashire.

Air traffic control company Nats said around 5,800 flights would be handled today - the busiest day of the festive period - and an increase on the 5,664 aircraft movements on the last Friday before Christmas last year, which was also the busiest day.

Nats, which endured a major technical problem at its Hampshire headquarters causing flight disruption on Saturday December 7, said Saturdays in December had been particularly busy, with many jetting off for skiing holidays.

The company said that air traffic was likely to be reduced between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day with Nats predicting around 1,400 flights on Christmas Day and around 3,900 on both Christmas Eve and Boxing Day.
