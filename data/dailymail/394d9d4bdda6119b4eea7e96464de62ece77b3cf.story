Compare and contrast these two manager quotes about Danny Welbeck from this season.

The uncompromising Louis van Gaal, asked in November whether he still thought it was a good idea to sell the in-form Welbeck to Arsenal on deadline day, said: 'I don't have to prove that [I was right].

'Why do I have to prove that? I have already said what I think - he was not a line-up player, he was more a substitute than a line-up player.

The England striker has been reduced to a bit-part role in recent weeks, spending time on the bench 

Louis van Gaal wrote Welbeck off as not good enough for the Manchester United first team 

'He was already, with different coaches, not a line-up player, but then with Mr Van Gaal, the world is changing? No the world is not changing. They are the facts. They are not my facts, they are the facts of Danny Welbeck.'

And Arsene Wenger, speaking on the impact of Welbeck just the other day: 'He's very important and has played many, many games since the start of the season.

'I think he's played in nearly every single game. His position is one of the three up front, central, left or right. He can play anywhere.'

So Welbeck has apparently gone from a condemned man at Manchester United, destined to rot away on the bench, to a versatile and indispensable part of Arsenal's team.

But, as the England striker returns to Old Trafford for the first time for Monday night's crunch FA Cup sixth-round tie,  has he actually fared that well at the Emirates?

Welbeck was given a chance to impress on United's pre-season tour of the United States 

Well, at the time of Van Gaal's outburst, just ahead of United's away match with Arsenal on November 22, he had every reason to be tetchy.

While United had endured their worst start to a season in living memory, Welbeck had made light of his £16m transfer fee.

Given regular football by Wenger at the head of Arsenal's attack, he looked revitalised, a player brimming with confidence who looked on course to score 20 goals this season for his new team.

Just days after his move, Welbeck scored two for England in their 2-0 European qualifying win in Switzerland, before he opened his Gunners account in a 3-0 win at Aston Villa.

The highlight was a hat-trick in Arsenal's 4-1 Champions League win over Galatasaray, a performance praised by Wenger as 'electric'.

2012-13

2014-15

3 appearances, 0 goals

ARSENAL

2014-15

20 appearances, 7 goals

At that point, it was all looking very awkward for Van Gaal. Events since then have made him feel a little better, if not entirely vindicated.

Welbeck has scored just three more goals for Arsenal since the Galatasaray match.

There have been mitigating circumstances though. Welbeck suffered a thigh injury and missed the whole of January, his absence coinciding with a return to form for Olivier Giroud.

By the time Welbeck had rediscovered his fitness, Wenger found it very difficult to take the Frenchman out of the forward position.

So Welbeck's versatility has become something of a curse. When he plays, he is stuck out on the wing, a position he is less effective in.

When he left for north London, he said: 'I prefer to play through the middle. Once I get into the box and am getting the chances, I have got faith in my ability.'

And, at this pivotal stage of the season, his game time has dried up as well. Arsenal are prospering without him. 

Welbeck's £16m move to Arsenal led to a resurgence in form for England too

Welbeck's last goal for the Gunners came in the win over West Ham just after Christmas

Welbeck was left on the bench during the win over Leicester and he was brought on for mere cameos in the wins over Everton and Queens Park Rangers.

So the 24-year-old returns to Old Trafford with plenty to prove. He believed Arsenal was a club that would advance his career but evidence of this has so far been in short supply.

However, earning Champions League qualification and winning the FA Cup for Arsenal - the two things Van Gaal craves so dearly this season - would certainly make him feel better.
