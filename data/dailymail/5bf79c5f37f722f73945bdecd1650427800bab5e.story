'Everyone is scared to talk about it': Hijab-wearing rapper Mayam Mahmoud (pictured during a performance on Arabs Got Talent) is using her music to tackle the taboo of sexual harassment in the Middle East

Taking a stand: The 18-year-old, who carries a sharp nail for protection, makes clear in one of her raps that 'I won't be the shamed one' and calls on women to shout at harassers the street in the hope others with follow

Her views shot to prominence in October when she first appeared in front of an audience of millions on Arabs Got Talent, where she eventually made it to the semi-finals.

Interest in her music quickly grew and new fans have been posting up to 50 supportive messages on Facebook every day.

But she said it has also provoked a backlash among radicals.

She told the Guardian: 'Some say I'm creating a bad name for Islam. Or even that I'm an infidel.

'It's got a lot of people talking about whether it's possible for a veiled girl, or even a girl, to do this.'

Standing strong: Miss Mahmoud hopes her success in the field of rapping - which is heavily dominated by men - will challenge the way women, and those wearing hijabs in particular, are supposed to behave

Challenging expectations: Miss Mahmoud, pictured at home with her family, started rapping when she was ten years old and news uses her music as vehicle to relay the problems that women face

In one of Mayam Mahmoud's raps, she declares:

'I won't be the shamed one.

'You flirt, you harass and you see nothing wrong with it.

'But even if it's just words, these are not flirts, these are stones.'

She hopes her success in the field of rapping - which is heavily dominated by men - will challenge the way women, and those wearing hijabs in particular, are supposed to behave.

Miss Mahmoud started rapping when she was ten years old after her mother introduced her to poetry.

She told the BBC: 'I was writing poerty first which I later wrote with a faster rhyme. I realised this was called rap.

'I realised all the male rappers must have a track in which they talk about girls and their clothes, blaming girls for everything happening around us.

'That wasn't right, so I rapped about girls and the problems they face.'

According to a UN survey released in April, 99.3 per cent of Egyptian women reported being sexually harassed, causing 91 per cent to be fearful in the street.
