Prince Harry has said Walking With The Wounded adventurers trekking to the South Pole 'can’t wait to get to the end' of their challenge.

But the 29-year-old, who is taking part in the gruelling charity expedition, described how spirits were really high following the decision to suspend the competitive element of the trek.

The Prince was part of a British group racing to the South Pole against teams from the Commonwealth and the US.

Trek: Walking with the Wounded will see the participants trek to the South Pole. All 12 injured service personnel from Britain, America, Canada and Australia have overcome life-changing injuries and undertaken challenging training programmes to prepare themselves for the conditions they will face in Antarctica

But the competition was stopped over the weekend after some of the adventurers, who include injured servicemen and women, became very tired after encountering difficult terrain.

The three teams have now banded together and Harry said they were now just over three days from their goal.

In a voice blog recorded in the frozen waste, he said: 'We are three and a half days from the South Pole. I think it is going to come all pretty quickly to us. We’ve been out here now for about three and half weeks.

'Everyone is in really high spirits. The race obviously got cancelled a couple of days ago - a really good thing that has happened.

'It is nice to see everybody intermingling with each other, not only every night because we camp together, but also during the day.'

Looking ahead to reaching their goal, Harry highlighted fellow adventurer Duncan Slater, who lost both his legs when an improvised explosive device blew up in his vehicle in Afghanistan in 2009.

He said: 'Everyone just can’t wait to get to the end. I think mixed emotions probably, I think some people, for instance Duncan, double amputee, simply doesn’t find walking to the South Pole a big enough challenge, which is why he really enjoyed the race.

'I think everyone back home will appreciate the fact that just being able to walk 100km (62 miles) in these conditions with no legs is a pretty amazing feat in itself.'

In total, 12 injured service personnel who have overcome life-changing injuries are taking part in the expedition organised by the charity Walking With The Wounded.

Trekking around nine to 12 miles (15km to 20km) a day, the group have been pulling their 154lb (70kg) sleds, known as pulks, towards the southernmost point on the globe.

Speaking about the conditions, Harry said: 'The weather is still holding off, which is really nice - it’s about minus 35C (minus 31F) now and 24-hour sunlight, which is nice in these tents to keep us warm at night.”

Prince Harry backed organisers who called off the race element of the trek for safety reasons.

Harry and his fellow Walking With The Wounded expedition competitors began the race in temperatures of -27:C, with a wind chill dropping it to -35:C - and those conditions have continued.

But with the fear that competitors were pushing themselves too hard in the harsh conditions the race element was called off at the weekend.

Harry’s team were leading the event which began last Sunday - after it had been shortened by 37 miles because of the weather-inflicted delays.

But on the fifth day of the challenge, as the teams arrived at their first checkpoint, it became 'obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the team members, the harsh reality of the Antarctic was starting to take its toll,' said the organisers in a statement.
