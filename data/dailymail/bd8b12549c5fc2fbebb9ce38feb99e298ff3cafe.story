Hells Angels boss Peter 'Skitzo' Hewat has appeared in court after being allegedly caught with Viagra pills.

Victorian bikie Hewat was out on bail when he was arrested by anti-bikie police in Melbourne suburb Craigieburn on Wednesday. 

The outlaw motorcycle gang's East County sergeant-at-arms appeared in an out-of-sessions court charged with 44 counts of driving while suspended, breach of bail, possessing a dangerous article, resisting arrest and possessing a schedule-four poison.

Hewat was stopped by police when he was being driven through Melbourne suburb Craigieburn on Wednesday 

Police said when they stopped Hewat they found a baseball bat under the driver's seat of Hewat's car, as well as four tablets of Sildenafil, known as Viagra. 

Hewat was in the passenger seat when it was intercepted by detectives from the anti-bikie Echo taskforce following an investigation into his towing business and a number of raids on his home and that of his son, reports the Herald Sun. 

Earlier this year the 59-year-old, of Mountain View Lane, Mickelham, had his driver's licence suspended and was ordered not to leave his home from 9pm and 6am.

Detective Acting Sergeant Chris O’Brien told the out-of-sessions court hearing CCTV footage seized from the home of Mr Hewat's son, Beau Hewat, shows the Hells Angels member driving to and from the home a total of 44 times between August 2 and September 6, reports The Age.

Police claim on four occasions he was captured on video arriving at the premises outside curfew hours.

A last charge of handling stolen goods relates to missing wheels from an allegedly stolen Mitsubishi Triton recovered at Beau Hewat's address.  

Mr Hewat told the bail justice he should be freed because he was a hard-working businessman and needed to care for his sick wife, reports the Herald Sun.  

He said: 'She's been in and out of hospital when I'm not there because she can't self-medicate properly,' reports The Age.

Acting Sgt O'Brien said it was his understanding Mr Hewat's wife had been living at their son's house.

Mr Hewat said his wife was often at their son's home because he had a problem with amphetamines. 'We're just trying to get him off them and keep people away from there.'

Hewat's home and business were also searched on Wednesday as part of an ongoing Echo Task Force investigation. 

The court heard because Mr Hewat was already on bail, he should be remanded in custody until Thursday morning, where he was due reappear before court.
