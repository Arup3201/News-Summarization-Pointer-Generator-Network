An American woman has been gang-raped by three men in India while hitchhiking back to a guest house, police announced today.

The 30-year-old was picked up this morning by men in a truck and then attacked as she made her way home after visiting a friend.

It comes just one day after it emerged a 21-year-old Irish charity worker was allegedly drugged and raped while volunteering with an aid agency in Kolkata.

They are the latest in a spate of 
sexual assaults on foreign women in India that have led to safety 
warnings and a drop in the number of female tourists travelling to the 
country.

The American woman said three men in the truck drove to a secluded spot in the northern Indian resort of Manali and raped her.

She went to police to report the attack and Mr Singh said no arrests had yet been made.

Authorities issued an alert for the three men and set up roadblocks to check any trucks leaving the town, he said.

The Irish charity worker told police officers she was raped while semi-conscious after drinking a cup of tea following a birthday party on Saturday night.

Indian police have arrested Indian businessman Sujoy Mitra, 35, and he has been remanded in custody until later this week. 

‘We suspect the accused laced the tea with drugs and raped the Irish woman,’ police officer Subrata Dey said.

Local media said Mitra brought the woman to his house in the Kalighat area of the city after a night out.

He appeared in court in Alipore on Sunday for a preliminary hearing and denies the allegations.

The number of high-profile rape cases in India have sparked passionate protests and seen a drop in the number of women tourists travelling to the country over safety fears

A lawyer for the accused, Dibyendu 
Bhattachrya, told local media: ‘After accompanying him to his house, the
 lady stayed with him for nearly two hours and even had breakfast. The 
allegations are totally false and motivated. My client is a 
teetotaller.’

The alleged 
attacks are the latest cases of sexual assaults on foreign women in 
India that have led to warnings about women travelling to the country. 

A spokesman for the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to the woman.

It is understood diplomatic staff were notified of the case at the weekend and officials from the embassy in New Delhi are dealing with it.

IndiaToday reported that the woman had been in India working with an NGO based in Darjeeling.

Tourists travelling to India have dropped by 25 per cent since the high-profile rape and murder of an Indian student in New Delhi.

The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, a study found, following warnings about safety in the country.

The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs has advised women going to India to exercise caution.

Its website says women should not 
travel alone and be careful when selecting accommodation, and as 
recently as May 21 it updated information on the risks involved.

It warns: 'Tourists have been the 
victims of sexual assault in Agra, Goa, Delhi, Bangalore, Madyha Pradesh
 and Rajasthan. Women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the
 form of verbal and physical harassment.

'Women travellers should exercise caution when travelling in India.'

A Swiss woman was gang-raped during a cycling holiday in central India with her husband in March.

A South Korean tourist was allegedly drugged and raped in the same state in January by the son of the owner of a hotel where she was staying.

Also in January, a British woman leaped from her hotel room balcony in Agra, where she was visiting the Taj Mahal, when she feared being sexually assaulted by a member of her hotel staff.

The assaults come amid heightened concern about sexual assaults in India
 that followed the fatal gang-rape of a young woman on a moving bus in 
New Delhi in December.

That rape sparked public protests demanding better protection for women.

In response, the government passed a law increasing prison terms for 
rape and providing for the death penalty in cases of rape that result in
 death or leave the victim in a coma. It also made voyeurism, stalking, 
acid attacks and the trafficking of women punishable under criminal law.
