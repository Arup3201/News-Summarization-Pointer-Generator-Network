For as long as she can remember Kazzie Mahina has loved the water. Childhood friends hold fond memories of swimming at the beach and in pools all summer long with Mahina, pretending they were mermaids in their own underwater world.

Now many years later the 37-year-old has fully realised her dream of being a 'real-life mermaid' featuring in film clips, campaigns and performing around the world.

The 37-year-old, from Byron Bay on the NSW far-north coast also runs her own brand which creates 'Merfins', flippers in the shape of a mermaid tail which allow kids and adults alike to streak through the ocean like an underwater creature.

Kazzie Mahina has loved the ocean as long as she can remember, and used to pretend she was a mermaid

'I've loved the water as long back as I can remember and I just always felt a sense of being at home,' Mahina told Daily Mail Australia.

'I feel at peace and connected mostly to myself... I just remember having that feeling ever since I was little.'

Setting off travelling in her 20s, Mahina had a dolphin tail she had made for a commercial that she carried along with her for the entirety of her adventures across India, Europe the USA and beyond.

'I just roamed the world and was just swimming everywhere with this tail', Mahina said.

'It was on this trip that the dream came to me that this was something I wanted to share with other people.

One of Mahina's most memorable stunts was when she dove with sharks at an aquarium, all while she was pregnant with her son Makoa

'My dream had totally come true and I was completely wrapped it what I was doing but I also loved spreading joy to others,' the mermaid continued.

From here - under the guidance of a man who was both and mentor and 'grandfather figure' to the 37-year-old who insisted she chase her dreams - Mahina began making the tails.

She can hold her breath underwater for more than five minutes and has worked as a mermaid at birthday parties, weddings, corporate events, features in film clips and even in advertising campaigns.

Mahina said she has big plans in the works with another product set to be released in time for next summer

But one of Mahina's most memorable stunts was when she dove with sharks at an aquarium as part of a school trip, all while she was pregnant with her son Makoa.

'I was six months pregnant and very ill with the flu and I had to do a swim in a New Zealand aquarium,' she said.

'It's really not as graceful and easy as it may look .... There was sharks all around and other objects and I all had to go on was the divers telling me what to avoid,' she added saying the water was so murky she couldn't see in front of her.

Despite the freezing cold, dangerous animals and lack of vision Mahina managed to pull off the stunt perfectly, and despite being into her second trimester was not even showing.

'I think my little boy must have tucked himself up tight in my tummy that day', she laughed.

The mermaid also made an appearance in Red Foo's music video for Let's Get Ridiculous, where she had to dive very deep down into freezing water.

But aside from all the fun Mahina has performing, diving with sea life is her real passion.

'It's not so much performance based but about deeply connecting with sea life.'

She has travelled to Tonga and said the experiences she shared in those water with mother whales and their calves are some of the ones she holds dearest.

Mahina said she has had many 'powerful' and moving moments swimming in the ocean with the creatures and it is here she feels most at ease.

So that others could share her love of the ocean and the underwater world Mahina founded Mahina Mermaids, a company which makes mermaid fins.

'I started designing the films in the middle of 2006 ... I went through lots of samples, prototypes, lots of trial and error,' she said,

'People now would go "oh that seems to obvious" or "it looks so simple" but it wasn't back then.'

In 2011 launched the website and started selling the Merfins out of Australia, and by the next year they were in stores around the country.

'In 2012 we got into stores in Australia - that was our first year on the marketplace and we got voted best seller in retailer's stores,' Mahina said.

Shortly after they were 'hunted down' by US retailer Urban Outfitters, who chased the brand for an adult range of the fins.

'They hunted me, they wouldn't leave me alone. I was like 'what is going on this is one of the coolest stores in America,' the mermaid revealed.

Mahina is also heavily involved with conservation through her brand, a frequently organises and takes part in beach clean ups with her 'merpod ocean tribe'.

'I have a merpod ocean tribe and that is like a bunch of local kids when I live and we do beach cleanups where we work in conjunbction with Tangaroa View Ocean Society,' Mahina revealed.

'It's not just about clenaing but also recording what you find so studies can be done about how and why stuff ends up there.

'It's not just about picking up the problem but going back trying to find the solution before it happens again,' she added.

'It's teaching little kids to be more self-responsible and take care of our special ocean.'

'Sometimes I pinch myself and say how did it work out that I am the luckiest girl in the world.

'Dreams and ideas belong to the world they don't belong to any one person and anybody could tap into them and I think I just happened to be connected and passionate and listening enough.

'The mermaiding is lots of fun, and the gift of being able to give that gift of fun ... my fun is just multiplying to more I know that other people are enjoying themselves.
