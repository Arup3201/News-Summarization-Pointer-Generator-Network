Beleaguered savers faced a new nightmare yesterday as 12 banks and building societies had their credit ratings downgraded.

Those with large amounts of savings were urged to move their money to safe havens amid fears that some banks could go under.

Just a day after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said the world was facing its worst ever financial crisis, Moody’s Investor Service slashed the 
ratings of Lloyds, Santander, RBS, the Co-operative Bank, the Nationwide
building society and seven smaller societies.

Downgrades

The downgrade saw their share prices tumble.

It is also likely to drive up borrowing costs and starve businesses of credit.

That prospect sparked Liberal Democrat calls for RBS to be totally nationalised and forced to lend to small firms.

Whitehall insiders warned that the bank might need another state bailout
to pass ‘stress tests’ being conducted by the European Union.

To add to the panic, another credit rating agency, Fitch, downgraded the
prospects of Italy and Spain, describing the economic outlook for both 
as ‘negative’.

That increased the chance of Europe’s third and fourth 
biggest economies needing massive loans.

UK taxpayers have already contributed £12.5billion to a £235billion fund to prop up Greece, Portugal and Ireland.

The Fitch downgrade will pile greater pressure on British banks, which 
are heavily exposed to other financial institutions in the troubled 
eurozone.

Moody’s said the downgrades followed the Government telling the banks to
stand on their own two feet rather than rely in future on taxpayer 
bailouts.

The agency said it believes the institutions are now at 
greater risk of needing financial help.

RBS and Lloyds TSB – which both received handouts – saw their shares drop by more than 3 per cent.

Moody’s said the downgrade was not a sign the banks’ situation had 
deteriorated.

ALEX
BRUMMER: 'From the Government’s point of view the most worrying of the 
UK bank downgrades will be Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking 
Group, in which they hold 82pc and 40pc stakes respectively. Customers 
on the high street looking for the safest place to deposit their money 
face hard decisions too, as trusted names such as the Co-operative, 
Nationwide and Santander are also downgraded. The wise depositor should 
now seek to spread their savings as widely as possible and not 
necessarily just chase the best return.'

But the change is likely to drive up the cost of 
borrowing, hitting small firms already starved of cash.

Last night Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close ally of Business 
Secretary Vince Cable, said: ‘We must now nationalise RBS to do the job 
our nation needs.

‘Taxpayers own 82 per cent of the shares but we’re getting the worst of 
all worlds because the Treasury hides behind outside shareholders 
instead of controlling lending and bonuses.

RBS is the worst culprit, 
starving viable small businesses of the credit they need to grow.

‘They can’t wait for the Treasury  to dream up fancy new financial  
structures – they just want them to pull the stuck lending levers now 
right under their noses, starting with RBS.’

George Osborne insisted the
Government’s calls for the banks to hold more cash had helped protect 
them from the worst of the financial whirlwhind.

The Chancellor said Britain was ‘out of the eye of the storm’, adding: 
‘I am confident that British banks are well capitalised, they are 
liquid, they aren’t experiencing the kind of problems that some of the 
banks in the eurozone are experiencing.’

But experts warned those with savings of more than £85,000 to divide 
their money between institutions. The sum is the maximum guarantee for 
each separately-registered bank or building society under a government 
compensation scheme.

Jason Riddle, founder of campaign group Save our Savers, said: ‘The 
downgrade of 12 banks and building societies will further undermine 
savers’ faith in the banking system.

Double-dip recession fears in the U.S. eased today after a better-than-anticipated jobs report for September.

U.S.
firms created 103,000 jobs, against economist expectations of 60,000, 
but the additional hiring was not enough to lift the overall 
unemployment rate, which stayed at 9.1 per cent for the third month in a
row.

The data gave 
markets across Europe a modest boost with the FTSE 100 Index up more 
than 70 points soon after the figures were released, though the UK's top
flight eased back subsequently.

Andrew
Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said: 
'In the big picture, today's reading soothes recessionary fears.'

Companies
with large U.S. businesses led the rally. Building supplies firm 
Wolseley, which generates 40 per cent of revenues in the country, topped
the FTSE 100 risers while there were also good gains for Holiday Inn 
and Crowne Plaza hotel group InterContinental.

The
US labour department also raised its estimates for the number of jobs 
created in the previous two months. Non-farm payrolls, or new jobs 
added, rose by 57,000 in August and by 127,000 in July, according to the
revised data.

‘Most people’s savings will be more than adequately covered by the government guarantee.

‘But anyone with more would be well advised to spread their money over 
several institutions which are separately registered for the 
compensation scheme.’

Kevin Mountford, of the comparison site Moneysupermarket.com, said: 
‘Savers will be nervous on banks and building societies being 
downgraded.

‘The savings environment is increasingly challenging for  savers looking for security and good rates.

‘But they should not panic and take money out of banks and put it under 
the mattress.

'Their money is protected by the government compensation 
scheme.’

Established in 1900, Moody’s vies with Standard & Poor’s as the 
world’s biggest credit ratings agency.

'It is a public company listed on 
the New York Stock Exchange and legendary investor Warren  Buffett is 
the biggest shareholder with a stake of 13 per cent.

Moody’s failed to raise the alarm in the run-up to the financial crash.

Lehman Brothers and AIG both enjoyed top-notch ratings from the agency 
before they nosedived in 2008.

Fitch, which was set up in New York in 1913, is the smallest of the big three credit ratings agencies.
It merged with UK-based rival IBCA in 1997.

What are bank credit ratings?

Three big agencies – Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch – analyse the balance sheets and trading environments of financial institutions on a regular basis so that investors, depositors, and the Government can make a judgements as to their stability. The top-notch rating is AAA.Why are they important?

They determine how easily the bank or building society can obtain loans on the money markets and therefore maintain cash-flow, or liquidity. But almost as importantly they affect the general perception of how safe an institution is.So Moody’s is saying these banks and building societies are now less safe?

Well, sort-of: it is saying that they are less likely to receive capital injections from the public purse in a crisis. Smaller building societies are likely to come out of this analysis badly because they are small enough for the Government to allow them to fail if they get into financial difficulties.

But the report also implies that now – unlike during the financial crisis when the Government came to the rescue of stricken banking giants like Lloyds and RBS – no bank is too big to fail. The Nationwide, which has been downgraded, is the biggest mutual in the UK.But by saying this Moody’s is in itself making them less safe?

Yes, there’s a perverse logic at work. Governments might be less willing to jump in to help an institution with a poorer credit rating, and depositors and investors may start to avoid them.Can we trust these agencies?

Many people think not. They did not come particularly well out of the financial crisis, when they failed to spot the massive weaknesses in big world banks’ balanced sheets caused by the trading in sub-prime mortgage debt.Perhaps chastened by that experience, some suspect now that they are too trigger happy in their judgements on banks.What will be the immediate impact?

The direct impact may be minimal. Banks obtain their funding from a variety of sources including long-term bonds which will now be more expensive. Moreover, the new round of quantitative easing announced by the Bank of England, which could reach a total of £300bn in fresh cash, should ensure that the high street banks can sell securities to the Bank for cash. So mortgage, loan and card borrowers should hopefully not see rates rise or credit harder to come by.So what does it mean for savers?

Customers on the high street looking for the safest placed to deposit their money have traditionally faced tricky choices, and many were caught out by the collapse of Northern Rock in September 2007.But Government guarantees mean ordinary depositors are protected up to £85,000 (£170,000 for joint accounts) at each separate institution where they hold deposits. Those worried about private sector banks might consider National Savings bonds, savings accounts or Premium Bonds – which are directly guaranteed by the government – as possible homes for spare cash.
