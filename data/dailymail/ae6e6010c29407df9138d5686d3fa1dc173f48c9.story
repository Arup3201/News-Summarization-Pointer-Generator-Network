Supermum: An investigation is underway after Nicky Stevens was found stabbed

A woman described as a 'supermum' was rushed to hospital yesterday after being found covered in blood after being stabbed.

Mother-of-six Nicky Stevens, 38, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, was discovered shortly before 9am yesterday by Chris Lippett, who had been called to a flat to board up a broken window.

He immediately called an 
ambulance and tried to stop the bleeding while they waited for it to 
arrive.

Mr Lippett said: 'I got called out to board the window up because someone had put it through.

'I went to get the board and when I came back Nicky said 'I have been stabbed'. She was covered in blood.

'I
ran over to her and I tried to lie her down. One of the tenants brought
a towel and I tried to wrap it around the wound but blood was pumping 
out too quickly.

'I was just trying to comfort her while the ambulance arrived.'

He added: 'It was very alarming, I just tried to keep the pressure applied and kept her as calm as possible.

'She was still conscious when she was taken to hospital.'

Last year Ms Stevens was labelled a 
'supermum' by her local paper in recognition of her tireless work 
looking raising six children.

The youngest, Chantelle, was born with hip dysplasia and spent six months in a cast.

Kimberley Villis, of Low White Close, was among the first on the scene.

She said: 'Chris was great. We heard someone shouting and went out onto the street. What he did was fantastic.'

Ms
Stevens' friend, Fiona Jones said: 'I have known her for more than 20 
years and she always puts other people first, including helping me look 
after my little one when I was struggling.'

Ms Stevens who lives in the Millbank area of the town, was taken to Furness General Hospital for treatment. Her injuries are not thought to have been life-threatening.

Investigation: Armed officers and dog handlers were called to the scene in Barrow-in-Furness
