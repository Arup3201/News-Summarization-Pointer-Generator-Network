When Peter Phillips decided he wanted to hold a prestigious showjumping event in the grounds of Kensington Palace, he probably thought he would run into little difficulty.

After all, not only is he the Queen's grandson, but he is also a cousin to the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, who have their residences there.

However, the 35-year-old did not account for the local council.

Mr Phillips wanted to bring the Global Champions Tour to Kensington Gardens in June. The showjumping event would feature 30 of the world's top riders and would have taken over part of the West London park for a month.

However, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council refused him planning permission for the event because it decided  it would have a detrimental effect on the home of his own family members.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Phillips said:  'We are extremely disappointed but we are determined that we are going to run the Global Champions Tour in the UK in 2013 and we are looking at a number of potential venues that we will confirm shortly.

'It is a shame that we can't do it in the centre of London but it is still a fantastic series.'

Concerns: Despite being a family member, the council felt that Mr Phillips event would have a detrimental affect on the home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

The council said the event would fail to preserve or enhance the Kensington Palace setting or the character of the area.

A petition and 300 objections from residents was sent to the council along with just four letters of support.

The proposal which went before the council involved 292 horses being stabled in the park along with a 3,200 seat arena and hospitality marquees for 700 people.

According to the Daily Telegraph, a spokesman for the council said part of the reason permission was refused was because the park took longer than expected to recover from a temporary theatre which was put up last year.

It is also believed the council did not want to set a precedent for events to be held in the park every year.
