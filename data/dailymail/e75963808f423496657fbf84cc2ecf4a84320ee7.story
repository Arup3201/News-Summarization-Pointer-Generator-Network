Family Feud host Grant Denyer caused an uproar during Tuesday night's episode of the game show when he posed a controversial question about cyclists.

As the question 'What is something annoying that cyclists might do?' flashed up on the screen, the cycling community went into meltdown on social media, deeming it 'disgusting' and swearing off the show forever.

The premise of the show is to pick the most common answers as decided by a survey, as two families battle it out for the most points.

Game show Family Feud sent social media into a frenzy on Tuesday night when it asked the question 'What is something  annoying that cyclists might do?' 

The most popular answer was 'Taking driving lane' as guessed by one of the contestants, followed by 'Cut you off' and the very unpopular 'Everything'. 

'Run red light', 'Pull out in front', 'Ride slowly' and 'Ring bell' also made it into the top  answers much to the dismay of cyclists on social media.

'Wear lycra' was the last answer to round out the top eight - a hot topic in the media in recent weeks after a pub banned men wearing lycra from entering their premises.

Social media was alight with heated discussion following the airing of the Family Feud episode, with Tim Bates writing on Facebook that he wasn't normally a viewer but now will actively avoid the show. 

The top answer was 'Taking the driving lane' with 'Wearing lycra' also appearing on the list

Facebook users were very unimpressed with the question, taking to the Family Feud  page to complain

Safe Cycling Australia tweeted that the Channel Ten program was 'bloody pathetic'

'Don't normally watch this show, but turned on to hear "something annoying cyclists do",' he wrote.

As someone who was recently physically assaulted for nothing more than riding a bike, I'd like to know why Family Feud and Channel 10 are encouraging that sort of stupidity towards cyclists.... The fact the answer "everything" was even allowed as an answer is disgusting!' Mr Bates continued.

Meantime Rachel Lee said the family game show had just lost a long-term fan. 

'So disgusted by the cyclist question - im not watching anymore and i really liked the show.' 

Trent posted that the move was 'absolutely disgusting' and asked who approved the segment

Sue Chapple pointed out that many children ride bicycles too 

'A purportedly family friendly TV show promoting hate and ill-will towards vulnerable road users. Absolutely disgraceful', Lauren Michelle wrote, demanding a 'formal written and on-air apology'.  

Twitter was equally unimpressed with the show's question, with @AusCycle tweeting about the episode.

Trent posted that the move was 'absolutely disgusting' and asked who approved the segment, while Safe Cycling Australia called it 'bloody pathetic'.

Family Feud was in hot water and called 'sexist' when they asked an outdated question about jobs for women which included answers such as 'cooking' and 'cleaning'.
