Senior female directors – dubbed 'golden skirts' – are damaging feminism by only campaigning for the elite, it has been claimed.

A top academic claimed female boardroom executives had hijacked women's rights and campaigned for 'incredibly limited' causes to further their own careers.

Professor Alison Wolf, a crossbench peer and economist at King's College London, said the rich, highly-educated women had a 'modern obsession' with the number of women in boardrooms or in Parliament.

Meanwhile, issues such as domestic violence, forced marriage and poorly-paid shift work was ignored, in what she branded a 'betrayal of feminism'.

In a damning critique, she accused the richest 15 per cent of women of 'pulling away' from the rest of the sisterhood.

Baroness Wolf of Dulwich told The Times: 'It is a betrayal of what early feminism was all about.

'Modern feminism should be far more concerned about the lives of people who did not go to university, who are working long hours in low-paid jobs, doing shift work or struggling to hold down a job, in forced marriages or living in domestic environments which are hostile.

'Sisterhood is dead. There is a complete preoccupation in feminism with the economic self-interest of the top people, whether it's boards or parliament.'

She said 'golden skirts' – a Norwegian term for women who hold multiple positions on company boards – were failing to have a positive effect on the pay or prospects of ordinary working women.

Lady Wolf said: 'We know this because Norway has actually been running a real life experiment and proves the point.'

She claimed that Norway's requirement for publicly listed companies to have 40 per cent women on their boards had had little impact on wider women's rights.

In a book called The XX factor, published two years ago, Lady Wolf claimed that, while the female elite may have conquered sex discrimination, poorer women had been left behind

In a book called The XX factor, published two years ago, Lady Wolf claimed that, while the female elite may have conquered sex discrimination, poorer women had been left behind.

She added: 'There has been an obsession with what is going on at Oxford or Berkeley because it involves 'people like us'.

'But those on the receiving end are not the top 15 per cent and university campuses are not the most dangerous places on earth to be a woman, really they are not.'

Leading feminists attacked Lady Wolf's views, claiming there were many grassroots campaigns for women's rights.

Caroline Criado-Perez, whose campaign for a woman to appear on a bank note led to Jane Austen being selected for a £10 note, said: 'There is an explosion of feminism at all levels of society and all over the world.

'Also, it is naive to think it doesn't matter who is in the boardroom or in parliament. We are a democracy and who holds power affects us all.'

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman also objected to Lady Wolf's criticism of so-called 'golden skirts', telling The Times: 'The women's movement has always been a coalition with women from every walk of life, from the blue stocking Vera Brittain types to the Dagenham campaigners for equal pay. But they all want to tackle inequality.'
