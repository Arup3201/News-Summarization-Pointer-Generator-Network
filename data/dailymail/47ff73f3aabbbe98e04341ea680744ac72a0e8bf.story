Tube trains to the Olympic Park were suspended this morning.

Spectators travelling to Stratford on the Central line at around 7am were told all services were terminating at Liverpool Street due to an incident at Leyton.

A defective westbound train was awaiting the arrival of the London Fire Brigade, a train driver said.

Fire alert: A driver smelled smoke on a train at Leyton resulting in the part closure of the central line

At least four fire engines and the British Transport Police arrived at Leyton station, and the Central line service between Liverpool Street and Woodford/Newbury Park did not reopen until 10am, with severe delays remaining on the line.

A number of passengers at Leyton were forced to wait in the dismal weather for buses to get to their destinations.

The fire alert meant there was no service for a large part of the Central line, and on the branch of the line that remained open there was severe delays. 

A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said this morning: 'The suspension is due to a train being taken out of service at Leyton after the driver reported smelling smoke. 

'This has been investigated and all passengers left the train and station without reported problems.'

Station announcers at Bank told passengers there were reports of a fire on board the train.

Not in the rain! Passengers were forced to wait in the bad weather for replacement buses to their destinations

TfL advised Olympic spectators to use other Tube and main line services to reach Stratford, including the Underground's Jubilee line, the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway.

To add to the Olympic travel problems, rail services in and out of Liverpool Street main line station were disrupted due to an overhead wire problem between Elsenham and Stansted Mountfitchet in Essex.

This was affecting travellers on services run by the Greater Anglia and CrossCountry train companies.

The problems around Liverpool Street come on another busy day for public transport as the first weekday evening football match takes place at Wembley Stadium.

This is only one of a number of Olympic events taking place in the capital, with Transport for London (TfL) advising that London is expected to be exceptionally busy throughout the day.

Final destination: Many people were struggling to get to the Olympic Park in Stratford to watch the Games

TfL said people were heeding advice to avoid London if possible.It added that while Tube journeys were up 4 per cent yesterday, road journeys in London were down by 20 per cent.

London’s Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Public transport in general, and the Jubilee line in particular, will be exceptionally busy today as spectators make their way to events at key Olympic venues across the capital.

Struggle: Passengers travelling to the Netherlands' 3-2 hockey victory over Japan earlier this morning will have been pushed to make the event on time

'We are very grateful to customers for following our advice to avoid London Bridge station and for major businesses who are enabling their staff to work flexibly during the Games.

'Our advice to all users of the transport network continues to be to plan ahead, avoid hotspot areas, and leave plenty of time for your journey.'

One passenger, who was forced to wait for a bus in the pouring rain to get to work, described the situation as 'absolute chaos'.

She said: 'The train was packed to capacity as there were lots people on the way to the Olympics, including people in the Games uniform.

Coping: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt claims the transport network in London is 'coping incredibly well' with the Olympics

'It stopped initially for about 10 minutes and then we were told it was suspended at Leyton due to a fire alert.

'So many families with young children who were not from England were panicking about how to get to Stratford and couldn’t work out the best route.

'People were queuing in the pouring rain and the local cab rank was full of ticket-holders desperately trying to get to the Olympic park.  Not a good impression for London!’

The Central line was not the only section of the Tube network to suffer problems. Heathrow Terminals 1,2 & 3 station was closed for around 20 minutes due to yet another fire alert.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed that the transport network has 'coped incredibly well', despite the Central line grinding to a halt earlier for three hours.

He said: 'The Central line is up and running.

'It's a totally normal feature of London's transport network which, let's face it, this is the first Tube network in the world - something we are very proud of - but (it is) also something that gives us challenges.

'But the question is how do people cope? Did people get to the Olympic Park on time? Did people get to their events on time?

'Systems were put in place... and the systems worked. Overall things are very much on track at this stage of the Games.'

He said the 'real success' of the Games was that fears of the capital's transport grinding to a halt had not been realised, adding that it 'coped incredibly well'.

The RMT union claimed that a likely cause of the closure is Leyton train's brakes seizing up

He added: 'The reason it has coped is because Londoners have listened to the messages, we've got lots of people who are working from home.

'Actual overall traffic numbers on the transport network are four per cent up compared to a normal summer, but it's working extremely well.'

Meanwhile the RMT transport union called for an immediate investigation into 'the real impact of cuts to fleet maintenance schedules' following the Central line incident.

The union claimed that the likely cause of today's part-closure are the Leyton train's brakes seizing up.

This afternoon there were minor problems on the Tube, as a signal failure led to minor delays on the Docklands Light Railway - another link to the Olympic Park.

A more significant worrying for Olympic organisers is this afternoon's closure of the Southeastern Javelin - the high-speed Games rail service - between Ebbsfleet and Stratford International stations.

The service was suspended for around two hours, and spectators - depending on where they were travelling from - were forced to use the Greater Anglia trains, get either underground services to West Ham or overground services from Liverpool Street this afternoon in order to get to the events on time.

There was severe delays between Stratford and St Pancras, but normal service has since resumed.
