Syrian expert Elizabeth O'Bagy, who was sacked after lying about having a PhD, has apologised for misleading people

A expert on Syria whose work was quoted by senior politicians as they debated military action has finally admitted she that she lied over her degree and said sorry.

A week after she was sacked from her job as an analyst with the Institute of War, Elizabeth O'Bagy has said that not only did she not earn a doctorate from Georgetown University, but she never even attended the PhD program there.

And the researcher, whose op-ed in the Wall Street Journal was cited by Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator John McCain in discussions over whether to launch a missile strike on Syria, has apologised for her 'many mistakes' and 'extremely poor judgement'.

O'Bagy, who was hired by the Institute of War a year ago as a research analyst, wrote an opinion piece in the WSJ on 30 August entitled On The Front Lines Of Syria's Civil War.

In the article she said rebels in Syria were divided into distinct groups: moderate and extreme - a key point in the debate over whether to intervene in the war-torn country.

Kerry and McCain agreed that Syria was a secular state and hailed her op-ed as evidence that the rebels were not the jihadists that some were suggesting.Â  McCain even said her article was 'important'.

However a week after the article was published it emerged that O'Bagy was affiliated to the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a group that supports the removal of Assad from power, and that she had connections with rebel groups in the country.

When it was subsequently discovered that O'Bagy had not received a doctorate as she had claimed, she was fired from the Institute of War, although her employers were still under the impression that she had attended the course and had simply not completed her disseration.

Last night, however, the controversial analyst admitted that she had not even attended the PhD program in Georgetown at all.

Secretary of State John Kerry and Senator John McCain both cited O'Bagy's op-ed on the Syrian rebels

She told the Daily Beast she was only enrolled in a master's program at the university and had applied to join the MA/Ph.D course but was never accepted.

In a statement to the website, O'Bagy said: 'I would like to deeply apologize to every person with whom I have worked, who has read and depended upon my research, and to the general public.

'While I have made many mistakes and showed extremely poor judgment, I most particularly regret my public misrepresentation of my educational status and not immediately disclosing that I had not been awarded a doctorate in May, 2013.'

She apologized to colleagues and others she had misled, adding: 'Their anger and distrust is understandable, however, I never intended to willfully deceive anyone.'

O'Bagy, who has also now left the SETF as a result of the exposed deception, said that she still stood by her work on Syria.
