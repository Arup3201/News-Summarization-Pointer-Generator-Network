From the moment it was announced last August, Barbie's new $2million deal with Girl Scouts stirred up protest for being 'insidious' and 'product placement at its worst.'

And this week, amid re-ignited controversy, Mattel's Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll finally hits stores. Sporting a bright pink and green Girl Scouts uniform, and complete with sassy high-heeled hiking boots, she also debuts the first corporately sponsored uniform patch in Girl Scouts' history.

'Barbie is basically a terrible role model for girls,' Dr Susan Linn, founder of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood told NBC's Today show. 'She's not about what the Girl Scouts' principles are, which have to do with leadership and courage.'

Ms Linn, a psychologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School, is at the forefront of the protest against the Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll; having already tried and failed to get the Girl Scouts organization to drop the partnership last year.

'Holding Barbie, the quintessential fashion doll, up as a role model for Girl Scouts simultaneously sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts’ vital mission to build "girls of courage, confidence and character,"' said Ms Linn.

The Barbie Loves Girl Scouts doll, which is available as a blonde, brunette or as an African-American, comes alongside an activity book and carries a tote which reads: 'Goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills, business ethics.'

The range: The consumer group claims that Barbie 'sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts’ vital mission to build "girls of courage, confidence and character'

It also comes with a Girl Scouts uniform patch bearing the slogan: 'Be anything, do everything.'

Aimed
 at six to eight-year-olds, it is not typical of the organization's usual
 patches in that it can be purchased, rather than being 'earned.'

But
 Girl Scouts' chief communications executive maintained that its deal 
with Mattel will be a great thing for the 102-year-old organization, 
which aims to 'make the world a better place,' according to its mission 
statement.

'Girls and moms alike associate this doll with the outdoors, camping, giving back in your community,' she said.

'We think that those are really positive messages to be sending to all of our girls.'

Notably,
 the Girl Scouts secured a healthy $2million of funding from Mattel as 
part of the deal - albeit to implement Barbie-themed initiatives - at a 
time when the organization was forced to shed a quarter of its workforce
 due to financial woes.

For
 Mattel, the brand insisted that its partnership with Girl Scouts was a 
'good fit,' claiming it was 'inspiring girls' imagination and showing 
them they can become anything they want to be.'

And Barbie has certainly been a lot of things. In her 55 years as one of most influential dolls in American history, she has been outfitted for more than 135 different jobs, one of the more recent being Entrepreneur Barbie, released last week.

Designed by Mattel with the assistance of eight real-life female entrepreneurs, the $12.99 tech-savvy doll comes equipped with a tablet, a smartphone and a laptop case, is now available on Amazon.

The Barbie Loves Girls Scouts doll hits shelves this week, and although its official recommended retail price has not yet been revealed, it is already available from select sellers on Amazon, priced at $59.99 for the African-American doll, $66.95 for the brunette, and $69.95 for the blonde.
