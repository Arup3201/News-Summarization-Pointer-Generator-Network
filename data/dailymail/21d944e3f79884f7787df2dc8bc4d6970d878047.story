Thousands of employees at companies owned by billionaire Republican fundraisers were told to vote for Mitt Romney in packet mailed to them warning of the dangers of an Obama re-election.

The mailer is easily traced back to David and Charles Koch, the notorious multi-billionaire brothers who have largely financed the Tea Party movement and served as effective Romney bundlers.

In These Times released excerpts from a letter sent to 45,000 employees at Georgia Pacific- a Koch-owned paper company based in Washington state- that was signed by the company's CEO Dave Robertson.

This is the third time in the past week that the head of a major corporation sent out a letter pressuring employees to vote for Romney in the upcoming election.

Brothers in charge: Charles (left) and David Koch (right) have supplied billions in political funding to conservative Republican candidates and have now told their employees who to vote for

'While we are typically told before each Presidential election that it is important and historic, I believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of America future generations will inherit,' the letter reads.

It goes on to say that the dangers that loom with the wrong presidency would include 'unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses' and threaten 'many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills'.

The excerpts from the letter show that while the CEO never explicitly said that Obama would be the one to cause said ills, the point is made very clear by the inclusion of a list of Koch-supported candidates. Needless to say, Obama did not make the list.

The letter says that the list comes at the request of 'many employees' who wanted to know what state and local politicians are supported by 'Koch companies or by KOCHPAC, our employee political action committee'.

The full text of the letter- and of 
the supporting list- were not made public by In These Times, but the 
site reports that in addition to Mitt Romney, 14 other Republican state 
politicians were highlighted.

Though the cover letter was signed by 
Mr Robertson, the driving force was explicitly clear: an anti-Obama 
editorial penned by Charles Koch and a pro-Romney editorial by his 
brother David were included in the packets.

While we are typically told before each Presidential election that it is important and historic, I believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of America future generations will inherit.

If we elect candidates who want to spend hundreds of billions in borrowed money on costly new subsidies for a few favored cronies, put unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses, prevent or delay important new construction projects, and excessively hinder free trade, then many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills.

At the request of many employees, we have also provided a list of candidates in your state that have been supported by Koch companies or by KOCHPAC, our employee political action committee.

We believe any decision about which candidates to support is—as always—yours and yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you. Second, we do not support candidates based on their political affiliation.

Exerting such pressure on employees 
was not always legal, but recent Supreme Court decisions no longer 
prohibit companies from telling their employees who to vote for.

For appearances sake, however, the 
letter did include one line gesturing towards partiality: 'We believe 
any decision about which candidates to support is—as always—yours and 
yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you.'

Longtime Koch Industries employees are likely familiar with the move, as workers at the same Georgia Pacific plant received a similar packet two years ago during the midterm elections.

At the time, then-COO Mr Robertson wrote that 'as Koch company employees, we have a lot at stake in the upcoming election'.

The letter was published in its entirety by The Nation and one of the sheets included voter registration deadline information and also a list of all Koch-supported politicians. On the list of 19 candidates, all but four were Republicans.

One current employee who received the packet said that it is just one of the ways that the Koch brothers are exerting undue influence on their workers.

'They are destroying the planet. They are trying to buy the votes. They think they are so high and mighty. They have their principles. They just think their way is the only way and they think everyone else is wrong,' the man told In These Times. He spoke anonymously for fear of being fired.

'If you don't believe in their philosophy, you can find a job somewhere else. I have worked there for 30-plus years. I have no training; I have worked in a factory. What am I going to do?'

This
is the third time in a week where an influential CEO warned his 
employees about the prospect of an Obama win come November.

Gawker published
the letter written by Westgate Resorts owner David Siegel where he 
clearly said that if Romney won the presidential election, they would be
more likely to keep their jobs.

'The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job however, is another 4 years of the same Presidential administration. Of course, as your employer, I can't tell you whom to vote for, and I certainly wouldn't interfere with your right to vote for whomever you choose,' he wrote.

MSNBC's Chris Hayes reported that Arthur Allen, the CEO of Florida-based ASG Software Solutions, sent an email to more than 1,000 employees saying that the company needs a new administration to remain 'independent' in order to keep from cutting costs and firing employees.

'I can tell you, if the US re-elects President Obama, our chances of staying independent are slim to none,' he wrote.

'If we fail as a nation to make the right choice on November 6th, and we lose our independence as a company, I don't want to hear any complaints regarding the fallout that will most likely come.'

When it comes to the Kochs, the brothers prefer to remain behind the curtain rather than in the spotlight.

As a result, no members of the press were invited to their seaside $50,000-per-plate fundraiser for Romney in their Hamptons home this July.

There was a brief break in that privacy lately, however, as their other brother William now faces a lawsuit after he allegedly held a former employee hostage for two days.

Ranked fourth and fifth respectively on Forbes' list of the richest Americans, Charles and David Koch made their money in industrial markets.

Their company- Koch Industries- is the second largest privately held company in the country with 67,000 employees.

Charles, 76, and David, 72, are both worth an estimated $31billion and are jointly ranked as the 45th most powerful people in the world.

Known for their political connections to Republican groups that support lightened regulation and free markets, Charles is thought to donate more than $40million per year to his libertarian foundation.

While many political analysts have understood their power for years, the pair made their biggest foray on the public stage when they helped to found the political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity, which played a significant role in the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the surge of the Tea Party movement.

They have focused their attention to specific political campaigns in the past and had successful results. The clearest of those successes was the gubernatorial campaign of union-busting Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin.

Though the pair are famous for the secretive way in which they do business, their name has become something of a stereotype when it comes to labelling the questionable connections between private enterprise and public works.

'The Koch brothers are the poster children of the effort by multinational corporate America to try to redefine the rights and values of American citizens,' Democratic Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore told The New York Times.

Hollywood took notice of the Koch’s public perception, and a shady pair of billionaire brothers (the ‘Motch brothers’) were made the villains in The Campaign, a comedy starring Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell.

Making the point more clear, Mr Galifianakis was asked about the Kochs during the press tour for the film, and he said: ‘I disagree with everything they do. They are creepy and there is no way around that. It's not freedom what they are doing.’

In turn, the Koch press representative responded by taking a shot at the Hangover star’s career: ‘Last we checked, the movie is a comedy. Maybe more to the point is that it's laughable to take political guidance or moral instruction from a guy who makes obscene gestures with a monkey on a bus in Bangkok.’
