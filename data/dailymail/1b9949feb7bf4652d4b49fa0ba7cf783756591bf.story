It will be a new-look Liverpool that returns to the Champions League to great anticipation this week but such is the reputation of Anfield on European nights, the class of 2014 know expectations will be sky-high among their supporters.

Philippe Coutinho, one of the club’s new generation with the difficult task of following Kevin Keegan, David Fairclough, Kenny Dalglish and Luis Garcia into European folklore, can feel the tingle of excitement ahead of Tuesday night’s game with Bulgarian side Ludogorets, with glamour ties against Real Madrid and Basle to come.

But he warns it is also the job of Brendan Rodgers’ squad to let the fans soak up the emotion, while they deal with the reality of playing in Europe’s premier competition after a five-year absence.

Philippe Coutinho is relishing playing in the Champions League for Liverpool at Anfield

‘I’ve heard all about the experience of playing at Anfield in the Champions League – I can’ t wait for it to happen,’ he says.

‘When we come out with the floodlights turned on, it will be more like appearing at a show or a concert than a football match. The atmosphere at our stadium was fantastic last year when the fans would gather to wait for our team bus to arrive, and this will be different, and maybe even better.

‘I know about Liverpool’s tradition in the competition, so hopes will be high. But considering Liverpool as one of the favourites for the Champions League before we kick a ball is something for the fans, not for the team.

‘I believe that we have a strong squad, new players have been brought in and we are in a good position to perform well in the Champions League, but without calling ourselves favourites or anything like that.’

Coutinho is right to be cautious in his optimism. Only four survivors – Steven Gerrard, Martin Skrtel, Lucas and Glen Johnson - are left at Anfield from their last Champions League campaign in 2009/10 when they were knocked out of the group stage after defeats against Stevan Jovetic’s Fiorentina, and Lyon who had Hugo Lloris in goal.

Of the quartet, only Gerrard is likely to start this week, and he added to the anticipation by attending last week’s premier of a new film “One Night in Istanbul” about the club’s legendary fifth European Cup triumph against AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005.

The number of Champions League debutants in Rodgers’ likely line-up leaves Coutinho, at the age of 22, as one of Liverpool’s more experienced European players. He was just 18 when he played in the Champions League for then-holders Inter Milan, including the two matches against Spurs that made Gareth Bale famous.

His hero growing up in Brazil, Ronaldinho, won the trophy with Barcelona and he remembers feeling sorry at the time for Kaka when his AC Milan team were defeated by Liverpool in Istanbul in the 2005 final.

‘We are confident we can go through to the next round but we know it’ll be difficult. Not just against Real Madrid, but the other two teams as well.

‘It’s Champions League so of course it is going to be tough. But we are looking forward to getting off to a good start with the fans behind us. Then we will look at it game by game and see if we can get through to the next round.

‘Of course, I’m well aware Liverpool have won the trophy a number of times. The players are very motivated and excited to be in the Champions League. It’s not only important for the fans to be back in the Champions League, but also important for the players. ‘We want to get off to a good start next week and have other good matches along the way.

‘The Champions League has become a famous tournament in Brazil, people are watching it as much as Brazilian football. For me, it is certainly an inspiration.’

Coutinho and new Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli crossed paths for a couple of weeks at the San Siro, Coutinho arriving from Brazil just as the striker was getting ready to leave for Manchester City.

But the midfielder, recently drafted into the Brazil squad after being left out of the World Cup by Felipe Scolari, names another team-mate he thinks will take Europe by storm.

‘It is likely Raheem Sterling will be one of our stars,’ he says without hesitation about the new golden boy of English football.

‘He is having a very good time and is in very good shape. I believe he will do quite well in the Champions League, he’s very fast – I know I don’t have the speed to catch him!

‘I’ve not been surprised at all by his performances this season, including for England. We train together every day so I know his potential. I’m confident this will be a good season for him.’

Liverpool’s surprise title challenge last season was mounted without the distraction of midweek European football.

Brendan Rodgers has signed eight players in the summer to try and cope with the dual demands and Coutinho doesn’t think it will harm the club’s results.

‘I think the more big matches we have, the more motivated we will feel,’ he said. ‘I don’t feel it will be a problem to play in both competitions at the same time.’

Coutinho’s quick feet and match intelligence have already made him a natural fit for Liverpool’s famed pass-and-move style.

The last two English clubs to have won the Champions League, Chelsea and Manchester United, both had a Brazilian member of their victorious squad; David Luiz and Anderson. Rodgers and The Kop will hope good things come in threes.
