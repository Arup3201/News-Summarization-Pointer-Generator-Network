For Vanessa James, a mother who thought little of climbing a tree or leap-frogging into the monkey pen during visits to the zoo was nothing out of the ordinary.

And yet, her childhood, unusual though it was, was eclipsed by that of her mother, Bradford housewife Marina Chapman, who was brought up not by a human family but by a troupe of monkeys.

Now Vanessa has spoken out ahead of a new National Geographic documentary that sheds further light on Mrs Chapman's extraordinary story and reveals what happened when she finally returned to the Colombian jungle more than half a century later.

Marina Chapman's incredible tale began at the age of four when she was kidnapped and abandoned in the jungle by the unscrupulous gang that took her.

Terrified and alone, the little girl was discovered by a troupe of Capuchin monkeys who adopted her, teaching her how to feed herself, climb trees and escape from predators.

By the time she was found, five years later, she could no longer communicate with humans and was living a wild Mowgli-style existence.

Taking advantage of her vulnerability. Mrs Chapman was sold to a brothel in the northern city of Cucuta, where she was regularly beaten.

After escaping, Mrs Chapman, who by then was calling herself Marina Luz, met Bradford-based scientist John Chapman and emigrated to the UK where she has lived ever since.

Earlier this year, Mrs Chapman caused a furore when her incredible story came to light following the publication of her autobiography, The Girl With No Name.

Cool mum: Vanessa says she wouldn't change a thing about her mother - including her lingering fondness for climbing trees

But for daughter Vanessa, the revelations came as no surprise whatsoever. 'She didn't really have a moment where she sat down and told us, it just kind of naturally came out,' she explains in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'During dinner parties, people would ask, and information would come out, and we would wait to hear more of her stories. Growing up with her was an amazing experience.'

And Mrs Chapman's monkey memories weren't confined to dinner table conversation. According to Vanessa, her mother still, at times, behaves as if she were still in the jungle.

'We've always known how mum is and it's hard to believe she was raised normally,' she adds. 'She loves climbing trees and having fun and adventures.

'She just has different priorities and she really struggles with lying. It's all very practical so that kind of makes sense with her background.'

And despite the passage of more than half-a-century since her jungle childhood, Vanessa says her mother has never lost her love for the Capuchins who raised her.

'Her passion and excitement for them has never died down,' she explains.'But she has forgotten the language and a lot of the culture.'

Rather wonderfully, Vanessa also tells of her mother's overwhelming excitement when confronted by the chance to see monkeys - even in a zoo.

'We would go to Monkey World, and she wouldn't speak all day,' remembers Vanessa. 'She'd be planning to jump over the fence and her pockets would be full of fruit and feed.'

She would even display monkey-like behaviour with her children, and, according to Vanessa, would spend hours grooming them.

'When we were growing up, it all seemed normal, including family grooming time when she would scratch our backs and pick through our hair,' she reveals.

'She would play with animals all the time, climb trees and you could see that she climbs in a different [monkey style] way.'

Unconventional though her own childhood might have been, Vanessa, who co-authored her mother's autobiography, wouldn't change a second of it.

'It was the best,' she enthuses, adding: 'I wouldn't want to change anything - I definitely had a cool mum!

'Her perspective on life is really different: she never pities and she doesn't judge. She raised us to be really strong and that's a great way to grow up.'

Woman Raised by Monkeys premieres next Thursday, 12th December, at 9pm exclusively on the National Geographic Channel
