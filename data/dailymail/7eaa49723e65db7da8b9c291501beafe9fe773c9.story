The ice bucket challenge is the latest craze to sweep the United States – and now it seems the cold water trend has hit the UK.

It involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads to raise money for charity before nominating other people to get involved.

The trend started in America where people wanted to raise awareness of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – also referred to as motor neurone disease.

It went viral after Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part.

This then spread to celebrities including Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and even Bill Gates.

Now the phenomenon has landed in the UK with people across the country gearing up to the challenge - and supporting the UK's version of the charity - the MND Association.

Zuleika Henderson, 38, from Crystal Palace in London decided to do her ice bucket challenge in front of iconic clock tower, Big Ben.

She said: ‘I was challenged by a friend of mine from the New York police department who also challenged others from Canada, South Africa and Australia so I felt the need to do something special for London.

'It was of course, utterly freezing, and very confusing for some of the tourists there to see Big Ben - I'm sure I'll be in a few of their holiday photos!'

The communications manager added: 'I think a few minutes of icy pain isn't much if it raises awareness and donations for people who face a disease every day. I didn't know what ALS was before the challenge, so it worked in my case, I think the ice bucket challenge is doing a lot of good.' 

Others have been taking part but using the opportunity to donate to different charities.

Macmillan Cancer Support has also received thousands of donations after it asked people to use the hashtag #icebucketchallenge to share their videos on social media.

The youngest challenger so far, six-year-old Ianto, was filmed taking part in the challenge by his father Shaun Gustard, who shared it on Facebook.

He was spared the ice cubes but managed to pour the cold water over his head in support of his mother who is battling cancer and recently had lymph nodes removed.

Mr Gustard told Macmillan Cancer Support: ‘He’s a really sensitive kid and when he went to see her [his mother] after surgery he was very upset – it really knocked him for six.

‘Ianto is naturally very kind and caring, so when he saw me do an ice bucket challenge the day after he’d been to see her, he asked if he could do one too, for his mum. I thought it was a bit mean to put ice in the bucket so we used cold water.

‘Macmillan have been a huge source of support to Jane so we’re really proud of him and hope he’s made a difference.’

Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has also taken part in the ice bucket challenge and pledged his support in aid of the James McCarthy Foundation.

The Manchester United midfielder was only too happy to receive two buckets of ice cold water over his head, dedicating it to James McCarthy, a young man from Manchester who has suffered with illness ever since a car crash in 2009.

He has now challenged former Manchester United duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Wes Brown as the next personnel to take part in the craze.

Both Paul Scholes and Gary Neville had already undertaken the challenge after the Class of 92 match which took place last week. The only well-known figure to decline the challenge so far has been President Obama, who chose to donate $100 to the ALS Association instead.

Comedian Ricky Gervais also uploaded his ice bucket challenge to his Facebook page today. 

The phenomenon has raised nearly $3 million for the ALS Association – which is 50 per cent more than they raised last year.
