Nick Clegg will appear on LBC 97.3 every Thursday morning, in an attempt to find out what people are thinking

Nick Clegg is to host a weekly radio phone-in an extraordinary attempt to win over voters as Lib Dem strategists warn they have a year to turn the party’s poll ratings around.

In an unprecedented move for a party leader, the Deputy Prime Minister is to take calls from listeners every Thursday to find out what ‘people are thinking’.

Named 'Call Clegg' the weekly show is a massive gamble and could see the Lib Dem boss berated for every government gaffe and unpopular policy in the news.

Tory MPs branded the show 'bizarre' and claimed he would spend more time answering questions on the radio than from MPs in the Commons.

It comes as Mr Clegg has been put on notice that he only has until the end of 2013 to rescue dozens of his MPs from wipeout.

The bizarre move to swap the Despatch Box for the DJ's studio also risked over-shadowing the coalition's Mid-Term Review, which is supposed to present a united front with the Conservatives.

Mr Clegg, who celebrates his 46th birthday today, staged a joint press conference with David Cameron yesterday afternoon, setting out a raft of new policies to be implemented before the 2015 election.

But the decision to announce that he will be putting himself at the mercy of radio listeners will be seen as an attempt to distance himself from the coalition.

Mr Clegg, who has seen his party over-taken in the polls by the UK Independence Party, hopes to turn his ratings around by appearing on London's LBC 97.3 radio station every Thursday morning.

Aides say he is 'comfortable with the format' which will see him spend half an hour every week answering calls, texts and emails.

It means he will spend two hours-a-month responding to questions on the radio, three times the 40 minutes he spends dealing with oral questions at the Despatch Box as Deputy Prime Minister.

Call Clegg will be hosted by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari, who hols regular phone-ins with London Mayor Boris Johnson

Tory MP Ian Liddel-Grainger said: 
'Having sat and listened to him at Deputy PM's Questions, he has never 
answered a question yet so he isn't likely to break the habit of a 
lifetime on the radio.

'Why
doesn't he just get on with the job? He is completely invisible anyway,
so it's a good job it's on the radio not the television because viewers
wouldn't be able to see him.'

Tory MP Peter Bone said the idea of the Call Clegg show was ‘bizarre’.

‘The public will get more chance to 
question him than MPs. I would have thought he should be spending his 
time as Deputy Prime Minister supporting the Prime Minister in his 
activities.

‘I am quite amazed that he has got enough time to go off and do a radio programme every Thursday.’

Nick Clegg is not the first politician to use TV and radio shows to broaden his appeal, but not all have been successful.

Tory MP Nadine Dorries entered the I’m A Celebrity jungle in November, claiming she was going where the voters are and would highlight important policies like lowering the abortion limit. Instead she was seen eating camel toe and was the first star to be kicked off the show in a public vote.

Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor who joined the coalition Cabinet, hosted nine series of his Radio 4 series Jazz Greats.

Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, scored an impressive 36-40 when he appeared on the Christmas special of Strictly Come Dancing in 2010.

Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders moonlights as a rock DJ on community station Riviera FM in his Torbay constituency. But he risked controversy when he claimed rock giants Muse were not the best bad to emerge from the Bay, preferring instead 70s act Wishbone Ash.

Transport minister Norman Baker hosts Anything Goes on Seahaven FM,  promising ‘an eclectic mix of jazz, blues, swing, country and a lot more besides, from the 1920s to the present day, with the emphasis on the laid back’. The Lib Dem admits his records ‘are a little bit offbeat’.

Respect MP George Galloway did little to improve the reputation of politicians when he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2006, donning a red cat suit to purr and lick milk from the hand of actress Rula Lenska. He later hosted a show on TalkSport for six years until 2012.

Mr Clegg will be co-hosting with LBC 
presenter Nick Ferrari, following in the footsteps of London Mayor Boris
Johnson who also takes part in regular phone-ins on the station.

‘I'm doing this because I don't think politicians get to hear enough from people directly,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘You can't do the right thing in government unless you keep in touch with how people are thinking and feeling.

'Nick
Ferrari is known as the interviewer that all politicians fear. He can 
be very tough but he's generally fair, very well informed and I hope 
we’ll make a good combination for the show we're doing together.'

But Labour MP John Mann said: 'It 
shows how irrelevant he is to the running of the country. My question to
ask Nick is: What's the point of Nick Clegg? Is he Kilroy in disguise?'

In a Mail on Sunday opinion poll 
yesterday the Lib Dems were on 11 per cent, well behind UKIP which has 
surged to 16 per cent on the back of rising dissatisfaction with the 
government’s stance on Europe.

Lib Dems have repeatedly stressed that the five-year parliament gives them chance to reverse their woeful ratings.

However, senior party figures now admit that without a major change in fortunes in the next 12 months, Mr Clegg could be in trouble.

‘We have kept saying we have got 
plenty of time but we’ve really got to see things turning around this 
year,’ a senior Lib Dem source told MailOnline.

‘If we get to the end of 2013 and the polls are still bad for Nick, we will be in trouble.’

Lib Dem insiders say they hope the clips of Mr Clegg's show will be used across the Global Radio network, which owns LBC as well as stations like Heart and Classic FM.

Mr Clegg's latest attempt to reach out to voters comes after his YouTube video apology for promising to vote against tuition fees was remixed, ridiculed and released as a single, reaching 143 in the charts.

By putting himself at the mercy of angry voters every week, Mr Clegg's attempt to connect with voters could backfire.

'It won't be faultless every week,' an advisor said. 'That's the risk of doing live radio.'

Richard Park, Global Radio’s director of broadcasting,  said: 'Once again, LBC 97.3 delivers a first, as we welcome the Deputy Prime Minister to London’s biggest conversation.

'No other station offers its listeners such unique access to a senior member of Government. This will be must-listen radio.'

The show, for which Mr Clegg is not being paid, starts this Thursday from 9am.

The decision may go down badly with Mr Clegg’s constituents in Sheffield Hallam, where he has been MP since 2005. Local Liberal Democrats blamed him for losing control of the city council to Labour last year.

Paul Blomfield, Labour MP for Sheffield Central said: ‘That is extraordinary. I think that his constituents in Sheffield are right to ask why he’s chosen to engage in a conversation with London voters, on a regional programme every week, instead of the people of the city he purports to represent.

'Is he too unnerved by what he knows he would hear from Sheffield voters?

‘Also I would have thought that at a time when working families are facing rising costs, and tightening budgets, he ought to be concentrating on his day job of running the country instead of doing a talk show with London radio listeners.’

David Laws, Lib Dem education minister and a key ally of Mr Clegg, insisted that despite wofeul poll ratings and local election results, the party's remaining supporters are 'realistic' about the need for difficult decisions.

'Lib Dems, like everybody else, can count. They can count that when we came to power we had a deficit of £160 thousand million pounds,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'Our supporters are realistic about this. They know there are tough times. They do not believe that every decision made by the Government in these circumstances can be an easy and popular one.

'We are still united as a party in believing that we need to be in coalition to deliver for the country, put our policies into practice, and also because the electorate in May 2010 did not give a majority to any one party.'

Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg today sought to prevent the break-up of the coalition for another two and a half years, unveiling a raft of new ideas to last them until 2015.

Making a rare joint appearance in Downing Street, the Tory and Lib Dem leaders dismissed calls from their backbenchers for an early 'divorce' to insist their commitment to the power-sharing deal was 'unwavering'.

Launching the 52-page Mid-Term Review, the two men hailed their progress in tackling the vast debts inherited from the Labour party and pledged action on cutting childcare costs, increasing the state pension and investing in new roads, rail links and affordable homes.
