A 13-year-old girl has accepted a basketball scholarship at the University of Texas for the year 2020.

Deja Kelly started dribbling at the age of three.

By kindergarten she was playing fifth-graders, and when she reached fifth grade she was getting college offers.

Now, before she's even entered high school, the Luna Middle School pupil from San Antonio, Texas, has made a verbal agreement with the school - something many 19-year-olds could only dream of.

Superstar: Deja Kelly, 13, has accepted an offer from the University of Texas to play college basketball

Excited: She said she has always wanted to go to Texas, where her father played two seasons 1999-2001

'This has just always been my dream, I just love it,' she told NBC's Today. 

Dozens of campuses have expressed interest in recruiting Deja, but she claims she has always dreamed of going to Texas, where her father Darren Kelly played for two seasons from 1999 to 2001. 

Her father insists he would have wanted her to wait to make the crucial decision.

But nothing would change Deja's mind. 

Talented: Deja has been playing basketball since she was three years old and received offers from all over

Power: Basketball is Deja's life and she said she can't imagine backing down from the offer in years to come

Her mother and coach Theresa Nunn told ESPN: 'We are confident about the decision.

'I definitely think she made the right choice.'

She has trained Deja since the age of three and they work together on the South Texas HOYAS team (Helping Our Youth Attain Scholarships).

'If basketball were taken away tomorrow,' Nunn said, 'she'd still be in love with the school.'

Coach: Her mother Theresa Nunn played college basketball and has been Deja's coach for 10 years

Too soon? Her father Darren Kelly, who played for Texas, said he had hoped Deja would wait a bit to decide

'I know kids change their minds on a daily basis,' Nunn said. 'But this is something she's been pretty concrete with for the past five or six years.' 

Although the contract cannot be written or binding, Deja says she cannot imagine backing down. 

She is not the first player to court interest years ahead of time.

The University of Miami recruited nine-year-old Jaden Newman of Orlando, Florida, in June.
