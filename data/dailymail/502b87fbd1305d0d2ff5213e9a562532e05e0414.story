Iowa City resident Sean Boies faces an unauthorized computer access charge, as well as two identity theft charges, KCRG reported.

Bogus mentioned his bogus occupation in an online survey he put up on January 9, police said in charging documents obtained by the affiliate station..

Women were allegedly asked to submit racy underwear photographs, police reportedly stated in the documents. 

The survey offered winners a Miami photo shoot that would be private, the documents reportedly said.

Boies confessed two individuals sent in photographs, authorities said in a criminal complaint cited by KCRG.

He also reportedly confessed to using the survey as a way to get women's photographs, the affiliate station reported.

A March survey - in which Boies claimed again to work for the lingerie giant - offered a gift card worth $25 to those who filled it out with personal information, KCRG reported.

Citing the complaint, the news outlet said that Boies confessed to not mailing out the gift cards.

He also stated the surveys were used as a way to get personal data from respondents, according to The Iowa City Press-Citizen.

Boies stole two University of Iowa students' login credentials to build his surveys with a software called Qualtrics, University of Iowa police told KCRG. 

From December of last year to May 31, 2014, over 6,200 people answered Boies' surveys, university police said. 

Police booked Boies Thursday and he was later released from the Johnson County Jail that morning, The Iowa City Press-Citizen reported.
