A powerful new ad series shows mothers nursing their babies in bathroom stalls, in a bid to change negative attitudes towards breastfeeding in public.

The posters - which ask 'would you eat here?' - were created by University of North Texas design students Kris Haro and Johnathan Wenske as part of a college project.

The duo state on their website, When Nurture Calls, that they wanted to show 'mothers who have been harassed to the point where they feel they have no other option but to nurture their baby in the restroom as to not offend anyone.'

The posters are captioned: 'bon appetit', 'table for two' and 'private dining', presenting a strong contrast with the distressed looks on the women’s faces.

Small print at the bottom of each ad reads: 'Would you eat here?’

It continues: 'By law, breastfeeding mothers are not protected from harassment and refusal of service in public, often forcing them to feed in secluded spaces such as public bathrooms.

'Contact your state and/or local representative to voice your support for breastfeeding mothers, because a baby should never be nurtured where nature calls.'

Miss Haro and Mr Wenske encourage people on their website to support the HB 1706 bill, which legally protects women from harassment when they breastfeed in public places such as movie theaters or restaurants.

It was originally introduced in 2013 by Texas House Representative, Jessica Farrar, but has since been dismissed

'I breastfeed my beautiful 
daughter wherever I am, however I always feel on edge that 
someone is going to have a go'

Ms Farrar states that the lifelong benefits of breastfeeding include improved cognitive development and reduced risk factors for childhood obesity, asthma, celiac disease, post-neonatal death, and certain cancers.

The HB 1706 bill is now expected to be reintroduced in January 2015, and Miss Haro and Mr Wenske say the purpose of their campaign is to keep support and momentum going.

Since launching their initiative on Monday their Facebook page, When Nurture Calls, has attracted more than 1,000 ‘likes’.

Many women have praised them for highlighting an 'undiscussed' issue.

Spreading the word: The adverts were created in a bid to break the taboo of breastfeeding in public and many mothers have praised the initiative

One fan wrote: 'I am breastfeeding my beautiful daughter and I do this wherever I am, however I always feel on edge that someone is going to have a go. It would not stop me doing it as I refuse to feed my child in a toilet. Thank you for doing this. Breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world.'

Another added: 'I am so glad you are bringing attention to this. In addition to breastfeeding in bathrooms and cars, I (as a teacher) had to pump in the co-ed faculty high school bathroom between classes.'

Miss Haro and Mr Wenske have also designed an app as part of their Breast Friends project, which will allow mothers to search for places that support breastfeeding and have a friendly attitude towards it.

Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have laws that specifically give women the right to nurse in public.

However, in many cases, the legislation would not allow a mother to take legal action against a person who harasses or discriminates against her.
