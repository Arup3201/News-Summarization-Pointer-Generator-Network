Arsene Wenger is no stranger to touchline bust-ups.

Be it brow to brow, fist to fist or boot to bottle, the fiery Frenchman isn’t afraid to treat his technical zone as a boxing ring.

His latest flashpoint came at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when he took on Jose Mourinho.

Here, Sportsmail look back at five bouts involving the Arsenal boss…

Wenger vs Mourinho, 2014

Gary Cahill’s reckless lunge on Alexis Sanchez riled Wenger and he made straight for Mourinho.

Catching the Portuguese off guard, Wenger planted his palms in Mourinho’s chest, knocking him off balance.

The Chelsea boss tried to retaliate but Wenger’s reach was too much and again the Arsenal chief landed a shove before the fourth official saved Mourinho further embarrassment.

VERDICT: This was as good as a technical knockout for angry Arsene who emerged as the clear victor…

Wenger vs Kenny Dalglish, 2011

The game was 11 minutes in to injury-time when Dirk Kuyt rescued a 1-1 draw for Liverpool from the penalty spot.

Wenger wasn’t happy with the award of the spot-kick, nor the time added on, and approached Dalglish.

But the Scot wasn’t in the mood to entertain Wenger’s moan, telling him to ‘p*** off’, which he duly did.

VERDICT: Dalglish’s sharp tongue gets him a TKO over Wenger, whose protest was a little lame.

Wenger vs plastic bottle, 2009

After celebrating Robin van Persie’s goal at Manchester United - only to see it disallowed for a marginal offside - Wenger took his frustration out on a plastic bottle, booting it in the air.

The fourth official took exception to his thuggery and quickly informed referee Mike Dean of his attack on the unsuspecting water bottle.

Dean, equally enraged, sent Wenger to the stands where he took his position on a platform behind the dugout, much to the amusement of United’s supporters.

VERDICT: Knockout – the water bottle did not stand a chance…

Wenger vs Mourinho, 2007

For once, Wenger played peacemaker when a mass brawl broke out during the 2007 Carling Cup final.

Three players – Arsenal’s Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Adebayor and Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel – were sent off, but Wenger remained unflappable.

He and Mourinho quickly entered the pitch as tempers – and fists – flared, but the Arsenal boss kept his own emotions in check and pulled his opposite number away from his own players.

VERDICT: A rematch was needed to settle this score…

Wenger vs Alan Pardew, 2006

When West Ham boss Pardew celebrated Marlon Harewood’s late winner at Upton Park, Wenger wasn’t impressed.

A Pardew fist pump – in Wenger’s direction – was the source of his ire. Pardew protested against Wenger’s displeasure but was met with a hefty shove.

But the Frenchman wasn’t finished there and, when he again went for his opposite number, the intervening fourth official felt Wenger’s wrath.

Pardew attempted to explain his actions but his adversary wasn’t having any of it and refused to shake hands on full-time.

Wenger was subsequently fined by the FA while Pardew was cleared of all charges.

VERDICT: Wenger wins on points but pays the price for his brutality…

Wenger vs Martin Jol, 2006

Spurs boss Jol instructed his players to carry on while two Arsenal men lay injured on the turf, and it resulted in a Robbie Keane goal.

An irate Wenger went brow to brow with the burly Dutchman before the fourth official stepped in. Wenger’s chest was puffed and his fists clenched, but this time he kept his hands down.

VERDICT: King of cool Jol takes the contest on points…
