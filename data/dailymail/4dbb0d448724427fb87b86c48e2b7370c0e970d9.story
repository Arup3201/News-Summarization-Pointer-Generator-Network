Labour leader Ed Miliband toasted the end of his party conference with a trip to Coronation Street's infamous pub the Rovers Return.

Mr Miliband visited the street's local to mark the end of Labour's five-day gathering in Manchester, as he joked with cast members Michelle Collins, Michelle Keegan and Catherine Tyldesley.

He used his visit to ask cast members for their tips on learning lines after delivering a 7,500-word speech to conference without notes on Tuesday.

After delivering one of the most audacious Labour speeches in recent times, Mr Miliband wasted no time in asking the actresses how they went about memorising their script lines, stating that he had written out around 6,000 words of his own ‘One Nation’ speech in advance.

Mr Miliband spoke to actresses Michelle Collins and Michelle Keegan, who play barmaids Stella and Tina, as well as Catherine Tyldesley, who plays Eva, in the iconic pub.

He then headed out on to the cobbles 
where he met Street stalwarts Eileen Derbyshire, who plays Emily Bishop
in the soap, and Malcom Hebden, who plays Norris Cole, as they filmed 
scenes.

Mr Miliband asked them about memorising lines and told them: 'I don’t know how you do it five days a week.'

Inside the Rovers set, actress Michelle Collins told him that actors had been known to scrawl notes on bar mats whilst filming their scenes.

Mr Miliband said he had written out around 6,000 words of his own ‘One Nation’ speech in advance, but ended up delivering 7,500 during the hour-long talk which has been widely seen as a success.

He said: 'The difference for me was it was less, for me, about learning the lines and more about saying what I believe in.'

Miliband has been applauded from several quarters this week after his Labour party conference performance exceeded expectations.
