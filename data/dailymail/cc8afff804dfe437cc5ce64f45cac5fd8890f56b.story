It all began in 1994 with Eva Herzigova's famous
‘Hello Boys’ advertising campaign.

But Wonderbra has come a long way since the Nineties - and technology has advanced just as dramatically.

To mark its success in this multimedia world, the luxury lingerie brand today launches its first app.

Called the Wonderbra Decoder App, the downloadable app allows users to undress stunning 21-year-old model Adriana Cernanova - the latest face of the brand - to reveal her racy underwear.

Now you see it... now you don't! The new app allows users to 'undress' Adriana

The 21-year-old Danish model looks stunning in the new ad campaign, which allows you to reveal her underwear secrets

Users who have downloaded the app simply find the images in magazines or online, then hold their smartphone with the app open over the code found on the image.

The model's clothes will instantly disappear - leaving her in the underwear (and, cleverly, details on where to buy it).

The Wonderbra Decoder app is part of the brand's new marketing campaign that hopes to provide users with a more interactive experience.

App users can scan multiple dressed images of 
Adriana to reveal the different Wonderbra behind her look and view a 
gallery of recommended Wonderbras for different outfits, from daywear to
 special occasions.

Although the ad campaign itself is clothed, scanning the image allows you to reveal much more

The campaign will run throughout October and November and is timed for the run up to the Christmas party season.

Martina Alexander, Marketing Manager for Wonderbra UK said: 'Wonderbra offers a bra for all occasions and we want to highlight this in a fun and original way.

'Our new App for fashion-conscious girls, reveals the recommended Wonderbra for different looks to help her enhance any outfit.'

The Wonderbra Decoder App is available now free from the App Store and Google Play and after downloading you can undress Adriana yourself by holding your phone to the screen.

Most girls would feel a little 
apprehensive about following the likes of Herzigova and Dita Von Teese 
into the world of Wonderbra modelling. But Adriana isn't like most girls.

Since she joined the brand in 2011, it is clear to see that the stunning Slovakian is understandably big on confidence and has taken to her new role as Wonderbra Woman with style.

It is easy to see why the 
5ft 11in model was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls following a worldwide 
casting.

Adriana's perfect body is complemented by a big smile, twinkling blue eyes and long blonde hair.

'It is important to always have nice 
underwear and Wonderbra is special in that way because it makes you feel
even sexier,' she said when she joined the label.

A spokeswoman said: 'She is fun, naturally sexy and smart — and exudes a confidence that really sets her apart.'
