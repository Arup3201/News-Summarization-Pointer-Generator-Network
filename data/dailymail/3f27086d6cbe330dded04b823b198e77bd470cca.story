This is the moment a 160lb bear tumbled out of a tree - after being shot with a tranquilizer gun.

The woozy cub lost consciousness and tumbled 12ft off a branch onto a net below as a crowd of onlookers stood by.

The animal had been roaming through suburban gardens terrifying residents but took refuge up the tree. Wildlife officers in Montclair, New Jersey drugged it and stood by until it was unable to cling on any longer and passed out.

The Montclair Patch reported that police were alerted early on Monday as the bear made its way through gardens knocking down bird feeders and eating the food.

It is thought to have wandered into the town because it was hungry.

Watchung Avenue resident Sue Juliano said the bear was in her backyard at about 6:50 a.m. Tuesday.

She told the Montclair Patch that the bear knocked down her bird feeder and ate all their bird food.

After that, the cub wandered over to the nearby Wachtung Park, where it climbed a tree and police kept it cornered until 10 a.m. using hammers to make noises to stop it from running away.

At that point officers from New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife arrived and shot it with a tranquilizer. He was tagged and tattooed and was to be released in a state reservation, Montclair Det. Lt. Angel Roman said.

A large crowd formed to watch with some putting off going to work so they could see the bear fall, and video the event on their iPhones and iPads.

Resident Nancy Arny Pi-Sunyer jokingly compared the incident to Buzz Aldrin's visit two days earlier to Montclair, his hometown.

She said: 'I admire both Buzz and bears. They are both very brave and they have both gone up very high.'

Roman said the male bear was around 18 months old and weighed some 158lbs. He said the bear was first seen on Monday just after midday.

'Police received several calls 
throughout the rest of the day and into the early morning hours as 
residents spotted the bear at times,' he said in a release.

He said: 'It's probably just scurrying around for food.'

Montclair public elementary and middle schools shutdown all outside play and activities on Tuesday after the bear sighting, according to a notice sent to parents from the district superintendent.

Roman said he has been working in Montclair for 20 years and has not heard of a bear sighting before.

The bear is not the first to be tranquilized and fall out of a tree after finding its way into a residential area.

In April, last year a 200lbs bear was drugged after being seen near a residence hall at the University of Colorado in Boulder.

An astonishing photo showed him side on in mid-air as his limp body flew towards a net below.
