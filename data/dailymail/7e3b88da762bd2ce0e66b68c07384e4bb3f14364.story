Steve Bruce is ready to terminate Hatem Ben Arfa’s loan spell at Hull City after dragging him off just 35 minutes into their 3-0 defeat at Manchester United.

Bruce is furious with Ben Arfa for his attitude during the clash - the Hull manager’s 700th game in management - at his former club.

It is understood that another issue arose at half-time between Bruce and Ben Arfa when the players made their way into the dressing room.

Bruce could not be contacted on Friday night and Hull categorically denied that there is any problems between the manager and player.

Ben Arfa, who had already been substituted in the 35th minute when they were a goal down, enraged Bruce with his performance at Old Trafford.

The Hull chief believes it was disrespectful to his team-mates and wants to cut short his loan spell at the KC Stadium.

Bruce immediately axed him from the clash with Everton in midweek and is unlikely to feature in their Barclays Premier League fixture against West Brom on Saturday.

Hull signed the troubled winger from Newcastle on transfer deadline day until the end of the season, but the Tigers intend to cut it short and send him back to St James’ Park.

Hull were a goal down when Bruce made the switch at Old Trafford by bringing on Sone Aluko to take Ben Arfa’s place in the Hull team.

Emotions were already running high at Old Trafford because it was Bruce’s 700th game in charge as a manager on the return to the club where he lifted the Premier League three times in the Nineties.

Ben Arfa has had a chequered career in English football and was banished to the reserve team at Newcastle under manager Alan Pardew.

Hull gave him a lifeline at the start of the season by taking the France winger on loan and he appeared to be rediscovering his form in a flourishing early spell.

But his attitude has come under scrutiny in recent weeks and he appears to have played his last game for the club after the remarkable events at Old Trafford.

On Friday night, Hull claimed the player trained as normal with the first team this morning and insist he is a model professional.
