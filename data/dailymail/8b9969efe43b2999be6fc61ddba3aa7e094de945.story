A campaign designed to encourage Ukrainian tourists to travel in Asia has backfired after being branded 'utterly offensive and 'racist.'

The colourful words on the advert for a Kiev travel agency read: 'See Asia like Asians do', with the accompanying tag line telling viewers 'to read the text screw up your eyes.'

It is accompanied by a collage of photos showing people using their index fingers to slant their eyes while reading the poster.Â 

The angry reaction the advert has sparked echoes the controversy caused in 2008 when the Spanish Olympic basketball team incensed Asian rights groups by posing for a photo pushing up the outside corners of their eyes.

Controversial: The advert suggests that to read the colourful text viewers must 'screw up their eyes'

The advert was created by Ukrainian ad agency Tabasco for travel agency Multipass.

Since the advert appeared online thousands of people have taken to social networking sites and websites to express their opinion the promotion.

On website adsoftheworld a user under the name of MSS wrote: 'What there NOBODY there who said, "This might not be a good idea?" How. Utterly. Offensive.'

Another user called Kikin stated: 'Racist and stupid...you can read the message even without doing that.'

One blog by 'Angry Asian Man read: 'It's unbelievable that it never crossed anyone's mind that this might be kind of, you know, racist.

Viral content website Buzzfeed said in an article: 
'Making slanty eyes for a spontaneous Olympics photo is one thing, but 
this is a poster that took weeks to get from idea to placement.'

'Not sure how well it will work, but it definitely won't help Ukrainian tourism via Asia.'

But some people defended the advert which has divided opinion.

Ava Spears wrote on the advertising website: 'I think the intention was not to be racist, even it may seem, but I think the intention was to be fun.'

While Brady J stated: 'It's just a joke - they obviously didn't set out to offend people.'

Reaction: The outrage the advert has caused echoes the controversy caused in 2008, when the Spanish Olympic basketball team angered Asian rights groups by posing for a photo pushing up the outside corners of their eyes

Disturbing: A group that represents Asians in the United States described the photo as 'disturbing' and 'divisive'

On their presentation the advert 
agency said its brief was 'to promote travel agency, especially its 
Asian destinations, including exclusive ethnic tours.'

It said their idea was to 'Make people experience Asian like Asians do.'

And their controversial solution was:
'We created outdoor campaign with titles which can be read only if you 
screw your eyes in order to see the world literally as Asians do.'

Four years ago the Spanish 
basketball team landed in trouble over an advertisement showing the 
players from both the men's and the women's team using their fingers to 
make their eyes look more Chinese.

The pictures, which has been running 
as a newspaper spread in Spain since Friday, shows both sets of players 
making the gesture on a basketball court adorned with a Chinese dragon.

They were part of a publicity campaign for team sponsor Seur and was only used in Spain.

It is not the first time that an advertising campaign has been branded racist.

Although there are several in the past which have been dubious, even this year PopChips pulled an Ashton Kutcher advert after an internet outcry.

The actor's brown face and singsong Indian accent lead to it being deemed racist.
