The desperate hunt for a two-year-old autistic boy who has now been missing for 24 hours was continuing today after police failed to find him overnight. 

Sam Trott, from Landsdale, in Perth, wandered out of the front door which had been left open by workmen and has not been seen since.  

His disappearance sparked a major land search and rescue operation in the suburb on Tuesday for the missing boy who has autism and was last seen in the vicinity of Walbrook Mews just after 10.30am.

Police said that the search would continue overnight and made a plea for more help from the public to help find the boy.

'Because of the time and evening getting dark, little Sam will be looking for somewhere to sleep,' a police spokesman said.

'We're asking for everyone in the Landsdale area, and nearby, to thoroughly search everywhere in their backyards, inside vehicles, under vehicles and anywhere a small boy might seek shelter.'

The police also praised the local community for the help they have received already saying: 'Support from the public has been overwhelming.' 

A Facebook page has been set up to get more people involved in the search, and it already has 1,551 shares on it. A police hotline has been set up too for anyone to call if they have any information. The phone number is: 131444.

Perth Now reported that Sam’s parents Lyndal and Matt Trott made a statement to the media on Tuesday afternoon when their son vanished after wandering off from their northern suburbs home.  

Police are searching on foot and on horseback, assisted by police dogs, police divers, the air wing unit, local rangers, State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers and neighbours. Twenty-seven police officers have been involved in the search, and it’s expected to continue through the night with another 20 officers on their way to help.

The Trotts said Sam went missing out of their front door as workmen went in and out of their home on Tuesday morning. The workmen had come to install some mirrors. One minute two-and-a-half-year-old Sam was there; the next he wasn't. 

'I heard the fridge door beep because he was in the fridge, I said ‘shut the door Sam’. Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn’t there,' Mrs Trott told Perth Now.

'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore.

'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn’t see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name.

'He doesn’t know how to open doors but the door was wide open.'

Mr Trott pleaded for everyone living in the area to check their backyards, frontyards… everywhere.

The search for Sam will continue overnight as the police ask the public to help in the search

‘He can be quite sociable but by the same token he could run away. If you see him and he runs away run after him, catch him please because we really need him to come home,’ Sam’s distraught father told Perth News. 

Police and SES volunteers are continuing to door-knock nearby homes and search backyards, while residents are also searching for the toddler on foot and in their cars.
