Elton John has spoken out against Russia's ban on homosexual propaganda by dismissing Vladimir Putin's claims he is welcoming to gays and saying the law had legitimised homophobia.

The pop star's stinging attack come days after the Russian President claimed he had gay friends and praised the 'personal achievements' of homosexual celebrities like John whom he called 'extraordinary'.

In a 500-word statement, John said: 
'What I heard reinforced all the media stories that have been circling 
since the propaganda bill became federal law: that vicious homophobia 
has been legitimised by this legislation and given extremists the cover 
to abuse people's basic human rights.

'Everyone
 shared stories of verbal and physical abuse - at work, in bars and 
restaurants or in the street - since the legislation came into force 
last June.'

The law has come under fire from human rights activists as Russia prepares to host the Winter Olympics next month.

During
 a visit to Moscow in December, John performed a concert at which he 
condemned the law, and said he was keen to gain a first-hand 
understanding of its effect on the LGBT community.

He added that he would welcome the chance to introduce Putin to gay Russians.

Russia's
 law bans the dissemination of 'gay propaganda' among minors, and has 
become a focal point of criticism by the West and human rights activists
 who say the law is discriminatory and represents a crackdown on rights 
and freedoms under Putin.

Russian
 Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev defended the law in an interview with 
CNN and said the Western criticism 'has nothing in common with the real 
situation in our country and wih the rights of representatives of sexual
 minorities.'

According to a
 transcript published on his government's website, Medvedev said Russian
 gays are not complaining about the law or its effects on the way they 
are treated.

'Speaking 
honestly, I have not seen a single appeal, even on the Internet, from 
representives of sexual minorities in which they say that their rights 
are being infringed upon,' he said.

Putin
 has addressed the controversy around the law with journalists several 
times in the past weeks ahead of next month's Winter Olympic Games in 
the Black Sea resort of Sochi, a showcase that Russia hopes will burnish
 its image abroad.

He invoked John as proof that Russians do not discriminate against gays.

'Millions
 of our people sincerely love him despite his orientation,' Putin told 
foreign journalists on Sunday. Putin also said that he had gay 
acquaintances and told the BBC that he would 'definitely' talk with gay 
celebrities like John and actor Ian McKellen.

The
 'Tiny Dancer' singer became a target of the law's supporters last 
September when a parents' group asked Putin to cancel John's December 
concerts in Moscow and Kazan. John first performed in the former Soviet 
Union in 1979.

John, one of 
the world's most prominent gay celebrities who has two children with his
 partner, said the law has also promoted misunderstanding and ignorance 
among the Russian people, and implies that gays are dangerous to 
children.

'In particular, it
 is very disappointing that the law explicitly links homosexuality with 
child sex abuse, which countless studies have shown to be conclusively 
wrong,' said John who has campaigned for gay rights.
