A brewery in a castle is offering punters the chance to bathe in warm beer in their underground vaults.

At Schloss Starkenberger in Austria, seven 13-foot long pools are open for visitors to immerse themselves in warm beer.

Deep in the 700-year-old castle's cellar, artist Wernfried Poschusta modified the old fermentation rooms to hold 84,000 litres in the spa-like baths.

These Austrian beer bath allows visitors the chance to bathe in the underground vaults near where an old brewery used to exist

The bathing area also features a few loungers to dry on after your soak in the warm beer

The brewery has made it clear that while you can order one of the brewery's ten specialty beers from the bar to enjoy while you relax, you cant drink from the pools.

One of the baths contains around 42,000 pints where visitors can sit and bathe and relax fully immersed in beer.

The beer is rich in vitamins and 
calcium, and the brewery says that sitting in it is good for the skin 
and helps cure open wounds and psoriasis.

The giant metal baths are actually old fermenting tanks, re purposed to be safe to bathe in for big beer fans

The brewery is based in a castle in the Austrian country side, amid acres of forest - the perfect place for a serene dip

The old castle brewery combines the brewery portion of the building with some the more historic parts, such as the murals and old oak beams

The pools are big enough for many 
people to sit and bathe in, or more of a massive bath for one person, 
and the beer is brewed on site, at the Schloss Starkenberger brewery, 
with the baths are located in the vaults

The pools started back in 2005 when the old fermentation cellar of the 700-year-old castle became obsolete, so they turned the area into a beer spa.

The beer is kept quite hot, although you can order a cold beer from the pool.

The castle brewery is based on Stark mountain, where there is also a whiskey distillery.

The surroundings around the mountain also feature a lake, which is popular with tourists and locals for its swimming and ice skating. 

Not just for bathing: The brewery also sells its product across the country, and produces ten specialty beers for sale in the bar above the baths

While the beer in the baths is warm, to allow for a more comforting bathing experience, the beer is traditionally served cold

The castle was modified by an artist to make the old fermenting tanks into baths, which are located in the old vaults (pictured)
