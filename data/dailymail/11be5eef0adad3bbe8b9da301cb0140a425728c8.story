It was the policy announcement that really ruffled feathers among Labour’s 47,000 Twitter followers.

After a prankster managed to hack into the party press team’s Twitter account yesterday, it seemed that Ed Miliband had come up with his most revolutionary policy so far.

‘Everybody should have his own owl,’ said the tweet that quickly took flight on social media.

Shad-owl Cabinet: Ed Miliband in a mock picture on Twitter yesterday

Owl;s your sandwhich: A Twitter used the now renowned photo of the Labour leader eating a bacon sandwhich last month

The Labour Press Team was left bemused after its Twitter accounts accidentally sent a message declaring that 'everybody should have his own owl' 

The offer was quickly dubbed Ed Miliband's 'Harry Potter Policy', with many Westminster insiders joking that it was his most popular idea yet

Former deputy leader John Prescott was quick to reply. ‘I’ve always been Owl Labour,’  he declared.

The
 political blogger GuidoFawkes tweeted: ‘For more  information about the
 Labour owl policy, contact their press office on 28 28 20.’

One
 tweeter said: ‘We had  hoped our compulsory owl  guarantee would be a 
head  turning policy, but sadly it’s no longer going to take flight. 
#tweettwoo’. Another, Lucy Vine, said: ‘You know... I think a free owl 
would actually genuinely make me vote Labour.’

Other
 internet posters put up mock images of Mr Miliband with  owls, 
including one that was  pasted on to the picture of him struggling with a
 bacon sandwich last month.

More
 serious-minded observers pointed out that it would be a  policy 
unlikely to find support at the Treasury, as baby barn owls cost around 
£80 each.

To provide one 
for all 63million people in the country would  cost a barnstorming 
£5billion a year, or around 5 per cent of the entire budget for the NHS.

What a wise owl would think of Labour’s chances of winning the General Election next year is another matter.

The party deleted the message but not before it sparked an internet craze. Labour's press Twitter account sent a message later trying to make light of the gaffe

Gordon Brown's manifesto in 2010 pledged a 'future fair for all'. Internet spoofs quickly emerged today claiming Ed Miliband would go into the 2015 general election promising a 'future owl for all'

Owls, like these at the Surrey Bird Rescue Sanctuary, can cost hundreds of pounds each on bird trader websites

Florence Nightingale famously had a pet owl named Athena  which died in 1854. The nurse and her pet are seen here in a drawing by her sister Parthenope, later to become Lady Verney
