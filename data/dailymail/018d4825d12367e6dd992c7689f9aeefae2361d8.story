She is the TOWIE star turned designer whose clothing collection was met with sneers by many in the fashion world when it launched last year.

But
as she releases her sixth collection, it looks like Amy Childs is having the last laugh.

With sales still 
going strong, it seems the flame-haired Essex girl has managed to make a success of her 
foray into fashion.

High summer: Amy Childs has unveiled her sixth clothing collection, a summer selection of bright floral prints

Her latest summer range offers the sort of bright, summery and affordable maxis and lace dresses the 22-year-old has made her signature look.

Amy has created a collection that she hopes will be perfect for women heading off on their summer holidays, be it for a week of partying or a chic weekend city break - she says there is a dress for every occasion.

Hoping to defy her critics with the summer collection, which she models herself, the star revealed: 'I work really hard on all of my designs 
and I want to be taken seriously as a fashion designer.

'It took us six 
months to do my Spring/Summer Collection. I have just been out to the 
Far East to look at fabrics with my designers and we are now putting the
finishing touches to the Autumn/Winter Collection which I am really 
excited about.

'I get so excited seeing people out in my 
collection – I have just been out in Marbella and I saw quite a few Amy 
Childs’ Collection pieces.

'I am always thinking about my collection 
and how I can make it different. I take inspiration and ideas from what I
see people wearing out and about.

'I want to cater for everyone – some 
of my dresses are below the knee and have sleeves for people who want to
cover up a bit but I still have shorter and maxi dresses as well for 
day and evening.

'The other week I saw a lady on the train who was 
wearing my dress and she told me she was 65!'

Something for everyone: The star has designed her outfits with women of all sizes and ages in mind (Katlin, £40)

New additions to her burgeoning line, which is sold online on her official web store and in her two boutiques in Brentwood and Basildon, Essex, include the Rochelle maxi dress, neon lime lace Francesca dress, the tunic Matilda dress in orange, the simple and chic Faith dress and a crochet print Monique dress.

'I love the floaty maxi dresses like my Rochelle and the Rhianna skater dress for the daytime and the Giselle and simple, chic Faith dress for glam nights out.

'I have also added in some really cute leisurewear and playsuits like Ashley and Nicole that are perfect for the beach that have gorgeous detailing on them,' explained Amy.

Stylish comfort: Amy's range includes cosy pieces as well as evening wear and she sourced all the material herself from the Middle East (L) Trinity £70 (R) Ashley £40

Body confident: Amy says she has worked hard for her figure and she is very happy with her curves

Body confident Amy, who has been flaunting her curvy figure in Marbella in recent weeks, wants her dresses to make women look and feel amazing in the skin they're in.

After running the London Marathon earlier this year, she is now an advocate for healthy living.

She said: 'It’s so important to look after yourself inside and out. I’ve been criticised about the way I look and even been asked if I have had lipo.

'I want girls to know they can stay fit by eating well and working out. Since I finished training for the marathon I just do my fitness DVD three times a week.

'I feel really confident at the moment and think I have curves in the right place but I’m not too skinny.'
