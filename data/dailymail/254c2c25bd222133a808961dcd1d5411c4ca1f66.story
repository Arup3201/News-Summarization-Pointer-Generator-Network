A musician selling a charity calendar claims he is struggling to offload the remaining copies - because he put expenses scandal MP Maria Miller on the front.

Singer Brian James from Basingstoke, Hampshire, created the five pound calendars putting Mrs Miller in pride of place on the front page.

Mr James created the calendars  - which feature buskers pictured with people in the public eye - to raise money for BBC's Children in Need.

Singer Brian James - who claims no-one will buy his charity calendar because Maria Miller MP is on the front cover. He is now planning on emailing the MP and asking for a donation

But having raised £1,100 by selling 220 copies sales have stopped since the MP's expenses scandal.

Mr James believes anger in the town towards the MP has hampered his attempts to sell the remaining load.

He is even considering emailing her for £250, the cost of the remaining calenders, as he can't shift them.

Maria Miller reads an apology statement in the House of Commons in London over her parliamentary expenses. She stepped down from her role shortly afterwards

He said: 'It was going so well. I wish I had never put her on the front now.

'The public won't buy it because she is on the front, and it is a bit annoying really. No-one will buy them.

'I will be emailing her and I will be asking for £250 because I am stuck with them.'

The Conservative MP resigned from her Cabinet position as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on April 9.

Her decision to step down came after it was revealed she over-claimed mortgage payments on her second home in Wimbledon, south London.

She was told to repay £5,800 by the Parliamentary Committee on Standards - despite Parliamentary Commissioner Kathryn Hudson originally recommending she pay back £45,800.

There had been mounting pressure for the MP to resign from Labour and Conservative politicians alike.

At the time, she said the row had been an 'enormous distraction' from 'the incredible achievements of this government'.

Conservative MP Sajid Javid was named as the new culture secretary, while Mrs Miller remains the member of parliament for Basingstoke.
