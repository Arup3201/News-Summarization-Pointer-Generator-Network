Stable: Nelson Mandela, will be discharged from hospital, ex-president Mbeki said

Nelson Mandela will soon be discharged
from hospital to recuperate at home, according to former South African 
president Thabo Mbeki.

‘I am quite certain that one of these days Madiba (Mandela) will go back home,’ he said at the weekend.

Official statements that South 
Africa’s first  black president was critical but stable were correct, he
said, at a memorial service in Pretoria on Saturday.

He added: 'One of
these days the doctors will agree that he can go and stay at home 
rather than in hospital.’

Mandela’s wife Graça Machel also said she was ‘less anxious’ about his condition.

‘He continues to respond positively to treatment. I would say that today I am less anxious than I was a week ago,’ she said.

The former apartheid campaigner has 
been hospitalised for more than five weeks for a recurring lung 
infection, which has led to four hospital stays in the last six months.

Friends who have visited him say he is
on a life support machine - and court papers alleged he was in a 
persistent vegetative state - but recent official updates have said 
Mandela was in a critical but stable condition.

Mandela, who was hospitalized on June
8, turns 95 on Thursday.

He spent 27 years in prison before becoming South Africa’s first black president in 1994.

Last week, a close friend of 
Mandela contradicted the court reports that he was ‘totally conscious’ 
when he visited him in hospital this week.

Update: Graca Machel spoke about her husband's condition at a fundraising drive for a children's hospital that will be named after the 94-year-old anti-apartheid leader

Denis
Goldberg, a white anti-apartheid activist and stalwart of the ruling 
African National Congress (ANC), contradicted that medical opinion 
presented in court, which stated that Mandela has been in a ‘vegetative 
state’ for the last nine days and his family had discussed switching off
his life support machine.

Goldberg,
who was jailed for 22 years during the infamous Rivonia trial of 1964 
that saw Mandela imprisoned for life, insisted that he had visited 
Mandela on Monday and he that ‘he is clearly a very ill man, but he 
responds to voices and tries to talk.’

He added: ‘He was dozing when I got 
there. I spoke and told him who I was and he opened his eyes and looked 
at me. I spoke to him for about ten minutes and he responded positively 
to what I was saying. He was aware of who I was.'
