Andy Murray wants to work with coach Amelie Mauresmo for the 'long term'.

The Scot announced he had hired the French former Wimbledon champion shortly before the grass-court season, but the partnership could not help Murray retain his title at the All England Club as he exited at the quarter-final stage.

But, speaking ahead of this week's Rogers Cup in Toronto, the British number one insisted the link-up has been a positive experience.

Partnership: Murray and Mauresmo will continue to work together after enjoying their time so far

Experience: Mauresmo, who won two Grand Slams as a player, joined Murray to offer a new perspective

He told BBC Sport: 'We've agreed to work together and I think from both sides we're willing to do what it takes to make it work long term.

'I really enjoy working with her, she's helped me a lot.

'She integrated well with the rest of the team. It's been a good start. Now it's about me producing the results.'

Preparation: Murray was talking before the Rogers Cup in Toronto as he starts working towards the US Open
