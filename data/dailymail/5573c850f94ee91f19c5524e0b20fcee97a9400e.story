After originating in the U.S., cake smash parties have been taking the UK by storm as parents look for a fun and memorable way to mark their child's first birthday.

The trend involves letting a one-year-old loose with a giant cake while being pictured by a professional photographer, creating some cheeky and adorable shots their mothers and fathers can treasure forever.

But babies playing with food can inevitably lead to a big mess - which is why the trend has now moved on to include the little ones having a bath after they have smashed a cake.

Dubbed 'Smash and Splash' parties, the idea has again come from the U.S. but British photographer Lauren Murphy told MailOnline it is becoming increasingly popular over here. 

She said: 'Cake smash and tub time sessions have been extremely popular in the last year. Cake smashes were ranked one of the top "weird and wonderful" trends of 2014 on popular parenting website Netmums. 

'I do several cake smashes per week and parents always rave about how much fun they all had at the shoots.'

Lauren, who is based in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, said she loves taking the pictures at Smash and Splash parties as much as the babies enjoy taking part. 

She said: 'I LOVE doing cake smash shoots. They allow me to develop the creative side of my personality by developing every aspect of the set ups. I love that I can play a very small part in such a special moment in the baby and parents lives.'

She added: 'The babies always have fun at the cake smash sessions, some may not like the texture of the cake but love the taste, others may love the texture and making a mess but prefer not to eat the cake, it's all part of the fun! 

'The tub time at the end of the shoot is always a huge hit, all babies love the bubbly fun and always have lots of smiles for the camera.'

Asked why she thinks so many parents have embraced the concept, Lauren said: 'Let's face it every parent loves to see their child having fun. This is exactly what cake smash and tub time sessions are about, parents love to watch their baby explore and taste the cake which always results in fun, creative and sometimes messy photos. 

'Babies aged one have very short concentration spans therefore the cake smashes allow them to do what babies do best…explore!'

Fun: Photographer Lauren Murphy believes the concept has been popular because the babies get to have fun while the parents get a memorable photo. Pictured is Macy Gordon

Caught on in the UK: The trend started in the U.S before coming here and has moved on to include bath time as well as cake smashing

The photographer charges £95 for her cake smash package which includes tub time and two prints.

The cake, handmade outfits and balloons are included in the price and the shoots take place at her state-of-the-art studio.

It might seem like a lot to pay on a one-year-old's birthday but parents who have done it said they thought it was worth it. They and their child had a fun experience, while they also have photos to last a lifetime.

Jennifer Muir from Burnside, Glasgow, booked a session for her son, Blake. She said: 'I wanted do to something special to celebrate Blake's first birthday. I considered having a party however I just felt that at such a young age he wouldn't understand the concept that people were there for him. 

The bath element means babies can get cleaned up after getting covered in cake and provides the opportunity for more adorable pictures, as demonstrated by Orla Ogilvie, pictured

'The cake smash and splash was perfect as he is so inquisitive so he didn't think twice about getting stuck into the cake. We all had a great day, the cake was delicious and I will have photographs which I will treasure forever.' 

Another fan is Claire McKinney, from Glasgow, who said: 'The cake smash and tub time was a fun way of capturing my daughter, Lottie, when she is happy - an enjoyable pleasant experience for both of us.'

Meanwhile Amy Pearson from Coltness, Wishaw, whose daughter Orla Ogilvie had a cake smash and splash shoot when she turned one said: 'We loved the idea of something different rather than the original photos everyone gets done.'
