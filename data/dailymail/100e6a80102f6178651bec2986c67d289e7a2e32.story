A Chinese businessman wanted by police for the murders of a family of four has appeared in court for the first time after being extradited to the UK.

Anxiang Du was arrested in Morocco last year on suspicion of killing university lecturer Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding, his wife Ge 'Helen' Chui and their two daughters Alice, 12, and Xing, 18.

He had been on the run for 14 months and was found working on a building site and sleeping rough in a half-built block of flats.

Remanded in custody: Anxiang Du, pictured covering his face as he arrives at Northampton Magistrates Court today, is accused of murdering a family of four and then fleeing the UK

He appeared at Northampton Magistrates' Court today where he spoke through a Mandarin translator to give his date of birth and an address before
 being remanded into custody.

The court heard he was arrested yesterday evening after being extradited from Morocco.District Judge Timothy Deber sent the case to Northampton Crown Court and remanded Du, who appeared wearing a white hooded top and flanked by two armed police officers, into custody.

He will appear at Northampton Crown Court on March 15.

An international manhunt was launched to find Anxiang Du after he 'went on the run for 14 months'

Mr Du, from Coventry, worked at a herbal
 medicine shop in Birmingham but disappeared the day after losing a 
court battle over his shared business interests with the Ding family.

An international man hunt was launched but Du managed to evade capture in Morocco - despite being arrested just five days after the killings.

Moroccan police let him go because British police failed to let Interpol know he was a wanted man, it was claimed at the time.

He was finally caught after the owner of the building site saw his picture in a local newspaper and called police.

Mr Du's extradition was approved by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice and the Home Office in the UK and he was flown back from Casablanca yesterday afternoon.

The 53-year-old arrived at Heathrow airport around 4pm and was taken into custody by the Metropolitan police.

Deputy Chief Constable Martin Jelley said: 'On behalf of Northamptonshire Police, I would like to thank all those who have been involved in this successful extradition, including Michael Ellis MP for his considerable support in progressing this with the relevant authorities.'

Mr Ding worked as a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University while his wife worked locally at a school in Northampton.
