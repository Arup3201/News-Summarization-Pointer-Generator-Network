A family who spent £3,000 painting their waterfront house bright yellow have blasted council bosses who told them they would have to change the colour.

Stefano Varese, 41, and his elder brother Eduardo, 43, have branded the decision by planners 'absurd' and vowed to fight the move.

Officials at Inverclyde Council refused the Varese family permission to keep the lemon zest colour scheme of their home in Greenock, western Scotland, and labelled it 'an intrusive feature within the streetscape' that was not in-keeping with the area.

Council officials say the house is 'an intrusive feature within the streetscape' and not in-keeping with the area

Eduardo Varese and his younger brother Stefano have been told they will have to change the colour of their home in Greenock, western Scotland after they spent £3,000 painting it yellow

Mr Varese, who has lived at the four-storey property with his parents Adriano, 79, and Edilia, 80, since 1985, said he would appeal the decision.

He pointed out the house has been painted white, cream, pink, blue and turquoise in the past without any issues.

He said: 'I find it absurd and crazy that it was turned down, especially as there were 31 people in support of the house and only five objections.

'My immediate neighbours are also supportive so I'm genuinely surprised.

'I just don't understand why the council could refuse this when I think they have better things to be worried about in town. Of course we are appealing it.'

His elder brother added: 'We have been left shocked by this and plan to fight it. We hadn't realised we would need permission just to paint the house but applied retrospectively.

'But to be told we must change it beggars belief. We plan to speak to our local politicians and hopefully have this reversed.'

The row erupted after complaints from a handful of locals at a community council meeting. Planning bosses said the colour goes against the local development plan and guidance from Historic Scotland.

The brothers say the colour was chosen to reflect the family's 'Mediterranean heritage' and the property's 'seaside setting'

The property will have to be repainted in a 'soft, pastel hue' unless the decision can be overturned.

A planning report stated: 'The bright yellow and gold tones of the dwelling are not colours which would traditionally have been used on a house of this period style or have been found within this part of the Greenock West End Conservation Area.

'The colours form an intrusive feature within the streetscape and are therefore not appropriate.

'There is no objection to the use of colour on The Esplanade to add variety to the appearance. However, the shades would require to be derived from soft, pastel hues found in traditional limewashing which are appropriate to the period of the buildings.'

Mr Varese told planners the colour was chosen to reflect the family's 'Mediterranean heritage' and the property's 'seaside setting'.

There were five public objections including claims houses in the area were designed as 'elegant mansions' and looked good in stone or white.

Mr Varese, whose now-retired parents moved to Scotland from La Spezia in northern Italy and ran successful chain of takeaway shops, added: 'It's not intrusive and if you have a look throughout the conservation area you will see that there are other houses painted in bright colours.

'I would understand it if the property was derelict or not maintained then obviously people would complain. But there is no issue here.

'We genuinely like the colour yellow and wanted to bring a bit of charm to the place and paint it a nice colour which is in line with the riverside location.'

A Facebook page set up supporting the family has received more than 250 likes.
