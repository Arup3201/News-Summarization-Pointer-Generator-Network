Jodi Arias took the stand at her murder trial today and immediately told jurors that she had killed her lover in self-defense.

When asked by the defense if she had killed on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander - who was stabbed 27 times and shot in the head - Arias softly said 'Yes'.

When asked by defense attorney Kirk
Nurmi why she had killed Alexander at his Mesa home in June 
2008, Arias responded: 'The simple answer is that he attacked me and I defended myself.'

'In self-defense': Jodi Arias took the stand in her own defense today and admitted to the jury in Mesa, Arizona that she had killed lover Travis Alexander

The 32-year-old, wearing a black T-shirt and glasses, also revealed to the courtroom in Mesa, Arizona that she had planned to commit suicide shortly after Alexander's death.

Arias had said in a TV interview in September 2008 - three months after Alexander was killed in the bloody attack - that 'no jury would ever convict her' of his murder.

At the time she claimed it was because she had not killed him but today Arias said she had planned to take her own life.

She said today: 'I was very confident that no jury would convict me because I was sure I'd be dead. Those are probably the most bitter words I'll ever eat.'

The decision to put Arias on the stand came as a surprise as she faces death row if she's convicted of murdering Alexander.

Composed: Arias appeared on the stand today in Arizona where she told the court that she had been repeated beaten by her parents as a child

The defense team for Arias hopes the testimony will show that she killed him in self defense after he mistreated her for months and was possessive.

The jury were shown pink panties today with 'Travis' emblazoned across them. A computer forensic examiner testified that he recovered a photo of the underwear on July 12, 2008 more than a month after Alexander was killed.

The prosecution questioned the forensics worker as to whether the picture appeared staged but he said he was unaware of the context.

However the prosecution says Arias was 'obsessed' with Alexander and flew into a jealous rage when he revealed he wanted to start dating someone else.

On the stand today, she was told several times to speak up and move closer to the microphone. Jurors watched Arias closely while some took notes.

Arias told the court today that she had been severely beaten as a child by her mother and father when she lived in California and also by the first boyfriend she ever loved.

Alexander's family listened in the courtroom as she spoke, some unable to raise their eyes to look at Arias. Alexander's sister Tanisha Sorenson watched every word of Arias' testimony with an unflinching gaze.

Arias wept as she told the court: 'I'm very nervous today. Life was ideal up until I was aged seven. Parents would spank us and around seven-years old it started getting more intense.

'My dad started using a belt. My mom began to carry a wooden spoon on her purse.'

She continued: 'It was a wooden kitchen spoon and if we misbehaved she would use it on my brother and I, she would hit us hard with it.

'It left welts on my body. Dad didn't leave welts as often as my mom - she also used a belt. My dad was quite intimidating so didn’t need to use strength to get his point across. My mother did.'

Volatile relationship: Arias had dated Travis Alexander for five months but continued a casual sexual relationship with him after the split up

Arias was asked in court this afternoon if she loved her mother, to which she quietly responded, 'yes'.

She talked at length about the relationship she had with her parents growing up and claimed she was subjected to beatings. 

'They were intense and increased in frequency as I got older,' Arias said. 'I don't recall how many times a week but it could be any thing from four times a week to once every two weeks.

'I didn't like being hit so I would squirm around a little but the more we did the harder we would get hit.

'My mother broke my brother's hand once when he tried to block one of her blows. As I got into a teenager, my dad would get rougher and rougher.'

She added: 'When I was younger I remember feeling betrayed and confused that my mother was beating me.

'As I got older it made me mad and I didn't get why she was punishing me. I was mad at her and it hurt. I loved her but it put a strain on our relationship.

'My dad never beat me with his fist - he would just shove me into furniture and the piano, tables, desk, chairs, whatever was around. One time I even passed out. 

'This was when I was 16 or 17. Not as often with my dad as with my mum. If I did something to upset them it would happen. Sometimes I got grounded. I loved my father even when he was beating me.'

Arias told the packed courtroom that the beatings continued throughout the time she was in high school.

In one incidence, Arias had sneaked out at night with friends and when her parents woke up and found out, she claimed her father hit her across the face, knocking her to the ground.

Following a brief recess on Monday afternoon, Arias returned to the stand where she discussed an earlier relationship in 1999 with a man called Bobby Juarez, who she described as her 'first true love'.

She said that she moved in with Juarez because she had become frustrated with her parents and how they treated her.

Arias described the relationship as 'good' until Juarez was unfaithful with a girl he met on a partyline 900 number. She also told the jury that the boyfriend once put her in a stranglehold and almost broke her arm during an argument.

Following the end of the relationship with Bobby, Arias said that she moved in with her grandparents because she did not want to return to the atmosphere of her parents' house.

However Arias said that she resumed a casual, sexual relationship with Arias because she felt the violence was 'isolated incidents'.

The trial finished for the day with Arias telling the court of how she later moved in with Juarez's roommate and began a romantic relationship with him. She is expected to return to the stand tomorrow.
