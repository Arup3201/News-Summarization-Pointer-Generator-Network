There are plenty of properties on the Cornish coast with beautiful sea views, but not many public toilets that can say the same.

But one loo has such a 'jaw-dropping' view, it has gone on sale and could fetch as much as £95,000.

The 502 sq ft public toilet in Charlestown, Cornwall, along with its grounds, is being auctioned by Clive Emson later this month and has a freehold guide price of £75,000 to £95,000.

Boasting panoramic sea views, the property is said to have 'potential for a fantastic family home'

Graham Barton, auctioneer and regular on BBC One's Homes Under The Hammer, said: 'This is arguably the most gloriously located residential development opportunity for sale in Cornwall today.

'It has stunning panoramic and jaw-dropping sea views.'

He explained: 'The property looks southwards across St Austell Bay with the historic harbour at its western edge.

'We are expecting strong interest at auction as there is huge potential for a fantastic family home or holiday home with extension or complete replacement among the options subject to planning consent.'

Charlestown is famed for its scenic locations often featuring in TV and films such as Doctor Who and Pirates of the Carribean.

The auction will take place at the St Mellion International Resort near Saltash at 11am on Thursday, March 26.
