Football fans often complain about the sky-high prices of food and drink at matches but they will be in for a pleasant surprise at the World Cup.

Instead of paying £5-a-pint for watered-down beer, a 473ml can of Brazil's own Brahma 'cerveja' will cost R$10, around £2.65.

Budweiser is also available, at the slightly more costly £3.50, for the same amount.

Pleasant reading: The price list for food and drink at World Cup stadiums has been revealed 

Soft drinks like Coca-Cola, Kuat Guarana and Sprite (600ml) will be around £2.15, while mineral water (500ml) is £1.60.

But what other nourishment will you be able to find in Brazil's 12 World Cup stadiums?

All the chocolate on offer costs £2.15, including the Talento Castanha do Para - a 100g block of milk chocolate with Brazil nuts (what else?).

There's also a three-pack of Fuleco crunchy chocolate and a four pack of Baton milk chocolate, both for the same price.

Salted peanuts, cheese tortilla chips, and crisps are also £2.15, if fans want something to snack on to ease the nerves ahead of a penalty shoot-out.

A double cheeseburger is available for £3.50, while vegetarians can pick up the veggie sandwich for £2.65.

Meanwhile, a double hot-dog is available at the same price, along with a chicken salad sandwich and a turkey and cheese sandwich.

Furthermore, each region can offer a local delicacy, with Manaus serving up Tambaqui fish and chips for £3.50 and Belo Horizonte selling Tropieiro beans for £4.

Unless FIFA make any sudden adjustments, it looks like football isn't the only thing the fans will be feasting on this summer.
