Tottenham have announced that Jermain Defoe will link up with the club to train and maintain his fitness as a return to the Premier League remains a possibility.

Defoe left White Hart Lane last January to move to Major League Soccer having penned a deal with Toronto FC , but has been heavily linked with a comeback with the likes of QPR and Leicester believed to be keen on a move for the 32-year-old striker.

Spurs confirmed the news via their official Twitter account, writing: 'We can confirm that @IAmJermainDefoe will train with our Development Squad for the next week to maintain fitness during MLS close season.'

The former West Ham and Portsmouth forward enjoyed a blistering start to his career in MLS, scoring 11 goals in his opening 16 league games for Toronto before his relationship with the club soured.

Having missed out on a place in England's World Cup squad last summer, Defoe could return to the Premier League and will want to use his time with Tottenham's youth set-up to keep in peak condition should he find himself signing terms in the coming month.

The striker made 274 Premier League appearances for Spurs over two spells at White Hart Lane, netting 90 goals.
