It has famously been a showcase for fast cars, flash watches and high-class liquor - but the latest Bond instalment is set to go one step further by promoting an entire country for tax-breaks.

The new movie, Spectre, will be a truly pro-Mexican affair with beautiful shots of the country, a leading role for one of the nation's most glamorous actress and a strict rule that Bond's nemesis is not from Mexico.

In exchange for these considerable lengths, the Hollywood producers making the film, who are under pressure to cut their huge budget, will have an extra £14million to spend how they choose.

Starring role: Glamorous Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman was recently unveiled as new Bond girl Estrella 

The Central American country, where the iconic opening scene takes place, offered Hollywood producers a fortune as an incentive to film there, but their generosity came with conditions.  

Stephanie Sigman, one of Mexico's rising stars, was recently unveiled as Bond girl Estrella, appearing alongside Italian Monica Bellucci, who plays Lucia Sciarra.

The Mexican actress, 27, is best known for her role in the award-winning Mexican film Miss Bala, in which she played a beauty queen forced to do a gang's dirty work after witnessing a murder. 

In addition, Mexico also asked that an assassination target in the film, the Mayor of Mexico City, be changed to an international leader, The Telegraph reports.

Tax incentives: It is believed that Hollywood producers making the new Bond movie will save as much as £14million by showing Mexico in a favourable light

These measures are said to have secured tax breaks worth £10million.

Around £4million was said to have been earned by filming flattering shots of the country's 'modern' skyline and replacing a cage fighting scene with footage of Mexico's renowned Day of the Dead festivities.

Stephanie Sigman will be the first Mexican-born Bond girl on the big screen, but not the first overall. 

Mexico's Linda Christian - the original Bond girl - starred in the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale.

The movie's alterations were reported by US website Tax Analysts, which provides information on tax news, based on emails leaked in last year's Sony hacking scandal.

Large numbers of internal emails were released by Guardians of the Peace, which the FBI has since identified as a North Korean-backed group of hackers.

According to the leaked emails Spectre's budget was at one point exceeding £200 million - which would have made it one of the most expensive films in history.

Studio executives spoke of being under 'immense pressure' to reduce the budget. The plan to give Mexico a flattering portrayal was outlined in a memo titled 'Elements needed to preserve Mexican deal'.

It spoke of how producers should cast a 'known Mexican actress' as Estrella and female villain Sciarra 'cannot be Mexican'. 

It also called for aerial shots of 'modern Mexico City buildings'.

Another condition: Other leaked Sony emails suggested Bond producers were asked to film shots with Mexico's 'modern' skyline in the background 

Other emails suggested the Mayor of Mexico City should no longer be assassinated while it was decided Bond would steal Sciarra's helicopter and take off 'into the Mexican skyline'.

A senior studio executive later wrote to producers saying: 'You have done a great job in getting us the Mexican incentive. 

'By all accounts we can still get the extra $6M by continuing to showcase the modern aspects of the city, and it sounds like we are well on our way based on your last scout. Let's continue to pursue whatever avenues we have available to maximise this incentive.'

In an email Amy Pascal, the former co-chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, added: 'We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money.'

Sony Pictures Entertainment has not  commented on the Mexico tax incentives. 

The new film, set to be released in the autumn, had  budget exceeding £200million, which would have made it one of the most expensive movies in history
