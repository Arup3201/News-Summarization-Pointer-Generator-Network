Tensions: Downing Street insiders have expressed alarm at Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's recent outbursts

Philip Hammond could quit the Cabinet over fresh spending cuts to the armed forces, it was claimed today.

The Defence Secretary’s future is the subject of increased government speculation after speaking out on Europe, gay marriage and cutting welfare.

Aides sought to scotch the rumours, insisting he remains one of David Cameron’s most loyal ministers.

But some in the Tory party believe he is 'on manoeuvres'.

Government departments are locked in a battle with the Treasury over their budgets for 2015-16.

Chancellor George Osborne will set out details of an extra £11.5billion next month, but Treasury sources say ‘some ministers have been more helpful than others’ in finding ways to cut spending by up to 10 per cent.

Mr Hammond is among ministers demanding a fresh squeeze on welfare to avoid deep cuts in vital services, such as the Army and flood defences.

Senior Downing Street insiders have expressed dismay at a ‘pattern of behaviour’ from the 57-year-old who has repeatedly spoken out on issues designed to appeal to Tory traditionalists.

And the Finanical Times reported: 'Some Tories speculate that the 57-year-old Mr Hammond, who was previously considered somewhat grey and ultraloyal, might even quit rather than implement further cuts to the armed forces, setting himself up as a leader of the Tory right.'

But a source close to Mr Hammond dismissed the idea he was ready to walk out of the government.

‘He is one of the most loyal members of the government. He has no truck with any suggestion that he is trying to be difficult.’

Mr Hammond believes the spending review has been a ‘grown-up exercise’ and has ‘found some efficiency savings’.

However,
others in government believe co-operation behind the scenes is in 
contrast with public utterances apparently at odds with the Prime 
Minister.

A week ago he claimed plans to legalise gay marriage are fuelling ‘a realm sense of anger’ among voters.

Mr  Cameron’s flagship policy had unnecessarily upset ‘vast numbers of people’, he added.

That outburst came just days after Mr 
Hammond said he would vote for Britain to leave the European Union if a 
referendum was held now.

In a sign of the irritation in Number 10, insiders made clear Mr Cameron’s unhappiness with Ministry of Defence guidance that soldiers should not wear uniforms in public after the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby.

The ban was put into place immediately after Wednesday’s brutal attack in Woolwich, but was scaled back after a meeting of the government’s emergency Cobra meeting yesterday morning.

Mr Cameron is understood to have told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was ‘seriously dismayed’ at official guidance given to personnel in London following the murder.

Insisting that the ban be rescinded, Mr Cameron told a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall: ‘The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal.’

The dressing down was a blow for Mr Hammond, who is understood to have agreed that the uniform ban should be implemented.
