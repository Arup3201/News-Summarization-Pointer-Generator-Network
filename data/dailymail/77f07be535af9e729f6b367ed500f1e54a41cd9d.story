Beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean, by the idyllic islands of Reunion and Mauritius, there lies traces of an ancient, hidden continent, new research claims.

The continent fragment known as Mauritia detached about 60million years ago while Madagascar and India drifted apart, researchers say, and had lain concealed beneath huge masses of lava.

And it appears such micro-continents hidden beneath the oceans occur more frequently than previously thought, says a study in the latest issue of Nature Geoscience.

Paradise beach: An international team of researchers deduced the existence of a lost continent beneath the waters of the Indian Ocean through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of Mauritius

Mauritia was a strip of land which was once tucked between India and Madagascar - two landmasses now separated by thousands of miles of deep ocean, but which were then next door to each other.

An international team of researchers deduced its existence through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of Mauritius.

The grains were dated back to a volcanic eruption which took place about nine million years ago, but analysis showed they contained minerals that were much older.

Professor Trond Torsvik, from the University of Oslo, Norway, told the BBC: 'We found zircons that we extracted from the beach sands, and these are something you typically find in a continental crust. They are very old in age.'

The break-up of continents is often associated with geological phenomena known as mantle plumes.

These are giant bubbles of hot rock which rise from deep within our planet and soften tectonic plates from below, until the plates break apart at the hotspots.

This is how Eastern Gondwana broke apart about 170million years ago.

At first, one part was separated, which in turn fragmented into Madagascar, India, Australia and Antarctica, which then migrated to their present position.

Plumes currently sitting beneath the islands Maritius and Reunion appear to have played a role in the emergence of the Indian Ocean.

If the zone of the rupture lies at the edge of a land mass (in this case Madagascar and India), fragments of this land mass may be separated off.

The Seychelles are a well-known example of such a continental fragment.

The coloured track (left colour scale) west of Reunion is the calculated movement of the Reunion hotspot. The black lines with yellow circles and the red circle indicate the corresponding calculated track on the African plate and the Indian plate, respectively. The numbers in the circles are ages in millions of years. The areas with topography just below the sea surface are now regarded as continental fragments

An underwater 'Grand Canyon' has been captured in a series of spectacular images created by a Royal Navy survey ship.

HMS Enterprise discovered the 250 metre-deep canyon in the Red Sea during a nine-month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of Suez.

The 3D images were created after the ship left the Egyptian port of Safaga and were made using the Devonport-based survey ship's multibeam echo sounder.

Commander Derek Rae, commanding officer of HMS Enterprise, said: 'These features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the Red Sea flooded millennia ago.'

A group of geoscientists from Norway, South Africa, Britain and Germany have now published research that suggests, based on the study of lava sand grains from the beach of Mauritius, the existence of further fragments.

The sand grains contain semi-precious zircons aged between 660 and 1,970million years, which is explained by the fact that the zircons were carried by the lava as it pushed through subjacent continental crust of this age.

This dating method was supplemented by a recalculation of plate tectonics, which explains exactly how and where the fragments ended up in the Indian Ocean.

Dr Bernhard Steinberger of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and Dr Pavel Doubrovine of Oslo University calculated the hotspot trail.

'On the one hand, it shows the position of the plates relative to the two hotspots at the time of the rupture, which points towards a causal relation,' said Dr Steinberger.

'On the other hand, we were able to show that the continent fragments continued to wander almost exactly over the Reunion plume, which explains how they were covered by volcanic rock.'

So what was previously interpreted only as the trail of the Reunion hotspot, are continental fragments which were previously not recognised as such because they were covered by the volcanic rocks of the Reunion plume.

It therefore appears that such micro-continents in the ocean occur more frequently than previously thought.
