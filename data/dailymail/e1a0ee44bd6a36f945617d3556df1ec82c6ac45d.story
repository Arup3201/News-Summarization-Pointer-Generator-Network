Let go: Yoga instructor Alice Van Ness has been fired for her disapproving stink-eye glare at a Facebook employee using a cellphone in class

A yoga instructor was fired for her ‘strict’ behaviour after enforcing her no cell phone policy at a class at Facebook’s Menlo Park campus earlier this month.

Alice Van Ness, who has been teaching yoga for years, has always kept her policy – cell phones turn off when her classes begin.

But according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Ms Van Ness was let go last month after asking a Facebook employee at the California campus to shut off her phone mid-class.

The Facebook employee complained to Ms Van Ness’ contracting company, Plus One Health Management, who decided to terminate her.

She said in the complaint that Ms Van Ness glared at her, though the yoga instructor said it was nothing more than a 'disapproving look.'

Plus One Health said at the time: ‘We are in the business of providing great customer service,’ her notice read, according to the Chronicle. ‘Unless a client requires us to specifically say no to something, we prefer to say yes whenever possible.’

Increasingly, yoga studios across the country have posted strict no-phone policies amid a new generation of smart phone users addicted to checking emails, Twitter, the news, and Facebook.

Ms Van Ness said she initially asked all people in the class at Facebook to turn off any electronic devices before she began.

But the Facebook employee in the front of the class could not bear to be out of the know for the entirety of the class, and attempted to check it halfway through the session.

Though Ms Van Ness said she only gave the employee a disapporiving look, that was enough for the worker to file a complaint.

‘I’m sure my look said it all,’ she told the paper. ‘Really? Your email is more important than understanding your body?’

She told MailOnline: 'She just thought what was going on at work was more important than yoga, or being there at the time. It's fine if you've got something going on, life still happens, but you're allowed to leave.'

She said she thought it was the least disruptive way of handling it at the time. 'I handled it how I handled it. I’m the teacher. It’s done.

'I don’t think I did anything wrong. I have to stand by my beliefs. That’s the kind of environment I want, and that’s what I have to hold on to.'

The yoga instructor has had brush-in’s with tech-oriented clientele. At Cisco, she had to tell an employee not to take pictures of fellow workers during class.

Representatives for Plus One Health Management did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Facebook simply said: 'Alice Van Ness was not an employee of Facebook, so we are not able to discuss this matter.'

Van Ness said losing the job meant losing a third of her monthly income. But she secured a part-time office job in the mornings, allowing her to teach yoga to children, small classes, and private clients.

'I don’t think I did anything wrong. I have to stand by my beliefs. That’s 
the kind of environment I want, and that’s what I have to hold on to.'

She told MailOnline that in this day and age, many people could use the hour or so of silence that yoga allows. 'I love to go in on lunchtime and give people that break. It’s so rewarding to walk into an office, and they take an hour and they’ve taken that time for themselves,' she said.

'I feel like the people in corporate environments are so over-taxed and over-stimulated and have a lot of obligations and responsibilities.' That hour, she explained, allows people the 'space to connect and do what they need to do, and what's healthy for them.'

And she's keeping her yoga classes cell-phone free.
