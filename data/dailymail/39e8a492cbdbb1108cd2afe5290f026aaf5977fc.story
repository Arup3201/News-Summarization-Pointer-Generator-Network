I do not have a problem with giving second chances to disgraced athletes. 

Redemption stories can provide some of the most uplifting moments in sport and in the past few years I have come to admire Dwain Chambers, a man who will always be known as a drugs cheat, for the way he responded to his downfall.

Third chances are a little more difficult to wrestle with. Recidivism suggests a predilection for cheating the public and one’s fellow competitors that is harder to forgive and which makes it more troublesome to believe that the athlete has reformed.

Sprinter Justin Gatlin signed a lucrative sponsorship contract with Nike this week

Gatlin has twice been convicted of using performance enhancing drugs

Gatlin's deal with Nike has been met with some unfavourable responses from key figures in athletics

What I really have a problem with, though, is rewarding an athlete who has cheated twice with a big, fat sponsorship deal. What I really have a problem with is somehow legitimising the taking of performance-enhancing drugs in sport by making a cheat look cool.

That’s what Nike have done. That’s the message they have sent out by giving a new sportswear deal to twice-convicted drugs cheat Justin Gatlin in the build-up to this year’s World Championships in Beijing.

Nike don’t do shame. They just do shock. But they should be ashamed of themselves for this. They should be ashamed of the message they are sending out at a time when athletics desperately needs its stance on PEDs to be unequivocal.

Nike are cool. They make it their business to make their athletes appear cool, too. They turn them into people their youth-orientated customers want to emulate. And now they are going to do that with USA sprinter Gatlin who, in the absence of Usain Bolt, ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the world last year. Cheats do prosper after all then.

Let’s remind ourselves about Gatlin. He was first banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs in 2001 after testing positive for amphetamines. Gatlin claimed he had been taking medication for Attention Deficit Disorder. His two-year ban was reduced.

He won gold in the 100m at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. Then, in 2006, he tested positive again. He never admitted guilt. His then coach, Trevor Graham, blamed a massage therapist for rubbing cream laced with testosterone into Gatlin’s buttocks without his knowledge. It was ‘the-dog-ate-my-homework’ stuff. Gatlin was banned for eight years this time, a punishment subsequently cut in half.

Gatlin is now 32 but despite his age, is posting some of the fastest times on his career

That should have been enough to put him out of the range of endorsement deals for the rest of his career. But it’s not enough for Nike, apparently, even though they did drop Gatlin after his second positive test. They seem unconcerned. They even seem a little surprised that anyone’s bothered.

‘Earlier in his career,’ Charlie Brooks, Nike’s vice president of communications for North America told Reuters, ‘Justin served the ban that was imposed on him and has been competing again for almost five years.’

Here’s another thing. Here’s the thing that Nike don’t say. Here’s the thing that makes what they are doing even more cynical, even more pathetic. Gatlin is 32 now, a little old for a sprinter, but for some reason, he is managing to run even faster than he was when he was taking performance-enhancing drugs in his prime.

Nike still seem to think it’s worth making Gatlin one of the faces of their brand. They’re desperate, I suppose. Usain Bolt, the man seen as the saviour of athletics, runs with a Puma on his chest. Nike are taking a hell of a beating so they’re gambling on a two-times drug cheat to get them back in the game.

Even Paula Radcliffe, a fellow Nike athlete, sounded appalled. 

‘I am very disappointed to hear this news,’ wrote Radcliffe. ‘I don’t believe it truly reflects the core values of the Nike I am proud to represent, nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that I work with on a daily basis.’

Paula Radcliffe, who is also sponsored by Nike, revealed her dismay at the news of Gatlin's deal

Last year, Gatlin ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the absence of Usain Bolt

To talk about Nike’s integrity and ideals is rather generous. The deal with Gatlin reinforces the idea that Nike’s integrity begins and ends with making money. Their ideals? Please, don’t make me laugh.

If Nike really had any ideals that extended beyond maximising market share, they would not have gone anywhere near Gatlin. It would have known that in the wake of the Russian doping scandal that afflicted athletics last year and added to the cumulative effect of so many previous scandals, the most powerful groups in the sport needed to take a strong stance.

Nike have done the opposite of that. They have caved in to commercial pressure. They have bowed to greed. In the grim struggle against drugs in athletics, this is Nike’s contribution: Just Blew It.

Ten days ago, rookie linebacker Chris Borland quit the San Francisco 49ers at the age of 24 and turned his back on a multi-million dollar contract. He had started thinking about leaving the NFL after getting his ‘bell rung’ and suffering another minor concussion.

He did some research, read about the NFL veterans suffering from dementia, and decided it was time to get out. 

‘I just honestly want to do what’s best for my health,’ Borland told ESPN. ‘From what I’ve researched and what I’ve experienced, I don’t think it’s worth the risk... I’m concerned that if you wait until you have symptoms, it’s too late.’

George North was knocked out for the third time in six weeks playing for Northampton on Friday

I thought about Borland yesterday morning when I read that George North had been knocked out again following a blow to the head during Northampton’s victory over Wasps on Friday.

Six weeks ago, North appeared to be knocked out twice in the course of Wales’ Six Nations defeat to England at the Millennium Stadium. 

That’s some serious damage to his head in a very short space of time. I wonder if he knows Chris Borland’s story and if he ever thinks about getting out before it’s too late?

Some of Lionel Messi’s most enthusiastic and dedicated followers have become so desperate to proclaim him the best there has ever been that they have started to claim triumphs for him where they do not exist.

The little genius of Barcelona has won the Champions League twice but say that to some and they become disproportionately outraged by what they interpret as a vicious calumny. 

This kind of disproportionate outrage, of course, is the lingua franca of social media but it does not change my opinion that you are not entitled to say you have won the Champions League or the European Cup unless you played in the final.

Lionel Messi has played in and won two Champions League finals in 2009 and 2011 for Barcelona

Messi won the competition with Barcelona in 2009 and 2011 but missed the 2006 quarters, semis and final through injury. That means he has won it twice. 

His furious supporters claim that because he played in previous rounds, he is counted as a winner in 2006, too. Because we live in inclusive times, the Barcelona and UEFA websites back up that up.

However, Roy Keane does not feel he deserved to be called a Champions League winner when he missed the final in 1999. I understand Paul Scholes feels the same.

Gary Neville played in the final when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich that year but also appeared in a quarter-final the season United beat Chelsea in Moscow. 

Messi is not considered a three-time Champions League winner as he missed Barcelona's 2006 final

He travelled in the squad to Moscow but did not make the final 18. Neville does not consider that he has won the Champions League twice.

Perhaps the final word should go to Messi. ‘I feel a champion of Spain much more than I feel a champion of Europe,’ he told Graham Hunter in his book, Barca, at the end of the 2005-06 season. Case close
