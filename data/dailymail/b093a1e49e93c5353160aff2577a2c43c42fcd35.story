Australia's Family Feud has been slammed by viewers who have labelled the game show 'sexist' after it asked contestants to name women's jobs and revealed answers that included doing the dishes, cooking and washing clothes.

The line of questioning came from host Grant Denyer on Wednesday night and caused an uproar on social media.

The premise of the Channel Ten show involves two families playing off against each other to name the top eight responses given to a series of questions by 100 Australians.

When the answers were unveiled to include cooking, cleaning, nursing, hairdressing, domestic duties, doing the dishes, being a receptionist and washing clothes, social media sites exploded with viewer outrage.

Emma Jo-Anne wrote on Channel Ten's Facebook page to express her disgust.

'Not sure what year it was, when I turned on Family Feud I could have sworn it was 1950,' she said.

'There is no such thing as a "man's job" or a "woman's job".

'It's incidents like this that stop us bridging the gender equality gap. 

'Women can do whatever we want, as can men. Please think next time before you do something that shows such a narrow minded view of society.'

While Melanie Tee was equally unhappy.

'Am so glad my kids didn't see this rubbish. Needs to be on a (sic) earlier timeslot....like 1952.....#familyfeud #sexism,' she tweeted.

Viewers took to social media to express their outrage at the segment

Some people labelled the answers to the question as outdated, saying the show needed to go back to the 1950s

And Steve Williams shared a male perspective on the situation.

'Interesting grab for publicity @FamilyFeudAU ... "Name a woman's job?" It's 2014. Enjoy your publicity,' he said.

Earlier in the night, Family Feud also asked contestants to name what people thought was a man's job.

Answers included building, mowing the lawn, taking out the bins, being a mechanic and a tradie, plumbing, doing carpentry and fixing things. 

A Channel 10 spokeswoman said: 'Network Ten apologises for including two questions relating to what people think is a man’s job and a woman’s job in the episode of Family Feud which aired last night on Network Ten.

'The questions were ill advised and should not have been included in the show. The survey results are determined by 100 people and we understand they are not reflective of all Australians.'
