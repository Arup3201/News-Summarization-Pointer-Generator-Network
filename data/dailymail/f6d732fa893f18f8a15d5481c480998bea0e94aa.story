Wales manager Chris Coleman insists Real Madrid are happy for Gareth Bale to play on Andorra's 3G pitch should FIFA give the controversial surface the all-clear for their Euro 2016 opener.

Coleman spent last weekend in Madrid where he saw two games and met up with Real boss Carlo Ancelotti and his star man Bale.

Top of the agenda was the playing surface at Andorra's rebuilt 3,300 capacity national stadium where Wales will kick-off their Euro campaign on September 9 - if it passes a FIFA inspection on Friday.

No problem: Real Madrid will allow Gareth Bale to play for Wales on Andorra's artificial pitch

Boost: Wales boss Chris Coleman will be able to call on Bale for his first Euro 2016 qualifier next month

Hennessey (Crystal Palace), Letheren (Dundee), Fon Williams (Tranmere), Chester (Hull), Collins (West Ham), Davies (Tottenham), Gunter (Reading), Matthews (Celtic), Ricketts (Wolves), Taylor (Swansea), Williams (capt, Swansea), Allen (Liverpool), Huws (Manchester City, loan Wigan), King (Leicester), Ledley (Crystal Palace), Ramsey (Arsenal), Vaughan (Nottingham Forest), Bale (Real Madrid), Church (Charlton), Lawrence (Manchester United), Robson-Kanu (Reading), G Williams (Fulham), J Williams (Crystal Palace). 

The new surface will be subjected to laboratory and field tests, determining how the surface reacts to players' skin when sliding, how the ball rolls and bounces on the turf and how it absorbs the shock of a player hitting the floor when falling.

Coleman said Ancelotti has experience of his teams playing on artificial surfaces and was quick to point out the dangers, but the Wales boss is adamant that Bale will be available for the opening game in Group B.

'Ideally we'd be on the grass as we're not used to playing on a 3G pitch,' Coleman said after naming a 23-man squad which includes talented youngsters Tom Lawrence and George Williams, but is without veteran centre-back Danny Gabbidon, now without a club following his summer release by Crystal Palace.

'I was speaking to Carlo and he said when Madrid played on 3G pitch against weaker opposition the players struggled because they didn't like the surface.

'My message to our players is 'forget where we're playing'. We've got to get a result and whatever the surface we've got to get through it and do our job.

'If Fifa say we're not going to play on that pitch and we're going to play on the grass, we'll play on the grass.

'But if they say we've got to play on 3G, we'll play on 3G - and get a result. That's how it is.'

Wise words: Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has spoken to Coleman about playing on artificial pitches

Should FIFA veto the use of Andorra's national stadium, the game could be switched to Barcelona some three hours away - possibly at Espanyol's Estadi Cornella-El Prat.

But Coleman insisted that Bale would travel to Andorra if the game there gets the go-ahead, despite acknowledging that some players have had bad reactions to playing on 3G surfaces.

'Madrid understand Gareth's got a job to play for Wales, if he's available he's going to play,' said Coleman, stressing that his squad would not train on the surface beforehand for fear of picking up injuries.

'Carlo said when they trained on 3G a lot of players had bad reactions, it was tough.

'Some of our players have also trained on a 3G pitch and the reaction a day or two after is not good.

'They're not used to it and we have looked at that and most coaches at our level would not like to play on a 3G pitch.

'It was a bit of a surprise the games were sanctioned so we've simply said can it be looked at and that's what's happened.'

Coleman was also asked whether he would name Ched Evans in his Welsh squad when the Sheffield United striker is released from prison in October.

Evans was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years in prison in April 2012 and news of his imminent release sparked an online petition with over 60,000 people saying he should be prevented from resuming his football career.

'I've not yet had that conversation with anybody at the Football Association of Wales,' Coleman said.

'It's not a five-minute conversation, that's a serious and long conversation before we make any decision.

'I've never met Ched and I can't comment on him but I wouldn't imagine it's going to be easy for him to find himself at the level where he was before.

'But it's up to myself and the FAW to have a conversation about it because it's such a serious matter.'
