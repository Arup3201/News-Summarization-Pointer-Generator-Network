A hitch hiker in New Zealand has been taken on a wild ride he won't forget after being picked up by a man who then led police on a high speed pursuit. 

Police say the vehicle was seen speeding near Opua, Northland in New Zealand Saturday afternoon before a high speed chase commenced. 

But the New Zealand Herald reported the driver, who reached speeds of up to 150 kilometres an hour, did decide to make one stop, he dropped off the hitch hiker before he continued evading police and his car then caught on fire. 

A speeding driver is expected to face court Monday after he took police on a high speed chase near Opua, Northland. During the chase he stopped to let a hitch hiker out before resuming the pursuit

A hitch hiker in New Zealand has been taken on a wild ride he won't forget after being picked up by a man who then led police on a high speed pursuit. Luckily the driver stopped to let him out before continuing the pursuit and his car caught on fire

During the pursuit, it was reported the driver pulled the car to the side of the road and let out his passenger, before proceeding to again reach speed of up to 150 kilometres an hour. 

The pursuit came to an abrupt end when the vehicle caught on fire and drove into scrub before the driver got out and fled on foot.

The New Zealand Herald reported there was suspicion the vehicle may have been used to manufacture methamphetamine but fire crews found that wasn't true when they extinguished it.

Police were soon able to track down the driver and arrest him and it's expected he'll face court on Monday. 

But it hasn't been the only tale of a hitch-hiker in New Zealand caught up in a high speed pursuit.

Last year a Finnish backpacker was picked up by a man who then led police on two pursuits in a stolen car.
