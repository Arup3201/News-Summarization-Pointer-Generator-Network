These photographs show the agony of a Chinese boy as firemen struggled to get a metal nut off of his finger.

They used six different tools to try and remove the ring, which they eventually managed to break.

The boy, from Chongqing, got it stuck after he had been playing around with the nut, slipping it on and off of his fingers.

Firemen struggled for an hour and a half to get this metal bolt off a boy's finger in China this week

This metal file was among the tools the firemen used to try and remove the bolt in Chongqing, China

When it became jammed on a finger on his right hand, the fire service were called.

They spent an hour and a half attempting to remove the nut before finally succeeding.

Starting by using soap and machine oil, they realised they would not be able to pull it off.

The men then started using nail 
clippers, a metal file, large pliers and bolt cutters before finally 
breaking the circular bolt.

Towards the end, the boy can be heard wailing in pain as the men use more and more tools.

Despite his agony, all the boy was left with was a swollen finger.

When it became clear the metal bolt would not slip off, the firemen realised they would need to snap it
