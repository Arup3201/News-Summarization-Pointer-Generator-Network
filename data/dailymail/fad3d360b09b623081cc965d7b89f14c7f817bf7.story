They cost £9billion at a time the country could barely afford it, but four out of five Britons say this summer’s Olympics were well worth the expense.

Months after the Games ended, the expected Olympic hangover has still not hit - and there are signs the resulting feelgood factor has rallied spirits across the nation.

Even after being reminded of the price tag, 78 per cent of voters said the Olympics ‘did a valuable job in cheering up a country in hard times’.

In comparison, just 20 per cent think of the Games as ‘a costly and dangerous distraction’, according to an ICM poll.

The vote of confidence is even higher than during the Games themselves.

In an online survey taken immediately after Super Saturday – on which Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford all gold for Team GB – ICM found that just over half of the population supported the Games, with 35 per cent against.

Asked to reflect on 2012 as a whole - a year which has seen the Diamond Jubilee, the first double-dip recession since the 1970s and volatile weather - 49 per cent of respondents said the last 12 months had made Britain a better place to live, against 41 per cent who said the reverse.

In an ICM poll in December 2011, 60 per cent said they expected Britain would become a more miserable place in 2012.

But politicians have not found it easy to cash in on London 2012's feelgood legacy.

When voters are asked to award a grade to ministers for work completed in the last year alone, David Cameron and Ed Miliband each get a C-, and no senior politician fares any better.

The Queen, in comparison, comes in with a solid B+, with 32 per cent of her enthusiastic subjects awarding her an A+.

In the poll, 79 per cent of men say the Games were 'well worth the cost', as do 77 per cent of women.

In every age bracket, more than three-quarters of people take the same view, with the 80 per cent of 65+ voters who gave the thumbs-up being the most enthusiastic of all.

The vote of confidence was reflected across the region, with the 79 per cent support in the South closely matched by 80 per cent, 74 per cent and 77 per cent respectively in the Midlands, the North and in Wales.

Those in Scotland were not quite as enthusiastic but even so, 69 per cent were in favour of the Games.

Pollsters said the Paralympics may have helped to cement this majority from interviews with 1,002 adults.

A clear margin in favour of London 2012 was found in every social class and in every region.

It seems that a positive public take on the Olympics  has helped to colour wider perceptions of the year - but only 27 per cent believe 2012 allowed Britain to increase its power in the world.

More than double that percentage - 61 per cent - said British power diminished this year.

Furthermore, pessimistic voters continue to expect the slump to drag on.

Asked to look ahead to the end of 2013, 42 per cent expect that Britain will have turned the economic corner, against 51 per cent who believe the country will still be stuck in a downturn.
