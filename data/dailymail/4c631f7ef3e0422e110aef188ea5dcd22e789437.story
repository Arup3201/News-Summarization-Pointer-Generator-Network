England football captain Steven Gerrard will face a court battle in London just weeks before the 2014 World Cup Finals, it has been revealed.

The Liverpool player, his girlfriend Alex, and their mutual friend Lee McPartland are all listed as defendants in a civil case at the High Court.

A man named as Paul Alan Lloyd is bringing the action, which is thought to relate to a fight in the street near the midfielder's home in August.

While reports at the time said Gerrard had been assaulted and verbally abused before the attacker ran away, Lloyd is thought to be claiming damages because his version of events differs.

An unnamed source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Steven and Alex are both huge icons in Liverpool – but there have always been people jealous of their success.

'The pair of them have had no option but to call in lawyers over this matter. It’s a case of conflicting ­explanations as to what happened that night.

'Mr Lloyd believes he has a good case. Steven and the other two might see things one way. But it is certainly not how Mr Lloyd is explaining away events.'

The case will be an unwelcome distraction for manager Roy Hodgson as the team fly out to Brazil for the tournament which starts in June.

Gerrard was left 'badly shaken' after the attack which happened as the star got out of his Range Rover in an upmarket village near to his luxury home.

At the time the 32-year-old sportsman was said to have been alone, but now it appears that his wife and close friend were also in the area.

McPartland runs a runs a corporate hospitality company whose clients include Liverpool FC.

Soon after the incident, a female police officer was arrested in an investigation into whether an attempt was made to obtain CCTV footage of the attack taken from a nearby shop.

PC Helen Jones has now been charged with misconduct in a public office and is due to face a hearing on January 6.

Gerrard, who has been a target in other incidents, was raised in the city's notorious Huyton area.

Last September a fan scaled a perimeter wall at Liverpool’s training ground and yelled threats against his family.

The man sped away on a bike shouting: 'I’ll kill you and your f****** kids.'

In December 2007, masked raiders burst in and confronted 31-year-old Alex as the couple’s children slept.

In 2001, both Steven and Alex faced death threats from members of Liverpool’s underworld.

After Gerrard was said to have been chased by a local criminal through the streets of Liverpool in his car, steel gates 10ft high and state-of-the-art security cameras were put up at the footballer's £3million home.

Liverpool Football Club and the player's agent refused to comment on the allegations.
