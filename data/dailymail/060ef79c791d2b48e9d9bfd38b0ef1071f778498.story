David Cameron was today warned he has been 'complacent' about the risk of Scotland leaving the UK which would trigger a 'national humiliation of catastrophic proportions'.

The Prime Minister and other party leaders were urged by senior Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh to spend the next two weeks focusing on saving the Union.

It came after a poll showed a sharp narrowing in the No campaign's lead, as it emerged Labour voters in Scotland's central belt could decide the outcome of the referendum on September 18.

Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh warned David Cameron against complacency in the run-up to the referendum on September 18

Support for the Yes vote has surged following Mr Salmond's triumph in last week's TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign.

A YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun yesterday showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided. 

The shock surge in support for independence saw the pound tumble to nearly a five-month low and shares in some of Scotland's largest firms, including Royal Bank of Scotland and energy giant SSE, slid.

Sterling fell almost a cent against the US dollar to $1.6510, close to a five-month low of $1.6501. 

It also slipped against the euro and traders warned it is likely to weaken further ahead of September 18.

In Commons today, Sir Edward issued a dire warning about the risk of taking a No vote for granted.

He told the PM: 'For all the reasons that have been given, if we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions. 

'I say gently to the three party leaders that perhaps we have been a bit complacent up to now. I urge them, over the next two weeks, to drop everything else and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight for the Union that we love and believe in.'

Mr Cameron insisted that all party leaders in Westminster have 'put aside their differences and said that, in spite of the political differences we have, we all agree about one thing: not only is Scotland better off inside the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is better off with Scotland inside it'. 

Mr Cameron added: 'As well as being leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister, I am the Member of Parliament for an English seat and I say on behalf of everyone in England and, I believe, in Wales and Northern Ireland, 'We want Scotland to stay.' 

Better Together leader Alistair Darling today said he is 'absolutely confident' that Scots will vote to stay in the UK but conceded the referendum campaign will be a 'race to the wire'.

He brushed aside reports that a source in his Better Together campaign had conceded they could lose the historic ballot.  'That's rubbish, we will win,' he said on a visit to Aberdeen.

At the beginning of August, 18 per of Labour supporters said they would vote Yes in the referendum, but the latest YouGov poll showed the figure had soared to 30 per cent

Tomorrow Labour leader Ed Miliband will head to Central Belt in a desperate attempt to persuade Scottish Labour voters to reject independence, as Alex Salmond woos Labour voters with a promise to end Tory rule north of the border. 

After a sharp rise in support for independence, Labour is drawing up urgent plans to 'unleash big beasts' such as Gordon Brown and former Home Secretary John Reid to help avert a crisis.

Now the No campaign is to step up efforts to target Labour voters, who are said to be switching to back independence. 

At the beginning of August, 18 per of Labour supporters said they would vote Yes in the referendum, but the latest YouGov poll showed the figure had soared to 30 per cent.

The proportion of women backing independence has also risen from 33 per cent to 42 per cent in a month.

Mr Miliband will head to Scotland tomorrow, where he will make a visit to the Central Belt to issue a direct plea to Labour supporters to remain in the Union.

At the same time, Mr Brown has agreed to step up his involvement in the battle against independence.

The former Prime Minister is expected to attend events almost every day between now and the vote on September 18. 

Former Home Secretary John Reid will be sent to the party's Glasgow heartlands to help avert a crisis.

Meanwhile Mr Salmond, and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon, will today target Labour voters in the Borders, Ayrshire and West Lothian.

Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney today claimed Prime Minister's Questions is a reminder to Scots that they are being governed by 'Tory-led governments people in Scotland don't vote for'.

With the penultimate PMQs before the referendum taking place today, Mr Swinney said independence would switch hundreds of millions of pounds of spending from Westminster priorities to Scottish needs.

'The sight of Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons is a stark reminder of what a No vote means - Tory-led governments people in Scotland don't vote for, imposing policies we don't support and charging us for the privilege,' he said.

'A Yes vote means the opportunity to control economic and tax policy so that many more people in Scotland benefit from our wealth and vast natural resources.

'That's why we're better off with Scotland's future in Scotland's hands.'

However, last night it emerged an independent Scotland would be blocked from joining the European Union if Alex Salmond ploughs ahead with his 'bonkers idea' of using the pound.

Brussels chief Olli Rehn warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency.

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the revelation meant an independent Scotland would have to choose between 'using the pound like Panama uses the dollar, or joining the EU'.

Doubts about the currency Scotland would use if it leaves the UK have dominated the debate ahead of the independence referendum on September 18.

Mr Salmond has insisted it would continue to use the pound, entering a currency union with the remaining countries in the Union.

But Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems have all ruled out the plan, making it impossible whoever wins next year's Westminister general election.

Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year, warned it 'would simply not be possible' to become an EU nation if Edinburgh did not have control of its own currency

In a speech last night Mr Alexander released details of a letter from Mr Rehn, who spent a decade as a European Commissioner, including four years as European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro until July this year.

Mr Rehn insisted that any country which wants to join the EU must be 'committed' to the Economic and Monetary Union of the EU.

It means they must have the 'will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course' as well as their own independent central bank.

But if Scotland is using the pound governed from London, it will not have control of bits own currency.

Mr Rehn added: 'As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.'
