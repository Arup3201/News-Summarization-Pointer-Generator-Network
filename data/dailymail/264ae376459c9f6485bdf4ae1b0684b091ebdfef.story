It was most definitely a family affair today as the Royals headed to Sunday service during their stay at the Balmoral estate.

Rather than opt for a chauffeur, a relaxed Prince William drove wife Kate to Crathie Church himself. 

Prince Charles was also in the driving 
seat for the relaxed family trip out and the Duchess of Cornwall, who 
was dressed in tartan, was seen beaming from the 
passenger seat.

The Duchess looked relaxed as she was driven in. There was no sign of baby George who got to meet his great-grandfather Prince Philip for the first time during the trip to Balmoral

Prince William and Kate flew to Scotland earlier this week on a £14million Cessna 750 private jet

Kate wore a simple black hat and matching coat to the service.

However, on there was no sign of Prince George as the Royals headed to the service today.

He had flown with his parents to Scotland on a £14million Cessna 750 private jet earlier in 
the week to meet his great-grandfather Prince Philip for the first time.

Although known as a keen driver, the Queen allowed herself to be chauffeured into church with  Prince Philip.

It is just two days since the Royal couple were pictured behind the wheel of their Range Rovers during a grouse shoot.

The Queen was dressed in a pale green and pink tartan coat and matching hat for the church outing and Prince Philip looked healthy and relaxed as they were driven in.

The Royal family were joined by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his family who had a private audience with the Queen yesterday.

It is thought that Mr Key is the first Kiwi premier to visit the castle.

The newborn prince's first visit to the Queen's Scottish estate offered the opportunity for a unique family photo to be taken.

For
 the first time in more than a century, the family photo will feature 
three generations of heirs to the throne - Prince Charles, 64, Prince 
William, 31, and newborn George.

Her Majesty is known to be a keen 
driver following her time as a driver and mechanic in the Women's 
Auxiliary Territorial Service during the Second World War.

She
 is the only person in the UK who is permitted to drive without a 
licence and is not obliged to have registration plates on her vehicles.

Although the Queen is said to enjoy driving, she tends to restrict her time on the road to visits to her private estates.

Also
 pictured driving to the shoot in a separate Range Rover was Prince 
Phillip who joined the Queen at the Aberdeenshire castle last month 
after recovering from abdominal surgery.

The Queen traditionally spends two months of the summer at Balmoral from the end of July until the end of September.
