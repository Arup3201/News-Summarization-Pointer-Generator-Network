The parents of a popular track star at the University of Pennsylvania who committed suicide on Friday, begged her not to go back to school when she revealed she was unhappy over Christmas.

The death of 19-year-old freshman Madison Holleran has rocked UPenn community and sent shockwaves through her hometown of Allendale, New Jersey.

And the tragedy has come even more into focus as her devastated family and friends have revealed her sadness stemmed from the strains the student found herself under since going to college.

Her father James Holleran told the New York Post the student was struggling with her school workload while a family friend revealed her supportive parents told her she could stay home or transfer at Christmas.

But sadly the determined teen insisted on going back.

Holleran posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to her Instagram account around 6pm on Friday night - just an hour before police say she jumped to her death from a city center building.

She was pronounced dead at the scene at 7.17pm, the New Jersey Record reported. No one else was injured.

Final moments: She posted this image of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death

Her
 father told the New York Post that she killed herself because she was 
overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn - changing her from the happy 
student she had been throughout high school.

'There
 was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' James Holleran tearfully told 
the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and 
stress.'

Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist.

'We
 knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost
 confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track 
abilities.'

On the day that 
she jumped to her death, her father texted her that morning encouraging 
her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she 
would.

But just hours later,
 she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family
 on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not 
detail the contents of the note.

Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents.

Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself.

'People talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News.

“This kid didn’t have a boyfriend. There were no drug issues. There were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last two, three weeks where they saw a change in her,' said Weckworth. 'Something snapped.'

'She got a 3.5 her first semester, and I think just the high expectations that she put on herself was that that’s just not acceptable.

'She was not happy at Penn, but the parents had told her then, ‘Don’t go back. We’ll transfer. We’ll look at other schools. There’s no reason to go back, it’s OK,’' he said.

Madison's funeral will be held today and her family have asked well-wishers to donate to 
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in lieu of flowers.

Holleran
 was a member of the university's varsity track and field team at UPenn.
 Her teammates were given the option of whether or not they wished to 
compete in Saturday's meet.

The school also canceled formal recruitment for sororities, in which Holleran was set to take part.

'The
 entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison 
Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement.

'She
 was bright and well-liked with an incredible future ahead of her. There
 are simply no words that can properly convey the sense of heartache 
that we all feel at such a tragic loss.'

'Our thoughts and prayers are with 
[Holleran's] family and friends,' said Steve Dolan, Penn's director of 
track and field, in a statement to the Daily Pennsylvanian.

Missed: The UPenn community was shaken by the death of Holleran, right, on Friday evening

'This is a challenging time 
for everyone involved with the program, but we will support each other 
in the weeks to come and help her teammates and friends find their own 
ways to honor her memory.'

Holleran,
 who was majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, had been a 
standout track and soccer athlete in her high school.

She originally planned to play soccer at Lehigh University before switching her mind, and choosing to run at Penn.

She had been named to the 
New Jersey Star-Ledger's all-state girls track team last year, while the Record 
named her its Spring Athlete of the Season and Girls Indoor Track Athlete of the Year in 2013, the Star Ledger reported.

Northern Highlands Girls Varsity Soccer, for which Holleran had played, tweeted: 'RIP
 Madison. You are our beloved NHGS sister forever and always. You have 
and always will be such a special person. We love you.'

A funeral for Holleran, who is one of five children, is expected to be held on Tuesday.
