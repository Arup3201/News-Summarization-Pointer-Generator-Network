A former University of Alabama basketball standout has been charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping for his alleged role in a bizarre plot to kidnap his own 6-year-old cousin earlier this year.

Also involved in the plot is 18-year-old Devonta Pollard's mother, 21-year-old cousin, aunt and uncle.

According to authorities, the family plotted to kidnap Jashayla Hopson, Pollard's cousin, in an effort to get the girl's mother - Pollard's aunt - Roshell Ford, to make a deal in a property dispute she had with Brown-Pollard.

Kemper County Sheriff James Moore told ABC News that the dispute is over a one-acre piece of land in Porterville, Mississippi, that once was owned by Brown-Pollard. When the house on the property burned down, Brown-Pollard lost the land and it was sold to Ford.

After the sale, Brown-Pollard allegedly conspired with a friend, 52-year-old Wanda Darcy, to kidnap the little girl in an attempt to coerce the girl's mother into giving her back the land.

"They began talking and Pollard told 
Dancy that she wanted to take Roshell Ford's daughter for 'leverage' to 
get her land back," FBI Special Agent Charles G. Murrow stated in his 
affidavit.

On April 30, Hopson was in her school library when Jessie Pollard picked her up and drove her to a motel. She allegedly then sent the girl's mother a text message that read, 'don't call the police I will call you 
later if you call the police u won't see her again.'

The number used to call Hopson's mother was traced to a Samsung phone bought at a Walmart in Bessemer, Alabama, on April 30. Surveillance footage from the Walmart shows Pollard purchasing the phone.

After the initial text message, Shaquayla Johnigan drove the girl to a motel in Laurel, Mississippi, where she sent Hopson's mother further instructions.

'since you called police, I want $50,000 by 3 p.m., I will tell you location later,' the text message read, according to the indictment.

That's when authorities began to suspect that Brown-Pollard was involved in the kidnapping - she was questioned by police and asked to take a polygraph.

Pollard allegedly then told his cousin Shaquayla Johnigan and her mother, 42-year-old Joyce Johnigan, that his mother was being questioned by police. So the pair drove the girl to a rural location in eastern Mississippi and dropped her off outside of a stranger's home.

Shaquayla Johnigan then drove the car she was driving into a ditch and threw the keys into a pond. Her father, 39-year-old James Johnigan, then burned the phone the plotters used to contact Hopson's mother.

About 1:25 p.m. on May 1, police found the girl at the stranger's home and returned her to her mother.

For their roles, the Johnigans and Pollard face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Pollard-Brown could face up to life in prison and a $750,000 fine.

Pollard has since been forced off of the University of Alabama's basketball team.
