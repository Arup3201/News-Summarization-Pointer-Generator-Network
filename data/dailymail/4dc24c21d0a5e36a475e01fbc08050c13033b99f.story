Last night, Adrian Chiles got to step on the turf in Switzerland to begin his European Qualifying campaign on ITV. This he did alongside the three men with whom he had spent so much time on the Copacabana Beach in Brazil.

Only now, Adrian and his crew of Glenn Hoddle, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon had stopped looking like four fellas at a stag weekend. And more like a quartet of ushers having a crafty fag outside the church before the bride turns up. 

And two of them, mind, in brown shoes with dark suits! Not naming names or anything, but shame on your Messrs Hoddle and Dixon!

However, this familiar line up’s take on Roy’s race for a qualifying slot was not necessarily the most interesting one on our boxes last night. That one was potentially over on Sky Sports. Where an overblown set that looked like University Challenge on steroids included the rather unique sight of the now internationally retired John Terry as a pundit.

A potential banana skin? Well, of course yes. Even if by the simple fact of his being there. I’m sure JT will, as ever, ‘divide opinion’. But don’t be fooled into thinking that it was only Sky Sports who might end being the victim of a discarded custard-coloured carcass. ITV also had some crazy moves last night. And one of them, our host DEFINITELY saw it coming.

Almost perfectly, as the pundits were setting up the game, you could see that Adrian had noticed out the corner of his eye that the pitch sprinklers were suddenly in full flow. 

And if there’s one thing Adrian enjoys even above telling ex-professionals about football (but wouldn’t we all?), it’s finding the funny thing.

Yet in spite of the temptation before him, he still managed to stay on topic. Even if he was twitching away as if on hot coals, so eager was he to talk about what was going on off piste. Which is clearly his schtick, and something he loves to do. And what’s more, he delivered. Because just as the sprinklers came around again, there was a soaking for everyone.

Adrian was in his element as the misty water showered down, and led into a break enthusing wildly about this slapstick moment. Short of a clown turning up pitchside in a collapsing car and slapping a custard pie in Lee Dixon’s face, this was clearly going to be his moment of the evening.

Meanwhile over on Sky Sports, host David Jones seemed to think he had a bucket of water all ready to pour over John Terry’s head.

Debut: John Terry was working as a pundit on television for the first time

Opinions: Terry made an appearance in the Sky Sports studio to talk about Monday's international action

They were all watching Spain’s game against Macedonia. In which Sergio Ramos scored a rather audacious penalty. ‘How about that from a centre half?’, asked Jones - bucket poised under the cold tap. 

Swivelling uncomfortably in his chair, and looking across to his co-pundit Jamie Redknapp for reassurance, the best JT could muster in response was ‘the less said the better’. Clearly, it was STILL not time to talk about missed penalties.

That phrase actually pretty much summed up John Terry’s international debut for Sky Sports. He always was has, and remains, the most stoic, no nonsense of centre halves. 

But if he intends to try and follow fellow defenders Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher into the broadcasting game, he’s going to have to learn a few more moves. 

The kind of mixture of media skills, hands on experience and steadfast opinion that his senior sidekick Jamie Redknapp has got nailed down, for me.

It was fascinating watching Jamie and JT working together. Questions would be thrown at Terry, to which he would respond in a surprisingly quiet voice. Nerves were clearly an issue, which, yes, is fair enough at this stage in his experience. But even so, he rarely strayed from the ‘footballer’s handy cliches’ manual.

So to help keep things moving, Jamie would pick up the thought, flesh it out with a bit of fact, and even, on occasion, turn it back into a question so that Terry could work with and pick up on.

That clearly helped Terry settle down and give us a little more insight into what his actual thoughts were. And in the end, he would be right in thinking that he probably just about got away with that one.

Although if he had been alongside Adrian and his box of tricks over on ITV, you may be right in thinking that would have been a different story!
