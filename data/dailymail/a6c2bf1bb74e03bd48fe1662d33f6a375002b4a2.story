A beetle that appears the whitest shade of white to the human eye has been examined by scientists.

Researchers say that the scales on the Cyphochilus beetle can scatter light better than any other animal or plant.

They believe its reflective coating could be copied to make brighter computer screens and paints as well as whiter paper.

The beetle has developed its extraordinary whiteness to blend in with the white mushrooms common in its native South-East Asia. 

Another species called Lepidiota Stigma has the same pigmentation. 

Animals use a rainbow of colours for camouflage, communication, mating and to control their temperature.

Pigments in their skin absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others - giving them a colour.

So to appear the whitest shade of white, the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally.

To appear the whitest shade of white, the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally. They do this using a specially-adapted internal structure (pictured) to make a reflective coating

The ultra-white Cyphochilus use the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule which is found everywhere from the shells of mussels to the structure of mushrooms – to reflect light. A magnified image of the Lepidiota Stigma beetle, which has the same pigmentation, is pictured

The Gaboon pit viper has ultra-black markings to help it blend into the forest floor.

Its black scales reflect less than 11 per cent of light, according to Nerdist, making it the 'blackest' of creatures.

The snake is also the heaviest viper with the largest venomous fangs.

But scientists have engineered a material that is blacker than the snake.

British Firm Surrey Nanosystems claims to have created the 'blackest' material last month.

Vantablack absorbs all but 0.04 per cent of light that hits it to give it its ultra-black appearance.

The material is made from nanotubes that are 10,000 times thinner than a human hair.

The tubes are packed so tightly together that entering light cannot pass through them and gets 'lost' inside them.

The material could be used by the military and the space industry.

The ultra-white Cyphochilus uses the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule that is found everywhere from shells  to  mushrooms – to do this.

Scientists at Cambridge University have shown that the beetles have optimised their internal structure to produce maximum ‘white’ with minimal material and effort.

Scientists likened them to a painter who needs to whiten a wall with a very small quantity of paint.

Lead researcher Dr Silvia Vignolini, of the University’s Cavendish Laboratory, said: ‘Current technology is not able to produce a coating as white as these beetles can in such a thin layer.

‘The lessons we are learning from these beetles is two-fold.

‘On one hand, we now know how to look to improve scattering strength of a given structure by varying its geometry.

‘On the other hand the use of strongly scattering materials, such as the particles commonly used for white paint, is not mandatory to achieve an ultra-white coating.’

Co-author on the study, Dr Matteo Burresi, of the Italian National Institute of Optics in Florence, said: ‘These scales have a structure that is truly complex since it gives rise to something that is more than the sum of its parts.’

In recent years, many engineers have been turning to nature to inspire ‘new’ types of structures.

Using technology perfected by the beetles, scientists hope to make paper, plastics and paints a brighter white.

They also believe that white-light reflectors inside computer and TV displays could also be made whiter and lighter, according to the study, which was published in the journal Scientific Report.
