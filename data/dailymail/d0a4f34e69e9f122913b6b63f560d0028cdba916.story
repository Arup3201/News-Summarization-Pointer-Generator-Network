A Tennessee man has pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and killing 20-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo who disappeared three years ago.

In the days following suspect Zachary Adams' arrest, authorities have been tight-lipped about evidence in the investigation, saying only that it is ongoing.

Adams appeared in a Decatur County courtroom Tuesday and was arraigned on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder.

Entering his plea: Adams was arrested on a separate aggravated assault charge before his March 5 indictment for the then-20-year-old's 2011 disappearance

Heartbreaking: Karen Bobo (seen with attorney Steve Farese) was in the court as Adams entered his plea, and she was seen wearing a pink bracelet since that is the last color she was seen wearing

Adams was shackled at the wrists and wore a black and gray striped shirt during the hearing, which lasted less than five minutes.

Relatives and friends of Bobo attended the hearing, including Holly's father Dana and mother Karen.

Both were seen wearing pink bracelet's in their daughter's honor, as that was the color she was last seen wearing.

Karen broke down in tears at the end of the Tuesday hearing.

Attorney
 Jennifer Lynn Thompson entered the plea on Adams' behalf. Circuit Court
 Judge Charles Creed McGinley asked Adams if he understood the charges, 
and Adams replied, 'Yes, sir.'

Attention in the case was revived about two weeks ago, when authorities searched property near Adams' home in the Holladay community, about 15 miles from Bobo's home.

Adams was arrested on a separate aggravated assault charge before his indictment March 5.

Before he was charged with Bobo's murder, Adams told The Jackson Sun 'I'm not the one.'

Adams has a list of prior charges in several West Tennessee jurisdictions, including driving without a license, disorderly conduct, probation violation, drug possession and assault.

Records show he served six months in jail for shooting his mother in the knee in 2004 with a handgun. In court documents in that case, his stepfather Joseph King said his family feared for their lives.

'He shot his mother point blank ... and is a danger to us and the community and our relatives,' King wrote.

Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn did not say during last week's news conference whether Adams knew Bobo.

Bobo's family said in a statement after the charges were announced that their faith will give them the strength to see them through the ordeal.

'In the recent days, it feels like everything has come against our hope and it seems that all our trust was shattered,' the statement said.

Questions: Police have still not revealed why they believe Adams is connected to Bobo's disappearance

Outside the courthouse, Memphis attorney Steve Farese said the Bobo family was doing as well as can be expected.

'It will help them if a conviction is had and the facts and circumstances are brought to light,' said Farese, who is representing the family.

Farese said he expects 'bits and pieces' of information to be released in coming weeks.

An April 9 status hearing has been set.

Nashville defense attorney David Raybin, a former prosecutor, said the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation must have had some sort of break in the case, given the recent flurry of activity, including multiple search warrants.

Mr Raybin said prosecutors may have decided to charge Adams because they didn't want the case to get any colder.

Standing strong: Holly's father Dana Bobo, also seen wearing a pink bracelet, was in court but like the rest of Holly's relatives, he did not issue any statements

'They may have concluded that they will never find a body and the case is not going to get any stronger,' Mr Raybin said.

'Witnesses die and evidence evaporates. It could be that it was now or never.'

Residents in the town of Parsons, near where Bobo disappeared in West Tennessee, are looking for closure.

'There's a lot of unanswered questions,' said Ronda Philpott, who attended the school where Bobo's mother taught.

'At this point in time, it's believed that Holly's deceased and the most important thing now is for her poor family to have some peace.'

Prosecutors are considering asking for the death penalty if they get a conviction.

Adams is the only suspect named by authorities since Bobo disappeared on the morning of April 13, 2011, outside her home near Parsons, about 120 miles northeast of Memphis.

Her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, local law enforcement and privately-hired search teams have looked for Bobo over the years.

Relatives and friends held out hope that Bobo would be found alive like Elizabeth Smart, who was kidnapped and held captive for nine months when she was 14 in Utah. Smart even spoke at Bobo's high school in August 2012.

As searchers scoured thick woods, old barns and open fields, townspeople adorned light poles, mailboxes and storefronts with pink bows because Bobo was last seen wearing a pink shirt and carrying a pink purse.
