Dramatic footage has emerged showing terrified passengers hurling themselves from a sinking tourist dive boat off the coast of Thailand.

As the ship - named the Aladdin - goes down in just minutes, people can be heard screaming and shouting for help as they realise that they are in grave danger.

Some of the passengers who jumped off the boat were sucked under the waves as they tried to escape. Others were able to dive to safety.

Dramatic rescue: Passengers dived from the sinking dive boat as it went down off the coast of Thailand

 

Miraculously none of the 13 people on board died after people on another boat swam over to save them.

Swedish diver Dennis Karlsson, 46, who was on board the Peter Pan, took the footage of the boat sinking and the dramatic rescue.

‘It was just a coincidence that our boat was there and could come to the rescue,’ he told Sweden's  Aftonbladet newspaper.

‘It was really, really serious. It took on a lot of water.

‘People threw themselves headlong into the water. Some were sucked under the water with the boat before they resurfaced and were pulled out. It was really amazing that everyone survived.’

It is believed that Aladdin, which sank between Bon Island and Tachai Island in Thailand's south, was on a four-day live-aboard adventure trip at the time it sank.

The incident comes just three months after six tourists died when an overcrowded ferry capsized and sank off the Thai coast.

The double-decker ferry, which was carrying around 200 people, had an engine problem which caused the ferry to flip on its side and sink in November.

Among the dead were Three Thais – two women and a man – a Russian man, a Russian woman and a Chinese man.

The ferry which was carrying around 200 people, well over its capacity of 130 to 150 passengers, did not have enough life vests for those on board.
