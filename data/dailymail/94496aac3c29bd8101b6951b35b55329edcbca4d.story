Couples should be able to get a divorce simply by signing a form at the register office, the country’s most senior family law judge said yesterday.

Sir James Munby also backed fault-free divorce, which would mean neither party would have to take legal blame for the breakdown of a marriage.

In a radical package of reforms to the laws on divorce and relationships, he said consenting couples should no longer need the approval of a judge to end their marriage.

Couple wanting to end their marriage should be able to divorce at a registry office, according to Sir James Munby

Instead their break-up should simply be recorded by a registrar in the same way as births, marriages and deaths.

And he said the grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour should disappear from the statute book.

In
 a speech to fellow judges he said: ‘Has the time not come to legislate 
to remove all concepts of fault as a basis for divorce and to leave 
irretrievable breakdown as the sole ground?’

Sir
 James, who as President of the Family Division is the head of the 
courts that deal with family break-ups and custody of children, also 
called for a cohabitation law to protect women who face ‘the scrapheap’ 
after parting with a man they have lived with for years but never 
married.

Such a law would 
see live-in couples treated as married people in the eyes of the law 
once they have shared a home for a set period of time.

Government
 advisers have already suggested a live-in couple should be bound by law
 after two years if they have  children and five if they do not. But 
critics said the proposed divorce and cohabitation laws would be open to
 abuse and hard to operate.

Sir James also backed fault-free divorce, which would mean that no husband or wife would have to take legal blame for destroying their marriage

After
 his speech, Sir James told journalists: ‘There are countries where the 
system is that a divorce which is by consent and where there are no 
children is treated as an administrative matter dealt with by what, 
using our terminology, one might describe as the registrar of births, 
deaths, marriages and divorces. It seems to work.’

He
 said he ‘would not contemplate it in cases other than cases where there
 is consent and cases where there are no children of the family’.

Sir
 James said the process of deciding where the children of separated 
parents should live has already been ‘uncoupled’ from divorce, and he 
hoped the system for dividing up goods and setting maintenance payments 
could be similarly detached from the legal declaration of the divorce 
itself.

Current divorce law dates from 1969, when liberal reforms introduced elements of a no-fault system, but said couples must wait for a divorce on grounds of separation alone

He acknowledged that
 he has not discussed his plans with ministers, but said his proposals 
‘would make divorce no easier than it is at present’.

He
 added: ‘All one is doing is actually bringing a bit of intellectual 
honesty to the situation and getting rid of an unnecessary process which
 simply makes life more complicated.’

Any
 changes to divorce law would need parliamentary  legislation to be 
drawn up and pushed through by the Justice Secretary. Ministers have  
indicated that present Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will not 
consider divorce reform before the election.

Yesterday, lawyers and family researchers warned that Sir James’s proposals are fraught with risk and difficulty.

Patricia
 Morgan, author of a study on the collapse of marriage, The Marriage 
Files, to be published shortly, said: ‘It would be the end, the 
demolition, the abolition of marriage.

‘These ideas would mean an end to any declaration of public commitment by a couple.

‘They
 would open the door to the monster state, which would arrange your 
affairs and divide your money whether you like it or not.’
