Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling will go head-to-head tonight over the future of Scotland in a crunch debate set to be dominated by the pound, oil reserves and the ‘Tory threat’ to the NHS.

Mr Salmond is expected to raise the risks of not choosing independence – including the prospect of leaving the EU and a future Conservative government slashing health and benefit spending.

The clash, live on the BBC tonight from 8.30pm, is the pair’s second television debate and is being seen as Mr Salmond’s ‘last opportunity’ to convince Scots to back independence. More than 700,000 postal voters – nearly a fifth of Scotland's electorate – will receive their ballots on Tuesday.

A recent poll of polls found 57 per cent of Scots will vote No to independence on September 18, while 43 per cent plan to vote Yes.

The leaders' first live debate on August 5 was widely seen as a victory for Mr Darling, after the former Chancellor cornering the SNP leader over Scotland’s future currency.

Tonight’s 90-minute event will be staged at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow in front of an audience of 200 people selected by polling and research consultancy ComRes.

Prof John Curtice of Stratchlyde University wrote in the Sunday Times: 'With the Yes side still behind in the polls and postal voting forms about to land on doormats, the encounter will be [Mr Salmond's] last opportunity to get his message across to a mass audience.'

Mr Salmond has been under sustained pressure to reveal his ‘Plan B’ after his preferred option of keeping the pound in a currency union with the remainder of the UK was ruled out by all the main UK parties.

The First Minister has dismissed this as pre-referendum posturing, and insisted Scotland will keep the pound ‘come what may’. 

But tonight Mr Salmond is expected to go on the attack over the threats to Scotland’s public services by staying in the UK and running the risk of English voters forcing a Tory government on the rest of the country.

The ‘yes’ to independence campaign wants to convince voters that only independence can protect Scotland from further austerity and privatisation.

In an interview in the Guardian, Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘If we don't [vote yes] then a few months after the referendum we may find ourselves waking up to another five years of a Conservative government that we didn't vote for.

She said the next Tory government would be ‘intent on implementing further cuts and austerity that will hit our public services and hit the most vulnerable in our society’.

She added that Scotland would also be ‘looking at the prospect of an in/out EU referendum that runs the risk of Scotland being taken out of the European Union against our will’.

‘The key thing if we don't vote yes is that all these key decisions that shape our future will be taken not by us but by Westminster as we are left on the sidelines complaining and wishing it were different.’

Mr Darling was first to accept the 'ice bucket challenge' after he was nominated alongside Mr Salmond by actor James McAvoy

Last week the Scottish government's health secretary Alex Neil accused Mr Darling of being ‘defender-in-chief of Tory cuts’.

But a Better Together spokesman said: ‘The biggest threat to our public services in Scotland, like our schools and our NHS, is the £6 billion extra spending cuts the impartial experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say would be needed if we vote for separation. The reality is that independence would mean austerity plus.’

Gordon Brown last week unveiled new research showing that each Scot currently receives £200 more in health care spending a year than the average Englishman.

‘The only person who could privatise the NHS in Scotland today is actually Alex Salmond,’ the former Labour leader told party activists during a speech in Glasgow.

Last year Scottish health care spending was the equivalent of £2,116 per person – far higher than the £1,912 in England and £1,964 in Wales, figures showed.

Furthermore, Scotland in total receives around £950 million more towards health care than it would if the allocation was worked out by population share.
