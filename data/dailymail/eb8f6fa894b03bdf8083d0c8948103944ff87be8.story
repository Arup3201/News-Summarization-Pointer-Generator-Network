The world's oldest marathon runner ran his last race on Sunday at the age of 101.

Fauja Singh finished the Hong Kong marathon's 10km (6.25 mile) race in a time of one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds.

Mr Singh, a Sikh, completed the race accompanied by runners from Hong Kong's Sikh community, joining about 72,000 other runners taking part in the marathon.

The Indian-born runner, nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo, had said that he would hang up his trainers after the race in the southern Chinese city, just before his 102nd birthday.

'I will remember this day. I will miss it,' Mr Singh said minutes after crossing the finish line.

Mr Singh, a great-grandfather, became the oldest man to run a full marathon at Toronto in 2011, at the age of 100.

But his record was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he doesn't have a birth certificate to prove his age.

Mr Singh has a British passport that shows his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials states that birth records were not kept in 1911.

'I am feeling a bit of happiness and a bit of sadness mixed together. I am happy that I am retiring at the top of the game but I am sad that the time has come for me to not be part of it,' Mr Singh said in a pre-race interview.

Running has taken Fauja Singh all over the world, including Frankfurt, Germany (left) and Mumbai, India (right)

'And there will always be times in the future where I will be thinking, "Well, I used to do that"', the Punjabi-speaking Singh said through his coach and interpreter, Harmander Singh.

Mr Singh took up running as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India.

The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on Mr Singh because of its grisly nature. Mr Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father's eyes.

Mr Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left alone.

'He didn't think his life was worth living without his son,' coach Harmander Singh said.

He went to live with his youngest son in London and attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community including sprinting events.

He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided he would try it out.

In 2000, at the age of 89, he ran the London marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto marathon.

'From a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,' Mr Singh said before the race as he explained how running has changed his life, allowing an illiterate farmer to travel the world, meet dignitaries and stay in five-star hotels.

Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped 'people will remember me and not forget me.' He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events 'rather than forget me altogether just because I don't run anymore.'
