No student wants to look shaggy-haired and dog-tired in their yearbook photo.

But Taxi Benke has a good excuse - he's a half-labrador, half-golden retriever service dog.

The faithful companion was rewarded for his loyalty by a middle school in San Antonio, Texas, after looking after an epileptic seventh-grader for four years.

Spot the dog: Taxi was rewarded for looking after epileptic Rachel Benke - with a photo in her yearbook

Companion: The dog goes everywhere with Rachel, her mother told Texas news channel KENS5

It is not known which quote he gave for the yearbook - and what people will think of his hairstyle at the 20th reunion is anyone's guess.

But for epilepsy sufferer Rachel Benke, the decision by the Northside Independent School District proved Taxi had entered everyone's hearts.

It was a long road for the pet - a 'dropout' who did not make the guide dog program because he was too fond of attacking cats.

Her mother Theresa told KENS5 Rachel had epileptic seizures from birth and her life was turned around after meeting Taxi four years ago.

He now accompanies her everywhere, including at award presentations and birthday parties.

'We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel was terrified of animals,' she said.

Saviour: On one school sports day Taxi became anxious immediately before Rachel had a seizure

'Next thing you know Rachel bent down and just hugged him, and it's the cutest thing you've ever seen.'

On one school sports day, Taxi became agitated and rushed towards the schoolgirl minutes before she had a seizure.

'He started pulling away from the aide as far as he could trying to get to Rachel,' she said. 'We don't know how he knew this, but he wouldn't let anyone near Rachel until the paramedics got there.'

Taxi, however, does not take the prize for the most bizarre yearbook photo incident of 2014.

Last week a high school in Utah secretly Photoshopped more clothes onto several of its students because it deemed them too sexy.

The shocked girls only discovered after the yearbook was printed that many of them appeared to be wearing a different outfit.

Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker defended the decision - claiming students know the dress code and there was a sign warning them their pictures may be altered.
