They have not seen each other in three years, but Courtney Love insists she is on good terms with daughter.

The Hole singer, 48, is slowly rebuilding her relationship with daughter Frances Bean - whose father is late grunge star Kurt Cobain - although the only have contact over the internet.

In an interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show, she said: 'I'm really good with my daughter now - we're emailing and tweeting.'

She added that she thinks her 
20-year-old daughter's team of lawyers and assistants were primarily 
responsible for the 'extreme' restraining order Frances got against her 
in December of 2009.

Adding to the complexity of their 
relationship, Courtney said that she hasn't met her daughter's fiance 
Isaiah Silva, but has talked to him online.

She said that he seems 'really, really nice.'

Respecting her Frances' need for 
discretion, she said: 'I don't want to get too into her [Frances'] 
private stuff... she's really private.'

The rocker also commented on last month's controversy regarding claims Nirvana rocker Dave Grohl, 44, tried to hit on Frances.

She said that she heard from 'an 
impeccable source' that the Foo Fighters frontman 'was saying things 
that were inappropriate' about her daughter.

Courtney said she apologized 'because it was all public, but the reality is, Dave did say these dirty things.'

She also claimed Frances had been 
offered the role of Bella in the Twilight film franchise - which 
eventually went to Kristen Stewart - when she was 13, but didn't take it
because it was a 'sexist Mormon piece of s**t.'

Courtney is also working on a new album and already has two tracks ready to release and a title.

Speaking in another interview she 
said: 'I'm thinking of maybe naming my f***ing album "Died Blonde", 
because I'm in such a morbid space.

'It's not that I'm unhappy. And it's 
certainly not that I'm crazy. It's just that I know all this s**t, and I
don't know what to do with it.'

Though they lead separate lives, both Courtney and her daughter have recently been involved in Twitter battles.

Frances Bean labelled Kendall Jenner a
'f**king idiot' while Courtney has responded to Amanda Bynes' countless
outrageous tweets with: 'Amanda Bynes pull it together dude.'
