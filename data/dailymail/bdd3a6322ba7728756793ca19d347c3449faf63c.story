Princess Beatrice tried her hand at investment banking in London today.

The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson joined a slew of celebrities as she brokered deals on the phone for charity.

Beatrice, 26, returned to the annual BGC Charity Day selling shares for a good cause, while commemorating the bank's employees who perished on 9/11.

Every September 11 since 2005 the bank, together with Cantor Fitzgerald, distribute 100 per cent of revenue to the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund and multiple charities around the world.

And they always invite a hoard of A-listers to help them out. 

While the celebrities choose their own charities, the initiative is held in memory of hundreds of staff of its sister company, investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, who had offices at the top of the North Tower. 

Beatrice joined her mother and sister Eugenie at the event in 2011 at the same London office in Canary Wharf.

But today she came alone, joining the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Dynamo, Stephen Fry and Jack Whitehall, as each celebrity raised money for their chosen charity.

David Gandy, Yasmin Le Bon, Clive Owen, Amanda Holden and James Haskell also gave brokering a go for a good cause.

In addition to giving money to charity, the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund also accepts donations from the general public. 

Since its inception, Charity Day has raised approximately £62 million ($101 million) globally. 

Each anniversary is a poignant occasion and the Charity Day is the bank's way of turning a tragic day into one that is positive and uplifting, by helping others.
