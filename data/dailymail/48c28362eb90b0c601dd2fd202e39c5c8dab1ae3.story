Halloween arrived early in a French city today as  zombies took over streets for an annual zombie walk.

Fully grown adults lapped on fake blood and talcum powder before marching through the city of Strasbourg in Eastern France for the fourth zombie walk in the city.

The march signals the opening of the European Fantastic Film Festival, which presents horror, fantasy, science fiction, thriller and animation movies, until September 22.

The Candice Mack School of Professional Make-Up zombified people and turned them into the living dead

Disgusting! The incredible make-up unfortunately looks good enough to be real

Students from the Candice Mack School of
Professional Make-Up put on a free session before the march allowing 
people to 'zombifiy' themselves.

The zombies began pacing the streets of Strasbourg from Place Brogile, this afternoon, to the music of Fanfare d’Outre-Tombe.

The hour long walk is followed by a zombie disco with DJ sets from Panimix, No Stress and Dr Phibes.

The world record for the biggest ever
zombie walk is thought to stand at almost 10,000, set by a huge hoard 
of the undead in Mexico City last year.

Keep the kids at home: Some of the zombies really were terrifying

Playtime: Girls with blood smeared down their faces take pleasure in scaring onlookers

9,860 registered participants were dressed in rags and ghoulish makeup to look bloody and decaying, more than doubling a record set in New Jersey in 2010.

While Strasborg's parade may not be on quite the same scale, it is certainly one of the biggest in Europe.
