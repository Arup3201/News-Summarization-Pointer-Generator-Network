Goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta ensured Manchester City beat Roma and sealed progression to the knockout stages of this season's Champions League.

Results were in their favour on Wednesday night and, along with Chelsea and Arsenal, they are in the pot for the last 16 draw.

Here, Sportsmail looks at City's group stage story, and how they came back from the brink... 

BAYERN MUNICH 1-0 MAN CITY

September 17

City get off to the worst possible start after Jerome Boateng’s last-gasp winner in Munich. To top it off, Roma have beaten CSKA Moscow 5-1, and things look bleak for Manuel Pellegrini's men.

Joe Hart rocks back on his heels in the post-match interview, after a man-of-the-match performance. City are still confident despite two poor results on the opening night, he says.

MAN CITY 1-1 ROMA

September 30

Sergio Aguero gives City the lead from the penalty spot, but a record-breaking Francesco Totti goal rescues a point for Roma.

If City are to progress, these are the games they need to win. At home to their main rivals for the second qualification spot. The Etihad crowd seem to have given up hope too - the attendance is 10,000 under capacity.

Sportsmail's Martin Samuel summed up the performance:

'Roma probably shaded it here, and certainly Joe Hart was the busier goalkeeper. The hero in defeat against Bayern Munich, he saved City once again, and was unfortunate that a slip at a vital moment prevented him closing out what proved to be the equaliser.'

The visitors coast to a 2-0 half-time lead but throw away a vital victory. Sergio Aguero and James Milner are on the scoresheet as the first 45 minutes end, and things are looking rosy from a City perspective. Yes, they had one point from their first two matches, but a positive away win will do them the world of good.

A disastrous second-half performance follows though, as Seydou Doumbia and Bebras Natcho steal a point for the Russians. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman reports from the game:

'Freezing temperatures, a stadium echoing to the boorish, boozed-up chanting of CSKA fans who shouldn’t have been anywhere near the place and a late penalty decision so dreadful it’s tempting to check the Hungarian referee’s passport for Russian lineage.'  It wasn't City's night.

Things go from bad to worse for City. Four games, two points. Both Fernandinho and Yaya Toure see red, and a double from Seydou Doumbia secures an unlikely away win for the Russian side.

Sportsmail's Martin Samuel was at the game:

'Even by the dismal standards of Manchester City in the Champions League this was a low. Defeat at home to what had been considered the weakest team in Group E, reduced to nine players by the end, never ahead at any stage of the match, trailing after two minutes, Toure banned for the rest of the campaign, this was close to as bad as it gets.'

November 25

The turning point for City. Bayern Munich will progress as group winners, and City's chances of taking second spot in the group are given a huge boost with a miraculous three points at the Etihad. Sergio Aguero, take a bow. The Argentinian scores a hat-trick, and City aren't down and out just yet.

'Sometimes, it doesn’t have to make sense, you know,' Martin Samuel said from the Etihad. 'It just is what it is. By some miracle of mathematics and against all logic, Manchester City are still in Europe.'

They've done it. Manchester City, along with Arsenal and Chelsea, are through to the knockout stages of the Champions League.

They made hard work of it, but eventually goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta takes them through to the stage that looked so unlikely just two games ago. It started badly in September, but finished with a flourish on Wednesday. 

Martin Samuel watched the game unfold live in Rome: 

'They were men down here, and good men, too — Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany, David Silva until midway through the second half. Yet they came through. They won, CSKA Moscow lost and a place in Monday’s last-16 draw was theirs.'
