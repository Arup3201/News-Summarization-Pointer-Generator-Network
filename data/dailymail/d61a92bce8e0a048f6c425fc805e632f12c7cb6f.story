Wandering barefoot across a sun-kissed beach, David Cameron looks like he does not have a care in the world.

But while the Prime Minister enjoys his second foreign holiday of the year, a shocking new humanitarian crisis has been unfolding in Iraq.

Mr Cameron flew into Portugal for a 10-day family break on Saturday, August 2.

Chilling out: The day after the Islamic State militant group overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq, David Cameron was photographed strolling along the white sands of a popular Portuguese beach

Hours later the feared Islamic State militant group overran the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq and drove up to 150,000 terrified members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes.

The scale of the disaster emerged last Tuesday, when human rights groups revealed that tens of thousands of fleeing civilians, many of them children, were trapped on a barren mountainside with dwindling food and water supplies.

The next day, Mr Cameron was photographed strolling along the white sands of a popular Portuguese beach.

Wearing sunglasses and his trademark blue polo shirt as he carried his trainers in one hand, he appeared tanned and relaxed.

Planned: And RAF aircraft flew Mr Cameron to Belgium, where he took part in First World War anniversary commemorations with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

At one point he balanced his sunglasses on the top of his head and gave a thumbs up to a passer-by.

The Prime Minister did interrupt the start of his holiday in the seaside town of Cascais – but only for long-planned official events rather than to deal with the bloody crises in Iraq, Gaza and Ukraine.

An RAF aircraft flew him back to Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony on August 3 and then on to France and Belgium for First World War anniversary commemorations.

He returned to Portugal on a commercial flight at his own expense to rejoin his family.

Mr Cameron, who also had a break in Lanzarote at Easter, will return to Downing Street in the middle of this week.

But he and his wife will then leave Number 10 again later this summer for their traditional holiday in Cornwall  with their children Nancy, eight, Arthur, six, and Florence, 23 months.

Time for tee: U.S. President Barack Obama has also faced criticism for flying off for his summer holiday, where he was pictured enjoying a round of golf with former American football player Ahmad Rashad

U.S. President Barack Obama has also faced criticism for flying off for his summer holiday on Saturday, just days after authorising American airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq.

He, his family and their two dogs are staying in a rented house on the island of Martha’s Vineyard, off the coast of Massachusetts.

Mr Obama wasted no time on the first day of his two-week break before heading to the Farm Neck Golf Club for a round with a basketball star and a former American football player.

The White House has been at pains to stress that the president remains in close contact with his advisers while he is away, and he will return to Washington for two days during his holiday.

Mr Obama phoned German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the situation in Ukraine while he was flying to Massachusetts on the presidential jet Air Force One.

French president Francois Hollande, whose country is helping the aid mission to help the Yazidi refugees, is also currently away on his summer vacation.

But France’s foreign minister Laurent Fabius flew into Iraq yesterday to oversee the delivery of humanitarian supplies.
