When a painter and decorator scooped £7million in the lottery, he thought all of his prayers had been answered. 

But like many millionaires before him, Willie Sibbald learned the hard way that money can't buy everything, after being turned away from a pub where he was already banned for  drunken behaviour.

The 48-year-old from Newington, Edinburgh, was eager to celebrate his windfall after handing in his notice last week. 

Willie Sibbald was celebrating his £7million win when he was turned away from The Grapes pub in Edinburgh 

Mr Sibbald, who had vowed to split his winnings with his best friend, Rab Layden, went to the pub on Friday night.

But the millionaire wasn't able to enjoy a single drink, after staff refused him service.

Gordon Turnball, manager at the pub, said: 'I wasn't working but I heard from staff he popped his head in to say hello to his mates. 

'He'd had a fair bit to drink already and he knew not to get served.

'He misbehaved in the past but he's never been violent or anything like that. The Grapes isn't a regular haunt of his, he comes in from time to time. 

The 47-year-old had already been drinking when he went to the pub last weekend. He is pictured celebrating receiving his cheque 

Staff at The Grapes said Mr Sibbald was not a regular customer but had been refused service in the past 

'I'd happily let him in and serve him if he behaved properly just like anyone else.' 

After collecting his cheque for £7,084,472 on August 12, Mr Sibbald said he would split the money with his best friend to 'see him right'. 

The pair had been buying two tickets each every week for years. 

'We used to say "Imagine it was us, what would you do?" But you never expect it,' he said.

'It's one of those things you say. You're sitting there eating your piece and you'd say "Rab, imagine if we won this, you'd never need to work again." But you never really think it's going to happen.'

The football fans are now looking forward to following the Tartan Army to away games across the world. 

Mr Layden, 57, was painting a kitchen when he was told he'd never have to work again. 

'He phoned me at 1.45pm and said "By the way I've got something to tell you, are you sitting down? I'm the guy that won the lottery" - and I about collapsed.

'I then met him at the yard and told the bosses at 2.40pm and retired five minutes later. Then we went for a pint.'

'The trust and the loyalty is there, there was never any doubt about it. Truth and honesty always comes to the fore.' 

Speaking of his plans for the future, Mr Sibbald said he wanted to buy a Rolls Royce. 

'It's been such a whirlwind I've not had time to really think about what I will do with the money but I will probably learn to drive and get myself a car,' he said.
