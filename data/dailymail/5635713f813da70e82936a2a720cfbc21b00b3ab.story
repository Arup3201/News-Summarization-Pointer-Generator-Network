Brits are among the worst deal hunters in Europe, according to new research.

UK holidaymakers don’t even make the top 10 when it comes to looking for value-for-money trips, with just two fifths searching for seasonal deals prior to booking an escape.

Data compiled by travel firm Expedia indicates it is the Asian nations and Mexicans who are leading the deal-hunting pack.

Brits abroad: But UK holidaymakers are missing out on the best offers to Asian and Latin America deal hunters

Just 43 per cent of Brits look for flight deals, in comparison to 49 per cent in Spain, 45 per cent in Austria, 53 per cent in Norway, 47 per cent in Denmark, 65 per cent in Ireland and 44 per cent in Italy.

Similarly, when booking all inclusive hotels with meal plans, only 30 per cent of Brits do, compared to 38 per cent of Germans, 41 per cent of Italians, 32 per cent of French, 37 per cent of Spaniards and 40 per cent of Austrians.

On the plus side, this means Brits have a host of money saving options to wise up to in the future.

They can take advantage of discounts by booking through mobile as only a measley six per cent currently do this.

Big drinkers: Brits dedicate a greater percentage of their holiday budget to booze than any other nation

And they could be much savier by subscribing for newsletters offering exclusive deals.

Only 40 per cent look for deals by booking flights and hotel together and just 22 per cent purchase tickets to attractions in advance, risking over-priced offers and loss of valuable time on holiday.

Many also book hotels without complimentary Wi-Fi which often adds an unnecessary cost when they are away.

Expedia.co.uk Managing Director Andy Washington commented: ‘With rapidly changing prices, finding the best deal can be a complex process and this study shows that Brits aren’t always sure how to go about this.'

But there is one area Brits flourish – in the booze department.

We dedicate a greater percentage of the holiday budget to booze than any other nation.
