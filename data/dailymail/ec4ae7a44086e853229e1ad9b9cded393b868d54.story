Headteacher Morian Morgan has written to parents following concerns that children as young as six are re-enacting scenes from Grand Theft Auto

Children as young as six are re-enacting brutal and sexually explicit scenes from Grand Theft Auto, a headmaster has warned.

They are playing games involving ‘simulating rape and sexual intercourse’ and having playground chats about drugs and prostitution.

Primary school youngsters are also using the ‘strongest of sexual swear words’ and discussing sex acts as a result of exposure to the controversial 18-rated computer game.

Morian Morgan, head of Coed-y-Brain Primary in the village of Llanbradach, South Wales, said some pupils even injure themselves after copying aggressive scenes.

In the latest Grand Theft Auto game, players must choose various torture methods to use on a victim, such as pulling out teeth with pliers, electrocution, beating with a heavy wrench or water-boarding.

Mr Morgan, 57, has fired off a warning letter to parents about pupils’ ‘extremely concerning behaviour’, which he blames on their ‘first-hand experience of video games totally inappropriate to their age’. 

He said: ‘One game in particular causes me concern more than any other and this is Grand Theft Auto.’

Mr Morgan provided a detailed description of it – highlighting violent sex scenes and drug use. He urged parents to ensure their child has ‘no contact with this or any other age-inappropriate games’.The father of two added that if pupils continue to be exposed to them, he may have to ‘instigate child protection procedures’.

Horrified teachers had asked children what games they were playing at break and lunch time. The pupils, aged six to 11, told them they had been watching Grand Theft Auto V – the newest release, in which three criminals plot their chances of ‘survival and success’ in a fictional American city called Los Santos.

SCROLL DOWN FOR LETTER IN FULL

Mr Morgan has insisted the letter was simply a way of making parents aware of this trend, rather than criticising them

In a particularly harrowing scene, 
players must select a torture instrument to use on a man believed to be 
harbouring terrorist secrets.

The
 game also features an explicit sex scene involving a ‘psycho slut’ in a
 back garden, spied on by a third character who takes photographs.

Grand
 Theft Auto V is believed to be one of the best-selling games of all 
time, with more than 32.5million copies distributed worldwide.

Mr
 Morgan, who has been headmaster for 12 years, told a local paper: ‘It 
became more concerning because this newest version seems to be even more
 shocking than the previous games.’

He said some parents had destroyed their copies of Grand Theft Auto after receiving his letter.

Staff at the school approached some of the children to ask them where they had seen some of the behaviour. Pictured is an image taken from the game

The letter sent to parents said children were 'acting out scenes from the game which include the strongest of sexual swear words', 'having conversations' about sexual acts and 'play acting extremely violent games that sometimes result in actual injury'

Caerphilly Council said it was an internal matter for the school.Primary
 school pupils as young as six are re-enacting drug and rape scenes from
 Grand Theft Auto in the playground, a headteacher has warned.

Young
 children have been initiating games involving 'simulating rape and 
sexual intercourse' as well as having playground chats about 'drug use',
 according to Coed-y-Brain Primary School head Morian Morgan.

Speaking
 to the South Wales Argus, Mr Morgan insisted the letter was simply a 
way of making parents aware of this trend, rather than criticising them.

Mr
 Morgan said: 'I sent out the letter with some trepidation but I’m 
pleased I sent it because all the comments, as far as I’m aware, have 
been very supportive.

'Until
 I went online and checked the content of this game, I thought it was 
just a bit of swearing and some shooting and I think some of the parents
 will tell you that they have been equally naive.

'But I must stress it’s not a matter of me condemning parents at all.'

Staff at the school approached some of the children to ask them where they had seen some of the behaviour.

Mr
 Morgan said: 'We noticed it building up. It used to be when people 
watched TV programmes, we probably did it ourselves with cowboys and 
Indians.

'It became more concerning because this newest version of GTA seems to be even more shocking than the previous games.

'The
 youngest child showing this kind of behaviour was a six-year-old but 
that is unusual. It was very much a minority re-enacting these acts.'

Dear Parent/Carer.

I have recently encountered some extremely concerning behaviour including the use of very bad language by children (some as young as 6 years old).

Investigation of these incident has usually led to the same place: the children involved had first hand experience of video games totally inappropriate to their age. There are a number of games involved but the common factor is that they are clearly labelled with age certificates of 16 or 18.

One game in particular causes me concern more than any other and this is Grand Theft Auto.Exposure to the game has resulted the following:

Many of you may be unaware of the content of this game - until recently I was.

With this in mind I have included a product description of Grand Theft Auto at the end of this letter.I am sure, that now you are aware of the shocking content of this game, you will ensure that your child will have no contact with this or any other age inappropriate games.

I am sure you will appreciate that behaviour of the kind described above cannot be tolerated within our school and I am sure that none of us would want our children exposed to it.

I appreciate that sometimes exposure to these games may happen without parents' knowledge; children may play games at friends' homes or with older family members. May I ask you to be alert to this possibility.

As a school we have a duty of care to all our children. Should I become aware that pupils continue to be exposed to these games, I will contact individual parents and ultimately may have to instigate child protection procedures.

Yours sincerely

M. Morgan,

Headteacher
