Devotees of Radio 4’s The Archers have complained racy plots are reducing the soap to ‘EastEnders in a field’.

Now, the head of the BBC, Tony Hall, has signalled a move to take the show back to its roots. His pledge to ensure ‘we don’t lose what is precious’ will come as a relief to listeners disillusioned with the long-running drama.

Turnaround: Head of the BBC Tony Hall has signalled a move to take the show back to its roots

Lord Hall was asked in an interview about fans wanting the programme to ‘go back to being The Archers again – not EastEnders in a field’.

He told Radio Times: ‘It is an extraordinary drama … I live with some Archers devotees. 

'I know how people feel about [it] and I hope Gwyneth [Williams, Radio 4 Controller] and the team will be thinking about what is happening and making sure that we don’t lose what is precious.’

The turnaround comes after years of the BBC being accused of ‘sexing up’ the show. Fans have been in revolt over ‘weird storylines and soapy plots’, Lord Hall was told.

Ratings rose under editor Vanessa Whitburn, who left in May 2013, but during her tenure, The Archers was transformed from a sedate tale of rural life to a serial of sensational storylines, including an arson attack and a torrid extra-marital affair.

In 2011, she was criticised for killing off Nigel Pargetter, a character for almost 30 years. One fan said: ‘Are you trying to compete with soaps like EastEnders?’
