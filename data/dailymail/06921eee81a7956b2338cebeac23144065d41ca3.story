Incredible stories of bravery have emerged today after a devastating two-mile wide tornado decimated a small Oklahoma town, leaving at least 24 people dead including nine children.

One heroic teacher who shielded students with her body from the ferocious winds said on Tuesday that one terrified child had cried: 'I love you, I love you, please don't die with me' as the building came down on top of them.

Rhonda Crosswhite hurried her fourth-grade students into bathroom stalls at Plaza Towers Elementary in Moore, Oklahoma on Monday afternoon at 3pm (CST) as the giant twister bore down.

Seven children have been confirmed dead by the medical examiner's office after they drowned when water mains burst. No survivors have been found today and officials said they hope to complete three searches of every site of devastation before nightfall.

Rescuers brought in cadaver dogs on Tuesday afternoon as hopes faded of finding anyone else alive.

The family of nine-year-old Janae Hornsby confirmed to KOCO that she had been killed at Plaza Towers school when the tornado struck.

Among the
 missing who have been named are third-grader Kyle Davis and student Sydney 
Angle.

One tearful rescuer said how he had 
helped pull a car out of the school's front hallway, revealing another 
teacher with three little kids underneath her. He broke down as he 
added: 'Good job, teach.'

Miss Crosswhite told the Today
 show on Tuesday of the sheer terror of the little children as they 
huddled together in bathroom stalls while the building crumbled on top 
of them.

She said: 
'One of my little boys just kept saying, ''I love you, I love you, 
please don't die with me, please don't die with me.'' And when it 
finally stopped, we made it out.'

The
 teacher said that a father of one pupil along with one of her students 
Antonio helped pull every one to safety. She said that all of her 
students had survived and were fine apart from one child who suffered a 
head injury.

Hero: Rhonda Crosswhite and Hayden Young both described their heartbreak
 after their little school of 500 students was wiped out by the tornado

Miss Crosswhite was reunited with 
fourth-grader Damien Kline whom she held in a tight hug as his mother 
looked on in tears. The boy said that his teacher saved his life by 
covering them in the bathroom. 

Damien told Today: 'We
 were in class... we went in the bathroom, then they [sirens] went off 
again. Then we heard the tornado, it sounded like a train coming by.

'Then
 we were all in cover. A teacher took cover of us, Miss Crosswhite. She 
was covering me and my friend Zachary. I told her we were fine because 
we were holding on to something then she went over to my friend Antonio 
and covered him. So she saved our lives.'

At nearby Briarwood Elementary, students took shelter in hallways 
and under their desks as the tornado headed straight for them. Miraculously, most escaped with minor injuries despite EF5 damage being reported nearby.  However first-grade teacher Suzanne Hale was impaled by a metal pole through her lower leg as she protected her students.

A second-grade teacher Annette Brown told newsok.com
 how she and students, including her son who attends the school, were pinned to the ground by a
 collapsed roof.  She said that she held her son's hand for the entire 
time despite losing feeling in her arms.

David Wheeler told the New York Post that he drove at 100mph to reach his eight-year-old son Gabriel. He said he arrived to find the school completely gone but his son sitting with a teacher, bruised and with cuts, but otherwise okay.

He said that Gabriel's teacher - who Mr Wheeler identified as Julie Simon - had saved her students' lives by putting them in the closet after thinking the hallway did not look safe.

Relief: David Wheeler (pictured with his son Gabriel) said he drove at 100mph to rescue his son from Briarwood Elementary which was also hit by the tornado. He found his son alive but with minor injuries

Overwhelmed: One tearful rescuer said 'good job, teach' after he pulled a woman shielding three children with her body from under a car which had been tossed into the Tower Plaza school's hallway. Right, rescuers lift an injured person from the school into an ambulance

One
 little girl, who was not identified, told News9 that she clung to her 
desk when the tornado hit. She told the TV station that dirt got in her 
eyes and desks piled up on top of each other. Another told how they were told to cover their heads with their arms as the ceiling tiles flew off.

Plaza Towers, a one-story school,which was built 57 years ago and is made of cinder block, had its roof torn off in 200mph winds.

Few homes in Oklahoma have basements, which means that many families instead rely on 'safe rooms' for shelter during a tornado.

Basements
 are rare in the state because of the damp soil, meaning water seeps 
into storm cellars and basements, which leads to mold and fungus. Water 
pressure can also build up due to the soaked soil, which puts pressure 
on basement walls and the concrete can eventually give way.

Much of Oklahoma is also built on bedrock, which can be hard to break down for the basement.

Neither
 Moore nor Oklahoma City have designated public storm shelters, and 
residents are told to go to their basements or storm cellars if they 
have them.

If they do not, they are advised to go to interior hallways and to stay away from windows..

Another
 Plaza teacher, Becky Jo Evans was hailed a hero after she also shielded 
students with her body as the walls of the school crumbled around them, 
according to the LA Times.

One neighbor who had run to the school 
for shelter said: 'They [students] crouched in hallways and bathrooms, 
waiting, hoping and praying. Then the school started coming apart.'

As remarkable stories of courage and survival emerged, the desperate search for missing people waned.

Initial reports said as many as 91 people across the suburb south of Oklahoma City could have been killed in the tragedy, but officials confirmed on Tuesday morning that there have been 24 deaths.

They explained that some had been counted twice amid the chaos.

They now fear for as many as 40 
others and expect the death count to rise. At least 240 people are 
injured, 60 of these children. Oklahoma hospitals are packed with people suffering head injuries and lacerations from flying debris.

Parents
 of missing children from Plaza Towers Elementary had waited at St Andrews United Methodist 
Church nearby the school on Monday, some with nowhere else to go.

The
 names of those who were pulled alive from the wreckage were called out 
with a bullhorn. For many parents, the agonizing wait continues.

Another teacher who works at Plaza told of his heartbreak at what had happened to the little school with 500 students and around 50 teaching staff.

Hayden Young wrote on his Facebook page: 'I 
want everyone to know I am okay!  I am so broken from all I have 
witnessed today and tonight helping out at Plaza.

'I don't know how to
 describe it, but just tragic... And overwhelming..  We got a great 
staff and brave people who work a Plaza.

'In the aftermath that I 
witnessed helping families, my heart is truly overwhelmed and broken....
 I am praying and believing God has a purpose in this.'
