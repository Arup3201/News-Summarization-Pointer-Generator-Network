A Polish minibus driver accused of mowing down and killing a cyclist at 50mph was looking at photos of vintage sports cars on his mobile phone moments before the crash, a court heard today.

Andrzej Wojcicki, 44, is accused of causing the death of Owain Richard James, 30, who was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge, South Wales last July.

Mr James suffered severe head injuries in the crash and never regained consciousness.

Cardiff Crown Court heard how police found photos Wojcicki, from Swansea, South Wales, had taken photos of vintage sports cars while driving, less than half a mile from the crash scene.

On trial: Andrzej Wojcicki, 44, is accused of looking at photos on his phone before he caused the death of Owain Richard James, 30, who was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge, South Wales last July

The jury also heard how Wojcicki failed to stop for a 'considerable distance' and 'behaved strangely' by taking photographs of the scene immediately after the crash.

He denies causing Mr James' death by dangerous driving.

Prosecutor Nicholas Gareth Jones told the jury: 'He was looking at photographs he'd just taken rather than concentrating on his driving.

'To drive in that way, not see a cyclist that was visible for a long distance ahead of the vehicle, is clearly dangerous.

'The defendant was in the near side lane of the dual carriageway. The cyclist was riding inside a white rumble strip on the left hand side of the road.

'The prosecution believe the driver never saw the cyclist at all because he was distracted until after he collided with him.

'He may not have even realised he had collided with the cyclist immediately because he didn't stop for some considerable distance after the collision.

'The left side of the minibus hit the cyclist from behind. He suffered very severe injuries and he never regained consciousness.'

Tragedy: Mr Harris was knocked down and killed on the A472 at Newbridge in South Wales last July

Case: Wojcicki, originally from Poland, 'behaved very strangely' and had been taking photos of the scene where Mr Harris died, Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, heard

Wojcicki, originally from Poland, was driving a left-hand drive minibus with his wife as a front seat passenger along the dual carriageway with Mr James cycling ahead of him.

Following the collision, Mr Jones said the 'defendant behaved very strangely and started taking photographs of the scene.'

He added that Wojcicki told witnesses at the scene that he had not seen the cyclist but later told police that the cyclist had swerved into his path..

Witness Matthew Smallman of Abersychan, who was driving behind the minibus, said: 'As we were progressing near to the cyclist, I left enough room, I was waiting for the white minibus to indicate right and go from the slow lane to the fast lane and give the cyclist the room that was required.

'The minibus was getting closer and closer to the cyclist was coming up to 15 to 20 yards. I thought then the minibus was just going to swerve out.

'The minibus didn't alter his course whatsoever, no break lights. The minibus ploughed into the cyclist.'

Mr Smallman said he followed the minibus until it stopped to get the registration because other drivers had stopped to care for Mr James.

The trial continues.
