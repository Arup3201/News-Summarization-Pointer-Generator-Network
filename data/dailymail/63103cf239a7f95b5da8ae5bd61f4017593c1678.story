Facebook users are so enamored with the man in a mugshot posted to the Stockton, California page Wednesday that they liked the felon's police photo over 20,000 times in less than 24 hours.

The ice blue-eyed, strong-jawed likeness of Jeremy Meeks was just as quickly plastered across Twitter as thousands of social media users have themselves been arrested...by the 30-year-old's undeniable good looks.

Meeks, already a convicted felon, was hauled in as part of a gang police sweep, but he's the one sweeping internet denizens off their feet.

Stealing hearts: Jeremy Meeks, 30, was arrested in a gang raid by Stockton, California police on Wednesday. His arresting mugshot was subsequently posted to the police department's Facebook page and in fewer than 24 hours gained over 20,000 likes and received nearly six thousand comments and counting

The police puns continue on the Stockton Police Facebook page, where the photo had an unbelievable 5,800 comments by Thursday evening.

Most comments stuck to the obvious jokes:' What is he guilty of?! First Degree Sexiness?!' wrote Ashley Pruitt Carden.

Others, like Rhonda Cee, saw a moneymaking opportunity. 'He'll probably be on next years prison calendar...Mr....EVERY MONTH!' she wrote.

By far, one of the most thing to post was a comment about Meeks having missed his calling as a model.

'He needs to be a model,' wrote Bettina Jones. 'I would buy whatever he's selling!'

Meeks was charged with illegally possessing firearms and ammo, carrying a loaded firearm in public and criminal street gang activity, reports TMZ.

The repeat offender is being held on $900,000 bail, but perhaps not for long. There's talk amongst the commenters of raising the funds to set him free.

'He didn't know any different. I could turn him into a "model" citizen. Where can I pay his bail?' wrote Deborah Ann Mitchell.
