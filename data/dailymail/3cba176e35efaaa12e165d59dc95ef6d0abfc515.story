The 'fantasy' portrayal of Edwardian country house life in Dowton Abbey is 'b*******, basically,' said the historian and broadcaster A.N. Wilson yesterday.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the outspoken historian took aim at the smash hit period drama, dubbing it a 'sanitised version of the past'.

'I don't want to be too serious about it, but the idea that Downton Abbey represents this country's finest hour is b*******, basically,' Mr Wilson said.

He apologised for his colourful use of language immediately, but added that the Downton Abbey world, created by Julian Fellowes, though 'harmless fun' was far removed from reality.

'Julian Fellowes has claimed that Downton Abbey - which is sheer fantasy and a sanitised version of the past - is realistic and that we ought to go back to the old days,' he said.

'I'm not being po-faced about it, but a programme that depicted the real lives of servants would have been an interesting one.

'It's worth emphasising how dirty and how smelly life was for almost everybody before about 1950.'

Downton Abbey is a period drama set in the early 20th century in an English country house. A new series of the programme is set to begin tomorrow.

It was the second time this week Mr Wilson has turned his guns on Mr Fellowes, after he accused the Dowton creator of having a 'childish, snobbish mindset' in an article for the Daily Mail.

In the article, published on Wednesday, he accused Fellowes's Downton Abbey of glorifying 'an ordering of society that was hateful in real life.'

'Fellowes would like to promote the idea that ill-considered costume dramas such as Downton Abbey are only a bit of fun,' wrote Mr Wilson.

'But I find the widespread taste for it dismaying because it gives me the impression that the great British public have learned no lessons about the iniquity of class prejudice in the past 100 years.'
