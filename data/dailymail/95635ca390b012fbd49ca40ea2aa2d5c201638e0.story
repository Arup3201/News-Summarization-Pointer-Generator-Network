The heart has long been a symbol of  love, devotion and sensuality but advanced medical techniques are now turning the organ into a thing of beauty.

These stunning images show this year’s winners of the British Heart Foundation’s Reflections of Research science image competition.

Using medical devices such as MRI scans and microscopes, medical experts have captured the heart in a totally new light, highlighting its complexity and mystery.

The overall winners of the british Heart Foundation competition were Dr Gillian Gray, Megan Swim and Harris Morrison of the University of Edinburgh, whose 'The Broken Heart' won Image of the Year. The image reveals the remarkable 3D structure of an adult mouse heart

The overall winners were Dr Gillian Gray, Megan Swim and Harris Morrison of the University of Edinburgh, whose 'The Broken Heart' won Image of the Year.

Their image reveals the remarkable 3D structure of an adult mouse heart.  The picture was taken using a new technique called optical projection tomography (OPT) which is being developed to enable experts to better measure the extent of injury after a heart attack and to assess repair.

Dr Jana Koth of the University of Oxford won the Mending Broken Hearts Award with her image entitled 'Caught in the Net'.

The picture depicts the front view of a developing two-day-old zebrafish heart. Scientists study the creatures because of their remarkable ability to repair their own hearts after damage - an ability which we currently lack.

The green cells are heart muscle cells, and the red and blue staining shows components that make up the muscle. The early heart tube has started to loop.

'At the Heart of It', by Emma Kay from Queen Mary, University of London, shows white blood cells in the heart sensing invading microbes and kick starting the immune response

It consists of two sections – the large, thin atrium (where blood flows in) and the smaller, thicker ventricle (where blood leaves the heart).

Dr Andrew Cobb of King’s College London was highly commended for 'At the Heart of a Cell'.

It shows a heart-shaped image of a nucleus from a single vascular smooth muscle cell. Vascular smooth muscle helps give blood vessels their shape.

The green specks show multiple regions of DNA damage, which could explain the unusual shape.

Dragonfly, by Arianna Fornili and Franca Fraternali at King¿s College London, illustrates the simulated motion of a two-headed fragment of myosin, an essential molecule found in heart muscle

Dr William Moody from the University of Birmingham was also commended for his image 'What Sets your Heart on Fire?'

It shows an MRI of the heart of a healthy kidney donor. The MRI technique is sensitive enough to detect early scar formation and a scan can pick up if there are any changes in the heart after donating a kidney, which could potentially be treated with medication.

Dr Yichuan Wen and Dr David Leake from the University of Reading took 'Killer Cholesterol' which was also highly commended. It shows immune cells – called foam cells – which are present in the arteries of people with atherosclerosis (stiffening and hardening of the arteries).

'Rough Road to Regeneration' by Andrea Caporali at the University of Bristol uses a scanning-electron microscope to capture an image that shows the stress response of a blood vessel cell under conditions like diabetes

Dr Yichuan Wen and Dr David Leake from the University of Reading took 'Killer Cholesterol' which shows immune cells ¿ called foam cells ¿ which are present in arteries of people with atherosclerosis (stiffening and hardening of the arteries)

The white specks show cholesterol is captured within the foam cells. This cholesterol can be altered by the cells to produce damaging effects which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

Other entrants in the competition included 'Spaghetti Junction' by Graeme Birdsey and Dr Anna Randi from Imperial College London.

This microscope image shows cells which line blood vessels and reveals the proteins that provide support and shape to the cell. These are elongated actin stress fibres (shown in green) and the tangled web of microtubules (shown in red).

'The Forgotten Majority' by Katja Gehmlich and Sina Lenski, of the University of Oxford highlights how the heart is not exclusively made up of beating cells. In fact, the majority of cells are cardiac fibroblasts which do not initiate movement at all

'At the Heart of It', by Emma Kay from Queen Mary, University of London, shows white blood cells in the heart sensing invading microbes and kick starting the immune response. This image shows white blood cells with receptors (pink) migrating from a small vein (turquoise) in response to bacteria.

'Rough Road to Regeneration' by Andrea Caporali at the University of Bristol uses a scanning-electron microscope to capture an image that shows the stress response of a blood vessel cell under conditions like diabetes.

Understanding the stresses that diabetes places on the cardiovascular system, and the changes in cellular structure and behaviour, may help researchers cure the complications of diabetes.

Finally Dragonfly, by Arianna Fornili and Franca Fraternali at King’s College London, illustrates the simulated motion of a two-headed fragment of myosin, an essential molecule found in heart muscle.

Different time frames of this dragonfly-shaped molecule are simultaneously shown, with red spikes indicating the direction of motion.
