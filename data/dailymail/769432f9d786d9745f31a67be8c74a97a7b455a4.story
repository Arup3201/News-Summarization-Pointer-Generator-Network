A mother had to have a hysterectomy at 19 after doctors missed a minor infection which could have been treated with antibiotics.

Hayley Sanders has now been awarded a five-figure settlement from her local NHS trust.

Miss Sanders underwent the operation to remove her womb barely a fortnight after having her first child, Jayden, by Caesarean section on December 27, 2009.

Hayley Sanders developed an infection after the birth of her son, Jayden, in December 2009. Despite having a high temperature, she was discharged from hospital

Four of the checks carried out immediately after the birth revealed high temperature readings – a warning sign of an infection.

Despite that, Miss Sanders was discharged from Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital three days later.

But on New Year’s Day, Miss Sanders 
was rushed back into hospital after developing severe abdominal pain and
 spent several days in the high dependency unit.

She fell into a coma as her body 
fought the deadly infection. It is thought it was caused by one of the 
internal examinations she was given during labour.

It could have been treated with a 
simple course of antibiotics. Instead, doctors were eventually left with
 no choice but to perform a complete hysterectomy to save her life.

Ms Sanders was rushed back to hospital two days after being discharged. As the infection took hold of her body, she fell into a coma and doctors were forced to perform a hysterectomy to save her life

If Ms Sanders had been given antibiotics as soon as she developed a high temperature, she would not have needed a hysterectomy and she would be able to have more children in future

The 
23-year-old was awarded a ‘five-figure’ pay-out from Heart of England 
NHS Foundation Trust, shortly before the case was due to be heard in the
 High Court.

Miss Sanders says she is ‘disgusted’ 
by her treatment. She has been left with ongoing health problems as a 
result of her hysterectomy, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

She will also require specialist scar revision surgery to her stomach.

Ms Sanders has now received a five-figure pay-out from Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust - it will cover her loss of earnings and pay for the counselling she has required as a result of the incident

Ms Sanders said: 'I couldn't believe that if staff had only given me antibiotics I would never have needed a hysterectomy'

She said: ‘I just could not believe that at 19 years of age I wouldn’t be able to have children again.

‘I was devastated and determined to 
get to the bottom of how it could have happened. When I heard the 
evidence I was absolutely appalled. 

‘I couldn’t believe that if staff had 
only given me antibiotics I would never have needed a hysterectomy, I 
would have been able to make the most of bonding with Jayden in the 
first weeks of his life and I would have, one day, been able to give him
 a little brother or sister.

Ms Sanders now hopes that the hospital has learnt from its mistakes and that no other women will go through the same trauma she experienced

‘Instead I was robbed of this and have
 been left with a host of ongoing problems that are a constant reminder 
of the failings in my care.

‘The whole situation has been made 
worse by the fact the Trust has never taken responsibility for its 
actions or even just said sorry. Nothing can make up for what happened 
but it would at least give me some closure to allow me to begin 
rebuilding my life.’

Emma Rush, of law firm Irwin Mitchell,
 said: ‘Hospital staff missed multiple opportunities to recognise that 
Hayley’s high temperature was the result of an infection that is not 
uncommon in maternity patients and that simple antibiotics would have 
treated [it].

‘Instead she became critically ill as 
the infection took over her body and the only option of saving her was 
to perform a hysterectomy to remove the source of the infection.’

‘This is obviously a horrendous ordeal
 for any person to go through, but particularly difficult for a 
19-year-old who hoped to have more children.’

A spokesman for the Heart of England 
NHS Trust said: ‘A detailed action plan is developed to improve and 
learn from the findings of investigations and this is monitored and 
inspected by senior teams of doctors nurses and midwives. Unfortunately,
 Hayley Sanders suffered complications during the course of the delivery
 of her son.

‘Whilst no admissions of liability 
were made, a financial settlement was achieved and we wish Hayley and 
her family all the best for the future.’

The body can be vulnerable to some infections after birth.

The most common is endometritis - an infection of the lining of the womb.

Some women also develop infections of the breast, C-section scar, or urinary tract.

Women who have C-sections are at significantly higher risk of endometritis than those who have a natural delivery.

Symptoms of an infection include fever, chills and malaise.

Some women with endometritis also develop abdominal pain.

Other symptoms of a breast infection (mastitis) include a painful, hard, warm, red area on one breast, a headache and fatigue.

Other symptoms of a urinary tract infection include painful urination and bloody or cloudy urine.

An infection can quickly become serious if untreated so sufferers should be given an immediate course of antibiotics.
