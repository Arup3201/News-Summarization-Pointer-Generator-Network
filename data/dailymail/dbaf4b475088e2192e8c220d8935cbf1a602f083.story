If your boomerang children are getting under your feet, this could be an affordable solution.

The ‘microhome’ is small enough to be erected at the end of your garden and offers all the luxuries a postgraduate twenty-something who can’t afford independence might want.

It has a double bed, fitted kitchen, bathroom and a widescreen TV in the lounge area.

The brainchild of Dr Mike Page of the University of Hertfordshire, the basic model costs £10,000 and is as easy to build as an Ikea bookcase.

At just 10ft square and 13ft high, you won’t need massive grounds to accommodate it and it doesn’t need planning permission because it is classed as a caravan.

The wooden structure has solar panels and a mechanical heat recovery system meaning low running costs.

‘It’s an ideal living space for a boomerang kid or others finding it difficult to find independent accommodation,’ said Dr Page.
