Publisher Iain Dale today wrestled a protester to the ground as he tried to disrupt a TV interview with controversial spin doctor Damian McBride.

The bizarre scene on the Brighton seafront saw Mr Dale grappling with anti-nuclear protester Stuart Holmes who regularly holds up placards during live TV broadcasts.

Mr Dale later admitted he had 'gone nuclear' after pushing Holmes to the floor, with his pet dog looking on.

Tumble: As publisher Iain Dale tries to protester Stuart Holmes getting into the back of the interviews, he ends up on the floor

Protest: Even after being pushed to the ground, Mr Holmes tried to get his message across

Dignified: Viewers had no idea what was going on, as Mr Dale made his move

Mr Dale's extraordinarily intervention came as Mr McBride was plugging his explosive memoirs Power Trip on ITV's Daybreak.

Mr Holmes often appears in the background of TV broadcasts, holding up placards campaigning against nuclear power.

As he tried to use the interest in the McBride book to further his cause this morning, he came up against Mr Dale, who runs BiteBack, the firm publishing Power Trip today.

The barking of the protester's dog - which eagerly joined in the commotion - could be heard by TV viewers as the struggle continued.

But the terrier - carrying placards reading 'No Nukes' on its back - failed to live up to the loyalty expected from dogs, jumping up and biting its owner on the rear.

Fight: Others piled in to help Mr Dale in his efforts to stop the broadcast being interrupted

Publicity: Protester Mr Holmes is a regular on the media circuit, hoping to see his banners caught on camera

During the interview Mr McBride defended his decision to release the book, lifting the lid on the culture of lies and smears in the last Labour government, during the Labour conference.

He told Daybreak: 'Two separate things - why I decided to write the book is I wanted to tell my story about my time in politics and all the lessons that I learnt from it and, indeed, the lessons that both the Labour party and other parties can learn from the way that I got brought into the political system and the way that effectively started to operate in a way that was unacceptable.

'In terms of why I’m publishing it now, I was always going to write this book at some stage, I had more lucrative offers to publish it close to the general election when it would have caused more of a distraction and chose not to do that. I though the earlier I published it the better.'

Referring to the incident with Mr Holmes, Mr Dale later wrote on Twitter: 'Oh dear, I seem to have gone nuclear... Mirror photographer tells me I did what the snappers have wanted to do for years!'

Career protesters butting in on everything annoy the absolute heck out of everyone except the seasonal ones of course, even his dog wouldn't stop joining in on attacking him even when it's over,  i've really never seen that in a dog before, it was probably grabbing it's own chance to protest at being dragged along to be involved in it's owners no doubt numerous arguments whilst being made to wear awkward uncomfortable signs (cruelty i'm afraid) like it's only purpose to him is to gain sympathy and be a walking slogan billboard. wonder if the owner fed it properly as it was only annoyed at him and not the angry guy attacking him which is really strange.

He needs charging for assault. It is disgusting him attacking and old man. Protesting isn't illegal

He should train his dog to go for the 'jewels'.

 Though Mr  Dale is nothing less than expect from a Labour party employee / member.

Disgusting.

What right has he got to assault anyone? Where are the Police when this is plain and clear....ignoring Politicians crimes today, and hunting down celebs crimes in the 1960's.

Yea, people standing up for what is right, is a real nuance to society.

Get out from under your 'Everything is OK' banner and open your eyes.

You are deluded to say the least.

Ian Dale... LBC will be interesting tomorrow afternoon! Maybe a debate on: freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or public displays of aggression on Brighton sea front?

He should press charges, that is common assault.
