No one has been arrested in connection with the incident which took place in Morley, West Yorkshire, on Saturday afternoon. 

Rhys and George were both pupils at schools in Morley where more than 50 teenagers gathered today to leave flowers at the scene of the crash. 

Today a relative of the younger of the pair described his death as 'such a shock'. 

Two other teenagers, named locally as Kameron Walters, 14 and 15-year-old Joshua Van Veen, remain in critical condition in hospital.  

The brother of the 21-year-old who was driving the car when it crashed today denied accusations he had been running an unlicensed taxi service. 

Speaking at the family home, Scott McMeekin said his brother was 'friends' with the school pupils because they had a mutual interest in cars. 

'They were his friends because they all like cars and go to car meets. They were his friends and they didn't have to pay him to get in the car.'

He added his brother may have been paralysed in the crash which saw the car he bought just last month ruined. 

Mr McMeekin's brother denied accusations he had been operating an unlicensed taxi and said he would have offered the boys a lift because they were friends. Police are investigating the claim the boys did not have their parents' permission when they got into the car

'We won't know for the next 72 hours. The hospital said they are crucial.

Of the youngsters killed in the crash he said his family was 'truly sorry' for their deaths. 

 'No family should have to go through this. No mother should have to bury her son.'

On Sunday more than 50 teenagers gathered today at the scene and one of Rhys's family members said: 'It's such a shock. It's so sad. We don't want to say any more.'

George was a pupil at Morley Academy and Rhys attended Bruntcliffe High School.

Flowers have been laid at the scene and hundreds of tributes have started to pour in on social media for both boys.

Darcey-Jo Davey said: 'Love you George so much respect for everyone who came and also his dad that had the guts to come and read all the messages and Rhys family it broke my heart to see the two families.' 

Bethany Buchanan said: 'George babe tomorrow I am gonna have a send off for you. I can't believe I have to let you go it is so hard for me bro.

'You were always here for me and everything you were like my little brother I need you back. You may be gone but never forgotten.'

Police are appealing for witnesses of the incident that took place on Gelderd Road, Morley.

The two other boys are in a 'life threatening condition' at hospital and the driver is 'serious but stable'.

One of the messages from Taylor and Alex said: 'Rest in peace thoughts go out to your families'

'The two boys were from the local area and attended Brunswick High and the Morley Academy and we are also supporting those schools at this difficult time.

'It is thought that a 21-year-old man picked the four boys up from their homes without the permission of their parents.

'We are appealing for any witnesses to how the car - a blue coloured Peugeot was being driven before the incident. We believe the car over took another vehicle at speed and then collided with the tree.

'No other vehicles are believed to have been involved in the incident although it is thought the car over took another vehicle at speed during the incident.

'The driver also remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition.'

Officers are appealing for anyone who saw the movements of the vehicle that day to come forward.

Any witnesses are asked to contact the Major Collision and Enquiry Team on 101.
