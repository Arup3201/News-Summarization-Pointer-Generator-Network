Frustrated commuters spend the equivalent of 16 working days a year sitting in traffic jams, a survey reveals today.

It says gridlock in major cities has ‘worsened considerably’ over the past 12 months.

In the most congested areas, evening rush hour journeys last 80 per cent longer than they would in free-flowing traffic.

The poll is published ahead of the Easter Bank Holiday getaway, when 16million people are expected to hit the road.

It found that last year, 14 of the UK’s 17 biggest cities had worse congestion than they did in 2013.

Delays at morning and evening rush hour are wasting 129 hours a year – the equivalent of 16 eight-hour working days.

Belfast has the worst jams, with the average journey lasting 39 per cent longer than it would if the roads were clear. 

London was the next-worst city for hold-ups with average journeys taking 37per cent longer than in free-flowing traffic and 67per cent in the evening peak.

1 - Belfast: 82 per cent

2 - London: 67 per cent

3 - Edinburgh: 71 per cent

4 - Brighton/Hove: 59 per cent

5 - Manchester: 72 per cent

6 - Bristol:  56 per cent

7 - Nottingham: 57 per cent

Other cities where gridlock has got worse include  Nottingham, Leicester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Southampton.

Bristol the only destination where jams had eased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013. 

Figures for Sheffield and for Leeds/Bradford ‘failed to improve’ and were about the same over the period. 

Analysis of 12 trillion pieces of traffic data worldwide revealed, perhaps not surprisingly, that the evening rush hour is the most congested time of day.

Worldwide, the worst city was Istanbul, with average journeys taking 58per cent longer than in free-flowing conditions, rising to as high as 109per cent in the evening peak.

At 55 per cent, Mexico City was the second-worst world city, followed by Rio de Janeiro which was 51 per cent.

The survey was carried out by sat-nav firm TomTom, which analysed 12trillion pieces of traffic data worldwide.

Its vice-president for traffic, Ralf-Peter Schaefer, said: ‘Road authorities and local governments can use traffic data to better manage traffic flow and businesses can plan smarter working hours.’ 

Roads over the long Bank Holiday and extended school-holiday break are set to be 'twice as busy this Easter', says traffic information firm INRIX which monitors flows on the nation's highways.

And journey times to major airports like Heathrow and Gatwick are set to quadruple from Thursday as gridlock on the key M25 orbital motorway between Leatherhead J9 and the M1 at J21 suffers delays of two hours.
