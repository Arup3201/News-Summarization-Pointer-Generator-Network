A driver who advertised on Facebook for a volunteer to take his speeding penalty points has been jailed.

Scott Woodburn, 32, paid Daniel Baggaley, 26, £250 to admit his speeding 
offence so he could escape being banned from driving, Highway officials said today.

South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership said his five-month sentence given to him last month 'will send a warning to anyone who would consider anything so irresponsible'.

Woodburn, from Rotherham, was caught breaking the speed limit on the A61 Halifax Road in Sheffield on November 6, 2011.

As a result of the single offence he was expected to have points added to his licence.

But the points for speeding would have tipped him over the 12 point maximum of allowed penalty points and he could have been disqualified from driving.

So according to the Safer Road Partnership, he posted on Facebook asking someone to take the points in return for payment.

Baggaley, who does not hold a driving licence, took up his offer and admitted the speeding offence and was paid £250 by Woodburn.

A spokesman for the partnership, which represents organisations including police, councils and the Highways Agency, said Woodburn refused to co-operate with the investigation and only pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice when the strength of evidence against him became clear.

Police used forensic evidence to prove it was Woodburn driving, the spokesman said.

On top of the five-month prison sentence, Woodburn was disqualified from driving when he appeared at Sheffield Crown Court on December 19.

Baggaley, from Sheffield, received an 11-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and a 12-month supervision order when he admitted the same offence in June last year.

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police confirmed Woodburn
had accumulated a number of points due to previous offences and the 
latest speeding offence would have taken him over 12 points which could 
have led to his disqualification from driving.

The spokesman for South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership said: 'Hopefully this case will send a warning to anyone who would consider anything so irresponsible.

'It is a crime to admit an offence on behalf of someone else. If someone approaches you to admit an offence on their behalf you should inform the police.

'Woodburn showed no regard for anyone else. He was prepared to drive at excessive speed. Once caught, rather than changing the manner of his driving he selfishly paid to have someone else to take the blame so that he could continue behaving as before.'

He added: 'South Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership aim to improve road safety on South Yorkshire's roads by tracing and prosecuting serial offenders who provide false information in an attempt to avoid prosecution. These offenders are a danger to themselves and other road users.'
