A new doll, which depicts an anatomically correct baby boy complete with penis and testicles, has divided Australian parents with some claiming it is inappropriate.

The You & Me Mommy Change My Diaper doll, sold by Toys "R" Us, makes slurping sounds when he is fed through his bottle and cries when he wets his nappy, only stopping when he is changed.

But it is the realistic depiction of his genitals that has parents up in arms and it seems that parents are divided roughly along gendered lines, with fathers strongly objecting to the doll, while mothers have no problem with it.

Angry: You & Me Mommy Change My Diaper Doll from Toys "R" Us has some parents frowning

A post about the doll on an online mother's group generated more than 300 comments in less than 24 hours.

In the original post, Bree Minster shared a picture of the doll, with the caption: 'I just showed my partner this doll and asked him if he would let our daughter play with it. He says no. What do your partners think?'

Overwhelming the mothers were in favour of the doll, describing it as 'natural' and long overdue, whereas many women said their partners objected to the doll.

'I just showed my partner he said no way [our daughter] doesn't need to know about boys until she is 30,' wrote Anita Good.

'I just asked hubby and his reply was NO!! I said "why?" and he said "because it's f***ing gross!!"' wrote Simmone Taylor.

One woman said her partner blamed doll such as this one for the premature sexualisation of children.

'My partner said it's not necessary! No need to have a little girl touching a doll willy. He thinks that's why so many young kids are sexually active younger these days because parents let their children "see more".'

Dr Joanne Orlando from the School of Education at the University of Western Sydney says those fears are almost certainly unfounded.

Would you let your child play with this anatomically correct doll?

'The counter-argument that girls will interact with these dolls in a sexual way is a pretty weak argument, we don't have any research to support that, unless they're in an environment where an adult is interacting with it in a sexual way,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'Gender is a normal part of life, anatomically different parts of our body are a normal part of life, and children learn that from a very early age, we're not telling them something they don't know already.'

And as one mother wrote, this is not the first anatomically correct male doll to cause controversy.

'I hadâ€¦ the boy baby born growing up and my uncle didn't agree so he cut its doodle off. My kids both have one [and] I'm fully okay with it,' wrote Jeanette Marie Simpson-Smith on the online forum.

The first anatomically correct male doll, the Archie Bunker's Grandson Joey Stivic doll, was created in 1976 and is still available for purchase on eBay. The first doll to wet its nappy was the Betsy Wetsy doll, created in the 1930s.
