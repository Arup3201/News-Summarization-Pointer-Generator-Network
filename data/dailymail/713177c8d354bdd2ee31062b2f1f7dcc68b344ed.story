A woman has been handed five consecutive life sentences for sexually abusing a 10-year-old male relative in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Melissa Kay Anderson, 35, pleaded no contest to assaulting the child and forcing him to watch her have sex with her boyfriend.

She also forced her victim to use sex toys on her, and showed him pornography. 

'Heinous': A judge said Melissa Kay Anderson, 35, 'should not breathe fresh air again' as she was handed five life sentences for sexually abusing a 10-year-old male relative and forcing him to watch her have sex

Passing sentence based on the 'heinous' nature of the crime, Tulsa City Assistant District Attorney Kevin Gray said: 'I don't believe Ms Anderson should breathe fresh air again.'

Her boyfriend and co-defendant Michael Burris has pleaded not guilty to one count of child sexual abuse and one count of allowing child sexual abuse. 

Anderson was arrested in September after the victim told his father about the assault, Tulsa World reported.

She was charged with five counts of child sex abuse, to which she pleaded guilty in November.

The trial revealed Anderson was 'high on methamphetamine' during a number of the assaults.

Defending, Chuck Sullivan said Anderson was abused as a child and said a life sentence would be a second 'failure of the system'.

According to The Examiner, police said the 10-year-old 'is a total hero to speak out when he did and to tell his story, and that's to be commended.'

Burris is being held on a $1 million bond. He will face a jury on May 11.
