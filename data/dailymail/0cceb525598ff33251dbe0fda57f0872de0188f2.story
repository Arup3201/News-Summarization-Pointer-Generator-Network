A University of Texas graduate student was left fighting for his life on Thursday after two chimpanzees pounced on him at the South African reserve where he was studying their behaviour, dragging him along the ground for more than a mile.

The mother of 26-year-old Andrew Oberle said that her son had been passionate about chimps since watching a documentary about famous naturalist Jane Goodall in seventh grade.

Mary Flint added that her son knew the risks involved in working with apes, and said that the attack would probably not stop him carrying out further research.

Attack: Andrew Oberle, a University of Texas graduate student was savaged by two chimps while leading a group of tourists at the Jane Goodall Institute in South Africa

Brutal: Andrew Oberle, was dragged more than a mile by the chimps

In a case that mirrors that of Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman, who in 2009 had her face ripped off by a 200-pound chimp, Mr Oberle suffered a ‘frenzied’ attack, in which he was bitten multiple times.

The
beasts, named Mickey and Amadeus, grabbed him by his feet and yanked 
him down the road, under a fence and into their enclosure at the Jane Goodall Institute Chimp Eden near Nelspruit, South Africa, where paramedics were forced to wait for armed escorts before they could go in and treat him.

Mr Oberle, an American researcher, was giving tourists
a lecture at the sanctuary as part of his master's degree in Anthropology and Primatology, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

He had crossed the first of two fences separating the chimpanzees from visitors and was standing close to the second fence, which is electrified, when the attack began.

The tourists were escorted to safety 
by staff members as the chimpanzees dragged Mr Oberle out of their 
enclosure. The sanctuary's director fired shots into the air to scare
the chimps away from the man, before chasing the animals back into 
their enclosure.

Medics stabilised the graduate at the scene and he was taken by ambulance to a private hospital in Nelspruit. Beeld reported that he lost part of an ear and parts of his fingers.

'When
we found him, he was in a foetal position underneath a lapa (a roofed, 
open-walled structure) with massive injuries, lacerations, abrasions, 
partial amputation from his head to toe,' Lloyd Krause, ER24 emergency 
service spokesman told the Herald Sun.

'He lost an ear, he lost a number of 
fingers and toes, he's got very deep wounds, he's got total removal of 
skin and muscle off his one leg and his one arm, fractures all over the 
place.'

On Oberle's Facebook page he is listed as 
being from Saint Louis, Missouri. He now lives in San Antonio, Texas, but has been in South Africa since May.

He recently posted 
photographs of the chimps he was working with on the website, tagged with comments such
as 'so cute' beside a picture of two of them sleeping.

Another
portrays a wide-mouthed chimp named Cozy, who suffered brain damage 
after being abused prior to his rescue. Oberle describes the primate as 
'still the best', adding:  'Cozy may hit people in the head with rocks but it's not his fault'.

One of Cozy's victims, Stacey Johns, is also pictured in the album with blood pouring from a wound in her head.

Oberle, apparently fascinated by the 
primates, was experimenting with different food types and on Monday 
wrote that they enjoyed an offering of oatmeal. Last Saturday he wrote 
that 'mustard was a big hit'.

The sanctuary opened six years ago and is home to rescued chimpanzees, many of which suffered horrific abuse, hunted for their meat or used in the entertainment industry or at roadside zoos.

One adult male arrived almost completely shaven and dressed as a little boy, wearing a gold watch and carrying a suitcase of clothes, the center's website said.

David Oosthuizen, executive director, said in a statement: 'This is a terrible tragedy that should never happen. All our thoughts and prayers are with this young man and his family.'

He added that the chimps’ power makes
them a force to be feared. They have six times the 
strength of a human being.

'Any interaction between humans and wild animals can be dangerous as wild animals are often very strong and can act aggressively if approached or if they feel threatened,' Oosthuizen said.

'Additionally, the chimpanzees at Chimp Eden have suffered horrible injuries and abuse from humans and therefore have to be treated with caution.'

The two chimpanzees were placed in their night enclosure after the attack and will be held there pending the investigation, after which they would be returned to their enclosure, said chairman Edwin Jay.

In a statement a spokesman from Oberle's university said: 'We were saddened to learn that one of our students, Andrew Oberle, sustained serious injuries as the result of a chimpanzee attack. Our hearts go out to Andrew and his family.'

In May Oberle was awarded in Geographic Information Science from UTSA. Prior to enrolling at the school he studied at St Mary's University in San Antonio.

In 2009 Charla Nash, 58, almost died in a
horrific mauling that saw her lose her eyesight, lips, nose, and hands 
after being savaged by Travis, a dangerous 200-pound chimpanzee.

Ms Nash has filed papers accusing state officials of 
failing to seize the animal before the mauling despite a staff member's 
warning that it was dangerous.

In documents attorneys explain why she should be allowed to sue the state
Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for $150 million.

The commissioner must approve any lawsuit against the state. A hearing was set for August 10.

Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen says the state shouldn't be held liable.

She received a revolutionary 
full-face transplant in June 2011 at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, nearly two years after the attack.

The operation – performed by a team of more than 30 surgeons and nurses – and subsequent recovery were widely covered. 

Prior to the surgery, she hid her face under a veil, saying that she chose to wear it ‘so I don’t scare people.’

In an interview Ms Nash told the Hartford Courant that she feels no different than she did before the attack.

‘I just feel like it’s my face,’ she said. ‘It’s just not working real good. Every day, my muscles get better.'

In past interviews,
Ms Nash revealed that having a new face allowed her simple human 
pleasures – she has regained her sense of smell and can eat again.

She is even regaining sensation in her forehead, cheeks, eyebrow, and nose.

But most of all, she’s learning how to smile. ‘It creases up here,’ Ms Nash told the Courant as she pointed at her mouth.

‘I don’t know what the future’s doing (sic) to bring… so I don’t get my hopes up,’ Ms Nash said,

But she added that she wants to progress far enough that she can again ride horses and live in her own house.

She
said she misses simple things – like being able to bargain hunt, bask 
in the sunshine, or even look at her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna.

‘I have to depend on a lot of help,’ she said. ‘My life depends on really not being alone. I used to be very independent.’

She also gets phantom pains in her hands, despite the fact that they were removed after the 2009 attack.

Transplants added in surgery later had to be removed because of dangerous complications.

In an interview with ABC 7 last month, Ms Nash – who likes being called Charlie – said she doesn’t want anybody’s pity.

‘I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me,’ she said. ‘I want to be like everyone else.’

She has been told by doctors that she needs to work on bulking up, as she is still quite thin for her 5ft 10in frame.

Ms Nash, who was blinded in the 2009 
attack, was fitted with brown glass eyes and hopes to get a double hand 
transplant after the first one failed.

Ara Chekmayan, a spokesman for the Nash family, told the Mail Online: 'The horrific chimpanzee attack that occurred today involving the American student further highlights the danger that these animals pose and their violent nature.

'Charla Nash knows as well as anyone the tremendous harm that a chimpanzee can inflict. Her thoughts and prayers go out to the young man and his family.'

Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features
