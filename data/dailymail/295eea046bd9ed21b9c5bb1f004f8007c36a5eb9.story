A new British-built family runaround which bosses claim is ‘the world’s best self-parking car’ has won What Car's Car Of The Year award.

The second-generation Nissan Qashqai crossover – which hits showrooms next month - was also named best small sports utility vehicle in the annual ceremony.

The new vehicle, which starts at £17,595 comes packed with technology, including 360-degree parking camera which gives a top-down bird’s eye view of the car and is position, as well as Intelligent Park Assist which steers the vehicle into a parallel parking bay.

The new Nissan Qashqai, which goes on sale next month and costs £17,595, has been named Car Of The Year by What Car?

Nissan executives say that the level technology in the new Qashqai means it is already fitted with the ‘building blocks’ needed for a self-driving car which the Japanese car maker intended to introduce by 2020.

They say the aim is to create a car with ‘zero fatalities.’

Judges praised the attention to detail of the Japanese car-firm’s crossover, which was also designed and engineered in  the UK, and said the quality of workmanship was a feather in the cap for Nissan’s 6,100-strong workforce at the factory in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.

It is the first time that Nissan has won the overall top accolade in the What Car? Car of the Year awards sponsored by Warranty Direct which were held last night among an audience of motor industry VIPs and top executives at  the Grosvenor House on London’s Park Lane.

What Car? editor-in-chief Chas Hallett said: ‘The all-new Nissan Qashqai brings excellence and polish to a class of cars that was already brimming with talent and tempting buys.

The car was designed and built in Britain by workers in Nissan's Sunderland plant

‘The Qashqai delivers low costs and first-class levels of comfort, refinement, space and safety. Nissan has thought of every last detail and it’s this complete approach that rewards it the overall 2014 What Car? Car of the Year. The Nissan team at the Sunderland plant should be justifiably proud of their achievement.’

Briton Andy Palmer, Nissan’s global chief planning officer, said: 'This is a massive vote of confidence in Britain and for Sunderland. The plant now produces more cars than the whole of Italy. It’s one of the best in the world. It encapsulates our mission to create cars which innovate and excite.’

As well as being built in Sunderland, the new Qashqai  was designed at Nissan’s European design centre in London’s Paddington and  engineered at the car-giants technical centre at Cranfield in Bedfordshire.

It had its global unveiling in London in November by Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn who flew in from Japan.

Nissan  says that the launch of new Qashqai – together with new Note which went on sale in October – will drive production at the Sunderland factory to new record levels well beyond 550,000 in 2014.

The first generation of the Qashqai was quickly nicknamed the ‘cash-cow’ because of its success in generating  money for Nissan.

Some 250,000 first generation Qashqais have been sold in UK since it's launch in 2007, with more than 2 million have been sold worldwide

Other features include traffic sign recognition which flashes up speed limits on the dashboard, Moving Object Detection warns of people or cars crossing the  vehicle’s path when reversing, Lane Departure warning which tells the driver if he or she drifts out of motorway lane without indicating and Blind Spot Warning which tells drivers if an overtaking car is approaching out of view.

A special Front Collision Avoidance system scans the road ahead using radar and, depending on speed,  can bring car to a full stop if collision is imminent. 

Dozy drivers are given a wake-up call thanks to special monitors which check the motorist’s steering activity and warns if he or she is about to fall asleep at the wheel.

The car also has a 7-inch touchscreen which  integrates satnav, phone and Bluetooth music streaming.

All engines will have ‘stop-start’  as standard, cutting out the power when idling at traffic lights to save fuel.  The lowest CO2 emissions will be 99g/km  on a 1.5-litre diesel managing 74.3miles to the gallon.

The Sunderland factory employs more than 6,100 and also builds the Note, Juke and all-electric LEAF models. In December Nissan announced  a £250million investment to  build a brand new luxury  hatchback in Sunderland – the Infiniti Q30 creating 1,000 new jobs.

Nissan Motor GB’s managing director Jim Weight said they were ‘thrilled’ with the award: ‘A huge amount of effort has gone into the design and engineering of the new car and we’re all extremely excited.’
