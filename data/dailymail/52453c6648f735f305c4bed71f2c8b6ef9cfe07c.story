Little green army men were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday, along with two other retro classics, the Rubik’s Cube and blow-your-own bubbles.

The low-tech trio of toys joins an esteemed list of childhood favorites, including Barbie, G.I. Joe, Scrabble and the hula hoop, at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, having beat out nine other finalists including Fisher-Price Little People, American Girl dolls and My Little Pony.

The tiny green heroes have been a favorite with children around the world since their creation in 1938 - and were even featured in the popular Toy Story movies.

While their popularity waned during the 20 years of the Vietnam War, their appearance in the 1995 film cemented their place as one of the world's most-loved toys and prompted several manufacturers to begin reproducing millions of them every year.

'Over the years, these toys have remained popular because they are lightweight, simple to transport in buckets or pails, fun to blow up, easy to replace,' said the Museum of Play's curator Patricia Hogan.

'But most of all because they inspire open-ended play.'

The army men made it on to the list of Hall of Fame finalists on two other occasions before finally making the cut this time around, offering hope to this year's rejected toys, which also included Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Slip 'N Slide, Operation, paper airplanes and pots and pans.

The Rubik's Cube was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in the 1970s, but really began to take off in the United States in 1980 after being imported by Ideal Toy Corp.

More than 100 million of the six-color cubes were sold between 1980 and 1982, diving an obsessively-twisting nation between those who could solve the complex puzzle - and who could not.

The cubes, which have nine colored squares on each side, can be arranged 43 quintillion ways, according to the Toy Hall of Fame, and have inspired organized competitions in more than 50 countries, along with variety of contests that require entrants to solve it blindfolded, one-handed and under water.

In a videotaped statement played at Thursday's ceremony, Mr Rubik said he was happy to see his cube added to a collection that includes chess and 'other wonderful inventions from around the world.'

'I am very satisfied that I was able to share my enjoyment and happiness in connection with discoveries ... of geometry with millions of kids all around the world,' Mr Rubik said.

Children have played with soap bubbles since at least the 17th century, according to the toy hall, when paintings depicting the play appeared in what is now modern-day Belgium.  More than 200 million bottles of bubble liquid are sold annually.

Bubbles got a nod because of their ability to inspire imagination, Hall of Fame spokesperson Shane Rhinewald revealed, listing the simple toy alongside similar inductees including the stick and blanket.

Ms Hogan, who curates the toy hall inside the museum, noted the staying power of the decidedly low-tech toys in this year's class, saying the simpler the toy, the more ways children find to use them.

'The toys that do all the laughing or singing or moving for you don't offer the child as much room to use his imagination,' she said.

A national selection committee made up of 24 experts, including toy collectors, designers and psychologists vote the winners in to the hall each year. 

Anyone can nominate a toy, but to make it through the preliminary selection process and become a finalist a toy must have achieved icon status, survived through generations, foster learning, creativity or discovery and have profoundly changed play or toy design.

'All kinds of stuff gets nominated,' curator Nicolas Ricketts said. 'People have nominated dirt, sofa cushions. Anything that someone has played with and had a good time with might end up being nominated.'
