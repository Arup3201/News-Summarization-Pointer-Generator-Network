Arsenal duo Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere enjoyed some time off after England's 3-1 victory over Slovenia by heading out to play a round of golf.

Their Arsenal club-mate Danny Welbeck scored a brace as Roy Hodgson's side came from behind in the Euro 2016 qualifier - Kieran Gibbs, Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also featured in the match while Theo Walcott and Chambers were on the bench.

Both Wilshere and Chambers posted pictures on Sunday while out playing golf, with the former revealing they had teamed up against Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Wilshere wrote: 'Bit of golf with the lads...me and @chambers1995 v @alexoxchamberlain and @Theo Walcott #GameOn.' 

Chambers then posted later on and revealed their game had ended in a draw. He said: 'Great game! Ended in a draw, may as well have played without my partner! #carried.' 

England's latest victory means they maintain their 100 per cent start to the qualifying campaign.

Hodgson's side are currently top of Group E after wins against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia.

Next up for the Three Lions is a trip to Glasgow where they face Gordon Strachan's Scotland in a friendly at Celtic Park.
