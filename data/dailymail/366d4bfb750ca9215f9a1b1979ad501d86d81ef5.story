A family butcher in the Scottish borders has come up with a new way to eat Creme Eggs - inside a Scotch egg.

Greig Foston and Benjamin Webb say their snack contains 1,000 calories - and is best served warm so the chocolate melts with the chilli-flavoured pork.

Foston's Fine Meats in the village of Duns, Berwickshire, Scotland, is now even planning to sell mini egg sausages to add to shop's Easter offering.

And for for just £1.85 you too could could enjoy the  Cadbury's Creme Egg surrounded by chilli flavoured sausage meat and covered in breadcrumbs.

Butcher Greig Foston explained: 'We always try to think up something new and exciting for the time of year - we try to get our thinking caps on.'

The 36-year-old continued: 'We came up with the sweet chilli in the sausage meat and the egg in the middle.'

Asked what people think of his latest culinary creation Mr Foston said:'It's pretty spilt.'

However locals seem keen to try something new. 'We made up a batch at the weekend,' he said, 'just to see what demand was like, and it sold out pretty quickly.'

He said around 75 per cent of the school children who come to the shop gave it the thumbs-up.

But the madcap meat-sellers are not resting on their laurels, and are working on a smaller version using a Mini Egg.

Mr Foston said: 'We've got another idea - Mini Egg sausages. Pork sausage with whole Mini Eggs - the little ones coated in sugar.

'That would work well, I think, with plain sausage meat, and letting the chocolate melt inside the sugar casings of the egg,' he continued. 

He said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark Wimbledon was also a great success. 

If you don't have the time to make chocolate from scratch, you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs.

Once your chocolate is melted, it will need to be tempered. The cooling down process will take some time but if you want to hurry things along, just pop your chocolate into the freezer (no longer than 30 seconds).

Place a stainless steel bowl over a bowl of hot water and add half of your chocolate to it. Keep aside the a quarter of the amount for the last bit of the process. 

Stir your chocolate so it melts - and remember to check the temperature.

Bittersweet/ dark chocolate should reach a temperature of 28C-29C;  milk chocolate should reach 27C-28C; and white or coloured chocolate should reach 26C-27C.

Once the first batch has melted, add more chocolate to your bowl, stirring as you go along. As soon as the correct temperature is reached, start building your Easter egg layers. 

Spoon some chocolate into a mould (you can get them from Lakeland, Denny Craft Moulds or Party Delights) and rotate it so the liquids coats the bottom of the mould. 

You can make it as thick as you like, building each layer as the previous one cools. 

Once the final layer has been built, leave aside to cool and harden before decorating.
