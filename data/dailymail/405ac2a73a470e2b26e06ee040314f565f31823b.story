A huge police search is underway for missing Durham University student Euan Coulthard, 19

A huge police search is underway for a university student who went missing yesterday morning after a night out. 

Euan Coulthard, a 19-year-old law student at St Mary's College, Durham, was reported missing by a friend yesterday afternoon.

Mr Coulthard, who is from Nottingham, was last seen leaving a nightclub alone in the early hours of Thursday morning.

The second-year 'model student' had been for an Italian meal on Wednesday evening to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday and went on to the Love Shack nightclub in the city centre. 

He has not responded to texts, emails or Facebook messages since leaving the club shortly after midnight, which is out of character, police said.

Mr Coulthard is 5ft 9in, of average build with light brown hair, which is short on the sides and longer on the top. 

When he was last seen he was wearing black skinny jeans, a denim jacket and a beige patterned shirt.

Around 200 students from Durham University met at 8am today to help search for Mr Coulthard.

Lee Murray, 18, also from St Mary's College, was among the search party. 

The sports student said: 'We have been out since around 8am, there's around 100 of us left but earlier on there was double that.

'We all want to do our best to find Euan, he is a lovely lad who is really involved in the college socials, he loves cricket and everyone speaks about how liked he is.

'It's so tragic. We're handing leaflets out to ask the if the people of Durham have seen Euan and if anyone has any information it would be appreciated.

'We came down to the riverside to see if we could even find his jacket, if he has gone into the water, we couldn't find anything.

'I just hope the police can do a better job. Everyone is devastated, especially his close friends and flat mates.'

Professor Simon Hackett, principal of St Mary's College, said: 'We were first told on Thursday afternoon that students were concerned they had not seen Euan and we did not hesitate to contact the police.

'Euan is doing exceptionally well in his degree, he is a model student and is heavily involved in the social aspects at St Mary's.

'He is a keen footballer and has an interest in cricket. He is well-liked and this is completely out of character for him.

'Euan's disappearance has affected the entire community at the university and staff are here to provide support for any student that needs it.

'We would love anyone who has any information to contact the police as it is a very distressing time for all at St Mary's and the university.'

Inspector Dave Coxon, of Durham Police, said yesterday: 'We have serious concerns for Euan's welfare as there has been no trace of him since the early hours of this morning.

'He hasn't responded to any attempts to contact him and his phone has not been traced.'

Anyone with information was asked to call 101.
