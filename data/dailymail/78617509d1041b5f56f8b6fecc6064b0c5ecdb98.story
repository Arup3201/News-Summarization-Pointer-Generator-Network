At Oaksterdam University, you're guaranteed a potent dose of education where an A-grade will leave you with a very different high.

That's because the California institution is the world's first cannabis university that devotes its time to the study and cultivation of the drug.

More than 15,000 students have already passed through its doors and now bosses are on a roll after two states de-criminalised cannabis this month in a big boost to the industry.

But you're mistaken if you think life at Oaksterdam - a play on the Dutch city of Amsterdam where cannabis has long been legalised - is just for dopes.

High-end education: Students attend a lecture at the world's first cannabis university where they are taught how to succeed in the lucrative marijuana industry which is worth an estimated $2billion this year

Toking a leaf out of his book: Bosses are confident of booming student numbers after two U.S. states de-criminalised cannabis this month in a big boost to the industry

Bosses see its classes as a window onto a legal lucrative business that's set to be worth more than $2billion this year.

Pupils are told 'we're farmers. Not drug dealers' and learn how to run a profitable cannabis empire selling to some of the drug's three million daily users.

Classes include legal advice, electrical engineering and horticulture.

One student, who did not want to be named, said: 'There's a lot more to cannabis cultivation than I ever thought.

Not going to pot: Life at Oaksterdam is not about hippies smoking and getting high all day

Changing attitudes: Cannabis was legalised in Colorado and Washington for medical and recreational use on January 1

Not suitable for dopes: Classes include legal advice, electrical engineering and horticulture to help students learn how to run a profitable cannabis empire

Raided: Authorities seized plants and equipment at Oaksterdam in 2012, but no charges were ever brought

'People
 think it's simple, but for indoor growing there's a lot of technical 
aspects, how to get the best use of the lights and the amount of water 
the plants need.'

He added: 'Of course we should have laws governing cannabis production, but like any other crop, to make sure no harmful chemicals or pesticides are used.'

Cannabis was legalised in Colorado and Washington for medical and recreational use on January 1.

In California, possession for medical reasons is legal under state law but illegal in federal law.

This discrepancy saw the authorities raid Oaksterdam in April 2012, seizing University Cannabis plants and equipment.

Growth area: With 20 states now allowing some form of cannabis production, the future is looking bright for Oaksterdam

In demand: Classes are held daily and there is a waiting list for courses

No charges were ever brought, but student numbers dropped and the University was forced to move to a smaller location.

Today however, enrollment numbers are booming, classes are held daily and there is a waiting list for courses.

With 20 states now allowing some form of cannabis production, the future is looking bright for Oaksterdam.

One student said: 'People have always smoked Cannabis and the country's laws have finally caught up.

'For those who get on the ground floor, they are going to make a lot of money. And what's more American than that?'
