As thousands of Muslims gathered to celebrate Eid al-Adha, the Islamic festival of sacrifice, Australian politicians pushed for unity and denounced bigotry.

An estimated crowd of 20,000 people gathered outside Lakemba mosque to celebrate the festival, marking the occasion with prayers and speeches.

The Labor leader told those outside the mosque that he understood that prejudice and ignorance had made some in the Muslim community feel isolated.  

'I am sure that from time to time you have to deal with the shouting of ignorant intolerance. These challenges have occurred before in Australian history,' he said.

'Just ask Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the Vietnamese boat people, even the Irish Catholics.'

Mr Shorten reinforced that the Muslim community had every right to have faith and pride in their heritage. 

Despite the mosque coming under threats in the wake of anti-terror raids, thousands were there to hear NSW Premier Mike Baird address the crowd as 'family'.

Premier Baird let the crowd know that he was aware that this year had been a trying time for many in Australia. 

'Let's be honest, over the past few days and months it has been a difficult time,' he said.

'In NSW we are one family: we have different faiths, we have different backgrounds but we are one family.'

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison made similar comments, praising Muslims who showed what was 'true and pure'.

'I commend those of faith here today who came together in spirit of peace and of unity,' he said.

'I assure you of the government's support of this community.'
