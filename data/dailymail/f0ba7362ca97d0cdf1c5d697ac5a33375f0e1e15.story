These unsuspecting birds very nearly got a right old soaking after they almost found themselves in the way of what appears to be a giant sneeze from this giraffe.

The quick-witted oxpecker birds however just about managed to get out of the way of the jet of drool fired in their direction by the giant animal.

The flying water is in fact caused because the giraffe, weighing around 187 stone, has to give its long neck a violent yank to lift it off the ground.

Giraffes, which can have necks nearly seven foot long, are very vulnerable to predators when drinking so must get their heads up quickly to see what's going on.

Unfortunately for the oxpecker birds, who groom the giraffe's body for parasites, it can mean occasionally getting soaked in drool.

The action shots were taken by photographer Arnaud Germain, 40, during a trip to Ol Pejeta Conservancy, northern Kenya.

The father-of-two, who works at British School in Alexandria, Egypt, said: 'I took the pictures during a weekend away with my family, my wife and my two children.

'We were driving around the park which is a great place that is trying hard to protect very endangered species.

'These giraffes were by the water hole and I stopped as I knew they wanted to drink. We waited a bit and they did come to the edge of the water.

Mr Germain said 'despite appearances the giraffe is not sneezing' - he said the animals always yank their heads back after drinking, which causes the droplets of moisture

Mr Germain said it can be a stressful time for the giraffe 'as they are very vulnerable'

'In fact despite appearances the giraffe is not sneezing. When giraffes drink, they always yank their head backwards when they rear back up and you can get nice pics of dribble.

'When this happens all the oxpeckers try and get out of the way as quick as possible.

'It is a very stressful time for the giraffe as they are very vulnerable, they could fall and they can't see predators so they are very cautious just before drinking.

'These giraffes are reticulated giraffes and they only live in northern Kenya.'
