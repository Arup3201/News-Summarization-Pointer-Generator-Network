Superclubs and fishbowls are being phased out by holiday company Thomson as it launches a new range of holidays aimed at young travellers who want a more classy trip abroad.

Thomson Scene is aimed at 18-35-year-olds keen something more sophisticated than boozing up and baking on the beach, and will eventually replace their current 2wenty concept.

'We are aiming at a young person who is, typically about two years into a new job, perhaps working in London and enthusiastic about trendy hotels,' said David Burling, UK and Ireland managing director for Thomson's parent company Tui UK. 

Thomson has launched a new brand that offers holidays to young travellers who want more than Magluf

New destinations include Goa in India and Santorini in Greece, though regular party locales will still be offered

The portfolio will be separated into 'Scene Hub' for the younger end of the spectrum with more affordable hotels in popular destinations, and 'Scene Style', for the more cashed-up travellers who want more trendy accommodation.

The move is a departure from the large, uniform, all-inclusive style hotels that are often offered as part of the company's portfolio for younger travellers.

The Club 18-30 concept was actually created by Thomas Cook, but has equivalents at various tour operators, such as the 2wenty concept from Thomson, which is being phased out in favour of Thomson Scene.

Young Britons' lurid behaviour in resort havens such as Spain's Magaluf was highlighted last summer with cheap dorm accommodation and even cheaper alcohol on the menu for most. 

Thomson is aiming at the market who wants more from their holiday with their packages now set to  include the Greek resorts of Santorini and Mykonos along with Croatia for short-haul trips. 

Long-haul destinations will include Thailand, Goa in India and Cancun in Mexico. 

Thomson Scene offers more trendy hotels than those currently included in their holidays

Despite the rebranding Thomson continues to supply holidays for 18 to 35-year-olds to party-scene hotspots  like Ibiza and Corfu and in total is providing breaks in 86 hotels in 34 resorts in 20 destinations.

The company's announcement came in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana where travel association Abta is holding its annual convention.

An Abta survey released today showed that three per cent of UK men had been on an overseas stag-party event, with men preferring city breaks for their stag dos while women opted for beach destinations for their overseas hen parties.
