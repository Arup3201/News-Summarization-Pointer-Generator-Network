Bastia president Pierre-Marie Geronimi has called for French League (LFP) president Frederic Thiriez to step down after he did not come down to the pitch to shake the players' hands ahead of Saturday's League Cup final.

'If you want to be president of a League with 41 clubs instead of 42, you must go,' Geronimi told RMC radio on Sunday.

'What happened last night [Saturday] is unacceptable. Sporting [Bastia] demands that he goes.'

Bastia lost 4-0 to Paris St Germain, who claimed their fifth League Cup trophy with doubles by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani.

In 2012, Thiriez did not hand Bastia their Ligue 2 champions' trophy.

Edinson Cavani was also among the scoring, and netted a brace for his side in their convincing victory
