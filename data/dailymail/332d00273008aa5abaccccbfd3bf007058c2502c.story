Scientists have used the remains of ancient chickens to prove that Columbus beat the Polynesians to discovering America.

The study of ancient and modern chickens has dismissed a previous study of chicken bones which had claimed that Polynesian voyagers reaching South America before European explorers.

The University of Adelaide's Australian Centre for Ancient DNA led an international team who looked again at bones from modern and ancient chickens - and believe it proves once and for all that Columbus did reach America first.

The study ends the dispute which had claimed Polynesian voyagers reached South America before European explorers.

The new study reveals that previous studies were probably based on contaminated results.

The results showed that the chicken DNA had a distinct genetic marker that is not found in modern South American chickens, which suggests that the Polynesian and South American people did not have much contact.

The research team used DNA extracted from modern chicken feathers and bones excavated from archaeological sites from islands including Hawaii, Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and Niue.

Many of the modern samples used were collected as part of a sailing expedition from the Philippines to the islands of Anuta and Tikopia in West Polynesia made by two replica Polynesian catamarans back in 2009.

Professor Keith Dobney, an Aberdeen University Scientist and co-author on the paper, joined the expedition sailing through the Solomon Islands and collecting hair and feather samples from domestic animals from remote island locations.

Professor Dobney said 'These modern chicken samples proved crucial to the study, helping us to identify and track the unique genetic signatures of original Polynesian chickens across the Pacific and revealing their origins in the Philippines.

'Our research at Aberdeen, with colleagues from across the world, involves studying a range of domestic and invasive animals that were moved by people in the past.

'We're using a range of techniques (including DNA) to test theories about where early human colonists of the remote Pacific came from, which routes they followed and whether they ever voyaged as far as the South American mainland.'

Project leader Professor Alan Cooper, Director of ACAD said: 'We were able to re-examine bones used in previous studies that had linked ancient Pacific and South American chickens, suggesting early human contact, and found that some of the results were contaminated with modern chicken DNA, which occurs at trace levels in many laboratory components.Â 

'We were able to show that the ancient chicken DNA provided no evidence of any pre-Columbian contact between these areas.

'Remarkably, our study also shows that the original Polynesian lineages appear to have survived on some isolated Pacific islands, despite the introduction of European domestic animals across the Pacific in the last couple of hundred years,' Professor Cooper says.

'These original lineages could be of considerable importance to the poultry industry which is concerned about the lack of genetic diversity in commercial stocks.'

Associate Professor Jeremy Austin, ACAD Deputy Director, said: 'There are still many theories about where the early human colonists of the remote Pacific came from, which routes they followed and whether they made contact with the South American mainland.

'Domestic animals, such as chickens, carried on these early voyages have left behind a genetic record that can solve some of these long standing mysteries.
