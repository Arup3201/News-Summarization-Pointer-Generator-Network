A woman of 24 who cannot conceive naturally must wait six years before she is eligible for IVF treatment on the National Health Service.

Andrea Heywood, a nursery nurse, was left infertile after a childhood illness.

When she and her husband Aaron applied for fertility treatment to their primary care trust, NHS Portsmouth, they were told that they would not be considered until she turned 30.

National guidelines suggest that 
women should be eligible for IVF from the age of 23, but this is not an 
obligation and each trust is free to impose its own restrictions, 
creating a postcode lottery.

The couple, who married three years 
ago, say they are the victims of age discrimination and that delaying 
treatment could reduce their chances of conceiving.

Mrs Heywood said: ‘It is bad enough 
not to be able to have children naturally, but this is like someone is 
saying, “No, you can’t have children – you have got to wait”.

‘I feel guilty for my husband because I am the one with the problem. I feel as if I have let him down.’

Mrs Heywood suffered severe scarring 
to her fallopian tubes at the age of six when her appendix burst, and it
was confirmed later that she was infertile.

The couple were bitterly disappointed
when they were turned down three times for a free round of fertility 
treatment worth £5,000.

They initially threatened to sue the 
trust in a strongly worded legal letter, but decided not to pursue their
case through the courts when NHS chiefs refused to back down.

Mr Heywood, 25, said: ‘We have just got to wait or find the money ourselves.

‘Some people might say it is not a lot of money to have children but it is a lot of money if you have not got it.

‘All our friends from school and college are having children now. So when we go round to see them it can be upsetting.’

The National Institute for Clinical 
Excellence (NICE) states that couples should be considered for free IVF 
between the ages of 23 and 39, and is considering expanding its criteria
for free treatment.

Recent draft guidelines recommend 
scrapping the lower age limit and suggest infertility should be treated 
as soon as possible because the chances of success decline with age.

The rationing body is also considering offering IVF to women aged 40 to 42, and extending it to gay and lesbian couples.

However, NHS Portsmouth provides free IVF only for women aged 30 to 34.

The couple’s lawyer, Louisa Ghevaert 
of solicitors Porter Dodson, said: ‘NICE guidance is not mandatory and 
it remains to be seen whether the new draft proposals will bring greater
recognition of IVF as a legitimate clinical need.

‘We need greater fairness in 
accessing fertility treatment on the NHS for couples like  Andrea and 
Aaron who are battling with the postcode lottery and varying 
restrictions imposed by PCTs, which continue to flout the guidance 
across the country.’

NHS Portsmouth was unavailable for comment.
