There should have been plenty to talk about at socialite Heather Kerzner’s 44th birthday party a few weeks ago.

It was held in a swanky London restaurant called Downtown Mayfair, and the guest list was eclectic.

Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and his new young bride Sally rubbed shoulders with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and their mother, the Duchess of York.

Even Bill Clinton’s former squeeze, Monica Lewinsky, was spotted doing the rounds. 

But, according to one guest, there was only one topic of conversation that night: what on earth was Donna Air, 33-year-old Geordie TV presenter, doing on the arm of 26-year-old cake entrepreneur James Middleton, brother of the future Queen?

Could Donna, daughter of a Newcastle builder and an HR manager, and with a child from a previous relationship, really have bagged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby brother?

As celebrity pairings go, this surely took the biscuit. Or the cupcake.

Could Donna, daughter of a Newcastle builder and an HR manager, and with a child from a previous relationship, really have bagged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby brother?

As one party guest noted, the pair didn’t much look like a natural couple: ‘She is pretty, though extremely thin, and obviously much older and more sophisticated than him. He is good-looking and tanned, but seemed a little dazed.’ 

As well he might. His friends believe he had no idea that going to a party thrown by extrovert Heather Kerzner, who is estranged from her second husband, 77-year-old hotel magnate Sol, would mean his new relationship with Donna Air, seven years his senior, would emerge blinking into the flash bulbs for all to scrutinise. 

Clearly, though, James appears to have conquered these early nerves about being seen with Donna in public. 

On Monday, the couple were pictured on a cosy daytime date in London’s Hyde Park, walking James’s dog and holding hands.

And they were pictured last week outside another London nightclub, Loulou’s in Mayfair, after attending a night out with James’s sister, Pippa, and her stockbroker boyfriend, Nico Jackson.

Again, Princess Beatrice and Fergie were also there. 

They have been dating for a few weeks since meeting in Robin Birley’s private members’ club, 5 Hertford Street in Mayfair, a favourite for well-connected Sloanes.

James only likes socialising at parties and private clubs where he won’t be watched by inquisitive members of the public. 

Aside from Pippa, to whom he is very close, James may be reluctant to introduce Donna to his family.

As one of his set put it: ‘James will be the only one of his friends to have been out with a Geordie, with someone who has a child, and who hasn’t been to public school.

'All his friends just date each other and each other’s sisters.’

Another was more blunt: ‘Given that the future monarch is going to spend his or her first weeks in the Middletons’ house, no one can quite imagine the reaction to Donna arriving on the scene.’

Indeed, Donna’s journey from child star of TV show Byker Grove to Highgrove is something none of his set can quite believe. 

At 26, James Middleton lives rent-free with Pippa in Chelsea in a flat bought by his parents.

He works for his parents’ party products website in Berkshire, as well as running his Cake Kit Company, which produces cake-making kits and novelty cakes.

(Cake Kit was in the red in its last accounts, but not, according to James, to a worrying degree.) 

Perhaps his business efforts leave him little time for romance, because, since the Royal Wedding, he has been hard to pin down romantically. 

A few girlfriends have come and gone, including a pretty Australian called Amy Bradshaw, from whom he split in 2010; an unnamed American interior designer who, like Donna, was a few years older than him and, apparently, broke his heart; and, finally, a Japan-based public-school-educated English model called Emily Steel. 

Like Donna, all were angular faced, leggy blondes. And, like Donna, some of them were not quite the conventional Sloane types that one might expect — and his mother Carole might desire. 

Donna’s romantic history is far more colourful than that of her younger beau. She had a long-term relationship with zoo-owning property and gambling millionaire Damian Aspinall, now 52. 

The heir to John Aspinall, founder of elite casino the Clermont Club, Damian was divorced with two children when they met. He and Donna never married, but have a daughter, Freya, now nine. 

The couple separated when Freya was four, with friends citing his reluctance to marry again as the reason for the split.

Aspinall runs Aspers, the casino chain, but his real love seems to be the gorillas who live in his family zoo, Howletts. 

Donna attracted controversy when she planned to let Freya, then a small baby, be handed into the gorilla cage at Howletts to be passed around by the dominant female, as her half-siblings had been. 

After the split, Donna moved on to a succession of older, richer men.

There was John Dorrance IV, the American London-based heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, whose wife had gone off with David Beckham’s best friend, Dave Gardner.

Donna said their relationship was ‘very serious’, but it didn’t last. 

After a brief flirtation with George Best’s son Callum, there was Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born millionaire who was accused of taking part in a giant VAT-dodging scam involving the sale of mobile phones. (The case against him was eventually thrown out.) 

As recently as November last year, Donna seemed happy on holiday with Goldstone, rubbing sun cream into his back in Barbados. But at the end of the year they split. 

James Middleton might not be Donna’s usual established multi-millionaire type, but he certainly has glamorous royal connections and the energy of youth.

Last year saw a few unfortunate headlines for Donna. She spent time in a wheelchair after a car crash damaged her ankle, and was then prosecuted for fraud when she was found to have two simultaneous parking permits for two different boroughs. She was later cleared.

Things perked up when her career portfolio was boosted with the launch of her children’s clothing range at Debenhams and an appearance in Tom Daley’s ITV diving show, Splash!, in January.

February was notable only for her opening a new branch of the discount fashion store TK Maxx in Newcastle.

Her website declares that she is a brand ambassador for companies like Next, Westfield and Cadbury’s and has edited organic cookbooks. Hers is a truly contemporary career path.

Donna has already offered us many thoughts on her idea of romance. For a while she wrote a dating blog called Donna’s Diary on a matchmaking website called eHarmony. 

Her advice included the following: you shouldn’t ‘reveal your killer dress until date number three at least’; the perfect date look is trousers, as you feel more in control; and that ‘a spray tan, a Wonderbra, a vodka and tonic, and high heels’ are the best ways to beat tiredness before a date. 

She also asked pertinent questions such as: ‘How do you duck someone’s tongue lunging towards you without being a total b***h?’ 

Just as Donna isn’t James’s only older woman, he isn’t Donna’s only toyboy either.

One online diary entry was entitled ‘Dating with an age gap’, and was an account of a night she spent with a 23-year-old male model ‘who clearly just want[ed] to get laid’. 

They went to Mahiki, the nightclub haunt of the young royals. Somehow, she avoided telling the model that she lived with her young daughter. She added: ‘But for the record, yes we did have a bit of a snog. Sorry, I couldn’t resist!’ 

She also expounded further on her ideas of love when she presented a TV programme that would surely turn Carole Middleton’s hair grey, entitled Fifty Ways To Tease Your Lover.

Her number one tip was to do a striptease. Dressing up as Star Wars’ Princess Leia also featured highly in her advice. 

Thankfully, James Middleton is no prude. Some of his novelty cakes feature captions such as ‘jiggly jugs’ and ‘yummy bums’, and many photographs still circulate on the internet of him semi-naked with his boxer shorts pulled down.

And while at first glance Donna and James might seem stratospheres apart, their sets do overlap.

She has many well-connected friends from her days on TV, and her relationship with Damian Aspinall saw her life evolve from Noel Gallagher’s Primrose Hill gang to Chelsea/Holland Park grandeur — a scene James is thoroughly comfortable in. 

His friends include society magician Drummond Money-Coutts, Old Harrovian Antonio del Balzo and PR girl Katie Readman. Both he and Donna know Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie well, and hop from charity event to PR openings on the social circuit.  

Although Damian Aspinall is believed — despite the fact they never married — to have provided for Donna to some degree, she can justifiably consider herself a self-made girl who planted herself in the middle of high society through sheer determination. 

In which case, should the relationship spark into full flame against James’s friends’ expectations, Carole might find she has more in common with Donna than she might think.
