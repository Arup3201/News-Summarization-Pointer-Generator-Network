Made with champagne and 23-carat gold, the world's most expensive loaf costs a lot of dough.

At a whopping £75 the royal bloomer has been made by Robert Didier at his Orchard Pigs bakery in Wrexham, North Wales.

Robert uses only the finest ingredients in his luxurious recipe replacing some of the water used in traditional sourdough breads with champagne.

The previous record is believed to have been £30 so Robert's loaf - which uses 23-carat gold in the dough and as decoration - smashes that figure.

Robert said: 'We wanted to create something unique and luxurious and the royal bloomer certainly does that.'

He adds: 'We use only the finest ingredients - so that's Welsh spring water and sea salt and we replace some of the water with champagne.

'The champagne gives the bread a delicious taste but you don't get much flavour from the gold flakes.

'They give the inside of the loaf a real sparkle and look fantastic on the top.'

Robert, who trained with legendary chef Raymond Blanc, got the idea after his previous attempt fell agonisingly short.

At three-foot-long, the royal bloomer is three times the length and three times more expensive than his previous attempt.

The chef said: 'We thought we'd broken the record a few months ago with our initial attempt.

'But at £25, we were a few quid short.

'We only make these loaves once a month and they are reserved for special occasions.

'It's gained a lot of interest and we're even shipped one over to New York for an event over there - its having to go special delivery.'

The royal bloomer was unveiled at the Hamper Llangollen food festival in the Dee Valley, North Wales, over the weekend.
