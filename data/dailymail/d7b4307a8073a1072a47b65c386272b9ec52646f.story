A machete-wielding thug is one of three more criminals to go on the run from open prisons over the Bank Holiday weekend.

Lewis Powter, 30, is serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection after  he used a 3ft knife to slash open the arm of his sister’s former boyfriend.

Police warned the public not to approach him after he absconded from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk.

Violent: Lewis Powter, 30, left, was jailed indefinitely after nearly hacking off a man’s arm with a machete. He is the second prisoner to escape from Hollesley Bay in two days after Paul Oddysses, right,  escaped on Saturday

Prison officers discovered he had escaped and sounded the alert when he failed to turn up for the 8pm roll call on Sunday.

Powter
 – who has a tattoo of Dennis the Menace on his right arm – was jailed 
in 2007 for the attack, during which he shouted that he was going to 
‘kill’ his sister’s former partner.

He
 used the machete to inflict a 10in gash on the elbow of his victim, who
 was left needing 28 stitches and a metal plate in his arm, Cambridge 
Crown Court heard.

Psychiatric and probation reports concluded that 
Powter posed a ‘medium to high risk’ to the public.

Missing: Wayne Mcleod went missing from Springhill Prison in Buckinghamshire on Sunday evening

On the run: Powter, 30, was being detained at Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk (pictured) but failed to turn up to the evening roll check on Sunday

He
 has a long history of  violence, and previously served an 18-month jail
 sentence for spraying a nightclub bouncer with CS gas. It is thought he
 could be in Cambridgeshire.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there will be 'no nonsense' over the naming of on-the-run criminals whose identities had been kept secret by Government officials.

Thirteen out of 18 missing convicts, whose identities had been withheld because Government officials believed it would be 'unfair' to publish them, have now been named.

Mr Grayling stated that data protection laws will not be used to protect them, arguing: ' They are wanted men and should be treated as such.

'That's why on my watch we will not hold back their names, unless the police ask us not to for operational reasons.'

It comes after a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mail to release the identities of missing prisoners had been rejected by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) - without considering whether it would be in the public interest to release the information.

The request was made after armed robbed Michael Wheatley - known as 'skull cracker' - absconded while on temporary release from an open prison three weeks ago.

Mr Grayling said: 'The police catch most of them quickly. Even so, I think the rules in open prisons have been too lax and I am tightening them.

'They'll be more stringent risk assessments, and anyone who absconds will get a longer sentence and will be banned from going back to an open prison.

'From the end of this year, we'll also use GPS tags to monitor where they are.'

He also suggested the number of people absconding from open prisons is a 'small fraction' of what it was ten years ago.

When
 he was last seen, about an hour before his escape, he was wearing a 
blue jumper over a white T-shirt, blue jeans and white Ralph Lauren 
trainers.

A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ‘Police are asking anyone who
 may have seen him or anyone with information about where he is to 
contact officers.

‘You should not approach him or take any further action.’

Powter
 was the second prisoner to go on the run from Hollesley Bay in less 
than 48 hours. Paul Oddysses, 49, who is serving a life sentence for 
attempted robbery and robbery with a firearm, absconded at about 12.30pm
 on Saturday.

He has a scar on the back of his head and tattoos on both arms, and has connections to Hertfordshire and Essex.

A
 third inmate, Wayne McLeod, 36, escaped from Springhill open prison in 
Buckinghamshire between 5.15pm and 8.15pm on Sunday. Thames Valley 
Police did not reveal why he was in jail but said he may now be in 
Reading, Berkshire.

News of 
the latest absconders will heighten public concerns about the series of 
prison breaks since armed robber Michael ‘Skullcracker’ Wheatley failed 
to return to Standford Hill open prison in Kent on May 3 after being 
allowed out. He has since been recaptured.

The
 Daily Mail yesterday revealed the identities of 13 criminals who went 
on the run between May 2010 and March 2013 after Justice Secretary Chris
 Grayling intervened to end the ‘nonsense’ of their names being kept 
secret.

A Ministry of 
Justice spokesman said Mr Grayling had ordered ‘immediate and major 
changes’ to tighten up temporary release processes and open prison 
eligibility.

The spokesman 
added that absconds had reached record lows under this Government and 
were 80 per cent down over the past ten years.
