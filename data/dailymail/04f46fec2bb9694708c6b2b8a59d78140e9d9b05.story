Bizarre and brilliant cosmetic treatments were big news in 2013 with the vampire facial, which involves drawing the patient’s own blood and then injecting it back into the face, topping the most requested list.

The facial, made famous by fans Kim Kardashian and supermodel Bar Refaeli, saw an 800 per cent increase last year and it seems that surgeons can't get enough of the bloody treatment.

So popular and effective has it become that cosmetic doctors are using the technique on patient's hair to help stimulate growth.

Famous fans: The vampire facial, which involves drawing the patient's own blood, separating the layer that is filled with platelets and then injecting it back into the face, is loved by Kim Kardashian, left, and Bar Refaeli, and now it is available for your hair too

The procedure, named Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP), is being used on the scalp as it can apparently stimulate dormant hair follicles and encourage them to start growing again.

It is a potential form of treatment for men or women who suffer with hair loss either through genetic predisposition, hormonal issues, trauma or alopecia. 

So how does it work? The treatment, which takes around an hour and a half, involves taking four syringes of the patient’s blood and putting it in a centrifuge (a rotating piece of medical equipment) to separate the plasma from the red blood cells - this is the same technique as PRP for the face. 

Local anaesthetic injections are then injected into the scalp, which will ensure the area is numb.

Effective: It takes around an hour and a half and involves taking four syringes of the patient's blood and putting it in a  rotating piece of medical equipment to separate the plasma from the red blood cells; it costs £1,300

The scalp is then stimulated with a dermaroller. Once the syringes are ready, the PRP is injected into the scalp - primarily in the areas of concern. 

The patient then has to use the dermaroller every day for around a month at home following the treatment.

Absolute Aesthetics Clinical Director Vicki Smith, who recently completed her training and has just started offering the treatment, said: 'It is quite common not to see any changes for six weeks and then you should start to feel the hair becoming thicker in the treated areas.

'The optimum results can be seen at three months. At this stage it is decided whether a second treatment is required or not.'

This treatment can be used as a standalone treatment or alongside a hair transplant procedure (usually one month pre-procedure).  

It is not widely available in the UK yet but Vicki Smith believes it will be big news. You'll have to start saving though because a single treatment will set you back £1,300.

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'PRP to treat hair loss has been championed by many surgeons quietly for the past few years, and studies underway are showing promising results that the procedure does stimulate the growth of new hair follicles.

'Patients should keep in mind that PRP is not be considered as alternative to a hair transplant, in fact the two procedures combined provide optimum results for thinning hair.

'The role of PRP in hair restoration is to stimulate inactive or newly implanted hair follicles into an active growth phase, and this treatment should be repeated (number of treatments will vary per case) during the re growth stage following the hair transplant.'
