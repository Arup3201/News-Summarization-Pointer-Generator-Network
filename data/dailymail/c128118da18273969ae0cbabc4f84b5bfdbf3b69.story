Ana Ivanovic and Donna Vekic took to the crease at Edgbaston to bowl the crowd over on Friday evening.

The tennis stars provided the half-time entertainment in the Natwest T20 Blast game between the Birmingham Bears and Durham Jets at Edgbaston Stadium.

Ivanovic and Vekic, who will be competing next week in the Aegon Classic at the Edgbaston Priory Club, just round the corner from the cricket ground, switched sports to go head-to-head at the wicket.

Serbia’s Ivanovic was the first to bowl, firing tennis serves at the Croatian 17-year-old, who was ‘not out’, thanks to some impressive shot-making with her racket.

Ivanovic then padded up at the crease and showed a natural flair with the bat, swiping away deliveries from the young Croatian, Vekic.

'It was great fun,' said Ivanovic. 'I only knew a little bit about cricket before today, but it was exciting to get out on the pitch. It’s fantastic to see everyone having a great time at the cricket. I hope they all come and watch us play at the Aegon Classic too.'

Vekic, who finished runner up during last year's Aegon Classic, added: 'It was very cool to play out there and wear the pads and all the cricket gear. I hit the stumps a few times in practice so I think I did pretty well!'
