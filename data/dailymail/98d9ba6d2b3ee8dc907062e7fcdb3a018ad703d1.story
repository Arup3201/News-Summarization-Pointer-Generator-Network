It is the world’s smartest desk - and can even ‘breathe’ to help improve your posture.

The £3,000 Stir Kinect desk has a motor to raise and lower itself, converting it into a standing desk or a traditional desk.

The desk can even be programmed to move up and down slightly, at the exact speed of a resting human heartbeat, making it to appear to take a gentle breath to remind the user to change their position.

Experts say that changing from a seated to a standing desk can improve productivity. 

Similar desks have become a common sight at tech firms such as Google, where some employees have even installed treadmill and bicycle desks.

The Stir Kinect desk was created by a team of ex-Apple and Disney engineers.

It has a built-in touchscreen to control and track movement, and can tell users exactly how many calories they burn by standing for part of their working day.

It also has compartments containing power points and USB ports for charging phones, to keep cables hidden.

‘Harvard Business Review called sitting ‘the smoking of our generation,’ said  JP Labrosse, founder and CEO of Stir, who was previously one of the team who created the original iPod at Apple.

The touchscreen can be used to set goals for how long a person sits and stands throughout the day, pictured left. The desk also comes with a Settings menu that controls the standing time, the clock and other presets

‘It’s also been shown that switching 
between sitting and standing can generate an extra fifty minutes of 
productivity each day,’ he claimed.

‘Our
goal with the Stir Kinetic Desk it to promote a working life infused 
with movement, leading to better health and improved focus.’

The
desk also features integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to allow for 
integration with third party fitness and wellness apps, and Labrosse 
told MailOnline the desk was just the first of a series of 'smart' 
office products from the firm.
