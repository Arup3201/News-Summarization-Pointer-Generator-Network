Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS

Accused rogue trader Kweku Adoboli sobbed in court today as he insisted he did not act fraudulently while working at UBS.

Adoboli, 32, is accused of gambling away £1.5billion of the Swiss bank's money and wiping £3bn off its share price while working at its London headquarters.

Prosecutors claim the trader ignored financial controls, including trading limits, and invented phantom transactions to disguise his 'naked gambling' from bosses in order to boost his ego and career prospects.

It is alleged he was 'intimately aware' of how UBS's trading controls worked after moving from the back office to trading floor and was able to play the system a result.

But Adoboli hit back at allegations he took advantage of his knowledge of the bank's inner workings today, saying he just wanted to 'do my job to the best of my ability'.

He said: 'It was the ability to understand the interaction of systems and accounting processes that allows you to do your job.

'It is not fraudulent; it is finding a way to do your job.'

He told the court he did not believe his 'rare skillset' had made it 'easier' for him to exploit the bank.

'The reality is systems and processes evolve, number one.

'Number two, the reality is every single trader, and salesperson, trade support advisor, and settlement person has a duty to understand the system, the tools that we use.

'So I do not think it is fair to say that my experience in settlement and trade support enabled me to more easily do something that has been characterised as fraud.

'Those experiences enabled me to do my job to the best of my ability.'

In an at times emotional start to his evidence Adoboli wept twice when asked about his father, who sat in the public gallery, and his 'mentor' at UBS Mike Foster, the former head of the ETF desk.

Mr Justice Keith told him he should not be embarrassed as it gave the jury a chance to 'see the man behind the name'.

Adiboli described UBS as his family, adding: 'Every single bit of effort I put in to that organisation was for the benefit of the bank, the people around me, and the book I worked on. The bank for which was so proud to work.

He told the court he had begun to trade off the book in a bid to generate enough profit to offset annual $40m losses being made by the ETF desk.

He said that for three years from 2008 to 2010 the desk had lost £24m, and that in the first six months of 2011, before his arrest, it had lost £12m.

The trader said the losses had come about from balance sheet costs, client execution costs, dividend slippage, and being unable to hedge certain equities.

Adoboli said his life had become overcome by his efforts to make the ETF desk profitable.

He told the jury he had missed his grandmother's funeral because of the work he was putting in to his job.

'Every moment of every day spent thinking about "How do I make this book work?".

'Nothing else was important enough to overcome that.'

He said that through his constant market-watching he had begun to develop a 'gut instinct' for how it would move.

Adoboli told the court that when he spoke to John Hughes, his 'supervisor and go-to person' he was 'not really interested' in off-setting the losses.

'He said: 'You begin to have to consider if I was committing a fraud because I was doing it for my own benefit, ultimately, my intent in every trade I was doing was to generate profits which would offset the costs which we could not find a way to hedge.

'In the process of doing so I began to learn more and more about how the market worked.

'I was growing more confident in my ability to call the market, to understand what might happen next in the market.

'As a result of that extra confidence by the end of 2009 I had made £3.5m profit for the book.

'My end goal was to generate £24m of profit that I could then release in to the book to offset the costs that I thought the book would incur in the period of a year.'

Adoboli went on to deny the prosecution suggestion that he was a 'gambler'.

He
said: 'It's not "I will just do a gamble on the market because that's 
fun" and the outcome I will hide away in a cash trade, absolutely not. 
Actually the cash trade is the end goal.'

He
said the 'Umbrella', which prosecutors have suggested was a secret 
'slush fund', was nothing more than an 'accounting mechanism' to help 
the ETF desk offset its losses, adding that his colleagues Hughes, Simon
Taylor, and Christophe Bertrand, were all aware of its existence.

Adoboli
went on to describe Mr Foster, who left UBS before the period in which 
Adoboli is alleged to have begun his fraudulent activities, as having a 
'lot of strong relationships' and being 'good at managing' both him and 
his desk colleague John Hughes.

After Foster left, Hughes took over as 'supervisor' of the ETF desk, said Adoboli, leaving two young men in charge of a '$50bn book'.

Hughes, who gave evidence earlier in the trial, was described by Adoboli as 'quite maverick' and 'gung-ho'.

He said: 'He did not really care about the book as a whole. He cared about being profitable as a trader.'

Adoboli worked in the back office at UBS from September 2003 until December 2005 when he was employed as a trader.

In September 2006 he was moved to the global synthetic equities division on the exchange traded funds (ETF) desk buying and selling ETFs, which track different types of stocks, bonds or commodities such as metals.

At the start of today's hearing two additional charges of false accounting were added to the indictment.

Mr Justice Keith, outlining what he described as the 'sensible reasons' for adding the charges, told the jury: 'It's been decided to add two additional counts to the indictment.

'Those additional counts do not add to the allegations which have already been made against Mr Adoboli.

'They have been inserted to clarify the allegations which are being made.'

Adoboli, from east London, denies two counts of fraud by abuse of position and four counts of false accounting.

The case continues.
