A pensioner who killed her husband of 50 years after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer claimed today that it was an act of mercy.

A court heard Sheila Sampford plead guilty to strangling her husband 82-year-old John, who was dying from leukaemia, at their home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.

But she insisted that her motive was to end his pain, and must now face a separate hearing to determine if the murder was indeed an act of mercy.

Tragic: The home of Sheila Sampford and her 
husband John, who was terminally ill with leukaemia when she strangled 
him to death there on July 5 last year, before telling police she had
 done so as part of a suicide pact

Mr Sampford was found dead on July 5 
last year. His wife was arrested the same day and told detectives his 
death was as a result of a suicide pact.

Sampford appeared at Luton Crown Court by video link from Peterborough prison, where she is being held on remand.

After entering her guilty plea she was told there would have to be another hearing to decide if it was indeed a mercy killing.

Neil Moore, prosecuting, told Luton Crown Court: 'The issue that arises in this case is whether she believed this killing was an act of mercy.'

John Price QC, defending, said: 'The only matter is whether he asked her to do what she then did to him.'

Mr Sampford was terminally ill with leukemia when his wife of 50 years strangled him to death at their home in the Bancroft Park area of Milton Keynes. 

Euthanasia, a Greek-derived term meaning 'good death', is where a patients agree to allow another person, usually a doctor, to end their lives. It has been the focus of much controversy in recent years.

Although it and assisted suicide have become accepted ways to die in some European countries and American states, both practises remain illegal in Britain.

Judge Richard Foster ordered a separate hearing to determine the facts of the case before passing sentence.

Murderers automatically receive a life sentence, but if Sampford's actions were motivated by mercy it could affect how much of that she must spend in prison before being freed on licence.
