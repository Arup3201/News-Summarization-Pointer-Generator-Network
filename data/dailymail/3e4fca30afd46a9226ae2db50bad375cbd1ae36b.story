Britain’s families are set to face a hike in the cost of popular fish and chip meals, according to a new report.

Food industry experts are warning that the price of fish and chips are about to go up as cod prices are on the rise as a result of tightening supplies and soaring demand.

Commodity analysts Mintec reported yesterday that the price per tonne for wholesale Norwegian cod has leapt by 25.7% year on year to £1,060.

Mintec analyst Mark Kozlowski said that increased demand, particularly from China, and a drop in supply - fuelled in part by a 10per cent reduction in the Barents Sea quota - has led to a sharp price rise for cod.

With Norwegian cod accounting for around 20% of cod consumed in the UK, he warned that the current stock situation could lead to ‘tighter supplies’ with potential price increases being felt by Britain’s consumers.

Mr Kozlowski told trade magazine The Grocer: 'Prices in Norway will indirectly influence cod prices from other producers.'

But the report says that cod is not the only fish and seafood species to experience price rises with the price of Norwegian coldwater prawns soaring by 57% to £2,387 a tonne over the past 12 months with lower Canadian quotas leading to a tightening of supplies across the market.

However, The Grocer says that British consumers are unlikely to have to start paying more for prawns any time soon as most of the prawns sold in the UK are warmwater prawns and prices for those are falling.
