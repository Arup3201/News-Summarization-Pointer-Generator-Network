A sailor has been shot dead on a guided-missile destroyer while docked at a Virginia naval base and security forces killed the suspect in the aftermath.

The names of the sailor and the suspect have not been released while the Navy contacts their families.

The suspect was a civilian who had access to be at Naval Station Norfolk, spokeswoman Terri Davis said early Tuesday.

She said she couldn't say whether he had permission to be on the USS Mahan, where the male sailor was shot about 11.20pm Monday.

No other injuries were reported, and the base was briefly on lockdown, according to the Navy.

Davis would not describe any other circumstances of the shooting but said the scene was secure.

Operations have returned to normal at the base, with counselors available, the Navy said in a news release.

Regardless
 of the shooting, most enlisted sailors on the Mahan — docked at the 
first of 13 main piers — were not to report to duty Tuesday. Base 
traffic was typical Tuesday morning.

The
 shooting on the Mahan comes about a month after the Navy held 
anti-terrorism and force protection exercises on bases around the U.S., 
including an active-shooter drill at the Norfolk station.

To
 get on the base, civilians must be escorted or have a pass. Each base 
entrance is guarded, and all 13 piers have additional security forces. 
As part of ongoing security efforts, handheld ID scanners were 
implemented this year at Navy bases in the region, including the Norfolk
 station.

The shooting comes
 six months after a September incident at the Washington Navy Yard, in 
which a gunman — identified as a contractor and former Navy reservist — 
killed 12 civilian workers before being shot to death.

The
 Norfolk base covers more than 6,000 acres and is the home port for 64 
ships, according to information the Navy provided in February. About 
46,000 military members and 21,000 civilian government employees and 
contractors are assigned to the base and its ships, according to the 
Navy figures.

Earlier drills: The Norfolk Naval Base just ran anti-terrorism drills last month that included an active-shooter drill (guards pictured at the base entrance in 2004)

The base also is the home port for a Navy hospital ship, docked at Pier 1 with the Mahan.

In
 February, the Norfolk base got a new commanding officer, Capt. Robert 
E. Clark Jr. He took over for Capt. David A. Culler Jr., who was set to 
retire in May. Clark had served as the installation's executive officer 
since 2012.

The Mahan, 
commissioned in 1998, has a crew of nearly 300. In September, it 
returned to Norfolk after a deployment of more than eight months that 
included being positioned in the eastern Mediterranean Sea for a 
potential strike against Syria.
