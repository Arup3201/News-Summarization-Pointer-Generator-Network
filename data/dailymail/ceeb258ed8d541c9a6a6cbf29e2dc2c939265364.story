Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it was ‘simply foolish’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the UK was a thing of the past

The British public has become ‘disturbingly’ complacent about the terror threat, the spy watchdog has warned.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it was ‘simply foolish’ to believe that the risk of a terrorist attack on the UK was a thing of the past.

On the eve of the anniversary of the July 7 bombings in London in 2005, Sir Malcolm warned jihadi extremists were deploying 'devilish technical skill' to create ever more sophisticated devices.

Passengers arriving at airports in Britain, the Middle East and Africa face extra security checks to fly into the US after warnings an attack was being planned.

It follows claims Islamic extremists are making explosives which are undetectable to airport scanners, by using smartphones or tablet computers.

Sir Malcolm, who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures, said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary.

But he warned some people have become too complacent about the threat, because there had not been a successful bomb attack since 2005 when 52 people were killed by four bombers on tube trains and a London bus.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Malcolm rejected claims that a new round of stringent security checks were not needed.

‘Long queues work their way through security, our clothes are removed, our luggage inspected and our own bodies often examined. As of this week it has got worse, especially for flights to the United States,’ he wrote.

‘Is it really necessary? We have seen no planes hijacked for many years. None have exploded in the air, like the PanAm flight over Lockerbie in 1988.

‘Apart from the terrible murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, the last successful Islamic jihadi terrorist outrage in Britain was the London bombings back in 2005.

‘This has resulted in complacency amongst some of the public which is seriously disturbing. It is simply foolish to believe that the threat is either minimal or now behind us.’

Sir Malcolm said it was 'foolish' to think that because there has not been a successful bomb attack in Britain since July 7. 2005 that the threat had receded

The latest security measures imposed last week followed intelligence warnings that al Qaeda's chief bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, who is thought to be based in Yemen, had linked up with jihadists in Syria to pass on his skills.

Meanwhile Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State - formerly Isis - appeared in public before his followers to lead prayers at the Great Mosque in Mosul in northern Iraq where the extremist group has made sweeping gains.

brahim Al-Asiri, 32, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners.

The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights from the UK.

The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from 10 to 21 on Friday.

Sir Malcolm, who disclosed that he had been briefed in advance about the measures, said that he had been left in no doubt that they were necessary.

'I have received fuller information than it has been possible to publish in the newspapers. I have no doubt, from what I have learnt, that these new steps are not bureaucratic nor an overreaction . Sadly, they are unavoidable,' he wrote.

Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, has insisted that the each year the security services have intercepted serious plots which ‘would have led to the deaths and mutilation of many British citizens’, Sir Malcolm added..

'The police and the security services have been very successful but we must not underestimate the devilish technical skill of those terrorists who design ever more sophisticated means of concealing explosives in mobile devices, in clothing and in otherwise innocent objects. They have been hard at work over the last year.'
