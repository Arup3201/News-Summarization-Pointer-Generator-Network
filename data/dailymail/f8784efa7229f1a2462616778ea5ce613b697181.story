A Texas A&M football star, his stepbrother and an incoming member of the University of Utah football team have been killed as their SUV rolled over after they apparently drove on little sleep.

Polo Manukainiu, a freshman lineman at Texas A&M, and Gauis Vaenuku, who was joining the Utah Utes this year, died in the crash on Monday evening on U.S. 550 just north of Cuba, New Mexico.

Manukainu's stepbrother, Lolo Uhatafe, 13, also lost his life and in the crash, while Lolo's older brother, Salesi Uhatafe, and father both sustained minor injuries.

In a tragic twist, Manukainiu's last tweet read: '22 hour drive back to Texas on no sleep. Oh my.'

Tragic: Texas A&M University football player Polo Manukainiu, 19, has died in a rollover crash in New Mexico

State Police said that Manukainiu, 19, 
and Vaenuku, 18, were passengers in a 2002 Toyota Sequoia, which was carrying five people in total, as it traveled 
southbound on the highway.

The vehicle drifted off of the road and the driver, believed to be Salesi Uhatafe, over-corrected, and the car rolled several times.

Manukainiu and Lolo Uhatafe were ejected and died at the scene. 
Vaenuku was transported from the scene but was pronounced dead in an 
ambulance.

The two others - Salesi and his father, Salesi Sr. - were treated for injuries. Manukainiu was the stepbrother of Salesi and Lolo Uhatafe.

New Mexico State Police Sgt. Emmanuel Gutierrez confirmed that the crash occured after 'driver inattention or fatigue', KSL reported.

Officials said alcohol 
wasn't involved and it appeared the driver was the only one wearing a 
seatbelt, authorities said.

The tragedy came as the men were driving home for the final weekend before boot camp started for the upcoming season.

Manukainiu graduated Trinity High School in Euless, Texas in 2012 and went to Texas A&M to play.

The
 6 ft 5 player, who was a recreation, parks, and tourism sciences major,
 was expected to make contributions on the field in the upcoming season.

'We lost a terrific young man,' Texas 
A&M head football coach Kevin Sumlin said. 'Polo was loved by his 
teammates and coaches. Anyone who came in contact with him was struck by
 his sense of humor and smile. My heart aches for his mom and family 
members.'

The other victims of the crash graduated high schools in Euless this year and were also football players. In February, Vaenuku had signed to play defensive end with the University of Utah.

Utes
 coach Kyle Whittingham said in a statement: 'Everyone who knew Gaius is
 heartbroken today. He was the kind of young man who lit up a room and 
his future in football and life had no boundaries.

'Words
 cannot express our devastation over the loss of Gaius. This is a sad 
day not only for University of Utah football, but for everyone whose 
lives Gaius crossed or would have crossed but for this tragedy.'

Heartbreaking: Before the crash, he tweeted that they were driving from Utah to Texas 'on no sleep' - and friends urged them to pull over and sleep. Police suggested the crash was caused by fatigue

Friends and classmates have taken to social media to mourn the young men.

'Heart hurts waking up to news about Polo.. I think I speak for everyone on our team when I say we love you brother you will be missed,' A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel tweeted.

'I still can't even believe this. My heart just feels empty right now. Rest in Peace Polo. We love you big dog,' A&M athlete Matt Davis wrote.

'Woke up this morning truly 
heartbroken...i can't believe it man. I was just with you in the locker 
room on Friday talkin bout camp...' Forrest Valayka added.

Texas A&M finished last season ranked No. 5 after an 11-2 season, their first in the Southeastern Conference.

They
 were led by quarterback Johnny Manziel, who became the first freshman 
to win the Heisman Trophy, and are expected to be highly ranked again 
this year.
