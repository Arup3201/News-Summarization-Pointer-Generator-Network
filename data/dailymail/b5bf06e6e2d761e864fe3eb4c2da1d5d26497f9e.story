The central cast of Friends all went on to achieve continued success in Hollywood, and it seems the same goes for one of the show’s cutest characters.

The white-throated capuchin monkey who played Ross’s pet Marcel just landed a Mario Testino photo shoot for Allure magazine, alongside Kendall Jenner.

The primate, who is in fact a female called Katie, perched on the reality star turned model’s shoulder and sat in her arms as she posed in a series of cut-out swimsuits.

Katie certainly acted like a pro, staring at the camera and even showing off an endearing head tilt.

And Kendall, 19, was clearly a fan of the monkey, telling the magazine during her accompanying interview that she loves animals.

Katie was born in 1993, two years before the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star.

Capuchins can live until the age of 45 or older in captivity, but their life expectancy in the wild is between 15 and 25 years.

Fact: Kendall Jenner is a mega babe. But just in case anyone, anywhere needed any more proof. These pictures should put the matter to rest.

Shot by Mario Testino for Allure magazine, Kendall looks amaze-ing as she poses up a storm in a series of sexy swimsuits. And her perfect accessory? That adorable monkey!

We love her cut-out one shoulder Versace number in the image below, but this slashed Agent Provocateur number is our fave. Obviously it's a mega hot piece to wear around the pool, but you could also team it with skinny jeans and killer heels for a banging after-dark look.

So with that in mind, why not stand out out from the rest and click right to get yours? Or, see our looks for less below from the likes of Missguided and ASOS? Or splash the cash with this designer ViX's number at Bloomingdales.

The animal appeared in eight episodes of Friends, during the first and second seasons, along with her double Monkey. 

Sadly, David Schwimmer wasn't as much of a fan of his on-screen pet as his character Ross Geller was.

‘I hate the monkey,’ he told Entertainment Weekly in 1995. ‘I wish it were dead.’ 

David explained that he wanted to be able to get to know the animal, adding: ‘The trainers won’t let me bond with it. They’re really, really possessive. It’s like, “Land on your marks, do your job, don’t touch or bond with the monkey.” It’s a bummer.

Big fan: The 19-year-old model, who was shot by Mario Testino, told the magazine that she loves animals

And Matthew Perry, who played Chandler Bing, told TV Guide: ‘The monkey doesn't know he's on TV. He isn't going to perform perfectly every time, so they're going to use the take where the monkey gets it right.

‘It didn't matter what our performances were like. If the monkey got it right on the first take, that was the one they used. The monkey also ate live worms. And then he'd vomit constantly.’

Katie and Monkey (born in 1988) additionally starred in Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, George Of The Jungle, Flinstones II: Viva Rock Vegas, Outbreak, Addicted To Love and Instinct.

Not really Friends: Sadly, David Schwimmer said in 1995 that he 'hated' the monkey and wished 'it were dead'

Animal A-lister: Katie went on to become the Rally Monkey for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim baseball team

They also appeared in commercials for Bud Light, Diet Coke, Pepsi, McDonalds, Doritos, Sony and Yahoo.

Katie later became the unofficial mascot, or Rally Monkey, for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball Team.

The two capuchins are owned by Nerissa Politzer and were trained by Mike Morris of Bob Dunn’s Animal Service.

Nerissa told People in 1995: 'If Monkey was human, she’d be Meryl Streep.'
