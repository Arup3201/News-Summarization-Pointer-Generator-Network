Anger: Chief Secretary to the Treasure Danny Alexander said there was no 'sense' behind the figures

Scotland receives more than £1,600 extra per head than the English, exposing the massive benefits they enjoy by being part of the Union.

New national statistics published yesterday showed the glaring disparities of public spending ahead of next year’s independence referendum.

England is short-changed to the tune of three per cent a year per person, while Scotland gets 16 per cent more spent on it than the UK average.

Northern Ireland gets a massive 24 per cent extra spent on it proportionately and Wales 10 per cent compared to the UK average.

Every Scots gets £10,152 spent on them, compared to £8,529 for the English, £9,709 for the Welsh and £10,876 for those living in Northern Ireland.

The UK average spend per head is £8,788 - £1,364 more than the Scots.

Those in living in the South East of England lose out the most. They get just £7,638 per head of public spending.

Londoners, in contrast, have a healthy £9,435 splurged on them which the Treasury put down to the higher infrastructure and wage costs.

A breakdown of the different policy areas show that Scots enjoy £307 per head spent on housing, while the English get just £138.

Scots also get more than twice as much spent on them than the English on economic development: £992 per head compared to £469.

Spending on health is £1,912 per person in England compared to £2,115 in Scotland, where prescriptions are free.

Education is another area where Scots get more resources - as well as not paying university tuition fees. Some £1,441 is spent per head on education in Scotland compared to £1,360 in England.

Scots, who enjoy free personal care, have £1,857 spent on them for social care and pensions, compared to £1,652 for the English.

The figures were seized on by UK ministers who argued that they showed the advantage Scotland gets from being part of the Union.

Chief
Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: ‘These figures 
demonstrate that the people of Scotland continue to see a real financial
benefit of over £1,300 per person compared to the UK average. The UK 
remains the most successful economic, and political, union in history 
and Scotland is one of its greatest success stories. It makes no sense 
to put this at risk through separation.’

The generous funding package stems from the controversial Barnett formula, which was based on population, rather than need.

However
council bosses in England and Wales this week called for the ‘unfair 
competitive advantage’ handed to Scotland to be scrapped.

Scaremongering: The SNP said Scots per head paid more tax - if North Sea Oil revenue is counted

The Local Government Association said the UK Government should dump the 34 year-old Barnett Formula.

But the SNP accused the UK of scaremongering and not taking into account that Scots per head paid more tax - if North Sea Oil revenue is counted.

Annabelle Ewing, the SNP MSP said: ‘The best of both worlds is an independent Scotland in charge of own abundant resources, and a relationship of equality with the rest of the UK.

‘A No vote would be the worst of all worlds because it would be a green light for the Treasury to slash Scotland’s budget and the services we all depend on. ‘

She added that politicians south of the border were ‘itching to impose even harsher spending cuts in Scotland’.

A spokesman for pro-UK campaign Better Together said: ‘These figures underline the fact that we have the best of both worlds here in Scotland.

‘We have a Scottish parliament making decisions about our health, our education and our police, and we have the strength and security of being part of the United Kingdom. Devolution works. Independence would end it and would be a huge leap into the unknown.’

The Scottish Government will next week release its white paper on what an independent Scotland would be like, should Scots vote to break away from the UK in next September’s referendum.

Future: The Scottish Government will next week release its white paper on what an independent Scotland would be like

But Scotland’s Advocate General, Lord Wallace of Tankerness will say in a speech today FRI that the ‘real challenge to the Scottish Government [is] to what extend will the white paper own up to the uncertainties which would inevitably flow from a ‘Yes’ vote in a referendum’.

Scotland’s membership of NATO and the European Union would have to be renegotiated and Scotland may even be deprived of using the pound as its main currency.

Switching to a ‘needs-based’ formula would give England more than £4 billion extra a year to spend, the LGA said. That would amount to around £94 more per head for the English, £103 more for the Welsh, while Scots would be stripped of £846 and Northern Ireland would lose £516 per person.

The First Minister of Wales this week also signalled he would veto the so-called sterling zone if Scotland voted for independence.

In an article for the Scottish Daily Mail, Carwyn Jones wrote: ‘It is highly unlikely that currency union without strong fiscal controls could work, there would be too much uncertainty, it would slow down decision making and the risk to Wales and Northern Ireland would be far greater - so it would only be right for the views of the rest of the UK to be heard.

‘Given the experience of the Eurozone in recent years, and the uncertainty which surrounded the various bail-outs, then I am not convinced that a shared currency would work from the Welsh perspective.’
