Australians lucky enough to own property in one of the nation's major capital cities are sitting on a gold mine, if new figures on soaring house prices are anything to go by.

RP Data figures released on Tuesday show the full extent of Australia's steep capital city house prices, led by Sydney, which is clearly ranked the nation's top place to own a house.

In the 12 months to June this year, house prices in the nation's largest city rose 15.4 per cent, which in dollar terms means it now costs buyers an average of $690,000 to purchase house.

Vaucluse, like Bondi, also has a reputation for being an expensive suburb with this house selling for $19 million

Buoyed by record low interest rates, a lack of availability and high demand, Sydney had gains of more than five per cent on Melbourne, the next nearest capital city with 9.4 per cent growth, and was 5.4 per cent higher than the national average of 10 per cent.

A house in Sydney, based on the latest figures, costs double the price of a home in Hobart which recorded just 2.5 per cent growth. The average price of a Hobart home is just $328,250. Â

However, according to some economists, the soaring rise in house prices has peaked and the market can now expect to see a drop-off in the next financial year.

CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said a rise in the amount of available housing should stop house prices getting too steep. 'It is likely that increases in land sales, healthy building approvals and solid new home sales will result in a greater supply of homes over 2014,' he said.

Mr Sebastian described the increase in house prices over the past year as 'phenomenal.'

'The pent up demand for housing, low vacancy rates and strong rental yields have increased the attractiveness of property as an investment class,' he said. 'In addition, substantial cuts to interest rates continue to drive activity.'

RP Data research director Tim Lawless agreed, declaring house prices peaked in August last year and since that time said the 'rate of capital gain has generally trended downwards.'

St George economist Janu Chan said house prices will continue to keep gaining, but at a more moderate pace.'Affordability constraints and less attractive rental yields for investment may start to deter some buyers,' she said.

'This should leave the RBA content to leave official cash rate settings on hold for the remainder of the year.'
