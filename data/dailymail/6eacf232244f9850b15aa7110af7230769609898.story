He's famous for championing British design and for being a fan of a well cut suit but it seems David Gandy has simpler tastes when it comes to skincare.

Instead of facials and Botox, Gandy, 33, says he relies on rosehip oil after being handed a bottle during a shoot in Australia.

'I take 90-odd flights a year so my skin is constantly dehydrated,' the model revealed. 'An Australian make-up artist gave me her rosehip oil and it just seemed to do wonders.'

Dermatologist Ole Henriksen says more men want good skin and will use products like A'kin's oil (above)

The oil, which is sold by Australian organic beauty brand A'kin and costs £18, contains a high concentration of Omega nine, six and three, as well as essential fatty acids - all of which make it intensely hydrating.

While Gandy might be unusual in his taste for rosehip oil, male grooming in general is becoming increasingly popular, with 54 per cent of men feeling under pressure to take care of their skin, according to a recent study.

Men now spend more than more than ever on looking good every year, while 33 per cent admit to using hair removal products, nine per cent saying they wear foundation and 11 per cent applying fake tan.

Interestingly, the last figure appears to be borne out by the Beautiful Britain 2013 report - an annual survey of 2,600 salon beauty professionals commissioned by Salon Services.

Despite Gandy's popularity with the ladies, perma-tanned TOWIE star Mark Wright was found to be the celebrity behind the grooming efforts of more than a fifth of male clients.

Fans: Justin Timberlake and Hugh Jackman both use OLEHENRIKSEN products to keep their skin lovely

'What I have noticed is that men no 
longer are afraid of saying "I care about my looks.",' explains Danish 
dermatologist Ole Henriksen, who counts Justin Timberlake and Hugh Jackman among his fans.

'They want to look hot for their wives, girlfriends, or partners in life. Men have been made aware of the negative consequences that can happen if they don’t take care of their skin – it can become dry or uncomfortable, leathery, or sun damaged. So, they take pride and invest in taking care of their skin.

He added: 'I always tell my male clients to keep 
their skin care routine simple so that they don’t feel overwhelmed.

'One 
important aspect of their simple routine is to invest in at least one or
two anti-aging products for night time use, since skin is at rest and 
the regenerative powers are working in top gear.

'I do feel that it is important that a man does not aim to look 
like a male Barbie doll – it’s all about natural, healthy skin with 
flexibility and a good tone – expression lines look good in a man’s 
face.'
