A woman has launched an online petition asking Kmart to give its employees Thanksgiving Day off so that her mother can spend the holiday at home with her family.

After the company announced plans to keep its stores open for 42 hours straight, from 6am on Thanksgiving straight through until midnight on Black Friday, Jillian Fisher, 25, called for the retailer to give its employees – including her mother – a chance to spend at least some of the holiday with their families.

'We understand that it is retail, and employees understand that they have to work hours on holidays. However, Kmart’s unnecessary hours are forcing its employees to miss out on important time with their families,' wrote Ms Fisher, who lives in Wilmington, Delaware.

Controversy: One daughter has launched a petition asking Kmart to give employees time off on Thanksgiving Day, so that her mother won't have to spend the holiday working. An employee at a New York City Kmart is shown on Black Friday three years ago

'With lives that are continuously busier and busier, it is more important now than ever to put an end to this before we no longer have holidays.'

Since posting the petition Wednesday night, she has already garnered 1,250 out of the 2,000 signatures she's seeking.

Ms Fisher told MailOnline that, while she has not yet received a response from Kmart, 'the response from Kmart employees has been very positive.' 

'Employees, as well as non-employees, are expressing that it is enough that we have Black Friday, and it shouldn't ruin the time we have with our families on Thanksgiving.' 

Speaking to ThinkProgress, Ms Fisher added that her mother, who has worked for the retail giant for 21 years, hasn't even been told whether she'll be required to work on the holiday this year, but revealed that last year’s Thanksgiving sales saw her working not one, but two separate shifts at her local store.

'She was not going to be able to spend any real time with our family. To hear her on the verge of tears really infuriated me, to think why are they doing this to people, they need time to be with their families,' she recalls.

'This is the one holiday where the whole family gets together: her mother’s brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces. Thanksgiving is pretty much the one time of year we all get together.' 

Ms Fisher’s petition has already received support from a number of current and former Kmart employees, many of whom share her anger and frustration.

'I used to work at KMart, and missed MANY holidays with my family. It is NOT volunteer work, it is required. They are ridiculous and should be ashamed at themselves for trying to make money on Thanksgiving! Let people be with their families!' wrote Chrissy M. 

Although Black Friday is generally regarded as the biggest date on America's shopping calendar, recent years have seen other stores begin their sales on Thursday night.

Macy's and Kohl’s have previously led the way for promotions to start early - opening on Thanksgiving rather than Black Friday.

However, some leading retailers have announced that they will not open on Thanksgiving amid anger that traditional time at home is being lost to shopping.

A Facebook page called Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving and various other online petitions were formed to stop shopping on the holiday, and stores such as Costco and Nordstrom will now close so that staff can enjoy the day with family.
