'The juvenile rode out of the driveway directly into the path of the oncoming Honda,' said a report released by the California Highway Patrol which was obtained by KTLA. 

The driver of the car then 'applied her brakes but was unable to stop prior to colliding with the juvenile.'

The driver stayed on the scene and was not taken into custody.

The boy's godmother, Kathy Barnes, was still having trouble dealing with the tragedy.

'I just think people need to be a little more mindful, especially in neighborhoods,' she said. 

'This is a neighborhood. Kids live here.'

As for Martinez, she said that the young boy was a 'really good kid' who was 'always happy' and had a 'good sense of adventure.'
