In July Nasa will take a portrait of Earth from a satellite probe orbiting Saturn - and is hoping people will wave at the night sky at just the right time.

Nasa's Cassini probe has been in orbit around Saturn since October 1997 and has previously managed to capture only a handful of blurred images of Earth as it travels around the ringed planet.

Yet due to a rare solar eclipse scheduled to take place next month, the probe's cameras will be able to take a clear image of our planet without the sunlight causing damage to its sensitive equipment.

Nasa's Cassini probe has been orbiting Saturn for almost nine years. It has previously taken photos of Earth, pictured in the top left-hand corner, but Nasa hopes a solar eclipse scheduled for July will mean the probe can take the clearest shot of the planet to date

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft was launched in October 1997.

It was supposed to last four years but is still fully-functioning and orbiting the ringed planet. 

When Cassini was launched it orbited several planets, including Venus, Earth and Jupiter before getting a speed boost from the gravity of each planet that propelled it towards Saturn.

It went by Venus in April 1998 and June 1999, Earth in August 1999 and Jupiter in December 2000.

It regularly passes by the moons of Saturn collecting new data and sending these discoveries back on Earth.

Cassini weighs nearly 12,600 pounds and has radioisotope thermoelectric generators (nuclear power) on board. 

It will also be the first time Nasa is telling 
people exactly when the photo will be taken in the hope they will
 want to be a part of the event.

Cassini imaging team leader Carolyn Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado said: 'My sincere wish is that people the world over stop what they're doing at the time the Earth picture is taken to revel in the sheer wonder of simply being alive on a pale blue dot of a planet.

'And to appreciate the ever-widening perspective of ourselves and our world that we have gained from our interplanetary explorations.'

Nasa has said the photo will be taken between 21.27pm and 21.42pm GMT (5:27pm and 5:42 p.m. EDT) on 19 July.

However, anyone who takes part shouldn't get their hopes up about being seen from space.

Earth is 898 million miles away from Saturn and will appear as a tiny bright dot next to Saturn and its rings.

North America and part of the Atlantic Ocean will be pointing towards Saturn at the time the picture is taken.

This image, snapped in 1990, was the first ever photograph showing of our solar system. It was taken by Nasa's Voyager 1 ship and Earth can be seen as the small dot, highlighted by the arrow

Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California said: 'While Earth will be only about a pixel in size from Cassini’s vantage point 898 million miles away, the Cassini team is looking forward to giving the world a chance to see what their home looks like from Saturn.'

With this advance notice, we hope you'll join us in waving at Saturn from Earth, so we can commemorate this special opportunity.'

The Cassini team have chosen the 19 July because it will be able to take advantage of a rare total eclipse of the sun from Saturn.

Another artist's impression shows Earth's proximity to Saturn. Earth is around 898 million miles away from the ringed planet and will appear as a single pixel in the image Nasa plans to take in July

The spacecraft's sensitive cameras can then turn toward Earth without suffering any damage from the sun's rays.

'Ever since we caught sight of the Earth among the rings of Saturn 
in September 2006 in a mosaic that has become one of Cassini's most 
beloved images, I have wanted to do it all over again, only better,' said Porco.

'And this time I wanted to turn the entire event into an 
opportunity for everyone around the globe, at the same time, to savor 
the uniqueness of our beautiful blue-ocean planet and the preciousness 
of the life on it.

'It will be a day for all the world to celebrate.'

The space agency plan to use the probe to photograph Earth in July and is asking people to stop and wave at the night sky when the shot is taken

Photos will be possible because a rare solar eclipse between the Sun and Saturn will shield the sensitive camera from damaging rays
