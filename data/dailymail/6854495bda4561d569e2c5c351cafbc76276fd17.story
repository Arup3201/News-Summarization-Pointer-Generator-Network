North Korea will free 75-year-old Australian John Short after the Christian missionary made a grovelling apology for 'insulting' North Koreans by 'secretly' spreading the gospel, CNN reports.

In a written apology read out by Short, he said he realises his distribution of religious material was 'an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law' of the harsh regime of dictator Kim Jong-un.

Short, a South Australian missionary with the Global Hall Bretheren, was arrested last month and faced up to 15 years in a harsh North Korean prison.

Previously arrested for evangelising in China, Short, who is a Hong Kong resident, was taken from his Pyongyang hotel the night after he arrived in the North Korean capital.

His wife, Karen, said he knew the risks but 'when you know what you must do, you do it'.

'God called and he went â€” being a Christian we read our Bible and we believe that is our guidance,' Ms Short said following her husband's arrest.

The state-run Korean Central News Agency reported today the Democratic Republic of North Korea (DPRK) regime had agreed to free him.

'The relevant organ decided to expel him from the territory of the DPRK, thanks to the tolerance of the law of the DPRK and in full consideration of his age,' the agency reported.

The agency said Short 'committed a criminal act by secretly spreading his Bible tracts around a Buddhist temple in Pyongyang' after entering the country as a tourist, and published a written apology.

'I now realise the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people on February 16th because I made the Korean people angry and for this I truly apologize,' Short has allegedly written.

'I realise that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law of the DPRK.

'I request the forgiveness of the DPRK for my actions,'

'Hostile act': Australian missionary, John Short, will now be expelled from North Korea after making a grovelling apology for committing the 'hostile' act of spreading the gospel, which his wife Karen (pictured, right, with her husband) said he felt he had to do because 'God called' him

Short has been arrested multiple times in China 'for speaking out about brutality against Chinese Christians,' according to a biography on a religious website, Gospel Attract.

In the 1990s, he became 'persona non grata' for almost two years and was unable to visit mainland China, Gospel Attract said.

Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities.

Washington has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns about his health. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge.

Bae, 45, was widely reported to have been conducting missionary work in North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of the secretive country.

North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities.

The regime 'considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,' a United Nations panel said in a report released last month.

'People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,' the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.
