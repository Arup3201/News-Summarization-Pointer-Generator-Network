The FBI has joined a desperate hunt for a 12-year-old girl who was last seen leaving home to walk half a mile to school on Tuesday.

Jasmine Leighlin Baker waved goodbye to her parents and left their home in Perry Hall, Maryland at 7.30am to walk to Perry Hall Middle School, where she is a sixth grader.

When she failed to return home after school at around 3pm on Tuesday, her mother called the school but she was told the girl had been absent that day.

'She's a child, she's just a baby,' her mother Tina told WBAL as she pleaded for her daughter's return. 'If anybody knows anything or if somebody has her, or if she sees this, she needs to know that everybody loves her.'

Where is she? Jasmine Leighlin Baker, 12, has not been seen since Tuesday morning when she waved goodbye to her parents and started the half a mile walk to school - but she never arrived

Her father Robert told reporters that nothing seemed amiss when she left on Tuesday morning.

'She just left for school, everything was fine,' he said. 'She said goodbye to her mother, told her she loved her - and never made it to school.'

Her mother also expressed her anger that the school had not told her sooner that her daughter had not turned up for classes.

'It would really be nice to know sooner rather than later,' she said. 'I found out that my child was absent from school because she didn't come home from school.' 

Fears: The girl's parents, Tina and Robert, appealed for the public's help in finding the 12-year-old girl

Search: A missing poster shows more images of the young girl, who is a sixth-grade student

They said she usually leaves their home on the 4200 block of Soth Ave and takes a left on Deborah Ave before crossing Joppa Road to the back of school property - a walk that is just half a mile.

Friends and community members have handed out fliers to passing motorists.

FBI spokeswoman Amy J. Thoreson said the agency is putting up billboards around the Baltimore region with details and a photograph of the missing girl.

The case is also being investigated by the Baltimore County Police Crimes Against Children Unit. 

'Somebody knows where she is,' Cpl. John Wachter of the Baltimore County Police Department told WBAL. 'We just need that person to call us and let us know so we can take her home.' 

Nearby: Perry Hall Middle School is just a few streets away from the family's home in Nottingham, Maryland

Police added that no Amber Alert was made after the girl disappeared because they do not have any evidence she was abducted.  

She is described as white, 5-feet-5 tall and 175 pounds. She has blue eyes and long brown hair with blond and red streaks.

Investigators say she was last seen wearing blue jeans and a brown jacket. 

Anyone with information is asked to call the Baltimore FBI at 410-265-8080 or the Baltimore County Police Department at 410-307-2020.
