Paul Curry, of San Clemente, California, allegedly murdered his wife Linda Curry in 1994 with nicotine, ABC News reported. 

Curry, 57, had a new job and new wife in Kansas when authorities arrested him in 2010, where he 'was living off a $400,000 insurance payout from Linda Curry's death,' the news site reported.

Did he do it? Paul Curry, 57, is accused of killing wife Linda Curry with a nicotine injection in 1994

The Los Angeles Times reported in 1995 Linda Curry had been poisoned.

Speaking to the newspaper, Paul Curry said at the time 'I'm not convinced that she died from nicotine poisoning.

'I'm not convinced that this diagnosis is any different from the long list of others that we got before she died,' he continued. 'They were all wrong.'

Curry also said he was 'researching everything about nicotine to understand how it could've killed her.'

The Orange County Register, reporting in 2010 on Curry's arrest, said authorities from both the sheriff's department and the district attorney's  office worked together.

Sgt. Yvonne Shull told the newspaper the night Linda Curry died, 'It was only her and him' in the couple's home.

'When (Linda) Curry was given this dose of nicotine, she would have lived only a few hours,' she also said.

Ebrahim Baytieh, a prosecutor for Orange County, told CBS Los Angeles at the time 'Nicotine is one of the strongest poisons available. '

'I think in his mind he felt she was worth more to him dead than alive,' Baytieh also said.

The Metropolitan News-Enterprise reported 'Witnesses said that before she died, she claimed that she was afraid her husband might kill her for insurance money.'

The newspaper also revealed, citing a witness' testimony, Paul Curry allegedly pressured Linda to up her insurance policy to $1.4million, 'which she did not want to agree to.'

ABC News reported that jurors are being selected in the murder trial.
