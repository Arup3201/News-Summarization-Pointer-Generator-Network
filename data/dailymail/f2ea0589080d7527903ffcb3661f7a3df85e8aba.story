These spell-binding pictures bring a whole new meaning to the term freeze frame.

They look like painstakingly carved ice art that even the most experienced sculptors would be proud of.

But take a cold, hard look and you will see they are in fact tiny natural ice formations, captured in minute detail.

Andrew Osokin has captured stunning images of ice formations and snow using macro photography.

The 43-year-old from Moscow captures the beauty of frozen water in its crystal-like form.

He takes to the street and focuses his lens on what he finds and the result is an endlessly fascinating series of unique structures.

He explains: 'I appreciate the beauty of nature so the idea of photographing icicles was the perfect subject for me.'

Using Nikon D-80 and D-90 cameras and special lenses, Andrew braved the Russian cold to capture what he found in the Moscow environment.

'Pictures are not made in the studio, on the street in the frost,' he says.

Once the liquid is completely frozen, the sharp tip of the drop attracts water vapor in the air, much like a sharp metal lightning rod attracts electrical charges.

The water vapor collects on the tip and a tree of small ice crystals starts to grow, as seen above.
