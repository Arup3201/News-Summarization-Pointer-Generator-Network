More than half of people who saw George Osborne’s Autumn Statement think it was bad for them, a new poll reveals.

In a blow for the Chancellor who unveiled a raft of populist giveaways, 60 per cent thought it was good for ‘rich people’.

It comes after warnings from the official economic watchdog that despite better than expected growth figures, forecasts for rises in wages have been slashed for the next five years.

Mr Osborne used his yesterday’s Autumn Statement to unveil a raft of upbeat data pointing to the recovery gaining momentum, with record numbers in work, borrowing falling and house prices forecast to soar by 5.2 per cent next year.

The economy is forecast to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from just 0.6 per cent forecast in March.

The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts a dramatic increase in house prices, up 3.2 per cent this year, 5.2 per cent next year and an eye-watering 7.2 per cent in 2015.

But it also downgraded forecasts for wage rises, with average earnings in 2013 now expected to grow by 1.5 per cent compared to 2.1 per cent predicted in March.

It found that wages will be outstripped by the RPI rate of inflation which tracks rises in prices for years to come.

Battle: Chancellor George Osborne clashed with 
Labour's Ed Balls over figures showing growth is up, but ordinary people
are not feeling the benefits

George Osborne has said the UK must recapture the ‘pioneering spirit’ of the industrial revolution if it is to secure firm long-term growth out of the fledgling recovery.

The Chancellor said it was crucial the mistakes of the recent past - with over-reliance on particular sectors and areas of the UK - were not repeated but there were lessons to be taken from the country's history.

He was touring digger builder JCB's factory in Staffordshire off the back of the company's £150 million investment announcement to expand and create new jobs.

He said the Government was committed to investment in young people and apprenticeships to tackle youth unemployment, and on taking the ‘difficult decisions’ building big new infrastructure projects like new roads, and the High Speed 2 north-south rail link (HS2).

He added: ‘Hundreds of years ago our country was prepared to invest in railways and other big projects - our country needs that pioneering spirit again.’ 

Average earnings will be below RPI until 2015, the year of the general election, when both are expected to rise by 3.3 per cent.

It
means that people will not start to feel better off until 2016, and 
means that real wages will have fallen by 5.8 per cent in real terms 
from 2010 to 2015.

A snap poll of voters by IpsosMORI 
after Mr Osborne delivered his statement reveals public unease about 
feeling the benefit of the recovery.

More
than half of people surveyed (56 per cent) say they watched the 
statement or heard about it on the TV or radio or read it online.

Of
those who had seen it, 60 per cent said it was good for ‘rich people’, 
55 per cent said it was bad for ‘poor people’ and 51 per cent thought it
was bad for ‘people like me’.

Mr
Osborne clashed angrily with Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls in the
Commons, with Mr Balls considered to have put in a dire performance 
after his grim warnings of the impacts of austerity were proved wrong by
the latest figures.

Mr Balls turned red in the face as he struggled to be heard against a wall of noise from Tory MPs.

Mr
Balls was greeted with a roar of derision from across the House when he
claimed that it was the Chancellor who was ‘in complete denial’ about 
the state of the economy.

But the poll reveals voters think Mr Balls called it right, even if he left some Labour insiders despairing with his delivery.

The
poll asked which politician  voters agreed with most: ‘Ed Balls who 
says George Osborne is in denial about the cost of living crisis’ or 
‘George Osborne who says his long-term plan for economic recovery is 
working’.

Some 40 per cent agreed with Mr Balls, while only 24 per agree with Mr Osborne.

Gideon Skinner, head of political 
research at Ipsos MORI, said: ‘The Conservatives have seen their ratings
on managing the economy rise in line with general optimism about the 
economy. 

‘However, many 
people also feel that the growth in the economy is not benefiting their 
own standard of living, and this is reflected in the finding that 40 per
cent agree with Ed Balls that George Osborne is in denial about the 
cost of living crisis.

‘But 
these are people’s initial reactions – there is still time for them to 
change as they digest the Autumn Statement - and in particular the 
media’s interpretation of it.’

Official forecasts by the Office for Budget responsibility show how wage rises will be outstripped by increases in living costs

In the Commons yesterday the Chancellor said he wanted to secure a 'responsible recovery to allow the Government to live within its means'.

By 2018 the government is on course to have stopped borrowing money and even post a surplus.

It is a dramatic about-turn from the 
Budget in March, when the Office for Budget Responsibility slashed 
growth forecasts and warned there would be no new jobs this year.

The OBR said 400,000 more jobs would be 
created in 2013, and unemployment forecast to fall from 7.6 per cent 
this year to 7 per cent in 2015, and 5.6 per by 2018.

Most strikingly it now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4 per cent this year, up from 0.6 per cent it predicted in March.

It is the highest in-year increase since 1999 and makes the British economy the second fastest growing in the developed world.

The
OBR said government spending as a percentage of GDP will fall from 23.2
per cent in 2009 to just 16.1 per cent in 2018-19, ‘the lowest on 
record going back to 1948’.

To
loud cheers in the Commons, Mr Osborne said: 'This country is working 
through its long term plan, bringing down the deficit and dealing with 
the debt. Spending less on welfare and making the big decisions on 
infrastructure.

'Living within our means and cutting tax on business. Making work pay and letting people keep more of what they earn.

'Confidence
in the next generation, as they make their way in education and in the 
workplace. This statement shows the plan is working. It’s a serious plan
for a grown up country.

'But
the job is not done. By doing the right thing, we’re heading in the 
right direction. Britain’s moving again... let’s keep going.'

Mr
Osborne took aim at Labour's claim that it was a 'fantasy' that the 
private sector could create more jobs than those lost in the public 
sector.

'Businesses have 
already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector and 
the OBR report forecasts this will continue with 3.1million more jobs 
being created by businesses by 2019, more than offsets the one million 
or so reduction in the public sector.'

Chancellor George Osborne may have difficulty in making his Budget sums add up, a leading economic think-tank has warned.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies said he was relying on 'uncertain' revenues from a crackdown on tax avoidance and an increase in the bank levy to fund a series of giveaways in his Autumn Statement yesterday.

Mr Osborne told MPs that the measures he had set out were "fiscally neutral" - leaving the overall level of projected Government spending unchanged.

However, IFS director Paul Johnson said the Chancellor's cuts in fuel duty, employers' National Insurance contributions and business rates, and his introduction of a tax break for married couples would cost the Exchequer around £2.5 billion a year.

The increase in the bank levy is only expected to raise around £500,000, while the new anti-avoidance measures are slated to bring in an 'inevitably uncertain' £1 billion - leaving a £1 billion shortfall.

At the same time, the Treasury is assuming that the £750 million a year cost of the Liberal Demorcats' free school meals for five- to seven-year olds will be swallowed up into the 'overall spending envelope' from 2016-17 - which would mean even deeper cuts in other spending.

'The Chancellor continues to make specific promises on spending increases whilst stating that he will keep total spending at the same level. He can't keep doing that,' Mr Johnson said.

'Whilst the costs of his tax cuts are pretty definite, the benefits from his anti-avoidance measures, and indeed of the increase in the bank levy, are rather less certain.'
