Gary Lineker knows a thing or two about scoring, so when he made public his thoughts on Olivier Giroud it was with numbers in mind.

‘Playing in front of Arsenal's midfield,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘Should guarantee a minimum of 25 goals a season, for a striker of note. Alas....’

The man who won the Golden Boot at the 1986 World Cup believes the silver service laid on by Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere, to name the starters against Besiktas, is of such quality Giroud should top the scoring charts.

Instead he is producing adequate, not impressive, totals and it is a point that goes to the heart of Arsenal’s ambitions for this season and indicates why Arsene Wenger must act again in the transfer market if their title credentials are to avoid falling away like every other recent season.

Against Besiktas, Giroud was limp, wasting his team’s best chances to the fury of fans never shy to voice opinions on social media. His Bambi-on-ice attempt at a finish when put in by Sanchez’s delicate dink was illustrative of someone short on confidence but also provided further evidence he lacks that killer instinct possessed by Europe’s elite.

That, for a club of Arsenal’s aspirations, is some concern given he is now 27 and in the prime years of his career. Despite standing 6ft 3in tall he is not a striker to bulldoze defences, nor one to race through them either – his pace too limited.

Instead he scores his goals through craft and guile, often after smart interchanges with a supporting cast that moves like a carousel. In his first season after his £12million move from Montpellier in 2012 he found the net 11 times in 34 Premier League matches. Last season he scored 16 in 36 Premier League games.

Giroud's heat map against Besiktas

These are not insubstantial returns for the sum paid but, as Lineker highlighted, when assisted by a midfield of the calibre Wenger has assembled they shrink. Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott, for example, did not even feature in Turkey.

Last season Giroud started well, scoring five goals in his first six games in all competitions for Arsenal, but experienced a barren spell of two goals in 12 games – a brace against Southampton – throughout November and December.

Then in February compromising pictures emerged of him enjoying a late-night hotel rendezvous with a woman who was not his wife. He issued an apology to his family and supporters and six goals in 12 Premier League games followed but he did not appear to play with the energy of early season.

Hinging too much on that incident would be foolish, though. The deeper worry with Giroud is that he is simply not top level – as his exploits against England’s elite clubs shows.

In 23 matches against Manchester City, United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Everton and Tottenham since his arrival at the Emirates, he has scored three goals – two against Spurs and once against Brendan Rodgers’ team.

It is a record that should ring alarm bells for Wenger. He must be aware of the need to spend serious money on a central striker who would guarantee goals and actually scare defences at the high end of the league. Giroud does not have that fear factor.

Radamel Falcao and Edinson Cavani are two such forwards, available this summer, who would deliver both. Their prices are exorbitant but Wenger has shown with deals for Ozil and Sanchez he will splash the cash on proven talent. If that then means winning the Premier League title the cost would be instantly repaid.

For sale: Monaco's Radamel Falcao is another frontman that is up for grabs

Signed: June 2012 for £13million

2012-13 - Games 47 Goals 17

2013-14 - Games 51 Goals 22

2014-15 - Games 3 Goals 1

Total: Games  101 Goals 40

Giroud averages a goal ever two-and-a-half games for Arsenal 

You suspect, though, that Wenger still has not entirely shrugged off his habit for stubborn persistence with budget options – in the belief he can improve players and maintain financial equilibrium among his squad. 

Giroud firing Arsenal to the title would mean that much more to him personally, however unlikely.

It is the same for Yaya Sanogo, the 21-year-old Frenchman bought for nothing last summer. He started against Crystal Palace and was fine but no way near the striker Arsenal need with Champions League and cup runs desired too. Sanogo had a promising pre-season but still has not scored a competitive goal for Arsenal in 15 appearances.

Joel Campbell, the Costa Rica striker, has been on the bench and it seems Wenger does not wholly trust him yet. There is little competitive rivalry to spur Giroud on.

In years gone by Wenger has been able to call on an awesome lineage of scorers; Ian Wright, Dennis Bergkamp, Nicolas Anelka, Thierry Henry, Robin van Persie. These were strikers who would conjure three points with a flick of their boot and win titles.

Giroud, sadly, is destined never to be added to that list. Unless Wenger acts, Lineker’s words are set to linger.

Loic Remy - QPR striker has seen an £8.5m move to Liverpool fall through this summer but could yet be offloaded to anyone who can meet his wage demands. Scored 14 goals during a loan spell at Newcastle United last season.

Edinson Cavani - Wenger is a big admirer of the Paris Saint-Germain striker, who scored 25 times last season, but he certainly wouldn't come cheap. 

Mario Balotelli - Wenger won't admit his interest in the AC Milan striker but Arsenal are definitely interested. Balotelli could move on as Milan don't have Champions League football this season. The striker wants £150,000 net in wages each week though.  

Falcao - Not linked with Arsenal yet but certainly available. Scored 19 goals for Monaco last season and will perform in a superior league. Liverpool are also keen.
