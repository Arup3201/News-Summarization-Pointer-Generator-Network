French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has suggested the 35-hour working week is not sacrosanct and said the nation needs to be re-started to 'fire on all cylinders'.

His controversial comments came ahead of a 
government-commissioned report to be unveiled next Monday on proposals 
to boost the flagging industrial competitiveness of Europe's second 
largest economy.

However, only hours after his comments were published, Mr Ayrault's own labour minister dismissed the suggestion, and leading trade unions also voiced their opposition too.

All cylinders? French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault 
has suggested the 35-hour working week is not sacrosanct and said the 
nation needs to be re-started to 'fire on all cylinders'

The 35-hour working week was first adopted in France in February 2000 under Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Plural Left government.

The previous legal duraction of the working week was 39 hours, established by François Mitterrand.

The 35 hours is the legal standard limit, after which further working time was to be considered overtime.

The aim was to reduce unemployment and stop some people working long hours while others were unemployed.

It was also aimed at giving workers more time to enjoy their lives.

The law has always rankled with the right but when Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in 2007 he was content to tinker with the legislation rather than scrap it.

The shift to a shorter working week was the 
flagship reform of the Socialist government that ruled France during a 
boom at the end of the 1990s.

Many employers say it bloated labour costs
and blunted their ability to compete in world markets. 

Asked if it could make sense to revert to
a working week of 39 hours, Ayrault told Le Parisien newspaper: 
'Nothing's taboo. I'm not dogmatic ... The only thing that worries me is
that France has broken down and we need to restart with the engine 
firing on all cylinders.'

Ayrault, whose five-month-old 
government has been criticised for a string of communications gaffes, 
clarified his remarks after business and union leaders seized on 
them as signalling a major policy shift.

'I
said nothing was taboo. But this is simply not a cause the government 
advocates. There will be no rolling back on the 35-hour week because it 
is not the cause of our difficulties,' he told French radio.

Laurence
Parisot, head of the Medef employers federation, had earlier hailed 
Ayrault's initial comments as 'excellent news' while trade union leaders
were up in arms.

'If the 
government tries to take on the 35-hour week, it will run into us on the
road,' Francois Chereque, head of the large CFDT labour union warned.

The
gradual introduction of the shorter working week was intended as a 
socially progressive move and to encourage employers to hire more staff 
by making higher overtime costs kick in after an employee had worked 35 
hours in a given week.

Nicolas
Sarkozy, the conservative president unseated in May by Socialist 
Francois Hollande, offered overtime tax breaks to lessen the impact of 
the measure but did not try to repeal it.

Ayrault stressed the Socialist government had no plans to change the current working week.
