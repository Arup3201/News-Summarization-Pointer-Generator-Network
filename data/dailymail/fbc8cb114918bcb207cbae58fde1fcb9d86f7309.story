Former NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb was released Thursday from an Arizona jail after serving a one-day sentence for a DUI arrest late last year.

Records released by West Mesa Justice Court show McNabb served his time Wednesday and was released about 1:30 a.m. Thursday.

McNabb, 37, was arrested Dec. 15 in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community east of Phoenix, according to court records.

Star: McNabb played 13 years in the NFL after being drafted with the second overall pick in 1999

A copy of the citation shows McNabb was stopped on the Loop 101 freeway just after 3 a.m. and radar clocked his Range Rover at 81 mph in a 65-mph zone. He also was cited for DUI, but no information about blood-alcohol level was on the citation.

McNabb pleaded guilty on March 27 and nine days of his sentence was suspended.

Court documents show McNabb was ordered to pay a nearly $1,500 fine and enter an outpatient treatment program in Scottsdale from April 10 to July 8.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office released McNabb's mug shot Thursday morning, starting a media frenzy about his arrest, which hadn't been previously reported.

The agency later said in a statement that McNabb was booked into a detention facility on Wednesday by order of the West Mesa Justice Court and released after serving one day for a misdemeanor DUI charge.

McNabb's Phoenix-based attorney Stephen Benedetto didn't immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment on the case.

The former quarterback joins a long list of professional athletes who have been convicted of DUI in the Phoenix valley - and who've spent time in the jails run by Maricopa County's infamous Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has gained notoriety by implementing modern-day chain gangs and making jail inmates sleep in outdoor tents.

It's unclear whether McNabb served his time in the 'Tent City' jail complex - where the majority of DUI offenders are placed -- or at one of the county's other facilities, like the cushy complex in suburban Mesa that is often referred to as the 'Mesa Hilton' because it is where Arpaio often places celebrities, friends and political allies who find themselves on the wrong side of the law.

Other notable athletes busted for DUI in Arizona include former NBA star Charles Barkley, former baseball star Mark Grace and boxing legend Mike Tyson.

McNabb played for the Washington Redskins in 2010 and Minnesota Vikings in 2011 before retiring. He currently co-hosts a sports talk radio show and has a home in the Phoenix area.
