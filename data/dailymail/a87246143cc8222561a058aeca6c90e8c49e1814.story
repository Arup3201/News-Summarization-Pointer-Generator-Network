Prince Harry and the wounded servicemen and women he is trekking to the South Pole with got a warm send off for their gruelling charity race today.

The 29-year-old royal and his team of adventurers were at London's Trafalgar Square before the start of the 208-mile Walking With The Wounded challenge.

The group are due to fly to Cape Town, in South Africa, on Sunday before moving on to Antarctica two days later.

Although
he has always been the 'action man' of the royal family, Harry's 
participation in the challenge is one of his toughest tests yet.

Harry, who will take time off from his job as an Apache helicopter pilot in the Army Air Corps to compete, will be part of a five-strong team of Britons

He told the Walking with the Wounded departure event the expedition will prove 'even when you've lost a leg or lost an arm, or whatever the illness may be, that you can achieve pretty much anything if you put your mind to it'.

'The cause is for one cause and one cause only and that is to raise awareness for all the wounded, sick and injured whether it's in military life or whether it's in civilian life,' the prince said.

Harry, who will take time
off from his job as an Apache helicopter pilot in the Army Air Corps to
compete, will be part of a five-strong team of Britons racing against 
rivals from the U.S. and the Commonwealth to the southern-most point on 
the globe.

The marathon effort will see them travel a distance of 208
miles in temperatures of up to -50C, all while hauling custom built 
arctic sledges, weighing in excess of 11 stone.

Harry took to the stage and was presented with the expedition flag.

He said how much the men and women he will be walking with had done just to get here.

The money raised will go towards helping wounded service personnel.

He added: 'This trip is another way of reminding everybody that as Afghanistan draws down and these guys aren't in the news anymore so than they already are, it's a reminder to everybody that support must continue.'

As part of his expedition training, Prince Harry, an Army pilot who has served in Afghanistan, spent a night in a sub-zero Army test facility in September.

He and four team-mates, who all lost limbs in Afghanistan, were subjected to ambient temperatures down to -35C (-31F) and wind speeds of 45mph (72kph).

In the Antarctic, the team will face even lower temperatures of -45C (-49) and savage 50mph (80kph) winds.

They expect to trek for between nine and 12 miles a day (15 to 20km), dragging 11-stone (70kg) sledges, and are likely to encounter vast crevasses, moving ice-shelves, glaciers and snow storms.

Of the location, the prince said: 'Antarctica is the only place on earth that is still as it should be. May we never tame that, but I can assure you the boys and girls behind me will do their very best.'

The race begins on November 30 and competitors are expecting to reach the geographic South Pole by December 16.

Hopefully they'll all be home safely for Christmas which no doubt the new uncle hopes to celebrate with family
