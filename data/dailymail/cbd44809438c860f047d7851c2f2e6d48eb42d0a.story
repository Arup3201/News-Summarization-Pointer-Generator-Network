Tourism staff caused outrage on Facebook after they posted a censored picture of a kangaroo.

The image in which the animal's genitals were pixelated has attracted more than 1,500 comments since it was uploaded by Tourism Australia on Friday.

Many were furious that the photograph had been censored, despite the fact that it was apparently done as a light-hearted joke.

The censored image of Big Baz caused outrage on Facebook when it was posted by Tourism Australia

Tourism Australia posted the picture of Big Baz the kangaroo on its Facebook page, which shows him reclining on the grass at Featherdale Wildlife Park.

The caption read: 'Enjoying a lazy afternoon at Featherdale Wildlife Park *Censored for Facebook.'

However, many people did not see the funny side.

Natasha Duncan wrote: 'It's ridiculous that the reproductive organs of an animal are blurred out. How many sickos out there think this is sexual. Society sickens me.'

Wendy Jacobs wrote: 'Why are you censoring a kangaroo? omg, that's just crazy! I've got loads of pics of my dog on Facebook and none of them are censored.'

In three days the picture has been liked by more than 30,000 people and shared more than 5,000 times.

However, some were so incensed by the pixelated image that they stop 'liking' the page.

Martyn Hobbins wrote: 'How utterly pathetic. Censored for Facebook. You have just lost ALL my respect. I shall now remove the link to you, goodbye. Oh, and grow up.

'I was brought up in my teens in Australia. You do not represent the Australia I knew and loved.'

A Tourism Australia spokesperson told The Australian that the censoring was a joke.

They said: 'Anybody who's familiar with our Facebook page knows we like to have bit of fun with our posts and when Featherdale Wildlife Park sent us this cracker of a photo we just couldn't resist sharing it with our fans - in all of its magnificent glory. Or nearly all!'
