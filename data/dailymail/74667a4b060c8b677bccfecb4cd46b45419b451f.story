'Relax - here even the sharks are friendly.'

I am given this advice by my guide as, a few steps into the azure waters, I come face to fin with a shark. I can only watch in shock as a 5ft-long lemon shark glides within inches of my knees, before veering out to sea.

Welcome to Fernando de Noronha, a tiny island off Brazil so abundant in marine life that you can barely get into the water without standing on it.

A true slice of heaven: The Fernando de Noronha islands are Brazil at its most picturesque

Noronha is just one of the attractions in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco, a small region on the Atlantic coast in the north-east of the country. One of the first areas to be settled by the Portuguese in the 16th Century, the region is characterised by colonial buildings, multicultural cuisine and an ever-present carnival soundtrack.

I quickly discover Olinda, the elegant Unesco-listed colonial town set high on a hill, five miles up the coast from Recife, the state capital. Its 22 opulent churches and 11 chapels emerge from a verdant froth of palm and banana trees. I saunter up steep cobbled streets lined with pastel-painted art galleries and workshops, and spend the sultry evenings sipping drinks in arty bars lit by candles.

The road between Olinda and Recife is dotted with crumbling sugar mills.

The 16th Century sugar trade founded both cities, though by the end of the 17th Century Recife had become the biggest, most important city in South America. These days, information technology drives its economy - and its regeneration.

Over the past two years, hip bars, waterfront galleries and trendy restaurants have sprung up. With streets of gracious latte-tinted buildings set with Italianate columns and Moorish domes, the grand old Bank of London and Rua Bom Jesus with the oldest synagogue in the Americas, the place oozes history and charm.

But Pernambuco is prized by all Brazilians for one thing.

When I tell a Brazilian friend I'm going to Fernando de Noronha, she shrieks with excitement: 'You are not going to Brazil,' she trills. 'You are going to Heaven.'

Colourful chaos: Olinda, in Pernambuco, is listed as a Unesco World Heritage Site

Brazil has some heavenly beaches, many of them in and around Recife. I stayed in Recife's Boa Viagem district - three miles of pure gold sand so magnificent that the sight of it whisked the fuzz from my jet-lagged brain like a cerebral bikini wax.

Forty-five miles down the coast, past Porto de Galinhas, where tropical fish dip and dazzle in natural reef pools close to the palm-shaded shore, the powdery white beaches of Maracaipe are fringed by coconut plantations, and mangrove lagoons in which seahorses bob.

But even these, say the guide books, are eclipsed by the beaches of Noronha - which is incredible as this tiny island is only six miles long and two miles across.

Its pristine beaches and crystal-clear, marinerich waters are so popular that visitors to this Unesco-listed National Marine Park are limited to 500 a day (and they are charged an eco-tax).

After an hour's flight from Recife, I spend three days discovering Noronha's 17 beaches.

To the south, Lion Beach has the wow-factor. A huge fan of golden sand blasted by wind straight off the Atlantic, this is one of the most important turtle hatching sites in Brazil.

The Bay of Pigs in the north is even more magical: I sit on pillow-soft sand watching huge seabirds soar on the thermals, then plunge into the rolling surf.

A short clamber over volcanic rocks and I emerge into Sancho Bay. Framed by cliffs, the rockpool-dimpled beach is so impossibly pretty, overlooking waters so impossibly blue, it's hard to believe it is real. Even harder to believe is the view from the next headland, Mirante dos Golfinhos: multiple pods of spinner dolphins leap from the sea, light flashing from their slick bodies like disco balls.

But nothing comes close to wading into the calm waters of Southeast Bay, wearing flippers, snorkel and mask. And not just because I nearly tread on a shark. The shore quickly falls away, and within moments I am swimming over coral reef.

Friendly faces: Visitors are assured a warm welcome, whether it is during Olinda's famous spring Carnival (left), or from the lemon sharks Jennifer encountered in the warm waters around Fernando de Noronha (right)

The water in this part of the Atlantic is 78C, with visibility up to 165ft.

I have to force myself not to laugh with pleasure as, through a colourful curtain of tropical fish, I spot a huge octopus puffing along the ocean floor. Then a giant turtle appears just feet away.

Life's a beach on Fernando de Noronha. Thank heavens for that.
