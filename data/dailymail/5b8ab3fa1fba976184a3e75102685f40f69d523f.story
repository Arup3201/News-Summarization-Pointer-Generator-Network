Scotland was hit by a second bout of freak sandstorms today, causing an 
estimated £50,000 damage to crops.

Farmers in Elgin, Moray, had just 
spent a week clearing up after freak winds created 4ft high sand drifts on Tuesday when more gales swept in, whipping up further 
sandstorms and devastating crops.

 farmer Cameron MacIver said: 'There's parts around my farm where the only thing showing above the sand is the top bit of the fence.'

'The last bad case was when I was very young in the mid-70s and 
the mess it left was just incredible.'

Moray Council in eastern Scotland mobilised snowploughs to clear the roads, but today’s winds were threatening to undo much of the work.

Cameron MacIver explained: 'The effect has been felt far and wide again now. I'm hearing stories from all over the place that people are having exactly the same problems from Nairn to Buckie.'

Murray White, the National Farmers' Union branch secretary for Inverness, Nairn and Moray, said: 'It's going to take some farmers several days to clear the sand away.

'We might have lost 10 per cent of the harvest, and then again we might have lost 50 per cent. It's too early to say at the moment.

'The situation will only become apparent over the coming weeks when crops either grow or don't.'

Temperatures are expected to soar to a glorious 22C (71F), with southern areas enjoying one of the warmest days of the year so far.

If the mercury rises as high as predicted, it will be as hot as the city of Tangiers in Morocco – and warmer than California, where it is expected to reach just 19C (66f).

But the country will have a north-south split. While southerners enjoy relatively balmy conditions, those in northern England and Scotland will see temperatures dipping to zero at night.

And the chillier weather is expected to spread south by the weekend, bringing clouds and rain to most places. Forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘As we move into the middle of this week we could see one of the warmest days of the year so far, but only in a few places.

‘We will have a weather system that essentially cuts the UK in  half. Temperatures in the upper half – northern England and  Scotland – will be around 9-11C (48-52f), which isn’t too far off normal for the time of year.

‘But in the southern half of the UK we are likely to see fairly dry, fine weather, sunshine and temperatures that could reach 21C (70f).’

However, he warned the good weather 
would not last, adding: ‘By the time we get to Friday that band will 
have pushed its way to the south of the country. Most of the country can
 expect a cool and showery end to the week.

‘We can expect highs of 11C (52f), 
which is average for April. And on Saturday and Sunday we’ll have a band
 of rain from the north-west arriving in the south-east.'

The warmest day of the year so far was April 14, when 22C (72f) was recorded in Kent.

But these glimpses of good weather 
are little comfort to businesses struggling to deal with one of the 
coldest springs in decades.

In Lincolnshire, organisers of the 
Spalding Flower Parade are being forced to import hundreds of thousands 
of tulips from France because of a shortage of British blooms caused by 
cold weather.

Manager Kathleen Codd said there was ‘very little likelihood’ of getting enough homegrown flowers before the event on May 4.

Hayfever
 sufferers will feel the effects of the highest pollen levels for half a
 century, but the rest of us should enjoy a balmy few days - in which 
southern England will enjoy warmer weather than Hollywood (where it's 
currently around 19C) before it starts to feel unseasonably cold again.

Hay fever expert Professor Roy 
Kennedy said the cold March and start to April means the period until 
June will see its highest pollen levels since 1962.

Peak pollen levels normally occur later in summer, but the bitter March delayed the start of 
the pollen season by a month, with tree pollen now soaring and the 
expected 'phenomenon of tree pollen colliding with grass pollen' from 
mid-May.

Meanwhile the extended wintry conditions mean that spring is blooming late, quite literally.

Last
 year Britain’s gardens, 
parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour, but this 
spring has yet to bloom after a bitter March followed hard on the heels 
of a cold winter.

With
 spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers 
such as tulips or bluebells, many will be wondering if Britain will ever
 burst into bloom.

But garden writer Nigel Colborn, a 
former Royal Horticultural Society vice-chairman, says that with the 
arrival of warmer weather, we are likely to have a much shorter but more
 intense spring awakening.

Forecasters
 are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal 
average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners.

Mr Colburn said: ‘Plants, particularly spring varieties, have a self-survival kit.

'They
 won’t grow until the temperature is above 4C (39F) degrees for a period
 of time. Once warm weather sticks around they’ll kick into rapid 
growth.

'Because of the bitterly cold March, we are running about a month late compared to a normal season: Instead of it being a drawn-out 
spring, we are going to have an explosion of colour, but over a shorter 
period.We will soon be treated to a fantastically colourful bounty.’

After a pleasant, sunny weekend for much
 of the country, the Met Office says temperatures will remain slightly 
warmer than the seasonal average this week – reaching 20C (68F) by 
Thursday in the south east.

But it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens. At the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly 6C (43F).

May is almost upon us, but there were
 still patches of frost in parts of the UK overnight between Saturday and Sunday, with a low of 
-2.7C in Charlwood, Surrey.

While there will be some sunny spells
 across the UK in the coming week, Britons are advised to keep their 
umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses.

Mr Lawrence described bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and showers to the UK.

'This week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable.

'We've got bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, although it won't be a wash out.'

'A fair bit of cloud' is also 
expected throughout the week, he said, with conditions likely to change 
from sunny to grey even 'within each day'.

'Temperatures in the south might 
manage 20C in the South East later in the week, perhaps by Thursday,' 
said the forecaster, who added that current temperatures were fairly 
typical for the time of year.

'So it will be warm at times in the south. Broadly speaking we've got a north-south split, with the north wetter and windier, but still with some sunshine. In the south it will be less wet and windy.'

While temperatures dropped to 2.7C in Surrey overnight, Lossiemouth in Scotland recorded a low of 7.6C, in a 'flip' of the typical pattern of warmer conditions in the south.
