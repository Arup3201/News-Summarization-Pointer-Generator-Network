Odin the walrus had a number of fishy treats in preparation for his dental check at his zoo in Germany, but he turned decidedly grumpy once the inspection began.

It was Odin's first experience of the inventory as he only arrived at Hagenbecks zoo in Hamburg last month from his home in Moscow.

Although he has settled in well, he was very unimpressed when a keeper prized open his mouth to check his teeth and tried to manoeuvre himself out of the way.

Open wide: After some difficulty, the keeper finally had a satisfactory look inside Odin's cavernous mouth

Not a fan of the dentist: Odin had his big jaws prized open to check the state of his pointy teeth

Odin eagerly chomped through his fishy starter, main course and dessert, reaching up to his full height to get every mouthful.

Tipping the scales at an estimated 3,700 lbs, it takes a lot of fish to please a walrus the size of Odin.

Enormous: It takes a lot of little fish to fill up Odin's sizeable stomach

Towering: Stretching right up for the prize, Odin extended himself up fully to get his reward

Settling in: Odin has only been at the zoo for a few months, but has adjusted well to his new home

To check Odin's teeth were healthy, his keeper had to get his mouth wide open which took quite some tussle.Â 

Odin's mood soon soured when the fish stopped coming and the dental check-up was all he had to look forward to.

One last fish: Odin is always happy to have fish for starter, main course and dessert

Tempting treat: Odin gobbled up his fishy lunch while the zoo keeper checked him over

Tusks on a walrus like Odin can grow up to 1m in 
length, and males tend to have larger tusks than females.

The tusks are 
used for keeping breathing holes in the ice open, for fighting and for 
helping the walruses haul themselves out of the water on to an ice floe.

In the wild, walruses live mostly in 
shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant 
amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for 
molluscs to eat.

Grumpy: Odin went on the defensive as the keeper tried to inspect his mouth

Still not full: Odin playfully tilted his head in the hope of getting another fish from his zoo keeper
