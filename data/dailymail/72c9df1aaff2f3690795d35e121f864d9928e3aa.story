A pub-goer broke his leg as he 'tried to recreate a scene from Dirty Dancing' during a night out.

Gary Mackay was drinking in a pub when a female friend jumped up and tried to wrap her legs around him like the dance move in the 1987 film.

But he was left needing two bolts and a metal rod in his leg after snapping a bone while attempting the lift.

Gary Mackay was left in agony after breaking his leg when a woman tried to wrap her legs around him doing a dance move in a pub in Inverness

Witnesses said the woman involved was trying to react a move from hit 1980s film Dirty Dancing

Mr Mackay, 28, was in Johnny Foxes bar in Inverness, Scotland listening to a local covers band when the accident happened.

He said: 'It came out of nowhere. We were just talking about leaving - I wasn't even dancing with her. She just jumped up at me and wrapped her legs around me.

'I wasn't expecting it and I heard my leg snap. When I wasn't getting up I think the band realised and they stopped.

'I knew it was broken straight away - my foot just flopped to the side.'

After he was taken  to hospital by ambulance, doctors confirmed he had broken his leg in two places at the ankle and knee and he was not released for several days.

The barber needed a three-hour operation to insert two bolts and a metal rod in his leg and he now faces being off work for three months.

Bar owner Don Lawson said: 'There was a mix of horseplay and alcohol which didn't end well. A man and his friend were recreating a scene from Dirty Dancing.

'He fell funny which resulted in him breaking his leg. Our primary concern is for the chap who broke his leg. We hope he makes a speedy recovery.'

Mr Mackay said he had not heard from his impromptu dance partner since the accident.

He said: 'The worst thing is she's tiny - it's just the way she caught me. She's about five foot four and she's skinny. She's not been in touch but she's told my workmate she's mortified and sorry.'

Mr Mackay claims he was lifted up by bouncers, taken out through the fire escape and left on a bench.

'I was screaming, I was asking for someone to get me some help. I didn't want to get up. I wanted a paramedic to come and help me.

'I remember her still standing there when I was shouting. I did hear her saying 'I heard it snap'. That's the last I remember - I was just in so much pain.

'Eventually the bouncers put their arms around me and lifted me up. They just put me on a bench outside the fire exit and left me there.'

Bar owner Mr Lawson added: 'We lifted him to a safer part but he declined when we asked him if he wanted us to call an ambulance. His friends just took him.

Mr Mackay says the injury was made worse when he was picked up rather than being left for an ambulance

Dirty Dancing, which starred Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, became a huge hit after its release in 1987
