This spectacular photo captured from the International Space Station shows the full extent of the size of Hurricane Marie as it bears down on the West Coast, causing dangerous swells near the beaches of Southern California. 

While the hurricane was weakening over colder water today, with its sustained winds decreasing compared to Sunday, a low-lying street in Seal Beach was still inundated by a surge of rising seawater.

Police Sgt. John Scott says several homes and garages were flooded early Wednesday. Flooding is also reported to the north in Long Beach.

The image, which has been released by NASA, shows the hurricane as it spun off the Pacific coast of Mexico yesterday.

The National Weather Service has said beaches stretching 100 miles up the Southern California coast would see large waves.

The hurricane's winds however had decreased to near 85mph early today from a peak of 160mph on Sunday.

Marie, centred about 810 miles west of the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula and moving west-northwest near 13 mph, was expected to slump to tropical storm force later today.

Seal Beach resident Blanca Dubonbrown told City News Service how she woke up late yesterday to find her bedroom under three inches of water. 

Several of her neighbors in ground floor apartments also experienced flooding.

Marine Safety Chief Joe Bailey says crews are trying to dig a channel to allow water that had breached a beach wall to drain back into the ocean.

Coastal areas in Southern California were yesterday filling sandbags and building sand berms to ward against possible flooding from the potentially damaging surf spawned by Marie.

A large southerly swell was expected to produce large waves, rip currents and strong longshore currents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.

'These areas will potentially see the largest surf seen in recent years, with breakers of 10 to 15 feet possible,' a Weather Service advisory had said.

Swimmers and surfers were urged to be aware of dangerous conditions, and minor coastal flooding and beach erosion is possible, forecasters said.

In the city of Long Beach's Peninsula neighborhood, residents watched as bulldozers built huge sand berms between the ocean and their homes. Several took the warning to heart and shovelled sand into bags to place around their garage doors and entryways.
