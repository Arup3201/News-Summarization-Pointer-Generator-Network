The man accused of killing four people in a supermarket siege outside Paris last week had been on a US terror watch list, it has been reported.

Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four Jewish shoppers at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket to the east of the city, had been on a US terror database 'for a while,' a law enforcement official has revealed.

Coulibaly was on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), the government's central database that includes about one million names, CNN reported.

He is likely to have received help from others, including the two brothers suspected of shooting dead 12 people at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo last week.

US officials said after the attack that the brothers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, had been on a US terror watchlist 'for years.' 

French police say Coulibaly gunned down a policewoman in the suburb of Montrouge and may have shot a jogger on the outskirts of Paris before the bloody supermarket siege. 

In a video posted online on Sunday, a man identifying himself as Coulibaly claims responsibility for the Montrouge attack in the name of the Islamic State group, and says he 'co-ordinated' his actions with the Kouachi brothers.

Coulibaly and the brothers who carried out the Charlie Hebdo massacre were killed on Friday by police in a dramatic climax to two hostage dramas that played out during three days of terror in France.

Coulibaly was a repeat criminal offender who had been convicted for extremist activity.

The latest revelation that he was on a US watchlist is likely to pile more pressure on French security forces which have already been told to explain how the Kouachi brothers were allowed to drop off their radar - despite their activities having been monitored in the past. 

The hunt continues for Coulibaly's partner Hayat Boumeddiene. Intelligence sources in France believe she could have helped plan the attacks, possibly by supplying weapons.

She was initially thought to have been involved in the siege at the kosher store last Friday but it has since emerged she had in fact fled Paris a week earlier, arriving in Turkey on January 2.

She is now thought to be in Syria with Islamic State fighters.
