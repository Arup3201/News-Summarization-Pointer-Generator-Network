It appears Liverpool forward Fabio Borini ran his fiancée Erin O’Neill close in the skimpiest swimwear stakes on their latest holiday in the Bahamas, after the model posted a series of revealing snaps on her Instagram account.

Days after asking O’Neill to marry him in Times Square, Borini whisked her off to the Turks and Caicos Islands for a dream holiday.

And with the sun shining on the happy pair, Borini posed for pictures with O’Neill wearing nothing more than a tiny pair of Speedos.

Up for the fight: After returning to Liverpool with a goal against Shamrock Rovers, Borini wants to earn a way back into Brendan Rodgers' plans for next season at Anfield

O’Neill posted a number of pictures from their holiday on her Instagram, one of which included the hashtag ‘#italianmenloveaspeedo’.

Borini is preparing to return to Anfield for next season after a successful year on loan at the Stadium of Light with Sunderland.

There, the forward gave a compelling account of himself, scoring 10 goals in 40 appearances throughout the season.

In doing so, the 23-year-old was instrumental in Sunderland surviving relegation to the Championship.
