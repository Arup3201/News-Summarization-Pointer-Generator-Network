A restaurant featured in a BBC documentary claims it threw away £4,000 of Michelin-star quality food because homeless charities refused to accept it.

Aiden Byrne says he was forced to bin £70 Cumbrian veal cutlets, £50 steaks and £29 turbot fillets in Restaurant Wars; The Battle for Manchester because homeless groups turned the meals down on health and safety grounds.

The show followed chefs Simon Rogan and Mr Byrne as they opened competing venues The French and Manchester House in Manchester, both with ambitions to win a Michelin Star.

Controversy: Chef Aiden Byrne says he was forced to dump £4,000 of food during a BBC documentary on health and safety grounds

Controversial: Manchester House cooked the extravagant meals and served them to empty tables before they were dumped in the bin

Row: The food was binned after the 'stress test' on the day before the restaurant opened, which was widely criticised

Manchester House decided to test its full menu on the day before it opened, which led to 70 meals being cooked and not eaten.

Critics: Celebrity chef James Martin said he was 'horrified' by the waste during Restaurant Wars

Waiting staff served them to empty tables before management tasted some of them before scraping the rest into the bin.

The decision has been widely criticised, including by celebrity chef James Martin who said today he was 'horrified'.

But Mr Byrne says that charities were offered the food but refused because his kitchen had not been vetted.

He tweeted: 'For the record Manchester House offered food to homeless 
organisations and it was declined because it wasn’t registered.'

A colleague told The Times: 'Aiden did approach several charities, but was turned down because it was a spontaneous donation'.

But despite the explanation James Martin said he had never seen anything like it.

He said: 'When you’re making a programme like Restaurant Wars I know that 
things are edited a certain way, but I didn’t like it, I didn’t like 
what it represented and I didn’t enjoy it.

'When you have a scene
 where you serve food for a restaurant full, but then chuck it all away,
 I don’t like that at all, I was horrified to watch it.

'I’ve worked in a lot of restaurants in my time but that’s the first time I’ve ever seen that.'

Fairshare, a charity that helps distribute food across Britain, says that millions of plates of food could be being wasted in this way.

A spokesman said: 'We just can't work with restaurants at the moment because it is too hard to regulate pre-cooked food, which is a shame as millions of plates worth of amazing food are being thrown away each year'.

In contrast Jennifer Davies tweeted: 'I think that’s 
doubtful. I’ve given conference food to homeless orgs in the past and 
there wasn’t an issue.'

Panned: Viewers took to Twitter after becoming angry about the decision to throw away all the food

Response: Aiden Byrne responded to say that they had tried to give away the food but struggled because of red tape

Tim Bacon, CEO and Co-Founder of Living Ventures who are the owners 
of Manchester House in partnership with Aiden Byrne said: 'The £4000 
food wastage figure mentioned was at sales price including 
VAT and equates to .£1000 in real cost. Still a completely 
unsatisfactory situation and is something we do very rarely. 
Unfortunately we needed to stress test the kitchen and look at the 
affect on food quality'.

The BBC said it would not comment because it was an issue for the restaurant involved.
