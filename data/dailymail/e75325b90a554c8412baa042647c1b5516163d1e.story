The daughter of Uzbekistan's president is allegedly being kept under house arrest by her father who 'sent men to beat her up'. 

Gulnara Karimova, 41, is said to be being held by security forces from her father's dictatorial regime on allegations of corruption.

According to the BBC she managed to smuggle a letter out to inform people of her arrest.

In it she wrote: 'How naive was I to think that the rule of law exists in the country?

'The reason for the Pinochet-style persecution is that I dared to speak up about things that millions are quiet about.'

According to sources, Ms Karimova, who is a pop star in Uzbekistan, was put under house arrest with her 15-year-old daughter on February 17. 

Her father, Islam Karimov is believed to have ordered 20 to 30 men to raid her apartment after she suggested travelling to Israel for medical treatment because she feared doctors may try and kill her in Uzbekistan.

According to uznews.net Ms Karimova's partner was arrested and beaten up. Ms Karimova tried to escape but was dragged back to the flat where she was beaten, it is alleged. 

It also emerged last week that Swedish prosecutors are investigating Ms Karimova on suspicion of taking bribes to let Nordic telecoms company TeliaSonera enter the country's market

Ms Karimova had already been named by the Swiss public prosecutor as a suspect in the case which is also being investigated by Dutch and U.S. authorities.

Prosecutors are looking into allegations that when TeliaSonera paid 2.3 billion Swedish crowns (Â£216million) for a 3G licence in Uzbekistan in 2007 to Gibraltar-registered firm Takilant, it knew the company was a front for Ms Karimova.

The allegations, first made in a Swedish television programme in 2012, have already forced most of the TeliaSonera board, its chief executive and several senior employees from their jobs.

In a request to a Stockholm court asking for more time to bring charges, Swedish prosecutors said they suspected that representatives for TeliaSonera had bribed members of Uzbekistan's 'political elite'.

'In the investigation there is now a concrete basis, including information on control over assets, which gives reason to suspect that Gulnara Karimova, who also served as a public official during the time period relevant for the case, was the one who orchestrated, controlled, and also was the one who primarily benefited from the procedure,' the prosecutors said.

She has in the past denied allegations of business impropriety.

TeliaSonera, which has appointed its own lawyers to investigate its past business deals in Uzbekistan and other countries in the region, said it was collaborating with the prosecutors.

Uzbekistan's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva from December 2008 until last year, Ms Karimova is also a jewellery designer and pop singer whose stage name is Googoosha.

Uzbekistan has one of the world's worst human rights records. In 2002 two prisoners were boiled alive.
