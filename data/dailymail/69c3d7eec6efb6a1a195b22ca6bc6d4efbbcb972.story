A Texas man fatally shot his ex-girlfriend Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide just hours after the woman went to the police seeking protection, police say.

Heather Coglaiti, 33, reported her ex-boyfriend, 46-year-old Jose Calderon, to the Corpus Christi Police Department Monday seeking protection after he allegedly slashed her tires and sent her threatening text messages.

Calderon spoke with police in a 37-minute interview and was released without being charged, according to BuzzFeed.

Approximately 16 hours later, Coglaiti and Calderon were found dead in a Corpus Christi apartment.

Police say Calderon forced his way inside the mother-of-three's apartment in Flour Bluff, shot her brother, shot her, then shot himself, KRIS-TV reports. 

Someone called the police around 5am Tuesday morning after hearing gun shots, and police arrived to the gruesome scene. Coglaiti's brother suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to a hospital where he was listed in stable condition, KZTV reports.  

Coglaiti's two young daughters were in another room when the shots rang out, they were not injured.

The tragedy was the culmination of a series of incidents of domestic abuse between the two. 

The couple had broken up earlier this year after being in an on-again-off-again relationship for two years, according to KRIS-TV.

Coglaiti's friends and family told KRIS that the after the two broke up in January, Calderon began harassing Coglaiti and she feared for her safety.

In the last month, Coglaiti reportedly filed seven reports with the police against Calderon including receiving death threats, Calderon smashing her windows, and recently slashing her tires.

Police say that once Calderon even poured a bottle of liquor on Coglaiti's head and threatened to set her on fire. Coglaiti's friends said she was afraid Calderon would go through with his threats.

A friend of Coglaiti's told KIII-TV, that the woman lived in constant fear of Calderon and the victim's younger brother was staying with her and her three children in the apartment to protect them.

'There was a couple of times when police were called,' the friend said, 'but it was pretty much one of those things where she tried to handle it herself and they'd argue and he'd leave and she'd let him back in.'

When Coglaiti reported Calderon to police Monday, Calderon agreed to give his side of the story.

In the 37-minute interview, Calderon admitted breaking her car windows but denied threatening her and slashing her tires, KRIS reports.

'We've done this a lot through the whole two years, Calderon said. 'We go back and forth, we'll fight like this and she knows I won't punch her but she punches the hell out of me in the face and she'll bite, do whatever.

'She said, 'I'm so scared you're gonna kill me,' I've never said that out of my mouth...she's not quite as innocent as she makes it out to be.'

There was not enough evidence to arrest Calderon after the interview, NBC reports, and he was released. 

Officials say this is the fourth homicide of the year and the third related to domestic violence.  

Police Chief Floyd told reporters Wednesday that the department had done all it could to help Coglaiti.
