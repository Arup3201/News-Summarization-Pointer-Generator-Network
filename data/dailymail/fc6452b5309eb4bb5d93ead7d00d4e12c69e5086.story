A mother has shown incredible forgiveness after asking police not to press charges against a 15-year-old boy who allegedly killed her son while joyriding.

Mason Merrill, 22, died when a pickup truck reportedly being driven by the teenager smashed into his scooter in Mesa, Arizona.

He was given CPR by a police officer and taken to hospital, but later succumbed to his injuries.

Forgiving: Carrie Merrill has asked police not to charge a 15 year old boy who allegedly killed her son

Now, his mother, Carrie Merrill, has said she has forgiven the boy who allegedly killed him - adding that her Mormon son had 'lived more life than most people do in a lifetime'.

'You know, life is dangerous and I am not angry at this boy,' she told CBS Atlanta.

'I would hate
 to be in his shoes and I feel so much for his family. This tragedy has 
really taken more than one life.'

Victim: Mason Merrill, 22, was driving a scooter when a pickup truck reportedly being driven by the teenager smashed into him in Mesa, Arizona

The mother of six added that she had asked police not to pursue charges against the underage driver, who is believed to have been accompanied by three other teenagers in the truck, including his 14-year-old sister.

'He has got his whole life ahead of him. Why do I want to take that away from him? I don't want to,' she said.

Mr Merrill, a talented musician who recently served on a mission trip to Mexico for his church, was knocked off his scooter when the blue 'lifted' truck turned in front of him on University Drive, near Alma School Road, according to witnesses.

The teenage driver, who only had a learner's driving permit, is believed to have climbed out of the vehicle and run over to the victim, before driving away.

A nearby Mesa police officer arrived at the scene at 2.25pm and alerted the emergency services, before performing CPR on Mr Merrill in a bid to keep him alive, according to a police spokesman.

Mrs Merrill, who first heard of the incident on television but did not think it would involve one of her children, said she had driven to the crash site following inquiries from family and friends.

She said she 'knew' the victim was her son as she spotted his scooter lying in the road.

Following the incident on Wednesday, police used witness descriptions to track down the truck to a house in the area of Alma School and Broadway.

The teenage driver and his sister were arrested and taken into custody, before later beingÂ released to their parents.

Amazingly, Mr Merrill's sister, Carlie, has also said she is not angry with the driver - saying: 'There was no malice in it, it was just a kid. It was 
reckless, but are you supposed to condemn him for life for something he 
will regret for the rest of his life?'

The unnamed driver is facing a potential failure-to-yield charge, while charges of leaving the scene of a fatality and other traffic violations are being submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for consideration.

Mrs Merrill is collecting donations towards her son's funeral expenses via an online fund.
