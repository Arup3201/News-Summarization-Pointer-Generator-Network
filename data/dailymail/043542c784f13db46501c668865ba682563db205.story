This is the grinning face of a sex attacker who terrorised women for more than twenty years.

John Williams, 47, was responsible for a spate of at least 14 assaults dating back to 1991 on victims aged from 16 to 50.

He has now been given a potentially lifelong sentence by a judge who told him he may never be considered safe enough to be release.

Williams, a former concrete mixer, targeted women around Ashford in Kent where he lived with his wife and family.

Grinning: John Williams has been given a potentially lifelong sentence for a spate of sex attacks on women and girls in Ashford, Kent over 20 years

Prosecutor Peter Forbes said: 'This was a campaign of sexual assaults against a number of girls and women ranging from 16 to 50 years old.

'Predominantly his victims were walking alone on footpaths in parks or wooded areas when they were attacked from behind and taken to the ground.'

Williams admitted 13 sex assaults dating from 1991 to August 2013 and asked for a further 16 offences, including another sexual assault, to be taken into consideration.

Canterbury Crown Court heard how he told one 18 year-old victim: 'If you scream, I'll rape you.'

Another said the attack changed her from a person 'who would walk without fear, to a prisoner in her own home'.

When Williams approached one woman in 1994 he told her he had been offending for months.The prosecutor said the attacks originally related to the theft or attempted thefts of handbags.

Mr Forbes said: 'Usually they were done on a lone woman walking in wooded areas during the hours of darkness - and some of the incidents were also sexual.'

Some of his victims wept in the public gallery as Judge Adele Williams sent him to jail.

He must serve at least seven years behind bars and will only be released if he can convince a parole board is no longer dangerous.

The judge said: 'You have carried out a terrifying campaign of sexual attacks. You are a sexual predator and a danger to women. You caused terror in all your victims.'

She added: 'I have no doubt your victims felt terror and have been deeply traumatised.

'Such was the public horror and revulsion of your offences, this calls for a denunciatory sentence. The effect of my sentence is you may never be released.'

The court heard that police bungled the hunt for Williams when he was identified as a suspect by one victim - but they failed to take a DNA sample from him in 2012.

It was not until a year later that he was caught after he was able to carry out two more attacks on young women.

A detective chief inspector and a detective constable were served with gross misconduct notices for the shocking blunder.

The court heard that Williams told a psychiatrist he was glad he had been caught and was 'disgusted' with himself.
