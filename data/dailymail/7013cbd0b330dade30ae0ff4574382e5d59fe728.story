A grown man who has spent thousands feeding his My Little Pony obsession loves dressing up as the make-believe horses.

Rob Harrison, 34, from Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, is part of a legion of male fans who openly adore the cartoon - a group so large they even have their own nickname 'bronies', from 'bro' and 'pony'.

He loves watching characters such as Twilight Sparkle, Fluttershy and Applejack cantering across his screen every week.

Rob first became a fan of the show in 2013 after being asked to help at BronyCAN

The IT consultant has filled his home with memorabilia from plush toys to full body costumes he and his fellow bronies wear to conventions.

Rob, who is currently single, admits he knows people will laugh at his obsession but insists it doesn't bother him.

He said: 'I always knew people were interested in the show - I was kind of ignoring it because thought it was a show for girls.

'But I was ignorant. It wasn't until after I watched it I realised they were going for more general focus.

'I've been into cartoons for as long as I can remember. I have so much in my apartment my friends and family aren't surprised any more.

'I just roll with it. If people try to make me look bad and get a laugh then I gave them a laugh they didn't have. I'll laugh with them.

After the encounter with an army of bronies at BronyCan he immediately took to the camaraderie

'It's just an interest like any other hobby - we are just a group of guys getting together sharing a common interest.'

Rob first became a fan of the show in 2013 after being asked to help at BronyCAN - the biggest male My Little Pony convention in Canada.

And after the encounter with an army of kindred spirits he immediately felt at home with the camaraderie and common interest of the group.

He added: 'I met a bunch of people in the community and realised they were a lot of fun to be around.

'Plus it turned out I liked the material more than I thought I would. The show was fun but the whole package is what sealed the deal.

'A lot of meet-ups are drinking parties - people don't realise as this is an internet community.

'But we all found this weird thing online so why not get together and have fun.

'I do travel for it. Seattle, USA, is the furthest I've been but there is one in the UK and Germany too for example.

'It seems like there are more and more brony conventions popping up every single month.'

Ironically, Rob says even though an ex-girlfriend attempted to convert him he never liked My Little Pony.

He says if he met a girl and she wanted him to give it up - then he could

But now he has taken to the show he insists it doesn't stop him meeting other women.

He said: 'I used to make fun of my ex for it - but she must have shown me a few episodes I didn't like.

'It was a surprise I ended up getting into it. If I met another girl and she wanted me to give it up then I could as it's an interest not a lifestyle.

'However if someone were to ask me to give up a piece of myself I wouldn't want to be with them anyway.'

My Little Pony was a hugely popular children's franchise in the Eighties and Nineties but its fandom became elevated to a new level when a new cartoon reboot premiered in 2010.

The animation's sub-title is 'Friendship is magic' and follows a studious unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia teaches her about friendship in the town of Ponyville.

Female fans of the series are sometimes called Pegasisters. 

Rob - whose other interests include costume performance, cars and photography - reckons being a brony is an inexpensive hobby that anyone can get into.

He added: 'I've spent a few thousand on my collection. I don't go for the super rare, expensive stuff; more the vinyl collectables, card games and a few plush characters.

'I have a pretty substantial collection from the trading card game which I have almost every card and am known for.

'My front room is full of My Little Pony figures but they look good so I'm going to keep them there.'
