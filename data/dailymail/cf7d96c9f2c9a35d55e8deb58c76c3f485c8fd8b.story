We’ve cleaned up free kicks with the magic spray, there seems to be less diving, but football has a new evil – wrestling in the penalty area.

Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul their opponents and too often referees are allowing it to take place.

When the talented young referee Michael Oliver pulled up serial offender Ryan Shawcross two weeks ago, all hell seemed to break loose. His fellow officials should have supported him by following up the bold decision, but instead we had Phil Dowd allowing double headlocks at Old Trafford.

Ryan Shawcross of Stoke was rightly penalised for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground during last weekend's match at the Britannia Stadium

Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation in pointing to the penalty spot after Shawcross fouled Bony

But when Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic (left) and John Terry were held in headlocks by Manchester United defenders Chris Smalling (left) and Marcos Rojo in Sunday's match, referee Phil Dowd failed to act

Ivanovic appeals for a penalty as he lies on the ground with Smalling on top of him

Referee Phil Dowd, who later sent Ivanovic off, ignored Chelsea's appeal for a penalty

HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

I have no sympathy for a defender who concedes a penalty for wrestling or throwing his opponent. 

The headlocks against John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were remarkable and should have resulted in a penalty. Mistakes from Dowd saved Manchester United.

Of course, it isn’t easy for a referee when there are five or six match-ups for every corner, so they need to be educated, too. Defenders know a referee cannot see what every camera can and so he will take a risk in the hope of gaining an advantage.

Some are more obvious to spot than others – and headlocks are a bit of a clue! I played once against Alessandro Nesta in the Champions League.

I had been watching the Italian defender and the way he would face a player – and not the ball. He would then wrestle his opponent in much the same way as we are seeing in the Premier League today. I worked out a way to combat this.

I gave myself five yards and ran at him aggressively before the corner came in. He was startled, the referee came over and said: ‘What is going on?’

I explained he needed to watch Nesta, we both got a warning and when the corner came in, all eyes were on us and Nesta couldn’t apply his blocking tactic. It was a small victory.

Defenders who do not attack the ball, but face their opponents and focus on stopping… that’s not football. It’s blatant fouling and deserves punishment. If you are obsessed more with stopping your opponent than winning the ball, that cannot be right.

Shawcross is a regular offender. I’m convinced Tony Pulis must have shown him how to do it, when he was manager of Stoke. Liverpool’s Martin Skrtel too. Chelsea’s powerhouse Ivanovic is a contact player, using his huge strength and physicality to draw fouls or to invite a reaction.

There are different degrees of contact in the box. As a defender, you might feel you want to act as a barrier.

Alessandro Nesta (right), seen here with Emmanuel Adebayor in a match against Arsenal, would frequently try and wrestle opponents to the ground

Martin Keown developed a strategy for dealing with players like Nesta when he encountered them with Arsenal

Blocking is part of the game. Basketball is a non-contact sport, but there is an art to blocking and stopping your opponent from getting where he wants to go. It’s the same with football.

The odd tug of a shirt was in my make-up, but only when an opponent was close. If he was too far away, it became too obvious to the referee and you risked giving away a penalty. There is no defender in the world who hasn’t tugged a shirt to impact on the balance of his opponent.

I would use whatever it took and take more risks further up the pitch, but I didn’t like to concede an advantage to the striker and by fouling in the penalty area, you are at high risk to concede a spot kick. 

My attitude was ‘I’m here to stop you, but I don’t want to give you anything’. A defender has to stay calm and focused in that moment.

That’s where zonal marking and concentrating on your space works better than going man-to-man in the area. Zonal allows you to concentrate on winning the ball in your zone, whereas man marking can invite the temptation to foul.

Martin Skrtel of Liverpool has also been guilty of wrestling opponents in the box

I was into judo as a kid and never lost a bout, but I never used a judo throw in a game. Watching some of the recent incidents, such a skill might come in handy!

I was never taught to foul. You learn what you need to do. George Graham, at Arsenal, worked on a lot of repetitive defensive work. The back four would work together and he would overload on strikers, coming at your from all angles. It was like being in the land of the giants.

We were hard to play against, we defended for our lives and we were aggressive and strong. But we didn’t resort to wrestling and it shouldn’t be allowed now.

Referees must clamp down, but strikers will need to be fair, too. If they are diving, trying to con the referee into believing they have been wrestled, then that should result in serious punishment.

There will be some strikers who will see this campaign and think ‘happy days, I’ll fall over, win a cheap penalty.’ There needs to be more honesty from them, too.

Players are getting away with blocking, holding and grappling too often

The latest example came at Old Trafford on Sunday

Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry were put in headlocks by Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo but referee Phil Dowd did nothing

It is just the latest incident of late as defenders push their luck

Referees need to clamp down on these incidents immediately
