British companies sold chemicals used to make lethal nerve agent sarin to Syria in the 1980s, ministers will admit today.

In the week that the US has started the process of destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons, it has emerged that the UK supplied the country with key elements for making them. 

It is a major embarrassment for the British government, after condemning the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime during the bloody three-year civil war.

British firms were the sole suppliers of three chemicals that Syria used in the production of sarin. A member of UN investigation team is pictured in Damascus last year taking samples of sands after reports of a chemcial weapons attack

Ministers will today rush out a statement to the Commons on historical exports to Syria.

According to BBC'S Newsnight, a leaked Foreign Office document said the phosphate chemicals used to manufacture sarin were supplied in the mid 1980s.

A Government spokesman said controls have been tightened since the chemicals were sold. 

A report by the UN last year found that in one particular incident in Damascus 'chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale, resulting in numerous casualties, particularly among civilians and including many children'.

While President Bashar al-Assad's government was accused of being behind chemical attacks during recent years of fighting, he has always denied this, blaming opposition forces.

David Cameron was defeated in a Commons vote last year on ordering British military intervention in Syria.

He argued that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime crossed a 'red line' and the rest of the world could not stand by.

In what was thought to be an unprecedented parliamentary reverse over British military action, Tory rebels joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister. 

However, after the US threatened missile strikes in retaliation for a chemical attack on a rebel-held suburb of Damascus, Syria agreed to surrender its arsenal. 

The material handed over by Syria included mustard gas and precursors to the nerve gas sarin. 

On Monday the Pentagon said the destruction of the chemical weapons on board the US cargo vessel MV Cape Ray had begun. 

It is expected to take about 60 days to destroy the approximately 600 metric tons of material loaded onto the ship.

Last month Syria handed over to Western powers the 1,300 tons of chemical weapons it acknowledged possessing. 

Prime Minister David Cameron suffered a humiliating defeat in the Commons last August, when MPs refused to back British military action in response to Syria's use of chemical weapons

Documents handed passed by Syria to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reveal details of how chemicals used to produce sarin came from the UK.

British firms were the the sole supplier of dimethyl phosphate (DMP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and hexamine - three chemicals that Syria used in the production of sarin, the BBC said.

In addition to hundreds of metric tonnes of the chemicals, in 2003 Britain sold electrical fans to Damascus which were used in the manufacture of sarin.

A Government spokesman said: 'We do not comment on what are alleged leaked documents.

'Officials have been reviewing historical Government records on exports to Syria including from the 1980s, when we know Syria was building its chemical weapons programme and importing goods from a range of countries, with a view to an announcement in Parliament .

'Export controls have been tightened very significantly since the 1980s.'
