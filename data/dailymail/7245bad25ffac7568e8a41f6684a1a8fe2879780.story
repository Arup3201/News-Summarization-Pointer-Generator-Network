An Arizona high school student has been suspended after driving to school with the Confederate flag flying from his truck.

Jacob Green, 17, insists he is not a racist person and that flying the flag wasn’t a problem until a few weeks ago when another boy got into a fight with him.

The Confederate flag has remained a controversial symbol since the Civil War and to this day still incites a lot of emotion.

Some call it a symbol of hate from an era that preached segregation among Americans.

After the fight, both boys at the school in Goodyear were suspended.

Jacob has been banned from displaying the flag on campus but he has argued that the school has violated his first amendment rights to freedom of speech.

The school district says it can limit students' rights while they're here on campus, especially when it comes to safety.

The 13 stars of the Confederate flag represent the southern states who attempted secession from the United States during the Civil War, and where slavery was legal.

The Confederate States set up a government from 1861 to 1865, but were eventually defeated by northern states in the U.S. Civil War.

The 13 stars on the Confederates Flag represent the states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri.

In an email to parents following the incident, school officials explained that both students were suspended for five days and that Jason was prohibited from bringing the flag on campus. 

‘Open display.. bringing it in.. it has 
been proven to be patently offensive to certain groups and the courts 
recognize that,’ said Agua Fria Unified School District Superintendent 
Dennis Runyan.

Historically, the flag has been known to symbolize a time of oppression and racism, but the 11th grader at Millennium High School says he has a different view of the flag.

‘I'm not a racist person,’ said Jacob Green to Fox News ‘I've done nothing wrong. I've flown a flag on my truck. Somebody fought me because of it.  I didn't fight him.  I was walking around like a normal person.  He confronted me, he hit me first.. I was defending myself,’ he explained.

Jacob claims that the flag wasn't a problem until a couple of weeks ago when he and another boy got into a fight at school.

Jacob says he researched the history of the Confederate flag and didn't find it offensive.

‘The flag means basically more independence, less government.  It didn't mean racism, it didn't mean slavery, it didn't mean any of that. It basically meant what they were fighting for was their right to be independent and not have the government control them.’

Jacob has so far refused to remove the flag from his car.

His parents also back him saying that they believe their son should  have the right to fly the flag at school. They also believe the student who attacked their son committed a hate crime and are considering filing a police report

Either way, the school believes the flag to be a source of trouble and Jacob won’t be allowed to return to campus until he changes his mind.
