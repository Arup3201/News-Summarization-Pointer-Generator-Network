A five-year-old is thought to have become one of the world’s youngest Karate black belts - despite battling juvenile arthritis.

Jake Frood took up the martial art aged just three after watching the classic film, The Karate Kid.

The youngster, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, enrolled at the city’s National Martial Arts College and now hopes to become a fully trained instructor by his tenth birthday.

Jake Frood, five, has become one of the world's youngest Karate black belts despite having arthritis and an immune disorder. He suffers from stiffness in his limbs and falls ill frequently

He has achieved one of the sport’s top accolades despite suffering joint stiffness due to his condition.

His mother, Kerry Frood, 31, said: ‘He watched the Karate Kid and absolutely loved it and has just gone from strength to strength.

‘There is no-one else at his age that we can find who has been given a black belt.

‘It’s just unbelievable and without martial arts he wouldn’t be the person he is today.

‘People just can’t believe how young he is and he is so small for his age too.’

Jake, who is just 3ft tall, was recently awarded his black belt after completing a gruelling challenge which included a two-mile run and four-hour martial arts test.

Ms Frood, who works as a nurse, said: ‘When Jake was first diagnosed with arthritis at three years old his legs were so weak.

‘He tried physiotherapy, but found it far too difficult.

‘He had started martial arts by this point and, even though he was finding that hard too, the doctors told him to keep on with it as it would make his legs stronger.

‘So he kept up with it and has flourished as a true champion. His legs are much stronger now too.’

She added: ‘I don’t think there are many children his age that could do what Jake does. He might be small but he is hard as nails, I’m so proud of what he has achieved.’

Jake also suffers from an immune disorder, which doctors are currently trying to get to the bottom of.

His mother said: ‘Jake will always catch every single illness that is going round. His immune system is very, very weak.

‘But because of his love for martial arts he battles everything that comes his way.’

The youngster has had through several illnesses and operations and was even back training weeks after surgery on his hand.

Ms Frood said: ‘He was back on the mat at martial arts within weeks of his op as he didn’t want to fall behind.

Juvenile arthritis is that which occurs before a child turns 16.

It causes one or more of the joints to become swollen, painful and stiff.

Some children with arthritis also suffer eye and teeth problems as well as slow growth.

Treatment options include steroids, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medications.

‘Martial arts have definitely saved his life and made him a stronger person.

‘Without his love for it he wouldn’t have had the determination to get through his illnesses.

‘He’s now saying that he wants to open up his own martial arts school when he grows up and by the age of 10 he should be a qualified instructor.’

Jake, who has a nine-year-old brother called Junior, is now set to take his black belt into school to show off to his classmates.
