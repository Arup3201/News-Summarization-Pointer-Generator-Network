This is the dramatic moment a neighbour bravely chases off three armed burglars who were raiding a house on his street.

Armed with just a piece of wood, the man was seen on CCTV confronting the trio as they run at him with a knife and a hammer.

But when he refuses to back down, the burglars turn tail and flee into the distance.

Raid: Armed burglars - one in a hoodie, the other in a hi-vis jacket and balaclava - target a house in Oldham

Evidence: The incident was caught on cameras installed by the homeowners after a previous burglary

Heroic: A father-of-two confronts the burglars with a piece of wood after the alarm go off at the house

The father-of-two, who did not want to be
 named, leapt into action when he heard his neighbour's alarm go off in 
Failsworth, Oldham.

The 49-year-old said: 'I ran over and 
saw a guy in a hi-vis jacket. At first I thought it must have been my 
neighbour doing some work on his house.

'Then he turned round and looked at me and I saw he had a balaclava on. That’s when I knew.'

The neighbour dashed back home and told his daughter to call police while he grabbed a piece of wood from his garage and ran back.

He said: 'I banged on the door shouting "get out, you scumbag" and I tried to open the door but it was locked.

'So I ran round the side of the house and kicked the gate open and as I came round the corner I saw there was three of them.

'One of them had a big sharp kitchen knife and another ran at me with the hammer. I stood my ground and they shot off.'

Brave: The neighbour dashes round the side of the house to confront the burglars. It is thought the burglars were after the keys to the Audi TT parked outside

Sent packing: The burglars ran at the neighbour with a knife and hammer, but fled when he stood his ground

Fleeing into the distance: The couple whose home was burgled have hailed their neighbour a hero

He added: 'When you look back at the video it’s quite frightening.

'When they’ve got a knife and a hammer and it’s three against one you’ve got no chance, but you don’t think at the time.'

But he said he would '100 per cent' do it again.

He said: 'You can’t let them get away with it. It’s so wrong. You go to work to earn money so you can have nice things and they have no respect for people. They’ve got to be caught.'

The couple whose home was burgled - who also did not want to be named - have hailed their neighbour a hero.

Caught on camera: The footage, which has been seen by detectives, shows the gang getting out of a light-coloured BMW X5 before forcing their way in through the back door

The man said: 'He was great. I would have done the same for him.'

They suspect the burglars were after the keys for their Audi TT parked outside.

It was not taken but the thieves escaped with cash after prising open a safe with a crowbar.

The incident was caught on cameras installed by the homeowners after a previous burglary.
