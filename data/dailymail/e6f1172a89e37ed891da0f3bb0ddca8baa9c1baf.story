At first glance, it might look like just a
piece of leftover holiday loose change, but it is actually worth millions -
making it possibly the most valuable ounce of gold in the world.

The rare 1933 $20 Double Eagle is the most
expensive gold coin ever to be sold at auction and a legend among collectors.

Now, for the first time, a Double Eagle -
one of which sold for $7.6million (£4.8million) at Sotheby's in 2002 - will be exhibited in the
UK.

Nearly half a million of the gold coins were minted in the U.S. in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression but only 13
are known to exist today.

For the first time, a rare 1933 $20 Double Eagle will be exhibited in the UK

Nearly half a million of the gold coins were minted in the U.S. in 1933 in the midst of the Great Depression but only 13 are known to exist today

The rest of the coins, featuring an eagle
on one side and Liberty on the other, were melted down before they ever left
the United States Mint, sacrificed as part of a strategy to remove America from the gold standard and stabilise the American economy.

Only one coin is legally in private hands,
with all other 1933 Double Eagles remaining as property of the U.S. government,
and the U.S. secret service pursues any newly discovered coins.

The coin which will go on display in
London next month is one of two 1933 Double Eagles saved by the U.S. Mint and
given to the Smithsonian Institution in 1933 as a matter of record.

The
1933 'Double Eagle' was dreamed up by President Roosevelt’s distant 
cousin,Theodore, who had commissioned the sculptor Augustus 
Saint-Gaudens to re-design the $20 gold coin in the early 1900s.

Teddy Roosevelt wanted an American coin that matched the beauty of the ancient Greek ones.

The last run of nearly 500,000 coins were never released, and it was thought they were all melted down for scrap.

In industry speak, an 'eagle' is $10, hence the term 'double eagle' for the $20 1933 examples.

The exhibition is part of a European tour
arranged by the Samlerhuset Group, parent company of the London Mint Office,
with the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, based in Washington
DC.

It is the first time that the Smithsonian
has sent an object from its numismatic collection on tour in Europe.

Peter Swanston, chief executive of the
London Mint Office, said: 'This is an incredibly exciting event. As well as
being immensely valuable, the 1933 Double Eagle is a truly beautiful coin.

'We are thrilled to bring it to London and
I'm sure many people will want to come and see this icon of American history.'

Marc Pachter, interim director of the
National Museum of American History, said: 'The 1933 Double Eagle is a symbol
of a shared struggle in an interdependent global economy, both in the early
20th century and today.

'We are delighted to make one of the
greatest treasures of the Smithsonian available to European audiences as part
of this unprecedented tour.'

The free exhibition will be open to the
public at Goldsmiths' Hall in Foster Lane, London, between 10am and 4pm on
Saturday, March 3 and Sunday, March 4.

Originator: Franklin Roosevelt took the coins out of circulation in a bid to shore up the ailing U.S. banking system

Pursued by Secret Service agents for over 60 years... and then 10 Double Eagles turn up in Philadelphia

The
mysterious $20 Double Eagles have been pursued for over 60 years by Secret Service agents 
determined to take them out of circulation.

The intrigue surrounding them was reignited last August following a lengthy court battle when ten of the ultra-rare coins were found in a  Philadelphia family jewellers.

Double Eagles were first minted in 1850 with a face value of $20.

But the 
445,500 coins minted in 1933 were never put into circulation because newly inaugurated 
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an order prohibiting the 
release of gold from the Mint.

Collector: King Farouk of Egypt (1920-1965) acquired one of the coins which was subsequently sold after his deposition

The move was a desperate measure to rescue the 
banking system, which was in danger of collapsing as people withdrew gold as quickly as they could.

All the coins were ordered melted 
down in 1937, but a handful are believed to have survived, including the two handed 
over to the Smithsonian Institution.

In
2003, Joan Langbord, the daughter of a Philadelphia jeweller, said she 
found the ten coins in her father's bank deposit bank after he died.

She said that her father could have acquired them legally, perhaps through a trade of gold scrap.

Langbord and
her son, Roy, notified the Mint of the discovery and asked 
officials asked to authenticate the coins.

The mint confirmed they were genuine, then confiscated the coins.

Speaking at the time David Lebryk, acting director of the Mint, had announced in a news 
release that the rare coins, which were never put in circulation, had 
been taken from the Mint 'in an unlawful manner' in the mid-1930s and 
now were 'recovered.'

The coins, which are so rare that their value is almost beyond calculation, are public property, he said.

After
a lengthy legal battle, last month a jury finally decided the coins 
belonged to government and would not be returned to the family.

Speaking to MSNBC, Robert W. Hoge, 
curator of North American coins and currency at the American Numismatic 
Society said: 'The government has been fanatical about seizing and 
destroying these coins.

'They’re famous because the government has been seizing them since the 1940s.'

Jay Brahin, an investment adviser who has been collecting coins since he was a boy in Philadelphia, added: 'The 1933 Double Eagle is one of the most intriguing coins of all time.

Mystery: Israel Switt, seen here in 1944, is believed to have illicitly obtained some of the coins, according to mint officials

'It’s a freak. The coins shouldn’t have been minted, but they were.

'They weren’t meant to circulate, but
some did. And why has the government pursued them so arduously? That’s 
one of the mysteries.'

In 2002, Sotheby's and numismatic firm Stack's auctioned off a 1933 
Double Eagle coin for $7.6million, the highest price ever paid for a 
coin.

That Double Eagle, which is believed to have been part of a 
collection belonging to King Farouk of Egypt, surfaced when a coin 
dealer tried selling it to undercover Secret Service agents.

After a legal battle, the dealer was permitted to sell the coin at 
auction on the condition he split the proceeds with the Mint.

The
Mint contends Israel Switt obtained a cache of the gold coins from his 
connections at the Mint just before they were to be reduced to bullion 
in 1937.

Switt
admitted in 1944 that he had sold nine Double Eagle coins, but he was 
not charged in connection with those transactions, according to the 
Mint.
