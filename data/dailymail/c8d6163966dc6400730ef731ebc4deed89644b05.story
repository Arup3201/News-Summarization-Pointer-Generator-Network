A transgender woman has spoken of her struggle to find work after she was sacked from her job in a factory for wearing too much make-up and then rejected by the boss of a cosmetics shop.

Pammy Rose, who hit the headlines when she reached the final of a beauty contest without organisers realising she had been born a boy, says she has applied for hundreds of jobs but that no one wants to employ her.

The 22-year-old, of Seaham, County Durham, who was born Paul Witten, has now been left with anxiety and depression due to the stress of job hunting.

Transgender beauty queen Pammy Rose chose her name after hearing a joke likening her to Baywatch beauty Pamela Anderson. The 22-year-old has spoken out about her difficulty in trying to find work

She said: 'I tell people I am transgender as I am not going to hide who I really am. I have tried so hard to get a job but I feel like I am being discriminated against because people do not see me as a woman.

'When I went for an interview at a beauty shop the man interviewing me said he liked me and could see me working there.

'When I told him I was transgender his face dropped and I didn't hear from him again.

'I have applied to work in other shops where I live but I never hear anything back. I know it is because I am transgender.

'I have been trying to get a job for years now. I have sent out so many CVs but nobody replies to me.'

The blonde first hit the headlines when she made it to the final of a beauty pageant without revealing that she has been born a boy

Pammy, who was born Paul, started bleaching her hair, wearing makeup and a girls' uniform by the age of 14. She become Pammy Rose officially at the age of 18

Pammy first told her mother, Julie, 49, that she did not want to be in her male body at the age of four.

As a young boy called Paul, Pammy would dance and play with barbies and hated the idea of mud or football.

The blonde said: 'When I was younger I was very feminine.I would wear heels and run around the house with a t-shirt on my head pretending it was hair.

'I would tell my mam I'm a girl and I don't belong in this body. I think she thought I was just going to be gay.'

Pammy Rose was born Paul Witton and knew she didn't wanted to be male aged four. She embraced her femininity aged 14 and is currently on an NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery

During secondary school Pammy was singled out and targeted by bullies.

She said: 'I was a tranny, puff, sick, a freak, they would call me all sorts of names. I was threatened and humiliated so much that I was scared to leave the house.

'I would never say anything back. I felt like a freak as nobody understood me.'

But at the age of 14, Pammy decided to embrace who she really was. She started growing and bleaching her hair, wearing make-up full time and wearing the girls' uniform instead of the boys.

Pammy said: 'I would constantly be upset and tell my mum I was trapped in the wrong body.

'Once I came out and told everyone I was a woman, everything became a lot easier.'

Over the next three years Pammy travelled with her mother and stepfather Ray to London and later Leeds for monthly meetings with psychologists and doctors.

A joke about her looking like Pamela Anderson soon led to her officially changing her name and at the age of 18 she became Pammy Rose.

The following year, at the age of 19, she started taking hormones.

In spring 2013 when she was 20-years-old she was entered into a local beauty contest - The Face of Sunderland - by a friend and made it to the final without the organisers realising she was transgender.

Pammy said:'Until I told them in my interview, the organisers said they didn't even know I was transgender.

'I felt like I had to tell them because I really wanted to promote different people entering the competition.'

Pammy has spent years looking for a job and after countless rejections finally got a role working in a food factory in January 2014.

She said: 'In the interview I told them I was transgender and needed to wear make up to feel confident.

'I agreed to tone it down because of hygiene rules and they were fine with it.' 

But after ten months of working there Pammy was outraged to receive a phone call from the company telling her they were letting her go as she wore too much make up.

The beauty queen was fired from her food factory job because the amount of make-up she wore was 'unhygienic'. She says she has sent out hundreds of CVs but that people don't want to employ a transgender

She said: 'I had toned my make-up down quite a bit, but not wearing any at all is just not an option for me. I am unable to feel confident without it.They told me it was unhygienic.

'I was devastated. I felt I was good at it. I couldn't understand why they had let me go. The factory hadn't mentioned my make-up was a problem prior to this.'

Pammy used her jobseekers allowance to help her apply to many sales assistant posts and admin jobs but did not hear anything back.

When Pammy was given an interview for a make-up store in August 2014 she was excited at the possibility of being employed.

But when she was unsuccessful in her application she was diagnosed with depression by her GP.

Today Pammy is on an NHS waiting list for gender reassignment surgery and hopeful that she might be featuring in Big Brother 2015.

She said: 'I hope one day I will find a job and an employer who will accept me for being me.'
