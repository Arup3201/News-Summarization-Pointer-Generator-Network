For years it was a time-honoured tradition: families would wrap a fiver around a milk bottle to thank the postman at Christmas, or slip a few quid to the binmen for a festive drink.

But today as few as half of UK households still tip tradespeople at Christmas, a new study has found.

Just over a fifth of people tip their hairdresser, while postmen are the next most like trade to receive a festive tip (22 per cent) followed by binmen (15 per cent) and window cleaners (12 per cent).

Milkmen are at the bottom of the list (11 per cent) although this is most likely to reflect the dwindling number of residents who have milk delivered to their door.

The older generations are most likely to tip, the study found, with 54.8 per cent of those aged 55 and above saying they tip, compared to 45.3 per cent of 18-24 year olds.

But Londoners are the most generous, with 16.9 per cent of those who tip giving more than a tenner, in comparison to 1.3 per cent in East Anglia.

People living in the West Midlands are most likely to dip their hand in their pocket for the postman at Christmas, while London residents are more likely to tip their binmen during the festive period than people elsewhere in the country.

Budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, who conducted the study, found 15 per cent of people tip their binmen

Of those who do tip, the majority (65 per cent) give up to £10, 6.4 per cent give more than £10 and 28 per cent prefer to give something other than cash, like food or drink.

Budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, who conducted the study, suggested the low level of tipping could be due to increasing pressures on household budgets.

Ian Williams, director of communications at budgeting account provider Thinkmoney, said: 'The Christmas box is a lovely tradition and a great way to show your appreciation to hard working tradespeople.

'But with household budgets under increasing pressure it is perhaps no surprise that less than half of those we questioned leave a tip nowadays.'
