Authorities say an Amtrak train hit a vehicle that was apparently driving on train tracks late on Sunday in Massachusetts, killing three people.

Amtrak train 132 from Washington, D.C. 
was bound for Boston late Sunday night when it slammed into an SUV around midnight, causing the train to derail.

Three people in the SUV were killed, two males and one female. Their names and ages have not been released.It’s still not clear where the car entered the tracks.

Authorities said at a news conference late Monday morning that the scene is at least a mile long and difficult to access.

'What
 we have is a very large crime scene, we have a very long extended 
investigation ahead of us, and we really can’t get into it too much 
beyond that point,' Mansfield police chief Ron Sellon told reporters.

Authorities had previously said two died in the accident in Mansfield, which forced Amtrak to temporarily cancel some service to and from Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, on Monday morning.

Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for the Bristol County district attorney, confirmed the new details Monday.

Miliote says officials are still working to identify the victims, and that investigators are expected to be at the site most of the day probing the crash.

None of the 180 passengers or crew on the Amtrak train, which was heading to Boston from Washington, were injured.

Mansfield is about 25 miles southwest of Boston.

Amtrak Acela Express and Northeast Regional service between Boston and Providence was suspended, but resumed just after 7 a.m. as trains used the adjacent tracks.

There were also delays on the MBTA’s Providence and Stoughton line.
