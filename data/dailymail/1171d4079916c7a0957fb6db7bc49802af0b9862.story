Chief Trunk bags, a luxury luggage purveyor that was considered the American Louis Vuitton of the early 20th century has now been relaunched with a new generation in mind.

Following a 50-year hiatus from public consciousness, the label is now poised to restore its famous 'Chief' canvas stripe to the glory it once held during the 'golden age of travel.'

The brand has been painstakingly reconfigured by new owners who have translated its formal, pre-aviation-friendly trunks into a range of tote and weekend bags for the modern traveler.

The chief: Konrad Duchek and Michael Sambrano have relaunched the Oshkosh Trunk Company as Chief Trunk bags, with duffle bags (above), weekenders, and totes for all-American travelers

In its heyday, Chief Trunk was actually known as The Oshkosh Trunk Company, named for its origin hometown of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, an early 20th century hub for creative manufacturing.

The brand was revered for its trunks: wheel-less luggage, that while now considered clunky and unrealistic, were once a necessary component of luxury travel in its early days. Their distinctive red and yellow 'Chief' stripe, first introduced in 1898, served in lieu of a monogram.

The label honed its prestige at a time when international travel was just finding its footing among society’s elite, whose extended trips on luxury ocean liners required large, and equally lofty luggage.

New owners Konrad Duchek and Michael Sambrano, New York businessmen with deep roots in the fashion industry and affection for elevated travel, see the label as a prime example of the era's travel fever.

‘The brand grew up during the golden age of travel when people were traveling around the world, and what [brand] your trunk was said something about you,’ Duchek told MailOnline by phone. ‘It’s kind of the same idea as what your bag says about you now.’

Sambrano added that in its peak, Oshkosh embodied the early, ‘romantic concept of traveling the world.’

The original: The Oshkosh Trunk Company made its name with classic luggage baring its signature 'chief' stripe

It was considered America’s own answer to Louis Vuitton, with 
trunks selling for up to $600 (or approximately $10,000 today, with inflation). The brand maintained independent boutiques in New York, Paris, and 
London.

‘Among the American population Oshkosh likely had a better reputation than Louis Vuitton, as there was not as much globalization then,’ Duchek said.

That influence peaked in the early 1930s, and the brand closed soon thereafter in the early 1960s.

While traveling for work as Chanel’s U.S. director of business and planning, Duchek discovered bits of Oshkosh remnants in a vintage luggage stall at Paris’s famous flea market, Marché aux puces de Clignancourt.

But his run-in with the Oshkosh relics was somewhat of a nostalgic blast from the past. ‘My parents had two of the old suitcases and I sort of grew up with the brand around as a kid,’ he told us of his history with the label. ‘I was in Paris and suddenly saw this striped trunk and thought “Wait a minute, I know what this is.”

His reintroduction to the label soon turned into ‘a person quest’ to restart Oshkosh. ‘There was such a rich history of design, I was like, “Wait, why hasn’t anyone dealt with this?”’ he said.

For everyday: Duchek and Sambrano have also created classic carry-all (L) and zip-up (R) tote bags for their shoppers' everyday needs.

The label’s intellectual property 
rights had expired, rendering its 'Chief' stripe, among other signatures, 
as public domain. Duchek ventured to Oshkosh ‘to see if there was a 
viable business,’ and re-trademarked all of the brand’s associated 
signatures, as well as its name.

He decided that Oshkosh was the perfect opportunity to link up with Sambrano, who he had already worked together on multiple fashion and luxury goods projects in the past.

But rather than reestablish Oshkosh as a 
luggage brand built for trips on chartered yachts and steam locomotives,
Duchek and Sambrano ‘reinvented the brand as it would exist today, 
revolving around the American good life,’ the latter partner said. 
‘’It’s not a jet set life, but it’s something we all aspire to—the idea 
of journeys and jaunts, more weekend destinations that revolve around 
social circles of friends.’

Positioning: The original Oshkosh luggage was 'inconspicuous in circles where essential niceties are taken for granted and only shortcomings are remarked,' reads an advertisement dating back to the early 20th century

They renamed the label ‘Chief Trunk 
Brands’ to avoid confusion with children's retailer Oshkosh B'Gosh, which is considered Oshkosh, Wisconsin’s best-known surviving export.

The label’s nucleus, its distinctive red 
and yellow ‘Chief’ stripe, took nearly a year to redevelop. ‘We 
basically pulled it apart thread by thread to match the weight and 
color, it was a whole process,’ Sambrano said.

Taking
direct inspiration from the ‘Chief’, the duo has created
a range of carry-all’s, totes, weekenders and duffle bags fit for 
seersucker-wielding, Duke graduates on a quick weekend journey to Rhode 
Island’s foxtail-strewn coastline.

The bags-- manufactured in the Brooklyn Navy Yard of mostly American-made materials--range in price from $65 for a change purse to $1,095 for a leather-trimmed weekender. At present, they are exclusively retailed through Chief Trunk's own e-commerce site.

Comparative work: At the height of its popularity, Oshkosh Trunks had an American cachet comparable to that of Louis Vuitton luggage in France

But
what sets the Chief designs apart from other weekenders is their 
decidedly tailored feel. Unlike many canvas rucksacks on the market, the
designs feel like they would fit in better at an inn on Newport’s Bowen 
Wharf than at a quaint motel near the Brooklyn population’s favorite 
artsy upstate weekend destination, the Dia:Beacon galleries.

‘We
didn’t want something too hipster or too young for it to have some 
heart to it,’ Sambrano elaborated. ‘We definitely did want to be 
different and bring back the glamour.’

Duchek summed it up, adding: ‘We want to be a modern brand that has great heritage rather than just a heritage brand.’
