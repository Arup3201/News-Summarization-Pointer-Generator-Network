She may have retired from professional swimming back in 2007, but Princess Charlene of Monaco proved she's still a water baby at heart this weekend.

The Princess of Monaco, 35, got back in the pool to teach a swimming class on Saturday at the Olimpiysky Sports Complex in Moscow, Russia.

The Mon√©gasque princess
taught the group of enthusiastic children how to swim.

She wasn't afraid to get her hair wet and really got stuck in, donning goggles to teach butterfly stroke, as well as showing the children how to kick off from the edge.

She is passionate about swimming and her own charity, The Princess Charlene 
Foundation, aims to
help women and children on five of the world's seven continents, with one of 
the focal points being awareness of water safety.

'Some of 
my present and future projects for my foundation are underlining the 
importance and reinforcing the awareness of water safety,' writes Charlene on her charity's website.

'We are all aware of horrible stories about small children drowning because they could not swim.

'Teaching them how to swim could save
their lives, and the importance and awareness will help them to feel 
more comfortable and confident in all aquatic areas as well.'

She
represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with her team 
finishing fifth in the Women's 4x100 m Medley. She retired from 
competitive swimming in 2007.

Her commitment to the sport, though, seems unwavering.

The princess is 
reportedly set to donate a 'large amount' to ensure her home town of Durban, 
South Africa, 
becomes the premier city for swimming in the country.

It has been a busy week for Princess Charlene. The 35-year-old royal was in Paris last Monday where she took her prime position seat on the front row at the Akris spring/summer 14 show in the French capital.

She looked flawless in a structured black dress and dazzling diamonds and pearls.

The princess is a firm fan of the 
Swiss fashion label, which specialises in luxury goods for women and was
founded by Alice Kriemler-Schoch.

The wife of Albert II, Prince of Monaco has a short list of designer labels that she favors and Akris is right at the top.

The princess seemed in great spirits in both Russia and Paris after finally putting rumours to bed over the 'turbulent' start to her marriage.

Jet-setter: Princess Charlene had also been in Paris last week to watch one of her favourite designer's catwalk shows

She said in an interview last month that the tears streaming down her cheeks at her wedding 
to Albert in 2011 were not the result of a series of rows 
over his womanising ways, but in fact tears of happiness.

She
described this speculation, as well as rumours she attempted to escape 
in the days leading up to her wedding, as 'categorical lies'.
