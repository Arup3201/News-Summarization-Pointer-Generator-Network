A Utah high school senior was forbidden from attending her school's Valentine's Day dance because it was for couples only - and she didn't have a date. 

Friends Josee Stetich, Mikayla Robertson and Shivani Lindmeir, who are all 18-year-old students at Bountiful High School, had planned to go to the dance as friends when they did not get dates to the 'Sweethearts Dance'.

But when they arrived at the Utah State Fairgrounds in Salt Lake City, school officials said only Lindmeir and Robertson could attend because they had bought a ticket together.

But Stetich could not attend solo.

'They said "No, you can't come in, because you don't have a date,"' Stetich told KUTV. 

Stetich was willing to pay the $30 couple's ticket price, but administrators wouldn't budge.  

'I didn't get asked to the dance, which is fine,' she said. 'I love hanging out with my girls. It would've been fun.' 

Stetich said she had never heard of the rule before. 

The girls said it was a disappointing blow after they had spent the entire day getting ready and going out to dinner in anticipation for the event. 

'I didn't get asked to the dance, which is fine,' Stetich said. 'I love hanging out with my girls. It would've been fun' 

'We got our hair done, put on nice gowns and Josee even bought new shoes,' Robertson told ABC News.  

'We wanted to look our best and be dressed and ready as though we would have had a date.' 

The school refunded Robertson and Lindmeir's ticket and the three girls toured a nearby chocolate factory instead.

Bountiful High School Principal Greg Wilkey, who confirmed the dance was only for couples, told KUTV he was informed by assistant principal Sue Baylis that the three girls left 'voluntarily' after their tickets were refunded, and that there were 'no protests' from the students or their parents. 

'Sue said none of the girls were upset or protested,' Wilkey said in a statement. 'They knew it was couples only, but they were hoping for a pass.' 

But Stetich said all her friends, and their parents, were upset. And they believe the school policy should be changed. 

'It's not a necessary rule,' she said. 'People don't get asked to dances, and sometimes plans change.'
