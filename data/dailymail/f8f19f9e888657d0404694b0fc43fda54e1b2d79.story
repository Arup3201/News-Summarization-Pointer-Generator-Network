Americans sweltered in the scorching heat today as temperature records continued to fall across the country.

Friday was officially the hottest day of the year in scores of cities across the country as the heatwave covered a million square miles, affecting 141million Americans.

New York's Manhattan experienced the hottest ever July 22 recorded, with an overwhelming 104-degree temperature in Central Park.

The Washington DC region continued to be smothered in heat and humidity with temperatures reaching 102 degrees but with a heat index of more than 120 - hotter than Death Valley at daybreak.

In Newark, New Jersey, temperatures 
peaked at 108F, the highest ever recorded since records began in 1931 and
the hottest reported by the National Weather Service on the east coast.

In Oklahoma city, residents experienced the 27th straight day of triple-figure temperatures and in 
Maryland, the mercury hit 108F.

Triple-digit temperatures were recorded 
in Islip, Long Island, which is usually cooled by Atlantic breezes, 
Philadelphia, Allentown and Reading in Pennsylvania, Georgetown in 
Delaware, Boston, Massachusetts, the East Coast gambling mecca of 
Atlantic City in New Jersey, and Baltimore in Maryland.

Even Bangor, Maine, which lies at the same latitude as Montreal in 
Canada, reached a record for the calendar day of 97F.

'Bullseyes of high heat and humidity' 
were affecting the central states and most of the East Coast, said Chris
Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Weather Service.

Severe storm and excessive heat warnings
were put in place for this evening and forecasters said to expect the 
same for the rest of the weekend.

And as the nation seeks solace in the cool indoors, power companies struggle to cope with the high demand.

In New York by mid afternoon, Con Ed 
recorded a peak of 13,182 megawatts, surpassing the previous record, 
with demand expected to increase as the scorching weather continues 
throughout the day.

A Con Ed spokesman said they even expected to set a new record every hour as the heat index was set to peak between 4pm and 7pm.

More than 10,000 people were without power on Friday afternoon with more outages expected throughout the weekend

The typical temperature for this time of year is 85 degrees and Mayor Bloomberg congratulated Con Ed on doing a good job.

He said: 'Con Ed's done a great job 
so far. We think this will be the most stressful day on the electric 
grid in recent history - maybe ever.'

And there is to be no respite on 
Saturday with temperatures expected to reach triple figures again in 
most cities across the northeast.

The National Weather Service issued 
excessive heat warnings for a huge section of the country from Kansas to
Maine, forecasting temperatures near or at triple digits on Friday and into
the weekend.

The heatwave has so far claimed at 
least 24 lives as it stretches into its seventh day, and energy firms 
are warning parts of the country could face rolling blackouts as they 
struggle to keep up with demand.

Forecasters said the high temperatures and stifling  humidity - with barely a breath of wind - will force up the heat indexes.

But
New Yorkers hoping to beat the heat were thwarted by warnings urging 
them to avoid city waterways after a wastewater treatment plant disabled by fire began spewing millions of gallons of raw sewage into the Hudson River.

Officials
cautioned against swimming and bathing at Staten Island's South Beach, 
Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach, and Brooklyn's Sea Gate beach, 
especially for people with medical conditions.

City
officials opened 500 cooling centres across the five boroughs, to allow
residents without air conditioning to escape the stifling temperatures.
They also warned elderly people and anybody with health problems to 
keep out of the heat.

Yesterday
it was so hot subway countdown clocks were turned off as officials 
expected temperatures in underground equipment rooms to reach 120F, 
which could damage equipment.

Across the country, emergency room 
visits are soaring, according to public health officials, mainly because
of people suffering from heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

The weather is suspected of contributing to at least 22 deaths nationwide.

At
least six more fatalities were reported yesterday, including a Michigan
restaurant cook who suffered a heart attack after being sent home from 
his job and a teenage boy who drowned while swimming at summer camp in 
the same state.

In 
Pittsburgh, a man was stuck on a roof for almost two hours because the 
hot tar he'd been using stopped him from climbing to safety.

A blown electrical transformer in the 
Detroit suburb of Ferndale forced several senior citizens to spent 
Wednesday night in the community room of their six-story apartment 
building after the power failed.

On Thursday morning, Lisa Blumentritt ventured back into her third-floor unit.

She said:  'You couldn't breathe. It's like 100 outside and 110 degrees inside. I couldn't go back there. This is extreme.'

In Connecticut, a dozen Girl Scouts 
were treated for heat-related problems at a scout camp. None of the 
girls required hospitalisation, but New Fairfield First 
Selectman John Hodge says they spent Thursday night in the camp's 
cafeteria after workers brought in industrial fans to help cool them 
off.

AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski
told the New York Post the high temperatures are likely to linger until
Sunday, because of an unusual high-pressure system acting like a heat 
dome.

He said: 'You have high pressure at most levels of the atmosphere. Not only is it warm at the 
surface, it's also warm upstairs [in the upper atmosphere]. That creates
a very stable atmosphere.'

The National Weather Service said the U.S. hit 55 record highs on Wednesday, including Walsh, 
Colorado, at 104; Garden City, Kansas, at 108; and Gage, Oklahoma, at 
107, according to early reports.

The oppressive temperatures are expected to intensify on Friday.

The
National Weather Service issued excessive heat warnings across the 
Midwest and East Coast, forecasting the heat index could reach up to 
115 degrees on Saturday.

AccuWeather.com
forecaster Mary Yoon told MSNBC.com: 'Through the rest of this week and
into the weekend at least 15 states starting from the Southern Plains 
and Midwest and much of the Northeast will witness 90 degree plus 
temperatures with high humidity.'

Those
cities include Tulsa, Oklaholma, St Louis, Missouri, Buffalo, New York 
and Washington, D.C., among others, according to the weather service.

Experts say while temperatures are expected to soar into the triple digits, no relief is in sight through the weekend.

The extraordinary heat is likely to put a huge strain on power. John Miksad, senior vice president of 
Electric Operations for Con Ed, said New York City would likely set 
electricity demand records in coming days.

He told NBC New York: 'We're going to be in new territory, and for us that translates into a very high demand for electricity. This is day one of a three-day battle for us.'

Mr Miksad said Con Edison has additional
personnel standing by in the case of heat-related emergencies. The 
company is asking customers to set thermostats above 78 degrees with 
health concerns are not an issue.

They are also asking customers to turn 
off lights in empty rooms and withhold from running appliances until 
after 10pm whenever possible.

An excessive heat warning is in effect 
through Friday evening for the five boroughs, the lower Hudson Valley 
and Rockland and Westchester counties in New York and across New Jersey.

Experts say highs Saturday are expected to hit the mid-90s before dropping to the mid-80s on Sunday.

The National Weather Service is 
encouraging residents to limit their time outdoors when possible, wear 
light-weight, loose-fitting clothing and hydrate.

They also urge people to educate themselves about the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
