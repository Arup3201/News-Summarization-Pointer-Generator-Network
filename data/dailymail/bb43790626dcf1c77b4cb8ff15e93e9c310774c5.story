Gary Neville believes the likes of new club captain Wayne Rooney, Robin Van Persie and Michael Carrick need to step up to lead a Manchester United recovery following the exit of several club legends this summer.

New manager Louis Van Gaal had a disastrous start on Saturday as United lost 2-1 to Swansea at Old Trafford.

The Dutchman is tasked with returning the Red Devils back to their glory days without stalwarts such as long-standing captain Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra and the retired Ryan Giggs.

Former United right-back Neville highlights the importance of new leaders emerging at Old Trafford to cope with the club’s transformation.

‘Big personalities like Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic have gone, and new leaders and characters need to emerge in the dressing room,’ said Neville in his ambassador's column in the United Review.

‘This is now the opportunity for [the likes of] Phil Jones, David De Gea, Juan Mata, Ander Herrera - players who've been signed - to become leaders and develop the mentality that they want to take over the mantle.

Gone: Centre-back Rio Ferdinand has departed Old Trafford to start a new challenge at Queens Park Rangers

‘That's particularly true for the ones who have been there for a period of time. Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher and Jonny Evans are the five obvious players who have won many honours between them, now they need to step up.

Louis van Gaal is leading the way and Neville feels the former Holland manager has the vast wealth of experience to create and nurture that evolution within the squad.

‘The main thing is that the manager is a fantastic leader in his own right,’ added Neville, ‘so he will demand that his players take more responsibility out on the pitch.’
