Tattoos are painful at the best of times, but this one must have seriously hurt.

Chilean striker Mauricio Pinilla recently got his 119th-minute World Cup miss against Brazil etched into his back.

Next to the image of his shot slamming off the crossbar, it reads: 'One centimeter from glory.'

The striker posted a series of photos of his tattoo experience to his Twitter page

Pinilla's tattoo echoes the frustration of most Chileans.

Thousands of them jumped up in the stands at Mineirao Stadium - and millions more at home - on Saturday in the final moments only to watch Pinilla's shot hit the bar.

The story is well-known by now: Brazil ended up winning, Chile was sent home in tears and the post has quickly turned into a loathed symbol of the country's 14-year jinx against Brazil.

The two teams had met three times in previous World Cups, with Brazil winning in the 1962 tournament in Chile, then in France 1998 and South Africa 2010.

Strangely, Pinilla also got 'Blessed for Life' tattooed in English on his forehead at the same time.

'He said it was an inerasable wound,' tattoo artist Marlon Parra told 
newspaper La Tercera.

'That he hasn't stopped thinking about that 
moment, in what could have happened if the ball had been a few 
centimetres lower.'
