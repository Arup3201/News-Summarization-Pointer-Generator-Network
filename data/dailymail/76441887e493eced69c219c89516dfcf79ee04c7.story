Germany will wait until the very last minute before deciding whether to withdraw Munich's rival bid against Wembley to stage the final of Euro 2020.

The German Football Association (DFB) is also planning a bid to host the entire Euro 2024 tournament and is considering dropping its 2020 bid to boost its chances.

DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach has disclosed however that they will wait until the day of the vote on September 19 before deciding whether to pull out of the 2020 race and settle for hosting group games instead.

Niersbach told German newspaper Die Welt: 'There are 19 cities in the race, and we are very confident that Munich is among the 13 places. We will keep our position until the date of decision. What happens then is open.'

'I can confirm that it is our great ambition for the entire Euro 2024 be played in Germany only,' Niersbach added. 'We need no new stadiums for 2024, that is crucial. The investment that was needed before the 2006 World Cup will not be necessary.'

He also dismissed there being a potential conflict of interest with a possible German bid for the summer Olympics in the same year.

'We are very supportive,' Niersbach said: 'There is no competition and we are not competitors.'

UEFA is holding Euro 2020 in 13 different countries to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament and only Wembley and Munich's Allianz Arena have put in bids to host the climax of the competition - the semi-finals and final.

Football Association general secretary Alex Horne last week expressed confidence in Wembley winning the 2020 bid for Wembley and that the FA will consider a bid to host the entire Euro 2028 tournament.
