A teenage mother who dumped her newborn baby in a dumpster moments after giving birth has been given hope of regaining custody of her son.

The 16-year-old, who has not been named, was told during an emergency court hearing that she has a year to prove she is capable of looking after the child.

If she satisfies welfare officers at the end of the process, she may be permanently reunited with the baby.

Resilient: Child protective services was granted temporary custody Wednesday of a newborn found alive in a Houston dumpster Tuesday morning. The mother has been identified as a 16-year-old who says she didn't know she was pregnant

In the meantime, a judge has granted the 
student at South Houston High School, Texas, access to the baby 
discovered in a sack of rubbish on Tuesday.

The mother insisted she thought the 
child was dead when she threw him into the dumpster, a Child Protective 
Services caseworker said in Houston during a court hearing on Wednesday.

The
 caseworker testified in an emergency custody hearing that the girl 
didn't even know she was pregnant when she went into labor and gave 
birth in her apartment bathtub.

After giving birth, the teen cut the boy's umbilical cord herself but thought her son was dead so placed him in the dumpster.

Texan law states that the girl and her family still have rights to the child if they wish to pursue custody.

In safe hands: The next court hearing for the 16-year-old Houston girl who left her newborn baby in a dumpster earlier this week is scheduled for March 7

'She's
 the biological mother and until rights are terminated (through the 
judicial process) until then she's got rights to the baby, Child 
Protective Services spokesperson Estelle Olguin told KHOU.com.

Harris County Juvenile Court Associate Judge Angela Ellis has given permission for the mother to visit her son who has been placed in foster care.

Who gets final custody of the child will now be decided through protracted legal proceedings, during which the mother will undergo psychological assessments to see if she is fit to look after he son.

The next court hearing is scheduled for March 7.

The court has a year to decide if the baby goes up for adoption or is returned to the girl and her extended family.

The teen's mother lives in Alvin, but she had been staying with her aunt while attending South Houston High School.

She said she has not spoken to her son's 22-year-old father in about six months.

A judge awarded CPS temporary custody of the child, but said she would allow the mother to visit the newborn if the attorney assigned to represent the baby agrees.

The caseworker asked the mom if she wanted to name her son, and she chose Carlos after the man who found the baby and saved his life.

The boy was found on Tuesday morning at the Reserve Apartments by maintenance worker Carlos Michel, who heard what sounded like cat mewing coming from the dumpster.

Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework

He investigated further and found the baby boy alive, stuffed in a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework.

Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive.

The boy was found purple and struggling to breath. But he is now in a good condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital.

The mother was also taken to the hospital for examination after being identified. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges.

Both were still in the hospital as of Wednesday night, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Texas has a special law to help new mothers who can't take care of their children.

The Baby Moses law states that a babies up to 60-days-old can be dropped off without fear of prosecution at any hospital, fire station or ambulance station - as long as the baby is handed off to a person.

CPS is currently trying to figure out if there are any other family members who can look after the boy when he gets out of the hospital, or if he'll need to be placed in the foster care system.
