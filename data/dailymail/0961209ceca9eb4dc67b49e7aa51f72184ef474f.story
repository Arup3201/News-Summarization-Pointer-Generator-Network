Three sisters who found out they were all pregnant in the same month have all given birth - within 51 days of each other.

Kerry Harwood, 29, Jodie Manning, 28, and Carla Manning, 26, from Ashford, Kent, were surprised to discover they were all expecting in August last year.

The babies – little boy Laelan, and girls Laici and Evarna – were born on 7 April, 18 April and 28 May respectively.

Youngest sister Carla, an admin 
assistant, was the first to give birth. Her son Laelan weighed in at 7lb
 1oz and she says he was the speediest of all three births.

Eleven days after Laelan’s arrival, on 18 April, middle sister Jodie gave 
birth to daughter Laici.

Laici weighed a healthy 8lb when she was born.

Nursery practitioner Jodie already has a daughter Taila, six, from a previous relationship. Her current partner, Byron Bradley, 28, a construction 
worker, was by Jodie's side when she gave birth to their daughter Laici.

 Jaya, none, Isara, six and Harlan, two, with businessman husband James 
Harwood, 30.

Her daughter Evarna was born at 1.06am on May 28, weighing 8lb 10oz.

‘I couldn’t wait for my baby to come,’ says Kerry.

‘I loved holding the other two and spending time with them. The children are getting on well.

‘My son Harlan has been a bit of a pickle. He was the baby for so long and now there are suddenly three new ones around.

‘Evarna was a little chunk when she was born, she was a very healthy weight and she's just so sweet.’

Adds Carla: ‘Its been nice having them so close because we can compare weights and check-ups.’

Carla and partner Wayne Penfold, 31, a salesman, already have a one year-old son Codee.

As for the girl’s mother, Julia Young, 55, is now a proud grandmother of eight.

She flew to Ashford from Texas to attend all three births – and possibly fitted in a few rounds of babysitting.
