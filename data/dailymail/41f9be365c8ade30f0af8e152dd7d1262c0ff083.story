The first winners of the world's biggest lottery payoff have begun to emerge as they share a €2.5billion (£1.96billion) pot of cash to be divided among thousands of Spanish ticketholders.

Neighbourhoods in towns and cities across Spain erupted with Champagne-soaked scenes of joy as it dawned on this year's lucky winners that they had scooped the €400,000 (£314,000) first prize of Spain's 'El Gordo' (The Fat One) Christmas lottery.

Unlike lotteries that offer one large jackpot, Spain's yuletide drawing sprinkles a variety of winnings on thousands of ticketholders. 

Spaniards who bought lottery tickets in an upper middle class Madrid neighborhood were among the first to celebrate today, cracking open bottles of champagne on the streets as they celebrated winning.

Tickets bearing the lucky first prize number 13437, in what is known as El Gordo - the Fat One - were sold from Lanzarote, in the Canary Islands, to La Coruna, on the north-west tip of mainland Spain.

They were sold from the province of Cadiz, just west of Gibraltar, to Barcelona on the Mediterranean coast, just south of the French frontier. A handful of winners came from Valencia on the east coast and in the small town of Coria, a few miles from the Portuguese frontier. 

Others came from more than a dozen other places across the country including Madrid, the capital.

In fact Madrid received the biggest single share of the 160 first prizes, each of four million euros - £3.12million. A total of 118 of those first prize tickets, mostly sold in tenth shares costing €20 (£15) each came from one single lottery shop in the heart of the city.

Tales of joy and celebration are widely broadcast on TV stations, providing Spain's struggling population a rare moment of relief after another year of a brutal financial crisis.

Restaurant employee Joana Lizcano beamed as she soaked in the reality of winning the big one after coming to Spain from Colombia as a poor immigrant 14 years ago.

'The first thing I'll do is take my five-year-old daughter to the Disney theme park in Paris,' said Lizcano, 28. 'Then I'll pay the debts I have and try to buy an apartment with my husband.'

Photocopy shop manager Arturo Aguirre said his winning ticket would allow him to buy his way out of the debt he racked up amid the crisis that started easing this year, but still hasn't translated into a major financial turnaround for many Spaniards.

'I'll be able to plug the holes that I've got,' Aguirre said.

One of the happiest places yesterday was the tiny mountain village of El Bosque, halfway between the sherry capital of Jerez and Ronda, the mountain bullfight town inland from the Costa del Sol.

Twenty full first prize tickets were sold in the village of 2,100 inhabitants - that's 29,714 pounds, 28p for every man, woman and child.

But for the second year everyone who won anything in the lottery will have to pay 20 percent back to the Treasury in tax. Until last year lottery winnings in Spain were tax free.

A single El Gordo ticket costs €200 (£168), but normally whole communities share a ticket. Most punters buy a tenth of a ticket at €20.
