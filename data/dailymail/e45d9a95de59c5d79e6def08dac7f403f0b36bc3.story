Two years ago Ben McMahon woke up from a coma more than a week after a horrific car crash that almost claimed his life only being able to speak Mandarin.

The 22-year-old remembers how he woke up and saw a nurse who looked Asian standing by his bed and said to her 'Excuse me nurse, I feel really sore here' in Chinese.

He then asked the nurse for a piece of paper and pen and he wrote on it in Mandarin: 'I love my mum, I love my dad, I will recover.'

Two years ago Ben McMahon was involved in car crash that left in a coma for more than a week

His new-found language skills baffled his doctors as well as his parents.

Ben's father, Mark, and his mother were told it would be a miracle if their son survived.

'We got the call from the hospital and [the hospital staff member] was saying "Oh Mark, look I just wanted to ring and let you know that Ben's actually started to come out of the coma"...and she said, “I don’t know how to say this...he's speaking Mandarin'," Mark told Channel 10's The Project.

'Neither of us can speak Mandarin so we just nodded but deep down quite concerned about what’s going on.'

When he woke up, he was only able to speak fluent Mandarin - having only learned it at school

The 22-year-old along with his parents appeared on Channel Ten's The Project to tell his story

Despite taking Mandarin at school, Ben had never been fluent at the language.

'I wasn’t consciously thinking I was speaking Mandarin, it was what just came out and it was what was most natural to me,' he said.

It took Ben two or three more days to recall how to speak English.

Since then, Ben's language skills have open new opportunities to him like leading Chinese tours of his hometown and hosting a Mandarin television program.

Now the Melbourne man has moved to Shanghai to study commerce at university.

He said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language.

But what happened to Ben is not the first of its kind.

His parents said they were baffled that he could speak Mandarin as neither of them spoke the Chinese language

His new-found talent for the language led him to appear on a Mandarin television show and he now lives in Shanghai, studying commerce

He said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language

In 2010, a 13-year-old Croatian girl woke up had replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking German.

More recently, a U.S. navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room and had no recollection of who he was and spoke fluent Swedish in July 2013.

But a Queensland Brain Institute neuroscientist thinks he might have an explanation about what happened to Ben.

Dr Pankaj Sah said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language, breathing, speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits.

According to him, what possibly happened to Ben was that the parts of the brain that recalled English were damaged in the crash and those that retained Mandarin were activated when the 22-year-old woke up from his coma.
