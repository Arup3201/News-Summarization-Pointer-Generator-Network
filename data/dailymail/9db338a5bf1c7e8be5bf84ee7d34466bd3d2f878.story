Sinitta quits at eleventh hour

After decades of fame and fortune, they are used to the finer things in life.

But that hasn't deterred a crop of older contestants from deciding to rough it in the jungle in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!

The line-up for the new series is dominated by ageing stars, with four of the ten contestants in their 60s.

Well dressed for the jungle: Lorraine Chase arrives in Brisbane this week ahead of her appearance on I'm A Celebrity.. Get Me Out Of Here!

Hart to Hart actress Stefanie Powers, 
69, comedian Freddie Starr, 68, Emmerdale star Lorraine Chase, 60, and 
former jockey Willie Carson, 68, are swapping creature comforts for the 
challenges and creepy-crawlies of the Australian bush.

Also on the series, which begins on Sunday, are Benidorm actress Crissy Rock, 53, and pop singer Sinitta, 43.

With the average age of this year's 
contestants at 47, show insiders admitted that executives had realised 
viewers like older celebrities because they bring more 'charisma, jokes 
and life experience'.

But they insisted that this year's 
show was cast purely on 'character' and filling it with older 
celebrities had not been a deliberate tactic. It comes after BBC's 
Strictly Come Dancing attracted attention for the number of older women 
on the current series, including Edwina Currie, 64, Anita Dobson, 62, 
Lulu, 62, and Nancy Dell'Olio, 50.

She certainly would have been an entertaining addition to this year's batch of celebrities facing the jungle.

But it has emerged that Sinitta quit I'm A Celebrity... at the last minute.

The singer, 43, was due to fly to Australia this week but pulled out at the eleventh hour.

Sinitta attended a party at Garrard 
jewellery house in London Monday night when she was supposed to be 
preparing for her flight to Brisbane.

As recently as Monday Simon Cowell's
 ex was insisting to ITV bosses that she would go through with show 
despite her phobia of creepie-crawlies, The Daily Star alleges.

But despite attempting to 'train herself' to handle snakes and insects, her morbid fear became too much.

Sinitta's spokesperson told the paper: 'She would have been hilarious but her phobias cause panic attacks.'

And in the past, older contestants on 
I'm A Celebrity have grabbed the most headlines, with Kim Woodburn, 
Gillian McKeith, Jan Leeming and Tony Blackburn among the more memorable
 stars.

A source on the ITV programme said: 
'We don't cast on age, we choose people based on character and 
personality regardless of how old they are.

'But often people that have lived a 
bit bring a bit more in charisma, jokes and life experience. We are 
happy with the mix of people we have got.'

Many of the contestants, including Carson, Starr and Miss Chase, have already landed in Australia to prepare for filming.

Miss Chase said: 'I had a 60th 
birthday in July and ever since then I've been trying to find a 
challenge. I'm A Celebrity is that challenge.'

'I tried to look up various bootcamps 
to tackle this year, but life always gets in the way. At one point, I 
even thought about learning to ride a motorbike, so I researched 
motorbike courses in Wales – but it was getting towards the end of the 
year and I hadn't signed up for anything yet when I heard from the 
producers.'

Looking forward to it? The Only Way Is Essex star Mark Wright and actress Stefanie Powers are also on board

Carson said: 'I'm really looking 
forward to experiencing Australia. However, I'm not prepared for 
roughing it in the jungle. I'm not prepared for the camping aspect of 
it. And I'm really going to miss my bed.'

Starr had a heart attack and underwent
 bypass surgery in April last year. He said: 'I'm so out of shape it's 
unbelievable, but I'll try to lift trees and things like that while I'm 
in the jungle.'

The older contestants will be joined 
by younger faces including Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton, 36, 
The Only Way Is Essex star Mark Wright, 24, Real Hustle presenter 
Jessica-Jane Clement, 26, and McFly bassist Dougie Poynter, 23.

Get ready for a rollercoaster: Fatima Whitbread and Crissy Rock are starring on the show

Last year's show was dominated by the antics of Miss McKeith after she collapsed during one of the trials.

She won little sympathy from her fellow contestants and the audience.

The former accused her of faking her 
collapse and the latter ignored her professed  phobia of 
creepie-crawlies by repeatedly voting for her to take part in the Bush 
Tucker challenges.
