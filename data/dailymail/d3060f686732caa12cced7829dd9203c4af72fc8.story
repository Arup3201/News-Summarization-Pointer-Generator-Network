A measles outbreak believed to have started when an overseas tourist visited Disneyland is sweeping California with the total number of people diagnosed as carrying the virus now at 119. 

Public health authorities have now revealed the particular strain of the virus which many have tested positive for is the same as that which is linked to an outbreak in the Philippines.

The Disneyland resort, located in Anaheim in Southern California, receives millions of visitors a year, many of them coming from overseas.

The strain of measles found in many of those who caught the virus is the same as that currently afflicting the Philippines

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing.

The CDCP warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed.

'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.'

Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.

The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas.

A report by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) researchers said that specimens from 30 of the state's measles patients had been genotyped and that all were of the same strain which caused the Philippines outbreak.

That same genotype has been detected in at least 14
countries and six other U.S. states in the last six months, the
researchers said, and the source of the illness that sickened
visitors at the  theme park has not been identified.

The report was posted on the website of the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and stated the outbreak illustrates the
need for high measles vaccine rates in the U.S.

The outbreak has renewed a debate over the so-called
anti-vaccination movement, in which fears about potential side
effects of vaccines, fueled by now-debunked research suggesting
a link to autism, have prompted a small minority of parents to
refuse inoculations for their children.

Some parents also opt not to have their children vaccinated
for religious or other reasons.

According to the CDPH, 39 of the 119 people who contracted
measles in the state were believed to have been exposed while
visiting Disneyland.

An additional 35 had contacts with those
people in a household or community setting.

The state health department said another 45 cases have an
unknown exposure source but are presumed linked to the
Disneyland outbreak based on a combination of descriptive
epidemiology or strain type.

Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000
after decades of intensive childhood vaccine efforts.

But in
2014, the country had its highest number of cases in two decades.

Most people recover from measles within a few weeks,
although it can be fatal in some cases.
