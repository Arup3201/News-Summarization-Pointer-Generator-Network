Clint Dempsey scored after just 31 seconds and John Brooks powered in a header at the death as USA got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start against Ghana.

The former Fulham frontman put Jurgen Klinsmann’s side ahead in the Group G clash, only for Andre Ayew to haul the Ghanaians level.

However, substitute Brooks landed the decisive blow in the dying seconds when he headed a last-gasp winner.

It ended a run of back-to-back defeats against Ghana after losing in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups and boosted their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages in Brazil.

Dempsey gave the Americans a dream start when he broke the deadlock after just 31 seconds.

Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden).

The Texan, who had a disappointing loan 
spell at Fulham last season, weaved his way through the Ghana defence 
before firing past Adam Kwarasey off the right-hand post.

Ghana creeped into the game and US keeper Tim Howard had to be alert to take the ball off Asamoah Gyan's toes.

However, Jozy Altidore wasted a glorious chance to double USA's lead when his close-range shot was blocked by John Boye.

That proved to be the Sunderland striker's last contribution as he pulled his hamstring shortly after and left the field on a stretcher.

Ghana's Christian Atsu sent an effort over Howard's bar, but the Everton keeper had to get down low to beat away Gyan's long-range effort just after the half-hour mark.

There was another injury scare for the US when Dempsey got caught in the face by Boye's flailing boot, but the Seattle Sounders forward dusted himself down and returned to the field after receiving treatment to a bloody nose.

Jordan Ayew could have levelled in 
stoppage-time, only to fluff his lines from 12 yards when he should have
 forced Howard into a save.

Sulley Muntari flashed a long-range drive wide at the beginning of the second half, while Gyan headed over unmarked from eight yards.

The Ghana captain almost made amends moments later, but his effort was turned around the post by Howard.

Jermaine Jones stung the hands of Kwarasey as Klinsmann’s men made a rare venture forward, while Geoff Cameron’s last-ditch block denied Gyan at the other end.

The 
Africans were camped inside the US half and Kwesi Appiah brought on 
Kevin-Prince Boateng, Michael Essien and Middlesbrough’s Albert Adomah 
as they searched desperately for an equaliser.

And
 their persistence paid off when Gyan’s clever backheel teed-up Andre 
Ayew, who powered a shot past Howard at his near post to level.

However, Brooks popped up with a dramatic winner as Klinsmann celebrated his 50th game in charge with three points.
