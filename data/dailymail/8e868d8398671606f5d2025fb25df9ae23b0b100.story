The BBC has been criticised for allowing staff to mob the Queen and film her on their mobile phones as she toured its revamped HQ.

Buckingham Palace sources said they were struck by ‘how chaotic’ Friday’s visit to Broadcasting House in Central London appeared.

They had been led to believe that staff would remain at their desks and ‘carry on as normal’ in a professional manner – but at every turn she was met by a forest of raised smartphones and tablets.

Speech: Speaking on Radio 4 and the World Service she said how she had been to the original Broadcasting House with her parents before the war and then later before her Coronation, with Prince Philip

Happy: The Queen looked relaxed as Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is 'progressing satisfactorily' after his operation

One observer said staff followed their 87-year-old visitor around  like ‘zombies’.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, said: ‘It is just depressing that these people don’t know how to behave, it is very rude and offensive.

‘The BBC should have told their staff there should be absolutely no filming on mobile phones. I’d be livid if I was the Queen.

‘The bits I saw on television looked quite bizarre and completely out of control. I think the BBC should have given their staff lessons on how to behave before she arrived.’

The Duke of Edinburgh was said to be ‘progressing satisfactorily’ yesterday as he continued to recover in hospital from exploratory abdominal surgery on Friday.

Prince’s Philip’s doctor, Professor John Cunningham, visited him for 30 minutes on his third day at the London Clinic. The Prince, who will be 92 tomorrow, is expected to recuperate at the clinic in Marylebone for two weeks.

The illness is not thought to involve his heart or bladder – which have caused him problems in the past.

Buckingham Palace said the surgery had been pre-arranged.

Not so long ago, the only things held aloft during Royal visits were flags, modestly flicked from side-to-side, often no higher than the neck.

In recent years taking snaps and videos on mobile phones has become commonplace, but normally during outdoor walkabouts rather than indoors.

As Princess Elizabeth, the Queen accompanied her father George VI to Broadcasting House in 1939.

And during last week’s visit she recalled in an address that she ‘came again with the Duke of Edinburgh shortly before the Coronation in 1953’.

Today’s BBC newsroom – with its casually attired staff and sea of smartphones – would have been a far cry from those days when decorum was paramount.

‘I think they should have shown far more respect,’ said etiquette expert Angela Marshall.

‘It must have been very disturbing for the Queen.

‘And, let’s face it, these people could have still have had photos. This was all taking place in the BBC, after all. The trouble is people want to get their own pictures on Twitter to show they were there.’She was right. No sooner had the Queen departed than staff were plastering their souvenir snaps across social media.

Asked about the criticism, a BBC spokesman said the visit ‘was a  significant day for the BBC and  staff were eager to join in the  celebration and give Her Majesty a warm welcome’.
