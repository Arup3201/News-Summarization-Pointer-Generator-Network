Chelsea have made an enquiry for Paris Saint-Germainâ€™s Ezequiel Lavezzi.

The French club have signed David Luiz and are keen on taking Eden Hazard, Oscar and Petr Cech from Stamford Bridge, too.

Yet in the throes of negotiations Chelsea are understood to have asked about a price for Argentine Lavezzi who is keen to play in a more competitive league.

Star man: Lavezzi scored against Chelsea when the sides met in the Champions League this season

Following? The French club are also interested in taking Eden Hazard (left) and Oscar (right) from Chelsea

Chelsea are
 looking for striking options after Samuel Eto'o was placed on the free 
transfer list, and are thought to be interested in Lavezzi to come in 
alongside Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa.

It is not only up front where Chelsea are looking to strengthen and they are monitoring centre halves.

Jose
 Mourinho also likes Manchester City target Eliaquim Mangala of Porto 
after being rebuffed in enquiries for Raphael Varane at Real Madrid.
