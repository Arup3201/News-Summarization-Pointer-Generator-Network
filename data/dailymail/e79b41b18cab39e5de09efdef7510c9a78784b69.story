Manchester City will refuse to sell Yaya Toure to another English club, but Paris Saint-Germain are favourites to land the midfielder if he manages to engineer a move away.

The 31-year-old's future at the Etihad Stadium is in doubt after a farcical episode on Tuesday where his agent, Dimitry Seluk, insisted he wanted out after being treated like a 'nobody'.

Toure went on to back up his representative's claims and may leave the Premier League champions this summer.

Ambition: Toure has been linked with a return 'home' to Barcelona after a lack of respect from City

Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week

Having a look: Laurent Blanc's PSG are favourites to sign Toure if he does leave the Etihad Stadium

The bizarre standoff derives from the Ivorian's birthday last week, where Seluk claims he wasn't handed a celebratory cake. Toure was in fact given two.

City have kept their counsel up until 
now and will block any attempt to lever a move but Toure himself has 
confirmed that he wants out.

Sportsmail understands that Manchester United and Chelsea - the only domestic clubs to have the financial clout to prise him away - would think twice before making an offer given Tuesday's soap opera, while City would block any move regardless.

But - if tensions do not dissipate - the club may have to cash in, particularly given the player's age.

The fact 
that Toure is coming towards his twilight years would not deter Laurent 
Blanc's PSG, who remain intent on breaking into Europe's elite 
imminently and will stop at nothing to do so - even after UEFA's recent 
Financial Fair Play sanctions.

Ligue
 1 rivals Monaco would join Real Madrid and Barcelona in the race to 
sign Toure, who said that he wants to end his career at the Nou Camp.  

'Yes, I have talked before about ending 
my career at Barcelona - but we don't know because football is moving 
fast and you never know about tomorrow.'

Could it be? Toure has indicated that he wants to end his career back at Barcelona, who sold him for £24m
