She was later admitted to Bellevue Hospital with a broken nose and punctured lung.

Initial reports suggest the Figueroa and Locón, a delivery boy for the restaurant on Second Avenue, may have been standing next to each other at the time of the explosion and may have been blown upward toward the restaurant's cellar - causing them to be buried in the rubble. 

Locón's family also rushed to the scene and scoured local hospitals after hearing news of the blast, CBS reports. 

His older brother, Alfredo, told CBS on Friday that he is devastated about Locón's disappearance.

Meanwhile, some debris from the explosion and fire is being taken to a secure site where it will be examined again for any human remains.

An official with knowledge of the operation told The Associated Press of the plans. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the operation is ongoing.

Emergency workers have been looking through the rubble for signs of the two men who have been missing since Thursday's blast. The explosion and subsequent fire leveled three buildings.

The official says upper layers of debris have already been removed and workers have reached the basement level. One of the buildings contained the restaurant where the missing men are believed to have been at the time, Sushi Park.

Workers are examining debris onsite before it is removed to the secure location.

Authorities and the men's families have been searching for the men tirelessly. Police have been using search dogs in the recovery efforts.

Robert Boyce, the department's chief of detectives, told the Times that police received initial reports of about 42 people who might be missing.

However, police concluded that only Locón and Figueroa were known to have been in the building during the explosion.

Four of the 22 people injured remain in critical condition. Eighteen of the 22 suffered non-life threatening injuries. 

Workers from Con Edison reportedly visited the building (121) for about 45 minutes, the Times reports. After the workers left, the owner of the sushi bar reported smelling gas to the building's owner. 

The explosion occurred 15 minutes later as workers went to look in the basement.

Access: During a press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there is a possibility that a gas line in the restaurant's basement was 'inappropriately accessed internally by people in the building

The investigation into the explosion's cause is ongoing, and the focus is on the plumbing and gas work being done at Sushi Park -- public records show no current work permit on file for plumbing work to be done at the location.  

During a press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there is a possibility that a gas line in the restaurant's basement was 'inappropriately accessed internally by people in the building,' NBC reports.

Authorities are investigating whether the explosion was the result of a gas theft scheme, according to NBC.

Though no one was charged with any wrongdoing at the time -- as it was being treated as a safety violation by inspectors -- investigators are trying to determine if a similar gas-theft scheme will take place.
