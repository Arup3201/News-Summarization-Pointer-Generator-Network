'It is Shane Warne... he represents the majority of Australians, I would have thought'. 

Today Show host Karl Stefanovic jumped to the defence of cricket legend Shane Warne on Monday morning following a backlash over Warne's controversial booze remarks last night.

Warne  was pilloried on social media for repeatedly asking cricket stars how 'thirsty' they were for a drink in interviews following Australia's demolition of New Zealand at the Cricket World Cup final. 

'What's wrong with having a drink to celebrate anything? What's wrong with that?' Stefanovic questioned during a lively panel discussion.

Mornings host David Campbell objected to Warne's comments. 

'I hate this,' he said. 'There is a stadium full of young men and women who look up to those guys. 

'And it would have been nice if one of those cricketers said: "Nothing is better than what we did on the field, Warnie.

'We can't sit around here, and we do it all the time on Mornings, you do it here on Today, and go 'we have a drinking problem' - and then sit here and and celebrate that. 

'I gave up booze a year ago because I had enough and I was ashamed of perpetuating that in front of my own son. 

'I want to give back and lead by a better example than that. I think it's shameful. 

'I mean OK, we all know Warney likes to party, he's a fun guy.'

Stefanovic argued that a celebratory drink was part of the country's 'culture' and 'history'. 

Warne fired back at his critics in a late-night tweet: 'Straya (Australia) is the best place in the world, not politically correct'. 

The furore began started Warne asked wicket-keeper first asked Brad Haddin: 'Are you feeling thirsty?'

He then quizzed batsman Steve Smith: 'Are you going to have a bit of a drink tonight too Smitty? Are you going to get thirsty as well?'

Finally, Warne asked fast bowler Josh Hazlewood: 'So what's the plan - besides lots of drink and that? 

'How long is that going to last? Just one night, two nights? 

'Go and enjoy yourselves guys. Hopefully we'll join you for a few.' 

Twitter erupted. Iohyouforever said: 'Shane Warne currently sounds thirstier than James Franco in 127 hours.'

Another user suggested Warne was trying to get an invite for a night out.

ABC journalist Lucy Carter said: 'I feel like Shane Warne is desperately trying to get invited to drinks but every player he's interviewing isn't having a bar of it.' 

Warne eventually got his wish - getting a photo of himself with Michael Clarke, a drink and the gold cup at 3am. 'Congrats buddy, so happy for you !!!! #thirsty Hahahah,' he wrote on Instragram
