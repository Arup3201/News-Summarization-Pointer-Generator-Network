Gary Neville has claimed winning the Premier League title is better than having children in the wake of Manchester City's triumph.

City secured their second title in three years after a comfortable 2-0 victory over West Ham thanks to goals from Samir Nasri and Vincent Kompany either side of half-time.

Speaking after the game, Neville, who won the title with Manchester United on eight occasions and has two children, said: 'Winning the Premier Legaue trophy is the best thing that can happen to you.

'People say it's having kids, but anyone can have kids, not everyone can win a Premier League title'.

City realistically only needed to avoid defeat to take the crown, but got the win and pipped Liverpool by two points to seal their second title in three years.

It meant Manuel Pellegrini could celebrate a league and Capital One Cup double in his first season in charge.

'He's a winner, he wants us to win,' goalkeeper Joe Hart said of his manager on Sky Sports. 'He is a measured man and he believes in what he does.'

City timed their run to perfection, winning their last five games as Liverpool stumbled with the finishing line in sight.

'We came strong at the end, we won the games we needed to,' Hart added. 'We are all winners, and strong personalities.'
