As he runs around the store, he aims a kick at the glass display cases to try and get at the valuable gadgets.

But, just seconds later, he flees, running out with nothing other than his empty bag.

The car used in the attempted ramraid was found the next morning, abandoned just yards from the store.

Owner Carl Brown, who runs the franchise with business partner Peter Hughes, said he had been forced to shut down for two days to repair the damage.

The 25-year-old from Worcester said: 'It’s devastating for us. The store only opened three months ago.

'We are a new business and as well of the cost of repairs we will lose trade while the shop is closed.

'Hopefully we can get everything sorted out as quickly as possible and get up and running.

'It was a shock seeing it happen on the CCTV footage. We’re just glad they didn’t get away with any of the stock.'

Gina Lycett, spokesperson for West Midlands Police, said: 'Two men are believed to have entered the store but escaped empty handed.

'They attempted to drive away but abandoned the vehicle a short distance from the story.

'The vehicle has been recovered by police and will be forensically examined.'
