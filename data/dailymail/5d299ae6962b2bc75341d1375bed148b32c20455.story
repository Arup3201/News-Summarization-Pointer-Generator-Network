A 21-year-old French woman had to be rescued by passers-by after she went skinny dipping during the opening weekend of Oktoberfest in Munich.

The tourist waded into the Isar river on a dare from her American friend but quickly ran into trouble when she was caught by the strong current.

She was treated for hypothermia after she was rescued by a local man who jumped into the river to grab her and two teenagers who held onto the pair from the riverbank, The Local reported.
