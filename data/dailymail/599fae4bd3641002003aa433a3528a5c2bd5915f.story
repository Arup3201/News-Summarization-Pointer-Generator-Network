Alex Corbisiero knows he must usurp a world-class rival if he is to mark his latest injury comeback with a recall to England’s starting XV for the Six Nations.

Northampton’s 26-year-old prop has returned early from shoulder surgery and will play against Newcastle at Franklin’s Gardens on Friday as the next step towards challenging Joe Marler for the national No 1 shirt. 

Corbisiero has endured a prolonged spell of medical misfortune, which has limited him to just four Test caps in the last two years — two of them for the triumphant Lions in Australia.

However, his spirit has not been broken by the setbacks which have disrupted his stellar career. ‘It’s very hard, but I focus on the controllables,’ he said. ‘I do everything I can to be in the best shape, to recover and be proactive about preventing injuries. 

'I’ve had some bad luck, but it’s not going to dampen my heart. I’m looking to play each week, play my heart out, and — hope to God — avoid injury.’

In light of the latest injury, he added: ‘As I’ve got older and had to deal with some hard times, your mental toughness and maturity steps in. I focused on planning my rehab, planning my return and everything I needed to make sure I got back as quickly as possible.

‘That’s the mindset I had from day one: that there was no time to sit and pity myself. I have come back in the minimum time the surgeons would allow.’

Once he is back into his stride with champions Northampton, Corbisiero will set his sights on England, but Harlequins captain Marler will be difficult to shift from the front row. 

‘Joe has been outstanding. He is one of the top performers in the world in his position,’ said Corbisiero. ‘With Joe playing so well, if I want to get back in I have to play better.’

Having missed the last two Six Nations through injury, his desire to be involved is a strong driving force. ‘It is more than frustrating to sit out and watch back-to-back Six Nations,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, if I do get myself healthy and put my hand up to be in that environment, I will make the most of it.’

Corbisiero starred for the Lions in their series victory over Australia in 2013 and scored a try in the third Test
