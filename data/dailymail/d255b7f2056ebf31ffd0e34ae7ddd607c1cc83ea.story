Melissa Reid’s father last night told The Mail on Sunday that he’s not totally convinced by their version of events – and he wants his daughter to come clean and plead guilty.

William Reid thinks Melissa should change her plea in order to reduce her sentence.

Up until now Melissa and Michaella McCollum Connolly have insisted they are innocent and were forced to unknowingly carry drugs. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Melissa Reid's father, William Reid told The Mail on Sunday that he's not totally convinced by the Peru Two's version of events and he wants his daughter to come clean and plead guilty

Mr Reid was reunited with his daughter Melissa at Dirandro police station in Lima last week

However, if they plead guilty, they may get off with only six years and eight months.

On Thursday the girls were moved to the Virgen de Fatima jail, which is surrounded by shanty towns just south of Lima.

The only Western inmates, they will endure a military-style regime alongside 1,000 other female prisoners, including murderers and terrorists.

Last night, in an exclusive interview Mr Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, who visited the girls in prison on Friday, told The Mail on Sunday he’s ‘still not 100 per cent about their story’.

When Melissa saw him she broke down in tears and told him: ‘Dad, I love you,  I missed you.’

Mr Reid, 53, said: ‘You continually think you’ll wake up and this nightmare will end. They should plead guilty. They should work with the authorities, tell them everything  they know.

‘We would then be working towards an end game. At the moment it’s left open-ended.

‘God forbid, if it goes to trial, you have the prospect of receiving that 15-year sentence.

‘It’s indefensible to say that they didn’t have drugs or know they had drugs. They did carry the drugs.

'They were found to have drugs on them. They collected packages which transpired to be drugs. They are going to be guilty of that.

‘If that’s the Peruvian law, regardless of the mitigating circumstances, then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you’re trying to appeal and reduce.

‘These girls are young. They may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they’re going to go free. If you’re adamant that you’re innocent, you don’t believe that you’re even going to be given a sentence.’

Mr Reid, who works for the National Grid, was able to take the girls an extra mattress, a blanket and a KFC meal, which they were ‘delighted’ about.

‘They seemed anxious and full of nervous tension. Melissa is clearly starting to think and understand that pleading guilty may well be the best option,’ he said. ‘They’re still young girls, far away from home.

‘The most poignant moment, for me, was when I explained to her that it will be the trial before I see her again.

'That was the biggest reality check that I’ve seen from her. She cried. I told her that the cost involved was significant and she understood. It will be hard.’

Fighting back tears, Mr Reid added: ‘As I sit here tonight, I’m still not 100 per cent about their story.

'But two girls, who prior to Ibiza did not know each other, are telling a very similar story. They have been pretty consistent all along. Only those two girls know the truth.’

The girls may have to wait up to three years for a trial if they maintain their not guilty plea. Mr Reid said he did not want Melissa to miss ‘the best times of her life’.

He added: ‘It’s worse than a death .  .  . we could have dealt with a death because we could grieve. This is enduring.’
