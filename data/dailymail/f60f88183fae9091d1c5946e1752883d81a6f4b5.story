Barcelona forward Neymar has revealed his fun side by singing a rap song aimed at his Brazilian friend MC Nego do Borel.

The 22-year-old, singing topless, picks up the microphone before trying his best to rap.

It is clear to see Neymar wasn't practicing his rap skills when he was out injured with a back problem during Barcelona's pre-season schedule.

Neymar was forced into sitting out Barcelona's first La Liga match of the season due to the injury he picked up in Brazil's World Cup game against Colombia.

Barcelona won Luis Enrique's first league match in control of the Nou Camp outfit thanks to a brace from Lionel Messi and a goal by promising starlet Munir El Haddadi.

Neymar's awaited injury comeback has been postponed following an ankle knock he picked up in training.
