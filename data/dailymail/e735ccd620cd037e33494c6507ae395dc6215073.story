After several seasons of demure ankle boots — from Chelsea to biker styles — the fashion crowd has set its sights a little higher.

Knee-high boots were all over the autumn/winter catwalks in a striking variety of shades and shapes, and are now hitting the High Street from a bargain £30 to up to £300 for a high-end pair that will last years.

From glitzy evening boots to sturdy suede numbers, it’s a classic shape that is practical while still looking sexy.

But this is also a style older women often struggle with, for fear of looking more mutton than lamb in the unforgiving shape, which can highlight cankles, wide calves or short legs.

Here, 54-year-old Eve Ahmed shows off the boots that work for any woman . . .

FEISTY FLATS

Flat shoes can make legs look short and stumpy, as they don’t give the same lift as heels — but wearing stilettos all day simply isn’t practical.

Boots are a brilliant compromise, as a pair that hit just above the knee will make legs look longer. This pair are great, as they have adjustable buckles, so they can easily be altered to make them the perfect size.

 CALF SLIMMERS

Knee muffin-top is not a good look, but the answer lies with brands that offer different widths, such as these from Duo.

EVENING GLAMOUR 

Instead of classic, black stiletto shoes for a night out, why not try stiletto boots? They’re just as glamorous, but a little bit funky, too.

LEG LENGTHENERS

Knee-high boots can highlight shorter legs, but this elongating, snake-print pair stop just above the knee. Pricey, but you’ll be wearing them for the next ten years.

OFFICE CHIC

These grey, suede boots are perfect for days when it’s too chilly or wet for heels. And they’re office-appropriate, thanks to a subtle colour and high heel.

CANKLE CONCEALER 

It can be difficult finding a boot that fits comfortably over swollen cankles — a middle-age affliction that occurs when the calf is the same thickness as the ankle.

The sparkles at the top of these bargain boots draw the eye upwards and away from the problem area, and these are slouchy around the ankle while still looking slim-cut.
