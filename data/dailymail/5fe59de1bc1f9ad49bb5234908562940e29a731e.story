A couple used filthy machinery caked in blood to produce around 27,000 meals at a sausage factory.

Owners of B&L Sausages Brian Wainwright, 45, and his 38-year-old
 wife Lorraine, produced the food in a filthy barn which was covered in rat poison, manure and animal carcases.

These images show the disgusting conditions discovered by Environmental Health inspectors when they raided the premises in Mixenden, West Yorkshire, last May.

Revolting: These disgusting images show the filthy machinery which was used to make 27,000 meals in a sausage factory. Tools, including the mincer (pictured) were full of dirt and caked in blood

Guilty: Brian Wainwright, 45, who ran B&L Sausages was sentenced to eight months in prison for each offence, suspended for two years at Bradford Crown Court

Packages described the food as being 'Passionately sourced', but officials said the conditions were a 'high risk to public health'.

Particles from an unsealed barn wall had fallen into the mincer and tools, including a meat cleaver and whisk, were found to be rusty and caked in filth.

Officers even discovered dead cows and chickens on the floor while the farm’s dog ran off with a lamb’s head during the raid.

Prosecutor Howard Shaw told Bradford Crown Court how the sausages, produced during the time spent at the barn between April and May 2012, accounted for approximately 27,000 meals.

One cafe owner, not named in court, said the sausages 'had a strange taste and would stick to teeth when you bit into them'.

Conditions: Environmental Health inspectors discovered raw meet hanging from the ceiling and a dead chicken in a bin

Mr Shaw added that there was no evidence of any food poisoning as a consequence of the breaches.

Judge Colin Burn said: 'It is hard to imagine a more lethal environment for providing food for public consumption.

'It was undoubtedly a serious public health risk waiting to happen - it’s a miracle that no one was seriously affected.'

Brian Wainwright, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, entered guilty pleas to a total of 14 allegations including one which related to his failure to put in place adequate procedures to control pests and prevent domestic animals from having access to places where food was prepared.

Squalid: Health officials found bags strewn all over the floor as rat traps were discovered above work surfaces

Filth: Particles from an unsealed barn wall had fallen into the mincer and tools were found to be rusty

He also pleaded guilty to operating the food business without the approval of Calderdale Council at the barn and at a different site.

Other offences included holding unsafe food for the purpose of sale, failing to ensure that food premises were kept clean and well maintained, failing to store raw materials and ingredients in appropriate conditions and failing to properly dispose of food waste.

He also pleaded guilty to an offence of misleading consumers by selling pork and leek sausages which only had a meat content of 47 per cent when the packaging indicated they should have contained a minimum of 60 per cent meat.

Wainwright’s wife pleaded guilty to two offences relating to her failure to provide information about suppliers of food to the company and businesses which had been supplied with products by B&L Sausages.

Damning: Offences included holding unsafe food for the purpose of sale, failing to ensure that food premises were kept clean and well maintained, failing to store raw materials

Wainwright was sentenced to eight months in prison for each offence, suspended for two years and was ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service.

He is also prohibited from managing a food production business. His wife received a fine of £750.

Speaking after the case Calderdale Council’s Cabinet member for Economy and Environment, Barry Collins, said: 'People should be able to have faith that food businesses are following hygiene rules, and that the products they buy are safe to eat. When health is put at risk we won’t hesitate to take action.'
