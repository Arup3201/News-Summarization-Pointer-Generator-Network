It is not just Scotland on the verge of breaking away from the UK - a small pocket of South Yorkshire could go with it.

The town of Doncaster could be left if limbo if the Scots vote for independence, due a historical quirk which means it is officially part of Scotland.

The Yorkshire town was taken by the Scots in the 12th century when King David I seized vast swathes of northern England and it was signed over by King Stephen of England in the first Treaty of Durham.

English monarch Henry II and his forces regained control of the area 21 years later, but historians say Doncaster - dubbed 'Bonny Donny' by some Scots - was never formally given back.

Historians say the South Yorkshire town of Doncaster is technically part of Scotland due to an historic quirk

The matter has always been treated as an historical anomaly by locals, but it could become relevant if Scotland decides to split the union today. 

Describing the background to the claim, Local historian Dr Charles Kelham said: 'David had invaded England in support of his niece, the Empress Matilda, the widow of a Roman Emperor whose claim to the throne of England seemed to have rather more justification than [then-King] Stephen's.

'Stephen bought David off at the meeting in Durham by offering him a selection of additional estates, one of which was the manor and soke of Doncaster. It was a sweetener, effectively.' 

Prince Henry of Scotland is credited with shaping the history of the town and formally establishing Doncaster as a borough, but the prince predeceased his father in 1152, and David himself died the year after.

While records indicate the area had reverted to the English crown by 1156, there is no documentary evidence of a formal return of the land.

Dr Kelham added: 'The arrangement did not last long, but it is right it appears that there was never any official giving back.'

The issue is of interest to Labour leader and Doncaster North Ed Miliband, who could become a so-called 'ghost MP' representing a 'Scottish seat' if a Yes vote is returned, it has jokingly been suggested.

He said: 'It's an interesting quirk of history. Doncaster is a great place and Scotland is a great country, as part of the same nation the two have a great deal to offer each other.'

Doncaster's mayor Ros Jones added: 'Doncaster has strong historic links with Scotland, including the Scottish miners who came to work in the borough.

'Like many other local authorities, the council flew the Scottish flag at the weekend in solidarity for the Union. I think we are better together.'

1135 - Henry I of England dies and is succeeded by his nephew, Stephen of England (pictured, right). This angers Scotland which supported Henry's daughter Matilda. In December that year, Scottish King David I invades northern England

1136 - Stephen and David sign peace treaty in Durham with gives David parts of Cumberland, Lancashire and Doncaster.

1139 - River Tees declared Scottish border after continued fighting.

1153 - King David of Scotland dies in Carlisle. He is succeeded by his grandson Malcolm IV (Malcolm the Maiden), who inherits Northumberland.

1154 - Henry II takes English throne from Stephen and, despite early promises to let David keep his territories in the north, he reclaims northern England, allowing Scotland to keep only Tynedale.

Scots go to the polls today in a referendum that will decide the fate of the UK for years to come
