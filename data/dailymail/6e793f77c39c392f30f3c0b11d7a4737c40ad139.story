After a year and a half behind barbed wire as a prisoner in World War II, 2nd Lt. David C. Cox had just about reached his breaking point.

Deliveries of Red Cross parcels to Stalag VII-A had all but ceased, and the U.S. Army bomber co-pilot and his fellow POWs were subsisting on scant rations of bug-infested soup and bread. Outside the wire, Adolf Hitler's forces showed no signs of giving up.

Cold and hungry, the North Carolina-born soldier made a difficult decision. He slipped the gold aviator's ring - a gift from his parents engraved with his name - off his finger and passed it through a fence to an Italian POW, who handed back a couple of chocolate bars.

Desperation: 2nd Lt David C. Cox, seen centre with fellow soldiers, traded his precious ring for two chocolate bars while being held at a POW camp

The pilot would never see his treasured ring again - but almost 70 years later it has found its way back to his family.

The gold ring had ended up in the hands of a Russian soldier on his way home from the war, who is thought to have traded it for a night's room and board at a small pub in present day Serbia - owned by the grandparents of Martin Kiss, 64.

Mr Kiss' grandmother gave him the ring when he moved to Germany in 1971, for luck, or in case he needed some quick cash.

He said he knew the ring must have come from an American soldier, but had no idea how to trace the owner.

The master church painter and artist wore the ring on his little finger, before eventually placing it in a corked glass bottle for fear it would get damaged as he worked.

That is until American couple Mark and Mindy Turner moved into the house next door in the tiny Bavarian village of Hohenberg.

After inviting the Turners for dinner, Mr Kiss enlisted the help of the computer-savvy pair to try and trace the origins of the gold ring.

Mark Turner went online when he got back home, and within 20 minutes he found a 2005 master's thesis from North Carolina State University.

One 
focus of Norwood McDowell's 219-page paper was the war diary of his 
wife's grandfather, David C. Cox Sr. - the name on the ring's 
inscription.

And there, on page 179, was the anecdote about the 
chocolate bars. After all those years, this epic ring cycle had ended 
within a two-hour drive of where it began.'It just seemed like it couldn't be true,' Mr Turner said.He e-mailed McDowell a photograph of the ring and its inscription, who contacted the bomber pilot's 67-year-old son, also called David Cox.

'That's it for sure,' an ecstatic Mr Cox replied when McDowell forwarded the picture.'Well, praise the Lord!' Mindy Turner wrote back. 'We are so excited for your family!'After a few more e-mails and phone calls, the ring was on its way to the United States.

Last
week, about a dozen family members and friends gathered in the living 
room of David C. Cox Jr.'s Raleigh home and watched as he slit open a 
small yellow parcel from Germany.

'And
here it is,' he said with a long sigh as he pulled out the ring. 'Oh, 
my goodness. ... I never thought it would ever happen. I thought it was 
gone. We all thought it was gone.

'He thought it was gone,' he said of his late father.

Team effort: Martin and Regina Kiss are seen with their neighbours, U.S. couple Mark and Mindy Turner, who helped Mr Kiss to trace the ring's original owner

Following the December 1941 Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor, the elder Cox left college and enlisted. The 
Army Air Corps accepted him on his second application.He graduated from flight school on July 26, 1942. That same day, he married his high school sweetheart, Hilda Walker.

To celebrate his commission, Irvin and Connie Bell Cox presented their middle son with a gold signet ring, the oval emblazoned with a raised propeller and wings. Engraved inside were the words, 'Mother & Father to David C. Cox Greensboro, NC,' and the numbers 10-4-18-42 — his birthday and the current year.Cox was assigned to the 305th Bomb Group, 364th Squadron — part of the 'Mighty Eighth' Air Force. By October, he was in England.

As a co-pilot in the B-17 'Flying Fortress', Cox flew more than a dozen bombing missions over occupied France and the German heartland. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for helping to get his burning plane back to England from a May 1943 raid that cost the lives of half his 10-man crew.On July 28, 1943, Cox's plane was shot down over Kassel, Germany. He parachuted into a rose garden, was taken prisoner, interrogated and then shipped to Stalag Luft III, the POW camp made famous in the Steve McQueen film The Great Escape.He remained there until January 1945, when he and the other Allied officers were force-marched three days through the snow, then packed into train cars for another three days before ending up at Stalag VII-A near Moosburg, northeast of Munich.As Hitler's Third Reich collapsed upon itself, POWs from all over found their way to Moosburg. By the time Cox arrived, conditions there went from bad to what one historian described as 'barely correct by the standards of the Geneva Convention'.It was at Moosburg that he traded the ring for the candy bars.Finally, on April 28, 1945, Gen. George Patton's 14th Armored Division liberated the camp, and Cox, who was promoted to 1st lieutenant, made his way back to North Carolina. He started a tire retreading equipment company with his brother, and he and Hilda raised three children.Cox didn't talk much about the war, except to remind his children of his privations when they refused to clean their plates. And he spoke wistfully about his lost ring.Upon his return from the war, one of the first things Cox did was to have an exact duplicate made of his prized ring — right down to the inscription. When he died in 1994, the replica passed to his son, David Jr., who wore it until it finally broke in the middle.

Cradling the original in his hand after opening the package Friday, the pilot's son was struck by the ring's condition, compared to its replacement. His sister, Joy Wagner, walked over and took the ring in her hands.

'Gosh, it's beautiful,' she said as tears welled in her eyes. 'Oh, that's so special.'David Cox said holding the ring gave him goose bumps.'I feel his presence,' he said of his father. 'I wish he was here.'Kiss — whose own grandfather spent several years in a Soviet camp during and after the war — said in a phone interview with The Associated Press that his only regret is that David Cox Sr. and his grandmother weren't alive to share the 'happy ending'.Refusing to accept even reimbursement for the shipping, he added, 'You know the old saying: It's better to give than to receive.'
