Perhaps the only surprising thing is that it’s taken this long for the usual suspects to come out and start bashing the artistic triumph of the year.

But then, it really must stick in the craw of our metropolitan cultural elite that after all those years of championing so much talentless twaddle — pickled sharks, unmade beds, etc — along comes a work of art which really does capture the public imagination. It’s a dazzling exercise in originality and creativity which has already attracted four million visitors. And, horror of horrors, it’s about war.

Not only that, it has been produced by an artist who has never even made it to the shortlist of that exalted yardstick of contemporary art, the Turner Prize. Worse still, Paul Cummins’s ceramic poppies, now filling the moat of the Tower of London as a memorial to every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War, have been installed in a royal fortress. And the public — those ungrateful, ill-educated fools — have been queueing up in their thousands every day just to catch a glimpse.

The poppy display at the Tower of London has attracted thousands of visitors - but one critic has trashed the stunning work as 'fake'

The poppies are now filling the moat of the Tower as a memorial to every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War

But former Turner Prize judge Jonathan Jones, art critic of the Guardian, said the work was an 'inward-looking, Ukip-type memorial'

He wrote: ‘The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something'

Now, a former Turner Prize judge can stand it no longer. Jonathan Jones, art critic of the Guardian, has trashed the work as a ‘fake, inward-looking, Ukip-type memorial’ which demeans us all.

‘It is deeply disturbing that a hundred years on from 1914, we can only mark this terrible war as a national tragedy,’ he writes on the Guardian website. ‘What does it say about Britain in 2014 that we still narrowly remember our own dead and do not mourn the German or French or Russian victims? It’s the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive.’

He goes on to attack the ‘fake nobility’ of this ‘deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial’. Dismissing the entire thing as ‘a lie’, he suggests a replacement: ‘The moat of the Tower should be filled with barbed wire and bones. That would mean something.’

Many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project, any more than someone might quibble with the Cenotaph. Some chapters in the history of this country are of such a different order and magnitude that they transcend the petty squabbles of Left and Right. The death of close to a million men and women in the Great War is one of them.

So too, for that matter, were this year’s commemorations of the 70th anniversary of D-Day. We mark these moments not to enshrine some political doctrine, and certainly not to celebrate victory, but simply to express our thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. In doing so, we honour the eternal pledge: ‘We will remember them.’ 

Yet there will always be that bien pensant strand among our chattering classes who simply ‘know better’ and cannot allow such moments to pass without imposing their oh-so-enlightened contemporary take on it all.

As it happens, after reading Mr Jones’s words, I remembered that he also dismissed the new Bomber Command Memorial (backed by generous Daily Mail readers) as ‘crass’ and ‘a nasty piece of artistic jingoism’. Not that the bomber boys had cause to worry. That has also turned out to be a phenomenally popular addition to the London landscape.

But then, this is the same critic who, earlier this month, likened Tracey Emin (of unmade bed fame) to Michelangelo. 

With thousands flocking to the site each day to see the emerging 888,246 poppies, many will be astonished that anyone could politicise this magnificent project

The work, created by Paul Cummins, is to simply express thanks to those who made the ultimate sacrifice - without political agenda

The exhibition (left), called Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, has attracted massive crowds (right), particularly during half-term

The sea of crimson poppies can be seen from The View From The Shard - a beacon of colour in the more grey London surroundings 

George Orwell’s famous dictum — ‘it is unquestionably true that almost any English intellectual would feel more ashamed of standing to attention during “God save the King” than of stealing from a poor box’ — remains as true today as it was when he wrote it during the Second World War.

Why is it that the Left have such a loathing for home-grown patriotism while they are so keen to salute it elsewhere? Why is it still thought to be cool (after all these years) to have that clapped-out hero of the Cuban revolution, Che Guevara, on your wall or your T-shirt, while decrying ‘Thatcher the warmonger’ for liberating the Falklands?

Even among the centre Left, there is sometimes a sense that all this commemoration stuff is a bit phoney. Tony Blair saw nothing wrong with merging the 60th anniversaries of VE Day and VJ Day in 2005 into a single, non-specific event to save time and money. The veterans were appalled, yet the Prime Minister of the day could not understand why.  

Back in the Seventies, the Left were urging us all to ‘move on’ and downgrade Armistice Day. In 1982, after the Falklands War, the BBC decided to switch conductors after musical director Mark Elder had called for the abolition of ‘jingoistic’ flag-waving at the Last Night of the Proms. Even today, there are strident voices insisting that the school curriculum should no longer teach 1918 as a ‘victory’.

And nothing gets this Leftie lot going quite like a poppy.

Whether it’s the right-on crowd who insist on wearing white poppies (to honour pacifism) in the run-up to Remembrance Sunday or those, like Channel 4’s Jon Snow, who refuse to wear one at all (on grounds of ‘poppy fascism’), there will always be some people who want to be different.

No one should dispute their right to do so. Such freedoms of expression are why those wars were fought in the first place. Even the protester who burnt poppies in front of Royal British Legion fundraisers outside the Royal Albert Hall on Armistice Day 2010 — shouting ‘Burn in hell, British soldiers’ — was only fined £50 for threatening behaviour (he’d have been fined more if he’d parked on a double yellow line while doing so).

But that doesn’t mean we should let patronising side-swipes pass unchallenged. 

The Queen was so impressed with the ceramic installation that she and the Duke of Edinburgh had a private tour 

Her Majesty looked contemplative as she toured the poppies earlier this month. The poppies will be sold to raise money for charity 

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the memorial alongside Prince Harry, walking through the now-colourful dry moat 

So what if the sea of poppies at the Tower is a British commemoration? Every nation honours the dead in its own way. Think of the profoundly moving tradition which takes place every night of every year in Belgium.

Except for the duration of the Second World War, the buglers of the Ypres Fire Brigade have appeared each evening at the town’s Menin Gate. There, the traffic stops and the people of this proud town salute all the British who fell in Flanders. To date, I have never heard anyone condemn them as a bunch of Ukip-supporting simpletons. Maybe it’s only a matter of time.

The Tower of London project was dreamt up by ceramicist Paul Cummins only a year ago, as he pondered a fitting tribute for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War. His idea was to plant a ceramic poppy for every British and colonial serviceman who died in the Great War, then sell them to raise funds for charities linked to the Armed Forces. The trustees of Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower of London, quickly embraced the idea.

More than that, the Tower authorities have created a ritual whereby, every night, the names of dead soldiers are recited from a lectern overlooking the poppies. Anyone can nominate a loved one. 

In stirring scenes, Joey, the star of War Horse, also visited the poppies - one of several high profile visitors to the installation

Visitors have been taking photos in their thousands to document the snippet of history now laid out in central London 

The project has attracted enormous international attention, despite Mr Jones's assertions that it is nationalistic

Mr Jones also attacked the ‘fake nobility’ of this ‘deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial’, calling it 'a lie'

The whole project is an idea which so impressed the Queen that she asked for a guided tour. And despite Jonathan Jones’s assertion that it is a nationalistic, Brits-only affair, it has attracted enormous international attention.

The man from the Guardian had not even planned to see it. ‘I accidentally got swept into a tide of humanity at the weekend, or to put it another way, couldn’t move for crowds,’ he wrote. ‘What was going on? Why were so many people choking the streets of the City of London, where shops are closed on Saturdays?’ How frightful for the poor chap.

Well, I just so happened to be down there myself during this same weekend. I saw the poppies back in the summer and wanted to bring my children before the whole thing disappears in a fortnight. And I could think of no better way to impress upon them the enormity of the Great War than to show them this crimson moat and explain that every single one of the 888,246 poppies equals a real person who lived and died for this country.

It is an image which will be imprinted on countless young minds for many years to come. Yet after Armistice Day on November 11, the poppies will be uprooted, cleaned and dispatched to the people who have paid £25 for each one. Within weeks, this extraordinary display will be gone, unlike Damien Hirst’s pickled shark and Tracey Emin’s unmade bed, which will for better or worse live on to delight future generations.

Which, though, will most people remember 100 years from now?
