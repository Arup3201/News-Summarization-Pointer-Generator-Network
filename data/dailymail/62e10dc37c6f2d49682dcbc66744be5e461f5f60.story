A woman who was desperate to find love has today warned of the dangers of internet dating after her lover slashed her beloved horse before plotting an attack on her.

Nathalie Kelderman, 37, met Sebastiano Mauro, 43, on a dating site, but their passionate but ‘tempestuous’ affair ended when he flew into a rage after she said hello to another man.

Mauro took revenge by creeping into the stables where Miss Kelderman kept her horse and cutting the animal’s hind leg to the bone.

The Sicilian was arrested, but released on the condition he did not approach his ex.

of their relationship

Days later, police found him parked outside her home with a carving knife, two screwdrivers, scalpel blades, a tourniquet, latex gloves and two syringes containing his own blood.

Mauro, a surgical nurse at a private hospital, was jailed for five years in April after a jury found him guilty of injuring a horse and going equipped for burglary intending to inflict grievous bodily harm.

Miss Kelderman is now warning others about being sucked into dangerous relationships in the same way.

'Dating sites are great at telling you how they can help you find a lasting relationship or even marriage – but they don’t highlight the dangers,' she told the Mirror, adding: 'I was sucked into an abusive relationship because of internet dating.'

Miss Kelderman signed up to Match.com after she broke up with her partner of eight years because she was struggling to meet new people in and around her home in St Albans, Hertfordshire.

Mauro first contacted Miss Kelderman in December 2010, and days later, the pair met for lunch, sparking an 'instant connection'.

Soon the couple were seeing each other every week, and Mauro spoiled his new girlfriend with gifts paid for by his earnings as the second medical officer of a cruise liner.

But Miss Kelderman said Mauro became increasingly possessive, forcing her to restrict her time spent horse-riding or with friends.

The turning point came in July last year when he lashed out at her for saying hello to a jogger.

During a hearing at St Albans Court, the office worker said: ‘Sebastiano got upset. He said, “How dare you greet another man like that? How dare you humiliate me like that in public?”

‘He grabbed me by my arm, threw me on the floor and pinned me down, shaking me and shouting at me. Then he got up, kicked me and said, “You would make an excellent f****** w****”.’

On July 11, Mauro drove to the stables in Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, where Miss Kelderman kept her horse, a ten-year-old bay called Jessie.

A groom later found the horse bleeding heavily and a vet was called to stitch the wound.

Mauro was arrested, but days after a crown court judge freed him, police spotted him parked near Miss Kelderman’s home, covered in blood with a bag containing a knife.

He claimed he got blood on his clothes while taking samples for his job. He also said he was picking up personal items from Miss Kelderman. 

After realising he had reactivated his profile in September last year, Miss Kelderman twice warned Match.com about Mauro.

But his profile had not been removed from the website a month after his trial in March this year.  

It was finally taken off the site in May after a reporter contacted the organisation.

Miss Kelderman said: 'Men like Seb can use these sites to pick and choose from a list of potential future victims – it’s high time dating agencies met their responsibilities head on.'

A spokesman for Match said: 'The safety of our members is important to us, and in light of his conviction, we can confirm Mr Mauro’s profile has been removed.”
