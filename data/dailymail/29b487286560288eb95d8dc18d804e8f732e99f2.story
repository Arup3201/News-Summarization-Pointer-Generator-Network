Review: A panel said today that the the suicide of Frances Andrade days after she gave evidence against her abuser 'could and should' have been stopped

The suicide of a violinist days after she testified against her 'predatory' former choirmaster 'could and should' have been prevented, an investigation into her death has found.

Frances Andrade, 48, was left 'utterly traumatised' after giving evidence against Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, and killed herself before they were convicted of a string of indecent assaults.

Brewer, who was later stripped of his OBE, used his position to abuse Ms Andrade when she was 14 and 15 while at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester.

Giving evidence Mrs Andrade told the jury: ‘This feels like rape all over again’ and complained her abuser had 'smirked' at her across the room as she exposed him as a paedophile.

A week later the virtuoso musician then killed herself at home in Guildford, Surrey,

A serious case review said today Ms Andrade was 'let down' by mental health services who failed to realise how vulnerable she was as she fought to bring Brewer to justice.

The Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board's report said: 'The panel considered that this was a suicide that could and should have been prevented.

'Mrs A had reasons to live and deserved support as a troubled teenager, and she most certainly deserved support again when, as a mature woman concerned for the safety of others, she stood up and faced her abusers in court.

'The panel commend her bravery for taking a stand in this way. Those services, who held responsibility for her care, were found wanting.

'Perhaps then, Mrs A's wish to protect other young people can belatedly become a reality.'

Abusers: Michael Brewer was jailed for six years last year and is ex-wife Kay was also jailed for indecent assault on Frances Andrade

The trial heard the abuse took place in Brewer's office and in his camper van, which he used to drive Ms Andrade out of the school grounds and force her to perform sex acts.

At the age of 18, his wife joined in the abuse, telling Frances that she ‘owed her’ as she indecently assaulted her.

But he was cleared of raping her when she was 18 at his then home in Chorlton, Manchester.

Sentencing him, Judge Martin Rudland labelled Brewer 'a predatory sex offender' and his trial heard sexual activity between teachers and pupils at Chetham's was not uncommon.

Today's serious case review said that music schools, along with other 'hothousing establishments', including ballet schools and drama courses, create a 'backdrop' of 'very particular and potent form of grooming'. The report's panel said staff acted at times 'with impunity'.

The abuse Ms Andrade suffered only surfaced decades later when she confided to a friend at a dinner party in 2011.

She contacted Surrey Police and it led to an investigation by Greater Manchester Police. The report said that the division of labour between the two forces created 'gaps' and boundaries, across which information did not pass.

During the trial was at risk of causing herself harm and her state of mind after giving evidence was 'down and fragile', the report said.

She was given medication and treatment by her home treatment team (HTT) in Surrey.

The report added: 'It seemed as if Mrs A had stayed strong at her own emotional expense in order to maximise the chances of a conviction, but once she got home she declared herself 'utterly traumatised'.

'The HTT did not specifically assess Mrs A's suicide risk during this time nor how to mitigate it,' the report said.

Behind her facade, Ms Andrade hid 'turmoil and fragility' and the HTT 'lost sight' of how the court case outcome would influence whether she would overdose again.

A Mental Health Act assessment was not conducted and despite explicit statements to end her life, she was not considered to have passed the threshold for voluntary or compulsory in-patient treatment, the report went on.

She then killed herself last 14 months ago.

Adam Pemberton, assistant chief executive at Victim Support, said today: 'Victims of sexual abuse should not feel forced to choose between their well-being and justice.

'It is tragic that Frances Andrade felt she had to hide her mental health problems from a jury and subjected herself to cross-examination without the special measures that could have made the experience less distressing.

'We believe there is an urgent need for an inquiry into how the criminal justice system treats victims of crime who have mental health issues, matching recent efforts to help offenders who have mental health issues.'

Detective Chief Superintendent Vanessa
 Jardine, head of Greater Manchester Police's public protection 
division, said: 'On behalf of the force, I would like to extend once 
more our sympathies to the family of Frances Andrade.

'Her
 incredible bravery in facing her abusers in court and supporting a 
prosecution led to the conviction of Michael and Hilary Brewer and it is
 tragic that she was not able to see justice served'.

Surrey
 Police said they accepted that 'more must be done' to recognise the 
needs of vulnerable people in historic child abuse cases.

Alan Wardle, head of
 public affairs for the NSPCC, said: 'Despite being an adult when she 
gave evidence, Frances Andrade was still clearly a very vulnerable 
witness.

'There is an urgent
 need to reform how vulnerable people are treated in court. Many victims
 speak of the cross-examination being almost as bad as the original 
abuse'

A Government spokesman said: 'This tragic case highlights how vital it is that victims have the best support possible to help them recover and seek justice, from the moment they report a crime until the end of a trial and beyond'.

Victims' Commissioner Baroness Newlove, whose husband Garry was killed by a gang vandalising his car, said: 'Mental health should never be a barrier to justice.

'The tragic death of Frances has shown how crucial it is for all involved to truly understand and work together to protect vulnerable victims as soon as they enter the criminal justice system.

'There are no words to describe how traumatic it is to re-live a harrowing crime by giving evidence in court . My three daughters had to go through it when their father was brutally murdered and they still live with it each day.

'Victims tell me things need to change. The Victims' Code and pre-trial cross-examination are a welcome step but I want to see proper accountability in place to prevent further lives being lost in the future.'
