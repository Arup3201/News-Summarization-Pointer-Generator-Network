For expectant parents, it is the ultimate keepsake - a moving 3D hologram of their baby appearing to smile while still inside the womb.

Japanese parent-to-be could soon be offered the prints by Pioneer, which has developed a revolutionary hologram printing technique than can turn 3D ultrasound scans into the wallet sized keepsakes.

Each print take two hours to make, and is delivered is a presentation box with the baby's name on.

The holograms show an unborn baby in 3D, and are created from ultrasound scans taken in hospitals. Currently they are only available in Japan

Parents are given the hologram in a special presentation box, but in can be removed and carried in a wallet

'When an expecting mother has a check-up, a 3D/4D echogram is made, and that contains 3D data,' a spokesman for Pioneer told Diginfo.tv at the Optics and Photonics exhibition in Yokohama, Japan.

'So, we suggest taking pre-birth photos of the baby, by skilfully processing that data,'

The system is unique because it was create the holograms from computer files containing 3d information rather than requite the 'real' object be photographed.

The briefcase-sized printer can create  color card-sized holograms in 120 minutes with one color holograms taking 90 minutes. 

The service can also offer hanging pictures containing several holograms

'Previously, holograms were produced by making a model of the 
subject, shining two lights on the model, and photographing it,' the 
spokesman said.

'That method involved a lot of work, because it required a darkroom, knowledge of techniques, and specialized equipment.

'But with the device we've developed, even if you don't have the 
actual object, as long as you have a CG design, then that can be used to
record a hologram easily.'

Curerently the service is only offered in Japan, and pioneer did not reveal which hospitals it will be used in, or how much it will cost.

'This newly developed hologram printer does not require the complex photographical environment previously required for the creation of holograms, which included models to be photographed, vibration dampers and a darkened room, nor does it require any of the high level specialist technology or knowledge in terms of devices, optical system settings or exposure required by the old process,' the firm said.

'Instead it allows anyone to easily create holograms that is completely original and unique from 3-dimensional shape data such as computer graphics(CG).

Pioneer says the printercould be used in a wide range of areas, including photographs, commemorative goods, business cards. and even 3D maps.
