Wouldn’t it be handy if you could turn your washing machine on using your mobile phone?

Or if your vacuum cleaner could sense how dirty your floor is and highlight the spots you’ve missed?

While these concepts may have been a wishful fancy a decade ago, they could soon be finding their way into your home.

A home innovation space designed by Samsung in collaboration with interior designer, Kelly Hoppen, has put together a range of technologies that it believes will dramatically improve home life

A ‘home innovation space’ designed by Samsung in collaboration with interior designer, Kelly Hoppen, has put together a range of technologies that it believes will dramatically improve home life - and despite their futuristic   all are available to buy now.

Among the highlights are an intelligent ecobubble washing machine that can be controlled by your smart phone.

The Wi-Fi enabled washer is designed to stop you having to worry about the washing sitting in the drum all day, as you can start the washing cycle on you way home from the office.

The Samsung T9000 lets you convert spaces from fridges to freezers at the touch of a button

Samsung has placed this next to a 'flexible fridge' that can be arranged to meet different shopping needs.

Clever vacuum cleaners designed for modern homes with Motion Sync Design are also included.

These vacuums have special sensors that mean they can tell how clean your home is and which areas need cleaning the most.

The design follows LG robotic vacuum cleaner, unveiled in April, than can understand voice commands and even move towards the person speaking.

'Technology in the home is developing at an extraordinary rate and I think it’s a particularly exciting time', said Russell Owens, head of digital appliances, Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland.

'Not so long ago the thought of being able to turn on a washing machine with your mobile phone on your way home from work was something that was hard to imagine.'

Samsung also displayed its MEO cooking series that provides a range of co-ordinating Neo appliances, including single ovens, compact ovens, cook top, hood and warming drawers.

The oven range also features Samsung’s Dual Cook technology, meaning you can cook two different things at two different temperatures at once.

‘Our homes are so important to us – they are an expression of ourselves and places we eat, sleep, work and play,’ said Hoppen.

‘There is a natural synergy between design and innovation and it is important that the two work in harmony to create an enjoyable experience in your home.’

The Samsung Home Innovation space is located on the second floor at Harrods in London.
