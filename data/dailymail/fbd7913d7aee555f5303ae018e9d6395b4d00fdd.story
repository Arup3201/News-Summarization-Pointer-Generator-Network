They have been blamed for casting a shadow over urban areas and occasionally creating a 'death ray-style' beam of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street.

So architects have now designed skyscrapers which don't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area in a bid to tackle the problem of shade encroaching on public space in London.

The revolutionary 'No Shadow' design is the brainchild of architects NBBJ, who used a computer program to design two buildings, which work together to disperse and refract sunlight.

They are designed so that when one building creates shade, the other can act as a huge curved mirror, allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow.

The theoretical development has been touted for construction at the Greenwich Peninsula, close to the O2 Arena, but similar buildings could be constructed in cities all over the world.

Christian Coop, NBBJ's design director, said: 'The relationship between the sun and shadow is the relationship between the two buildings.

He said the project is about 'improving the quality of our urban environment... finding a way in which we can have the tall buildings we need without losing natural light on the areas below'.

Mr Coop hopes that architects will use this type of modelling to see how their designs will affect the light levels around their buildings.

He said the method could also be adapted to control how much sunlight is reflected at different times of year. 

It is hoped that the design would avoid a repeat of London's disastrous 'Walkie Talkie' dubbed the 'Walkie Scorchie' which directed  fierce beams of sunlight capable of melting cars on the street.

Peter Murray, head of the New London Architecture (NLA) forum, said the 'No Shadow' design was a 'perfectly feasible' theory.

He added  that one of the problems people have with skyscrapers is the long shadows they cast: 'If you can reduce that, that must be a good thing.'

Planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high-rise buildings in central London, pictured is the Gherkin, The Cheesegrater and The Walkie Talkie 

Dr Philip Oldfield, an expert in tall buildings at the University of Nottingham's Department of Architecture, said: 'What's great about the project is the focus on tall-building form and shape, not only to look dramatic, but to contribute to creating a comfortable space at ground level.'

Described by the NLA as a 'veritable tsunami of towers', most will be apartment blocks rising from a minimum of 20 storeys to the current permitted maximum of 75.

Sydney's One Central Park has moveable mirrors that reflect light onto shaded areas below or block the sun during the hot summer.

The 'Walkie Talkie' was dubbed the 'Walkie Scorchie' after reflected light caused damage to cars and other buildings
