Dozens of photographs of First World War soldiers convalescing in an English village after being wounded on the Western Front were posted on the internet today by members of a new local history society.

Pictures show injured soldiers being cared for at a temporary military hospital in Shepreth, Cambridgeshire, nearly 100 years ago.

They were posted on the website of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society - www.oldshep.co.uk - as Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 2014.

'Fascinating': The photographs have been posted on the website of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society as Britain prepares to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the conflict in 1914

Two years ago, a postcard written to a Great War soldier in 1915 was found behind a wooden panel in Shepreth Village Hall, which was used as a military hospital between 1914 and 1919.

Villagers said several people, whose relatives had worked as nurses at the hospital, revealed that they had Great War photographs in family albums after reading about the discovery of the postcard.

Website designer Jordan Smith - one of the founders of the Shepreth Memory Preservation Society - has collated the images and included them in a feature about Shepreth during the First World War.

'Several families very kindly said we could copy the photographs and we felt that as many people as possible should be able to see them,' said Mr Smith, 20, who grew up in Shepreth.

Remembering the past: Villagers in Shepreth were prompted to come forward with the pictures after a postcard written by a Great War soldier was discovered behind a panel in the village hall two years ago

'We hope people find them as fascinating as we do. They show servicemen with nurses in and around the village hall - which hasn't changed that much in the past century.'

He added: 'We very much hope that people will recognise some of the faces in the pictures and tell us something about them.'

In December 2010, carpenter Alan Payne found a postcard, addressed to Private Edward Wolstencroft of the Royal Fusiliers, while fixing the Shepreth Village Hall floor.

Research by villagers revealed that the card had been sent by Pte Wolstencroft's sister Nellie.

Records also showed that he died in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.

Historian Chris East traced Pte Wolstencroft's family and villagers presented the card to a relative.
