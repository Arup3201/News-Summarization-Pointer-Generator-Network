The melting snow has revealed the frozen carcasses of more than a dozen more dead goats at a farm whose operators have been charged with animal cruelty.

More than 70 dead animals have been found at the Butterfield Farm Co. in Cornwall, Connecticut, over the past few months. 

The Department of Agriculture seized 74 sickly goats from the property in January.

Farm owner Buddy Hurlburt told The Republican-American that carcasses have been turning up in 'nooks and crannies' of the property. 

Two goat carcasses were found stuffed under a lawn tractor and a packing blanket, the site reported.

They were free on bond and have declined to comment.

The dozens of animals taken from the farm are now at a state animal rehabilitation facility in Niantic. 

It is unclear when the animals will be adopted. 

Bryson posted pictures of healthy goats frolicking in the field in what is believed to be the farm in Connecticut on her social media pages
