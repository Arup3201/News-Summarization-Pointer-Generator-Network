The frail mother of a Conservative MP was subjected to ‘disgraceful and shabby’ treatment in a Welsh hospital and later died in an ambulance delayed by equipment shortages.

Anne Main says she feels retired hospital worker Rita Wiseman, 80, was ‘let down’ by the NHS, for which she gave her entire working life.

Mrs Wiseman was admitted to hospital in May, after showing signs of a stroke, her daughter said. But hospital staff initially failed to diagnose the condition and even tried to send her home.

It was only at Mrs Wiseman’s daughter’s insistence – because of repeated hallucinations, visual impairment and signs of weakness – that she was re-evaluated.

A stroke was finally diagnosed after four days in hospital.

Yesterday, Mrs Main raised her mother’s case and her ‘concern’ about the state of the Labour-run Welsh NHS in the Commons during Prime Minister’s Question Time. David Cameron told her: ‘The NHS in Wales is in trouble and that is not because of hard-working doctors and nurses, but because of a Labour administration which cut the NHS and failed to reform it.’

Mrs Main told the Mail: ‘What happened to my mother was disgraceful. Nobody listened to her. Without someone advocating on her behalf, nothing would have been done. The staff were lovely but they were run off their feet.’

The ward on which, Mrs Wiseman, widowed from her husband George 20 years ago, stayed was hit by a shortage of basic items such as a water beaker or working television. After spilling water on one occasion, she was refused a change of sheets.

A former colleague of Mrs Wiseman also told Mrs Main her mother had been moved to a bed with dirty sheets unchanged from the previous occupant. Mrs Wiseman was discharged a week later and her family told it would be another five weeks before an occupational therapist could visit. She was looked after for six weeks by Mrs Main at her home, before returning to Cardiff to her own home, which had been fitted with a panic button. Her son stayed with her.

The day of the occupational therapist’s visit on July 23, Mrs Wiseman had a fall when her son was out collecting prescriptions, and pressed her alarm. It took 15 minutes for initial help to arrive from the council and another 20 minutes for an ambulance.

There were ‘substantial’ delays after the paramedics decided to use an inflatable mattress used to protect patients against spinal injuries. There was no valve, so they had to call another ambulance for extra parts.

Mrs Wiseman, who had been drifting out of consciousness as she waited, deteriorated further on the way to hospital and was rerouted to resuscitation but died before it could be carried out.

Mrs Main wrote to former Welsh Secretary David Jones before her mother’s death in July and later to Welsh Parliamentary Under-Secretary Baroness Randerson.

The Tory MP for St Albans said: ‘I was horrified when they initially said my mother was going home before a stroke had been diagnosed. She was so obviously unwell and in my view unfit to be discharged.’

A coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying Mrs Wiseman’s head injuries from the fall were so severe that hospital staff could not have saved her.

But Mrs Main said: ‘My mother spent her working life in the NHS, at another Cardiff hospital, St David’s. The hospital where she was treated seems to have gone to rack and ruin.’

Alice Casey, chief operating officer for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘We would like to offer our condolences to the family and sincerely apologise for any distress. The health board is fully committed to investigating and addressing these issues.’ The Welsh Ambulance Service said: ‘We have robust systems in place to ensure faulty equipment is serviced and repaired. We would like to express our sincere condolences.’
