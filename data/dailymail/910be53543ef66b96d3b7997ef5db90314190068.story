A former nurse is suing the NHS after she tripped up on a broken parking barrier in a hospital car park.

Pauline Fowles, 55, claims she suffered a fractured shoulder when she fell over the metal barrier while visiting a friend at Southend Hospital in Essex.

She has submitted a damages claim, for up to £25,000, against Southend Hospital at Southend County Court.

The claim argues the hospital was negligent in leaving the broken barrier in the car park without warning signs

The claim argues the hospital was negligent in leaving the broken barrier in the car park without warning signs.

It also states Miss Fowles suffers 'ongoing symptoms of pain and loss of function in her left shoulder' as a result of her injuries sustained on January 27, 2010.

Miss Fowles, from Pitsea, Essex, had worked as a nurse at neighbouring Basildon Hospital for 25 years before starting her own hypnotherapy company.

The case is due to go to court in September.

Sue Hardy, chief nurse at Southend Hospital, said: 'We would like to sincerely apologise to Miss Fowles for the distress caused by the injuries she sustained.

'The hospital has admitted liability and the National Health Service Litigation Authority is currently in negotiations with Miss Fowles’ representatives.'
