The winners of this year's World Press Photo competition have been revealed, with harrowing portraits of disease and devastation among jubilant sporting moments on the list of victors. 

More than 97,000 images from 131 countries were submitted in 2014, with a touching image of a gay Russian couple in a tender embrace winning first prize. 

Jon and Alex by Danish photographer Mads Nissen was selected as the Press Photo of the Year 2014. The photograph's poignancy lies in recent anti-gay legislation driving homosexual couples in the communist country further underground. 

Among winners in other categories are images of a kitchen in war-ravaged Donetsk, African warriors stroking a rhino, and the heartbreaking site of the lost uniforms of 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram extremists in Nigeria. 

Below, a selection of images from this year's list of winners, found in full on the World Press Photo website.
