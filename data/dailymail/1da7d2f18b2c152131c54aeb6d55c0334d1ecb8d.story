A young mother with terminal cancer has told doctors she doesn’t want to know how long she has to live, so she can enjoy time with her baby boy.

Hayley Martin, 29, was given the all clear after battling bowel cancer and gave birth to her son, Freddie, in May last year.

She has now been told that her disease is inoperable and she is undergoing chemotherapy in a bid to prolong her life and spend time with her family.

Ms Martin, from Maidstone in Kent, had put her lack of energy down to being busy at work after struggling with tiredness for ten years.

But after being taken to hospital with stomach pains in 2011, she was diagnosed with bowel cancer.

After surgery and six months of chemotherapy, Ms Martin was told there was no sign of the cancer and against the odds, gave birth to her only child Freddie.

But when her son was just four months old, doctors told her that the cancer had returned and is now inoperable.

She has since been undergoing chemotherapy in a bid to control the cancer and prolong her life.

However, the young mother has said that she doesn’t want to know how long she has left.

Ms Martin said: ‘When you hear that diagnosis you feel for your family.

'I worried about my mum, dad and sister and how they would deal with it.

‘And, of course, I thought of not being able to see my one-year-old boy grow up. But after a few days I just wanted to fight it.

‘I don’t live with a terminal diagnosis and I haven’t asked how much time I have got. I just try to live a normal life.

‘I always do my make-up even when I’m 
having my chemo, and when I’m not in the ward I have different wigs that
 I wear. It just makes you feel better.

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England.

It is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel.

Symptoms include passing blood and unexplained changes in bowel habits, such as prolonged diarrhoea or constipation, as well as weight loss.

Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases develop in people aged 65 or older.

Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy.

If bowel cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stages, the chance of surviving a further five years is 90 per cent, and a complete cure is usually possible.

However, bowel cancer diagnosed in its most advanced stage only has a five-year survival rate of 6 per cent and a complete cure is unlikely.

‘I still work, I go out with my friends and on holidays and to the gym like everybody else.'

After her first round of chemotherapy Ms Martin had resigned herself to never having children, after doctors told her the treatment often renders women unable to conceive.

So when she and her fiancé Chris Griffin, 24,  found out they were going to have a baby, the couple were delighted.

Freddie arrived last September and is approaching his first birthday.

And Ms Martin said she hopes to tie the knot with Mr Griffin this summer.

She said: ‘When you have chemo you always have the fear that you can’t have children, but I was lucky that at that time I was clear of cancer, or that I thought I was.

‘I was over the moon when I found out I was pregnant - I didn’t know I had cancer at the time. He is my little miracle.

‘I know my little boy is going to be well looked after in the future.

‘I have already put his name down for the school I want him to go to and, of course, I have life insurance.’

Ms Martin said: 'When you hear that diagnosis you feel for your family. I worried about my mum, dad and sister and how they would deal with it. And, of course, I thought of not being able to see my one-year-old boy grow up. But after a few days I just wanted to fight it.' She is pictured here with her fiance Chris Griffin and son, Freddie
