A resort that allows rich tourists to pretend they live like millions of impoverished Africans in ramshackle shanty towns has been described as 'poverty porn'.

Emoya Estate claims the collection of corrugated metal huts on its five-star luxury game reserve gives holidaymakers the chance to experience life in a shanty town in 'a safe environment'.

However, unlike the genuine towns, tourists at the resort are given conveniences such running water, electricity and even Wi-Fi.

Tourists can pay to stay in an iron shack the mimics those lived in by millions of impoverished Africans

Unlike many genuine shanty town homes, rooms at the Emoya Estate include running water and electricity

The Emoya Estate shacks have painted walls, Wi-Fi access and even under-floor heating

It has been criticised as tasteless, insensitive and offensive to people who have no choice but to call the shacks home.

American political satirist Stephen Colbert said: 'At best, insensitive; and at worst, poverty porn'.

A
 night in one of the 'shacks' costs $80 (R850), only slightly less than 
the $98 (R1,000) average monthly wage of a South African domestic 
worker.

Unlike, those 
who have no choice but to live in the genuine shanty towns, the tourist 
version comes with a host of modern conveniences.

The rooms include under-floor heating and wireless internet.

Emoya Estate said a stay at the shanty town is an 'experience of a lifetime'

Conditions in the shacks are basic by modern tourist standards but still far more luxurious than some of the most impoverished homes in South Africa

The
 Emoya Estate, which runs a private game reserve, luxury hotel and 
conference centre, claims a stay at the shanty town is 'the experience 
of a lifetime'.

Its website says it is perfect for 'team building, braais or fancy theme parties'.

Guests can also experience an outdoor toilet or 'long-drop'.

The
 company states on its website: 'A Shanty usually consists of old 
corrugated iron sheets or any other waterproof material which is 
constructed in such a way to form a small 'house' or shelter where they 
make a normal living.

'A
 paraffin lamp, candles, a battery operated radio, an outside toilet 
(also referred to as a long drop) and a drum where they make fire for 
cooking is normally part of this lifestyle.'

Conditions in the shacks are basic by modern tourist standards but still far more luxurious than some of the most impoverished homes in South Africa.

There are sinks with running water and showers and the rooms are waterproofed and come with purpose-built flooring and comfortable beds.

The resort has prompted outrage from many people online.

Africa's
 Country writer Zachary Levenson said the concept was 'offensive' and 
implies that people choose to live in the basic shacks.

He wrote: 'No one wants to live in a shack, not a single damn person.'

Mail Online has contacted Emoya Estate for comment.
