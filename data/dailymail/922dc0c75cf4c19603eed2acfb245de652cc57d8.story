Police say Marsico and the young woman went to his office at Bellevue, (pictured) apparently for her to have a job interview and the alleged assault happened inside his office at 10 p.m.

According to police, the alleged victim met Marsico at an event at the Union League, a private members club in Philadelphia, reports CBS Philadelphia.

Police say the two then left and went to Marsico's office at the Bellevue, apparently for the young woman to have a job interview.

The alleged incident happened inside his office at 10 p.m.

His attorney, Fortunato N. Perri of Philadelphia, said, 'My client maintains his innocence, and we are continuing to review the allegations and charges,' reports Philly.com. Pictured: Marsico and his wife 

Marsico is a senior associate with Greenlee Partners - one of the largest lobbying firms in Harrisburg. Greenlee Partners said today: 'Effective immediately, we have placed Mr. Marsico on administrative leave from the firm'

Charges against him include aggravated indecent assault without consent, unlawful restraint/serious bodily injury, indecent assault without consent, simple assault, reckless endangerment and false imprisonment.

Marsico and his journalist wife were married by former Governor Ed Rendell last year - she has not made any mention of the incident on her Twitter page.

Her bio reads: 'Love sweets & my husband.'

Marsico is also the brother of Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico and a cousin, Ron Marsico, is a Republican state representative from the Harrisburg suburbs. 

Marsico is a senior associate with Greenlee Partners - one of the largest lobbying firms in Harrisburg.

As from today his name does not appear on their website, but it did previously state he 'has successfully worked on many local, state and federal campaign efforts.'

His LinkedIn biography and the Greenlee website indicate that he is a graduate of Villanova University and the Dickinson School of Law.

Greenlee Partners announced today: 'Effective immediately, we have placed Mr. Marsico on administrative leave from the firm.

'These allegations are inconsistent with the values of our firm, and we believe this move is best for all parties at this time. 

'The court system is the appropriate venue to address these allegations. 

'Therefore, we believe it is inappropriate to comment further at this time. 

'As we move forward, our thoughts are with the families involved.'

Marsico is free on $100,000 bail, and a preliminary hearing is set for 11 a.m. October 9.
