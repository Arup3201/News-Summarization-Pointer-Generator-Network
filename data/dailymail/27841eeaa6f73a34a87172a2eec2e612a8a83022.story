Sir Ian Kennedy's call for MPs to receive a £7,600 salary hike to £74,000 a year caused turmoil in Westminster, with all three party leaders angering their backbenchers by vowing to block it

The man who triggered public fury last week by demanding that MPs receive an 11 per cent pay rise is to be axed from his job as the Commons watchdog. 

Sir Ian Kennedy’s call for MPs to receive a £7,600 salary hike to £74,000 a year caused turmoil in Westminster, with all three party leaders angering their backbenchers by vowing to block it.

Now Sir Ian has had his bid to be reappointed as chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) rejected by Commons Speaker John Bercow.

Sir Ian had wanted his £100,000-a-year contract, which runs out next year, to be extended until after the 2015 General Election, when the  pay rise is due to take effect.

The Speaker’s veto has thrown an already demoralised Ipsa into further chaos.

One MP who has worked closely with the body said: ‘With all this leadership uncertainty, and the  hostile reaction to the rise, I wouldn’t be surprised if the board just resigned en masse.’   

The Mail on Sunday understands that earlier this month Ipsa’s board wrote to Mr Bercow requesting Sir Ian be reappointed to the chair unopposed. According to one well-placed source, the Speaker replied that he would not sanction it, citing  ‘legal’ grounds.

A new head of the body will now have to be found – just as David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband plan to hold cross-party talks designed to head off the rise.

As the law currently stands,  Ipsa’s recommendations are legally binding, meaning MPs cannot decline the rise. Their only option is to give the extra money to charity.

Last week, Sir Ian, 71, was accused of talking ‘utter nonsense’ after claiming that a new package of higher pay, with lower pensions  and perks for MPs, had ‘significant support’ from the public.

He added that any political interference in the decision would lead to ‘disaster’.

‘Part of the package is the part that they don’t like, but the package as a whole has significant support from the public,’ he said. ‘For example, the public is in favour of changing the pensions.’

However, according to polling  carried out on behalf of the watchdog, 88 per cent of the public are against a pay rise.

Sir Ian – a medical ethics lawyer who was knighted after chairing the inquiry into the Bristol heart babies surgery scandal – has endured a tumultuous four-year stint as the head of Ipsa, which was set up in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal to overhaul MPs’ pay and perks.

His appointment to the body was overshadowed by coverage of his friendship with Alastair Campbell, for whom he acted as his ‘phone a friend’ during a celebrity edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?

And in February 2004, Sir Ian was a guest of Tony Blair at Chequers, where he dined with Cabinet Minister Hilary Benn and former Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart.

According to senior Commons sources, he even had to be ‘talked out of resigning’ within hours of  taking up his post over press reports of the break-up of his third marriage.

Ipsa denies Sir Ian considered walking out.

Last night a spokesman for Mr Bercow said Sir Ian’s contract  extension had been refused because it was not ‘legally possible’.

A spokesman for Ipsa said: ‘Discussions were held about the situation when Sir Ian comes to the end of  his fixed-term contract. It is not  true to suggest that the Ipsa board is  considering a walk-out’.
