Firearms, cash and drugs including thousands of Ecstasy pills, cocaine and cannabis are what special task force police expected to find in dozens of raids across the country on clubhouses belonging to Australia largest outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG), the Rebels.

What the heavily armed officers of squads like Strike Force Raptor couldn't have known they'd find inside the abandoned fortress-like strongholds of the criminal gang is the hidden play rooms where toughened bikies relax and spend their downtime.

Behind iron gates and reinforced metal doors which police had to cut through with industrial electric saws, the strike force officers uncovered  bars, comfortable lounge rooms, pool tables and even an 'indoor beer garden' with shag pile bar stools.

The Rebels - described in court documents obtained by Daily Mail Australia as 'one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats' - are among the nation's growing bikie army.

Belonging to more than 100 chapters and 45 outlaw gangs, there are 6000-plus bikies nationwide, with the Rebels making up 2000 split into 70 chapters across the country.

The Rebels wear the Confederate flag on their club colours, which incorporate a death's head and '1 %' symbol, representing the outlaw gang principle that they present the one per cent of the population that doesn't adhere to society's rules.

The Attero task force was established in 2012 to 'disrupt, disable and dismantle criminal activities of the Rebels MC',According to Federal Court documents, Attero believes the Rebels OMCG 'has demonstrated an ability to increase its geographical influence, diversify across illicit drug markets and launder illicit profits'.

The Rebels has expanded from Australia to include international chapters in 20 other countries: Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, England, Fiji, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Laos, Lebanon, Malta, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and the USA.
