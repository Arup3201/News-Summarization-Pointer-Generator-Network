A British backpacker screamed for help for more than an hour in fear of being raped by the manager of an Indian hotel where she was staying.

Sachin Chauhan, the manager of the Hotel Agra Mahal where the incident took place, appeared in court today alongside one other man accused of harassing the woman.

The 32-year-old tourist, from Greenwich, London, injured herself when she eventually jumped from the hotel's second floor window in desperation.

She told police how the manager of the hotel, in the northern city of Agra, knocked on her door at 3:45am saying that he wanted to shower her and give her an oil massage, after she requested a 4am wake-up.

She is expected to to return to the UK after being admitted to hospital with minor leg injuries, while the hotel manager has been remanded in custody for 14 days.

The woman, who had been due to leave the hotel on Tuesday morning to travel to Jaipur, said she refused the man's advances and pushed him out of the room.

The woman said that Sachin Chauhan made repeated attempts to enter the room after she initially removed him and bolted the door

Describing him as 'insistent' in a statement to police, heard by the Daily Telegraph, the woman bolted the door, but the man allegedly remained outside trying to get in with his keys until 5am.

She told police: 'I was shouting at him to stop harassing me, I told him I wanted him to go.'

'I was too scared to leave my room as he was waiting outside. I was kicking the door and shouting for help but no one came.'

The manager of the hotel, which is situated close to the Taj Mahal, was yesterday arrested, while the British tourist was last night believed to be under police guard at another hotel.

Dubey described Sachin Chauhan as being 'drunk'.

 hotel guard, who the woman also alleges was trying to enter the room, 
was also arrested, with both men facing a potential seven years in 
prison if they are convicted of sexual harassment.

She added: 'I shouted at them to stop harassing me but it continued.'

After
 the repeated attempts to enter the room, the woman said she jumped to a
 balcony below her room before escaping down the buildings stairs.

Having
run into the road seeking help, the woman said 'no one would stop', but
 she eventually 'begged' an autorickshaw to take her to Rakabganj police station.

She said that a man approached the driver and tried to make him bring the woman back to the hotel.

She then jumped out of the vehicle and ran further before the driver returned and took her to the station.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are in touch with a British national and local authorities following an assault in Agra.

'They are now safe and we are offering consular assistance.'

Following the brutal gang-rape and murder of an Indian student last year, the Indian Parliament has passed a tough new law under which rapists will be faced with a minimum sentence of 20 years, double the current sentencing.

Convicts could also be faced with the death penalty if the victim dies during during or after the attack.

Superintendent Dubey said yesterday that the British woman thought she 'could be raped or murdered' if she opened the door.

He added: 'The woman panicked and leaned out of the window and screamed for help.

'When she saw that no help was 
forthcoming, to save herself, the woman jumped from the window and 
landed on the first floor balcony and ran down the stairs out of the 
hotel and on to a tea stall nearby.'

Attack: Five men suspected of gang-raping a Swiss tourist in central India last week

Outrage: A protester during a demonstration against the men who raped a student in December

The incident comes after a wave of 
attacks in India, and on the same day that the Foreign Office updated 
its advice to urge women travellers to be cautious in the country.

Last week, a 39-year-old  Swiss tourist was gang-raped  by eight men in Datia,  Madhya Pradesh.

In December, the fatal gang-rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi led to mass protests demanding government action.

In response, the government passed a 
law increasing prison terms for rape and providing for the death penalty
 in rape cases that result in death or coma.

The Foreign Office advises women to avoid solo travel on public transport, especially at night.

It adds: 'Reported cases of sexual 
assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual 
attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show foreign
 women are also at risk.'

The British High Commission in New Delhi said officials had spoken to the woman and were offering her consular assistance.
