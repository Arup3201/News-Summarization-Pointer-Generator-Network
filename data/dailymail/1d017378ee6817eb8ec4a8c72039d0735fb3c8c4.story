Nigella Lawson pays her children to work for her and 'makes them' appear on her TV cookery shows, she told a court yesterday.

Her admission came as details emerged of the gilded lifestyle of her two children by her late first husband John Diamond, and of Charles Saatchi's daughter from a previous relationship, Phoebe.

The young trio were supposedly given almost £200 a week each in spending money by one of the housekeepers on trial for stealing from their parents, and also enjoyed numerous meals out at Mr Saatchi's expense.

Miss Lawson's revelation about the paid work she gives her children was in response to questions at Isleworth Crown Court in London yesterday about her household spending.

She admitted that she had 'a way  of paying' the university fees of  her children.

Barrister Karina Arden, defending Francesca Grillo on a charge of defrauding Miss Lawson and Mr Saatchi, said: 'Were either of your children on your payroll?'

Miss Lawson, who has a fortune of around £20million, said: 'I think I've got a way of paying university fees by putting them through a payroll, totally legally, and I declare it.

'I'm afraid to say I make them appear in my television programmes.'

Asked by Miss Arden whether appearing on her programmes 'is the only job they do', Miss Lawson replied indignantly: 'No. When I'm testing a new recipe they will taste it as I go. They will do many things I ask of them.'

But Miss Lawson strongly denied a claim by Miss Arden that Francesca Grillo had used her family credit card with her permission to give the three teenage children cash so regularly it averaged £29,000 a year – almost £200 a week each.

Miss Lawson also rejected claims that Francesca would have had to use her family credit card to pay for restaurant meals and takeaways for the children.

Miss Lawson said the children could eat at several restaurants on  tabs established by Mr Saatchi, and said they could use the family PayPal account to order takeaways over  the internet.

The case continues.
