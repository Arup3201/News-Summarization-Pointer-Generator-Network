A mom of two is gunning for the New York Department of Education after her pencil-thin daughter was sent home from school on Wednesday with a letter informing her parents that she is overweight.

Laura Bruij Williams, from Staten Island, New York, was tucking her daughter Gwendolyn in for the night when the young girl asked her if she was fat.

‘She said, “Hey, Mom. The school told me I’m overweight.” And then she started jiggling her thighs, and saying, “Is this what they mean?’”

‘That was heartbreaking,’ the stay-at-home mom told the New York Post.

According to Gwendolyn’s Department of Education-issued Fitnessgram she is 4-foot-1, 66 pounds and has a Body Mass Index of 19 which puts her in the ‘overweight’ category rather than ‘healthy weight.’

The third grader, who attends PS 29 Bardwell, was one of more than 800,000 public school students, grades K through 12, who were weighed and measured back in November as part of an Office of School Wellness Program.

‘It is so unnecessary,’ Bruij Williams told Mail Online. ‘Parents should be in charge of the health of their own children and then it is something for them to discuss with their pediatrician.’

Bruij Williams took to Facebook to voice her anger at the New York Department of Education labeling her daughter as 'overweight'

health of their own children and then it is something for them to 
discuss with their pediatrician'

Instead of posting the information to parents, it was handed out at school.

Kids were told not to open the Fitnessgrams, but for many it was simply too easy to view the information which was only sealed with a small sticker.

According to Bruij Williams, several children were in tears on the school bus after they opened their Fitnessgrams and were shocked to find themselves labelled fat.

'Girls shouldn't be crying on the bus at 8 years old because they read a piece of paper saying they're obese,’ she wrote on her Facebook page as she and other upset moms voiced their frustrations with the Department of Education.

According to the BMI system used by the Department of Education, Gweddolyn was just one pound overweight.

However her mom says when she ran the same stats through another BMI tool and her daughter came out in the middle of the ‘healthy weight’ section.

'My daughter shouldn't be going to sleep and looking at her thighs and belly, wondering 'is this what they mean?' she said.

Fortunately Gwendolyn is a healthy, self-confident nine-year-old and hasn’t taken the ‘fat-shaming’ to heart.

‘I know that I’m not overweight, so why should I believe the New York Department of Education?’ said the young girl, who enjoys playing softball.

Her mom however is concerned about what 
these kind of letters do for the self-esteem of ‘other girls who don't 
have the same support at home.’

Williams visited her the school principal on Thursday. ‘She was sympathetic, but said the kids weren’t supposed to open it. My response is, they’re kids. How can you believe they’re not going to open it?’ Williams said.

‘It’s a very positive thing for some kids who are overweight, but we shouldn’t be putting these assessments in the children’s hands,’ the mom added.

The principal told Williams that they will consider sending the Fitnessgrams home next year in a sealed envelope with the report cards.
