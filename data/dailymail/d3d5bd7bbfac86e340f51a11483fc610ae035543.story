A Washington Redskins fan called the police after producers of The Daily Show set up a tense encounter between a group of the team's supporters and Native Americans activists.

Kelli O'Dell, 56, ran out of the room in tears after the heated confrontation that took place during filming of the yet-to-air episode at the Dupont Circle Hotel in Washington D.C.

The former teacher described how she was accused of 'psychologically damaging' Native American children and claims was 'cut off' every time she tried to speak.

The loyal followers signed up for the dedicated segment of Comedy Central show, presented by Jon Stewart, believing they had the opportunity to defend their team's name, in light of recent controversy. 

According to The Washington Post, they were led into a room and were initially interviewed by the show's reporter Jason Jones.

However, they were interrupted when the Native Americans, who had been hiding in a separate room, walked in mid-way through their discussion. 

They included members of the comedy group 1491 - who were said to have been flown in especially for the awkward confrontation.

Jones allegedly said: 'Wouldn't it be great if you guys had a conversation'. He then pulled out bottles of beer and chicken wings, and then stepped aside.  

Ms O'Dell, 56, said she 'felt trapped' in the situation and ran away in tears after it became too much for her.

Two days later she called 911 to explain what had happened - but the authorities told her no crime had been committed. 

She told The Post: 'This goes way beyond mocking. Poking fun is one thing, but that's not what happened.'

The tense encounter took place at the Dupont Circle Hotel in Washington D.C. during filming for the yet-to-air episode of the Comedy Central show 

She has asked producers of the show to leave her out when it is aired, but is not sue whether they will comply. 

'It was disingenuous. The Native Americans accused me of things that were so wrong. I felt in danger. I didn't consent to that. I am going to be defamed,' she added.  

Another fan, Amanda Blackhorse, said the situation had left her feeling 'dehumanized'.  

Brian Dorch, said he asked whether in advance whether they were going to come face-to-face with Native Americans.

He told paper that he was assured the panel with the Native Americans was planned for another date.

One of the Native Americans, Bobby Wilson, said: 'It didn’t seem strange or unfair on our end, considering that each of us has always been confronting racism on this level.'

A federal trademark board ruled in June that the Washington Redskins nickname is 'disparaging of Native Americans' and that the team's trademark protections should be canceled, a decision that applies new financial and political pressure on the team to change its name. 

The Redskins quickly announced that they would appeal and fight to keep their name. 

Yesterday, during The Redskin's game against the Philadelphia Eagles, a commercial for an up and coming episode of South Park was aired.

During the clip one of the characters, Eric Cartman, runs a business under the Washington Redskins name - seemingly highlighting the the creator's negative opinion of the name. 

The cartoon version of the Redskins owner Dan Snyder tells Cartman to stop using the name 'in the name of decency.'
