Crash: Perri Game, 21, was jailed in Surrey after she admitted dangerous driving and drink driving

A care worker slammed her car into a police roadblock while drunkenly driving the wrong way down a dual carriageway at 60mph, a court heard today.

Perri Game, 21, ploughed into unmarked police vehicles, which had blocked the three lane carriageway to try to stop her dangerous driving.

But instead of slowing down, Game - who was twice the legal alcohol limit for driving - ignored the patrol vehicles’ headlights and carried on with her journey on the A3 at Burpham, Surrey.

She then crashed into the police cars, injuring the officers and writing off two vehicles, before ricocheting into the central reservation.

A judge today jailed Game, of Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, for four months after she admitted dangerous driving and drink driving.

Judge Christopher Critchlow, sitting at Guildford Crown Court, was told that Game could not remember why she had got behind the wheel that night or why she had decided to travel to Staines, Surrey, on January 29.

However, she said she may have been going to see a friend to celebrate getting a job. Game was also banned from driving for three years and ordered to pay court costs of £630.

The judge said: ‘The only way that a major accident could be avoided and one that could have been serious or fatal, was for the police cars to block the middle and outside lanes of the southbound carriageway and you went into that police car at quite a speed.

‘Fortunately you were not too badly injured and the police officers were not either. This must be behaviour that the court punishes in this way, as it was such a bad example. I accept that you are ashamed and remorseful.’

Acting Chief Inspector Richard Mallett of Surrey Police said today that the two officers’ actions were brave and had prevented someone being killed.

Police constables Simon Down and Ed Stock were on patrol in the early hours when they were told a car had been seen entering the southbound carriageway of the A3.

After getting in front of traffic and bringing it to a halt, they created the road block and saw Game speeding towards them at around 60mph.

Chief Inspector Mallett said: ‘The video clearly shows the risks that our officers face in the course of carrying out their duties and demonstrates the bravery shown by Simon and Ed that morning.

Judge Christopher Critchlow

‘Their decisive action almost certainly prevented a catastrophe happening and stopped any other motorist being seriously injured or even killed.

‘The officers saw Game’s car driving towards them at speeds of up to 60 mph. In a brave split second decision Pc Down decided to deliberately manoeuvre to bring Game’s car to a halt.

'As a result of the impact both vehicles were severely damaged and were written off.’

Both officers and Game were taken to hospital with minor injuries after the horror crash. Pc Down suffered whiplash and abdominal injuries.

Wendy Cottee, prosecuting, told the court
 that Game had driven all the way around the roundabout before 
re-entering the A3 near Ripley, Surrey.

'This was a momentary lapse of judgement and a stupid course of action'

Stuart Western, defending

Stuart Western, defending, said: ‘This is obviously a serious incident. My client is aware of that and there is no excuse for her behaviour and it is very clear from her actions since that she accepts full responsibility for her actions and that she must be punished.’

He explained that Game had lost her job as a carer for the elderly and had suffered with depression and insomnia since the accident.

‘This was a momentary lapse of judgement and a stupid course of action,’ Mr Western said.
