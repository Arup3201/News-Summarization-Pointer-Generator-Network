He was the match-winner for Argentina against Croatia at Upton Park, and unsurprisingly Lionel Messi was a hit again on Thursday night when he was mobbed on his arrival in Manchester.

The 27-year-old, earlier seen pictured with Sergio Aguero and his international team-mates catching the train from London Euston station, had escorts alongside him upon his arrival in Manchester as he unsurprisingly proved to be very popular with the locals.

Both Messi and Aguero played an integral in their country's win against Croatia, with the Argentina superstar stealing the show yet again as he coolly dispatched a second-half penalty after the Manchester City forward was taken down in the area.

The duo will be hoping their mini tour of UK continues in a similar winning vein, with Messi understandably champing at the bit to face a Portugal side containing Cristiano Ronaldo and Co after a brief, yet successful stint in London.

The Barcelona forward posted on Instagram a picture of Aguero and himself in London before departing by train, with a message which translates in English to: 'London! next stop ???'

The 27-year-old will look to his international team-mate Aguero to show him the ropes in Manchester. Aguero is of course familiar with the city after nearly three-and-a-half years spent there since joining Manchester City from Atletico Madrid.

Tickets remain on sale for the clash at Old Trafford next week with adult seats starting from £40.
