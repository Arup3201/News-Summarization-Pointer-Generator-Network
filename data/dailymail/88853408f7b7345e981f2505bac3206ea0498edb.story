An Indiana couple got the shock of their life on Thursday night after shooting and killing what they thought was a bobcat - only to discover it was actually a leopard.

The incident occurred following a number of attacks against cats and dogs just outside of Charlestown in Clark County, Indiana.

Concerned for the safety of her own pets, the couple - who wishes to remain anonymous - contacted a local wildlife official.

This leopard was accidentally shot and killed on Thursday by a homeowner concerned that something was attacking local cats and dogs

They suggested the attacks might be the work of a local bobcat and recommended they keep an eye out for the bobcats, especially at night.

In a bid to end the attacks, the woman and her boyfriend decided to take turns watching the area surrounding their home. 

Late on Thursday night the woman was outside near her pool, when she saw a dark shadow moving about in the bushes.

She called to her boyfriend, who grabbed a gun and shot at the dark shadow.

The couple knew they had hit something after hearing a ‘horrible squeal’ but when they ran over to see what they had hit, it turned out to be the leopard.

‘The cat in these photographs has been identified tentatively as a leopard,’ Phil Bloom, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Natural Resources told WDRB News.

‘Perhaps an immature cat about nine months old. DNR is attempting to determine who it belonged to, or where it came from.’

Conservation officers believe the animal was someone's pet because it was in a healthy condition.

Leopards are not native to North America and a permit is needed to keep one in Indiana.

A mile from where the cat was found is the Wild life In Need refuge center. Owner Tim Stark told WDRB that for the past week he had set traps after receiving calls from a neighbor who had seen the large cat.
