With their luxurious interiors and powerful engines they are the cars of choice for the rich and famous.

But now Range Rover owners in London may not be able to insure their cars after high-end motor insurers have refused to insure expensive vehicles following a series of thefts across the capital.

Now, underwriters are understood to be refusing to insure Range Rovers unless owners have underground or secure parking.

In the past three months, insurers and insurance brokers have asked to meet Jaguar Land Rover to discuss the issue.

The cars are being targeted because of their ‘keyless ignition’ systems. Thieves have now found hand-held electronic devices available on eBay which can bypass the security feature.

Thatcham Research, the motor insurers’ automotive research centre, said that between January and July this year, 294 Range Rover Evoque and Sport vehicles were stolen in London.

During the same period, 63 BMW X5s, a rival to the Range Rover, were taken.

Among those refused cover was Keith Dowley, a commercial property adviser from south west London, who bought a Range Rover this month after his previous one was stolen.

He said Range Rover told him it was his matter to resolve.

‘I had to tell them, ‘No, this is your problem, I have just bought a £100,000 car from you, if I can’t get insurance, I can’t drive it, and if I can’t drive it, I don’t want it’,’ Mr Dowley said.

He eventually secured cover from another provider.

A spokesman for Jaguar Land Rover said: ‘Our line-up continues to meet the insurance industry requirements as tested and agreed with relevant insurance bodies.

‘Nevertheless we are taking this issue very seriously.’
