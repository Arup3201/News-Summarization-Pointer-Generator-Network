Auctioneers on a routine house inspection have uncovered a treasure trove of valuable antique items hailing from the 17th century.

The house was so filled with period furniture that the staff from Charles Hanson auctioneers said it was as if they had stepped back in time.

The black and white timbered property near Lichfield, Staffordshire contained furnishings including four poster beds, tapestries, longcase clocks and bible boxes.

Echoes of history: This picturesque room contains a joined-oak bedstead worth up to £1,000, a cupboard with a carved floral frieze worth between £300-£500 (left) and a carved blanket chest (right) worth up to £300

Craftsmanship: A Carolean-style wall hanging, which depicts figures in a wood, is expected to sell for between £30 and £40, while the mahogany longcase clock with a swan neck pediment is expected to go for £100-£150

The remarkable collection had been collected over many years by the husband and wife, both deceased, who owned the home.

Mr Hanson said: 'They put together a collection of the finest 17th century oak furniture and furnishings I have seen in my career to date.

'The collection felt as though one was wandering around a home in care of the National Trust or English Heritage.

'The quantity and quality of such market fresh furniture will create international interest and will also appeal to collectors who wish to acquire a piece of history from a romantic and turbulent period.'

Got the right time? A total of 14 longcase clocks were found in the house. The historically-significant collection was collected over many years

Heritage: A 17th-century joined-oak tester bedstead worth an estimated £500-£800. At its foot is an 18th-century blanket chest with a triple-panelled hinged lid and stiled feet worth up to £100

Handsome: As well as furniture, antique trinkets such as these vases and copper kettles were found throughout the house

Because of the abundance of oak coffers, oak press cupboards and 14 longcase clocks from the late 17th century, Mr Hanson added it felt like being returned to a period when Charles I was King of England.

Artisan: A William III walnut inset chest of drawers with brass pear-drop handles. £300-£500

Approximately 180 lots will be offered to buyers at auction on January 12.

A four poster bed in walnut, which dates to circa 1620, is estimated to sell for £1,000 to £1,500.

A fine oak blanket chest dating to around 1580 is expected to fetch between £300 and £500, while a fine oak and fruitwood dining table crafted in 1630 may sell for up to £1,000.

A painting found on the landing of the property depicting two young gentlemen, the sons of the Earl of Sussex, which was painted in 1670, is expected to fetch £5,000.

Hansons junior valuer Elizabeth Bailey said: 'The sale will start Hansons' year with a celebration of a period of antiques which we rarely see in private homes now.

'The beautifully crafted pieces have a degree of patination which coincides with their 400 year history.

'This is the type of furniture of which so much was lost in the Great Fire of London in 1666.'

The items will be auctioned by Hansons at their auction centre in Heage Lane, Etwall in Derbyshire, with a viewing day on January 11.

On the evening of the viewing day, the auction house intends to serve 17th century drinks and food.
