Dancer: Ballet talent Jack Widdowson has made a miraculous recovery after the street mugging in Cardiff last year and is dancing at the Royal Bern Ballet in Switzerland

After teenage ballet star Jack Widdowson had his neck broken by a mugger demanding his mobile phone he pledged he would once day dance again.

The 19-year-old who was viciously attacked during a night out visiting his brother in Cardiff was told doctors it was unlikely he would ever walk again, let alone take to the stage.

But the court heard that nine months later Jack has fought back to full health due to his fitness, strength and flexibility.

His alleged attacker Mohammed Mohamoed, 23, has admitted robbing Jack for his Apple iPhone last November but denies causing the injuries which had doctors fear he  would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair as a quadriplegic.

Doctors said Jack was held in a headlock and suffered spinal damage likened to a rugby injury before the young man was left unconscious on a canal tow path, Cardiff Crown Court was told today.

Jack, an apprentice with the Royal Bern Ballet in Switzerland, was attacked while visiting his brother who is studying at Cardiff University.

Cardiff Crown Court heard Jack was 'extremely drunk' at the end of the night out celebrating when he became separated from his brother.

Prosecutor Paul Lewis QC said: 
'Mohamoed was in the city centre centre and specifically targeted Jack, 
taking advantage of his extreme drunkeness.

‘He guided him to a secluded place where he broke his neck causing serious and life-threatening injuries.

‘He helped himself to his victim’s property and departed, leaving Jack to his fate.'

The court heard that minutes after 
the alleged attack Mohamoed was seen laughing and joking in the city 
centre, even kicking a football around with a group of boys.

Unemployed Mohamoed was later arrested at his home in Roath, Cardiff.

He
admitted meeting Jack and robbing him of his mobile phone which he 
later used to make a call to a friend in Italy before throwing it away.

But he claims Jack was unharmed when he left him in the dark alleyway in Cardiff Bay.

The court heard ‘very violent force’ was required to cause Jack’s injury.

Mr Lewis said: ‘When a consultant spinal surgeon first saw Jack he thought the injury would render him quadriplegic.

‘His
view was that Jack was held in a headlock - then his head and neck were
used as a lever. The injury was deliberately inflicted.

’Fortunately Jack survived and made a miraculous recovery.’

Paul Davies, senior spinal surgeon at
the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff who saved Jack's life, 
said: 'It was caused caused by some form of manipulative strangle hold.

'The neck would have had to be in a violent headlock and then the head pushed down and forward with considerable force.'

Dr Davies said the spinal damage suffered was similar to that seen in rugby injuries.

He said: 'The force it takes to do this damage on the rugby field is enormous.

'It can be life threatening. Eighty per cent of people with these injuries have some form of permanent neurological deficit.

'Jack has done remarkably well. That is down to the fact that he is very fit, an athlete really.'

Jack,
from Bath, Somerset, gave evidence through a video link saying he could
remember very few details of the night of November 5 last year.

Mohamoed denies attempted murder and an alternative charge of grievous bodily harm with intent.

The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
