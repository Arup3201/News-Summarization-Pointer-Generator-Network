Some of the first Dinky Toys ever made have fetched almost £50,000 at auction.

Two boxes containing 12 rare delivery vans from the firm's infancy in 1933 were snapped up by a private collector.

The miniature lead vehicles were the first to boast advertising, and the brands emblazoned on their sides – including Oxo, Kodak, Meccano and Castrol oil – are still going today.

The toys were valued at 2.5p in the 1930s but fetched almost £50,000 at the auction in Newbury yesterday

The 12 Dinky toys, including this one with the Hornby Trains on it, were bought by a private collector

Experts at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berkshire, were amazed when the toys, which cost the equivalent of 2.5p in the 1930s, fetched double their estimated guide price.

Toy expert Hugo Marsh said the vans were a 'collector's dream'. 

'The two boxes contain the first Dinky Toys ever made that featured advertising on them, produced in 1933 when the brand was in its infancy', he said. 

He added: 'To find one example of an early dinky toy is rare, and to come across a complete box of them is incredibly rare.

'To have two boxes, consecutively numbered, in the same sale is unheard of - up until now it had never happened before.

Toy expert Hugo Marsh said: 'Dinky Toys were a phenomenon and to this day their appeal is unending'

Palethorpe's, founded in 1852, is a British producer of cooked meat and pastry products and was particularly well known for its branded sausages

'The two boxes were individually owned by John Westcombe and Julien Loffet, two great collectors Dinky Toys who sadly passed away recently.

'Their families united the collections for this once-in-a-lifetime sale.

'Dinky Toys were a worldwide phenomenon and even to this day their appeal is unending.

'In 1933 each van cost sixpence - 2.5p in today's money - but now they are more valuable than the real vans would have cost.'
