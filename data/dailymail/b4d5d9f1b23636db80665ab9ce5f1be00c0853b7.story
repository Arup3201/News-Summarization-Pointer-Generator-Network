The first Range Rover production car, which set the benchmark for luxury 4x4s, is expected to sell for more than £150,000 when it comes up at auction.

Land Rover launched the Range Rover in 1970, describing it as the most versatile car in the world.

It was designed to combine the comfort and on-road ability of a Rover saloon with the off-road skill of a Land Rover.

Today, it remains the benchmark in luxury off-roaders and looks at home on a farm, outside the Ritz or in the car park of a Premier League football ground.

And it was this two-door, green model with the registration YVB 151H, which started it all - and it is expected to prompt a fierce bidding war among enthusiasts and investors.

The car was built between November 24, 1969 and December 17, 1969 before being registered on January 2, 1970.

Now known as the Range Rover Classic, the stylish two-door model was originally delivered to Michael Forlong, who produced two Range Rover promotion films.

It then had a number of owners before vanishing until the 1990s when an enthusiast discovered it.

He then spent six years carrying out a meticulous nut-and-bolt restoration on the off-roader.

The owner has now decided to sell the first Range Rover - known as #001 - and there is expected to be serious interest in it.

Silverstone Auctions will sell the car at its Salon Privé sale in London on September 4.

The car is being offered with an estimate of around £100,000 to £140,000, but it is thought it could still fetch considerably more.

It is also likely to catch the eye of Jaguar Land Rover, which recently bought dental entrepreneur Dr James Hull's huge collection of Jaguars.

In a statement, the auction house said: 'Having owned this iconic motor car for more than 20 years our vendor has decided it is time to pass the responsibility of owning YVB 151H to a new custodian.

'The sympathetic and meticulous restoration has proudly stood the test of time making #001 a hugely significant motor car worthy of serious consideration.'

The car is known as a 'matching numbers' model. This means the original chassis, engine and gearbox along with the original aluminium bonnet and bodyshell.

Despite having only two doors, the first Range Rover production car set the benchmark for luxury 4x4s

Under the bonnet is a 3.5-litre V8 engine which developed around 135bhp and gave it a top speed in excess of 100mph.

Nick Whale, the managing director of Silverstone Auctions, added: 'It is wonderful to be able to offer this iconic British model for auction at the UK's finest concourse event.

'These cars are incredibly popular and we expect a significant amount of interest when it goes under the hammer.'
