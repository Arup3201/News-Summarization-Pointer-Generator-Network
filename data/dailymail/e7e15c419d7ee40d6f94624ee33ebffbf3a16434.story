The United States cannot solve Iraq's problems with military force, President Barack Obama reiterated in a series of interviews taped on Friday that aired across several networks on Monday morning.

Only Iraqis can resolve the violent conflict tearing apart in their country, Obama said, and in order to do accomplish this, they must find a way to ignore their sectarian differences for the common good of their homeland.

'If they can't, there's not gonna 
be a military solution to this problem, Obama told CNN's Kate Boulduan.

'There's no amount of American 
fire power that's gonna be able to hold the country together, and I've 
made that clear to [Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki] and all the other leadership inside of 
Iraq.'

The U.S. can't go in and occupy every country in the Middle East facing turmoil, president Obama said in a series of interviews that aired on Monday morning

¿Unless we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, something that we can¿t afford, and it would involve over time accusations that we were occupying these countries,¿ Obama told Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski, ¿at some stage, they¿re gonna have to take responsibility for working together'

The U.S. neither has the resources nor the responsibility to be the world police in the Middle East, President Barack Obama emphasized in the interviews.

‘Unless
 we are prepared to stay indefinitely in all these various countries, 
something that we can’t afford, and it would involve over time 
accusations that we were occupying these countries,’ Obama told Morning Joe 
co-host Mika Brzezinski,‘at 
some stage, they’re gonna have to take responsibility for working 
together.’

America's military cannot run around the world playing 'whack-a-mole' with extremist 
groups, the president has repeatedly said throughout the last several 
days.

‘Keep in mind that our goal in 
Afghanistan was to decapitate Al Qaeda, which had carried out 9/11. That
 has been accomplished. Now Afghanistan is a sovereign country that is 
gonna have to deal with its own security,’

Last month the president announced that he would significantly draw down troops in Afghanistan by the end of the year.

The president has made clear that he would not put boots back on the ground in Iraq.

On Thursday Obama announced that the U.S. would deploy up to 300 military advisors to help train, advise and support the Iraqi army but made clear that the forces would not engage in combat with the Islamic radicals violently attempting to conquer the country.

Obama also dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to meet with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other foreign leaders.

The two met for roughly two hours this morning in Baghdad, and Kerry said afterward the meeting was productive.

According to the Associated Press, Iraqi officials familiar with the meeting said Maliki again asked the U.S. to launch air strikes against ISIL, and, once again, he was rebuffed.

Kerry reportedly cited civilian casualties as an area of concern.

President Obama has been credited with making similar remarks last week to members of Congress asking about air strikes.

Oceans apart: Secretary of State John Kerry and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki met face to face in Baghdad on Monday. The two government officials didn't appear to be on very friendly terms at a photo-op, but Kerry said the 100 minute meeting went well

Kerry, center left, flew to Baghdad this morning to meet with Maliki, right, and Iraq's other leaders to personally urge the Shiite-led government to give more power to political opponents before a Sunni insurgency seizes more control across the country and sweeps away hopes for lasting peace

The discussion between the two government officials was not expected to be friendly, given that Washington lawmakers have floated suggestions that the Iraqi premier should resign as a necessary first step toward quelling the vicious uprising.

Nor
 will it likely bring any immediate, tangible results, as Maliki has 
shown no sign of leaving, and Iraqi officials have long listened to — but
 ultimately ignored — U.S. advice to avoid appearing controlled by the 
decade-old specter of an American occupation in Baghdad.

Still,
 having suffered together through more than eight years of war — which 
killed nearly 4,500 American troops and more than 100,000 Iraqis — the 
two wary allies are unwilling to turn away from the very real prospect 
of the Mideast nation falling into a fresh bout of sectarian strife.

'The support will be intense, sustained, and if Iraq's leaders take the
 steps needed to bring the country together it will be effective,' Kerry said after the meeting.

Kerry also met with influential Shiite cleric Ammar al-Hakim, who 
heads a leading rival Shiite political party; Parliament Speaker Osama 
al-Nujaifi, one of Iraq's highest-ranking Sunnis; and Foreign Minister 
Hoshyar Zebari, a  Kurd.

Even before U.S. troops left Iraq for good at the end of 2011, a merciless Sunni insurgency was pounding the country with car bombs, roadside explosions, suicide bombings and drive-by assassinations, mainly targeting the Shiite government, its security forces and Shiite pilgrims.

Since the start of this year, and peaking this month, ISIL has overtaken several cities in Iraq's west and north, and over the past weekend was controlling several main border crossings between Iraq and Syria.

The three-year civil war in Syria — where Sunni rebels are fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiism — emboldened Iraqi insurgents who regularly traverse the porous border to gain recruits, funding and weapons, and battlefield confidence.

Years of political instability in Baghdad fueled anger against the Shiite-led government from Sunnis who felt powerless and saw their leaders targeted by al-Maliki's security forces.

A senior State Department official told the Associated Press the insurgents' recent march on Baghdad has been slowed, although concerns remain that ISIL will attack the golden-domed Shiite shrine to the Imam al-Askari in Samarra.

That city, in Sunni territory in north-central Iraq, was the site of a 2006 bombing that triggered the worst of the war's sectarian fighting. Last week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared that Iraq is currently in a civil war.

Kerry's meeting in Baghdad today comes after an announcement by President Barack Obama on Thursday that the U.S. would send up to 300 military advisers to Iraq but no combat troops

The official, who spoke to AP before Kerry's meeting, said the secretary of state would not ask Maliki to resign, as some in the U.S. and Sunni Arab states in Mideast have demanded, because 'it's not up to us.'

However, Kerry was expected to urge al-Maliki to quickly create a new government that is far more sensitive to Sunni and Kurdish demands for jobs, power and a fair legal system.

Currently, Baghdad is operating under a lame-duck government, as a new parliament that was elected in April has not yet selected its Cabinet ministers.

It took more than nine months to seat a new government the last time Iraq underwent the process, in 2010.

This time around, the State Department official said, Maliki and other Iraqi officials cannot risk exacerbating the political instability, and further inflaming the insurgency, by stalling a new and more inclusive government.

Both President Barack Obama and Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, also have urged Maliki to quickly form an inclusive government that promotes the interests of all of Iraq's ethnic and religious groups.

The State Department official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to be named in discussing the negotiations.

He described al-Maliki and other Iraqi officials as anxious about what, if any, additional help the U.S. might provide to help curb ISIL after Obama this week said he would send about 300 special forces troops to Baghdad to advise and train local security forces.

Obama did not rule out the possibility of also launching airstrikes against the insurgents, but that is not expected anytime soon, if ever, and he has adamantly said he will not send combat forces back to Iraq.

A CBS News/New York Times poll released 
this morning found that Americans are divided about how they want the president to handle the situation.

Half
 of Americans believe that U.S. does not have a responsibility to 
provide military assistance to the ailing country, while 42 percent said
 the U.S. was obligated to intervene.

Likewise,
 50 percent poll-takers said they believe the ongoing situation in Iraq 
will not increase the threat of terrorism in the United States, compared
 to the 44 percent who thought it would.
