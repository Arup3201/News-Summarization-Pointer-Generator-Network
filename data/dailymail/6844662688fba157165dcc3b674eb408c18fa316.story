A furious husband cut off his wife's head with a scythe after he arrived home from work to find she hadn't cooked his dinner.

Rintu Karmakar, 60, flew into a rage when he discovered wife Monu, 55, hadn't prepared a meal or done any of the house work and was fast asleep in bed.

He  told police that he first tried to cut her head off with an axe while she slept but that had failed so instead he beheaded her with a scythe.
