Tories expressed astonishment that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman, had secured the plum job on Newsnight

The BBC’s controversial new signing as Newsnight economics correspondent yesterday denied he was a ‘dangerous leftie’ – and revealed he once supported the leader of the British Union of Fascists Sir Oswald Mosley.

Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman, the Labour deputy leader, and economist at the TUC, was given the plum job earlier this week despite having little experience as a journalist.

Senior Tories were furious, saying that the appointment was proof that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the Conservatives.

Yesterday, Mr Weldon hit back in a 
bizarre online article in which he said he spent more time as a banker 
than a Labour adviser, and admits having had some sympathy when he was a
 teenager for Mosley.

After the year-long flirtation with the far right ended, he joined the Labour Party at the age of 18.

He wrote on his blog that it had been a ‘weird few days’ since his appointment was announced.

‘Given my current role at the TUC and
 brief stint as a Labour adviser, I fully expected my appointment to 
raise a few eyebrows,’ he said.

‘Even so I wasn’t quite prepared for the howls of outrage from some quarters.

‘Never mind that I have 
spent more of my career working in the apolitical worlds of the Bank of 
England and fund management than working for Labour or the unions, or 
that several right-wing economists and commentators familiar with my 
work warmly welcomed my appointment, or that I have frequently been 
critical of Labour’s economic policy.

Writing under a pseudonym, Duncan Weldon, the new BBC Newsnight correspondent, confessed to his flirtation with fascism

‘None of that seemed relevant to those who saw me as a dangerous leftie corrupting the BBC’s coverage of economics.’

He said he had come clean about his 
involvement with the far right - during what he called the 
‘hormone-charged mists of adolescence’ - following an approach from a 
Sunday newspaper. 

He said he had had a ‘brief and 
misguided flirtation’ with the ideas of the far right after reading a 
biography of Mosley by Robert Sidelsky, whom he said had ‘seemed to grasp the need to 
tackle unemployment where other politicians did not’.

He said he never attended any far right meetings and had joined Labour by the time he was 18.

A year later, he wrote a piece about his involvement with the far right for a student paper in Oxford, which appeared under the headline: ‘I was a fascist’.

The first paragraph of the piece said: ‘Like a lot of bad things this started with the Tory party.’

He said in his blog that the wording made him ‘wince’, adding: ‘I suspect I may be reminded of that line a few times in the coming months.’

Mr Weldon concluded: ‘Reflecting on the last week, it’s hard to escape the irony that I have been accused of being a dangerous leftie and also a fascist within 48 hours. I hope I’m neither.

‘I think I’ve got a long track record – from the Bank of England to the TUC – of examining the economic facts and letting the chips fall where they may.

‘The BBC is full of journalists from a wide range of backgrounds who left their political baggage at the door the day they started work. I’m confident that once in the job I’ll be able to do just that.’

Sir Oswald Mosley was the charismatic founder of the British Union of Fascists

Before he founded the British Union 
of Fascists, Sir Oswald Ernald Mosley was the MP for Harrow from 1918 to
 1924 being elected for the Conservatives before becoming independent 
and then joining the Labour Party.

He served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Ramsay Macdonald’s Labour administration.

He
 resigned from the government in protest at their unemployment policies,
 which he had tried to reform but found himself blocked by the party 
hierarchy.

He formed the 
New Party which amalgamated with the BUF in 1932. Mosley allied himself with Nazi Germany.

In October 1936, Mosley and 
his supporters decided to march through Cable Street in the East End, 
the home of a thriving Jewish community, to celebrate the fourth 
anniversary of the founding of the party.

By 
1pm on the day, around 2,000 of Mosley’s black shirts had gathered around Cable 
Street while around 500 Jews and anti-fascists congregated at Gardiner’s
 Corner.

They ran to Cable Street where they armed themselves with sticks and formed a
 barricade by overturning a lorry. At 3.30pm, Cable Street was the scene
 of some of the worse street fighting seen in England and Mosley’s 
Bentley drove into Dock Street where it was pelted with bricks.

Mosley’s supporters began chanting his name while the anti-fascists 
retaliated with the Internationale. Mosley then gave a Hitler salute and
 was advised by the police to drive back through the City of London 
rather than press ahead. Mosley gave a brief speech in which he accused 
the government of surrendering to “red violence and Jewish corruption”. 
At 4pm, the remaining fascists dispersed allowing the local to claim 
victory.

Mosley was interned in 1940 and the BUF proscribed. He was 
released in 1943, and, politically disillusioned in Britain, he moved 
abroad in 1951, spending most of the remainder of his life in France. He died in 1980.
