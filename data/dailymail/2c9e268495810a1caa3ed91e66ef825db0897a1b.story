Grey's Anatomy star Eric Dane and his pregnant wife Rebecca Gayheart had a lucky escape last night when strong winds sent a tree crashing down on their Beverly Hills home.

Gayheart, 40, was reportedly putting their toddler daughter Billie to bed when the eucalyptus tree was blown down shortly after 8pm on Wednesday evening.

Neighbours said nobody was injured but the house was one of many damaged as toppling trees crushed trucks and hundreds of thousands lost power in California yesterday during major storms.

Los Angeles firemen attended the scene and a truck was seen parked outside the property, 
located on N. Beverly Drive. The home is registered to Dane, 39, and his actress wife Gayheart.

Neighbours would not confirm if 
the couple lived there, but resident Susan Smith told KTLA that the 
'very pregnant lady' of the house was upstairs putting her baby to sleep
when the tree went down.

Ms Smith said: 'We all came running 
out of the house. Thank God we're all okay. We know there are a lot of 
live wires out there. These winds that came today were unbelievable.'

The tree snapped at the base and also caused substantial damage to a parked car.

'Everything else can be fixed, and they're okay,' Ms Smith added.

Firefighters shut off the power supply
after arriving to the scene while water and power 
officials assessed the damage to wire and cordoned off the area.

Gayheart is heavily pregnant with her second child with Dane. The couple announced the news in July.

Dane is best know for his role as Dr McSteamy in ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy.

More than 250,000 people in Southern California were without electricity this morning and about 26,000 more in the Santa Cruz 
Mountains of Northern California.

San Francisco was spared any blackouts
but thousands elsewhere in the Bay area were in the dark.

In Southern California, 23 flights were 
diverted and several delayed starting yesterday at Los Angeles 
International airport because of severe crosswinds and debris on 
runways, officials said.

Winds sweeping down through canyons 
created gusts of up to 80 mph through the night, with a 97 mph gust 
recorded last night at Whitaker Peak in Los Angeles County.

High wind warnings and wind advisories are in effect for parts of California, Utah, Nevada, and Arizona, New Mexico and Wyoming.

In Southern California, high winds blew over at least six semitrailers before dawn on highways below the Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mario Lopez. One trucker was taken to a hospital.

Northeast of Los Angeles, foothill communities were hard hit as the winds swept down the San Gabriel Mountains. A 97mph gust was recorded Wednesday night at Whitaker Peak in Los Angeles.

Pasadena closed schools and libraries and
declared a local emergency, the first since 2004.

The storm system was expected to bring similar, but less ferocious conditions as far away as Wyoming and New Mexico.Â 

The front will bring blustery weather to Missouri, Oklahoma, and Indiana, meteorologists said.

But high winds should begin to leave most of the West Coast on Friday.

Higher areas could see up to a foot of snow - and western Wyoming will see snow showers.

High temperatures will only get up to the 40s in most areas, apart from California where they could still reach 60F.

Forty people were evacuated from an apartment building after a tree 
collapsed, smashing part of the roof.

Two house fires, possibly from downed power lines, critically 
burned one person, seriously injured three others and forced seven 
others to flee. There have been hundreds of reports of wires down.

Overnight, a falling tree collapsed the canopy of a petrol station, but 
an employee shut off the pumps and no fuel spilled. Another tree toppled
onto a car, trapping the driver, who was taken to a hospital.

Along Huntington Drive, a major, six-lane thoroughfare that carries 
traffic into downtown Los Angeles, nearly every traffic light was dark 
across a distance of more than 10 miles.
