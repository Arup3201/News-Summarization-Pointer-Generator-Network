Two Russian athletes were photographed kissing on the podium as they received their gold medal at the World Athletics Championship in what has been seen as an act of defiance against their Government's attitude toward gay rights.

Kseniya Ryzhova and Tatyana Firova, who were part of the 4x400m gold medalist winning team at last week's event in Moscow, were snapped exchanging a kiss on the lips on the final day of the tournament yesterday.

It was not the first kiss the pair had enjoyed either - they had also shared a similar kiss directly after winning the race.

It was the final twist in an event that had been overshadowed by the issue of gay rights.

Sources inside the Russian team had denied the kiss was a protest at Russia's anti-gay laws.

Russian President Vladimir Putin 
signed a law in June that punishes the dissemination of information 
about homosexuality to minors, but activists say it can be used for a 
broad crackdown against gays.

Fears
 it could be used against participants at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics
 have sparked calls for a boycott of the event in some quarters and 
Russian officials have said all athletes will have to obey the law at 
the Games in February.

Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, is on the record as saying the law will be enforced, but yesterday said it would not infringe on the private lives of those at the Olympic Games.

NBC reported Mr Mutko as saying:
 'I can say once again that the freedoms of Russian and foreign athletes
 and guests who come to Sochi will be absolutely protected.

'In my view, Western media, media outside Russia, give more attention to this than we do in Russia.

'We
 want to protect our children whose psyches have not formed from the 
propaganda of drug use, drunkenness and non-traditional sexual 
relations.'

Swedish high jumper Emma Green-Tregaro, who last week appeared at a qualifying event with her nails painted rainbow colours in support of the gay rights movement, has been warned by the IAAF regulations that she had breached its rules.

Ms Green-Tregaro has since repainted her nails red following the rebuke.

Taking a stand: Sweden's Emma Green Tregaro, who qualified to Saturday's final, said painting her nails in rainbow colours was a 'statement of what I think'

Powerful statement: Emma, pictured in 2005, 
posted an image of her hails on her Instagram before the competition 
with the caption 'Nails painted in rainbow theme #pride'

General secretary of 
the Swedish athletics federation Anders Albertsson said before Saturday's high jump final
 that they had talked with the IAAF 
about the matter.

France 24 reported Mr Albertsson as saying: 'We 
have been informally approached by the IAAF saying that this is by 
definition, a breach of the regulations. We have informed our athletes 
about this.

'The code of conduct clearly states the rules do not allow any commercial or political statements during the competition.'

Mr Albertsson added that he personally had not put pressure on Green-Tregaro to repaint her nails, but 'understood from Swedish media her nails 
are now red'.

'If she knows she might be breaking the rules, 
that's a decision she takes, we don't have any objections on how they 
paint their fingernails,' said Mr Albertsson.

Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva 
sparked outrage among the gay community last week when she condemned the
 ‘stunt’ by Green-Tregaro, branding it ‘disrespectful’ and describing homosexual relationships as not ‘normal’.

Attack: Isinbayeva, pictured celebrating her weekend win, hit out at Swedish athlete Emma Green-Tregaro's support for the LGBT community

In a press conference last week, she had said: ‘It is disrespectful to our country. 
It is disrespectful to our citizens. We are Russians; maybe we are 
different to European people, to other people in other lands.’

‘We are very afraid, and this is my 
opinion also, that if we allow people to promote and do all this (homosexuality) in the street we are scared for our nation.

'We consider us normal people, where 
boys live with women, women live with boys. It comes from our history. 
We never had any of these problems in Russia and we don't want to have 
it in the future.’

She later blamed the interpretation of her comments on her 'poor English'.
