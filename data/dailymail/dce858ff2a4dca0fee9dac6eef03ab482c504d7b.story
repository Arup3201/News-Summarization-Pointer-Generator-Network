Sex And The City is to blame, in my opinion. Until Carrie and her cohort of fashion-obsessed, Cosmopolitan-drinking New York girlfriends burst on the scene at the end of the Nineties, most of us had never even heard of a mani-pedi.

My definition of grooming was a quick once-over with a razor and a session with Jolen cream bleach.

My best friend and I used to wander around our shared flat with our white moustaches, singing Jolene into our hairbrushes in an exaggerated Dolly Parton voice. The idea of 'professional' beauty treatments was alien to us - the sort of thing only the starriest of the starry had the time and money for.

Boudoir secrets: Home treatments give you the freedom to be yourself

There was a certain cachet in being low-maintenance, too. My generation defined itself as clever, not beautiful.

I was considered positively daffy for having the occasional Decleor facial (still one of the best). Most girls my age did their hair and nails at home, not least because there were no such thing as blow-dry bars and High Street manicurists back then.

Now, of course, they are everywhere. Even in times of economic hardship, women will still find a spare £5 for a file and polish. It’s the 21st-century equivalent of the so-called lipstick effect: a little bit of luxury that goes a long way to lifting the spirits.

If all this seems a little extravagant to my generation, my mother's lot find it positively baffling. Sixties and Seventies beauties - Joanna Lumley, Helen Mirren etc - kept their beauty regimes close to their chests. The boudoir was a place of privacy and secrets.

The name of the game was DIY. In fact, to this day Lumley continues to dye her own hair blonde - and try as I might I cannot get my own mother to give up her henna.

In some ways, though, there has never been a better time to embrace DIY beauty. After the crash of 2008, the beauty industry turned its attention to developing more cost-effective products for domestic use, with interesting results.

Last year, L'Oreal launched the first ever re-usable permanent hair colour, Mousse Absolue (£10.99 from Boots). Clever new packaging does all the donkey work for you, mixing the dye with the activator and delivering it in a light, non-drip mousse.

Unlike traditional home dyes, which have to be thrown out after use, you can keep this in the bathroom and use it to touch up roots.

If you like to err on the natural side of things, Naturtint (£9.99 from Holland & Barrett) is ammonia, resorcinol and paraben-free but still robust enough to cover greys. It comes in more than 30 shades, including some rich Duchess-of-Cambridge-style browns.

When we're not fiddling with the hair on our heads, we are trying to get rid of the stuff on our bodies. I loathe salon waxing - what with the smell of the wax, the gruesomeness of the paper thong and having to make conversation with a total stranger in the most awkward of situations.

I'm not sure the perfect home solution has yet been invented. The closest I've got is something along the lines of the Remington Cordless Body & Bikini Kit (£29.99, Boots). You'll never get a salon finish, but it will keep things tidy without too much fuss.

For brows and facial hair, salon threading has been a revolution. But unless you know what you’re doing, I wouldn't recommend trying to shape your own eyebrows. There is, though, a brilliant new way of removing unwanted facial hair at home: the Tweezy (£10, victoriahealth.com).

This canny little device consists of a metal spring and a rubber grip handle so you can just twist off excess hair from the root-like threading. It's incredibly effective and simple to use, and will save you a fortune in waxing.

Thus, tweaked and trimmed, and in view of the slightly cheerier weather, you may want to consider adding a bit of a glow.

Salon-tanning is big business, but it is a lot easier (and cheaper) to do it at home.

The choice of brand is entirely up to you; but the secret to a successful, streak-free fake tan is the humble tanning mitt: St Tropez makes one of the best  (£5, from boots.com).

Timeless: Joan Collins has released a beauty range

If you really want to know how to do good make-up, just ask a thespian. All actresses - famous or otherwise - do their own make-up. It doesn't matter whether you're the star of the show or a mere walk-on: you're all backstage together, fixing your faces.

Strange, then, that there aren't more actresses in the beauty business. I suppose Estee Lauder had Elizabeth Hurley, but I'm not quite sure the term 'actress' is the correct one to describe her talents.

Elizabeth Taylor had her own fragrance; indeed White Diamonds, which launched in 1991, is still a bestseller.

But apart from the occasional brand ambassadorship, few actresses have actually devised and endorsed their own make-up range.

Enter Joan Collins, who yesterday made her QVC debut selling her new Timeless Beauty Collection.

Given her age (80) and her appearance (fabulous), it's an appropriate name. I've seen Collins up close, too, and the effect is really quite enchanting, especially her skin, which is amazing. 

CRUSH... Balance Me Stellar Beauty Balm (£18)

If your skin hasn’t yet got over winter, try a pot of this multi-purpose salve for some skin TLC.

FAIL... Liza Minnelli

Liza, we love you. But you must promise that you will never again leave the house without wearing a bra.

Unlike many famous actresses of her 
generation, she has resisted the temptation to over-work her face in the
 manner of, say, poor Kim Novak, who is virtually unrecognisable.

Joan
 has aged well: she's not trying to recapture or preserve in aspic her 
youthful beauty, but she does know how to make the most of what she 
still has: those eyes, the famous lips, the exquisite bone structure.

The look of the range is very Joan: dark eyes and vivid lips:  this collection is certainly not for wallflowers.

Each lipstick is named after a Collins character, from Fontaine, a hot pink named after her alter ego in The Stud, to a rich burgundy courtesy of her other famous incarnation, the wicked Alexis (boo, hiss) in Dynasty.

The quality, as you would expect, is classy, with plenty of gold casing reminiscent of old-school Estee Lauder.

The range itself, then, is very much in her image, i.e. results-based and designed to flatter.

For me, the stand-out item is the Compact Duo, which contains a soft, very fine powder and is cleverly designed to incorporate a lipstick in the lid.

The eyeshadows are great, too: complimentary quads of colour so that you can vamp your look up or down according to preference.

My only real criticism is that I would have called it simply 'Joan'. After all, when you're a legend, surnames are superfluous.
