Mario Balotelli sparked a dramatic late comeback as Liverpool beat Swansea 2-1 in the Capital One Cup last night but then sparked controversy by tussling with former Anfield midfielder Jonjo Shelvey.

The Italian striker pulled out of the warm up before kick-off after feeling a twinge in his knee but was sent on as a last throw of the dice by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers as his team trailed by a goal with 20 minutes to go.

This time Balotelli didn't let Rodgers down as he scored the equaliser with a left foot volley in front of the Kop with four minutes to go. Then, in injury time, Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren scored the winner with a header at the far post after Swansea had been reduced to ten men.

However, there was still time for Balotelli to end the night on a sour note as he tussled with Shelvey after the final whistle.

The two players – along with Swansea captain Ashley Williams – seemed to clash after Balotelli flicked Shelvey's ear. The players parted as Shelvey went to applaud the Swansea fans but then exchanged words again in the players' tunnel.

Afterwards Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe said: 'That is Mario. He is working hard and he got his just rewards coming on and getting the goal. He works hard and I am glad he got the goal.

'It is great for Mario he wants to work all the time. He is a resilient lad with a tremendous talent. He wants to work on his movement and his finishing.'

Balotelli went in early during the warm-up, sparking a radio report that suggested he had been sent in for not taking the drills seriously.

Liverpool categorically denied this, though, revealing that he had to see the physio after catching his studs in the Anfield turf.

'He was sent in because he twisted his studs in the ground,' said Pascoe.

'He felt something in his knee so he was sent in to see the physio.

'We had to assess him. He felt something in his knee. He is fine but he went to take a precaution.'

Swansea looked on their way to a memorable win after taking the lead in the second half but were pegged back by Balotelli and then hit by a red card for Federico Fernandez that looked harsh.

'I can see why they are not happy,' added Pascoe. 'I didn't think it was a sending off. I think they both slipped.'

Swansea manager Gary Monk appealed for referee Keith Stroud to overturn the dismissal. He said: 'If anything, the Liverpool player's foot is higher than ours.

'Keith is a good referee, hopefully he will see sense and rescind it. I said to the boys that these decisions are happening.

'Hopefully they will stop it happening but if not we do it the hard way. I am not here to have a go at refs but it's being proven week after week.

'I am not talking rubbish, I am talking sense. I was emotional recently at Stoke but what is the point? It is not getting me anywhere.'

Asked about the incident between Shelvey and Balotelli, Monk said he hadn't seen anything. 'I didn't see that,' he said. 'No, nothing.'
