Forget your local Tesco, you'll be transported directly to the vibrant streets of Rio thanks to F&F's new menswear collection.

Inspired by the colourful street art of the city's Santa Marta area, the eclectic SS14 menswear collection is full of Aztec motif swimwear, printed shorts and bright tees.

The entire range is modelled by Karl Lagerfeld's favourite Jon K - who you may recognise from the brand's last campaign, as well as back-to-back Tom Ford adverts.

He's back! Jon K, the famed male model who has worked for the likes of Tom Ford and Karl Lagerfeld, is back for another season with F&F

The range offers cool casual wear via striped tees and washed cotton chinos in fresh shades of pink and aqua - hot for the season.

Blue chambray suits, priced at £60, are teamed with floral shirts and printed ties, while hooded jackets come in earthy tones of khaki, rust and yellow.

F&F describes the new collection as the 
'biggest and most comprehensive' menswear range it has ever delivered 
and it's gone to great lengths to showcase it in all its glory.

Cool casualwear: The range offers stripe tees and washed cotton chinos in fresh colour shades of pink (jumper, £16, shorts, £14)

Life's a beach: Jon K shows off the brand's Aztec printed swimming trunks (£10) on the beach themed shoot and, right, outerwear (Jacket, £30, T-shirt, £8, shorts, £14)

Suited and booted: Blue chambray coloured suits, priced at £60, are teamed with casual hoodies in the campaign

Making friends: Jon K gets to know the locals in his tropical beachwear shoot

Day to night: From casual daywear, jumpers and denim shorts (left) to lightweight suits (right), F&F hope to have every man's summer wardrobe covered

F&F collections are currently available in over 850 stores in the UK and over 2000 globally.
