Top Shop boss Sir Philip Green told the High Court today how he lent his fallen tycoon friend Scot Young £80,000 to help with the purchase and rent on his former family home.

The 61-year-old billionaire said in a witness statement: 'Scot explained his financial position to me and explained the problems he was having and asked me if I could help which I agreed to do.'

Mr Young, 51, and his estranged wife 
Michelle, 49, are fighting over money at a trial in the Family Division 
of the High Court in London.

Philip Green told the High Court he'd lent his friend Scot Young, right, money because he was having problems

Mrs Young, who says Mr Young is worth 'a few billion at least' and that 'there was a vast fortune hidden', claims he has hidden assets and has been helped out by his rich friends.

Mr Young is fighting his estranged 
wife's claim for a £300million divorce settlement, claiming he has lost 
his £400million fortune and is £28million in debt.

He says he went into 'meltdown' in 2006, and is now penniless and bankrupt.

'I have known Mr Young for about 10 or 15 years,' Sir Philip told the judge.  'I got introduced to him. I cannot remember how or where. I sort of became a friend.

'I wasn’t in business with him. I believe my family was offered an investment [in a company].  I think we made an investment in that company.'

He said he had never been involved in property deals with Mr Young and denied holding any sums of money on behalf of Mr Young.

Michelle Young, 49, says her estranged husband, who is engaged to Noelle Reno, 29, is worth 'a few billion'

A lawyer representing Mrs Young asked
Sir Philip what impression he had of Mr Young’s wealth prior to his 
'demise as he puts it' in 2006.

'No idea,' said Sir Philip. 'I assume
he was doing business. He was comfortable. I don’t ask people I do 
business with what their banks statements are.'

Sir Philip said he lent Mr Young £50,000 in September 2008 from his personal bank account to provide part of the deposit for the purchase of a house in Regents Park terrace, and a further £30,000 three months later for rent on the same property. 

He said the loans had not yet been repaid.

As he left the court, Sir Philip handed Mrs Young's QC Rex Howling a cheque made out to himself for £50 to cover the cost of his witness statement.

He told Mr. Howling: 'Give this back to your client', and Mrs Young smiled when the cheque was handed to her.

The Youngs, who married in 1995 and have two grown-up daughters, are fighting over money in the High Court

Richard Caring, the billionaire owner of restaurants The Ivy and Caprice, followed Sir Philip into the witness box.

He told the court he had loaned Mr. Young £50,000 to help him with his legal bills in September 2009.

He said in a statement: 'The reason I lent Mr Young this money is that I have known him for many years and he explained his financial position to me and explained the problems he was having.

'I decided to help him and his family.'

Under cross examination by Mr. Howling he said he had known him for about 20 years after being introduced as a close friend of a friend.

He had invested some money in one of Mr.Young’s business ventures, but lost his money.

Friend: Restaurateur Richard Caring told the court he had lent Mr Young £50,000 to help with legal bills

He said he had not been repaid the £50,000 but did not expect to be.

The Youngs married at Chelsea Register Office in March 1995 and split up in 2006. They have two daughters, Scarlett, 20, and Sasha, 18.

Mr Young is now engaged to 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, a former lover of banking heir Matthew Mellon, with whom he lives in South Kensington.

Mrs Young was granted a divorce in February on the grounds of Mr Young's unreasonable behaviour but will not agree to the divorce being made absolute, allowing Mr Young to marry the younger woman, until the financial arrangements are sorted out to her satisfaction.

Mr Young has been made bankrupt by the taxman over a £1.8m debt and claims to be penniless and living off of the generosity of friends.

The court heard how three years ago Mr Young was ordered to pay Mrs Young £27,500 a month in maintenance, but has never paid a penny and now owes her almost £1 million.

Mrs Young, who lives in Victoria, claims he has hidden assets abroad of up to £2 billion, and that he is still eating at top restaurants and visiting exclusive West End clubs.

She also claims he has been seen driving a Ferrari, and is living in luxury while she struggles.

Mr Young has admitted carrying round cash of £300 to £400 and receiving substantial cash gifts from 'friends' of £10,000, £7,000, and £5,000.

The hearing continues with judgment due to be given next Friday.
