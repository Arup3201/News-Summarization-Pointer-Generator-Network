Counter-terrorism detectives are now investigating after a home-made bomb exploded near a mosque in a hate crime attack.

The device exploded on Friday evening after residents in the Caldmore area of Walsall heard a loud bang similar to a firework.

The following morning the remains of the bomb were found 
by a local man in an alleyway adjoining the Aisha Mosque and Islamic Centre in Rutter 
Street.

Unaware of what the item was, he took it home and showed it to 
his wife.

Probe: Counter-terrorism detectives have been called in to help after a home-made bomb exploded near a mosque in a hate crime attack

Concern: Around 150 people were evacuated from their homes in the Caldmore area of Walsall on Saturday night while bomb disposal experts made the device safe. Forensic officers are pictured searching the area around the mosque

The mosque’s imam also later took the device's remains home before anyone realised their significance and contacted the police.

Around 150 people were evacuated from their homes on Saturday night while bomb disposal experts made the device safe.

Sharon Rowe, assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, said last night: 'The force is taking this attack against the mosque very seriously and we have a major investigation under way.

'To that end, I have called in support from all over the force, including the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, which has a number of experts supporting the inquiry.

'Specialist investigators have been working all day and continue to ensure that we maximise every opportunity from the crime scene.'

She added: 'At this stage we are keeping an open mind on a motive, but have recorded it as a hate crime.

Worrying: A loud bang was heard by residents late on Friday 'appeared to be consistent' with the device exploding

Police have stepped up patrols in Walsall to reassure the community, despite believing the planting of the device was an isolated incident.

While the motive for the crime is yet to be established, Sharon Rowe described the incident as 'despicable'.

Zia Ul-Haq, a committee member and spokesman for the mosque, told BBC WM the device was handed in on Saturday evening, and committee members called police at about 10.15pm because it looked suspicious.

He said: 'The package was found along the front boundary wall, on the corner of the building. It was found by one of our worshippers who after midday prayer was going home, and he had a look and it looked suspicious, so he picked it up and took it home.

'He showed it his wife and his wife said, "Well, it looks like something suspicious so you should take it to the mosque". So he brought it to the mosque but unfortunately there was nobody responsible in the mosque so he took it back home.

'Then he brought it back in the evening and then our imam had a look at it, and he took it home because nobody thought it was that serious.'

Eventually, several people, including members of the committee, got together at the mosque and decided to call police after assessing the item, which was reported to contain a battery.

'I said it looks suspicious and we decided to call the police. As soon as the police came they said we should not have handled it.'

Mr Ul-Haq thanked the police and the local council for their support following the discovery.

He said: 'They have taken this very seriously and they have supported us wholeheartedly and we are very grateful to the police and the local authority.

'We are not suspecting anybody, we are leaving it in the good hands of the police. We have beautiful relationships with the local community and we’ve never had any trouble at all at our mosque.'

Mr Ul-Haq told the BBC that the mosque had been in existence for more than 40 years and had very good relations with communities of all faiths, holding open days for non-Muslims.

'We never ever thought there was going to be a problem and people are still finding it hard that somebody could have targeted us.'

Bomb disposal experts from the Royal Logistic Corps attended the scene to ensure the device was safe and forensic teams spent several hours conducting a detailed search for evidence.

About 80 people evacuated from the area as a precautionary measure overnight were given shelter by Walsall Council, while 70 residents stayed with friends or family.

West Midlands Police said that almost 72 hours after the device exploded, officers from across the force continue to trawl CCTV and speak to witnesses.

Valerie Vaz, MP for Walsall South, said: 'This could potentially have been a very serious incident and I am pleased that nobody was hurt.

'Residents were shocked but settled when I spoke to them. They were understandably upset that their lives should be disrupted.

'I note that West Midlands Police are treating this incident as a hate crime. Given that investigations are at such an early stage we should not speculate further about the motives for this incident.'

Her comments were echoed by Walsall mayor and assistant police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, councillor Mohammad Nazir.

He said: 'If this proves to be an attack on a place of worship, then it is an attack on everyone - whatever their beliefs.'

Councillor Zahid Ali, portfolio holder for public health and protection, said: 'We stand shoulder to shoulder together as a community in support of the police.

'We’ve worked very hard with the community and shown that we were there for them when the evacuated residents needed shelter.

'Walsall has really shown its mettle in coming together and responding with calm determination.'

It comes after a number of recent incidents at mosques following the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, London.

Last week two men were charged in relation to an alleged arson at a mosque in Gloucester, and an Islamic cultural centre in Grimsby was hit by petrol bombs last month.

Mosques in Braintree, Essex, and Gillingham, Kent, have also been targeted.

Anyone concerned by the events or with information which may aid the investigation should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
