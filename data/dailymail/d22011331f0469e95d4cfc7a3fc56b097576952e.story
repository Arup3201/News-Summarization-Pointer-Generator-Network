A teenager was bombarded with abuse and threats by jealous Justin Bieber fans after capturing the Canadian popstar’s attention on Twitter.

Courtney Barrasford, 15, had posted a glowing review of his album,  Believe Acoustic, on the social  networking site.

Much to her surprise, a flattered Bieber reposted her message for his 34million followers – known as Beliebers – to see.

Bieber’s fans were less than impressed that she had attracted their idol’s attention.
Courtney was inundated with hate-filled messages, some telling her to kill herself and calling her vile names.

Bitter fans even circulated rumours 
she was pregnant with 19-year-old Bieber’s child. One girl, claiming to 
be a 12-year-old fan from the US, wrote: ‘Just tell her to die and leave
Justin alone.’

Another said: ‘I am a Belieber of him
since 2009 and he didn’t notice me. And you’re not even a f****** fan. 
You get noticed. OMG.’

A tweet to Bieber said: ‘U notice her n she’s not even a fan. I am but you won’t notice me :) Can anyone hear me crying?’

Abusive: While the tweets received by Courtney started off as fairly innocuous, they began to get more and more abusive as word spread

Jealous: Twitter users were angry that Bieber noticed Courtney's tweet but that their posts hadn't caught the Baby singer's attention

Another to Courtney said: ‘You’re so annoying. You’re not even a fan!’

Yesterday Courtney said: ‘I came back
from a drama class where everyone had been going on about how good 
Justin Bieber’s acoustic album was.

‘So I went on to YouTube to listen to it and then put my comment up.

‘About ten minutes later my friend sent me a message to say she had noticed something on Twitter.

‘It wasn’t too bad at first.

‘But then it started to get worse as more people found out. I had things like “you’re not a fan, go kill yourself”.’

Rumours: Beliebers began telling his Twitter followers that Courtney was dating Bieber and was pregnant with his child

Courtney added: ‘So far things hadn’t
got to me. But then they started saying I was pregnant with his child, 
and that my child would be a prostitute.’

Courtney’s mother, Tina, 45, a 
warehouse operator, is calling for regulation on social networking sites
to be tightened, and for parents to monitor children’s internet use.

She said: ‘It’s silly and has got out of control. It’s because of jealousy, and all because of a retweet.’

She added: ‘These sites need more monitoring by those that run them and parents of children that use them.

‘I wonder if the parents of the 12-year-old know about what their daughter has been posting.’

Courtney is now warning other online social network users to be careful about what they post and not to respond to any attacks.

She said: ‘I don’t think these people would say it face-to-face. But it’s still not nice  to hear. 
‘I would say to people to ignore it and stop using the site for a while.
Don’t reply to these people because they will only hate you more.’

The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre is dedicated to protecting  children online.

A spokesman said: ‘Social networks online are an increasingly important part of young people’s lives.

Latest release: Justin Bieber's latest album Believe Acoustic, which Courtney posted about

'They take risks online, perhaps more so than in the real world, as the 
computer screen provides the illusion of anonymity and safety.

‘Sometimes young people post without 
considering the consequences. It’s important they know what to do when 
something goes wrong.

‘In the first instance they should flag up offensive comments through the site’s reporting page.

‘Children can also access support 
through the charity BeatBullying, by phoning ChildLine or by reporting  
inappropriate sexual comments to CEOP.’
