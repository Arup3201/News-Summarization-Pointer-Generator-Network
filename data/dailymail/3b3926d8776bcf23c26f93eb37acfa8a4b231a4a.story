Rosie O'Donnell has gone ballistic...again. 

This time it's because producers of The View, backed by Whoopi Goldberg, want to draw in a younger audience and to that end add flash sales to the mix and finally fill the fifth seat - with a much younger host, a show insider tells MailOnline.

The View is desperately trying to find younger viewers. Hosted by Whoopi, 58, Rosie, 52, Nicolle Wallace, 42, and Rosie Perez, 50, the show is drawing in a much older AARP-friendly audience. 

ABC executives are intent on making changes in an effort to attract viewers in the 18-to-34 demographic, an age group coveted by advertisers. Currently, The View is being crushed in the 18-to-34 demo group by both The Wendy Williams Show (in first place) and new talk show The Real (in second).

The new: They've added blue, yellow and orange panels with matching lighting to the stage and a multicolored backdrop on the jumbo screen behind their desk

'ABC is really concerned about how poorly The View is performing with younger audiences. They never thought The Real would beat them out in key demographics and now they have to do something to make the show more youthful, which is hard when the average age of your co-host is 50,' a source at the network told MailOnline.

A popular trend with younger TV viewers on all talk shows is the flash sale segment, offering exclusive bargains to viewers. The Wendy Williams Show, The Talk and Good Morning America all regularly do segments where they announce on TV that the audience can buy an item at a super low price from the show's website for a limited time.

The View did a version of this segment last summer that was popular with viewers.

But when Whoopi announced yesterday that they would be doing the segment next Monday, dubbing it the 'Must-Have Flash Sale,' a shocked O'Donnell expressed concern on live TV.

'I didn't know we were doing that. That makes us like the home shopping club, what is that?' she asked.

Status quo: Her sweatshirt logo notwithstanding. Rosie's not happy with the way things are shaking out

Whoopi replied: 'It's something that allows us to keep changing our set.'

Rosie shot back: 'I didn't enjoy those, but maybe it’s just me. Keep going,' and then went into an uncomfortable giggle.

At the end of the show in the production meeting, O'Donnell went nuclear. 'Why didn't someone tell me about this segment? Who in the hell approved that concept?

'I hated it on the previous version of the show. I won't stand for this crap,' she yelled at producers, who sat and took their scolding.

The executive producer attempted to explain to an irate O'Donnell that the concept tests well with other shows and younger viewers love it. That made her explode even more. 

'Don't give me that bull***t,' she screamed. 'Stop trying to change this show to get younger viewers. This is not what I signed up for.'

ABC has already begun quietly scouting for a fifth co-host to join the panel - a younger personality under 35 who has a strong social media following and a definitive voice. 

The original format for The View centered around five co-hosts and network executives feel now is the time to bring that back.

Go with the flow: Whoopi seems large and in charge at The View these days

Talks of them adding a fifth new co-host as soon as January has also upset O'Donnell, who wants the show to go an entire year without a fifth person.

'Rosie O has made it clear she's not happy about the network looking for a fifth co-host. She hates the idea that they are trying to be competitive with the younger audience and thinks they should cater to the people who are currently watching the show,' says the source.

The View has had two changes to the set since their September 15 premiere show. Two weeks ago, they finally ditched the loveseats and low table that viewers dogged on social media. They added brown velvet chairs and a higher table, though co-host Wallace complained 'it still wasn't quite high enough.' 

Whoopi even griped on air about hitting her knees on the table.

On Monday, the show unveiled their second more drastic overhaul to the set. Gone is the all-white studio that research showed 'made the show feel old' and now they have added blue, yellow and orange panels with matching lighting to the stage and a multicolored backdrop on the jumbo screen behind their desk. 

They've also stopped the walking from the back of studio in Oprah Winfrey-like fashion and now enter on stage behind their desk.

'The set change and new entrance was done to make the show look and feel younger. They're trying anything now to appeal to a youthful demo. Only time will tell if it works,' offered the source.
