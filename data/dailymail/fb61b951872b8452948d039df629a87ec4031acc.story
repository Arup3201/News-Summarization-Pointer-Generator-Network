Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was the first black British Army officer

A campaign to honour Britain's first black Army officer with a posthumous medal for courage in the First World War was launched yesterday.

Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918.

He displayed 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe.

But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation that he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops.

Now Brian Binley, the Tory MP for Northampton South, where 2nd Lt Tull lived, is supporting an online petition started by Phil Vasilion the Number 10 website calling for the soldier to be recognised 94 years after his death.

He has been backed by members of the soldier's family and Michael Morpurgo, the author of War Horse, who has written a new novel, A Medal For Leroy, which draws heavily on his story.

Edward Finlayson, 61, 2nd Lt Tull's great nephew, said: 'Since we were very young we knew the story and as a family we have always been proud of him.

'We fully support the campaign to have the Military Cross he was recommended for awarded posthumously.'

He added: 'For us the most striking, moving and pleasing aspect is that his life is being used for good and as role model for others - his life is now included in the school curriculum and is used to promote anti-racism.'

Second Lt Tull was born in Folkestone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman.

By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London.

He played professional football for Tottenham Hotspur - making him the first black outfield player in England's top division - and Northampton Town.

On the outbreak of war in 1914, he volunteered for the Football Battalion, part of the 17th Middlesex Regiment, and fought in many fierce operations, including the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

He was commissioned as an officer in May 1917 and sent to Italy where he led his men and was mentioned In dispatches for bravery at the Battle of Piave.

Second Lt Tull was transferred to France to take part in a push to break through the German lines at Favreuil, in the Somme Valley.

In March 1918, aged 29, he was killed.

His men tried to retrieve his body from No Man's Land but they were beaten back by heavy enemy machine gun fire.

He was born in Folkstone in 1888, the son of a carpenter whose own father had been a slave.

His
mother, from Kent, died when he was seven and his father two years 
later. He and his brother were sent to an orphanage in East London.

Tull's football career began in 1908 for Clapton FC. He went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton.

In 1914 he volunteered for the army and was promoted three times while training.

Having
been sent to France in November 1914, he returned home in May 1915 with
'acute mania' but later took part in the 1916 Battle of the Somme.

On May 30, 1917 he received his officer's commission. He was sent to Italy where he was mentioned in despatches.

He returned to the Western Front where, on March 25, 1918, he was killed by machine gun fire. His body was never found.

Fellow officers Lieutenant Pickard and 
Major Poole wrote to his family: 'He had been recommended for the 
Military Cross and had certainly earned it.'

Last night Mr Morpurgo said: 'We don't know why this medal was not awarded. There shouldn't have been any black officers in the British Army.

'I think the medal commendation somehow got misplaced. We just don't know. But now is the right moment to be putting this right.'

Mr Binley said: 'I will be pushing the Government to award the Military Cross posthumously to Walter Tull.

'He was an incredible guy and this would be a great way of putting right a bureaucratic mistake from many years ago and one that would highlight a very important role model.

'I believe the reason why the bureaucrats turned it down in the first place was because he should not have been made an officer because he was black and it went against Army regulations at the time.

The MoD said no record of the MC recommendation was found in 2nd Lt Tull's service files at the National Archives.
