Former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne was involved in a rather strange incident during his side's 1-0 Bundesliga win against Augsburg on Sunday. 

The Belgium international had a loose boot flung at his groin by Tobias Werner which resulted in the Augsburg midfielder picking up a yellow card.

'It looked strange but there was no intention [to hit de Bruyne],' said Werner, who said he was trying to get the linesman's attention to let him put his shoe back on.

De Bruyne's side went onto win the Bundesliga fixture 1-0 thanks to a goal by Naldo

Wolfsburg defender Naldo scored to secure a 1-0 win over Augsburg in the Bundesliga, lifting the home side to sixth in the table.

The Brazilian shrugged off compatriot Caiuby, played a one-two with Sebastian Jung, and fired inside the far post in the 58th minute.

'We weren't good in the first half but we fought and tried to get the goal in the second,' said Naldo.

Raul Bobadilla should have scored for Augsburg in the 29th minute, before Halil Altintop forced a smart save from Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio.

Though Wolfsburg improved in the second half, Augsburg was left to rue missed opportunities. Alexander Esswein was thwarted by Benaglio late on.

'We had a lot of chances. They have to go in if you want to win the game. We tried everything,' added Werner.
