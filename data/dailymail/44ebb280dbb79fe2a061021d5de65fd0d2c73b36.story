More than Raheem Sterling’s form, Daniel Sturridge’s fitness or the future of Steven Gerrard, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will ultimately be judged on the nine players he signed last summer at a cost of £117 million.

The early signs are not good. As they return to Crystal Palace, the scene of Luis Suarez’s tears when the title was conceded in May, only full back Alberto Moreno could be labelled a success.

Others like Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Dejan Lovren — total spend £65m — have fallen far short of expectations.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be disappointed with Liverpool's slow start to the season 

Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert are yet to score a Premier League goal since joining Liverpool

Adam Lallana English, 26, M, £25m 

Verdict: Jury out. Way off his Southampton form. Only six Premier League appearances, average less than 70 minutes each.

Dejan Lovren Croat, 25, D, £20m 

Verdict: Hit. Played every minute of every top-flight game but can’t defend alone.

Lazar Markovic Serb, 20, M, £20m 

Verdict: Miss. Failed to adapt to the English game so far, isn’t playing regularly and low on confidence.

Mario Balotelli Italian, 24, F, £16m

Verdict: Miss. Has not lived up to his truculent reputation and has yet to score in the PL so far this season.

Alberto Moreno Spanish, 22, D, £12m

Verdict: Decent. Has played full 90 minutes in nine of 11 Premier League games. Settling in well.

Emre Can German, 20, M, £10m 

Verdict: Middling. A spectacular goal against Chelsea showed his talent.

Rickie Lambert English, 32, F, £4m 

Verdict: Miss. No goals and averaging 19 minutes over nine PL games. Bit-part player.

Javier Manquillo (Spanish, 20, D, loan Verdict: Settling) & Divock Origi (Belgian, 19, F, £10m) Manquillo taking time to adapt to a much-rotated squad. Origi on loan at Lille.

It was not meant to be like this. Rodgers was aware of the dangers of replacing superstar Suarez with an assortment of inferior players because he had seen how Tottenham squandered their Gareth Bale revenue 12 months earlier after he was sold to Real Madrid for a world record fee in excess of £85m.

Yet so far, Rodgers seems to have fallen into the same trap.

Balotelli and Lambert have failed to score a Premier League goal, while Lovren has looked shaky at the back.

Emre Can, a £10m buy from Bayer Leverkusen, strained a calf muscle on his debut in a pre-season friendly at Preston and then suffered an ankle injury on duty for the German Under-21s which kept him out for several weeks.

It was not until his goal against Chelsea that Liverpool fans caught a glimpse of why Rodgers went for the midfielder, whose gifts are technical rather than athletic.

Can, a German of Turkish family origin, acknowledges that the new recruits have taken time to settle. And he knows it is time for them to show their potential and lift Liverpool from a mid-table position towards a top-four spot.

‘We’ve had a lot of players coming in and it will take a little bit of time to adapt, but I am certain there will be better results,’ he said, speaking on a visit to the Liverpool Academy where he and other first-team players met and talked to the next generation of Anfield stars.

‘I struggled in the beginning because I was injured in my first game and couldn’t get back to 100 per cent fitness. I haven’t played many games yet, but the season is long so there is time for people to improve and come in and show what they have been bought for.

‘I see every day in training that we have a great team working together really well. We have been unlucky at certain points, but we know it’s about time that we got results, and I’m confident we can do that.’

Emre Can has been hampered by injuries since sealing a summer move from Bayer Leverkusen

Having sold Suarez to Barcelona, for £75m, Rodgers could have done without Sturridge suffering a series of injuries which will keep him out at least until the New Year.

Three players — Jordan Henderson, Sterling and Gerrard — are in contract negotiations and none of the trio are playing at their peak. Club captain Gerrard has been dismayed at the length of time it has taken to approach him over a deal and he knows there are clubs like New York Red Bulls who want him.

So, from being on the brink of a new era last season, Liverpool appear to be back in decline. Which is why it makes sense for owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner to look for added investment, and why the chatter around Dubai will not go away.

It is two weeks since Henry was joined by former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry in Dubai to meet Marwan Abedin, a prominent businessman in the emirate.

The club insist it was a private meeting unrelated to football and it is true that Henry and Abedin do share an interest in healthcare, the latter being the chief executive of Dubai Healthcare City while Henry and his wife, Linda, fund health research as part of their charitable foundation in Boston.

But Marwan is also on the board of Emaar, a real estate company which built the world’s largest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa. And he has close links to Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice-president and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and monarch of Dubai.

In addition, he sits on the Emaar board with Fadel Al Ali, the chairman of Dubai International Capital, the Sheik’s personal wealth fund, which agreed to buy the club in 2007 but lost out to Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Liverpool lost £48.85m last season and £40.52m the year before. #

If UEFA use the figures provided by the club’s holding company, UKSV Holdings, the prognosis is even worse: £69.67m loss recorded in 2013 and £54.68m in 2012. The club are on notice from UEFA for being in potential breach of the Financial Fair Play regulations and will submit their latest figures this month.

Under UEFA rules, a Dubai investor could not wipe out the debts but Liverpool could increase their sponsorship and commercial income through Middle Eastern links.

The rebuild of the main stand — the £75m investment would be exempt from UEFA rules — could be funded by Dubai. A naming rights sponsor would ease expenditure and a new club sponsor needs to be negotiated because the Standard Chartered deal expires in 2016.

It looks as though work will begin in the New Year and Liverpool have requested that their final game of the season is away in order to squeeze in an extra week of work. That will lift stadium capacity to 55,000 and the Anfield Road expansion will then take it up to 60,000.

Parry, with contacts in the Middle East and a direct line to Henry, might be the man to broker the deals to build the stadium.

First, though, they must exorcise the ghosts of Selhurst Park. With top-four hopes fading and their Champions League bid resting on a midweek trip to Ludogorets, it is time for Rodgers’ new buys to start showing their true worth.
