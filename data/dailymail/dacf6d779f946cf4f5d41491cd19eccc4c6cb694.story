The chimney leads to the first floor where Mr Gough's body was found. His body was found suspended two feet above the hearth

The body of a man who was found in the chimney of a solicitors firm has been identified as 42-year-old Kevin Gough.

The remains of the man, believed to be a serial burglar, were found by pest control workers in an 
unused part of the Victorian building at Moody and Wooley Solicitors in Derby.

Staff called a pest control company to get rid of what they thought was a pigeon, after noticing an unpleasant smell and infestation of flies in their office.

It is believed the body had been in the chimney for several weeks following an attempted burglary.

It has been revealed that Gough, who had no permanent address, has a string of previous convictions for targeting businesses.

In 2010, he was jailed for more than two years at Derby Crown Court after admitting two counts of commercial burglary and asking for another nine to be taken into account.

The firm's Senior partner Julie Marson described the incident as an 'awful tragedy'.

She said: 'We thought it may have been a pigeon
so we got a pest control guy to come.

'That's when we realised it 
looked like it might be a human body.

'That's when we called the police. A couple of officers came round and they confirmed it was a body.

'To think that poor chap could have been there for days. It's an awful thought. We just hope he passed away quickly.

Police are investigating the death of 
Kevin Gough. He has a history of breaking into buildings in the local area

Grim: An investigation has been launched to identify the man who has been found. Police will then try to locate his relatives

'You wouldn't wish this on your worst enemy.'

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said the death was currently being treated as ‘unexplained’.

He added: 'Police said forensic investigations were on-going at the scene, and they were keeping an 'open mind' about the find.

During his 2010 hearing, Gough said he had broken 
into a sandwich shop and a takeway on the same day a month before he was
sentenced, stealing cash and causing hundreds of pounds' worth of 
damage.

A number of firms in the historic 
part of Derby city centre where Moody & Woolley's office is located 
have been targeted in recent weeks.

Staff at the firm, Moody and Woolley, were said to be in 'shock'.

Martina Longworth, a partner at Moody & Woolley, said: 'It's very tragic. He must have family and friends around him and our thoughts go out to them.

'As a firm of solicitors we deal with probate matters, we deal with 
family matters including child protection so we're used to difficult 
matters, and our sympathy goes out to the man and his family and 
friends.'

Discovery: It is thought the body had been in the chimney for several weeks. The business is located in Derby city centre, pictured

Officers were called to the Grade II 
listed building on St Mary’s Gate in Derby city centre at around noon on
Wednesday after the body was found.

Builders were called in to investigate the damage, and found a hole in the roof.

They told workers at the business they thought there may have been an attempted break-in - but the incident was forgotten until the appearance of the unusual smell.
