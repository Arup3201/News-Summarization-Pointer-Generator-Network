Trish Vickers developed an elaborate technique to write her novel, using elastic bands

Police forensic experts have come to the rescue of a blind author, whose novel turned out blank when her pen ran out of ink.

Trish Vickers, 59, from Charmouth, Dorset, was devastated when she learned the opening chapters of her debut novel were missing.

But all was not lost - her family turned to the police for help and forensic experts worked during their spare time for weeks to recover the missing pages, using ultra-violet light to read indentations in Mrs Vickers' manuscript.

The grandmother lost her sight through diabetes seven years ago, and decided to take up writing to pass the time.

She developed an elaborate technique, 
using elastic bands to keep lines separated on the page - and quickly 
raced through the opening chapters of her first novel.

But disaster struck when her son 
Simon arrived to read over her work so far, and had to break the news to
his mother that the first 26 pages were blank.

Mrs Vickers explained: 'We battled with various 
ideas until we thought of the police. We rang them and asked to speak to
their fingerprint section.

'They said if there was anything they could do they’d be happy to help. I was gobsmacked.

Forensic Experts gave up months of their spare time to salvage Mrs Vickers' missing chapters

'I am so happy, pleased and grateful. It was really, really nice of them and I want to thank them for helping me out.'

Mrs Vickers has vowed to finish her novel,  called Grannifer’s Legacy, which is about a character called Jennifer whose life implodes.

She already has a few fans eager to see how the story unfolds. 'The police said they enjoyed the bit they read
and can’t wait for the rest,' she added.

And she insists being blind is no barrier to writing - just as long as she keeps her pen full of ink.

'Being blind is very restrictive in so far as going anywhere, but I have always been interested in writing, I have got one of those strange imaginations that runs riot,' she added.

'I have to remember what I have written down as I go along. I can remember how to write - I just can’t see what I have written.

'I started off writing poetry and this the first time I’ve attempted a novel.'
