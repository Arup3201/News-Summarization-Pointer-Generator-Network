A teenager had to be freed by firefighters using a crowbar after she got her arm stuck in a letterbox when she tried to let herself in after a night out. 

Jordan Armstrong, 18, thought she would be able to open her sister's front door in Colchester, Essex, after she arrived in the early hours of the morning to find the door was locked.

The former Colchester Institute student had been to a party near to her sister Anja-Marie's home and needed somewhere to spend the night after she felt it would take her too long to walk home.  

Jordan Armstrong had to be freed by firefighters after she got her arm stuck in her sister's letterbox after she tried to get into her house in Colchester. Friends posted pictures on Snapchat of her with misspelled captions

But she soon found she was unable to open the door and her friends called firefighters at 2.30am on Saturday to free her.

'I had a bit too much to drink and I couldn't walk all the way to my house so I thought I'd go and stay at my sister's but she wasn't home,' said Miss Armstrong. 

'As I was drunk, I thought my arm was bendy enough to open the door.

'The fire brigade and ambulance crew were absolutely amazing and even they had a laugh at my stupidity.

Miss Armstrong admitted she had been drinking and looking for somewhere to stay after the night out 

The teenager was freed by firefighters using a crowbar at 2.30am on Saturday after friends called for help

'Thankfully I woke up in the morning and I was fine.'

Paramedics were also called to the scene and Miss Armstrong's friends took pictures of the teenager's predicament on smartphones before posting them online through instant messaging app Snapchat.

Her sister only discovered what had happened when she read about the story on the internet on Saturday morning.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'Medics remained at the scene but the patient was not taken to hospital.'
