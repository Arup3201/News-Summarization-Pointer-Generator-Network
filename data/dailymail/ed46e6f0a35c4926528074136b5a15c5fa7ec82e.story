A house where a wealthy jewellery designer was tortured and burned alive has sold for well over its asking price, despite being put up for sale while the murderers were still on trial.

An estate agent said the real-life house of horrors in the village of Fernhurst, near Midhurst, West Sussex, which was left gutted by the blaze 'exceeded all expectations' even though the brochure detailed the horrendous crime.

The frank listing included grim photographs of the boarded-up semi-detached property, which was set alight by the killers in a bid to destroy evidence.

Macabre: The house where jewellery designer Michael Griffiths was burned to death sold for well over the asking price while his killers were still standing trial

Michael Griffiths, 59, was bound, tortured, and eventually killed by 'ruthless' gangsters searching for diamonds worth £40,000, a court heard.

He was attacked and doused in an accelerant before his once pretty home was set alight.

Prosecutor Christine Laing told Hove Crown Court the 'well-liked' victim was tortured in a 'protracted assault' involving weapons and strangulation.

Estate agent Henry Adams said contracts for the three-bedroom family home were exchanged while the defendants were in the dock.

The property had a guide price of £100,000, but the undisclosed selling price is said to have 'exceeded all expectations'.

It is believed the home was previously worth three times the guide price, at around £300,000.

Potential buyers were told they had a 'rare and exciting opportunity' to completely refurbish the 'deceptively spacious' house.

The advert added: “As the pictures show, the property has been badly damaged by fire and requires complete refurbishment.

'We are obliged to make all potential purchasers aware that there was a murder committed at the property.'

The house has a lounge, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, large gardens, a garage, driveway for two car, and external workshop.

The
 advert said: 'Stunning areas of National Trust and Areas of Outstanding
 Beauty can be found locally for walking and riding enthusiasts to 
enjoy.

Guilty: Zac Cowdery, left, and Harvey Mumford, right, broke into Mr Griffiths home and lay in wait for him to return. They were found guilty of murder and each sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 32 years

Simon Penton, 27, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 26 years in prison

'There are good road
 links to London and the south coast and Haslemere mainline station 
offers a fast train service to London Waterloo in around 52 minutes.'

Miss
 Laing said firefighters who found Mr Griffiths initially thought he had
 no legs because they had been “hog-tied” behind his back.

The
 antiques dealer and jewellery designer - who was single and lived alone
 - hoped to sell the two diamonds, which he kept at his home.

His mutilated body was discovered by police at 7am on January 24, 2012, having suffered multiple head injuries.

Zac Cowdrey, 24, from Staines, Surrey, and Harvey Munford, 23, from Sunbury, Surrey, were convicted of murder.

They both admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and conspiracy to burgle.

The pair were each jailed for life, and ordered to serve a minimum of 32 years.

Simon Penton, 43, from Sunbury, Surrey, admitted conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

He was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 26 years.

Damian Krafft, 27, from Shepperton, Surrey, admitted conspiracy to burgle and was jailed for three years.

A spokesman for Henry Adams estate agents said: 'Despite the history, the property attracted enormous interest.
