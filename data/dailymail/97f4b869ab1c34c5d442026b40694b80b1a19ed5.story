Sharon Minkin says she earns the equivalent of £70,000 a year in benefits because she won't go to work for a low salary

A mother-of-three says she is caught in a 'benefits package trap' equal to a salary of £70,000 a year.

Divorcee Sharon Minkin says she cannot afford to work – because it would leave her worse off and her children would no longer qualify for free university places.

Ms Minkin, 49 and her three children aged 19, 18 and 14 live in a spacious semi-detached three-bedroom with its own drive and 80ft garden in up-market St Albans, Hertsfordshire.

She drives a four-wheel Honda CRV and her 26 ft lounge boasts a 42 inch flatscreen TV.

Instead of going out to work, she spends her days writing novels – as yet unpublished – and walking her two pedigree white Samoyed dogs.

Her life is funded by the taxpayer, 
yet privately educated Ms Minkin – who before her divorce lived in a 
£1.6million seven-bedroom house complete with housekeeper – claims every day is a struggle.

'People
 might call me a scrounger but I don’t like living like this,' she said.
 'So my children don’t have to share a bedroom, I’m forced to sleep in 
the lounge. And having lived in a house with five bathrooms, it’s hard 
fighting over the one bathroom that we all have to share.

'Then
 whereas once I thought nothing of spending £230 on the weekly 
supermarket shop at Waitrose and M&S now I find myself having to 
choose between petrol and food from Morrisons and Aldi on the table.'

But
 she blames the government for creating a benefits ‘trap’ that means she
 can never earn so much money as she gets in handouts.

Ms
 Minkin, who recently turned down two jobs because they didn’t pay 
enough, says: 'It’s not that I can’t find a job – I went for two last 
week and was offered both of them - but myself and the children would be
 worse off.

'We couldn’t 
afford the rent on the house. And the children would have to take out 
student loans to fund their university fees. That means they would start
 their working lives in debt, something I wouldn’t want.'

A former chartered accountant, Ms 
Minkin once earned £120,000 working in the City.

But 18 years ago, after
 her second child was born she gave it all up to be a stay-at-home 
mother. Her ex-husband worked as a financial advisor and the couple had 
no money worries.

'We lived in a seven-bedroom house 
that I personally designed,' she said. 'Five of the bedrooms had their 
own ensuite bathrooms. We had a holiday home in Spain. The children went
 to private schools and I drove a £35,000 Touraeg car.'

Domestic
 chores were left to a live-in housekeeper, leaving Ms Minkin, who 
worked part-time for her husband, free to lunch with friends and go 
horse-riding every day.

Ms Minkin's financial 'woes' started after she divorced her husband

But 
after growing apart, in November 2007 the couple split and have since 
divorced. It was then Ms Minkin’s financial nightmares began.

'By the time we’d paid back our 
borrowings and debts, I was left with virtually nothing,' she says. 'My 
ex now claims he’s only able to pay me £13 a week maintenance for the 
children.'

Ms Minkin 
intended going back to work as an accountant but couldn’t afford the 
£5,000 plus fees necessary to retrain after such a long break, leaving 
her with the only option of claiming benefits.

She now receives £32,800 in benefits – which per month includes £1,400 housing benefit, £152 in council tax payments, £403 tax credit, £394 in employment and support allowance, £84 for free school meals and £180 for travel to school. Child allowance adds a further £130 a month.

On top of that, because she is on benefits, her eldest child qualifies for a grant, which pays for the £3,500 a year fees.

There is also an £800 a year bursary towards buying books. Her second child, who is off to university in October, will also have the £9,000 a year fees paid by the taxpayer and will qualify for help towards books.

Ms Minkin said: 'I always wanted to be able to put the children through university. I never wanted them to graduate with debts. If I get a job, my children will be forced to take out crippling student loans.'

She added: 'Because I’m on benefits the whole family qualifies for free dental care, free eye care and free school trips, which would cost extra £200 a month. I have totted up our benefits package and I would have to earn around £70,000 before tax to be able to live as we do now.

'Just to earn the basic £32,800 we receive in benefits, I would have to get a job paying over £44,000 a year.'

However, Ms Minkin says even a salary of £40,000 a year might not be enough to force her off benefits – because by the time she is taxed she could be left with less than she gets on the dole.

'I already struggle to feed us all and pay the bills. Luckily my retired parents – who are not rich by any means – help as much as they can.

'I’m sure people might say "oh, what a
 sponger she is" but although I don’t feel guilty for claiming benefits 
because for years I was a high rate tax payer, I'd much rather go out to
 work and earn that money with a proper job.

'I
 feel ashamed telling people I’m on benefits. However, I have to put my 
kids first. It’s no good me going out to work if I can’t afford the roof
 over their heads, food on the table and they have to go into debt if 
they go to university.'

She 
admits some people have suggested she save money by getting rid of her 
beloved dogs, 'But although they do cost around £40 a month to feed and I
 recently had to pay a vet’s bill for £300, they are elderly and have 
health problems. I don’t think anyone else would take them on.'

She also defends her decision to drive
 her seven year-old 4X4. 'We live in a rural part of St Albans and need a
 car. Following an accident a few years ago, I’m visually impaired in my
 left eye. So I need a car that is higher up so I can see the road 
properly.'

And she is unable
 to move to a cheaper property. 'Rents here are expensive. Although the 
house has been extended downstairs the bedrooms are really quite tiny.  
After living in such a big house, we couldn’t imagine being in something
 even smaller.'

Ms Minkin used to live in a £1.6million house. She now rents a property for £1,400 a month

Ms Minkin says it is also not worth her working part time. 'I can work up to 16 hours a week and still claim but when I looked into it, I would lose so much in benefits, I would end up working for free.'

Last week she went for two job interviews – and was offered both jobs. 'One was promoting a gym and the other was selling expensive wines. But the first one paid only £6.35 an hour and although the second said they expected me to earn over £25,000 a year, there was no guarantee. So I was forced to turn both down.'

A year ago Ms Minkin tried to set up her own party events business. 'I’d got as far as putting up a website when I was hauled into the benefits office and accused of fraud. After three months investigating they realised I hadn’t made a penny but it was a horrible experience.'

Ms Minkin believes the government should allow people to get a job or set up a business and still pay benefits, gradually reducing the amount as they earn more. 'That way I could have taken the job selling wines. Or seen if I could make a go of my business idea.'

She would also like to see more done for women like her returning to work after bringing up kids. 'There should be more financial help for women to retrain.'

Ms Minkin, who hopes publishing a novel will eventually get her off benefits, added: 'I am sure people will think, how outrageous it is that I get all these benefits. I bet this makes hard working people very angry.

'But anyone can fall on hard times and I’m just telling it as it is. I don’t like the benefits trap I find myself in any more than anyone else.'
