Tony Blair attracted the ‘wrong people’ to support Labour, a key ally of Ed Miliband claimed last night.

In an extraordinary intervention, Neal Lawson said the record election victories won by New Labour were ‘too big’, and had forced the party to pander to the middle classes while in government in order to keep their support.

Mr Lawson, a former adviser to Gordon Brown, is chairman of Labour’s Compass group, which backed Mr Miliband in the leadership battle with his Blairite brother David.

Neal Lawson has said that Tony Blair, pictured in 1997, attracted the 'wrong people' to support Labour, saying their record election victories were 'too big' 

Attacking New Labour on the Guardian newspaper website, Mr Lawson argued Mr Blair’s approach had squeezed Labour voters’ needs and fuelled Ukip’s growth.

His remarks came as the same website yesterday published an article by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls in which he claimed that Labour was again in the ‘centre ground’ of British politics.

In Mr Lawson’s open letter to Mr Blair he said the ‘problem’ was epitomised by the defeat of Tory Michael Portillo in 1997. 

‘Oh, how we cheered later that morning,’ he said. 

‘But in hindsight the wrong people were voting Labour. The tent was too big and you spent the next ten years trying to keep the wrong people in it – the very rich, for example. What meaningful project includes everyone?’

The comments follow a warning from Mr Blair that Labour was on course to lose the election because Ed  Miliband, pictured, had dragged his party too far left

Mr Lawson said Labour’s 1997 majority was’ too big’, adding: ‘You remark, almost with pride, that the population hasn’t shifted to the Left – well, what exactly was your job as a political leader supposed to be about then?

‘Had you not been so disdainful about anything remotely old Labour there would probably be much less support for Ukip now.’ 

The comments follow a warning from Mr Blair that Labour was on course to lose the election because Mr Miliband had dragged his party too far Left. 

Mr Blair later withdrew his remarks, saying he had been misinterpreted.

Mr Lawson’s diatribe came under immediate attack. Former minister John Spellar joked that Mr Lawson sometimes appeared to be ‘an agent sent to discredit the Left’.

And former Labour adviser Dan Hodges said: ‘Here’s my prediction for 2015 – the wrong people voting Labour will not be a problem for Ed Miliband.’

In his claim to the ‘centre ground’, Mr Balls said it was now the Tories who were adopting an ‘extreme and ideological’ approach by pledging to clear Britain’s deficit through cuts, rather than tax rises.

Vowing to also cut the deficit, he said: ‘Last month’s Autumn Statement was the day Chancellor George Osborne ceded the political centre ground to Labour.’
