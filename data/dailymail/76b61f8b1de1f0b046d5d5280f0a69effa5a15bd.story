Jailed: Paedophile language student Zdenek Junek did not have his record checked - but his hosts did

A language school did not check the criminal record of an exchange student who was a convicted paedophile - despite running a full screening on his British hosts.

Horrified Wayne Beavill and his wife Sharon - who have two sons aged nine and 13 - discovered their Czech lodger, Zdenek Junek, was a sex offender in his home country after police in Britain arrested him for similar crimes.

Junek, 32, was jailed for two and a half years last week for making indecent images of children after spending three months at the Beavills' home in Brighton, West Sussex.

The couple are furious at the language school for not running a records check on Junek, who was in their house with their two sons and was 'always in his room... constantly on his computer'.

Finance worker Mr Beavill, 44, said: 'Three police officers knocked on my front door saying 
they had to search the premises.

'They
 said it was about the student who was living with us after they caught 
him filming children in Brighton and they left with his computer.

'When we found out he was a convicted sex offender we all felt disgusted.

'It’s sick. I have two young boys and it’s scary to think he was living with them for three months.'

Mr Beavill and his wife, aged 43, were paid £260 a month to host students for the Education First School in Brighton.

They worked with the firm for 14 years and hosted more than 50 students, saying the work was less about the money - which has to cover a full B&B service - and more about helping the community.

Mr Beavill added: 'The language school CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check all the host families.

'But this guy wasn't CRB checked and was allowed to live in our house with our children... It's disgraceful.

Appalled: Wayne and Sharon Beavill, from Brighton, West Sussex, have been hosting language students for 14 years and both of them have been subjected to several Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks

'They haven’t given us so much as an apology and have just said it’s the first time it’s ever happened.

'But if they’re not checking students’ backgrounds how many others do they not know about?'

Mr Beavill continued: 'He was due to stay with us until August and I dread to think what could have happened if he’d not been caught.

'We now keep thinking of things that might have been dodgy - he was always in his room and constantly on his computer.'

Junek was jailed for 30 months last Friday at Lewes Crown Court for making indecent images of children, possessing indecent images of children and making an indecent video of children.

Mr Beavill said: 'The police told us he had a history of similar offences in his own country.

'No vetting required': The language school, based in this street in Brighton, said it complied with the law

'He seemed like a nice enough guy, kept himself to himself, so we never would have thought he’d do something like this.'

Junek's offences in the Czech Republic were also believed to involve indecent images.

The language school defended its policy and said it would never knowingly place a sex offender with a host family.

The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was launched in March 2002 and checks the criminal backgrounds of people who want to work with children or vulnerable adults.

Information is collected from government agencies and the police and controversially, often includes allegations which were never proven or prosecuted.

But the CRB - which was recently merged with another agency to become the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) - cannot access criminal records outside Britain, rendering it more or less useless in cases with foreign nationals.

Employers are advised to make additional checks with agencies in the worker's home country.

Vice-principal
 Bev Garth said: 'We were extremely shocked to hear of this 
case, as an accredited organization which complies fully with all the 
requirements of the industry.

'There are no standards or requirements for vetting visitors who are accommodated in private accommodation.

'We would never have knowingly placed someone with a known record within a family. The information is not available to us.

'We have discussed this direct with the host family concerned and apologised for any distress caused.'

A Home Office spokesman said checks can be made on the criminal history of Czech nationals, who are free to move between their country and Britain for work.

An application can be made to the Czech national criminal records office or embassy for £1.50.

A Sussex Police spokesman said the force would not have been aware of Junek’s previous convictions until he was arrested.
