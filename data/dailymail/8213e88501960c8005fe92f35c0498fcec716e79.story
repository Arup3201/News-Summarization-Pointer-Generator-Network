The 10 men who carried Baroness Thatcher's coffin into St Paul's Cathedral today were watched by an audience of millions - but as brave military veterans, they were used to the pressure.

The bearer party, which placed the casket on a gun carriage at St Clement Danes Church and then took it into the cathedral, was led by Nick and Bill Mott, two brothers who served together in the Falklands.

They were accompanied by more than 700 other members of the Armed Forces, including a marching band and eight horsemen.

Publicity: But the brave fighters are no strangers to pressure after serving in combat

The plans for the funeral, which 
apparently went without a hitch, were formulated before her death by 
Lady Thatcher herself, and signed off by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

She chose the hymns and readings, and approved the choice of St Paul's Cathedral for the ceremonial service.

Sir
Malcolm Ross, former Master of the Royal Household, and Major Andrew 
Chatburn were responsible for ensuring the plans were carried out 
according to Lady Thatcher's specifications.

The
military procession through the City of London was witnessed more than 
100,000 well-wishers who lined the route to pay their respects to 
Britain's first woman Prime Minister.

Soldiers, sailors and airmen from a number of different units were involved in the ceremony.

But
the central roles in the bearer party were taken by members of units 
with special links to the Falkland war of 1982 which is regarded as one 
of Lady Thatcher's finest achievements.

The commander of the party was Major Nicholas Mott, from the Welsh Guards, more than 30 of whom were killed when RFA Sir Galahad was bombed.

He was joined by his brother, Warrant Officer Bill Mott, while another Welsh Guardsman, Colonel Hugh Bodington, served as chief marshal of the procession.

All three fought in the Falklands and survived the Galahad attack.

More Welsh Guardsmen lent their services to the funeral by forming a guard of honour for Lady Thatcher's coffin as it entered St Paul's.

Guard of honour: Dozens of Welsh Guardsmen lined up outside St Paul's to welcome the coffin

Special: Welsh Guardsmen have a particular association with the Falklands War after the bombing of RFA Sir Galahad, which killed more than 30 of them

Commemoration: The Honourable Artillery Company fired a salute from Tower Wharf

Other members of the bearer party 
included Lance Corporal Tej Pun (Royal Gurkha Rifles), Lance Corporal 
James Steel (3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment), Corporal Carl 
Spence (9 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers), Corporal John Caulfield 
(40 Commando, Royal Marines) and Able Seaman Thomas Baker (Royal Navy 
Air Station Culdrose).

The party was rounded out 
by Sergeant Jason Buffham (4th Regiment, Royal Artillery), Lance 
Sergeant Paul Quayle (F Company, Scots Guards) and Lance Corporal Adam 
Jones (Queen's Colour Squadron RAF Regiment).

Major Chatburn, who choreographed the 
procession, previously co-ordinated the royal wedding procession two 
years ago as well as last year's Diamond Jubilee.

The
Household Division ceremonial staff officer said before the service 
that the plans were based on 'precedent and pragmatism' and would 
emphasise the Falklands connection.

The carriage was pulled by six horses from the King's Troop Horse Artillery, with two more riding alongside.

Captain John Cockburn rode at their head, riding an experienced mount named Mister Twister.

The gun carriage was followed by an 
escort party with members of all three services, led by Lieutenant 
Colonal Mike Vernon of the Coldstream Guards.

Funeral marches by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Chopin were played by 55 members of a Royal Marines processional band.

Organisers: Sir Malcolm Ross, left, and Major Andrew Chatburn, right, were key in planning the event

Moving: More than 2,300 guests attended the ceremonial funeral in St Paul's Cathedral

Readings: Amanda Thatcher and David Cameron read Bible extracts chosen by Lady Thatcher before her death

Plans: The former Prime Minister approved the choice of readings and hymns at her funeral service

Bands from the Royal Marines played an unusually hands-on role in the Falklands conflict and the first Gulf War, helping medics unload casualties from helicopters.

Other members of the military lined the streets of the City and stood to attention as Lady Thatcher's funeral cortege passed.

The Honourable Artillery Company was also involved as it fired a salute from the Tower of London.

Rehearsal: The pallbearers were pictured practising their duties early on Monday morning

Ephesians 6:10-18, read by Amanda ThatcherFinally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.

John 14:1-6, read by David CameronLet not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Fatherâ€™s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
