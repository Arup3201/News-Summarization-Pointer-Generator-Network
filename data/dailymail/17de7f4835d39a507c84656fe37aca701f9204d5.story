Ronny Deila insists Celtic are still in the race for Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard despite facing competition from some of the biggest clubs in Europe.

The 15-year-old, the youngest player ever to represent his country, spent this week at Liverpool – the latest in a string of giants to fight for his signature.

But Deila, who gave the player his debut at Stromsgodset before leaving for Celtic, believes the fact Odegaard, and not his club, is in control of his destiny, means his next move won’t necessarily be determined by who bids the highest.

Celtic boss Ronny Deila has refused to give up hope of signing 15-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard

‘He is a very good player but we have to stand in line - there are 20 clubs, maybe more, who want him,’ Deila said.

‘He has been to clubs all over Europe; to Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich Dortmund and Liverpool. PSG wanted him but he hasn’t had time to visit so there is some hard competition.

‘I have control over that situation, I know what is happening there. This is more about his choices. What is his thinking now? Is it go to a big club and try to break in there? Or go to a smaller club in not such a good league but (where) it easier to get into the first-team?

‘I think it is up to Martin. If he chooses Real Madrid, it would be what they want to pay. If he chooses Celtic, then there are different prices. He has one year left on his contract and I think it’s important Stromsgodset get money back for him.’

Deila says Celtic have not made their interest in Odegaard known officially to Stromsgodset but believes his contacts in Drammen will keep him informed of any developments.

‘I haven’t (made Celtic’s interest clear),’ he added. ‘But I have control over the situation.

‘I know what’s happening. He’s in the town where my kids live and I know a lot of people there.

‘We’ll see. If there are possibilities, of course, we will try it. But it’s a very hard competition.’

At 15, the teenage sensation is the youngest player ever to represent Norway

With five loan signings on Celtic’s books just now, Deila has not discounted the possibility of attempting to bring Odegaard to Glasgow for a season were he to head for the continent.

‘You never know, but we want to have players that we want to get something for if we develop them,’ he said. ‘You can’t have too many players from other clubs. We need to have players who we can earn money on or who can stay at our club.’

Asked if Odegaard was good enough at the moment to play for Celtic, Deila replied: ‘It’s very hard to say. He’s only 15 years old and will be 16 this month, but he is very special and every time he gets to a new level, he takes his chance. His attitude is great - he always wants to learn and he listens to everything you say, He’s special.’
