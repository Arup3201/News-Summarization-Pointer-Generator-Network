A natural cave discovered near the source of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami contains the footprints of past gigantic waves dating up to 7,500 years ago.

Experts say that the Indonesian cave, which is close to where the earthquake hit, could help them predict when the next tsunami is likely to occur.

And according to the research, the next disaster could be centuries, if not decades away.

The findings provide the longest and most detailed timeline for tsunamis that have taken place off the far western tip of Sumatra island in Aceh province.

The province is where 100 foot waves triggered by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake on December 26, 2004, killing 230,000 people in several countries.

The limestone cave, located within a couple hundred yards of the coast near Banda Aceh, is about three feet above knee-high tide and protected from storms and wind.

Only huge waves that inundate the coastal area are able to gush inside.

In 2011 researchers uncovered seabed sand deposits that were swept into the cave over thousands of years and neatly layered between bat droppings like a geological cake.

Radiocarbon analysis of materials, including clamshells and the remains of microscopic organisms, provided evidence of 11 tsunamis before 2004.

The disasters were by no means evenly spaced, said lead researcher Charles Rubin from the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

The last one occurred about 2,800 years ago, but there were four others in the 500 years before that.

And it is possible there were others. Researchers know, for instance, that there were two mammoth earthquakes in the region around 1393 and 1450.

The cave provides a rare natural record suggesting future generations living in the coastal area must stay prepared because disasters can occur in relatively short bursts or after long lulls

Mr Rubin said a big tsunami could have carried away evidence of other events through erosion. The scientists are still working to determine the size of the waves that entered the cave.

Mr Rubin said: 'The take-home message is perhaps that the 2004 event doesn't mean it won't happen for another 500 years.

'We did see them clustered together closer in time. I wouldn't put out a warning that we're going to have an earthquake, but it shows that the timing is really variable.'

The quake that triggered the 2004 tsunami surprised scientists because the fault that unleashed the megathrust temblor had been quiet for hundreds of years.

And since the last big earthquake had struck more than 500 years earlier, there was no surviving oral history that could have helped people understand the risk.

Since 2004, much research has been done to try to learn about the area's past by examining sand deposits, uplifted coral and GPS data.

Katrin Monecke, a geosciences professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts has been following the research.

She said: 'The findings are very significant.

'The sand sheets in the cave cover a very long time span and give an excellent idea about earthquake frequency.'
