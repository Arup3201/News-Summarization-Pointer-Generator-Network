A former Army officer and Afghanistan veteran has become the first person to walk the length of the Nile - braving blistering heat, war-torn regions and terrifying encounters with crocodiles on the 4,250 mile journey.

Levison Wood’s epic nine-month trek took him from the source of the world's longest river in Rwanda to the shores of the Mediterranean in Egypt.

The 32-year-old, from Staffordshire, journeyed through six east African countries and his astonishing exploits were filmed for a Channel 4 documentary which will be aired tomorrow night.

Epic journey: Levison Wood, who completed his 4,250 mile walk of the River Nile in September, poses with a member of the Mundari tribe in South Sudan

His monumental journey began in Rwanda in December 2013 - where the Nile's longest tributary is sourced - and finished in September last year. 

Mr Wood claimed that he left Africa with a sense of hope - despite a number of things going wrong on the expedition.

Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: 'People were desperately trying to get themselves out of poverty. I also saw how incredibly hospitable they were to a man walking through Africa.

'We had this terrible tragedy along the way. It really brought home the reality of the risks involved in undertaking a journey like that.'

Adventurer: Mr Wood, pictured in Juba, South Sudan in April, said the most challenging aspect of the nine-month journey was the weather and terrain he faced

Mr Wood is referring to the death of American travel journalist Matthew Power, who collapsed and died of heat exhaustion in Uganda in March, while joining the walk for a week.

The New York-based writer, who regularly worked for Outside, GQ, Men's Journal and other publications, died a few hours after losing consciousness.

He adds: 'It was a terrible time. I knew the heat stroke could be dangerous but his death was very sudden and totally unexpected.

'Because of where we were it was impossible to get any sort of quick rescue. Once your body goes over 39C certain parts start to shut down; it's difficult to recover from without immediate treatment.' 

Mr Wood later encountered danger in  South Sudan when militiamen attacked a UN compound while he was in the town of Bor.

He was caught up in a firefight with the deafening sound of gunfire descending on the town and ending with several refuges being shot dead and wounded.

Mr Wood added: 'It was a pretty hairy moment. It’s one thing dealing with that sort of thing when you are in the Army, but another when you are there without back up.'

He said while dozens of people were being killed nearby, he was threatened by a soldier.

The former soldier said: 'He put a gun to my face and said If I didn't leave the country he'd kill me.'

He still had 400 miles to travel in South Sudan but he and the production team were forced to travel by car and plane to neighbouring Sudan.

Before reaching the end of his trip it was estimated that he walked more than seven million steps.

Speaking in April, he said: 'I've always had a passion for Africa since I was young. 

'The river Nile has always interested me and I thought, what's the biggest expedition I could ever think of? And walking the Nile it was.

'We've had some close calls with buffalo, elephants and very close call with a crocodile in Murchison Falls (a national park in Uganda).'

Though he faced many dangers on the walk from both man and beast, Mr Wood noted that past explorers didn't have the luxury of a satellite phone or Google maps. 

The adventurer said that terrain and weather had provided the biggest challenges of the mission - ranging over mountains, savannah and the Sahara.

On average he walked 20 miles a day, but he was seldom alone. 

His guide from Congo, who goes by the name Boston, accompanied him.

And in South Sudan three AK-47 wielding soldiers from the commando battalion flanked him as security with another man on a bike ferrying supplies.

Mr Wood spent a number of years as an Officer in the British Parachute Regiment, where he served in Afghanistan fighting against Taliban insurgents in Helmand, Kandahar and Zabul in 2008.

He describes himself as an explorer, writer and photographer who has covered conflicts, events and stories around the world for over ten years.

The show Walking the Nile is on Channel 4 at 9pm tomorrow.
