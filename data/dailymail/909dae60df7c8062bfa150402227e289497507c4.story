Asil Nadir was facing jail yesterday 
after finally being convicted of stealing millions from his business to 
fund an extraordinary luxury lifestyle.

Almost two decades after he fled 
Britain on the eve of his trial, the 71-year-old tycoon looked wide-eyed
with shock as he was found guilty of plundering Polly Peck 
International.

The former fugitive is accused of 
siphoning off nearly £150million from the empire – one of the great 
success stories of the Thatcher era – causing it to eventually collapse.

As chairman and chief executive of the
conglomerate, which bought up Del Monte’s fresh fruit division and a 
majority stake in Japanese electronics firm Sansui, he is said to have 
smuggled enough bags of cash out of the country ‘to stand 300 times the 
height of Nelson’s Column’, weighing a colossal 135 tons.

But the mogul, who allegedly spent 
millions on Mayfair mansions, grand country estates, antiques and sports
cars including a Bentley Continental, a Bentley Turbo and a Ferrari 
Testarossa, infamously jetted off to his native northern Cyprus on the 
eve of his trial for fraud in May 1993.

It was not until August 2010 that Nadir returned to London claiming he could not live with the ‘burning sense of injustice’.

Yesterday, however, following a seven-month trial, a jury convicted him of three charges of theft totalling £5.5million.

In marked contrast to the scenes at 
the beginning of the trial when Nadir entered the Old Bailey grinning 
and waving to photographers with his glamorous wife on his arm, 
yesterday he was a picture of disbelief.

Dressed in a double-breasted suit with
a handkerchief in his jacket pocket, the flamboyant defendant stood 
motionless in shock, staring straight ahead with his jaw working 
furiously as the jury returned their verdicts.

His wife, Nur, who at 28 is 43 years his junior, fought back tears as she sat just a few feet away in a black dress.

Moments later she fled the court, 
telling reporters outside in a trembling voice: ‘I am very disappointed,
that’s all I can say.’

As the jury continued to deliberate on
further theft charges, she was whisked away from court in a silver 
chauffeur-driven Jaguar.

Nadir was found guilty of stealing 
£1.3million from PPI’s accounts to secretly buy shares in the company to
prop up its Stock Exchange value.

Every penny on the share price 
increased the value of Nadir’s publicly declared 25 per cent stake in 
the firm by nearly £1million.

He was also convicted of blowing 
£1million on antiques, buying a pair of antique fireplaces from 
Christie’s to furnish his lavish offices in Berkeley Square.

Some of the cash stolen in this 
tranche was also used to top up Nadir’s personal bank account when he 
went overdrawn after splurging on gifts including jewellery in the 
run-up to Christmas 1989.

He was also found guilty of stealing 
£3.25million, some of which was funnelled into an account Nadir’s mother
Safiye held in Geneva.

Money stolen in this transaction was 
ploughed into South Audley Management, which administered his family 
interests and the Baggrave Farm estate, an elegant stately home nestled 
in 2,000 acres in Leicestershire, part of which he planned to develop 
into a model farm.

Yesterday he was cleared of taking £2.5million to 
support his charter airline, Noble Air, and to settle part of his tax 
bill.

The jury is still deliberating on nine
other specimen charges of theft which relate to the disappearance of 
£33million and $2.5million.

But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, 
claims the ‘much bigger picture’ is that he stole £146million and 
$6.4million – which was equivalent to £3.9million in 1990 – in a total 
of 64 transfers.

Nadir is said to have ordered his 
henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from 
banks which he ‘dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family 
or associates’.

The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and 
August 1990 from three accounts held by PPI, a major international 
conglomerate which had over 200 subsidiaries trading in food, 
electronics, textiles and leisure.

Most of Polly Peck's business was based in Turkey and northern Cyprus, where Nadir (pictured here) went into hiding

At the time, Polly Peck was a major success story and one of the best performing companies on the Stock Exchange.

For a time, Nadir appeared 
untouchable, buying the Del Monte fresh fruit division in a deal worth 
$875million and acquiring a majority stake in Sansui.

But his empire began to crumble when 
the Serious Fraud Office launched an investigation into suspected 
manipulation of its share price in September 1990.

The firm was placed into 
administration the following month with debts of more than £550million 
and Nadir was charged with theft and false accounting.

He fled the country a few months later claiming he was a ‘broken man’ who could not receive a fair trial.

Now he faces a lengthy prison sentence.
