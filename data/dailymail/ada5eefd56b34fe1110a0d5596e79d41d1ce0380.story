The Germans are 'bewildered' by Britain's fixation with the Second World War according to a prominent historian who says it is time to move on from the obsession.

Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, says Germany has a 'huge admiration' for Britain and that it wants to build a proper relationship with the UK.

But he adds that the Germans are bewildered that Britain 'does not want to know' about the new, modern Germany.

Mr MacGregor's comments come ahead of a new Radio 4 series, where he will present a 600-year history of Germany, through 70 typically German objects from bratwurst to the Brandenburg Gate.

The British Museum will also display an accompanying exhibition to the series from next month.

But speaking about modern Germany in a interview with Radio Times, he says all the country wants is to be allies with Britain.

He explained: 'They have huge admiration for the political traditions, the political stability, huge admiration for the way Britain fought the Second World War and delighted by the sport.

'But they are very dismayed that when they come to Britain they are greeted with Nazi salutes! Bewildered that Britain doesn't want to appear to know about Germany now, but wants to freeze the relationship as it was 70 years ago.

Mr MacGregor says Britain's desire to cling on to World War Two, pictured Operation Overlord in 1944, blocks a proper relationship with Germany now

'And totally bewildered by this desire to cling on to a moment that was a long time ago and blocks a proper relationship with Germany now.'

His comments echo the famous episode of Fawlty Towers, where John Cleese's character Basil Fawlty hosts German guests but then accidentally offends them by talking about the war, goose stepping and impersonating Adolf Hitler. 

But Mr McGregor also adds that Germany has learned from its past, saying that they know that 'power' and 'acting alone' is dangerous and that they would be happy to have an ally in Britain.

However he conceded: 'Whether Britain wants to play that role, and whether Britain sees itself as wanting to be Germany's friend, I don't know.'

The programme, entitled 'Germany: Memories of a Nation' begins on Radio 4 on Monday, and will examine the key moments of the country's past using 70 different objects.

The series comes after Mr MacGregor and the British Museum joined the BBC for the programme 'A History of the World in 100 Objects', which has had 35 million downloads.

It has also inspired the idea of history being taught to schoolchildren through objects to coincide with the introduction of a tough new chronological curriculum.

Children aged five to 14 and their teachers are being encouraged to access images online and learn about them from reliable entries written by curators.
