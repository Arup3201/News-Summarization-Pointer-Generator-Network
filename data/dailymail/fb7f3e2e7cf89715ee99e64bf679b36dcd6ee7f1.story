The lawyer for the woman who accused Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston of sexual assault held a press conference today saying she wants Florida's Attorney General to investigate what she believes was a botched case.

Patricia Carroll, the attorney representing the woman, said that investigation had been into a rape victim and not the suspect - and claimed that detectives ignored the destruction of video evidence of the alleged sexual assault by Winston's teammate. 

The lawyer slammed the Tallahassee police department for failing to interview key individuals that her client had spoken to following the alleged attack on December 7, 2012.

Patricia Carroll, attorney for a Florida State University (FSU) student who said she was sexually assaulted in an incident involving FSU quarterback Jameis Winston, said the investigation was into the victim and not the suspect

She also said the lead detective got a search warrant for her client's cell phone and social media accounts but failed to do the same for Winston and his two companions immediately after the accusations were made.

Ms Carroll told WCTV: 'My client is alleging still that he raped her... 
She was raped, She sought help... and they failed her. This may be the 
politics of football.'

On December 5, Leon County State 
Attorney Willie Meggs announced there was not enough evidence to win a 
conviction against Heisman Trophy candidate Jameis Winston, mostly 
because there were too many gaps in his accuser's story.

The accuser didn't identify Winston until about a month after the alleged assault.

Ms
Carroll also claimed today that Winston's teammate secretly videotaped 
his friend and the woman in a sex act and admitted he had done so to
police.

Chris Casher, a defensive end for FSU, later told detectives he deleted the video, according to TMZ. 

Ms Carroll today accused the player of destruction of evidence - and said that authorities did nothing about this illegal move. 

The attorney also alleged today that her client had been drugged as she had memory lapses and sickness similar to symptoms seen from date rape drugs. Ms Carroll claimed that her client had not been given a blood test for date rape drugs.

The attorney's press conference is more unwanted attention for Winston who is a favorite to win the Heisman trophy, college football's most prestigious award. He is set to attend the presentation ceremony in New York City on Saturday night.

Football Awards show in Lake Buena Vista on Thursday.

On Thursday, a 911 tape was released for the first time which included more details from the night of the alleged attack.

A friend of the woman can be heard on a 911 call to university police in Florida in the early hours of December 7 last year.

According to the tape, which was just released as part of public records, the alleged victim was 'very shaken up, hurt and got hit'.

The dispatcher on the call says: 'She got hit? Does she know what she got hit with?'

The female friend, who is not identified, then said: 'No she says she like kept blacking out, like she only remembers pieces.

'She keeps trying to tell me the story but it's very in pieces.'

The caller then confirms for the dispatcher that the woman said she was raped but that she doesn't remember the identity of her alleged attacker.

Police interviews with Winston's friends, who were at his apartment on the night of the alleged attack, were also released on Thursday, according to ABC. 

The friends said that the young woman and the quarterback did have sex but that it was consensual

Winston's friends told police they saw the alleged victim perform oral sex on the quarterback and said she seemed 'more than willing'.

Winston spoke out for the first time this week
after sexual assault charges against him were dropped.  

The quarterback was part on the winning 
team this weekend who beat Duke 45-7 to take a place in the ACC 
Championship game against Auburn.

In a post-game interview, ESPN reporter
Heather Cox quizzed the star quarterback on the dismissed charges. 
Winston said: ''I gotta get more mature. I've gotta get better at everything I do.'
