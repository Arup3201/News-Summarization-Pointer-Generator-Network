The Co-op Bank was last night battling to reassure millions of customers it does not need a bailout from taxpayers – after its credit rating was downgraded to ‘junk’ status.

Ratings agency Moody’s warned that the bank might need ‘external support’ amid spiralling losses on bad loans.

It assigned the lender the same ‘junk’ credit rating that bailed-out nations Greece and Portugal received in 2010. This marks a humiliating blow for the Co-op, which was last year awarded the accolade of Europe’s ‘most sustainable bank’ by the Financial Times for the third year running.

The Moody's credit ratings agency raised doubts about the Co-Operative banks ability to raise funds to plug gaps in its balance sheet

The lender used Twitter to reassure its customers that it does not need a taxpayer bailout

Yesterday the boss of its banking arm, Barry Tootell, stepped down with immediate effect. 

The downgrade comes just weeks after the Co-op pulled out of a £750million deal to buy 632 branches from Lloyds, blaming the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’.

Consumer experts said under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme customers’ deposits in Co-op licensed accounts are protected up to a total of £85,000. 

Co-op Bank, whose licence also covers Britannia and the Smile online bank, said there had been ‘no increase in transactions’ from customers at its branches.

It said it was ‘disappointed’ by the downgrade, adding: ‘We have a strong funding profile and high levels of liquidity, which are significantly above the regulatory requirements.’

In a Tweet it also dismissed concerns that it could become the latest lender to require a bail-out. ‘We would like to reassure customers and members that we haven’t sought nor do we need government support.’

But the Co-op acknowledged that it has not set aside enough spare capital to cushion itself against future shocks.

The main threat is spiralling losses from reckless commercial property loans made by Britannia, the former building society that Co-op Bank took over in 2009.

The bank slumped to a £674million loss last year as losses from bad loans – mainly commercial property loans made by Britannia – soared to £351 million.

The Co-op is reported to need around £750million to plug the black hole in its finances.

Moody’s claimed the ‘bank faces the risk of further substantial losses in its non-core portfolio’.

It also raised the prospect of another taxpayer bail-out, adding that it may require ‘external support to maintain regulatory capital levels’.

Like other lenders, the Co-op is still in the dark about exactly how much it has to raise.

The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee revealed last month that UK lenders have a total shortfall of £25billion.

The Prudential Regulation Authority, the new banking watchdog, will tell individual lenders what their shortfall is in the coming weeks. 

Dan Plant from personal finance website MoneySavingExpert.com said: ‘For savers worried about safety, there’s one clear message – if you’ve got under £85,000  combined in accounts with  Co-op, Britannia and Smile, you’re fully protected by the  compensation scheme.

‘Anyone with big savings who uses these brands should check now they’re under the limit.’

Insiders at the Co-op stressed its problems are very different to those which caused the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007.  The North East lender’s downfall was sealed when nervous banks stopped lending to each other, starving it of vital funds. 

But the Co-op Bank could resort to tapping up parent company Co-operative Group, which owns a string of businesses. It has assets of £82billion, including almost £7billion which could be used to prop up the bank. Last night the Government and Lloyds came under fire for accepting the Co-op’s cut-price £750million offer to run 632 Lloyds branches.

State-backed Lloyds was ordered to sell these branches by the European Commission as a condition of receiving a £20billion bailout from UK taxpayers in 2008.

But the deal, which would have involved the transfer of 4.8million Lloyds customers to the Co-op, collapsed last month. The Co-op blamed the ‘worsened outlook for economic growth’ and ‘increasing regulatory requirements’.
