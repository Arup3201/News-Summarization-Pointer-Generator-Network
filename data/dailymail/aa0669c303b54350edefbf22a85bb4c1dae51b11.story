A Detroit family is being ripped apart after immigration officials gave a 40-year-old married mother 24 hours to leave the country despite having no criminal convictions, a husband who has lived here for decades and three U.S.-born children.

Cile Precetaj, who came to the States seeking asylum 13 years ago, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. today for a flight back to her native Albania, after receiving a letter from authorities Monday telling her to pack her bags.

However, in a desperate bid to buy time, she deliberately missed the deadline, and is now waiting at home, with her family around her, until authorities take her to jail where she will be held until another flight is organized.

Devastating: Cile Precetaj, pictured right, who came to the States seeking asylum 13 years ago, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday for a flight back to her native Albania

Tears: Precetaj, pictured with her three U.S.-born children Mikey, 11, right, Migena, 6, center, and Martina, 4, left, was told Monday that she had to leave

'There is a level of insanity in this
 case,' her New York-based immigration attorney Andrew Johnson told 
MailOnline as he fights against the clock to keep Precetaj with her 
husband and children. 'Someone is not doing what is ordinarily done. 
There is an abuse of power.'

Precetaj
 came to the U.S. through Canada in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in 
Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She 
immediately turned herself in and sought asylum. While here illegally, 
she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 
40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, Mikey, 11, Migena, 6 and 
Martina 4, all U.S. citizens.

Precetaj
 is the sole carer of her elderly mother-in-law, another U.S. citizen, 
whose toes were amputated and needs help eating, walking and washing.

But
 her case for political asylum was rejected after a judge said her 
testimony about fearing the prostitution trade lacked credibility. He 
said even if her concerns were warranted 'young, attractive women are 
not a social group for asylum.'

Packing up: Precetaj, pictured center with her kids, chose not to go to the airport and remained at home with her packed bags, waiting for authorities but they didn't come

Seeking asylum: Precetaj came to the U.S. through Canada in 2000 fearing that if she stayed in Albania she would be kidnapped and sold into prostitution. She immediately turned herself in and sought asylum

After losing her appeal, she was given a deportation order.

An estimated 500,000 people are 
living in the U.S. with a deportation order, however, U.S. Immigrations 
Customs and Enforcement only acts on a portion of cases and the Obama 
Administration specifically said targeting people with criminal 
convictions was the priority.

Precetaj
 has none. In fact, she's a glowing member of her community, described 
by friends and her children's teachers as a hard-working mother who pays
 her taxes and helps her kids with schoolwork, not to mention keeping 
her elderly mother-in-law out of a government-funded home.

'Detroit
 has gone off the map here,' Johnson said. 'They are doing something 
that has not been done around the country. This person probably has as 
many positive evaluations as you can, she has three children who are 
U.S. citizens and has been here for a long time. I'm just baffled.'

Settled in: While here, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, including Migena, 6, pictured

Precetaj
 became concerned about two weeks ago, when at her regular six-month 
check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a GPS ankle
 bracelet. But the mother-of-three was convinced ICE wouldn't deport a 
woman whose three kids are American-born.

'That is strange they put an ankle 
bracelet on a mom with three kids,' Johnson said, referring to the low 
risk of her fleeing. 'Then the day before her scheduled flight they said
 "You're flying out tomorrow, here's your information." They didn't want
 the bad press.

'I
 think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they 
understood how egregious this case is. It just doesn't make sense.'

Now, the authorities will be forced to collect Precetaj from her home and take her into custody. At midday Tuesday, she was pictured there, with her family surrounding her awaiting ICE officers.

Precetaj
 and her children were crying as they hugged by the Christmas tree, and 
the woman's mother-in-law was asking what would become of her if her 
daughter was sent home. Other relatives, including a cousin, were 
visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown 
into.

Hugs: Precetaj has not decided, if she is in fact deported, whether to take the kids, who have never been to Albania, with her

Review: The mother's case will be reviewed

'They will jail 
her for one to three weeks, however long it takes to organize another 
flight,' Johnson told MailOnline. 'Then border guards will drive her to 
the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she's a mass murderer 
or a terrorist going to Guantanamo.'

In the meantime, Johnson and the family are working desperately for someone in Washington D.C. to interject.

'We need somebody in the White House, connected to ICE, to say "stop this immediately. This is wrong." If someone in DC hears about this, that is our best chance. Her story just hasn't been heard.'

Understandably, Precetaj is beside herself, and is still trying to work out if she will take her children, who are enrolled in school and have never been to Albania, with her. Her husband works as a cook at restaurant in Detroit and said he can't afford to raise the children on his own.

'She is an emotional mess,' Johnson explained.

Deportation: Precetaj was informed Monday that she had to report at Deport's McNamara terminal at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday as per the above order

Empty: But the terminal, pictured, was empty at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, as the mother-of-three defied the order by staying home

'What she has been told by numerous people was that they don't deport women with three US citizen children and that is exactly what they're doing.

'She is crying all the time, trying to work out who she can take and who she can't. She's going back to Albania and that is not a good place to bring a 6-year-old girl, particularly.'

He added: 'It happened in one day, she has no idea what to do.'

Gojcevic told the Detroit Free Press Monday night the family was 'hoping for a miracle.'

'Let her stay with her children and raise them in a country that they know,' he said. 'She loves this country.'
