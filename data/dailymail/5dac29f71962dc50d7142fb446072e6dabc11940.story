Staff and patrons were in for a shock after spotting a severed pig's head on a stake left outside a fast food restaurant.

Michelle Louise stopped in for a cup of coffee at Coolalinga McDonald's, south-east of Darwin, after dropping her daughter off at work when they made a grisly discovery at about 7.45am on Monday.

Ms Louise told NT News that she had noticed a group of people standing around a post so she walked over to see what it was when she was confronted by the bizarre sight.

Staff and patrons were stunned to find a severed pig's head on a stake left outside a fast food restaurant 

'It was this pig's head, it was really strange,' she told NT News.

'I joked to my son that it looked like there was now pork on the menu.'

Ms Louise said she was stunned to see the head left near the new site where a local shopping centre will be built.

‘I don’t know how long it had been there, it obviously happened in the night,’ she said.

When Ms Louise returned to the fast food giant to pick her daughter up after work, the head had been removed.

'I know people like pigging around here but I have never seen something like this,' she added.

Northern Territory police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that the incident is currently being ‘looked at’ for possible leads.

‘We’re certainly looking into it to figure out how, why and who someone would put it there,’ the police spokesman said.
