Ally McCoist watched Rangers beat top-flight opposition for the first time in two years on Tuesday night — then vowed they are more than a match for any team in knockout competition.

Lewis Macleod’s 78th-minute deflected winner against Inverness secured Rangers’ seventh consecutive win of the season and set up a trip to Falkirk in the last 16 of the League Cup next midweek.

It also kept Rangers in the hunt for their first cup triumph since they defeated Celtic in the final in 2011, with McCoist insisting his team have no reason to fear anyone.

‘Yes, we got a break with the goal but it was a result we deserved,’ said McCoist, whose team last beat a Premiership side in September 2012 with a 2-0 win over Motherwell in the League Cup. ‘I don’t think anyone could grudge us the win. We were the team that looked most like scoring.

‘What does this win tell us about where Rangers are? What we’ve done tonight is put out a team that is joint top of the top division and hadn’t lost a game or a goal until Saturday.

‘What that shows us is that in a one-off cup game we are capable of playing against anyone.’

On a night when just 15,208 turned up at Ibrox, amid supporter discontent with the board, there was a small protest at the end when the Sons of Struth fans group held up a banner behind the directors box proclaiming: ‘Enough is enough, give us our club back’.

While admitting he would have preferred a larger crowd, McCoist was just delighted to please the supporters.

‘I am happy to make the fans smile, yes. I said before the game we are duty bound to train our energy on things we can have a bearing on — and we’ve sent the Rangers fans home with a smile tonight.

‘I’ve no doubt there were also thousands sitting round radios and watching televisions with a smile on their faces, too. That’s a very big part of our job and it makes us feel good.

‘I can understand it (the attendance). I want the stadium full, of course I do. I am the manager and the fuller the stadium the better. But I can understand what’s going on.

‘But I’m doing my level best not to get involved in it. I can’t have a bearing on that but I can have a bearing on picking teams and getting results like we did tonight.’

McCoist praised match-winner Macleod, 20, who put a serious viral infection behind him at the turn of the year to become a key member of the team.

‘Lewis is terrific,’ he said. ‘We asked him to contribute more goals and assists and that little bit of a killer instinct — and he’s certainly given us that.

‘He showed great maturity and intelligence to stay switched on tonight for his goal. When others were claiming for the handball — which I didn’t really think it was — he kept his wits about him with the ball in play and struck the winner.

‘He’s got a good head on young shoulders.

‘I’m not putting any pressure on him after the time he’s had but it’s just great to see him back and entertaining our fans. They clearly — and rightly — are taking him to their hearts.

‘How far can he go in the game? In the history of Rangers, we’ve had some great young players come through. I hope Lewis does as well as some of them.’
