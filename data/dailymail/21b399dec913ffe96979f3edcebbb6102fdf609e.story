Brazil kick-off this month's World Cup against Croatia on Thursday, with most of the best on show in South America. But who are the stars earning most money? Sportsmail takes a look at the top 10 highest-paid players - by weekly wage at club level - who will feature in Brazil.

Reported Weekly Wage: £300,000Age: 28Club: Manchester UnitedCountry: EnglandMajor Sponsors: Harper Collins, Nike, EA Sports, Coca-Cola

Earning 50p a second, Rooney’s new, terrifyingly profitable contract assures he takes first place above his fellow superstars. Striker for a Manchester United side that underperformed last season, he still managed to become the club’s third top scorer of all time, overtaking George Best and Ryan Giggs, and as a result, now has an enormous net worth estimated to be in excess of £60million.

Endorsements earn him a fair wedge, with lucrative deals including Nike and Electronic Arts, the computer gaming company which features Rooney on the front of its best-selling FIFA football games.

He also had his third book, ‘My Decade In The Premier League,’ published in 2012 as part of his deal with Harper Collins.  

All smiles: England talisman Wayne Rooney is on £300,000-a-week at Manchester United

Holding the key: Lionel Messi will attempt to win Argentina's first World Cup since 1986

Okay, we kind of cheated by putting Rooney first, because the £300,000 a week figure is before tax.

Messi’s contract, signed last year, sees him earn a reported £292,000 AFTER tax in Spain. (You can read about the different taxes in each country here).

He is often regarded as the best footballer in the world - although he lost the Ballon d’Or crown to Cristiano Ronaldo this season - so it is apt he is paid accordingly. His accolades, just like his salary, are certainly not in short supply.

He broke the 39-year record for most goals in a European club season in 2012 when he finished the season with 73 goals and has won the Ballon d’Or a whopping three times. He is also a three-time winner of FIFA Player of the Year and became the first player to score five goals in a Champions League match.

In addition to his gargantuan salary, Messi makes millions more every year from endorsements, the biggest of which is Adidas, who launched his 'icon signature' line in 2013.      

Reported Weekly Wage: £288,000Age: 29Club: Real MadridCountry: Portugal Major sponsors: Nike, Coca-Cola, Castrol, Konami, Motorola, Herbalife, KFC, Tag Heuer, Fly Emirates, Emporio Armani

Ronaldo is reported to earn £288,000 after tax, in a deal similar to his La Liga rival Messi. He is currently reported to be in contract extension talks with Real Madrid, so he could see himself rocketed to the highest paid footballer once again soon. Importantly, he also owns a 50-50 share of his image rights.

His popularity on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have translated into big bucks from sponsors like Nike, Castrol and Konami, all of which he promotes through his own social media accounts.

Not content with monopolising the advertising world, Ronaldo also launched himself into the fashion industry as the ‘spokesmodel’ for Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans in 2009.

In March, a 'Rich List' compiled by Goal.com was topped by Ronaldo, with an estimated net worth of around £122million.

With many an achievement to his name, including PFA Player of the Year and the Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year, it’s no wonder Van Persie left Arsenal to chase for club honours.

Born in Rotterdam, Van Persie is currently the all-time top scorer for Holland. He is also one of world football's top earners. He has been part of major commercial campaigns for huge corporate brands, including Nike, BT Sport and Pepsi, all of which have rendered a tidy sum for the Dutchman.

In the money: The Ivory Coast's Yaya Toure has had a very public spat with Manchester City recently

Reported Weekly Wage: £230,000Age: 31Club: Manchester CityCountry: Ivory CoastMajor Sponsors: Puma, Ford

With a four-year contract that pays him over £10million a year, there is no surprise that Touré is among the top earners on the pitch. The Ivorian midfielder has had a distinguished international career with 82 caps for the Ivory Coast, representing the team in their first appearance in a World Cup in 2006 and again in 2010. Touré has won the African Footballer of the Year for the last three consecutive years.

In addition to his rewarding salary, he also signed an endorsement deal with Puma that includes distributing the brand’s gear to underprivileged African children.

He is one of the only non-strikers on the list - but despite this, was third top scorer in the Premiership last season chipping in with 20 goals for Manchester City helping them win the title. His future at the club is in doubt however because of a falling-out over a birthday cake.

Multiple leg injuries have resulted in a bit of a stop-start career at Manchester City so far for the Argentine, nicknamed ‘Kun’.

However, this has not hindered his relationship with the club who, in May 2013, agreed to give him a contract extension and salary increase that not only keeps him with the club until 2017 but also makes him one of the highest paid football players in the world.

Reported Weekly Wage: £220,000Age: 27Club: LiverpoolCountry: Uruguay Major Sponsors: Adidas

Despite Suarez’s turbulent tenure with Liverpool, involving multiple suspensions and an attempted escape to Arsenal, he enhanced his reputation as a world-class footballer last season forming a deadly partnership with Englishman Daniel Sturridge and in turn, earns one of the highest salaries of the Premier League.

As Uruguay’s all-time leading goal scorer with 39 for the national team, Suarez commands the top wage at Liverpool after he was rewarded with a new contract in December.

He was seen as a national hero when he helped lead his country to a fourth place finish in the 2010 World Cup after blocking a goal bound header from Ghana in the quarter-final with his hands. He was sent off, but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to go through to the next round.

Nicknamed ‘Merlin’ for his wizard-like passing abilities, Silva signed a five-year contract to make up a reported £200,000 a week playing for Manchester City. Since joining the club, the Spanish midfielder has appeared in over 150 games in three seasons, winning the FA Cup, League Cup and Premier League.

He is famously described by his sponsor Adidas as a ‘new brand of player’ with surgical precision and a brain for strategy. Could he fire Spain to a second consecutive World Cup win?

Thinker: David Silva will provide Spain with the incisive sort of intelligent play they are renowned for

Main man: Chelsea's Eden Hazard will be the main spark for dark horses Belgium

Reported Weekly Wage: £185,000Age: 23Club: ChelseaCountry: BelgiumMajor sponsors: Nike

Currently regarded as one of the best midfielders of his generation, even compared to the likes of Zidane, it's not hard for Chelsea to rationalise spending a reported £185,000 a week on the Belgian. With rumours circling that Hazard is a target for Paris Saint-Germain, the Blues have said they are prepared to pay the big bucks to keep hold of him – so he could race up this list in the near future.

Although approached by Adidas, Hazard has remained loyal to his long-term sponsors Nike, with a renewed endorsement contract that is said to make him one of their leading football faces along with Ronaldo, Rooney, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Incredible! Fernando Torres might be struggling for goals for Chelsea and Spain but he makes the top 10

Despite his outrageously large salary, all that glitters is not gold - throughout his time at the club, Torres has been a disappointment for Chelsea with many a second-rate performance.

It's a far cry from the prolific period he spent at Liverpool, where he became the fastest player in the club's history to score 50 league goals, but something hasn't clicked since his £50million move to the West London club in 2011.

In spite of this, he has been capped over 100 times for his country and is Spain’s third-highest goalscorer of all time.

He also has a couple of high profile endorsement deals with Adidas and Pepsi, as well as a few domestic Spanish brands, boosting his income.
