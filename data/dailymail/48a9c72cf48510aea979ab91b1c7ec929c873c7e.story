Labour spending plans will mean tax rises for millions of families, David Cameron claimed today.

In a speech on the economy, the Prime Minister said the Ed Miliband's decision not to support Tory spending cuts left voters with a clear choice at the next election - more Government spending under Labour, but also higher taxes.

Mr Cameron said: 'If people are happy to be taxed more, fine. They can make their decision at the next election. But that is the consequence of Labour – and the British people need to know it.'

Prime Minister David Cameron, who will claim today that Labour's economic plan is a 'massive gamble' that would leave Britain vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 crisis

Last week, Mr Miliband sought last week to win back trust in Labour's ability to handle the nation's finances by setting out a 'tough and balanced' approach which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible'.

He said 2015 would be 'a fight for the soul of our country', between Conservatives bent on slashing public spending to 1930s levels for ideological reasons and a Labour Party offering a 'tough and balanced' approach which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible'.

Mr Miliband insisted a Labour government would  only borrow to invest in such things as infrastructure.

But Mr Cameron will warn that this will prevent the eradication of the £91billion budget deficit and mean higher taxes for all.

He said: 'When they say, as they do, that they don’t support our spending reductions, that they want to spend more - we all know what that means: higher taxes.

'There is simply no way around this. The money’s got to come from somewhere – and it’s going to come from you.

'So that is the choice between sticking to the plan or veering off it: lower taxes or higher taxes.'

He also warned there would be deeper cuts in the future to pay off the debts in the long term

Mr Cameron pointed to analysis by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies that says the plans would let Mr Miliband borrow up to £50billion a year.

The Tories have pledged to run a £23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament, letting ministers begin paying off the national debt.

Mr Cameron said that beneath the 'jargon' was a blueprint that would massively increase public borrowing and store up potential crises.

He said Labour's plans would involve increasing the Government's towering debts 'for ever' - leaving Britain vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 crisis.

Left unchecked, Labour's plans will increase the national debt by £500billion in two decades - equal to almost £30,000 for every tax-paying family - Mr Cameron added.

Ed Miliband said 2015 was 'a fight for the soul of our country' - between the Tories bent on slashing spending for ideological reasons and Labour which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible'

'At the height of the so-called boom years, far from running a surplus, Britain was running the biggest structural deficit in the G7. Then, in 2008, when the economic storms hit, we were completely exposed,' he warned.

'Our plan is about making sure that doesn't happen again. It's about saying that by 2018 we will be putting money aside so that if any crash or shock happens to our economy, we will be better prepared.

'And frankly, if we are not going to start putting money aside after seven years of continued economic growth, when will we be?'

Experts have warned that the scale of the squeeze required to meet the Chancellor's targets would mean spending cuts 'on a colossal scale'.

George Osborne wants Britain to run a £23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament

Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Vince Cable said they would 'destroy public services in this country in the way we know them' and accused the Tories of embarking on an extreme 'ideological' mission that would spell misery for voters.

But Mr Cameron insisted the Tory plans are 'sensible and reasonable' compared to the 'reckless' Labour strategy.

'Ed Miliband spoke about the deficit - and wrapped it all up in a lot of jargon.

'He claimed he would run 'a surplus on the current budget' and attacked our plans to 'balance the overall budget'. I want to peel back the jargon and tell you what this actually means.

'Ed Miliband is saying he will only balance part of the Government's budget, not the whole thing like we plan.

'And let's be clear what that means: Ed Miliband would never clear the overall, headline budget deficit. He would run a budget deficit, permanently adding to debt indefinitely. Every year. Forever.'

Treasury calculations suggested Labour's policy would result over 21 years in a £500 billion bigger debt than on Tory plans, he will say, £30,000 more debt for every taxpaying household in Britain.

'That is a great, black, ominous cloud on the horizon and if a real economic storm hit again, the fall-out would be felt by families up and down this country...

'Our plan is about fixing the roof when the sun is shining. The alternative is about taking a massive gamble with our future.'

Labour questioned why the Chancellor had not - as promised in the Autumn Statement - yet set out details of legislation enshrining in law a commitment to eliminate the deficit on day-to-day spending by Government departments by 2017-18.

The move was seen as a trap for Labour but shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said it was now 'a shambles'.

'In the Budget George Osborne was talking about a vote on balancing the overall budget. Then last month the Treasury tried to lay the ground for a big U-turn by briefing that the vote would only be on balancing the current budget, excluding capital investment.

'And now, after all the hype and promises that a new Charter would have been published over the last week, the Government has totally failed to publish anything. This is a total mess. As ever, these so-called Tory traps are backfiring on the Chancellor.

'George Osborne should spend less time playing silly political games and more time sorting out the economy and trying to make his sums add up.'
