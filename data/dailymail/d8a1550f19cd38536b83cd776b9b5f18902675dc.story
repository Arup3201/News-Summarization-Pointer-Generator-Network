Reeva Steenkamp’s family has categorically denied that the model was pregnant when Paralympian Oscar Pistorius shot and killed her.

The National Enquirer reported earlier this week that Steenkamp told the athlete that she was pregnant to placate him after he accused her of cheating on him.

But today family spokesman Mike Steenkamp denied the reports were true and said the cover girl's mother June would have known.

'The post mortem would have revealed if Reeva was pregnant and it did not reveal anything like this. Maybe it comes from the other side, to garner and build up some sort of support for Oscar,' Mr Steenkamp told Times Live.

Pregnant? A new report claims that Reeva Steenkamp, pictured left with Oscar Pistorius, had been murdered after revealing that she was pregnant

Memorial: Oscar Pistorius is at his uncle's home after being granted bail following his hearing and is planning to hold a memorial for his dead girlfriend

Pistorius
claims he killed Steenkamp accidentally, opening fire after mistaking her
for an intruder in his bathroom.But prosecutors say he intentionally shot 
her in cold blood after the couple had an argument.

The National Enquirer reported on Monday that the argument was sparked by the news that Pistorius was about to become a father.

A source close to investigation told the supermarket tabloid: 'Police believe the preg­nancy secret she revealed is what sent Pistorius over the edge and left her dead, with bullet wounds to the head, chest, pelvis and hand.'

The source added: 'Later that night, neighbors com­plained of shouting and fighting coming from the house.

'Police were called to in­vestigate, but it appeared to be just another lover’s spat, so nothing was done except to ask them to quiet down.'

No warning: Steenkamp is pictured outside Pistorius' home in her car hours before she was murdered

It's the latest lurid claim to hit 
the case, which has seen numerous sensational allegations in the wake of
Steenkamp's death. However, it remains unconfirmed in South Africa.

Pistorius, who had both of his legs amputated below the knee when he was just 11 months old, competed on a set of prosthetic blades, earning him the nickname 'blade runner.'

He has competed as a sprinter in each of the Paralympic Summer Games since 2004 until running alongside able-bodied athletes in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

But his days as a runner will be numbered if he's found guilty of Steenkamp's murder.

His family said on Tuesday that the runner held a private memorial service for Steenkamp at his Uncle Arnold's home in Pretoria, where he has been staying since he was freed on bail.

The runner's family has asked for privacy but confirmation of the memorial service came after a leak in the media, Sky News reported today.

A
statement by Pistorius' representatives said: 'This statement is 
released in response to a leak to the media regarding a planned private 
memorial service for Reeva Steenkamp.

'Oscar Pistorius, will hold a private memorial service for Reeva Steenkamp at the house of his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, tonight.

Oscar Pistorius claims he shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead by accident believing her to be an intruder at his home

'Oscar
specifically requested the memorial service as he continues to grieve 
and remains in deep mourning for the loss of his partner Reeva.

'Since
it is such a sensitive issue, Oscar has asked for a private service 
with people who share his loss, including his family members who knew 
and loved Reeva as one of their own.

'The
Pistorius family would like to make a personal request to the media, to
please respect their privacy at their home in Pretoria tonight.'

Also on Tuesday, it was revealed that Desmond Nair, chief magistrate of the Pretoria Magistrate's Court who presided over the bail hearing, is in mourning after it is believed one of his relatives killed herself and her children.

The bodies of a woman and her two 
sons were found on Sunday evening at their Johannesburg home by her 
ex-husband, police warrant officer Balan Muthan said.

Authorities suspect the woman administered a substance that killed her children, and took her own life by ingesting it as well.

'I can confirm the deceased is my first cousin,' Nair said.

The
woman's brother, Vishal Maharaj, identified her as Anusha Maharaj. 
Police said Maharaj was her family name before she married. South 
African media identified her as Anusha Mooljee.

Muthan
said police suspect 'she took her own life by ingesting a substance 
that killed her,' and that she 'most probably' gave the same substance 
to her children.

Autopsies were conducted on Monday and 
toxicologists were analyzing the substance believed to have killed the 
three family members.

Suicide
notes were found and a murder investigation was underway, Muthan said. 
He said copies of the notes were admitted as evidence in the probe and 
declined to comment on the contents.

Eyewitness
News, a South African media outlet, said the boys who died were 12 and 
17 years old and cited neighbor Claire Osment as saying she rushed 
outside after hearing screams coming from the townhouse where they 
lived.

Pretoria chief magistrate Desmond Nair, who presided over the Pistorius bail hearing in Pretoria, South Africa, is in private mourning, reports said

'We asked what happened. The dad just said, "She has killed my boys." He was just crying,' Eyewitness News quoted her as saying.

'He couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe that his sons are gone.'

Nair, 44, has presided over a number 
of high-profile cases, including the 2008 conviction on fraud charges of
Sydney Maree, a South African who took American citizenship and became a
track star in the United States.

He
also presided over a 2011 plea agreement in which rugby player Bees 
Roux received a five-year suspended prison sentence for the beating 
death of a policeman; and inquiries into alleged misconduct by 
magistrates around South Africa.

On
Friday, Nair delivered a lengthy discourse on why he was granting bail 
to Pistorius, including an assertion that prosecutors had not argued 
persuasively that the Paralympian was a flight risk.

Nair
criticized shortcomings in the state's investigation, but he also said 
aspects of Pistorius' account of what happened were not convincing.

Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

The murder-suicide would be the the latest in a series of twists that have come along with the Pistorius trial.

Last
week, the chief investigator in the case against Pistorius, Hilton 
Botha, was removed from the inquiry after it was revealed that attempted
murder charges against him had been reinstated in early February.

The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus.

In
another surprise, a lawyer for the Pistorius family said Sunday that 
Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a charge of unlawful, negligent killing for
a 2008 road death.

That charge had also been dropped and later 
reinstated.
