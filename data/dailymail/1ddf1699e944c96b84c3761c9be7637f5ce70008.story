Blake Bortles is expected to be one of the hottest properties at the NFL draft in May but it seems coaches are far more interested in hearing about his model girlfriend Lindsey Duke.

The University of Central Florida's star quarterback faced a series of 'awkward' questions at the Indianapolis scouting combine about his stunning blonde partner.

Speaking on The Dan Patrick Show, the 22-year-old NFL-bound quarterback revealed one coach even asked him if Duke would be available for dinner.

'It was kind of some awkward [questions],' said Bortles.

'You know, "If we come to town, will she be there for dinner?" and stuff like that.'

While
 Bortles is expected to be one of the top three quarterbacks picked in 
May, Daisy has a rapidly growing profile of her own having already appeared on at least one magazine cover.

Hot prospects: Bortles is rumored to be a top 10 pick for May's NFL draft despite being a junior

Despite his talent, a Google search of the relatively under-the-radar Bortles retrieves only about 225,000 results

Social butterfly: Duke has a habit of frequently posting pictures of herself and her friends in bikinis to Instagram and Twitter, helping pave her path to success

She also regularly shares photos of the couple arm-in-arm with her 33,000 Instagram followers as well as more racy bikini pictures with her.

And Bortles said
 he felt the coaches may have identified his girlfriend's 
rapidly-growing fame as a potential weakness so made the comments 'to 
see how I reacted to it'.

Bortles
 went on: '[The teams] knew [about my girlfriend] going into the 
meeting. I think that was kinda the angle, how I would react to it.'

Duke's popularity places her in league with Katherine Webb, the former Miss Alabama and girlfriend of 2013 draft favorite A.J. McCarron who rose to fame after being spotted in the stands by an ESPN cameraman

Off the field as well as on, Bortles doesn't seem particulary fazed by his girlfriend's popularity.

'Apparently,
 she is more of a household name than I am,' Bortles told ESPN. 'Sheâ€™s 
more famous than me and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that.'

He's had time to get used to her appeal.
 They've been a couple since high school, where they attended prom 
together, and then attended the same university.

While the talented athlete gets a not so shabby 225,000 results when searched on Google, his buxom girlfriend's name returns over 6 million.

ESPN reporter Gene Wojciechowski recently told Bortles' coach George O'Leary about the discrepancy in the couple's internet fame.

'I
 would hope as a head coach that the numbers would be reversed,' O'Leary
 said, 'but obviously you havenâ€™t seen his girlfriend. She deserves six 
million Googles.' 

Duke
 is set to graduate this year, which has many wondering if she'll be 
greeted with the same offers of modeling and television show gigs as the
 most beloved college football girlfriend of 2013 Katherine Webb.

Webb, who was Miss Alabama 2012, was basically spotted in the stands by ESPN this time last year as she cheered on her boyfriend of one month A.J. McCarron.

The promising Alabama quarterback's spotlight quickly swung to Webb, who has since appeared in television commercials, a reality televsion series, and on the computer screens of a huge chunk of the American male populace.

While Webb's rise to fame came quickly and almost out of nowhere, she and Duke both have another football beauty forebearer to thank for their success.

In 2012, the breakout female star of the NFL draft was Lauren Tannehill.

Featured on ESPN's draft coverage that year, the aspiring model and wife of the Miami Dolphin's pick Ryan Tannehill was a major hit, setting social networking sites abuzz with complimentary tweets.

In the first ten minutes after Texas A&M quarterback Tannehill was picked with the eighth overall selection, the cardiology assistant began trending on Twitter and picked up 3,000 followers overnight, a 350 percent increase on the day before.
