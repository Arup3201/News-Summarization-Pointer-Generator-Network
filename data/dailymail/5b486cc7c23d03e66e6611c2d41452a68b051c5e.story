An 18-year-old Chicago high school student gave birth to a baby boy last Saturday then allegedly put him outside in a Walmart plastic bag to kill him 'because he looked like her ex-boyfriend and she was afraid her current boyfriend would leave her.'

Ana Rosa Mora faces a first degree murder charge for allegedly killing her baby and later admitted to her actions after school employees and police became suspicious.

The child was discovered along a gangway in North Hamlin last weekend in a plastic bag with its umbilical cord and placenta.

Ana Rosa Mora, 18, allegedly murdered her newborn by putting it in a plastic bag and leaving it outside to die

The boy's body was discovered in the alley between two buildings in the 2700 block of North Hamlin Avenue last Saturday morning

The Chicago Tribune reports that staff members at Kelvyn Park High School where Mora was a student asked her about her recent birth and so she showed them a photograph on her ipad claiming it was her baby girl.

Police later discovered the photograph was downloaded from the internet.

Others became suspicious when Mora brought up the baby found near her home and asked if people would test for her DNA and the DNA of the baby, said prosecutors.

When a police officer congratulated Mora on her child and asked her how old it was she said 'six months' in front of school staff who knew that she was lying.

Assistant State Attorney Glen Runk said that Mora later admitted to police that she placed the baby in a bag in the gangway near her home at the 2700 block of North Hamlin Avenue.

The Cook County Medical examiner's office determined that the baby who was found in a plastic bag with placenta and umbilical cord, was born alive and was killed by asphyxia.

Judge Laura Marie Sullivan ordered in court on Saturday that that Mora be held on $500,000 bail.

Mora's defense said that she was a good student and planned to attend college in the fall.
