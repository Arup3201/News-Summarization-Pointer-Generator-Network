Middle-aged people who don’t get enough exposure to sunshine are twice as likely to die earlier, research warns.

Around half of all adults in the UK are thought to have some degree of vitamin D deficiency.

But scientists from the University of California’s San Diego School of Medicine found that people with an average age of 55 who had lower blood levels of vitamin D were twice as likely to die prematurely as those with higher levels.

Vitamin D is made by the body under the skin when it is exposed to sunlight. A deficiency can cause problems when there is not enough of the vitamin to properly absorb the required levels of calcium and phosphate.

Mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone pain and weakening of the bones – osteoporosis – which increases the risk of fractures.

More severe levels of deficiency can lead to the development of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.

And a 2010 British Medical Journal clinical review found that vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of developing heart disease, bowel and breast cancer, multiple sclerosis and diabetes.

Professor Cedric Garland said: 'Three years ago, the Institute of Medicine concluded that having a too-low blood level of vitamin D was hazardous.

'This study supports that conclusion, but goes one step further.

'The 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) blood level cutoff assumed from the IOM report was based solely on the association of low vitamin D with risk of bone disease.

'This new finding is based on the association of low vitamin D with risk of premature death from all causes, not just bone diseases.”

Prof Garland said the blood level amount of vitamin D associated with about half of the death rate was 30 ng/ml.

Two-thirds of the U.S. population has an estimated blood vitamin D level below 30 ng/ml.

Prof Heather Hofflich added: 'This study should give the medical community and public substantial reassurance that vitamin D is safe when used in appropriate doses up to 4,000 International Units (IU) per day.

'However, it’s always wise to consult your physician when changing your intake of vitamin D and to have your blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D checked annually.

'Daily intakes above 4,000 IU per day may be appropriate for some patients under medical supervision.'

The study published in the American Journal of Public Health reported the average age when the blood was drawn was 55 years with the average length of follow-up was nine years.

It involved 566,583 people from 14 countries.
