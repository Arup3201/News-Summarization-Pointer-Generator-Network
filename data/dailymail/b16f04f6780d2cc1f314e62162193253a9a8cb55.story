Dead: Arturo Diaz, 37, was executed yesterday in Hunstville, Texas, for murder

A murderer who was executed by lethal injection yesterday said that his fate should serve as a warning to stop people taking drugs.

Arturo Diaz, 37, died in Hunstville prison, Texas, after being injected with pentobarbital as punishment for killing a young man in 1999.

His death was witnessed by his mother and grandmother, as well as relatives of Michael Nichols, whom Diaz murdered.

Before he received his injection, Diaz said he hoped his death 'serves as an example for some youngsters... Think about it before you do drugs'.

He also turned to Forrest Nichols, Michael's father, and said: 'I hope this can bring some relief for you and your family'.

He had previously smiled and blown a kiss to his watching relatives, telling them in Spanish 'I am with God'.

After the injections Diaz took several deep breaths, started snoring, and stopped moving in less than a minute.

Mr Nichols described the execution as 'way too easy'.

Diaz, from the small town of Las Milpas, killed Michael Nichols, then 25, in his apartment in the nearby town of McAllen.

He later confessed to being drunk and on drugs during the attack. Evidence suggested that he had tried to steal Mr Nichols's pickup truck as well, but could not get out of a locked gate in the apartment complex.

Execution: Diaz was given a lethal injection of pentobarbital strapped to this stretcher in the death chamber in Hunstville, Texas

His shoeprint was found on the gate's keypad and DNA evidence was also found on a beer bottle in the apartment.

He was also convicted of attempted murder and aggravated robbery. He later confessed to another murder in which he stamped on the victim's face and hit the victim's head with a hammer.

While in prison Diaz sexually assaulted a fellow inmate, for which he was given a further jail term of 94 years.

Failed appeal: Lawyers for Diaz had tried to mount a last-ditch appeal against his execution with the Supreme Court, pictured, but it was unsuccessful

Lawyers for Diaz mounted a last-ditch appeal against his execution at the Supreme court, arguing he had been given inadequate legal help during the initial trial, but were unsuccessful.

Cregg Thompson, lead prosecutor in Diax's trial, said at the execution: 'You
know it's going to take some time for all the appeals and everything to
go through.

'But when you
say 14 years, that sounds like an awful long time.'
