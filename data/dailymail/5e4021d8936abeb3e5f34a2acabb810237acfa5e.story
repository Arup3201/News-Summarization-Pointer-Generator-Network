Suspect: Brenda Stokes Wilson is accused of slashing a Bellagio blackjack dealer and is suspected of kidnapping and slaying 10-year-old Jade Morris

The weeklong search for a Las Vegas girl ended Friday afternoon when officials confirmed that a small body found in an undeveloped housing tract belonged to the missing child.

The Clark County coroner's office said a body discovered Thursday belongs to 10-year-old Jade Morris, who police had been searching for since Christmas Day.

She died of multiple stab wounds, the coroner's office said.

Blood was found inside a car borrowed by a Las Vegas card dealer last seen with a missing 10-year-old girl and later arrested in the razor blade slashing of a co-worker, a prosecutor said Friday.

Brenda Stokes Wilson was identified in court Friday as the prime suspect in the slaying, although prosecutor Robert Daskas told a judge that authorities haven't positively identified the girl found dead Thursday in an undeveloped housing tract in North Las Vegas.

‘It's no secret the defendant is the suspect in the murder of 10-year-old Jade Morris,’ Daskas said as he convinced Senior Clark County District Court Judge Joseph Bonaventure to increase Wilson's bail from $60,000 to $600,000 pending the filing of kidnapping and murder charges.

Daskas said a weapon was used in the slaying, but he didn't elaborate.

'As soon as we get all the evidence 
in that we need, we'll book her on the murder charges,' Las Vegas police
homicide Capt. Chris Jones said.

Jones called the slaying 'unfathomable.'

'Even having our jobs, we still can't
wrap our heads around this,' he said. 'A lot of people think that just 
because of our positions we can understand it, but we can't.'

The girl was last seen by her family December 21, when Wilson picked her up to go Christmas shopping. She never returned.

Wilson,
50, was arrested later that night after she was wrestled to the ground 
with razors in each hand following a face-slashing attack on a female 
co-worker, Joyce Rhone, at the Bellagio resort.

Wilson
has been jailed on felony battery with a weapon, burglary and mayhem 
charges that could get her decades in prison. Police said she has 
offered no help in the search for the missing girl.

Murder and kidnapping charges could get her life in prison without parole or the death penalty.Wilson
stood in court flanked by eight police officers as her lawyer, Tony 
Liker, clutching a Bible and a copy of the charging documents, asked the
judge to postpone arraignment until Wednesday to give him time to meet 
with Wilson.

Police went 
public with the search for Jade Morris on Christmas Day, and the case 
received increasing attention after the relationship between the girl 
and Wilson became known.

Clark
County District Attorney Steve Wolfson watched the proceedings in court
Friday and called the case important for the community.

Wilson, who had been identified by police and prosecutors as Brenda Stokes, told the judge Friday that her full name was Brenda Stokes Wilson.

She used to date the missing girl's father, Philip Morris, and had a long and trusted relationship with Jade Morris, according to the missing girl's grandfather, Philip Tucker.

Philip Morris was removed from court Wednesday by armed court officers after shouting questions about his daughter's whereabouts to Wilson. He did not attend Friday's hearing.

Tucker said Philip Morris lived in Billings, Montana, and worked at a Flying J truck stop for more than a year. He would stay with Wilson when he visited Las Vegas, Tucker said.

Tucker said Rhone was Wilson's best friend and also knew Philip Morris.

Authorities have not disclosed a motive for the slaying. But Tucker said Wilson appeared to believe that Rhone and Philip Morris had become romantically involved. Tucker said he didn't know if Wilson's jealousy was well-founded.

'But whatever was going on with them didn't concern Jade,' Tucker said. 'How do you take a kid who loves you so much and hurt her?'

Jade Morris has been missing for a week after family friend Brenda Stokes offered to take her Christmas shopping. The pair never returned.

That night Stokes allegedly slashed a co-worker in the face with razor blade at the famed Bellagio resort on the Las Vegas strip.

Jade's family last saw her at about 5pm on December 21, when Stokes picked her up for a shopping outing, police said.

Police said Stokes was a trusted friend of the girl's father, and family members have told reporters that the two dated for several years.

Stokes was arrested later that night after she was accused of slashing her co-worker.

Stokes, 50, is now in jail, and Capt. Jones said she has not cooperated in the investigation of the girl's whereabouts. She even denied collecting the girl from her home.

A passer-by called 911 about noon Thursday, and North Las Vegas police found a girl's body in brush near palm trees in a small traffic circle near Dorrell Lane and North Fifth Street.

The location is a short distance from the northern 215 Beltway and about 10 miles from the downtown Las Vegas outlet mall off Interstate 15 where Stokes was to have taken the girl shopping.

Attempts to reach family members have been unsuccessful.

Stokes had picked up the girl to take her shopping and two hours later returned to another friend the red 2007 Saab sedan that she borrowed for the trip, Capt Jones said.

Daskas said police have the vehicle and are testing blood found on the driver's door and steering wheel to see if it matches Jade Morris. Stokes later got a ride with a friend to the Bellagio, police said.

Later, Stokes got a lift with a friend to the luxury hotel famed for its elaborate fountain displays, where she was arrested after authorities say she attacked a female co-worker, Joyce Rhone, with a razor in each hand as Rhone dealt blackjack about 9:30 p.m.

Rhone, 44, was hospitalized with deep cuts on her face, including one from her ear to the edge of her mouth. A police arrest report said Rhone also had several smaller cuts around her right eye.

The arrest report says casino video shows Stokes attacking Rhone before a casino patron and security officers intervene.

Officer Marcus Martin said the video is evidence that may be shown by prosecutors in court but will not be made public by police.

Police said Stokes later told investigators that she attacked Rhone over harassing phone calls and an unspecified betrayal that ended their seven-year friendship.

The slashing attack is said to have happened at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas strip. The luxury hotel is famed for its elaborate fountain displays, pictured

Stokes also told police she visited her doctor last week, seeking to be admitted to a hospital 'due to feeling like she wanted to hurt someone'.

When the family heard that Stokes had been arrested in a vicious knife attack on a fellow card dealer on the casino floor of the Bellagio, they grew concerned for their daughter's well-being.

The girl's father, Philip Morris, who is reportedly engaged to Stokes, had said just days ago he was sure Jade was still alive.

It is unknown how many of the Bellagio's 4,000 guests saw the fight, which occurred in the crowded casino at around 9.45pm, but it came just a week after many witnessed a murder-suicide in a busy hotel lobby on the Las Vegas strip.
