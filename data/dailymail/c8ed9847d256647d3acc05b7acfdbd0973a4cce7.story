Widely considered one of the greatest television shows ever, HBO’s The Wire is currently celebrating 12 years since it was first shown with a marathon run of fully-remastered high-definition episodes.

Over five series, the show explored the wide-ranging impact of the war on drugs on the crack-infested streets of Baltimore, Maryland.

Written by David Simon, a former police reporter for The Baltimore Sun, the show was praised for its gritty realism and much of it was filmed on location around some of the roughest parts of the city.

Though it never won an Emmy, The Wire has been referred to across the critical board as the greatest television series of all time, only recently rivaled by AMC’s Breaking Bad

City mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake recently told a story of how former Republican presidential nominee John McCain grabbed the hand about a year ago and asked if things were any better in Baltimore 'since The Wire?', reports the Baltimore Business Journal.

'Anecdotally, it still resonates with people as a true and accurate and unfortunately complete picture of Baltimore,' she said last month while speaking before Johns Hopkins University students as one in a series of guest lecturers in a class called 'Baltimore and The Wire.' 

'The show's popularity was based on showing all that was wrong in Baltimore.'

She maintains that much has changed over the past 12 years to improve Baltimore by reducing crime and urban blight, yet a collection of photos recently taken by Baltimore Sun crime reporter Justin Fenton appears to reveal that not much has changed - at least on the surface. 

He recently decided to take photos at some of the series most famous locations thus offering a then-and-now take.

'In honor of this #TheWireMarathon, tell me a filming location you'd like to see present day, I'll take a pic on my lunch break,' he tweeted on December 26.

Though it never won an Emmy, The Wire has been referred to across the critical board as the greatest television series of all time, only recently rivaled by AMC’s Breaking Bad.

Each season introduced a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they were: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media.

It also launched the careers of actors including Idris Elba, Dominic West, Michael B. Jordan and Michael K. Williams.

The series began its marathon at midnight on December 26 on HBO Signature and will finish on New Years Eve.
