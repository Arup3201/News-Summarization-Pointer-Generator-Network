Retired Germany keeper Tim Wiese made his professional wrestling debut on Saturday when the 32-year-old climbed into the ring at the WWE Live show in Frankfurt.

Wiese, who took up body building after being released by the Bundesliga side Hoffenheim in January, caught the eye of the sport and entertainment hybrid's top brass.

And Wiese, capped six times by Germany, was introduced to wrestling fans at the Festhalle Frankfurt on Saturday.

Wiese cut an imposing figure with his 6ft 3in frame now boasting the muscle mass to more than match the likes of current superstars John Cena and Brock Lesner.

‘I got an official request from the WWE,' he told Bild in September.

‘It’s for a commitment from me to become a pro wrestler. I’ll listen to everything on it’s own merits.

‘Why should I say no? Wrestling is very popular especially in the United States. I will discuss the offer in the next few weeks with my agent. I am not scared.’

Before Wiese could join the upper echelons of the WWE, it's been said he would need a year's training to get up to speed with their risky manouvres and showmanship.

Wiese spent the majority of his football career at Werder Bremen (194 appearances), where he played in the Champions League, after stints at Fortuna Koln and Kaiserslautern, and was part of Germany's 2010 World Cup squad.

He played just 10 times for Hoffenheim between 2012 and 2014.
