Celebrities, politicians, even members of the royal family - it seems that very few in the public eye are able to resist the temptation of snapping a selfie.

Now an artist has used his photoshop skills to imagine what icons of the past would have looked like taking pictures of themselves.

The artist, known by the alias Pixel Fairy, created the cheeky images of late celebrities, including Margaret Thatcher, Muhammad Ali and John Lennon, who are all captured posing, mobile phone in hand.

Blonde bombshell: The artist imagines how picture-perfect Marilyn Monroe would have looked snapping herself - decades before selfies took over the internet

Looking good: The artist behind the images, who goes by the name Pixel Fairy, said that this image former president John F Kennedy was among the easiest to do

The photo-retouching student, who 
undertook the project as a fun way to practise his skills for his 
university course, said that it has been such a success he has already 
had requests for prints.

He added that the most difficult part was finding the right pictures to mesh together in order to create a believable composite. The artist said: 'It’s difficult to find the right pictures to mash together, that takes up the most time.

'You find that the most famous people like Marilyn Monroe and JFK are the easiest ones to find the right pictures for because they have been photographed so many times.'

The British artist said that he did the project for fun and to practise his skills for his university course.

'I have no problem with selfies, I take a few myself from time to time. But I do find it bizarre how some celebrities and ordinary people get really obsessed with taking them.

Too cool for selfies: Martial arts legend Bruce Lee, pictured left, and John Lennon, right, are among the icons least likely to have been part of the craze, said the artist

Look at me! Boxing legend Muhammad Ali pulls a funny face for this selfie moment imagined by the Pixel Fairy. The artist said he found celebrity selfie culture 'bizarre'

'You couldn’t really see John Lennon or Bruce Lee getting selfie obsessed but maybe Audrey Hepburn and Freddie Mercury would have a few on their Instagram accounts!'

Other well-known figures included in the work are Indian civil rights leader, Mahatma Gandhi and German physicist, Albert Einstein.

The imagery whizz-kid said he’s had a great reaction to his work and plans to embark on further projects.

'It really did start off as a bit of fun and practice for my course but I’m really pleased with the results. I’ve already had people asking me for prints!'
