Armchair viewers are set for a TV bonanza next season after Hibs’ relegation added further spice to the Championship.

The Easter Road club’s humiliating defeat on penalties to Hamilton confirmed they will fight it out with Hearts and Rangers in the second tier for the one automatic promotion place on offer.

And, in light of Sunday’s drama, Sportsmail understands that several TV companies are now vying for the right to screen additional matches from what promises to be Scotland’s most competitive division.

Dejected: Hibernian were relegated after the club's heartbreaking play-off defeat to Hamilton

As things stand, Sky are in line to screen five Rangers games next term with BT Sport contracted to show 10 matches featuring the Ibrox club.

However, with the added interest from the two capital clubs now confirmed, it’s believed BBC Alba have already kicked off talks about the prospect of showing 16 further matches – not involving Rangers.

If that deal is rubberstamped, Alba would utilise the Friday night slot already dusted down by their satellite rivals as well as showing games on weekends both live and on delayed transmission.

That proposed deal would restrict the broadcaster to just two games per ground.

Keen to maximise revenue streams however, the SPFL have left the door open for Sky and BT Sport to come in and possibly extend their coverage of the second tier.

That could lead to a bun-fight between the three companies but, regardless of who wins the day, it seems certain that over 30 second tier matches will be beamed into living rooms in 2014-15.

On Monday night an SPFL spokesman said: 'We have regular conversations with our broadcast partners which are commercially confidential – we expect to announce the broadcasting arrangements for season 2014/15 in conjunction with them in the coming weeks.'

The lower league deals were first thrashed out when Rangers were exiled in the bottom tier in 2012 – initially with Sky and ESPN – but the fact three giant of the Scottish game are now in the Championship is forcing a rethink.

Last season Alba showed three live games and a further 35 on delayed transmission.
