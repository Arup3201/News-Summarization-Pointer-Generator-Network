A nurse who blew the whistle on one of the worst NHS scandals is to draw up compulsory training for all staff on how to raise the alarm on neglect, patient safety and high death rates.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce that Helene Donnelly, who worked in A&E at the notorious Stafford Hospital, is to be brought in as a senior adviser to ensure NHS staff can bring any concerns to light.

Mr Hunt will say that raising the alarm about poor care will be part of mandatory training.

He argues that creating a culture of ‘compassion, openness and transparency’ across the National Health Service is vital to prevent a repeat of the scandal at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, in which as many as 1,200 patients died from neglect.

Between 2004 and 2008, Mrs Donnelly raised nearly 100 formal complaints about treatment of patients at Stafford Hospital until, in frustration at being ignored by managers, she turned whistleblower.

She became a key witness at the subsequent public inquiry which was damning of the neglect, indignity and shoddy care that was endured by patients.

Mrs Donnelly said: ‘There has been much talk, but now is the time for action.

‘We must truly empower and support all NHS staff to raise concerns, and part of this is about ensuring they know how to do so and what to do if their concerns are ignored.

‘That’s why I’m delighted to be working on new mandatory training about whistleblowing, so that all staff will know what to do if they see care slip below the high standards we would all expect.’

The Health Secretary will also announce a plan to reduce ‘avoidable harm’ in the NHS by half over the next three years.

As many as one in five patients in some hospitals suffer from problems such as bed sores, falls, blood clots or the wrong medicines being administered.

Mr Hunt says that halving the incidence of avoidable harm could save up to 6,000 lives over the next three years.

He will confirm the introduction of a new ‘duty of candour’ – meaning that NHS organisations must notify the patient about incidents where ‘significant harm’ has occurred and provide an apology.

‘Speaking out should never be confused with a lack of commitment to NHS values or “running down the NHS”,’ he will say. ‘The highest form of commitment to our NHS is surely the courage to speak out against the system when the system gets it wrong.

‘We need to equip staff with the skills and confidence to speak up.

‘It is my ambition that the NHS should become the safest healthcare system anywhere in the world.

‘I want the tragic events of Mid Staffs to become a turning point in the creation of a more open, compassionate and transparent culture within the NHS.’

Mrs Donnelly became a key witness at the subsequent public inquiry which was damning of the neglect, indignity and shoddy care that was endured by patients and led to the shut down of the trust

Despite Government attempts to encourage more staff to raise concerns, MPs heard this week that just over half of NHS employees would feel confident to speak out regarding abuse.

Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said there was still a ‘culture of fear’ across the public sector against raising the alarm.

She added that it was only thanks to a whistleblower that it emerged that private firm Serco was fiddling figures for its out-of-hours GP service in Cornwall, and yet the firm had ‘rifled’ through staff lockers to try to find the person who had leaked the information.

Charlie Massey, a senior Department of Health official, said: ‘We have a huge amount to do in getting into a position where staff feel confident that actions will be taken as a result of speaking up.’

Mr Hunt, who is in America, will announce the new measures to empower NHS staff in a speech at the Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle, which has adopted strict measures to improve the quality of care that have seen it become one of the safest for patients in the world.
