Stepping up to a cashpoint, the bespectacled Parisian initially has no idea he is being watched.

Within a few seconds however, a Roma girl who has watched his every move begins to try and take his money.

She is supported by at least two other men – one creating a distraction on the other side of the man, and another sitting on the floor begging as he keeps an eye out for police.

Unseen in this set of pictures, which were taken last week, are other members of a gang who prey on the crowds and confusion of the French capital.

This time a tussle breaks out as the man sees what is happening and starts shouting at the girl.

She makes one last lunge for his cash, before running off with one of her accomplices.

Cashpoint theft is just one of many crimes that the Paris authorities blame on Roma – and one which is increasing all the time.

‘There are so many Roma working on scams like this that it is almost impossible for us to do anything about it,’ said a Paris police source.

‘They have look-outs everywhere, and use minors to do most of the stealing. If we do manage to catch the teenagers, then we have to let them go because of their age.’
