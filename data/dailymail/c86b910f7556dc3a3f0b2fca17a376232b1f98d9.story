Chelsea have opened discussions about bringing Didier Drogba back to Stamford Bridge.

Jose
 Mourinho wants to sign the 36-year-old as a second striker and will 
give him coaching responsibilities to develop his role at the club.

Drogba is an iconic figure at Chelsea and Mourinho hopes his presence will give the club extra impetus ahead of the news season.

Mourinho
 wants an extra striker with the departure of Samuel Eto'o while Demba 
Ba and Romelu Lukaku are expected to leave even if only on temporary 
deals. Fernando Torres is keen to stay despite interest from Inter 
Milan.

Qatari clubs are willing to offer greater money with salaries being discussed of around Â£3million a season after tax but the idea of a return to Chelsea is something both parties wish to look at.

Mourinho has great affection for Drogba and knows he could have great influence on a squad that is changing this summer. He declared prior to the Champions League tie with Galatasaray in March that Drogba could return and is keen to fulfil that wish.

Drogba won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and the Champions League while at Chelsea and Mourinho wants to use that experience to good effect with his new additions.

Return? Drogba was Chelsea's hero in the 2012 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich
