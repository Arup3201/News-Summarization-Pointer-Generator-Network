A female passenger was removed from a U.S. Airways flight on Sunday after screaming abusive language and then lashing out at police who came to take her off the plane.

Lindsay Capri Bien-aime, 22, was on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte when a row with flight attendants escalated after she did not follow instructions to turn off her cellphone.

Bien-aime was caught on another passenger's cellphone as she screamed curses at staff and fellow passengers.

Trouble: Lindsay Capri Bien-aime, 22, was on a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte when a row with flight attendants escalated

Violent: Officers were forced to restrain the woman once she began lashing out

Three police officers came on to the plane to escort the 22-year-old back to the terminal.

On the video, which was posted on YouTube, a deputy can be heard saying: 'You can get off the plane or you can get off the plane and go to jail.'

But despite repeated warnings Bien-aime refuses to budge saying: 'You don't want to make this worse right here' and 'you better not touch me.'

When another pasenger tried to intervene she swears at them before complaining: 'This is bullsh**, I'm gonna hold up the whole plane, Someone gotta tell me something.'

Reason: The officers tried to talk the woman into calming down but she hurled abusive language

Delays: Officers tried reasoning with the passenger before she had to be restrained and taken off the plane

Eventually a flight attendant comes 
up to her seat and explained that the reason she is being ejected is 
because she had ignored requests to stop talking on her phone. But she 
still refuses to go.

Bien-aime repeatedly says that she has not caused any problems and warns officers 'not to touch her' before lashing out.

One officer was kicked, another 
elbowed in the head and the third deputy was scratched as they tried to 
remove the violent passenger.Â 

The
U.S. Airways flight was delayed for 45 minutes because of the incident.
Bien-aime was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer.

A
U.S. Airways spokesman confirmed to MailOnline that there had been a 
passenger disturbance on the flight but had no further comment.
