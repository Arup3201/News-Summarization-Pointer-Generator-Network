Have you ever dreamed of enjoying the glamorous life of a football superstar?

The Premier League lifestyle is now within reach for those with £13,500 a month to spare, after striker Mario Balotelli gave notice on his plush Cheshire mansion.

The 22-year-old Manchester City star is vacating the four bedroom property in the WAGs' mecca of Alderley Edge, which boasts a heated indoor swimming pool, wine cellar, private cinema and even an astro turf putting green for perfecting those golf strokes.

Mario's mansion: Balotelli has given notice on the Lodge, situated in the WAGs' paradise of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, which is now available to rent for £13,495 a month

The newly built home offers panoramic views over the Cheshire countryside from its elevated position on The Edge.

Its new occupants will enjoy a master bedroom with en suite bathroom and dressing room, three further bedrooms and bathrooms, a plush sitting room and an open plan kitchen and dining area.

The property, known as The Lodge, also houses a lounge and media suite with an enormous wall-mounted flat screen, a wine cellar to store supplies for impromptu parties, and a 'spectacular' leisure suite with heated swimming pool and gym.

Balotelli's decision to leave the property, which will be available from February 16, has sparked rumours the larger than life Italian footballer could be set to move from Manchester City to a new club - possibly to Inter Milan.

The 22-year-old, who regularly hits the headlines for his antics on and off the football pitch, was involved in a training ground bust-up with City boss Roberto Mancini earlier this month.

The Cheshire house is a different property from the one Balotelli accidentally set on fire after he and his friends let off fireworks inside.

The eccentric sportsman famously set his rented £3million home in Manchester alight in 2011 after setting off the fireworks in the bathroom.

Agent Gascoigne Halman describes the luxury property as being 'set in an elevated position on The Edge with panoramic views'.

'The Lodge is a stunning newly constructed residence with... the latest automated technology.'

Ideal for the security conscious, the home is kitted out with a state of the art CCTV and fully monitored alarm system.

Luxurious: The new occupants will be able to take advantage of professionally landscaped gardens, a sun terrace off the kitchen, and an astro turf putting green

Eye-watering rent: The 22-year-old star's former home is advertised on rightmove.co.uk for the sum of £13,495 per month
