It is believed around 200 people have been put to death in Iran since its new president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June

A death row prisoner in Iran is to be hanged for a second time once he 'becomes well again' after he survived an initial bungled execution.

The 37-year-old man named as Alireza M was 'put to death' in the Islamic regime's Bojnourd prison last Wednesday for drugs offences.

After 12 minutes, he was certified as dead and taken to the prison morgue.

But when his family went to collect his body the following day, they noticed he was still breathing and rushed him to hospital.

One family member told Iran's state-run media: 'When we were told the death sentence had been carried out, we went to collect his body to prepare for a memorial service.

'But when we went to the coroner's office we found him alive again, which made his two daughters very happy.'

Once officials were told Alireza M had survived, they put him under armed guard at the hospital to await a second execution.

A judiciary official told the state media: 'The verdict was the death sentence, and it will be carried out once the man gets well again.'

Iran has executed an estimated 560 people this year - including around 200 that have been put to death since new 'moderate' president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June.

Rouhani vowed to end the repression of the previous regime, but human rights groups have said executions have actually increased under his rule.

Iran has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any nation except China.

Many of the condemned are executed for theft, drugs-related offences, not following the rules of Islam or criticising the government.

They are often hanged publicly in town centres or from bridges and cranes.

Maryam Namazie, of the campaign group Iran Solidarity, said: 'Rouhani was quoted saying he wanted to empty the prisons - it seems the regime intends to do so via executions.'
