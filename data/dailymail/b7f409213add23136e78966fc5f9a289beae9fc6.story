A mother has told of her utter disbelief at
hearing how her son’s drunk friend left him to drown in a sinking 
car and telling police there was no-one inside.

The family of John Quinnin listened 
in horror as they heard for the first time in court how Anthony Grant 
callously allowed his friend to die.

Grant had got drunk and then driven at speeds of over 80mph with John in the passenger seat. He lost control and crashed, the car tumbling into a marsh.

Rescuers pulled screaming Grant from the sinking vehicle. But when asked if there was anyone else in the car, he calmly told police he was on his own.

At Edinburgh's High Court, Grant today admitted causing death by dangerous driving and being over the drink drive limit.

He was remanded into custody until he is sentenced next month.

As Grant faces jail, John’s mum Tracey revealed her agony 
and fury after learning how the killer motorist abandoned her son.

She said: 'We were lost for words. 
You can’t describe how we felt at that moment. We feel anger and every 
other emotion you can imagine'

It was almost 12 months ago 
that 22-year-old John, of Annitsford, North Tyneside, had gone to 
Scotland on holiday with two friends - including Grant, 21, of Newcastle
upon Tyne.

All three were staying at a caravan 
park in Gatehouse of Fleet and went to the bar on the evening of June 8.

John had just received the good news that he had landed a dream job at the Nissan factory in nearby Sunderland.

The boys bought five bottles of wine and drank four before taking the
last back to the caravan.

Then John joined Grant in his Vauxhall Vectra - a vehicle Grant owned despite having no driving licence.

Grant was speeding along the A75 
Gretna to Stranraer road at over 80mph when he clipped the kerb on a 
tight bend near Kirkcowan in Wigtownshire.

Careering out of control, the car hit
a hazard marker post and trees before smashing into a telegraph pole 
and rolling down an embankment, eventually landing on its roof in a 
marsh.

Rescuers pulled Grant free and it was
then he told them he was alone in the vehicle, even though John had 
been sat beside him, and was in a much worse condition having suffered a
serious chest injury.

John’s parents Patrick, 51, and 
Tracey, 42, travelled to Edinburgh for the case in the High Court and 
listened in horror as the grim details of their son’s death emerged.

Tracey said: 'I got so choked up. We only found out in court. It’s just beyond belief.

'We couldn’t do anything. We were in 
court and weren’t allowed to say anything. We knew he hadn’t shown any 
remorse or tried to make any contact with Patrick and me, or send us 
anything, but what kind of a friend is that?

'He was supposed to be John’s friend -
he wasn’t one we knew or had met but we thought they were friends. So 
how could he have said that he was the only one in the car? We don’t 
understand it.

'We actually felt quite sorry for him
for a while - that’s the worst part. We also wonder what might have 
happened if rescuers had got to John earlier.

'I think the damage was too great, so I don’t think he could have survived, but it’s something we’ll question.'

The court heard how the first 
witnesses on the scene heard Grant screaming and shouting he was 
drowning, so one man contacted the emergency services and another made 
his way down the embankment.

When the emergency services arrived at the scene they believed there was only one person in the vehicle.

Advocate depute Iain McSporran told 
the court: 'Police officers saw a bare arm submerged in water which they
believed to be the accused’s arm. The accused was struggling to keep 
his head above water.'

A paramedic smashed the driver’s window with a torch and cut the seatbelt to free Grant from the wreckage.

It was only once he had been released
that rescuers realised there was someone else in the car as they could 
still see an arm of the person who was submerged.

When they finally pulled John free he had no pulse and he died as a result of the chest injury.

The court head that Grant has previous convictions 
for drink driving, driving without a licence and insurance and taking a 
vehicle without consent that stretch back to a juvenile court appearance
in 2004.

Tracey said: 'Obviously it’s given us
peace of mind knowing he’s been remanded - I don’t know what I would 
have done if they’d bailed him.

'Now we’ve just got to wait to see what he gets. Hopefully we will get some justice.

'It’s a slight relief for us that 
he’s admitted it, and now we can try to get our life back. But his death
has affected every part of both of us.

'You can’t imagine what it’s like . . . we’re taking each day at a time but we can’t enjoy ourselves. It’s all too raw.'

The pain of dealing with her grief 
became all too much and the distraught mum, 42, attempted to take her 
own life just three months ago.

Both she and Patrick have been unable to work since their son’s death.

Tracey was forced to give up her job as a senior carer, and she doesn’t know when she will be able to return.

She said: 'I went back to work but I 
couldn’t cope,' she said. 'I took an overdose and was in intensive care 
for three days. I’m not proud of it but it’s all part and parcel of 
life.

'But I’m still here and I’m pleased I’m here. It all got too much.

'I’m aware of what I’ve put my family
through but I just don’t want to care about anybody - I don’t want to 
care for people. I just think why has all this happened?'

John’s close friend Stephen Carter, 22, of North Shields, condemned Grant’s actions as 'disgraceful'.

The Greggs bakery operative said: 
'He’s got to live with this for the rest of his life. No one will trust 
him. No one wants to be his friend, it’s disgraceful.

'He must have known that John was in a
worse condition than him but he just thought about himself and got the 
people to help him first.

'John was the innocent person in all of this and he never did a bad thing.

'He was my best friend and not a day goes by when I don’t think about him.'
