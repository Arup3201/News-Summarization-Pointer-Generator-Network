West Ham United striker Mauro Zarate is in talks over a loan move to Queens Park Rangers.

The 27-year-old, who also has an offer from Deportivo La Coruna, only joined West Ham in the summer from Argentine club Velez Sarsfield.

He has, however, struggled to hold down a first-team place due to the form of Diafra Sakho, Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia and will undergo a medical with QPR on Tuesday.

Zarate, who has scored two goals for West Ham, could complete the move before QPR’s FA Cup game against Sheffield United this weekend.

QPR have also enquired about Atletico Madrid winger Cristian Rodriguez.

Harry Redknapp is also hoping he can finalise a move for midfielder Ryan Manning from Irish side Galway.
