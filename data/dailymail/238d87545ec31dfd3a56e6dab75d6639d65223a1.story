A 93-year-old man hid a human leg bone found by his dog for fear he would be accused of murder before eventually letting his daughter call the authorities.

Bill Flowers, of Nisqually, Washington, panicked last week when his dog bit off more than he could chew. The black pit bull mix named Liberty trotted home last Tuesday with a leg bone attached to a foot.

‘I was afraid they'd blame me for it,' the World War II vet told KIRO.

The elderly man first took the gruesome find from his dog and placed on top of a woodpile for two days before taking it out back and burying it, he explained.

‘I didn't know what to do with it,’ he told KIRO. ‘I took it and put it on top of the wood pile so the dog couldn't get it. It laid there two days and I took it and buried it.’

His daughter Cheryl soon found out and insisted he call the local sheriff.

The place was soon crawling with investigators and police dogs searching for more remains.

Cadaver dogs tracked down a pelvis, ribcage and skull, officials told the station. The coroner is trying to determine the identity of the person found.

‘At this point it does not appear that it would be related to any of our current reported missing people or runaways,’ an official told the station, adding that the find is being treated as a homicide.

Officials have no indication they plan to implicate Mr Flowers in the disappearance of the person.

The investigation remains ongoing.
