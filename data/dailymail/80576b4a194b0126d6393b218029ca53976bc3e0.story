The TV star said in a statement that she's a long-time supporter of the party and looks forward to working with those who share her values.

As for her platform, Miss Barr said she will push for the legalisation of marijuana.

She said the two major parties aren't doing enough to properly serve the American people.

'The Democrats and Republicans have proven that they are servants - bought and paid for by the 1 per cent - who are not doing what's in the best interest of the American people,' Barr said.

The Occupy movement popularized the 'We are the 99 per cent' slogan in their fight against economic disparity and perceived corporate greed.

Miss Barr's hit TV sitcom Roseanne aired from 1988 to 1997 and earned her an Emmy and a Golden Globe.

'Disgrace': In 1990, Miss Barr famously delivered a shrieking rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner before a packed Jack Murphy Stadium

She played a wise-cracking mom in the comedy about a blue-collar family. 

Miss Barr has a 46-acre macadamia nut farm in Hawaii, where her reality TV show Roseanne’s Nuts takes place.

In 1990, she famously delivered a shrieking rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner at a packed Jack Murphy Stadium before a baseball game between the San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati Reds.

She topped off the cringe-inducing performance by spitting on the field and grabbing her crotch to a chorus of boos from the crowd.  

Critics of the performance were joined by then-President George H.W. Bush, who called it 'disgraceful'.

While Miss Barr's presidential campaign filing became official yesterday, she announced her desire to run for America's highest office in May 2010 on her website.

In a lengthy campaign speech posted on her website, she said her campaign platform is three-fold: 'MAKE WAR ILLEGAL AND LEGALISE HEMP, CHANGE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF GOVERNMENT' and (MOST IMPORTANT) I WILL OUTLAW BULLS***'.

The Green Party's presidential nominee will be selected at a convention in Baltimore in July.

Barr said she has been fighting for working-class families and women for decades.

'I will barnstorm American living rooms,' she said in a candidate questionnaire submitted to the Green Party.

'Mainstream media will be unable to ignore me, but more importantly they will be unable to overlook the needs of average Americans in the run-up to the 2012 election.'

Miss Barr later posted on Twitter: 'vote for me, I'll fix this s***! -Barr 2012-'.
