Nick Clegg believes he and his fellow MPs should be forced to publish their tax returns - but suggested this new transparency should not be extended to his own highly-paid lawyer wife and other politicians' spouces.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would 
be happy to publish his own ‘rather boring’ tax return to reassure 
voters that he was subject to the same rules as everyone else.

But he suggested his wife Miriam, a high-flying City lawyer and the director of a 
Spanish building firm, who is likely to earn much more than the £134,565 her 
husband earns, was off limits.

He was asked on ITV news if his wife would have to make her earnings public.

Mr Clegg repolied: ‘The principle 
needs to be a simple one – us politicians, as servants of the public – 
should make our own arrangements transparent.

'But I don’t think we 
should necessarily call on other people to do that.’

Mr Clegg's Spanish-born wife Miriam, who has kept her maiden name of Gonzalez Durantez, is a fiercely independent woman

Although her income is unknown, the mother-of-three has had a glittering career in the legal profession and is likely to earn a large six-figure salary.

She is a partner of U.S. law firm Dechert, where she works as the Head of the EU Trade and EU Relations at their offices in the City of London.

Before that she  spent six years working for legal giants DLA Piper.

Since 2010, she has also been a non-executive director of Acciona, the Spanish renewable energy infrastructure projects and water management conglomerate.

The couple live in a large detached Georgian house in Putney, south-west London, worth an estimated £1.5million. They also have use of two luxury houses on the Continent.

His parents Nicholas Snr and Hermance own a 20-room chalet in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos Wolfgang and a chateau and a 10-room chateau in south-western France.

Despite Tory warnings that the move would fuel the politics of ‘envy’, Mr Clegg suggested that all MPs should publish their tax returns as ‘a matter of principle’.

His comments go much further than Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne who have suggested that any transparency drive would be limited to senior ministers.

Speaking at an event in London’s 
Canary Wharf, Mr Clegg said: ‘I have got no principle objection
to greater transparency by politicians of their tax return.

'I
think you would probably find mine rather boring – I earned one salary 
and paid tax on it, and that’s it. It’s a matter of public record 
already.’

Ministers have 
also come under pressure to say whether they benefited from the decision
in the Budget to reduce the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p for 
those earning more than £150,000.

The calls have intensified in recent 
days following claims that Labour’s London mayoral candidate Ken 
Livingstone channelled his earnings through a company to minimise his 
tax bill.

Mr Osborne 
indicated last week that the Government was considering whether 
ministers, including the Prime Minister, should be more transparent 
about personal tax.

The 
move would be unprecedented for a sitting Prime Minister. Mr Cameron 
believes that people seeking the ‘highest office’ should expect such 
scrutiny. Yesterday he said he was ‘very relaxed’ about the idea, which 
he said looked ‘increasingly likely’ to take place.

Nick Clegg said that politicians are 'servants of the public, therefore the public has the right to know' about their tax returns

In a swipe at Vince Cable, the Prime Minister said he had never done anything that could be regarded as avoiding tax – unlike people who failed to pay VAT.

The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary ran into trouble last year when it emerged he had been fined £500 for an outstanding £10,000 tax bill.

Sources have previously suggested that any publication would be limited to the tax affairs of Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne, Mr Clegg and Foreign Secretary William Hague. It is unclear how much detail, if any, will eventually be published.

But tax expert Richard Murphy, of the campaign group Tax Research UK, yesterday warned that even full publication of ministers’ tax returns would give little idea of whether they were dodging tax.

Mr Murphy said: ‘A great deal of tax avoidance isn’t seen on the tax return itself. One of the first objectives of the tax avoider is to make sure that their income is not theirs as far as the Revenue is concerned – they may move it into a company, or offshore. Just publishing the tax return won’t tell the whole story.’

And Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger 
warned that publication of MPs’ tax affairs risked fuelling envy among 
voters. And he urged ministers to focus instead on making public the tax
affairs of major corporations accused of avoiding millions in tax.

Mr
Liddell-Grainger, chairman of the all-party group on tax, said: ‘The 
problem is not me, or MPs – what is much more important is companies and
corporations and very wealthy individuals.

‘If you publish the tax returns of people willy-nilly across the UK then I think you will get the envy factor and jealousy.’

Mr Clegg’s comments came as he revealed that senior figures from all three main parties began talks yesterday on political funding following a string of scandals.

He said: ‘Party funding scandals have blighted all parties – no party is purer than the driven snow.’

Publishing the tax returns of politicians would not necessarily give any idea of the scale of their assets, experts warned.

Chancellor George Osborne, for example, is a beneficiary of  a trust that is reported to be worth £4million, which would not appear on his tax return.

Ministers’ salaries, which are already in the public domain, would be on the tax return. They also give limited information  on the income received from  savings, shareholdings, property lettings and trusts.

But the true scale of their wealth would remain secret.

Because Mr Osborne currently receives no income from his trust, it would not be listed on his tax return. The offices of David Cameron and Nick Clegg said that neither of them are beneficiaries of trust funds.

Senior ministers have come under pressure to provide more detail about their affairs following the decision to cut the top rate of tax for people earning more than £150,000.

Mr Cameron is believed to pay the top rate, which was cut from 50p to 45p in the Budget, but  Mr Osborne has said he does not. Mr Clegg has also indicated that he is not a top earner.

The Prime Minister does, however, receive thousands of pounds a year by renting out his Notting Hill home while living in grace-and-favour apartments in Downing Street.

But he is allowed to offset it against a mortgage – making it hard to work out how much cash he receives.

Accountant Richard Murphy, founder of the campaign group Tax Research UK, said that even  if the returns were published  in full they would not reveal whether politicians were using the numerous loopholes to avoid tax.

He added: ‘It would tell us that some people have higher incomes than others and that some people have investments. But it will not tell us who is tax avoiding and who is not.

‘If someone is doing something they shouldn’t be they can get round it and it will never appear on a tax return.’
