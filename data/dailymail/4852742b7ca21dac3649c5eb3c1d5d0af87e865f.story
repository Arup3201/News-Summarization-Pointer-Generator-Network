Police in California have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 30-year-old Perla Avina, a mother of four who was killed in a road-rage attack four days ago.

Carl Duboe, 20, was caught Wednesday in the Sacramento suburb of Elk Grove, about 90 miles from where the shooting happened in East Oakland.

Police there sent in a SWAT team and arrested Dubose after a short standoff, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

Perla Avina, 30, was traveling in a black 1998 Toyota Camry with husband Mando Lopez when they got into a confrontation with Dubose in East Oakland, police says.

Dubose allegedly fired at the vehicle, piercing the windshield on the passenger side and striking Avina in the face. 

As Dubose sped off, Lopez pulled over at the 400 block of Rossmoor Avenue in Brookfield Village neighborhood, before putting pressure on his wife's face and crying: 'Wake up!'

Meanwhile, resident Dwayne Jackson, who heard the commotion, rushed outside and dialed 911. He first tried to perform first aid on Avina, but she remained unconscious.

'I didn't see any signs of life,' Jackson told NBC. 'There was no waking [her] up.' 

Paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes but could not save Avina. She was pronounced dead in the Camry.

The suspect allegedly fired at Avina's vehicle through the windshield and hit her in the face before fleeing

Avina, a medical receptionist from Los Angeles, has four children with Lopez. The youngest child is just 18-months-old

Police later said the motivation for the shooting was likely road rage.

'[Road rage] is extremely dangerous,' a police spokesman said. 'In this case, it turned deadly.'

Avina, a medical receptionist from Los Angeles, leaves behind four children, the youngest of whom is just 18-months-old, authorities said.

None of the children were in the car at the time of the shooting, KTVU.com reported. 

Jackson described Avina as the 'heart' of the family, saying: 'She made the family work, with the kids, and school and working.'

The victim's grief-stricken parents, Jose and Herlinda Avina, said the day of the shooting that finding their daughter's killer was the only thing that could slightly ease their 'inconsolable pain.'

'If [anyone] knows the person who did this, please turn him in,' Herlinda Avina begged before Dubose was arrested. 'Turn him into the police, please, please, help us.'

Darlene Cederborg, Avina's manager at the Emeryville medical clinic where she worked, said she was a 'shining spirit' who 'always had a smile on her face'.

'This was a beautiful young woman with four young children and there was no reason for it. This never should have happened,' she said.
