Mahone, 12, (above) was made to hold paint buckets while standing outdoors in 90-degree heat while wearing a dress and makeup for hours as punishment because he took off his shoes when he was asked not to

Mahone was reportedly being punished because he took his shoes off after being told not to, and was also kicked by Pitts after he collapsed in the sun, according to District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. 

During the punishment, the boy frequently complained of thirst and fatigue before he collapsed and passed out in the sun, according to the DA's office.

He was then kicked several times by Pitts which left bruises and bumps all over his body, according to the AJC.

Mahone's sister, Sabrina Powell (above), was also arrested following his death, and remained in Fulton County jail during Pitts' sentencing as she awaits trial

Neighbor Hakim Deen, who captured the assault on video from an upstairs window, said he saw Pitts kicking Mahone in the head.

He said: 'Eight or nine times, he kicked him. The boy got up and then passed out.'

Mahone was taken to the South Fulton Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

His older sister, Sabrina Powell, was also arrested following his death, remained in Fulton County jail during Pitts' sentencing as she awaits trial.
