President Obama voiced his growing frustration over his administration's handling of the Ebola crisis in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday.

Convening his top aides in the Cabinet room after clearing his schedule for the day, the President let it be known how angry he was about how the government had handled key elements of the response.

This anger no doubt stemmed from the news earlier that day that not only did a second nurse, Amber Vinson, contract the disease while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan in a Dallas, Texas, hospital, but that she had also been able to board a plan and travel back and forth to Cleveland, Ohio, that weekend, while showing symptoms of a fever.

'This Frontier thing took it out of the abstract thing and to this level where people could identify with and made them scared,' a senior official told the New York Times.

The President put things more bluntly in the meeting, telling his aides, 'It's not tight,' while discussing their response efforts.

He then placed a majority of the blame over the botched handling of the crisis on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who he felt did not adequately train doctors and nurses at hospital as to proper protective procedures when dealing with a patient who has the disease and who he feels has been providing shifting information about the threat categories certain individuals who may have the disease are in.  

In an attempt to coordinate the efforts of his administration, it was confirmed on Friday that Obama had appointed Vice President Joe Biden's former Chief of Staff Ron Klain to serve as Ebola czar.

And while Klain is a seasoned crisis-response operative, many are hesitant about his new role as he has no actual healthcare experience.

At the same time, national security adviser Susan Rice is working with other countries including Britain, Germany and France, to try and get them to do more to respond to the outbreak.

'It’s not that people aren’t doing anything,' a senior official pointed out. 

'It’s that they’re not yet doing enough.'
