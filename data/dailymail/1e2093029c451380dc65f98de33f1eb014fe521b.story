For those who love the marine wildlife - now is your chance to swim with the gentle giants and let nature take its course.

The Sunreef Humpback Whale Swim Experience is an Australian first, giving tourists an opportunity to swim with the captivating whales in Mooloolaba, a resort town 100km north of Brisbane

The concept was conceived by Sunreef Whale Encounter Supervisor Dan Hart, who said Sunreef was excited to be offering this great experience on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast.

It's a life changing experience - to have a humpback whale just a couple of metres away

'I swam with humpback whales in Tonga and it is something very special,' he said.

'It was such a breathtaking and mind-blowing experience I thought it should be made available to more people. So I thought, why not start it here?

'It’s a life changing experience – to have a humpback whale just a couple of metres away looking you right in the eye.  It’s indescribable.

'It gives you such a sense of these amazing creatures and we are excited to be able to offer it to everyone.'

Mr Hart said the swimming with whales experience was operated under a strict Code of Conduct to protect both the whales and the participants.

The experience is a three-hour round trip with a maximum of 20 participants on each trip.

Mr Hart said Sunreef provide a full briefing on what to expect and safety procedures as well as providing all required wetsuit and snorkeling equipment.

After a whale is sighted by the company's spotter plane, the boat will be put into neutral 100m or more away from the whale, and if the conditions are determined as safe by trained crew, the boat will be turned off and swimmers will be allowed into the water holding to the floating line attached to the boat.

'Then it’s all up to the whale – it is a natural experience and it is 100% on the whale’s own terms,' Mr Hart said.

'We have 100% success rate seeing whales and about 50% success rate in getting people in the water with them.

'Whales are known as curious creatures so they may come over towards us or they may just swim past or away.  Either way it’s an experience you will never forget.'

'In our experience, the whales seem as intrigued by us as we are of them and often come close to swimmers, gliding effortlessly around us, with such a gentleness that its like they recognise our fragility in comparison and know we are there out of wonder and respect,' he said.

'Our first Swim with the Whales experiences will run from the 6th of July and we will continue to offer them throughout the season.'

BBC reports given the issue’s sensitivity, Mr Hart spent two years consulting with wildlife officials, marine biologists and ecotourism experts to create an activity template that ensured swimmers' safety and didn't affect the whales.

University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, environmental science lecturer Sheila Pyke said it would be a 'wow' experience when tourists hear the noises whales make and feel their vibrations in the water.

'When those people go home, many will speak out against whaling. But this year is very much going to be a wait-and-see for them to figure out if the trial has been successful,' she said.

CEO Sunshine Coast Destinations Limited Simon Ambrose said he is excited to support Sunreef in this exciting Australian first humpback whale swimming experience.
