Forty photographers joined forces in London to create the biggest ever crowd-sourced timelapse in just one day. 

The diversity, atmosphere, pace and buzz of the city make London the perfect canvas for any timelapse, and its unique flavour is captured over 80 clips in the official LapseLondon film produced by Triggertrap.

Under the expert guidance of professional timelapse photographer Chad Gordon Higgins and award-winning urban photographer Nicholas Goodden, the gang of eager photographers set out across the city to capture London from their own perspective.

The photographers were keen to shoot varying locations in London which helped produce the spectacular timelapse

Starting from Triggertrap's headquarters in King's Cross, the photographers found themselves in all four corners of the capital.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Triggertrap Head of Photography Thomas Langley said: 'It was a very tiring day, but at the same time such a good day, it was exceptional.

'We all met at the office, and then the photographers all went to their chosen locations; what was brilliant is that we had a group who wanted to spread far and wide throughout London.

'It wasn't a case of everyone all wanting to do the London Eye or the other more famous sites; in fact we had only two at the London Eye and the results from each were very different.'

The 80 clips were assembled from well over 35,000 individual photographs, representing a total of over 40 hours spent timelapsing

On thoughts for the next project, Langley added: 'Now we are thinking how we can go bigger and how we can do better, maybe we can do a timelapse of the world!' 

By the end of the day the team of photographers had created clips shot from a whole range of London's landmarks, from Tower Bridge to Camden Market, Oxford Circus to the Thames Barrier, and even gained access to the BBC Newsroom in full swing. 

The LapseLondon photographers managed to cover a huge variety of London views and experiences, highlighting the amazing and diverse city it is.

The 80 clips were assembled from well over 35,000 individual photographs, representing a total of over 40 hours spent timelapsing across the capital - all in a single day. 

The final video is an ode to London, showing the beauty of one random day in December in London through the eyes of 40 photographers. The assembled photographers had a huge range of experience - from professional timelapse creators to amateur photographers attempting their first ever timelapse.

As people went about their everyday lives, a team of photographers were on hand to capture scenes around London

Triggertrap also produced a behind-the-scenes documentary about the event, interviewing a number of the photographers involved to find out what they love about London and how they're using timelapse photography to capture the pulse of the capital.

'The crazy thing about being a photographer is that your art has a huge audience, but when you are creating, you're on your own, operating in a vacuum. I think bringing together a load of people who shoot timelapse is up there with one of the most awesome things I've ever done.' said Haje Jan Kamps, CEO of Triggertrap

Triggertrap's Helena Viera added: 'Bringing together a whole bunch of photographers from different skill levels and seeing how everyone helped each other to create such awesome clips must be one of the most rewarding things I've done all year.'

The finished timelapse and behind the scenes documentary are available on the Triggertrap website, http://tri.gg/lapselondon, and their Vimeo channel, vimeo.com/triggertrap.
