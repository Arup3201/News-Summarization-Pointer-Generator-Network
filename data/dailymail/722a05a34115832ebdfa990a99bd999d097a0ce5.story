A British couple died along with their future son-in-law when the plane he was piloting crashed into a lakeside forest in Canada.

Peter Keate, 81, and his 79-year-old wife Inez were in a float plane flown by Scotsman Colin Moyes that struck a hillside and burst into flames after taking off from Okanagan Lake in British Colombia.

Mr Moyes, 52, had been set to wed the Keates' youngest daughter Alexandra next month.

Sadly missed: Peter Keate, 81, and his wife Inez, 79, had five children, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren

The Keates, originally from Exeter, had five children, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Eyewitnesses said the plane appeared to be trying to gain height when it hit trees.

Friends said Mr Moyes, who had an 11-year-old son and was originally from Peebles, in the Scottish Borders, was a 'phenomenal flyer'.

Dale Floyd said: 'It was a huge passion of his - he flew every chance he could get.'

The Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, said a fire destroyed the aircraft's logs.

'Devastated': Family and friends have paid tribute to Peter and Inez Keate and Colin Moyes, who were killed in a crash involving a de Havilland Beaver float plane like the one pictured above

The single-engine de Havilland Beaver, which Mr Moyes had bought a year earlier, crashed on Sunday, May 13.

His wedding on June 23 would have been his second trip down the aisle after his first wife died of cancer.

Mr Keate, a quantity surveyor who served as a captain in the Royal Engineers, married Inez in 1956.

The couple and Mr Moyes had emigrated to Canada.

Mrs Keate's sister, Susan White, of St Thomas, Exeter, said she would be flying out to Canada for a memorial service on Sunday.

She told the Exeter Express and Echo newspaper: 'It was a great shock when we heard the news.

'We were on holiday in Spain at the time. Peter and his family were very well-known in Exeter.'

Christopher Georgas, the owner of Pacific Rim Aviation Academy Inc, based at Pitt Meadows Airportnear Vancouver, paid tribute to Mr Moyes.

He said: 'Mere words cannot express the incredible sense of loss that the aviation community here at Pitt Meadows and across the nation is feeling at this very moment.

'The tragic loss of a loved one and those closest to him came in the spiritual form of a great man, father, partner, husband, relative colleague and a gift to the world.Â 

'All of us have been affected and are truly devastated.'

The investigation into the crash is expected to take months because the plane was so badly damaged.

Bill Yearwood of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said: 'The post-crash fire consumed the logs of the aircraft and a lot of the evidence.'
