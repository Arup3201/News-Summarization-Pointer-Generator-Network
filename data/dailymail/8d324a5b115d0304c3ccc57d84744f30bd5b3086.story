If there was any doubt that Christina Aguilera has well and truly embraced her fuller figure, then look no further.

The 31-year-old singer put in a very confident turn on Tuesday as she poured (and squeezed) her very generous proportions into a form-fitting body contour dress.

Needless to say, Christina - with dress pulled taut over her bust and bottom - delivered an eye-catching look as she arrived to present the American Music Award nominations at press conference in Los Angeles.

Scroll down for video and list of nominations...

Check me out! Christina Aguilera confidently sticks out her derriere as she poses for photographers on Tuesday at the American Music Awards nominations press conference in Los Angeles

The Beautiful songstress was in full-on 
performance mode for the photographers - sticking out her rounded 
derriere, putting her hands on hips and twirling round for her 
over-the-shoulder shot in a series of moves that threatened derail Kim 
Kardashian's reputation as having the most famous bottom in Hollywood.

The Voice judge completed her style 
with a pair of sky-high silver heels, fake eyelashes along with her 
newly-dyed pink and purple-tipped blonde tresses.

And then there was the fake tan. And lots of it.

Figure-hugging: The cut of the dress certainly drew attention to The Voice judge's generous proportions

Christina, a mother of one, had 
slathered it on in abundance, particularity so over her legs - which 
appeared to be a darker shade than the rest of her body.

Aguilera, who announced the AMA nominees on Tuesday, was the first performer to be announced for the 
live show, which takes place next month.

R&B star Rihanna and rapper Nicki 
Minaj led nominations for the American Music Awards with four apiece, 
edging out stiff competition from pop sensations Justin Bieber and One 
Direction.

Rihanna, 24, was nominated in the top 
category - artist of the year - where she will compete with Bieber, Katy
Perry, pop-rockers Maroon 5 and Canadian rapper Drake.

She also won nods for female 
soul/R&B artist and album for Talk That Talk, and will battle Minaj,
29, in the female pop/rock artist category.

Minaj scored two nods for her album 
Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded in both the pop/rock and rap/hip hop 
categories this year, as well as a nomination for favorite rap artist, 
alongside Drake and American newcomer Tyga.

Minaj has been making headlines after 
joining the American Idol judging panel, where she was caught feuding on
camera with fellow judge Mariah Carey in early audition rounds.

Boyfriend singer Bieber, 18, landed 
three nominations this year, tying with British boy band One Direction, 
Maroon 5, Drake and R&B star Usher.

Following in the footsteps of the 
Grammy Awards earlier this year, which hosted a tribute to electronic 
dance music, the American Music Awards introduced a new category in that
genre, with David Guetta, Calvin Harris and Skrillex competing for the 
trophy.

Last year's big winners, Adele and Taylor Swift, who both scored three awards each, received one nomination each this year.

Leading the charge: Nicki Minaj, left, and Rihanna topped the nominations list with four apiece

Hot British exports: Boy band One Direction, performing here at the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards in London on Sunday, scooped three nods

Swift scored a nod for female country 
artist alongside Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert, while Adele was 
nominated in the favorite adult contemporary artist category alongside 
Kelly Clarkson and Train.

The closely-watched new artist 
category will be a battle between R&B singer J.Cole, indie-pop ban 
fun., Australian singer-songwriter Gotye, Canadian pop singer Carly Rae 
Jepson and One Direction.

The AMA winners are determined by fans through online voting, which starts on Tuesday.

The American Music Awards will be 
celebrating its 40th anniversary this year and the ceremony and 
performance show will be broadcast live from Los Angeles on November 18.
