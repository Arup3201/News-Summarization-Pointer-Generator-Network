A holidaymaker plunged 50 metres to his death in a horrific cliff fall in front of his wife and two children.

The 52-year-old man was walking on a cliff path in West Cornwall when he is thought to have slipped on ground left muddy by recent heavy rain.

A sea and air rescue was launched after his family raised the alarm but he was declared dead after his body was recovered from rocks at the base of the cliff.

The tragedy comes as Britain faces a 
Bank Holiday washout with yet more severe conditions and wet weather 
expected later in the week.

The Met office issued early weather warnings for next week with persistent heavy rain expected to spread across the country during Wednesday evening and the early hours of Thursday.

The lowest temperature recorded overnight on Friday was in south-west Scotland, where it plummeted to -6C (21.2F).

Yesterday,
 Scotland experienced snow, while the skies over southern England were 
grey with patchy rain. Further north, sunny intervals were interspersed 
with showers.

Forecast: The dismal weather follows weeks of heavy rain which has caused flooding in many areas.

Temperatures in north-east England 
peaked at about 6C (42.8F), while in Cornwall, the mercury struggled to 
climb above 11C (51.8F).

'It's been pretty cold,' said forecaster Nick Prebble of MeteoGroup yesterday.

'We've
 seen flurries of snow over the Grampians and north-west Highlands, and 
there's been sleet there, too. There have also been a few light sleet 
showers in northern England.'

More snow flurries are forecast today over high ground in Scotland.

The unsettled weather is due to continue tomorrow, with a band of heavy rain edging north-east across most parts of the country.

'It's looking like most places will see a wet and breezy day,' Mr Prebble.

The tragedy in Cornwall happened 
early on Friday morning as the visitor from Basingstoke, Hampshire, was 
walking at the Cornish beauty spot.

A police spokesman said: 'A 52 year 
old male from the Basingstoke area was airlifted from the bottom of 
cliffs at Mullion around 7.45pm on Friday 4 May.

'The male was pronounced deceased at 
hospital. It is believed that the male had been walking with his wife 
and two young children along the cliff path prior to being found.

Police are treating the man's death as accidental. The coroner has been informed.

Falmouth Coastguards have warned other visitors to be very careful on muddy paths near unprotected cliffs.

A spokesman said: 'People who walk 
along paths should be aware that we have had a lot of wet weather and 
the ground may be slippery.'

The dismal weather follows weeks of heavy rain which has caused flooding in many areas.

Four
 flood warnings remain in place and the Environment Agency said that 
while water levels were receding, officials were continuing to monitor the situation.

Yesterday, roads remained fairly clear, with many people opting to stay at home.

The Highways Agency said: 'The roads haven't been overly congested, performing well despite the weather.'
