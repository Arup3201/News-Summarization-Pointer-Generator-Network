The four daughters of a NYPD detective shot dead in a bungled robbery will today take turns telling him about the father he stole from them.

NYPD detective Peter Figoski was gunned down by Lamont Pride in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York in December 2011.

Today, his daughters will confront Pride in court as he is sentenced.

Pride was convicted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and burglary in Brooklyn Supreme Court earlier this month, but acquitted of aggravated murder. He faces up to 45 years behind bars.

Eldest daughter Christine Figoski, 21, told the New York Post:
'We talked about the things he's going to miss. He's going to miss our 
graduations, our proms, our weddings, and his grandchildren.

'In the statement we mention his 
dreams. Things that he wanted to do that he never got to do. He always 
wanted to go to the Grand Canyon, he wanted to get a motorcycle,' she 
said.

'He wanted to buy more land so he could build on it.'

During the trial, Caitlyn Figoski had
to leave the courtroom at one point as the jury heard in gruesome 
detail how Pride allegedly shot him in the face at close range.

The New York Daily News reported
that the young woman nearly fainted and needed assistance from her 
mother, Paulette, to exit; the distressed blonde did not return until 
opening statements were nearly over.

During his 22-year career in the force, Figoski earned 12 medals and made more than 200 arrests.

He was posthumously promoted to detective, first-class.

Figoski's top priority was always his daughters and it was widely known he put off retirement to ensure he had enough money to put them all through college.

His funeral drew up to 20,000 police officers, family members, and friends to the church in Long Island where the girls and their father were all baptised.

Support: Christine remembered that it was so busy, officers had lined up at the rail road just to pay their respects

He was accused of trying to steal 
from a marijuana dealer in a basement apartment in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York.

When the gang allegedly broke in and began beating the dealer, a neighbour called 911.

Figoski and his partner were providing backup to two officers when Pride and another man tried to flee, police said.

During
a struggle between his partner and one of the suspects, Figoski came
face-to-face with Pride, who allegedly shot him before the officer 
could draw his own weapon. He died in hospital hours later.
