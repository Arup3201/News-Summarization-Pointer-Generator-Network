Air strikes have killed more than 6,000 ISIS fighters including half of the top command, according to U.S. officials.

U.S. intelligence estimates that ISIS – also known as Islamic State – has a total force of between 9,000 and 18,000 fighters.

Stuart Jones, U.S Ambassador to Iraq, said yesterday that more than 6,000 ISIS extremists had been killed in Syria and Iraq since air strikes began.

Stuart Jones, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said yesterday that more than 6,000 ISIS extremists had been killed in Syria and Iraq since air strikes began and said the military effort was having a 'devastating' impact on ISIS

Prime Minister David Cameron met with  Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi at 10 Downing Street yesterday

He told Al Arabiya television that the military effort was having a 'devastating' impact on the extremist group.

Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel would not confirm the exact number of militants killed but confirmed 'thousands' had died. 

It came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Iraqi ground forces, backed by coalition air strikes, have taken back 700 square km of territory in Iraq from Islamic State.

Mr Kerry, who was in London for a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, said the fight against ISIS in Syria would take longer than in Iraq.

A large consignment of U.S.-made M16 rifles would be arriving in Iraq 'very, very shortly,' he said.

Mr Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, also agreed that the war could be lengthy and played down the importance of the recent estimated body count.

He said: 'I was in a war where there was a lot of body counts every day. And we lost that war.

'It's a measure but I don't think it's the measure.'

His comments came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he feared lower revenues from falling global oil prices could hurt his country's military campaign against ISIS.

Speaking after attending a meeting with Mr Cameron in London, Abadi said allies could help by potentially allowing Baghdad to defer payment for ammunition and weapons.

'Oil prices have dropped to about 40 per cent of their level last year. Iraq's economy and budget relies 85 per cent on oil and this has been disastrous for us,' he told a news conference.

'We don't want to see a reverse of our military victory due to our fiscal and budget problems.'

However, Mr Hagel in Washington blasted some of Abadi's recent criticism of the pace of past U.S. and coalition efforts to support Iraq.

'I do disagree with the prime minister's comments. I would say, even further, I don't think they're helpful,' he told a news briefing.

'We have a coalition of over 60 countries that have come together to help Iraq. And I think the prime minister might want to be a little more mindful of that.'

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in London yesterday), warned against complacency in the fight to 'disrupt these plots before they come to the stage of an attack'

Prior to meeting Mr Cameron, Mr Abadi asked the Prime Minister for more military training and ammunition.

Mr Cameron responded by confirming that Britain was ready to help, but stopped short of making any new commitments.

'The threat from extremist terror you face in Iraq is also a threat we face here in the United Kingdom,' he said.

'We will do everything we can to help stop foreign fighters coming to your country and creating the mayhem we see today.' 

Mr Hammond said the London meeting planned the next steps of the coalition's campaign against ISIS in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.

He said plans included doing more militarily, more to cut off the group's finances, and more to stem the flow of foreign fighters.

Mr Hammond said that the coalition could take up to two years to expel ISIS fighters from Iraq, and that Baghdad's own forces would be incapable of proper combat operations for months.

The meeting took place a day after Kurdish forces in northern Iraq said they had broken an Islamic State supply line between Mosul and strongholds to the west.
