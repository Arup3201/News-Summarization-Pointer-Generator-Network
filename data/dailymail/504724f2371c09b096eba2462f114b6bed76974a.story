Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has admitted that at least some of the country's current economic woes are down to him.

The ex-Labour leader said today his Government had not fully understood the impact economic integration could have on the British economy.

But, in an apparent warning to current party leader Ed Miliband, who wants Britain’s banks dramatically reined in, he insisted that a 'vibrant' financial sector was important for the UK.

Speaking on Sky News he said: 'In respect of the economy, yes, of course, everybody who was in power in the period bears a certain responsibility.'

He qualified the remark, however, arguing that the inter-depency of the world economy, which had developed over the last three decades, was also a major factor in causing the financial crisis.

He added: 'You have got this deep integration of the global economy and where you have a lot of financial instruments that were created whose impact people didn’t properly understand.'

Asked if that meant Labour did not fully understand it while he was in power, he replied: 'No, we didn’t.'

He added: 'A vibrant financial sector is also a very important part of our future.

'Take the necessary steps, but realise that a thriving and healthy banking sector is a major part of the modern British economy and will also be so.'

Mr Blair who has served as a Middle 
East envoy for the 'Quartet' - made up of the United Nations, United 
States, European Union and Russia - since leaving office, is keen to 
return to domestic politics.

He said: 'I feel I have got something to contribute to the debates that are going on in the country and I want to do that.

'We have got an extraordinary and uncertain and unpredictable situation today. I think we are living through an era of almost uniquely low predictability, economically and politically.

'We have got the eurozone crisis, which is one big issue. We have got what’s happening in the Middle East, which is another. You know, I have got things to say and if people want to listen, that’s great, and if they don’t, fine.'

Mr Blair said when Labour lost power, it traditionally lost power for a long time.

'I think it is possible in these circumstances to re-write that traditional script,' he added.

Tony Blair suggested Cherie had played a crucial role in helping to secure the London Olympics

'I know those people who are leading the Labour Party at the moment are desperate to do their best for the country.'

Responding to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s suggestion that he was open to working with Labour after the next election, Mr Blair said he was 'sceptical' about coalition.

Mr Blair also suggested his wife Cherie had played a crucial role in helping to secure the Olympics for the UK.

'It’s the strangest electorate I ever had to deal with. It’s about 120 people.

'Strangely, my wife played a very big part in this really because of the 120, some were the great and the good, members of royal families like our own Princess Anne and people who are very well known, and then you have the others that for various reasons worked in sports administration in their countries and they were also on the committee.

'People tended to make a big fuss of all the big names but everyone had the same vote and my wife was very, very good at going to different countries and seeing people before the Games who were the less significant, if you like, people.

'By the time we got to Singapore we knew those people, I then met them and was talking to them, all of these things helped, I think.'

A spokesman for Tony Blair's office said: 'The Blairs will support their children in whatever they decide to do, but the idea that either of them is interested in a dynasty is pure invention.'
