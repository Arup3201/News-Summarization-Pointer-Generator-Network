The multimillionaire pharmaceuticals entrepreneur accused of killing her 8-year-old son has admitted that despite fearing her ex-husband was plotting to kill her, she never reported the alleged threats to the police.

Gigi Jordan is on trial in Manhattan for the 2010 killing of her autistic son Jude Mirra. She is accused of giving him a lethal cocktail of pills after – she claims – he suggested they kill themselves.

In court on Wednesday, Jordan claimed that a bodyguard paid by her ex-husband and former business partner Ray Mirra to guard her and her son, had admitted he was actually there to kill her.

‘Did you ever call 911 about Mr. Harris being hired to kill you?’ Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos asked.

‘No,’ Jordan calmly told a skeptical courtroom, reports the New York Daily News. 

The credibility of her claims were further stretched when she admitted that she had never taken Ray Mirra off the emergency contact list at Jude's school - even after he had supposedly made death threats against her. 

Jude was found dead of a drug overdose in a pill-strewn, deluxe Manhattan hotel room in February 2010. Jordan, who had also taken pills, was found on the floor nearby. She claims she tried to revive her son after he took the pills.

Even though the second grader was unable to speak, she claims he urged her to take their lives by typing messages on her phone.

She claims they both feared that her ex-husband, Raymond Mirra, would kill her after she learned he'd allegedly stolen millions from her.

She said she did not know what would become of her son and feared that he would be left in the care of his biological dad who she accused of molesting him. Jude’s father Emil Tzekov has denied the allegation.

'Let's just get out while we can,' she claims Jude wrote on January 26, 2010, days before his body was found in the Peninsula Hotel. 'We r going to die anyway let's do it ourselves instead of them.

'We need to leave in a way we want to, not their way. Get the pills and try to do it.' 

She claims he wrote other messages claiming it wouldn't be murder and urged her to use 'a lot of drugs' so he would die peacefully. 

'I wish you do it soon,' she claims he wrote. 'I'm scare u r too chicken.' 

Standing trial: Jordan claims that her son urged her to take their lives because he feared his father would kill them. She claims she feared for her life after learning her ex had stolen money from her

She testified that she was in a place of desperation because she lived in fear of her ex-husband, who had legally adopted Jude. 

'I felt numb, defeated, I felt like it was over, it was done,' she said. 'There was nothing I could do.'

In court on Thursday, she explained that she deliberately gave her son a lethal dose of prescription drugs and exchanged goodbyes but later tried to revive him.

When she heard him struggle to breathe, 'my heart started pounding,' she testified.

'I raced over to him. I was crying and sobbing,' she said. 'I was crying and calling, 'Jude! Jude! Jude!' And then I started to attempt CPR.'

Her tearful account provided a stark contrast to the prosecution's portrayal of her as a dark woman coolly killing her only son.

Emergency responders' accounts of her condition have varied from incoherent to composed. 

Jordan says she set out to take her life and her son's for a complex set of reasons: Some ominous occurrences had convinced her that one of her ex-husbands would have her killed to keep her from raising allegations of financial malfeasance, and she felt that without her Jude would be unable to avoid a man she says sexually abused him.

Devastating: Prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her  lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism. Above, emergency crews take away Jude's body

Killed: The boy was non-verbal, had PTSD and immune system abnormalities, his mother claims

'I couldn't see any way out of the situation,' she said.

Both men have denied her allegations. Neither has been charged with any crime.

Prosecutors say Jordan had no right to kill Jude, whatever her reasoning.

They say Jordan climbed on top of her son and pried his mouth open - so forcefully that she left bruises on his face and chest - and plunged a deadly combination of painkillers, other drugs, vodka and orange juice down his throat with a syringe.

Then she got on her computer and transferred money out of her son's trust fund, Bogdanos has said. She also wrote a suicide note.

She has denied forcing the drugs down his throat and said the bruises reflect her effort to revive him. 

The nonverbal, often tormented-seeming Jude was initially deemed autistic but later was diagnosed with immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to Jordan.

Nonetheless, she says, Jude disclosed the abuse to her with gestures, his few words and, later, by typing on computers in a technique known as facilitated communication, with her touching his arm.

Various authorities rebuffed her requests to investigate the abuse allegation, she said. 

One of her inquiries instead ended with her hospitalized for a psychological examination in 2008. She was released within days.
