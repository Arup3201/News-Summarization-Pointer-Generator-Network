With a little help from her affair with newly-appointed Manchester United manager, Ryan Giggs, a stint on Big Brother and a LOT of lingerie shoots, Imogen Thomas became one of the most sought-after glamour girls of the decade.

But the Welsh beauty queen and former reality TV star says she has 'hung up' her lingerie to focus on motherhood.

Speaking to MailOnline, the mother-of-one said: 'I used to be desperate for magazine shoots, I was really enjoying it and while I've always got offers coming in, now I'm 31, it's time to hang up the lingerie.'

Imogen, who had her first child with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run', she is enjoying motherhood so much that she's 'letting the young girls' take care of the lingerie modelling now.

One part of having baby Ariana that Imogen didn't enjoy was putting on weight - and she's found it incredibly hard to shift.

'I was snacking on Ariana's food when we ate out. She would have two chips and I'd eat the rest. As all new mothers will know, it's so hard to lose weight, especially that stubborn part of your stomach.' she said.

Imogen - who went up to a size 12 after having her daughter - has been on a health kick and is now back at a size 10.

'I was really unhappy with that little pouch on my stomach so I have been eating healthily, exercising a lot and taking Nature's Way African Mango seed extract, which claims to target fat cell growth and help increase the breakdown of fats.

'It stops me snacking and just gives me that oomph in the morning. I also love trampolining, it's amazing for weight loss. I go to spin class and some days I dread it but always feel great after,' she said.

Imogen reveals that she's lucky enough not to have any stretch marks - probably thanks to her 'obsession' with skincare, which sees her scrubbing her skin for twenty minutes every single day.

Family: Imogen, who had her first child Ariana with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run' at lingerie modelling, she is enjoying motherhood too much to go back to it now

Thanks to her new fitness and beauty regime, Imogen says she finally feels body confident.

'I want to feel good on the poolside this summer and I definitely feel bikini-ready now. I can't wait to show off the results on my next holiday,' she said.

As for her diet, Imogen says she never deprives herself and instead swaps her favourite treats for healthy alternatives.

'I love sweet potatoes, but I also have the occasional helping of strawberries dipped in dark chocolate - I don't know how people can cut out treats completely.'

As well as focussing on her new health regime, Imogen says she's put work projects on hold to have some 'me time', hang out with her family and focus on redecorating their house.
