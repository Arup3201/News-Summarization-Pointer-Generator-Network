The boss of Starbucks has provoked fury by implying that the firm will not pay ‘normal’ levels of tax in the UK for up to three years.

Mark Fox said the coffee chain needed to get ‘its mojo back’ before it begins turning a profit in Britain.

But critics last night described the comments as an insult and urged customers to continue their boycott of the US firm.

Starbucks chief executive Mark Fox insisted there was ‘nothing abnormal’ about the way Starbucks was run - but admitted it was not likely to make a profit for another three years

Starbucks has been facing a backlash from consumers after it emerged it had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to Britain in 1998.

It did this by reporting financial losses for years, which it claimed were due to the steep running costs of its high street outlets.

The group has also been branded immoral for funnelling revenues – known as royalties – out of the UK and into the Netherlands and Switzerland.

But yesterday Mr Fox said these controversial arrangements ‘didn’t bother me at all’.

In a reference to the tax scandal that broke two years ago, Mr Fox, who runs Starbucks in the UK, said: ‘Fundamentally, the piece that was aerating was around royalties – the fact a brand is paying a royalty to an entity outside the UK, and to me that’s very, very ordinary.

Starbucks was at the centre of a tax-avoiding furore two years ago when it emerged it had only paid £8.6million in corporation tax – despite making £3billion in sales since opening in Britain in 1998

‘It happens across the sector and therefore it didn’t bother me at all. There was nothing abnormal about the way Starbucks is run in the UK. What is abnormal is that we haven’t been making a profit.’

The company is two years into a five-year plan to turn it into a profitable venture. When it starts making a profit, it has said it will begin paying tax. Mr Fox added: ‘As I look at the business now with eight quarters of growth, I don’t see a damaged brand, I see a brand starting to regain its mojo.’

But Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the influential Public Accounts Committee, urged customers to boycott the company until it changes its ways. She said: ‘I think it’s an insult to ordinary hard-working taxpayers across the country.

‘Hopefully it’s a big enough insult to his customers that they will take their business elsewhere. They will not win back the trust of the public unless they unwind these immoral schemes.’

The latest row to rock the company comes on the eve of George Osborne’s Autumn Statement, in which he will warn that Britain faces dwindling tax revenues.

Starbucks uses a host of measures to whittle down the profitability of its UK division.

The practices, which have been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, mean that it has not reported a profit in the UK since landing here in 1998.

The most controversial measure involves registering the rights to its brand and logo to a holding company based in the Netherlands.

For every cup of coffee sold on the UK high street, the company pays a 6 per cent royalty fee to its Dutch counterpart.

A second way of pushing money away from Britain relates to how the firm buys its coffee. The beans are purchased by an outfit based in low-tax Switzerland.

Despite never actually landing on Swiss soil, they are sold on at a mark-up to the Netherlands, which until recently was Starbucks’ European HQ.

In the Netherlands the beans are roasted in its giant plant in Amsterdam before being sold on – again at a mark-up – to all of its other European operations.

This means that the roasted beans are bought by Starbucks in the UK at a significant premium to the price initially paid by Starbucks in Switzerland.

All of this contributes to lower UK revenues, making it more difficult for it to turn a profit.

When the tax revelations emerged two years ago, the group volunteered to give £20million to the taxman over two years to try to prevent a widespread boycott of its coffee houses. These payments have now finished. But the comments from its chief executive, who joined the group only in January, have sparked a fresh wave of anger at its tax affairs.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s quite understandable that taxpayers don’t feel everyone pays their fair share.

‘But the power to fix that lies in the hands of politicians, who add complex loopholes and reliefs to the tax system year after year.’

Prime Minister David Cameron pledged to use Britain’s leadership of the G8 last year to clamp down on multinational firms that dodge tax.

Google, Amazon and Starbucks have all been criticised for legal but controversial methods they use to funnel revenues out of the UK and into lower tax jurisdictions.

The European Commission is trying to crack down on lucrative deals struck between US firms and governments across the continent that allow the companies to whittle down their tax bills.

Google uses Ireland to process all of its European sales, but uses a complex structure to push much of its income out to the notorious tax shelter of Bermuda.

Amazon claims that the beating heart of its European operations is a small office in Luxembourg, which it uses as a base for its business in the UK.

Apple has also been criticised for holding vast amounts of cash in offshore accounts.

Accountant Richard Murphy from Tax Justice Network, who worked on the initial investigation exposing Starbucks’ tax affairs, said: ‘Starbucks says it is not making a profit. But it has so far failed to convince anybody else.

‘When it makes its books open on the tablefor everyone to see we might accept what it is saying as the truth.

‘But until then we’re still in the dark and it still isn’t paying any tax.’

Starbucks has refused to comment on the latest remarks by Mr Fox, which he made in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper.

But a spokesman for the Unite union said: ‘Starbucks says these arrangements are ordinary. That depends entirely on how you define ordinary.

‘Many hard-working taxpayers, struggling to make ends meet, will be scratching their heads at Starbucks’ elaborate way of exporting their tax liabilities.

‘The Government has talked tough, but now it needs to act. Tax that is due to the British taxpayer is being exported.

‘It’s a ruse that they and other big multinationals use to avoid paying their fair share.'
