Argentina was warned to respect the wishes of the Falkland Islanders last night following their overwhelming vote to remain British.

David Cameron said Buenos Aires should take ‘careful note’ of the referendum, which went 99.8 per cent in favour of remaining a British overseas territory.

In a telephone call to Gavin Short, chairman of the Falklands Legislative Assembly, the Prime Minister said he was ‘over the moon’ with the result.

‘The Falkland islanders couldn’t have spoken more clearly,’ he said.

‘They want to remain British and that 
view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina. It is the
clearest possible result there could be.’

Just three unidentified islanders voted to end British sovereignty three decades on from the Falklands conflict.

A total of 1,517 valid votes were cast in the referendum, a turnout of 92 per cent of the eligible islanders.

The question was: ‘Do you wish the 
Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas
Territory of the United Kingdom?’

Alicia Castro, Argentina’s ambassador to the UK, said the vote was ‘irrelevant’ to Argentina’s claim to the islands.

An overwhelming yes: 98.8 per cent of eligible voters in the Falkland Islands voted to remain a part of Britain

She said: ‘It is a manoeuvre with no legal value, it has not been organised or supervised by the United Nations

'It is a referendum between British 
inhabitants, organised by the British, to say that they want the 
territory where they live to be British.’

In a virtually unanimous message of 
defiance to the Argentine government, 1,513 voted to remain under 
British rule, with just three - 0.2% - voting against the referendum 
question 'Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current 
political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?'

The Prime Minister said the 99.8% vote
in favour of remaining a British Overseas Territory in a referendum 
held on the islands over the past two days was the 'clearest possible 
result there could be'.

He said Britain would always be there 
to defend the islands. Speaking at 10 Downing Street just hours after 
the result of the referendum was announced, Mr Cameron said it sent a 
clear message to Argentina.

Although the result of the referendum 
was widely seen as a foregone conclusion, the landslide delivered a 
resounding message.

Nigel
Haywood, governor of the Falkland Islands, said the referendum was a 
'massive demonstration of the way the Falkland Islanders feel and of the
way they see their future'.

He
said: 'Obviously it is a major principle of the United Nations that a 
people have their right to self-determination, and you don't get a much 
clearer expression of the people's self-determination than such a large 
turn out and such a large yes vote.'

Following
the vote Mr Hague said: 'I welcome the result, which demonstrates more 
clearly than ever the Falkland Islanders' wish to remain an Overseas 
Territory of the United Kingdom.

'We
have always been clear that we believe in the rights of the Falklands 
people to determine their own futures and to decide on the path they 
wish to take. It is only right that, in the 21st century, these rights 
are respected.

'All 
countries should accept the results of this referendum and support the 
Falkland Islanders as they continue to develop their home and their 
economy. I wish them every success in doing so.'

Our Islands, our choice: Nearly all of the residents of the Falkland Islands voting in a referendum chose to remain a British overseas territory

The outcome of the two-day sovereignty referendum was punctuated by the over 90 percent high turn-out of patriotic islanders eager for their voices to be heard in the diplomatic row that has blown up more than three decades after British forces repelled an Argentinian attempt to seize the islands by force.

The residents voted by a huge majority to remain a British Overseas Territory, with a ballot box turnout exceeding 90 per cent of eligible voters.

Residents lined up for 30 minutes outside Port Stanley’s town hall waiting to cast their ballots yesterday amid a festive atmosphere that left the Falklands’ diminutive capital swathed in red, white and blue.

Posters bearing the slogan ‘Our Islands, Our Choice’ adorned windows throughout the town and the post office produced a line of official stamps to mark the occasion.

Voters turned up carrying Union Jacks on a procession of horses and in Land Rovers swamped in bunting.

Today the Prime Minister called the Chair of Falklands Legislative Assembly Gavin Short to congratulate him on the emphatic result. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'He also praised the way that the referendum had been carried out and said that he hoped that the outcome would be clearly recognised internationally.

'Mr Short agreed, thanking the Prime Minister for Britain's help and support. He said that the referendum had left a mark in the history books of the Falklands.

'The Prime Minister said that the Islanders should be very proud and promised to continue to support and promote the Falklands, wishing the Islanders the best for their future.'

In distant islands and far-flung sheep farms, ballot papers were being flown and driven in by mobile polling stations.

‘We hope those undecided, or those uninformed, or those countries that might otherwise be prepared to give the nod to Argentina’s sovereignty claim might have pause for thought after the referendum,’ said John Fowler, deputy editor of the islands’ weekly newspaper, the Penguin News.

‘This is an attempt to say “hang on a minute, there’s another side to the story”.

‘For me, this referendum is extremely important because I have no wish to be part of Argentina,’ said Rob McGill, 67, who runs a guesthouse in isolated Carcass Island and voted by post.

‘I consider myself a Falkland Islander, but my ancestors came from Britain,’ he added.

Some islanders are the descendants of British settlers who arrived eight or nine generations ago and the Falklands retain an unmistakably British character despite a sizeable community of immigrants from Chile and Saint Helena.

High turnout: The Falkland Islands referendum saw a turnout of more than 90 per cent of its eligible voters

Residents say fiery remarks by Argentine President Cristina Fernandez and her foreign minister, Hector Timerman, have galvanized patriotic sentiment on the islands, which lie nearly 8,000 miles from London and just a 75-minute flight away from southern Argentina.

Tensions have risen with the discovery of commercially viable oil resources in the Falklands basin and by Fernandez’s persistent demands for Britain to hold sovereignty talks over the Malvinas, as the islands are called in Spanish.

London says it will only agree to negotiations if the islanders want them, which they show no sign of doing.

Argentina has blasted the referendum as a ‘public-relations campaign’ and accused Britain of pursuing ‘irresponsible initiatives in bad faith.’

‘This new British attempt to manipulate the Malvinas issue through a vote by the population that it implanted is forcefully rejected by Argentina,’ a foreign ministry statement said, citing broad Latin American support for Argentina’s position.

Argentina says the sovereignty dispute can only be decided between London and Buenos Aires.

Argentina has claimed the islands since 1833, saying it inherited them from the Spanish on independence and that Britain expelled an Argentine population.

Its attempt to take the islands by force in April 1982, drew a swift response from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The 10-week war, which killed about 650 Argentines and 255 Britons, is widely remembered in Argentina as a humiliating mistake by the brutal and discredited dictatorship ruling at the time.

In the islands, where plans for oil production to start in 2017 could further boost the flourishing local economy, most residents are determined to maintain the status quo.

‘Our best-case scenario is for them to drop their claim and realize that we are a people, we are a country and we do exist,’ said Gavin Short, one of the Falklands assembly’s eight elected members.

Asked if he thought that might happen, he said: ‘Not in my lifetime.'
