Jailed: Darrel Bingham, 51, claimed his sadistic actions were inspired by Fifty Shades of Grey

A former soldier who blackmailed his young lover into depraved sex acts was inspired by Fifty Shades of Grey, he claims.

Darrell Bingham, 51, said the months of sadistic role play was the idea of his 21-year-old girlfriend, who saw herself as naive Anastasia Steele who is forcefully controlled by her older boyfriend as Christian Grey.

The best-selling 'mummy porn' novels, set to hit cinema screens next year, follow the affair of a couple who enjoy consensual, dominating sex.

For six months, Bingham, acting under two fake Facebook accounts, blackmailed his real-life girlfriend into performing sex acts over a web cam - posing as an American footballer called Grant and a man called Chad, Hull Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Joanne Kidd told the court: 'He played with her like a cat would a mouse.'

Bingham, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, threatened to post her naked pictures to her work colleagues if she disobeyed his other demands.

His demands escalated, culminating 
in a request to get the victim's 15-year-old sister involved.

Distraught, she broke down in tears at work. Colleagues called the 
police, who traced the online exchanges back to Bingham.

Bingham, who was originally found guilty after a first trial last year, told the appeal hearing it was simply role play to 'spice up' their relationship and that his then 21-year-old girlfriend knew Chad was him all along.

But the jury found Bingham guilty of all 
seven charges of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without 
consent. He was jailed for seven years.

Defending, Edward Bindloss 
said: 'If Christian, the character in the novel, was being done for 
assault, it wouldn't matter if it was a tap or much worse, getting viler
 and viler, if she was in on it.'

However, Ms Kidd said Bingham made up the fact it was role play after a successful appeal against his original conviction on a technicality and it was never mentioned in his original trial or in police interview.

Referring to Yahoo chat conversations between 'Chad' and the victim, Ms Kidd said: 'Do you consider they smack of some elaborate sexual role play to spice up the sex life? Or do you read the responses as those from a terrified young woman, being frightened to death?'

She told the jury he was clutching at straws and alarm bells should be ringing.

The court heard jealous Bingham created Grant to befriend the woman on Facebook in early 2010.

Posing as Grant, he pestered her for a topless photograph, which she sent. He then threatened her and made further demands.

Eventually, the woman confided in her boyfriend Bingham, a former soldier, not realising he was behind the threats. Telling her to carry on, he said he would go to meet 'Grant' in Pontefract to 'sort him out'.

Bingham then showed his girlfriend a Google image of a man tied up with a gun to his head, claiming he had murdered 'Grant' and she believed him.

Three weeks after 'Grant' was murdered, 'Chad' began messaging her and continued the blackmail, claiming 'Grant' had sent him the images of her.

Mr Bindloss said the woman had 'manipulated "Grant"' into meeting her so subsequent acts were consensual and claimed they created 'Chad' together following the 'excitement' of the previous alias.

But Ms Kidd said: 'He wanted to appear to be her knight in shining armour. His motivation was to plant himself so firmly in her life that she would love him and trust him. He manipulated her so she relied on him and only him.'

When she was told it was Bingham all along, the woman 'collapsed in hysterics'.

Ms Kidd said: 'It may be suggested, how could anyone believe Grant and Chad were real? But put that on its head.

'How can anyone believe a boyfriend could be so cruel and desperately manipulative to expose you to this sexual deprivation and humiliation?'
