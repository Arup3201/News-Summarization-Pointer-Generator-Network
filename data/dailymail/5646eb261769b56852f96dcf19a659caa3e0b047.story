A  shopkeeper facing energy bills of £5,000 hanged himself just moments after three British Gas staff turned up at his store to cut off the electricity supply, an inquest heard.

Anthony Waters, 48, was serving customers at his family run mini market in Little Horton, West Yorkshire, when the workmen arrived at 9am in a convoy of three vehicles with a warrant saying his shop was going to be 'de-energised'.

Despite his pleas that he could raise £1,000, one of the gasmen said it was not enough and then plunged the store into darkness after ignoring threats by Mr Waters that he would take his own life.

Shortly afterwards, as the workmen called police from outside to alert them about Mr Waters' claims, he closed the shop and hanged himself.

Today the energy giant was condemned by Mr Waters' family after a coroner said he had been 'put on the spot' by company staff.

The tragedy occurred in the same month that regulator Ofgem said the big six energy firms - including British Gas - were set to double profit margins over the next year.

Mr Waters' father Keith, 87, said: 'I think Anthony felt he had let us down. He was pushed to the point of desperation by a big corporation bullying him because it couldn't give a bit of leeway to a single man struggling and he was pushed over the edge. I think it is disgusting.

'I'm sure they could have arranged for another payment scheme if things were getting that bad. I don't understand why British Gas had to send three men to his shop without any warning. 

'It was a bit heavy-handed and these companies forget the human side of things. Where is their humanity?

'Since they switched off the electricity we have had row upon row of stock going to waste and to add insult to injury we've had two break-ins because the burglar alarm was rendered useless when the electricity was cut off.

'I know it must have been difficult for those three British Gas men and they were only doing their job but when Anthony said the words he did and stated his intention, why did no one take heed? Is money worth as much as a life?'

The inquest in Bradford heard a team of three British Gas employees, including a locksmith and engineer turned up on July 22 in a convoy of three vehicles at Mr Waters' mini market.

Warrant officer David Pickard, one of the British Gas team members, said in a statement: 'We attend residents and businesses who have not paid their bills. We either collect the outstanding debt or "de-energise" the electricity supply.

'I went into the shop and Mr Waters was serving customers. He confirmed he was Anthony Waters. I tried to explain why I was there but it was difficult because he was trying to serve customers. We began to talk inside the shop.

'I explained why we were there - if he did not pay there was a warrant and his supply would be de-energised.

'I spoke to a lady who had access to the computer and she confirmed that the debt was still outstanding. They give the final say on whether we de-energise or walk away. She confirmed we had to de-energise if the debt was not paid in full.

'He began to talk to them and then he handed the phone to me. I think he rang a close friend or relative to get money. He said he could get about £1,000 but I said that was not enough.

'He clearly felt he should have been given more time to pay. He said "You will have to do it," referring to us de-energising the electricity supply. 

'But he was getting more anxious and said "I will hang myself". I thought it was just a throw away comment, an idle threat. In my line of work I hear people say it quite regularly and think nothing of it.'

Mr Waters pulled the window shutters down and told staff to go home and told British Gas to "go ahead."

The inquest was told how he was then heard to repeat 'I will hang myself' before adding 'I have got the rope ready you know. I would have been 49 next month.'

Mr Pickard said: 'Again I just thought this was idle threats and trying to make us feel sorry for him so we would not go ahead. He kept trying to hurry us up saying "I want you to leave now". 

'His window shutters were down and the door inside was shut. I thought Mr Waters was still inside but I hadn't been able to watch the door while I was on the phone to the police.'

Police arrived and asked the British Gas locksmith to pick the lock to gain entry. Officers found Mr Waters' body in a warehouse at the back of the store. 

Mr Waters senior had set up Waters Mini-Mart in 1969 with a view to leaving it to his son. 

But the family ran into financial difficulties after building a large property portfolio on the back of a £300,000 bank loan. When  Anthony, who was single, took over this year, three of the businesses they ran had to temporarily shut down in an attempt to consolidate the debts.

The mini market reopened in February but hit difficulties when the bank called in the debts on the family's other business interests, the inquest heard.

Mr Waters said: 'Earlier this year we thought we were doing really nicely and that things were on the mend. Sales were going up, It was great and then suddenly the bank said three of our properties would have to be sold to pay for the others - and that's when it all started to go wrong.

'British Gas were already charging us thousands for the shop even though it had been shut down for a while. How they could have accumulated a bill like that when it was closed I don't know. 

'Anthony was paying his current British Gas bill so as far as we were concerned they had come around to collect money for a bill he shouldn't have been paying.'

Recording a verdict of suicide Bradford Coroner Oliver Longstaff said: 'There is considerable evidence in my mind that Anthony Waters was under a considerable amount of stress with the financial difficulties of the business.

'There is evidence that he was put on the spot by the British Gas officers. He closed the shop and sent people away. 

Anthony Waters (pictured with his mother Beryl and father Keith) had 'done his best for a long time to keep the family business', the coroner said

The family of Mr Waters say vandals targeted the shop in Little Horton, West Yorkshire, after the power was cut off

'He took himself to the rear of the building where he took his own life. There was no evidence that he was suffering from any psychological conditions or that his judgement was impaired by use of alcohol.

'He was a man who had done his best for a long time to keep the family business which he took great pride in, in good health for as long as he could. He realised he couldn't do that for any longer and took a view that all that was left was to end his life.'

After the case Leonie Edwards of British Gas said, 'We were very saddened by the death of Mr Waters and we would like to express our sincere sympathies to his family. 

'British Gas employees followed our established procedures and contacted the police when they were onsite and stayed there until they arrived.

'Disconnection is always a last resort and this usually follows a series of discussions including payment plans and support from organisations like Business Debtline to try and resolve the issue.'
