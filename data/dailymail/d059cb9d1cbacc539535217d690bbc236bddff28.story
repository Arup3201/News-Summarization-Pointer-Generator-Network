The Church of England’s official Twitter feed was branded ‘offensive’ yesterday after a quip about gay marriage and former glamour model Katie Price.

A user calling himself ‘Just Skippy’ began the exchange by sending a question to the Church’s Twitter account, @c_of_e.

He wrote: ‘Can I ask what @c_of_e thinks about Katie Price marrying for 3rd time making a mockery of marriage yet you are against Homosexual marriage.’

'Offensive': The Church of England replied to a tweet asking what it thought of Katie Price marrying for the first time

In response, the Church replied: ‘We don’t have an official policy on Katie Price. Having said that, Jordan gets quite a few mentions in the Old Testament’ - a reference to the reality star’s name in her glamour modelling days.

While some readers were amused by the unexpectedly light-hearted quip, others took offence - illustrating the pitfalls of trying to communicate to the world in just 140 characters.

In fact what followed was an object lesson in the point made by the account’s strapline: ‘We’re here to learn and to engage with the Twitter community and talk about some of the work we do.’

‘Just Skippy’ - whose profile adds ‘It’s me, Chris’ and describes himself as a ‘39-year-old sort of builder from Birmingham’ - was initially positive, tweeting: ‘Oh that has made me laugh, I could almost forgive you on your stance on gay marriage but I won’t.’

Ministers have unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following a legal ban on same-sex weddings in the Church of England

Joining in Sunday’s exchange, fellow users pointed out that Miss Price - who last week wed builder and part-time stripper Kieran Hayler, 25, in the Caribbean - would not have been allowed to remarry in most C of E churches anyway.

Apparently recognising that offence had been caused, the Church’s Twitter feed then posted to Just Skippy: ‘Glad we could be source of joy as well as - sadly - disquiet for you. Blessings.’

The Church of England’s @c_of_e account has just over 21,000 followers - somewhat fewer than the 1.4million attracted to Pope Benedict XVI’s @pontifex English language account in just over a month.

Last month Coalition ministers unveiled plans to legalise gay marriage following an unexpected legal ban on same-sex weddings in the Church of England - an arrangement that failed to satisfy either gay rights groups or traditionalist clergy.
