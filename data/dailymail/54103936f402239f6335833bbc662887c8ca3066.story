Colombia star James Rodriguez left the World Cup with six goals, a heavy heart and one unusual companion on his arm.

Rodriguez threw his side a lifeline late in the semi-final defeat by Brazil when he scored a penalty and celebrated the strike unaware a huge green insect was hitching a ride on his arm.

The Monaco playmaker was crying at the end of the match in Fortaleza but the tears had nothing to do with his new sidekick.

Brazil had just ended the Colombians' hopes of victory through an early striker from captain Thiago Silva and a stunning free-kick from David Luiz.

Rodriguez leads the tournament scoring charts on his own after hitting the target in all five of his side's matches. His closest challenges are Brazilian Neymar and Argentina superstar Lionel Messi, who are both two behind on four.

Colombia's main man is in good company following his brush with the Fortaleza pitch invader. Paul McCartney was joined on stage by a few of them last May when he performed in Brazil.
