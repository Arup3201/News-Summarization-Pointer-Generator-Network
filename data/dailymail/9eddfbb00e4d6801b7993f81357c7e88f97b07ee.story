Disgusted: Ari Teman says that he discovered that his Manhattan apartment had been used to host an orgy after he interrupted the man who was organizing it

A New York comedian got an unwelcome shock on Friday when he discovered he had unwittingly rented out his apartment for an orgy.

Ari Teman advertized his Manhattan apartment on Airbnb and was contacted by a man named David who said he wanted a place for his family to stay while he attended a wedding in the city.

However, after handing over the keys to David during the afternoon, Teman realized he had forgotten a bag and went back to his apartment at 11.30 pm where he found the aftermath of an 'XXX Freak Fest' orgy that had taken place all over his home.

According to Teman, when he returned to his apartment building he saw David in the lobby and heard him saying, 'they're shutting us down.'

Asking David what that meant, Teman claims that that he look on in horror as the saw David total panic about his return.

Rushing to his apartment to see it in a state of disarray, he googled David's telephone number to see what came up.

The orgy, which was billed online as a 'BBW Panty Raid Party' advertized a cellphone number which matched the one provided by David in his AirBNB profile.

Investigating further, Teman discovered the Twitter feed of @TWINN_GREEN, who was advertising a 'XXX Freak Fest' on Friday night at the location of Teman's building.

Apartment on Airbnb: This is the frontage of Ari Teman's Manhattan apartment that was used to host a sex orgy on Friday night

Teman furiously ejected David from his home and is now claiming damages from Airbnb of $67,076 from the party and is fearful that his landlord will evict him.

Indeed, David was listed as a verified member of the popular renting website and his profile contained multiple reviews - all positive.

However, Teman says that among the damaged items were a broken sofa, bed, torn lamp, coffee table, drum set and his Fender guitar.

Also, all of Teman's clothes were mysteriously damp, which caused an outraged Teman to write a Tumblr post about his woes, saying, 'I don't even want to know how it's wet.'

Investigation: When Teman realized what had happened in his apartment he Googled David's telephone number and discovered this tweet

There were also condoms and liquor left lying around and Teman is claiming he is so embarrassed he can't look other tenants in the eye.

'I enjoy a 'Festival' as much as the next fellow, but this is a family building and some people don’t enjoy having their neighbor’s worldly possessions tossed in a pile into the common area, while a group of strangers form a pile to have their private areas tossed. As such, I’m going to be evicted.'

Police from the NYPD's 10th precinct were eventually called to clear the apartment.

Phoning the telephone number listed online, Gawker said they spoke to David who insisted he did nothing wrong, that there was no party and that Teman has said that he could have up to 50 guests to the apartment.

Anger: When Ari realized what had occurred he instantly demanded an explanation from Airbnb

Prompt response: Airbnb have moved quickly to address Teman's issues with his apartment and their verification process

Teman disputes all of this and sent Airbnb a furious tweet - to which they responded very quickly.

He was sent $23,817 and the company paid for someone to come over and change his locks.

'AirBNB has been in contact every day. Their staff has been helpful,' Teman told Gothamist.

'AirBNB is putting me in a hotel for a week.'

The dispute between David and Teman is currently in the hands of their lawyers and AirBnB made this statement:

'Over 11 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are incredibly rare, but when they happen, we try to help make things right.

'We were appalled when we learned about this incident and we took immediate action to help this host.

'The individual who rented this space has been permanently removed from our site. We've reimbursed the host for damages to his apartment and ensured he has a new place to stay.

'In the days ahead, we'll continue to work with the host to assist him with his additional needs and we will work cooperatively with any law enforcement agencies that investigate this matter.'
