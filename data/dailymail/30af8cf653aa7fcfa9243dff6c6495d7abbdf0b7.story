Violent killings: Aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, from Surrey, and his family may have been the victims of a 'lone psychopath'

A British engineer and his family brutally murdered in the French Alps were likely to have been the victims of a random, deranged killer, investigators have said.

Baffled officials investigating the deaths of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal, her mother Suhaila al-Hilli, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, are yet to uncover a motive for the shootings in September.

While previous lines of inquiry have ranged from a contract killing to a family feud, the prosecutor leading the probe has now said it is suspected the killings were the work of a lone, crazed gunman.

Eric Maillaud, who said all lines of inquiry remain open, said investigators were looking for 'unbalanced people - capable of extreme violence'.

Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife Iqbal, his 74-year-old mother-in-law and cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, were killed when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated layby close to the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy.

Mr al-Hilli's daughters Zainab and Zeena survived the shooting in September.

There was no DNA at the scene, but shell casings from the weapon suggest the gun used was an antique Luger, of the type issued to the Swiss army before the First World War.

A collector's item, a Luger is unlikely to be the weapon of choice for a contract killer, experts have said.

'If it was done on a contract it was very badly done,' Mr Mailaud told the BBC. He did not comment on the weapon used.

He said police were looking for people who had access to guns, such as hunters, collectors or members of shooting clubs - in particular those with psychiatric problems.

'Without doubt we are looking for someone who has killed before, someone who puts no value on human life,' he said.

At one point investigators were looking into whether cyclist Mr Mollier was the target, but the theory has now been all but ruled out.

Officers are still looking into the 
possibility that Mr al-Hilli was involved in a serious financial 
dispute with his brother, Zaid, over a family will.

There were even claims in Le Monde 
that former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had paid Â£840,000 into a
Swiss Bank account set up in the businessman's name - however these were later denied by the French police.

The al-Hilli are originally from Baghdad, having moved to Britain in 1971.

Mr Maillaud said last month that the theory a lone and psychologically disturbed killer was behind the murders was 'gaining ground'.

Mr Maillaud confirmed at the time that the French
cyclist had at more bullets in his body than any other victim. There 
have also been reports that he was shot first.

A source told Le Monde: 'The theory of a 
family feud is being pushed aside by investigators, who are now looking 
at the possibility of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer.

'They
have carried out checks at all psychiatric hospitals in the region and 
are tracking down all patients who may have been recently released or 
were on day release.

'They are especially focusing those with previous convictions for gun violence or who were known to be attracted to firearms.

'Investigators
are on this basis also contacting gun clubs and hunting clubs in the 
region. But so far they have had no satisfactory results to their 
inquiries.'

The prosecutor has previously described the huge challenge facing officials investigating the complex case.

'It's a long task and there's nothing that gives hope of a result in the near future,' he said.

'We're investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time, trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died, trying to understand a real motive for these killings.

'Perhaps if we can understand why they were killed we can work out who killed them but at the moment there are many questions.

'I think the investigation will take a very, very long time, unless we discover something that will suddenly enable us to understand everything.

'There are lines of inquiry but each raises so many questions and nothing suggests there will be a quick solution.'
