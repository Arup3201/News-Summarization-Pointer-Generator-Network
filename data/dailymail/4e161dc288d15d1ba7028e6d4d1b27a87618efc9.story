At least 32 people were killed in a stampede during a Hindu festival in the eastern Indian state of Bihar today.

A huge crowd had gathered at an outdoor venue in the state capital Patna for the burning of effigies at dusk, part of the Dussehra festival.

Witnesses say the stampede started at the end of the event, when two people spread a rumour that an electrical wire had snapped and fallen to the ground, inciting panic.

This has not been confirmed by police, who are examining CCTV pictures to determine what triggered the incident.

Of those killed, around 25 are believed to be women, and around five are children. In addition to the dead, at least 15 people were taken to hospital, the police chief, P.K. Thakur said.

Officials said the stampede happened as people were leaving. Television channels quoted a witness as saying there were not enough lights once the ceremony was over.

NDTV reports that not all the gates at the venue were open for those trying to leave.

People fainted in the crush, officials said, and had to be taken to the Patna Medical College Hospital two kilometres away.

The incident happened on the narrow Exhibition Road near the Ghandi Maidan - this is where the biggest Dussehra celebrations in Patna take place - with around 50,000 people turning up to watch the effigies burn.

The festival is celebrated on the tenth day of the month of Ashwin in the Hindu lunisolar calendar, with the previous nine days known as Maha Navratri

The effigies are filled with firecrackers which contain phosphorous - a chemical which they believe purifies the atmosphere to combat illnesses onset by the drop in temperate at the time of year

Dussehra, also known as Vijayadashami, is one of the most important Hindu festivals, and marks Lord Rama's defeat of the ten-headed demon king Ravana and also Goddess Durga's of the demon Mahishasur.

It is celebrated on the tenth day of the month of Ashwin in the Hindu lunisolar calendar, with the previous nine days known as Maha Navratri.

The festival is celebrated in different ways across India, as well as in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. In Bihar, there are plays, music and parades, before the effigies of Ravana are burnt on bonfires in the evening.

These effigies are filled with firecrackers which contain phosphorous - a chemical which they believe purifies the atmosphere to combat illnesses onset by the drop in temperate at the time of year.
