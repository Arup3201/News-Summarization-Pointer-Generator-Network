Former Barcelona defender Eric Abidal has insisted Real Madrid's most important player is not Cristiano Ronaldo but Karim Benzema.

Ronaldo has 30 goals in La Liga compared to Benzema's 13, but former France international Abidal reckons his compatriot is the more desirable player to have in a team.

'Benzema is the man I'd sign from Madrid if I were at Barca because for me he is Madrid's most important player right now,' Abidal told Gol TV.

'If you take Benzema away from Real Madrid then they would continue scoring goals but not as many as they do with Karim in the team. 

'He's a very complete player and other players [play] well in Madrid when Karim is there.

'So yes, if I have to sign one person it would be him, and not just because he is my friend and my compatriot but because of his qualities.'

Abidal left Barcelona in 2013 and feels his former club will prove too strong for their Madrid rivals.

He continued: 'I think it will finish 3-1 to Barca. I think Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez will each score, though I'd like Javier Mascherano to get a goal for the club.

'Barca are doing much better than at the start of the season, when they struggled a little bit. Now, in 2015, everything's looking impressive and hopefully that continues until the end of the season.'
