A Massachusetts mother found herself without propane to heat her family's home on Christmas day and reached out to her local community for help.

The overwhelming support Danielle Ryder of Brewster received after creating a charity page amazed the married mother of two young children.

Ryder wrote on her Go Fund Me page that she and her husband both work long hours to support themselves and their two-year-old daughter and four-year-old son.

Young family: Both Ryder and her husband work long hours but often find it difficult to make ends meet

Cold comfort: 61 people have donated $1,995 to Ryder and her family so they can afford to heat their home

She said that between Christmas expenses, rent, food, gas for her car and health insurance, her 'take-home pay is minimal.'

Her husband runs a flooring and construction business, but during winter work can be sporadic.

Car troubles before Christmas cleaned the family out, so when their AmeriGas propane tank emptied, they faced a very cold Christmas.

Ryder explained that the family's propane woes began the year before, when they ran out of propane. The company delivered propane after two chilly weeks, but it came with extra fees.'The company finally delivered to us after charging a "transfer fee" among "emergency relief" and "restarting"... we did not have the money to afford it then. We got help from local organizations to cover the down payment. We were to be put on budget billing. We never received a bill. When AmeriGas finally called us about our account, our account was in collection,' she wrote.

Sleepless: Ryder wrote that she has been unable to sleep or even smile for worry about how to keep her children warm without using dangerous space heaters

Now that the tank is once again empty, the company refused to refill the family's propane until their original bill was paid, in addition to the cost of the new one: a total of $2300.

'I have $40 in the bank. I have a $20 bill in my pocket to dump into my gas tank to get to work tomorrow night..to make $60.00 to buy food for my children to eat. I go countless nights without eating, sleeping, or smiling,' wrote Ryder.

Desperate times: Danielle Ryder reached out for help and was overwhelmed by the generosity of her community

Just two days after her heartfelt plea, Ryder is more than halfway to her goal of $2300, having raised $1,990 from 61 separate donations.She also got in touch with the powers that be at AmeriGas to express her dissatisfaction with the service she received from her local office. 'Last year we were told we would be put on budget billing but that the local office had no faith in us.. this was told to a local company helping us pay after two weeks of no heat or hot water with a 1 year old and a 3 year old. We then never received a payment plan contract, bill, no contacts were made. This same woman is now demanding all our past due amount plus this entire new delivery UPFRONT cost,' she said.

Earlier Friday Ryder posted an ecstatic update: 'I'M GETTING FUEL TODAY!!!' she wrote.Ryder
hadÂ  managed to speak to the corporate CEO of AmeriGas and demanded 
emergency assistance. In exchange, she will pay the initial $860.58 due 
from last year and be put on a payment plan for the remaining $1304.38.

'To the woman in the local office... I will no longer be dealing with you. Your boss is clearly upset with your service and floored by our community action to support my family. You were officially reported to your corporate CEO and a complaint filed against you,' she wrote.'I can't begin to thank each and everyone of you who shared, reached out and helped me. In less than 24 hours, with lots of support and donations, I have heat and hot water back. YOU ARE ALL AMAZING. I don't even know where to begin to pay it forward.'
