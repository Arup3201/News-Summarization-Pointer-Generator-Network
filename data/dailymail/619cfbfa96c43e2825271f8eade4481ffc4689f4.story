The U.S. Navy’s standard-issue blue digitized camouflage fatigues are highly flammable and will burn ‘robustly until complete consumption,’ a report revealed last month. 

The findings show that the digital-print camo, which is made from 50 percent cotton and 50 percent nylon, will drip as it burns, causing potentially hazardous burn injuries.

But the Navy’s top spokesman said that the government organization is aware of the report findings, and added that sailors had asked for a fade-resistant uniform that was also comfortable.

Danger zone? The Navy Type I blue and grey fatigues were found to by highly flammable and would drip and melt onto skin if ignited

Test zone: An impromptu test conducted on October 15 revealed that the new nylon-cotton uniform was highly flammable; according to the report, the material melts and drips as it burns

Safety first: Rear Adm. John Kirby, the chief of information at the Pentagon and spokesman for the Navy, said in a video published last month that the uniform was found to 'burn robustly until complete consumption'

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the chief of information at the Pentagon and spokesman for the Navy, said in a video published last month that while the uniform was found to ‘burn robustly until complete consumption,’ it’s not shocking.

‘That is not a huge surprise because it’s a 50 percent nylon uniform,’ he said, but added that it wasn’t a requirement for the military-issue uniform to be at all flame resistant.

The impromptu test was conducted on October 15 by the Navy Clothing Textile Research Facility, located in Natick, Massachusetts.

In the test, a strip of the new nylon-cotton blend uniform was exposed to a flame for 12 seconds. The cloth immediately lit up in flames, and continued to burn after the fire source was removed, the report said.

According to the report, the material melts and drips as it burns, contributing to an increased risk of burn injury.

Adm. Kirby told the Virginian-Pilot that the camouflage, known as the Navy’s Type I NWU, was designed with sailors in mind.

Blend: The digitized print is made from a 50/50 nylon-cotton blend that is wrinkle-resistant

Ashes: Compared to other Navy uniforms, the 12-inch strip of NWU I fabric was totally consumed when exposed to flame

He said that Navy workers wanted a uniform ‘that was comfortable, that didn’t require maintenance, and would stand up under a lot of washing.’

The admiral added that a nylon-cotton blend was a good way of getting the type of garment these sailors wanted that would also meet their needs.

According to the Pilot, there is plenty of flame-retardant gear located throughout every Navy ship, meaning that the standard-issue uniforms need not be flame resistant.

Fire: While serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other Navy ships are uncommon, they do happen. In 1967, the U.S.S. Forrestal ignited after a series of explosions; 134 sailors were killed

Additionally, Adm. Kirby said in a statement that ‘the safety of our sailors, both afloat and ashore, remains a paramount concern. Nothing changes about that. And nothing changes about the wear of the NWU Type I aboard ship or installations.’

An editorial in the Navy Times estimated that it could cost as much as $20million to gradually phase-in a fire-retardant uniform, but noted that most sailors would ‘gladly pay an extra $50 per set to know that their uniforms will protect them if their ship ever catches fire.’

While serious fires aboard aircraft carriers and other Navy ships are uncommon, they do happen. In 1967, the U.S.S. Forrestal ignited after a series of explosions. 

In total, 134 sailors were killed.

The NWU Type I was introduced in 2009.
