A  fraudster who won a contract from New York City to clean up after Ebola grossly exaggerated his experience after 'scamming' the grieving relatives of a haz-mat expert, a new report claims.

Salvatore Pane, 32, the chief safety officer of Bio Recovery corporation, was called in when Dr Craig Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola to eradicate the disease from places he'd been.

Photographs of him taping perimeters around Spencer's Harlem apartment, handling barrels of waste and speaking to news crews were beamed around the world, while in interviews he boasted of having 27 years' experience and took credit for cleaning up after anthrax attacks in the wake of 9/11.

Riding to the rescue: Pane appeared on television and radio interviews in the wake of the cleanup, and his image was beamed across the world. Bio Recovery, the company he is associated with, has not been given any work by New York City since Pane's past emerged

In front of camera, behind bars: In 2010/11 Pane was serving jail time for drunk driving. He was also fined in connection a company which took advantage of people struggling with mortgages in the Credit Crunch

But, according to an investigation by BuzzFeed News, Pane has a criminal history, a track record of exaggerating credentials, and during the clean-up was using vehicles and permits registered to a dead man, whose family now feel 'scammed'.

On October 24, the day after Dr Spencer was diagnosed with Ebola, Pane was on the scene at his West 147th Street home, and also at The Gutter bowling alley in Williamsburg, where Spencer visited the night before.

He gave interviews to TV news explaining his work, and went out of his way to bring up how 'we' cleaned up after an Anthrax attack in 2001, the week after 9/11.

But shortly after his heroic turn, BuzzFeed News published an exposé, revealing that in 2008 he had been president of a company that claimed to helped customers trapped by distressed mortgages, and fleeced them of their fees.

An injunction was issued against Pane's businesses and he himself was fined. It was also revealed that Pane had served time in jail for driving while drunk - even getting himself re-arrested outside a courthouse after driving himself to the case while his licence. 

In the wake of the revelation, City Hall officials in New York distances themselves from Pane and Bio Recovery, and said he would be getting no more work from them.

There is no suggestion that Pane - who changed his name to Pain after getting out of jail in March 2011 - did not complete the Ebola clean-up properly.

But now more detail has emerged about how Pane came to be in a position to be entrusted with defending New Yorkers from a potential pandemic.

City Hall has said that Bio Recovery had been doing jobs for them on and off over the past six years - when the company was founded by former paramedic Ron Gospodarski in 1998.

Gospodarski ran the reputable company until he got sick 2013 and died. In his will he left the company to Fran Gospodarski Senko, his sister.

Gospodarski Senko told BuzzFeed how Pane called her out of the blue months after her brother died, claiming to be a business associate.

He asked for passwords to accounts -and negotiated buying an ambulance and a box truck he had used, which featured haz-mat permits which he claimed were almost identical to his own.

He later followed up by asking her sell him the company itself, to save on costly bureaucracy and administration.

Gospodarski Senko recalled him saying: 'If you just sign the corporation over, it'll save me money.'

Although no official records show Pane as the owner, former employees claim he was clearly the boss, and said that he deliberately kept his name off any official records because of his past.

Nonetheless, he went on to continue Bio Recovery's line of work, and boasted in interviews of having '27 year's experience' - which would have meant his bio hazard career began aged four.

Employees and associates of Gospodarski all say they had never heard of Pane until recently.

After seeing Pane claim credit for the company her brother built, Gospodarski Senko said she felt 'stupid' for trusting him.

She told BuzzFeed: 'I can't even grieve for my brother,' she said, 'and he's out there pulling my corporation from underneath my nose.... When you get scammed like this, I mean - I can't believe it.'

In response to previous allegations, Pane had said: 'I hope I’ve done what I’ve had to do to rebuild my life. I’m not a bad guy.'

But he declined to comment in detail on the latest revelations, and told reporters who contacted him to 'grow up'.
