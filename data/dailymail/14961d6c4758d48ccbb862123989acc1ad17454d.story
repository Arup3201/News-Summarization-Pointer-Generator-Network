Diana Dors' youngest son has revealed how he took drugs at the age five and glimpsed orgies by the age of 11 thanks to the party lifestyle of his world famous mother.

Jason Dors-Lake, now 43, has written a tell-all book with Niema Ash where he reveals what it's like to grow up the child of a Hollywood legend.

After two failed marriages, Diana had Jason with the love of her life, actor Alan Lake, who she met in her late thirties.

She already had two sons from her second marriage, who lived with their father Richard Dawson, and a reputation for being an insatiable party animal.

The sexual orgies she witnessed with her first husband Dennis Hamilton had become legendary.

As Niema writes in Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors: 'Dennis was a renowned host and 
some of his parties were infamous, rivalling those of the later-day 
notorious madam, Cynthia Payne.'

She describes how at Dennis' parties, 'the guests, mostly male, were ushered into a dimly lit room.

'Alcohol, erotic stimulants, willing starlets and exotic dancers 
contributed to a sexually charged atmosphere. The music throbbed, the 
dancing bordered on foreplay and inhibitions were suspended.

'As intimacy
developed into arousal, each couple was led to a special room and 
allocated fifteen minutes, unaware that the room was fitted with two-way
mirrors and their performance was a source of entertainment for select 
guests.'

She said Diana found this 'lots of fun' and when she later married Alan, whose work included porn films, she didn't want this fun to stop.

Niema writes that even the arrival of Jason, who she doted on, didn't sway her.

'Now with a new baby, unlimited motherhood had a second chance. But Diana was reluctant to renounce the parties, the clubs, the fun. She wanted to keep the good times rolling, especially as she could now share them with Alan,' she writes.

As a result, Diana and Alan's mansion, Orchard Manor in Sunningdale, Berkshire, became a regular haunt for wild parties.

'The parties resumed their ‘talk-of-the-town’ reputation from the Dennis days, but featured a quality of risquéness which left Dennis’s two-way mirrors back in the dark ages,' Niema writes.

Elaborating on this point in an interview with MailOnline, Niema said the two-way mirrors had become a thing of the past thanks to new technology.

She said: 'Jason recalls sex parties at the house where couples were invited to use the guest bedrooms where a camera was set up inside. A live feed then linked to a giant TV screen in the living room downstairs.'

Niema said Jason remembers being as young as 11 when he first glimpsed such sexual liaisons taking place in his home.

His introduction to drugs was even younger.

'At the tender age of five, Jason’s nursery education was supplemented by an introduction to the joys of recreational drugs,' Niema writes.

In the book she recounts an experience Jason shared when he was awoken from his bed as a five year old to hear a party taking place. He stumbled into a room to find his father's friends passing around what looked like 'a giant white jelly bean' that they cracked open to inhale a white smoke.

The youngster insisted on trying the 'candy'. After initial reservations, the party decided to let Jason sniff it 'for fun' as long as he promised not to tell his mother. Today, he has no idea what he took but recalls 'laughing until his tummy ached' after inhaling it.

The book goes on to relate how Jason then became accustomed to cannabis by the age of 11 as his alcoholic father, who Niema said seemed to see Jason more 'as his buddy than his son', decided it was 'better he does it among friends than strangers'.

Despite his unusual upbringing, Jason said he has happy childhood memories of his time at Orchard Manor and he never doubted the love his doting mother and father. Niema said he was the 'apple of their eyes' and their love and admiration for him was 'overflowing'.

But after growing up believing hosting sex and drug-fuelled parties was 'normal' behaviour for a family, it is perhaps no surprise he became an alcoholic and drug addict by this twenties.

His acceleration off the rails came with the tragic loss of his parents when he was just 14 - Diana died of ovarian cancer when she was 53 and a heartbroken Alan shot himself five months later.

Orphaned Jason went to live in the U.S. with his half brothers and the party lifestyle he had become accustomed to continued. He had a daughter when he was 22 and attempted suicide during one drug-induced episode.

However, Niema said Jason now has his life back on track. Living in Kent, he has reestablished his relationship with his daughter and attends AA meetings. He also runs a small business selling Diana Dors merchandise to his mother's still numerous fans.

The book on his mother, published by Purple Inc Press, describes how the 'seemingly unexceptional eight year old girl' from Swindon 'with unexceptional parents' became the 'UK's most famous film star, and, indeed, a living legend'.

Her beauty and sex appeal were evident since she starred in her first beauty pageant and by the time she was a teenager, she was in demand as an actress.

In the book, Jason shares many never before seen pictures of his parents, some of which you can view here.
