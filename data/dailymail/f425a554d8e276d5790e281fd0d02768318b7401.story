Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip looked happy and relaxed as they greeted well-wishers after church near their Norfolk home today.

Wearing a pale pink tweed coat with a natty matching hat decorated with fabric flowers and a pink ribbon, the Queen spoke to fellow church-goers and even accepted a bunch of tulips from one woman.

The royal wrapped up against the cold in a blush floral-print silk scarf and black gloves, while the Duke of Edinburgh wore his trademark long brown wool coat.

She greeted well-wishers and accepted numerous bunches of flowers from fellow church-goers

The Queen seemed in lively spirits, opting to walk and talk to her subjects outside the church of St Peter and St Paul in West Newton, in the heart of the Sandringham estate. 

Fellow church-goers offered her bouquets of flowers, which a helpful royal aide held in her arms to give the monarch a free hand. 

Despite the chilly Norfolk weather, the Queen provided a splash of colour and she accessorised her elegant tailored coat with pearl earrings and an amethyst and pearl flower brooch.

Braving a sleet flurry, the Queen took a stroll around the church grounds. 

While usually the Queen and Prince Philip attend Sunday service at the nearby St Mary Magdalene Church, on February 1, the royals instead visited St Peter and St Paul in West Newton, Sandringham.

They have been staying at their 20,000-acre East Anglian home since the Christmas break.

The Queen talked to the Reverend Canon Jonathan Riviere, who took the service in the Sandringham church. 

Last week, Prince Philip attended weekly service at St Mary Magdalene church with a noticeable cut on his left ear. This week the injury was clearly healing but he sported a scab.

Fortunately, he did not appear to be bothered by the small injury and escorted the Queen to and from the church. 

The Queen was in high spirits for her regular Sunday service, where she wore an eye-catching flower brooch

The Duke seemed to be wearing a playful tie printed with images of bookshelves laden with tomes, along with a grey suit and white shirt. 

Both the 83-year-old Prince and the Queen have been enjoying the winter break, having reduced the number of formal engagements she makes recently.

They are expected to return from their private royal estate in Norfolk to London around  6 February, which marks the anniversary of Her Majesty taking the throne.
