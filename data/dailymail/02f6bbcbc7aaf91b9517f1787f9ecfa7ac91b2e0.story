Children at a Jewish primary school have told of their terror at being threatened in the street as fears grow of another Paris-style Jihadist attack.

Teachers have stepped up security measures after pupils aged ten were told they would be ‘beaten up’ during a school trip.

Now children at the North London school are practising how to hide under their desks if a terrorist breaks into their classroom and opens fire.

The drill, called ‘sleeping lions’ shows the children how to cover their heads with their hands and remain silent so as not to give away their hiding place.

The school has also installed CCTV and drafted in police to give training to staff on what to do if a gunman storms the building.

The primary, which is not being named for security reasons, said the new measures were necessary in the wake of the terrorist atrocities in France.

And the head teacher said that other Jewish schools were adopting similar plans after being contacted by worried parents.

A school leader who asked to be known simply as Rabbi Jacob told the Daily Mail: ‘There have been two incidents of verbal abuse in the last year.

‘That’s what brought me to understand that we might now be living in a different environment compared with previous years.

‘The fear is that those people who are making nasty comments might decide to take it one step further and harm a child.’

The Rabbi said teachers were shocked when several 10-year-old pupils were targeted while on a school trip in July.

A group of men in their early 20s approached the children and told them they would be ‘beaten up’ unless Israel freed Palestine.

In October, antisemitic abuse was shouted at an 11-year-old boy while he rode the tube to school.

In the wake of the incidents, children have been ordered to wear baseball caps rather than their traditional skullcaps so that they cannot be identified as Jewish.

The primary school, which is not being named for security reasons, said the new measures were necessary in the wake of the terrorist atrocitiy at a Kosher deli in Paris earlier this month when four hostages were killed

He added: ‘The children didn’t even understand why they were being shouted at. They’re too young to know about the politics of the Middle East. It was very sad.

‘The fact that someone feels that they have the right to treat a 10-year-old like that is appalling.

‘The idea that every Jew in the world should be responsible for the Middle East is outrageous.

‘Some of the older children are upset about not wearing their skullcaps. They’ve been brought up to be proud of who they are.

‘But we don’t want to take any risks when it comes to their safety.’

One of the pupils told BBC Radio 4: ‘Sometimes I’m very worried about the current situation because after Paris, it could happen to England.’

It comes after four Jewish hostages were killed by Amedy Coulibaly when he targeted a kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this month.

Reports claimed that Coulibaly’s intended target had been a Jewish school in the south of Paris.

Security agencies on both sides of the Channel warned this week that future attacks were ‘highly likely’.

Many Jewish schools in the UK already have robust security thanks to around £1.6 million a year in contributions from parents to help keep pupils safe.

The Government contributes £2 million per year towards security, while the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors anti-Semitism in Britain, adds about £500,000 each year.

A CST spokesman said: ‘We spend an inordinate amount of money on security, particularly on our schools – as we should.

‘Obviously there’s a change in the threat level [after last week’s attacks] as there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen.’

In France, 5,000 police officers and army troops have already been stationed outside Jewish schools.

Although its figures will not be released until next month, the CST has predicted that the number of anti-Semitic attacks in 2014 will be the highest recorded in the past 30 years in the UK.

Earlier this week, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said she was ‘open to conversations’ about toughening up security at Jewish schools amid heightened fear of a terror attack.

She said: ‘I think it is truly shocking as the Home Secretary said today that in our lifetimes we are seeing a rise of anti-Semitism in this country and in particular in relation to my role in Government that Jewish schools are having to worry ever more about their security.’

Describing the new drill, one child told BBC Radio 4: ‘When an alarm goes off we do a thing called sleeping lions.

‘We all go under our desks and cover our heads with our hands.

‘Luckily it hasn’t been real yet.’

Another said: ‘You always feel like you have to pretend it’s a real situation and be as silent as possible even though you probably know that there’s no-one there. It’s very important.

‘You know that you are Jewish and lots of people don’t respect that.’
