Spelling out his nickname in cocaine, this boastful photograph helped expose a drug smuggler as being part of a huge international criminal gang uncovered by police.

Wayne Braund, 31, was snorting the drug with friends when he used his bank card to line up the white powder to say ‘Braundy’ for the camera, in a picture found on his mobile phone by officers.

The 10-man team operating out of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, had imported £4.5million worth of ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine and cannabis into Britain disguised as tinned fruit and tomatoes.

Other pictures showed one of the 
accomplices of Braund - an assistant to the drugs gang’s bosses - 
smiling inside a cannabis factory whilst a third showed lines of cocaine
 next to a rolled-up €500 note.

The
 gang bought drugs wholesale from underworld contacts in Holland and 
shipped into the UK on pallets, before they were sold onto crime gangs 
in Liverpool, Leeds, London and Glasgow.

The
 gang - jailed for a total of 92 and a half years - prided themselves on being ‘untraceable’ by regularly switching 
pay-as-you-go mobile phones and deleting data including photographs.

But
 Braund, of Rochdale, admitted conspiracy to import and supply drugs and
 was jailed for nine and a half years last Friday at Minshull Street 
Crown Court in central Manchester.

Cannabis resin: The 10-man team operating out of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, had imported £4.5million worth of ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine and cannabis into Britain disguised as tinned fruit and tomatoes

His boss Jason Seale, 45, from Bacup, 
Lancashire, who was the leader of the gang, also admitted conspiracy and
 was jailed for 14 years.

Six
 other Britons all from Rochdale and two Dutchmen - one a friend of the 
infamous drugs gangster Curtis Warren - were jailed for a total of 69 
years after admitting drug offences.

The court heard the gang had one of the most powerful drugs operations in the North of England.

Company
 director Seale set it up after being freed from a nine-year jail term 
having been convicted in 2004 of trying to import cannabis into Britain 
via the island of Guernsey on board a private yacht.

Bagged up: The gang bought drugs wholesale from underworld contacts in Holland and shipped into the UK on pallets, before they were sold onto crime gangs in Liverpool, Leeds, London and Glasgow

Communications: The gang prided themselves on being 'untraceable' by regularly switching pay-as-you-go mobile phones and deleting data including photographs

In the latest racket Seale sourced his
 drugs from two contacts he met in Amsterdam and had them packed into 
boxes which claimed to be various kinds of tinned fruit and vegetables.

'They used many code names: “paper” for money, “jacket” for cannabis and “trainers or roadrunners” for amphetamines'

Gary Woodhall, prosecuting

Police
 acting on a tip off intercepted a shipment of the drugs in December 
2011 but the gang carried on importing more narcotics into the UK.

Seale
 was planning to manufacture drugs in a Dutch laboratory before shipping
 them to the UK - unaware his gold S-type Jaguar had been bugged by 
detectives.

‘This group was
 in the business of commercial drug dealing and supplying to other 
criminal groups including Scotland,’ said Gary Woodhall, prosecuting.

‘They established a professional, 
sophisticated, well planned business. The group sought to avoid 
detection by limiting the use of phones and regularly switched 
telephones.

Cannabis cultivation: Dutchman Edwin Gorlee, 47, was jailed for eight and ten years respectively

‘They deleted data and had business or “dirty” phones, pay-as-you-go. They used BlackBerry Messenger where it is encrypted and uses the internet rather than the network.

‘As long as they did not save messages on phones, such messages would not be detected. Jason Seale was recorded saying how this method of contact was ‘untraceable’.

‘They used many code names: “paper” for money, “jacket” for cannabis and “trainers or roadrunners” for amphetamines. They were in the process of setting up a production line when police intervened.’

On one raid on a flat in Castleton, 
Rochdale in December 2011, police found 188,734 ecstasy tablets, 176kg 
of cannabis resin and 67kg of amphetamine worth at least £2.5million.

Police
 rounded up the gang over the course of the following three months. Seale 
was held in Holland. His right hand man Byron Milne, 29, was sentenced 
to a total of 14 and a half years.

Transport manager Ceri Wilmot, 41, was jailed for ten years. Andrew O’Reilly, 27, was sentenced to eight years. Courier Michael Connolly, 28, was jailed for five years.

'The incriminating pictures we found just showed the audacity of these criminals'

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson

Braund, 31, whose mobile phone contained incriminating evidence of his drug crimes, and Steven Petrie, 47, whose home address was used to store the drugs, was jailed for 11 years.

Courier Saied Omidi, 53, was jailed for two and a half years. Dutchmen Theodorus Van Gelder, 54, and Edwin Gorlee, 47, were jailed for eight and ten years respectively. All admitted conspiracy.

After the case Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson said: ‘This group were at the top of the drugs supply network in the North West of England and we are delighted with the sentences handed down.

‘The incriminating pictures we found just showed the audacity of these criminals.’
