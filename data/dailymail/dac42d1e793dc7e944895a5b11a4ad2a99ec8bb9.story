The bride-to-be involved in a mid-air fight with one of her bridesmaids at the start of her hen party has been exposed as a benefits cheat.

Kelly Lloyd, 30, was seen fighting with Katrina Hanafin, 33, after she and her friends took off on a flight from Manchester to Spain last week.

It emerged today that Miss Lloyd was convicted of cheating the benefits system in 2012, when she wrongly claimed £28,000 in income support in a three-year scam.

Kelly Lloyd wrongly claimed £28,000 in income support after failing to tell authorities her partner, Lee Brennan, had moved in with her

Mother-of-three Miss Lloyd, of Carnforth, Lancashire, did not tell authorities that her fiance Lee Brennan had moved in with her, allowing her to falsely pocket thousands, it emerged today.

She pleaded guilty to failing to alert the Lancaster City Council to a change in  circumstances and avoided prison on a 12-month community order.

Reports from the time say investigators carried out surveillance on Miss Lloyd's then-home in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire and regularly spotted Mr Brennan's van outside.

Miss Lloyd, 30, and her friends are due to return from her hen party in Lloret de Mar, near Barcelona today.

Footage shows the mid-air brawl begun as two members of the group start fighting. Seconds later, the bride-to-be, dressed in white and with a veil in her hair, ran up and joined in.

Miss Hanafin, 33, flew home from Spain the day after the row and has since reported the incident to police.

Miss Hanafin, from Carnforth, Lancashire, said: 'It is absolutely appalling what has happened to me.

'I have been nothing but nice to Kelly and her two sisters and her friends and this is how she repays me. The wedding is in May but I certainly will not be going. No way.

'I'm not sure what even led to a fight on the plane. There were crossed words, along the lines of [Kelly] saying nobody wants to sit with me and the next thing I knew I was being punched from behind on the side of my head.

'I was sat in the middle of two girls in a row of three so I couldn't do anything.

'All I could do was curl up in a ball while I was rained blows over my face, arms, shoulders and legs and my hair pulled, as I tried to cover myself.

'After that I asked the cabin crew to move me. I didn't want to be a part of the hen party after that.

'It cost me a lot of money to go there and a fortune to get back. I'm now covered in bruises and can't move my arm. I don't know what they've done to me. I went to A&E and I've got to have physio. I can't believe what has happened.'

Miss Hanafin landed back at Manchester Airport on Friday afternoon. She denied earlier reports that she had been arrested once the plane had landed at Barcelona, saying she had spent the night at the airport before flying back to Manchester.

Miss Lloyd has insisted she only acted in self defence during the brawl and had not been drinking before the flight.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police confirmed they are aware of the incident and will be speaking to the rest of the bridal party before deciding whether to take further action.

Mr Brennan, who has his own business paving drives, is believed to be in Magaluf, Majorca with his friends.
