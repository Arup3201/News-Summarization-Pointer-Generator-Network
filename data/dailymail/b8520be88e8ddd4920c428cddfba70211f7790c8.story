Sen. Rand Paul announced today his plans to introduce a resolution in December that would formally declare war on ISIS and give the president limited authority to use American ground troops in the battle against the extremist group.

'I believe the President must come to Congress to begin a war and that Congress has a duty to act,' Paul said in a statement this morning. 'Right now, this war is illegal until Congress acts pursuant to the Constitution and authorizes it.' 

If accepted by Congress Paul's resolution would mark the first time since 1942 that the U.S issued an official declaration of war.  

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul,  pictured here speaking to the Chase Federalist Society at Northern Kentucky University on Friday in Highland Heights, will introduce a resolution in the Senate calling for a formal declaration of war on ISIS

Presence: American troops are already present in Baghdad as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. Last week General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, addressed some who are in the Iraqi capital

The one-year resolution would specifically authorize the president 'to use the Armed Forces of the United States to protect the people and facilities of the United States in Iraq and Syria against the threats posed' by ISIS, and only ISIS, alternatively known as ISIL or the Islamic State.

U.S. ground forces would only be allowed to engage in combat under strict conditions 'as necessary for the protection or rescue of members of the United States Armed Forces or United States citizens from imminent danger posed by' ISIS, 'for limited operations against high value targets' or 'as necessary for advisory and intelligence gathering operations'.

The White House has claimed it already has the jurisdiction it needs to continue striking ISIS beyond the already expired 60-day window outlined in the War Powers Resolution of 1973 through a decade-old Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) agreement passed by Congress after 9/11.

But a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have said that the outdated agreement doesn't apply to the current fight overseas and Congress would need to pass a new AUMF for the White House to continue bombing Iraq and Syria. 

While the White House has said it work with legislators to come up with a new arrangement, Republican Sens. John McCain and Bob Corker, the likely chairs of the Armed Forces and Foreign Relations committees in the Senate next legislative session, told Roll Call on Friday that the executive branch has yet to follow through on its pledge.

Paul has taken the debate a step further, telling the New York Times that a new AUMF isn't enough.

'War cannot be initiated without Congress,' he said, and it cannot be conducted without a formal declaration.

In action: An airstrike in Kobane, which has become one of the key battles with ISIS. Among the US military assets already deployed are drones, fighter-bombers including F-16s and B1B heavy bombers

Stronghold: An ISIS fighter in Raqua, which has become the de facto capital of the Islamic state. The town has been in the fanatics' grip all year after they defeated the Syrian government's forces 

Show of force: ISIS have made propaganda images one of their most powerful weapons, with this parade through Raqqua inteded to show 

The Kentucky senator said his Republican colleagues who are concerned about the president overstepping his powers through the use of an executive order to end the threat of deportation for millions of illegal immigrants and in other areas ought to be on board with his calls for proper war documents.

'Conservatives are mad at him about immigration. And they're mad about him using executive authority on Obamacare,' Paul told the Times. 'But this is another example where he doesn't have much respect for Congress, and some conservatives don't quite get that.'

Paul's resolution would terminate a 2002 AUMF authorizing military force in Iraq and introduce a one-year sunset into another one, issued in 2001, that the Obama administration has been chaining the legal authority for its current campaign in the Middle East on to.

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told the Times that he too plans to rally his colleagues to adopt a one-year resolution authorizing the fight against ISIS, but his bill would does not call for the formal declaration of war. It also doesn't nullify the 2001 AUMF like Paul's, the news publication said.

'Rand and I, we see very closely on this issue,' the Virginia Senator told the Times.

'We both feel like you can't have a war without congressional authorization of some kind. Congress cannot just let this power rest down at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue.'

In an interview with Politico, Kaine said he believes some forces that can act as 'spotters' will be needed on the ground in Iraq to confirm the coordinates of suggested airstrike targets.

'I've become convinced that this notion of having folks to help with spotting and targeting is probably appropriate,' Kaine said at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada.

Fellow Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff concurred.

'Congress may be willing to endure small numbers of spotters or Special Forces,' he told Politico. 'I'm open to that.'

In September Paul told the Daily Beast, 'I don't think there need to be any American soldiers over there on the ground.

'The people on the ground fighting these battles, going hand-to-hand with ISIS, need to be their fellow Arabs and those who, I think and hopefully do, represent civilized Islam.' 

Vote? : New Senators and members of the House together for a group shot on the steps of the Capital. They would be asked to vote on war if Rand Paul's plan  doesn't come to fruition until the new Congress convenes

However he said, 'I don't mind helping them through technical support, through sophisticated intelligence, drones, Air Force, etc.'  

Paul's resolution leaves the option open for boots on the ground in restricted circumstances while not explicitly endorsing it.

'He doesn't believe we should send a bunch of troops in to start a ground war,' Doug Stafford, a senior aide to Paul told the Daily Beast on Monday. 'But he has always said we have an obligation to defend people in the region. The declaration is tailored to allow for this.

Stafford later told the Daily Beast, 'It has always been a given that American troops could be required to secure the people and property of our embassy and consulate. 

'Senator Paul believes that boots on the ground beyond those limited number as outlined in the declaration should come from allies in the region, as he has previously stated.'

 

President Barack Obama has promised that no U.S. forces would be put into combat during the mission in Iraq.

However the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, indicated during a congressional hearing this fall that a situation could arise in which he would advise the president to rethink his position.

One-year resolution would authorize the president to engage ISIS militarily, including the limited use of U.S. ground forces 

@highlight

They would fight under strict limits, including 'limited operations against high value targets' and 'intelligence gathering'

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine plans to introduce a similar one-year resolution but it would not formally declare war

Last formal declarations of war were as part of Second World War with presidents since then using authorizations for military force
