A little known but fatal illness called Valley Fever is spreading at an unprecedented speed across the Southwest due to the dry weather.

The condition also known as coccidioidomycosis is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is disrupted and inhaled initially causes flu like symptoms but can become deadly if untreated.

Government estimates say more than 160,000 people living in arid areas of the U.S. including large swathes of California and Arizona get the illness every year.

Drought: Valley Fever is increased in dry weather conditions which are likely to be seen across the southwest in coming months

Of that number 160 will die as a result and is the exponential rise in the number of cases year-on-year that is causing concern.

'I think suddenly people realized this was an ongoing problem,' Dr. John Galgiani, the director of the Valley Fever Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix told CBS.

'But a small percentage of people get really serious problems, when the fungus either doesn't go away in your lungs, or it moves through the blood stream to other parts of the body, like the brain or bones or the skin.'

His concerns were reiterated by Dr Royce Johnson, professor of medicine at UCLA and chief of infectious diseases at Kern Medical Center.

'Valley fever is a very common problem here, and it devastates people's lives,' he told the broadcaster.

Increasing: The number of cases climbed exponentially up to 2011 - a record year for Valley Fever

Southwest: The illness effects arid areas of the U.S. which tend to be in the Southwest

'But many patients don't know about it, and some physicians are only vaguely aware of it because half of our physicians come from out of state.'

From 1998 to 2011, the number of Valley Fever cases rose by more than 850 per cent according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

In California alone cases rose from 700 in 1998 to more than 5,000 cases in 2011.

Across the country there were 22,000 cases in 2011 but doctors estimate a further 150,000 were unreported.

Valley Fever - also known as 
coccidioidomycosis - is caused when a naturally occurring soil fungus is 
disrupted and inhaled

In affected areas it is more likely when weather conditions are hot and dry and dust which carries the fungus is more common

It initially causes flu like symptoms but can become 
deadly if untreated. It can damage the lungs, spread to the brain and bones and even cause blindness

people living in arid areas of the U.S. including large swathes of 
California and Arizona get the illness every year

Of that number 160 people die as a result while 150,000 don't report it - in many cases not realizing they have it

Those most at risk include people who work outside in areas where the fungus naturally occurs

Both California and Arizona saw a slight drop in incidence last year but experts say they were exceptions to the ever growing trend. 

The illness is caused when tiny spores carried by soil dust are dislodged by construction, wind or human activity. 

In cases where the illness becomes 
serious it can spread from the lungs to the brain and even eyes, causing
blindness, skin abscesses and organ failure.

Warmer conditions create more dust and therefore more chance of illness - making this year's drought a real cause for concern.

'Research has shown that when soil is
dry and it is windy, more spores are likely to become airborne in 
endemic areas,' said Dr. Gil Chavez, Deputy Director of the Center for 
Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Health told 
CBS.

62 inmates of California's Pleasant 
Valley State Prison and Avenal State Prison were killed earlier this 
month by the condition and the prisons' 3,300 inmates had to be moved 
because infection rates were so high. Doctors said the high incidence 
was a 'public health emergency'.

In the same week 28 workers at a solar power plant construction site in San Luis Obispo County were taken ill.

Last year, New York Mets first baseman Ike Davis famously caught the illness mid-season and was taken out of action.

Valley Fever is caused by fungal organisms called coccidioides and when in the lungs can cause chest pain and coughing.

The disease is often misdiagnosed and sufferers often have no noticeable symptoms at all.

A drought following a strong rainy season is the worst condition for spreading the disease. Rain causes spores to grow and then hot windy weather spread them.

New residents in areas where the disease is prevalent are more susceptible because their bodies aren't used to the fungus while those who work outdoors in desert conditions are also more likely to catch it.

Todd Scully - a winemaker in Paso Robles, California - is one such sufferer and he is in 'constant pain' according to CBS.

Medication to treat the illness means he can't taste his own wine.

'It'll change your life, it's as simple as that,' he told the broadcaster.  'Sometimes it's excruciating, sometimes -- it's always a dull roar.'

'I know it's compromising my life, and I know it'll probably end my life sooner than later.'

Doctors advise those working outside in summer months wear masks to try and avoid catching valley fever.

Residents of arid areas are also advised to stay inside during dust storms and keep windows shut.
