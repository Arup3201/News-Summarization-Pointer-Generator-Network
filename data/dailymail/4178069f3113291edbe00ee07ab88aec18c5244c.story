Secret: Mary Berry lives on a diet of toast and soup - and contestants' cakes - to stay slim, she revealed

She stays slim despite eating her way through several contestants’ cakes, pies and biscuits on the Great British Bake Off.

Now Mary Berry has revealed the secret of her enviable figure – she eats nothing but a single piece of toast for breakfast.

The TV judge said she also limits herself to a bowl of soup at lunch, leaving her enough room for all the sweet treats she samples on the BBC baking programme.

‘I have been large in my time,’ she said. ‘I know that if I were really quite big, people would look at me and say, “That’s  what happens when you eat a  lot of cake”.

‘I’m very disciplined. I make myself eat one piece of toast for breakfast. When I’m doing Bake Off, I eat soup for lunch.

‘I know what puts on weight for me, its just over-indulgence.

‘It’s a case of grasping the  mettle. I know it’s difficult. It’s about everything in moderation. And a small bit of cake.’

The veteran baker made her comments yesterday during an appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales. She admitted that despite being an accomplished cook, she often indulges in quick-fix food.

‘There are times when I don’t want to cook,’ she said.

‘When I come home from Bake Off, my husband opens the door and we have scrambled eggs.’

Miss Berry also confessed that she sometimes uses ready-made pastry when cooking at home as she would ‘rather play tennis’ than spend time slaving over it.

The 79-year-old revealed that she feels ‘terribly guilty’ for working when her children were young.

When she was a young cookery star, she said she ‘didn’t have the confidence’ to take time off but felt sad she was not there for the school run.

The 79-year-old, who presents the show with Paul Hollywood, said she has been larger before

Asked how she kept going despite having a family, she added: ‘I had a passion for what I do. I have a husband who supports me. I had a mother’s help.

‘There wasn’t maternity leave like there is now … I didn’t have the confidence to think that I could have a year off and they would have me back again.

‘I couldn’t have done it without Paul being there to do the  school run.’
