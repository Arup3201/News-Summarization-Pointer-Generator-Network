Celebrities are infamous for their demanding ways and bad behaviour, and nowhere is this more apparent than when they splash out on a stay at a hotel.

Lindsay Lohan is infamous for her shenanigans at Shutters on the Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, California but her antics were overshadowed by Charlie Sheen's escapades at The Plaza Hotel in New York, which reportedly cost him $7,000 (£4,000) in damages,

From Lilo's exorbitant unpaid hotel bills to Florence setting a hotel room on fire, these celebs prove that fame can sometimes go their heads.

Amanda Bynes

The troubled Amanda Bynes has had a rough time of it but things are looking up for the child star. Recently released from a Malibu rehab centre, Bynes is working hard to get her life back on track. 

But things were far from rosy last year when the starlet was kicked out of the £422-a-night Ritz-Carlton Central Park. Her crime? The actress had allegedly insulted hotel staff, trashed her room, and she reportedly smoked marijuana then tried to spray chemicals to get rid of the smell.

The actor has been in and out of the press for bad behaviour, and in 2010 the former Two and a Half Men star caused over $7,000 (£4,200) in damages to his suite at The Plaza Hotel, New York.

It was claimed the 48-year-old – who entered rehab in January 2011 – stripped to his underwear and wrecked his luxury suite. All this while his girlfriend was screaming in a locked closet. According to the actor's representative, the star was having a bad reaction to medication, which caused his untoward behaviour.

The flame-haired siren of Florence and the Machine has come clean about her scandalous behaviour at New York's Bowery Hotel in 2012. The singer confessed to Q Magazine that, after a night of boozing it up with Kanye West and Lykke Li, she woke up to find that 'half the room was singed.'

I think I must have had about 17 Dirty Martinis,' she said. 'I lost my phone and ripped my dress very badly. I accidentally set fire to The Bowery Hotel because I'd left a cinnamon tea light burning.

'I came back to the hotel, passed out in my ripped dress — no phone, chipped tooth — came round and there was black stuff all over the wall, my book had melted on the bedside table and there was a bucket of water on the floor.' 

Courtney Love caused over £3,000 worth of damages in eight hours at The Inn on Irving Place in New York

Kurt Cobain's widow has a hard-partying reputation and she certainly lived up to it during her stay at New York's The Inn on Irving Place.

According to sources, the former frontwoman of Hole left used feminine hygiene products and dirty needles behind, as well flooding the floor, which ruined the accommodations. 

'She caused so much damage in eight hours and wreaked so much havoc. It was actually kind of funny . . . minus the $5,000 in repairs,' one insider told The New York Post.

Chateau Marmont general manager Philip Pavel sent Lindsay Lohan a letter asking her to settle her £28,000 bill

What's a bad behaviour list without the original Mean Girl in it? Lindsay's notorious antics aren't just confined to her exorbitant unpaid bill at Chateau Marmont. 

The star, who racked up $46,590.62 (£28,000) at the Sunset Boulevard hotel is reportedly blacklisted from nine hotels. Staff at Shutters on the Beach allegedly found a bloody syringe on a room service tray.

Lindsay's other hotel crimes include  causing $50,000 (£30,000) worth of damage to her room at the W New York Union Square. Reports say the hotel had to replace all of the carpet in the room, which was covered in cigarette burns.
