A councillor who called Margaret Thatcher an ‘old b****’ has been given an harassment order for bullying a member of the public who complained.

Ian Dent, who sits on Carnforth town council in Lancashire, made more than 30 abusive and silent phone calls to Lawrence Branyan and threatened to ‘pay him a personal visit’.

At one stage he even blew a whistle down the phone for two minutes.

Out of order: Ian Dent has been handed a 12-month harassment order for insulting Margaret Thatcher as he repeatedly pestered a member of the public, once blowing a whistle down the phone for two minutes

Mr Branyan, 55, complained after Dent made the derogatory comments about the late prime minister in a council agenda.

Police traced the phone calls back to Dent and issued him with a 12-month harassment order on May 18 last year.

Part of his email sent to Mr Branyan on April 22 last year read: 'Do your worst pathetic little man. She was a b****.

'Thank you for giving me the perfect opportunity to drag what remains of Thatcher’s reputation through the mire.

'I do regret calling Thatcher a b**** in one sense. It is, after all, a considerable defamation of the faithful female members of the dog world, who are reputed to be man’s best friend.

'Sir, you are a silly puppet. A simplistic soul who is furthering the petty campaigns of others.

He later emailed harassed member of the public Lawrence Branyan saying he enjoyed dragging 'what remains of Thatcher's reputation through the mire' and apologised for defaming female dogs by association

'It is of note that when, this evening, you were offered the opportunity to discuss matters you were a spineless and a coward.

'Clearly you are intellectually bankrupt. This illustrates what a pathetic prig you really are.

'I don’t care if you are a member of Rotary Boy Scouts for grown-ups.

'What is that but an elitist organisation where the smug and self-righteous individuals in our community sick to solve their consciences by being supposedly benevolent whilst actually making merely talking gestures from their filthy and often dubiously acquired lucre.'

Lancaster city council’s standards committee found he had breached the town council’s code of conduct, and now the town council has voted to censure him.
