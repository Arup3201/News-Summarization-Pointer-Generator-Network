Barry Rogerson has been jailed for 12 months and banned from football grounds for six years after he admitted punching a police horse in the face

A football fan has been jailed for a year for punching a police horse in the face after a derby match.

Newcastle United fan Barry Rogerson, 45, has also been banned from football grounds for six years after he attacked the horse outside St James' Park after the game between his team and Sunderland on April 14.

Rogerson, of Bedlington, Northumberland, pleaded guilty last month to a charge of violent disorder.

He was jailed for 12 months and handed a six year football banning order when he appeared for sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court today.

Sentencing Rogerson, His Honour
Judge Paul Sloan QC said: 'You attended the football match and by the 
time the match ended you were worse for wear from drinking while taking 
your medication.

'You were clapping your hands at the police horse, remaining there despite repeated requests to move.

'When the crowd surged forward on two separate occasions you were clapping your hands in pleasure or excitement at the events.

'You
started clapping into the horses face. The police horse then started 
moving towards you, you were told to move back by the officer.

'You had plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head.

'There
was a risk of serious injury from what you did. That officer could have
been thrown from the horse causing serious injury.

'On
this particular occasion you drank far more than you should have. You 
are in a stable relationship and have a young son aged 11. Your position
is aggravated by your consumption of alcohol.'

Rogerson pleaded guilty last month to a charge of violent disorder

Robert Adams, mitigating for Rogerson, told the court: 'Mr Rogerson was a man of good character.

'He
is 45-years-of-age and he, perhaps more than any other, has had the 
humiliation of almost constant press coverage about his involvement.

'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed of what happened. It has been difficult for him but also for his family and friends.

'He
has a very good work record of 22 years, it is only illness that stops 
him from working. He has never bothered the police before in any way and
he has never appeared in any court.

Rogerson was one of seven men dealt with at Newcastle Crown Court today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder

'He lives on disability allowance and his wife is in employment.

'He is therefore a man of difficulties. He is not somebody who has ever supported or encouraged this type of behaviour.

'There is no question he had a particularly large amount to drink on this day.

'He had gone to watch the match, he was with a group of friends. Most of them were completely unaware what took place until afterwards.

'He was not involved in any trouble before the start of the match. He appears afterwards to have taken up a position at an early stage.

'When there was a line of Newcastle supporters facing the police he was joining in with the jeering that was taking part at that stage. Sadly for him he maintained his position during the two sieges.

'He did not punch any human, officer or Sunderland supporter in any way. No missiles or other weapon was thrown by the defendant.

'He has no previous convictions of any sort. It is not the case that he was involved in other acts of violence around the city centre.

'His wife has told him he is not going to another football match ever.'

He added: 'Mr Rogerson has acted completely out of character while under the influence of drink.'

Rogerson was one of seven men being dealt with by Newcastle Crown Court today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder. All were jailed.

After the hearing Chief Superintendent Gary Calvert, Newcastle Area Commander, said: 'The images of Rogerson's behaviour were seen right across the country and further afield through the media and internet coverage of the disorder.

His Honour Judge Paul Sloan QC told Rogerson (pictured) he had 'plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head'

'His behaviour is clearly unacceptable and he was widely condemned by law abiding and right thinking members of the public for his actions.

'I'm keen to stress that this shouldn't be the lasting impression people have of the city of Newcastle and its football supporters.

'The derby is attended by more than 50,000 fans, including families and children, and on that day Rogerson was in the minority of people involved in disorder in Newcastle city centre after the match.

'This is absolutely not reflective of the behaviour of true football supporters and those who live in, work in and visit Newcastle.

'I welcome the sentences passed today to offenders for their part in the disorder. In particular, with the next derby just days away, I'm keen to stress that this demonstrates tough action will be taken against anyone involved in such behaviour.

'As well as a potential prison sentence, banning orders mean they will be kept away from future football matches, making them a safer environment for the real supporters who want nothing more than to enjoy the game.

'It must be noted there have been 90 people charged in connection with the disorder following the match and the majority of these are still progressing through the court system.'

The other defendants sentenced in court today after pleading guilty to violent disorder were: Alan Graham, 21, of Benwell - 18 months imprisonment; Michael Barker, 24, of Prudhoe - 18 months; Thomas Simpson, 22, of Prudhoe - 16 months; John Guthrie, 22, of New Hartley, Blyth - 16 months; Sam Miller, 19, of Harton, South Shields - 16 months plus two months for breaching a suspended prison sentence; and Robert Taylor, 18, of Elswick, Newcastle - 20 months in a young offender institution.

All those sentenced were given six-year football banning orders.
