On Friday night Wembley hosted England's 3-0 win against Peru in a World Cup warm-up game before staging the biggest fight in British boxing history 24 hours later.

Thanks to incredible time-lapse footage the stadium's transformation from a world class football pitch to a boxing arena which commanded the attention of millions worldwide has been captured and can be watched in a two-minute video.

From the moment the final whistle was blown in England’s game against Peru, a team of 400 people worked through the night in order to transform the stadium in time for the first boxing event held at the new Wembley.

A total of 15 articulated trucks, thousands of metres of cabling and hundreds of man hours were combined to convert the stadium from hosting an international football match watched by more than 80,000 fans into the venue for a sell-out crowd to watch Carl Froch knock out George Groves in the eighth round to retain his IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles.

In total, more than 160,000 fans visited the stadium for the two events, making it one of the busiest 24-hour periods in the stadium’s history.

Since the new Wembley opened in 2007, it has hosted a huge variety of international sporting events including England internationals, FA Cup finals, Champions League Finals, the London 2012 Olympic Games, Rugby League World Cup semi-finals, NFL matches and music concerts from bands including Muse, the Foo Fighters, Take That and The Killers.

The stadium will now undergo a further transformation in readiness of hosting three nights of One Direction concerts from 6 – 8 June.
