A hate-filled note attached to the doors of a synagogue has branded Jews as 'child murderers' in the latest of a spate of anti-Semetic attacks in Britain.

Samuel Landau, 26, the rabbi at Kingston, Surbiton and District Synagogue in Surrey, arrived this week to find the sick message attached to the entrance.

The father-of-one says he now feels threatened and has condemned those who 'tar everybody with the same brush'.

'Child Murderers': The hate-filled message was attached to the doors of Kingston, Surbiton and District Synagogue in Surrey

Fear: Rabbi Samuel Landau, 26, who called the police when he found the note at the doors of the synagogue (pictured) said he no longer feels safe

The number of anti-Semitic attacks on Jewish people in Britain soared in July, believed to be because of the ongoing conflict in Gaza. One incident saw vandals target gravestones at a cemetery in Rochdale, Manchester

Statistics show that 304 anti-Semitic 
incidents were reported in the UK between January and June - a 36 per 
cent rise compared to the same period a year ago.

Mr Landau, a trainee criminal psychologist, called the police when he saw the note and  believes he is at risk of similar attacks.

'When the distinction between Palestine and Israel motivates you to behave in such a way - with no thought to debate or discussion - I think that is worrying,' he said.

'I am disappointed the society we live in is not able to process and think things through and tars everybody with the same brush. I feel less safe.'

Rabbi Landau,  who presides over Sabbaths through the week, said offensive material had previously been put up outside the synagogue some years before when Israel had been involved inprevious conflicts.

He added: 'It is not something out of the blue. I look like a Jew when I walk down the road in Kingston and several people have shouted out of their car at me, so this does not seem out of place.'

The Community Security Trust have recorded 130 attacks on British Jews  since the start of the Middle East conflict on July 8, which has so far killed more than 1,400 Palestinians and about 60 Israelis.

Mark Gardner, a spokesman for CST, said: ‘There is no excuse for this wave of racist intimidation and violence and we call upon all good people to unequivocally condemn it.’

Tens of thousands of Britons have taken part in protests in London and other cities against the Israeli action.

Pro-Palestinian activist groups stress that they oppose Israeli government policy and are not hostile to the Jewish people.

Some of the signs at protests have however been distinctly anti-Jewish.

Although the overall total of anti-Semitic incidents this year has increased, there were fewer violent assaults recorded - down 32 percent to 22, and the vast number of incidents related to verbal abuse, graffiti and abuse via social media.

The number of recorded incidents had been falling in recent years from a high in 2009, which was also sparked by conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza when politicians said that British Jews faced a ‘real and growing danger".

This month's surge in incidents has also provoked concern.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual head of the world's 80 million Anglicans, voiced unease at the impact of the conflict in Gaza.

‘While it is acceptable to question and even disagree with particular policies of the Israeli government, the spike in violence and abuse against Jewish communities here in the UK is simply unacceptable,’ he said in a statement.

‘We must not allow such hostility to disrupt the good relations we cherish among people of all faiths.’

MP John Mann, chairman of a parliamentary group against anti-Semitism, said the latest report was troubling.

‘From the feedback we are receiving, it is likely that the volume of anti-Semitic incidents will increase significantly before the year's end,’ he said.

Jewish people in Britain are enduring a backlash of attacks, bomb threats and anti-Semitic insults fuelled by the bloodshed in Gaza.

A total of 130 hate crimes were recorded by police and community groups in July, more than double the usual number.

In several disturbing cases attackers have invoked the Holocaust and even shouted: ‘Heil Hitler’ at victims.

A rabbi was attacked by four Muslim teenagers outside a Jewish boarding school in Gateshead in one of the most serious incidents.

In Belfast, bricks were thrown at the city’s only synagogue, smashing windows on two consecutive nights.

Groups of Asian men chanted 'Heil Hitler’ as they drove through a Jewish area of Manchester, throwing missiles at passers-by.

In north London, one pro-Israel organisation received a telephone bomb threat and a Jewish boy riding a bicycle had a stone thrown at his head by a woman in a niqab. 

Peaceful protests against the violence have also been marred by vile placards including one declaring: ‘Hitler you were right!’

At a Central London march, protesters confronted a Jewish woman with her two young children and told them: ‘Burn in hell.’

There has been also been an explosion of anti-Semitic abuse on social networks, including Facebook and Twitter.

One man called for a Jewish neighbourhood in London to be bombed so ‘Jews feel the pain’ of the Palestinians.

In a separate incident, a BBC journalist was reprimanded after seeming to suggest western politicians failed to intervene in the Middle East because they had been ‘bought’ by the Jews.

The surge in attacks and threats follows a similar trend in 2009, when up to 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the Gaza war.
