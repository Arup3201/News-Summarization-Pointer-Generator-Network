Steven Gerrard's display against Uruguay was so bad, according to Spanish newspaper AS, that they refused to even give him a rating for his performance.

There wasn't an England player out there who particularly shone on a fairly harrowing night for Three Lions, but it was Gerrard's unfortunate role in both of Luis Suarez's goals that probably led to him receiving such harsh marks.

The captain was beaten to the ball all too easily in midfield before Uruguay swarmed forward for the first, and got underneath a header from a long ball, from which Suarez pounced upon for the winner.

Deflated: England captain Steven Gerrard looking defeated after their 2-1 loss at the hands of Uruguay

Underrated: Steven Gerrard not even given a rating by Spanish paper AS (who mark out of three)

Most of England's team hardly fared any better, with Joe Hart, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka, Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck receiving just one out of three.

Goalscorer Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and fullbacks Glen Johnson and Leighton Baines all managed to must a two.

And, unsurprisingly, the superb Suarez who was only the man given full marks on the night.

Critical: French sports paper L'Equipe were equally scathing of Gerrard's performance, awarded him a 3/10

Over in France, meanwhile, sports paper L'Equipe were equally scathing of Gerrard's performance - awarding him just a 3/10.

Jagielka was also given the same low mark, with only Sturridge, Johnson and Rooney given more than a five.

Uruguay, naturally, fared a lot better, with captain Diego Godin their only man venturing below halfway in the ratings.
