Have you ever wondered where Russians would go if we dropped nuclear bombs on them?

Thanks to eye-opening pictures provided by Moscow construction worker Mikhail Bratza, we in the West can now see the grim 650-feet underground welcome that 2,700 Russian citizens would receive if nuclear war became reality.

The only problem is that the bunker's power and water supplies would fail after just two days, leaving refugees with no choice but to venture into the nuclear wasteland their city would have become.

The life support system includes two-foot thick steel reinforced doors, diesel generators, water pumps, chemical and radiation proof suits, gas masks, post-nuclear transport and wooden bunks to sleep on.

Other features of Moscow's Site 1 include enough non-radioactive water in the tanks for three-liters per person per day, food for three meals a day, automatic fire extinguishers, air-con, 75 toilets and bathroom capacity for 200 people to wash at any one time.

Meanwhile, a gigantic, secret bunker that Albania's communist regime built underground decades ago to survive a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union or the United States has been opened to the public for the first time.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Edi Rama led visitors, including Western ambassadors, on a tour of the never used 106-room, five-story bunker.

'We have opened today a thesaurus of the collective memory that presents thousands of pieces of the sad events and life' under communism,' Rama said, speaking at the bunker's 200-seat hall, which was to serve as the meeting place for parliament.

The bunker was built by the late communist dictator Enver Hoxha near Tirana, the capital, in the 1970s to prepare for a possible nuclear attack by 'American imperialism or Soviet social-imperialism.' Hoxha, whose regime built up to 700,000 bunkers of different sizes and tunnels all around the country, died in 1985. The communist regime was toppled in 1990.

Rama said the bunker was opened ahead of Albania's World War II liberation day this month. The government plans to use it as a tourist attraction and an exhibition space for artists.

On display before the bunker, which has been preserved by the military, stood a Soviet-produced Zim-12 luxury car, a gift to Hoxha from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.

The bunker, 100-meters (330 feet) underground, houses a museum with pictures and items from World War II and the communist regime. The heavy cement and metal doors are so low that visitors have to bow down to pass through them.

In the small, cold and smelly rooms one can see military equipment used by the communist regime, mainly received from the Soviet Union and China.

Work on the bunker was completed in 1978, when Tirana broke ties with China. Albania had done that with the Soviets in 1962.
