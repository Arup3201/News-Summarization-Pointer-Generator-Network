Disgraced politician Bo Xilai has told of an illicit affair between his wife and former right-hand man as China’s biggest political trial in 30 years came to a close.

In his testimony yesterday Xilai denounced his wife Gu Kailai and his former police chief Wang Lijun – both key witnesses against him – as a last-ditch effort to redeem his reputation.

The 64-year-old former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary denied charges of embezzlement and bribery in which he is said to have netted £2.7 million and abuses of power by interfering with a murder investigation.

Xilai said in court: ‘He [Lijun] was secretly in love with Gu Kailai, his emotions were tangled and he could not extricate himself.’

During the five-day trial in Jinan, Shandong province Xilai has vigorously defended himself against the criminal charges, recanting earlier confessions, rarely expressing contrition and blaming his wife and others.

According to a transcript of the court proceedings, the prosecutor said: ‘The defendant's crimes are extremely grave, and he also refuses to admit guilt.

‘As such, the circumstances do not call for a lenient punishment but a severe one, in accordance with the law.

‘We
remind the defendant that, Bo Xilai: the facts of the crimes are 
objective, they cannot by changed according to your subjective wishes.’

The corruption charges carry a maximum penalty of death but many believe his sentence will be in the range of 20 years’ imprisonment.

The trial has exposed the complex web of allegiances and dysfunction within Xilai’s family.

Blamed others: Xilai denied charges of bribery and embezzlement in which he is said to have netted £2.7 million and for interfering in the murder investigation of British businessman Neil Heywood

Xilai said: ‘I know I am not a 
perfect person and I had a bad temper and acted subjectively and I made 
serious faults and mistakes. 

‘I
deeply feel that I failed to govern my family and it had a negative 
effect on the state. I sincerely accept the investigation from the party
and the judicial departments, but the charge of corruption is not 
true.'

Murdered: Kailai was convicted of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood (pictured) whose body was found in a hotel in 2011

Bo is accused of providing political favours to a businessman, Xu Ming, in return for having him at his family's beck and call.

According to Xilai's wife, Ming gave 
the family expensive gifts that included a villa in France and 
international airfare to three continents. Bo also is accused of 
funnelling £510,000 in government funds from a secret project.

The court heard allegations over the weekend that Xilai abused his power as the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing to block an investigation into the British businessman Neil Heywood's murder, as well as to hide his aide's embarrassing flight to a U.S. consulate - an event that help set the scandal into motion.

Kailai was convicted of murdering Mr Heywood whose body was found in a hotel in 2011.

Xilai repeated his doubts about the evidence presented by prosecutors yesterday while introducing a bizarre twist to the narrative. He said that Lijun tried to defect to the consulate early last year, not because of the investigation into Mr Heywood’s murder, but because he confessed his feelings for Kailai to the politician.

Xilai's downfall had been widely perceived as the result of his defeat during party infighting ahead of last fall's once-a-decade leadership transition.

Xilai testified: ‘He [Lijun] knew my 
personality, he'd trespassed on my family and violated my basic 
emotions, this is the real reason he decided to defect. Wang Lijun in 
reality is trying to muddy the waters.’ 

He
also said that Lijun and Kailai were as close as ‘glue and lacquer’ and
that they had a ‘very special relationship; I was frustrated by that’.

Lijun had earlier said in court he went 
to the Americans because he feared for his safety after he told Xilai 
that the politician's wife had murdered the Briton.

Xilai was accused of sacking Lijun as police chief and deputy mayor last year without consulting senior authorities. He also allegedly fabricated Lijun’s medical records to indicate that he was insane. 

With a note of resignation, Xilai thanked the court for letting him fully defend himself yesterday. 

He said: ‘I know there is no escape from my fate and sometimes I was weak at heart. Faced by imprisonment, I have mixed feelings and the only thing I have is the rest of my life.’ 

A date for the verdict has not yet been given.
