The parents of school girl Rhianna Barreau, who vanished without a trace almost 23 years ago, have broken their silence about their missing daughter.

The 12-year-old was last seen walking away from her Morphett Vale home in South Australia on the morning of October 7, 1992 during the school holidays.

She was at home alone and intended to walk to the nearby Southgate Shopping Centre at Reynella in Adelaide's south to buy a Christmas card for her American pen pal.

Rhianna Barreau vanished without a trace almost 23 years ago. Her parents have broken their silence about their missing daughter

When her mother returned home in the afternoon, she found a Christmas card on the dining table but Rhianna was nowhere in sight. 

And to this day, the mystery of her disappearance has never been solved.

Her parents, Paula, 65 and Leon, 62 have accepted their daughter was murdered after being abducted from their home but the pair are still searching for answers.

Ms Barreau still recalls the morning when she spoke with her daughter about her plans to walk down to the local newsagency because of a bus strike that day, Sunday Mail reports.

Her mother revealed every parent's worst nightmare following months of pain she had endured and sleepless nights which then turned into years

Wakefield Avenue in Morphett Vale - in Adelaide's south - was where the 12-year-old was last seen

Her mother revealed the months of pain she had endured and sleepless nights, which then turned into years.

'I was hoping she was just at a friend's place and had forgotten what the time was but that's not like her,' she told Sunday Mail.

In a major turn for the investigation, South Australian police have launched a campaign in a bid to solve a number of the state's cold cases, including Rhianna's disappearance.

Police suspect the 12-year-old was murdered and believe someone holds information that could solve her baffling disappearance.

With a million-dollar reward on offer for anyone who can provide information leading to a conviction in Rhianna's case, Ms Barreau said the new initiative may offer some hope of a breakthrough.

'I understand there are also people out there who will do anything for money,' she said.

'But if that leads to solving it, to justice, to being able to find Rhianna, that's fine.'

Rhianna was last seen wearing purple shorts, a green T-shirt with the word 'Hypercolour' printed across the front, white socks and white 'Lynx' sneakers with bright pink laces.

Police are urging people who have any information or think they know something that may help the  investigation to come forward or contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
