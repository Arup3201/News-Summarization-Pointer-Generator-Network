The Ghost River Valley in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta is a Mecca for experienced climbers, providing some of the longest, most  beautifully ethereal and lethal climbing spots in the world.

Temperatures can drop to as low as minus seven degrees centigrade in the glacier-sliced valley and  frozen waterfalls stretch from 100 to 1,000 feet for brave climbers to try and scale.

This series of incredible photographs show experienced mountaineers Larry Shiu, 30, and Jonathan Fox, 30, scaling a monstrous 300 foot frozen waterfall called the 'Rainbow Serpent'.

The slippery nature of the natural ice structure means both men know that one foot wrong could mean the difference between life and death.

Adventure photographer John, from Canberra, Australia, said: 'The conditions at Ghost River Valley are always challenging, ice climbing is exposed, cold and often wet. 

'It can be very hard at times, there is suffering no doubt.' 

The team used basic climbing gear including ice axes, ice screws, head torches and harnesses and managed to complete their expedition safely reaching the summit. John used a Canon 6D camera to take the stomach churning aerial shots of the climbers digging their toes and axes in along the way.

Where's Wally? The waterfalls in the Canadian Alberta region are so colossal that it can be hard to pick out climbers from afar

The Ghost River Valley, part of the Canadian Rockies, consists of 60 square miles of raw wilderness bordering Banff National Park to the east and north. The glacier carved valley contains several sites where steep water runoffs from its peaks produce some of the best waterfall ice climbs in Canada.

The Rainbow Serpent, which is approximately 300 feet tall, is widely considered to be the most challenging frozen waterfall to climb in Ghost Valley. Only the most experienced climbers are advised to attempt it.

These structures  form when snow accumulating above  settles, then slowly melts and refreezes while dripping down the wall

John says, 'The climbs are not there year round, only in the winter. They are formed by what is called a 'melt freeze cycle' where snow accumulating above will settle, then slowly melt and refreeze while dripping down the wall.

'That is how these giant ice climbs are formed. They are not all necessarily flowing waterfalls in summertime and some of these climbs never form and will go years without appearing.'

Surely a cumbersome camera adds to a precious load? 'It  takes motivation, sometimes you just want to climb and leave the camera at home, switch off and just enjoy the day but I love photographing climbing, it is my strongest passion in life after climbing,' says John.

'Combining these two passions inspires me deeply and I love capturing the greatest moments of my life and telling stories of both the unique places and the climbers.'  

Ice climbing can be a risky activity, with dangerous climbs often resulting in fatality.

Last month, Australian Michael Taylor, 29, plummeted more than 300m to his death while climbing a glacier in Canada.

It is believed the mountaineer was using minimal climbing equipment when attempting to scale the Stadium Glacier on Sky Pilot Mountain in Squamish, Vancouver.

Long lengths of rope are used to attach climbers. Some expeditions in this area have led to fatalities.

Ghost River Valley offers  adventurers 100 to 1,000 ft vertical climbs in conditions which can dip below seven degrees centigrade

Worth it: The views in the Canadian Rockies are spectacular
