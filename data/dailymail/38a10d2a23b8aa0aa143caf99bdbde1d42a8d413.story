An alleged member of a paedophile sex ring which targeted choir boys has been arrested in Spain after nearly 30 years on the run.

Colin Brown, 85, was detained in the Costa del Sol resort of Benalmadena on a European Arrest Warrant on Monday.

Spanish police said the Brit had been a fugitive since the late 1980s and had been at one point been feared dead after investigators lost track of him.

He is wanted over a string of sex offences committed in the 70s and 80s on London-based choir boys aged six to 14.

Spain's National Police, in a statement released today which did not name Brown, said: 'The arrested man was one of the members of a paedophile ring which committed several sex offences from 1970 to the end of the 1980s when he left Britain.

'The United Kingdom launched an investigation to identify those responsible for these crimes and tracked down everyone except this man.

'Last year Interpol came across a man whose personal details conceded with the fugitive’s in Spain.

'At that point UK authorities contacted Spain’s National Police to try to find out exactly where he was.'

Confirming the arrest, a Malaga-based police spokesman added: 'Police officers have arrested an 85-year-old British man in Benalmadena on foot of a European Arrest Warrant.

'The warrant relates to seven sex offences and was issued by judicial authorities in the UK.

'The fugitive in question has been at large since the late 1980s. At one point the authorities thought he was dead.

'He is accused of transporting children aged six to 14, members of a London church choir, and choosing several of these youngsters as his victims.'

Brown was arrested on Monday. He is believed to have been detained at the home in Benalmadena where he was living.

He has already been taken to Madrid for an extradition hearing.
