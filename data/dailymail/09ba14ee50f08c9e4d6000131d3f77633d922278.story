Burnley defender Ben Mee has signed a new three-year contract ahead of the club's return to the Premier League.

The 24-year-old, who had 12 months remaining on his existing deal, was a key figure in the team's promotion success last season which saw them keep 19 clean sheets.

'It was an easy decision to make, I've enjoyed my time here, particularly under Sean (Dyche) and it's been a great time since I joined,' he said.

'I've enjoyed my time so far and hopefully we can have many more seasons like the last one and achieve more things.

'It (promotion) was definitely the highlight of my career.

'It's always been a dream of mine to play in the Premier League and hopefully that will be realised this season.

'Last season was a fantastic season for all the lads and we need to go on, push on and top that now which would be really nice.'
