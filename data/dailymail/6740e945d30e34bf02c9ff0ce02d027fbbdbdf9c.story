An Argentine blacksmith has been arrested over allegations he fathered five children with his own daughter.

The man, 53, is accused of repeatedly raping his victim, who is now 31, as he kept her captive inside their Mendoza home since childhood.

Allegedly forcing himself upon her for more than a dozen years, he is said to have claimed she was his reclusive wife when questioned about their relationship.

Accused: The man, 53, was arrested in the Argentinian city of Mendoza. He is accused of repeatedly raping his victim, who is now 31

He is also accused of violently threatening his entire family - including their children, aged between two and 13-years-old - into keeping silent.

His alleged reign of terror came to an end on Friday, however, after he was arrested and taken into custody.

Chilling echoes: The case resembles that of Austrian psycho Josef Fritzl, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth

Clarin reports that police began investigating in February after his son-in-law, the husband of another one of his older daughters, visited a police station to report the allegations.

'The complainant stated that the girl had no boyfriend and it was the father who had abused her and got her pregnant,' said Manuel Ontiveros, from the Mendoza police sex crime unit.

'The man sometimes passed his daughter off as his wife, when he was asked by neighbours or people outside of the family,' Ontiveros added.

A police source said that the man, who has not yet been named, had previously been accused of abusing one of his other daughters - who then left home.

'But as it was not rape, they gave him a suspended sentence and he was not jailed,' the source told Clarin.

Authorities are now investigating whether the girl's mother, who left the family home six years ago, was complicit in her former husband's actions.

Local media say the case has chilling echoes of Austrian psycho Josef Fritzl, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth, who he kept locked inside a basement for 24 years.
