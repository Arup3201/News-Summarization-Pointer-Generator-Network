The buildings of a resort designed to the boost morale of hardworking Nazis are to go on sale at cut price.

The construction, known as Prora, on  Rügen, Germany's largest island, was part of a programme introduced by Hitler, called Kraft durch Freude - meaning 'strength through joy'.

As part of the programme, the Nazi leader organized activities such as skiing and cruises - and intended to build a collection of seaside resorts on Rügen.

Iinitial construction started in 1936, but had to be halted at the onslaught of World War II. Over the next three years, a total of 10,000 rooms were built.

The resort was designed to include eight identical buildings, offering entertainment, catered meals and organised fun based around Nazi propaganda and won an award in 1937 for its Bauhaus design. 

Once war broke out in 1939, the Nazis used the buildings to house workers and provide shelter to refugees, and post-war, they were used to house Soviet and East German military. 

But over time they fell into disrepair and were only saved from demolition thanks to being given a landmark status.

The sombre grey block was seen as an example of Third Reich architecture, along with the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and Berlin's Olympic Stadium.

After the  property was sold to private investors, the first apartments, condos and apartments were built 

The property was sold to private investors and is finally set to realise its purpose as a mega resort, renting and selling holidays homes and condos.

Estate agent, IRIS GERD, who are redeveloping Prora's building Block I, is offering some 'New Prora' units at prices between 200,000 and 250,000 euros - around £160k and £200k.  

Investors believe that despite its history, with the property market on a steep incline in Germany, the holiday homes will sell.

One estate agent, Kathrin Lange, told German press, the buildings are for 'risk-tolerant investors'.
