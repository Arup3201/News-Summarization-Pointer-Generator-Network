'Pack leader': Andrew Debidin, who has escaped an ASBO to reduce the numbers of dogs he owns because of his right to a family life

When Andrew Debidin moved to a new 
home with his pack of nearly 50 German Shepherds, his neighbours were 
understandably concerned.

And they claim that their worst fears 
were confirmed over the next few months when the din from nearby kennels
left them depressed and exhausted, forcing the council to seek an 
Anti-Social Behaviour Order to reduce numbers and control the noise.

But yesterday a sheriff dismissed the 
Asbo bid and allowed Mr Debidin, who she described as the 'pack leader',
to keep all his animals.

Referring to Mr Debidin’s human 
rights, Sheriff Susan Raeburn ruled there was no justification to 
interfere in his 'family life' with his dogs.

She said that while his circumstances 
were 'unusual' - Mr Dedibin sleeps with all but two of his pets in a 
caravan in a remote rural compound - his lifestyle does not amount to 
anti-social behaviour.

The reclusive 58-year-old already has a
history of owning noisy dogs and was jailed and banned from keeping the
animals in England.

The former Vidal Sassoon hairdresser 
moved to the plot near Rothiemay, Moray, early one morning in 2006 after
fleeing from Ardersier, near Inverness, when Highland Council won an 
Asbo against him.

Last night neighbours in Moray were horrified by the court’s decision.

One tearfully said: ‘I feel let down 
by the criminal justice system, we put our faith in it, that it would 
work something equitably but that hasn’t happened.

‘If he could find a way of living the 
way he wants to live without disturbing the rest of us there would not 
be any problem from the community.’

The leader of Moray Council, which tried to reduce the number of dogs to four, said he was disappointed by the decision.

Allan Wright said it was wrong 'for 
the sheriff to to talk about a lifestyle that centres on a man being the
leader of a pack of 46 large dogs'.

It is thought the four-year legal battle could cost the taxpayer around £50,000.

Mr Dedibin’s current home, the Woodhead compound, contains several caravans, and a block of 17 individual kennels.

There are 46 German Shepherds on the site, which is surrounded by a six-foot high perimeter fence.

Retired husband and wife David and Morag Duncan live at Core of Mayen, which is less than half-a-mile away from Mr Debidin.

They were horrified when he moved in with what they thought was 'a truck load of noisy turkeys'.

The Woodhead compound where Mr Debidin lives with his pack of 50 German Shepherds: Neighbours claim the noise made by the dogs has disturbed their sleep

The Duncans kept noise diaries, describing how the German Shepherds’ barking disturbed their sleep.

Mrs Duncan, 66, a retired teacher, 
later told Elgin Sheriff Court that the noise of the dogs was 
disturbing, distressing, disruptive, exhausting and depressing.

Moray Council carried out an investigation into the noise after receiving a formal complaint.

Mr Dedibin was later warned that if he
allowed his dogs to bark at excessive levels, the council would apply 
for an Asbo - which it did in August 2008.

Environmental health officers and 
acoustic experts were instructed to prepare noise level reports and 
work-out how many dogs could be kept there without causing alarm or 
distress.

However, the sheriff said she was 
bewildered as to why Moray Council chose to rely on a report that 
focused on a property in Aberdeenshire that was not relevant to the 
Asbo.

She branded the council experts’ 
starting point for noise pollution as ‘inept’ as they chose a model 
which was for rating industrial noise in mixed industrial and 
residential areas.

Sheriff Raeburn said there were other 
'perplexing and baffling' aspects to their report which called into 
question its evidential value.

She also said their evidence was 'remarkable in its disingenuousness'.

In court, Mr Debidin denied there was a barking problem and said the noise diaries were 'lies and exaggerations'.

One of Mr Debidin's dogs peers through the bottom of the six foot fence surrounding the compound: A Sheriff ruled that there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs

In her report issued yesterday, Sheriff Raeburn said there were no welfare issues surrounding the dogs.

She added that Mr Debidin had not 
acted in a manner or pursued a course of conduct likely to cause alarm 
or distress and that keeping his pack at the compound was reasonable.

She believed neighbours had 'unreasonably low tolerance or unreasonably high sensitivity' to his animals and lifestyle.

She concluded by saying: 'In my 
view...the respondent’s lifestyle is deserving of respect whether or not
it falls within the legal definition of "family life" and in my 
considered opinion, there is no justification for interference with the 
respondent’s lifestyle.'
