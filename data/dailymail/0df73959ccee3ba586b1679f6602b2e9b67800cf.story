Daniel Veness from Suffolk who was was ordered to attend a sex offenders program - but it was cancelled

A paedophile molested a sleeping five-year-old girl after his sex-offenders treatment was cancelled.

Daniel Veness, 23, was ordered to get urgent help after he was caught with 600 vile child pornography pictures on his computer.

But a lack of 'resources' meant that the scheme was scrapped.

Veness, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, filmed himself carrying out the sickening sex attack on the little girl as she slept.

He was jailed for two years eight months yesterday.

Judge David Goodin branded the pervert a danger to young girls.

The judge said it was 'a matter of great regret' that two years in to a three-year order Veness's treatment programme had not started.

Judge Goodin said this was initially because the offender had been on holiday.

But since then Veness had been given two start dates in March and October 2012 which had been called off because of 'insufficient resources'.

The paedophile was arrested in January after a shocked friend told police he had seen pornographic images of naked girls on Veness's mobile.

Officers found 46 indecent pictures of children on the phone as well as film footage Veness had taken of himself sexually assaulting the five-year-old as she was asleep.

The judge at Ipswich Crown Court imposed an extended licence period of three years because of the danger he poses to young girls

Veness admitted sexual touching, two offences of taking indecent pictures of a child and downloading indecent images of children.

He also admitted breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order and failing to notify police of a change in his address under the terms of the sex offenders' register.

As well as jailing him at Ipswich Crown Court, Judge Goodin also imposed an extended licence period of three years because of the danger he poses to young girls.

Veness was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register and made the subject of an indefinite sexual offences prevention order.

He had been given a caution for sexual activity with a girl under the age of 13 in November 2008, the court heard.

Last night the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said the case was 'distressing' and insisted that it was vital the treatment is carried out.

Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust have launched an investigation into why the paedophile's treatment was cancelled

Judge Goodin said the Thames Valley Treatment Programme had been a crucial part of a three-year community order imposed at the court in March 2011 after the indecent photos were found on Veness's computer.

'This is a programme of high repute which is known to have some effect,' he said.

Andrew Thompson, defending, said it was unfortunate that Veness had not received any help.

Mr Thompson said: 'We will never know if it would have directed him away from the behaviour that has brought him back before the court.'

Stuart Macdonald, director of Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust, today said they had launched an investigation in to the case.

Mr Macdonald said: 'Our thoughts are with the victim and family at this incredibly difficult time.

'It would be wrong to comment further at this stage as the case is yet to be fully investigated.

'All cases involving a serious further offence are reviewed robustly and rigorously by Norfolk and Suffolk Probation Trust and the National Offender Management Service.

'Where deficiencies in the management of risk of serious harm are identified, action is taken to address these.'

Jon Brown, head of strategy and development for sexual abuse at the NSPCC, said: 'This is a distressing case where an offender has been convicted twice and the level of abuse since his first conviction has clearly escalated.

'In these cases it is vital that treatment should always be carried out to prevent further abuse.

'We hope the victims have also been provided with support and treatment to help them through their traumatic experiences.'

If you are an adult and you have concerns about the safety of a child, you can call the NSPCC's helpline on 0808 800 5000.

If you are a child and you are worried about your safety, you can call ChildLine on 0800 1111.
