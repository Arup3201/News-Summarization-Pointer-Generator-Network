With her twinkling eyes and beaming smile, it is hard to believe Her Majesty will mark her 88th birthday tomorrow.

This portrait of the Queen, taken by celebrated British photographer David Bailey CBE, was released today ahead of the occasion.

It shows the monarch smiling at the camera - while donning a pearl necklace, earrings and a brooch.

'Kind eyes': This portrait of the Queen, taken by celebrated British photographer David Bailey, was released today ahead of her 88th birthday. It shows the monarch beaming at the camera in pearl jewellery and a dress

Her jewellery is accompanied by a simple dress by Angela Kelly, who has served as the Queen's personal assistant and senior dresser
since 2002.

The black-and-white photograph was taken at Buckingham Palace in March and commissioned on behalf of the Government's GREAT Britain campaign.

It was captured by 76-year-old Bailey, who has been photographing celebrities, royals and other famous people for more than 50 years.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'Bailey's name was suggested by Number 10 and the GREAT campaign and the Queen agreed.

'The Queen agreed to sit for it in recognition of the work of the GREAT campaign.'

Bailey, whose previous subjects have included Diana, Princess of Wales, the Beatles, Sir Mick Jagger and model Kate Moss, said he had always been a 'huge fan' of the Queen.

'She has very kind eyes with a mischievous glint,' he said. 'I've 
always liked strong women and she is a very strong woman.'

The GREAT Britain campaign aims to generate jobs and 
growth through highlighting the UK as a world-class destination for 
trade, tourism, investment and education.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'The Government's GREAT campaign is promoting Britain as a world-class destination for trade, tourism, investment and education.

'The portrait of Her Majesty The Queen by renowned photographer David Bailey CBE, celebrates her 88th birthday and supports the aims of the campaign, to showcase everything that is great about the UK to an international audience.'

It is hoped the image will encourage overseas visitors to experience the country's royal heritage.

Britain's monarchy, including royal heritage and property, is one of the biggest drivers of tourism into the UK, generating an estimated £500 million per year from overseas tourism spend.

The Royal Family has given strong support to the campaign over the last two years - and the latest portrait of the Queen continues that support.

The campaign has delivered economic returns worth more than £500million to the economy - with a further £600-£800m of returns forecast from activity in 2013-14.

It is the Government's most ambitious international marketing campaign, showcasing the best of what Britain has to offer in order to encourage the world to visit, study and do business with the country.

Launched by the Prime Minister in September 2011, the initiative is a global campaign, deployed by Britain's diplomatic posts in 144 countries around the world.

Renowned: David Bailey was the photographer behind the portrait of the Queen, released today to mark her 88th birthday tomorrow

David Bailey was the acclaimed photographer behind the portrait of the Queen, released today to mark her 88th birthday tomorrow.

Over the past 50 years, the 76-year-old has become a star in the
 same league as many of the personalities whose images he has captured.

Some
 of his most celebrated works have featured the East End criminals the 
Kray twins, model Jean Shrimpton, who was a former girlfriend, actor 
Terence Stamp, the Beatles, Sir Mick Jagger and model Kate Moss.

Bailey,
 who grew up in the east end of London, made his name in the 1960s as 
one of a group of young photographers, including Terence Donovan, who 
documented the era in the capital and rubbed shoulders with stars from 
the worlds of the arts and fashion.

He
 graduated from being an assistant with fashion photographer John French
 in 1959, and gained fame working for Vogue magazine, emerging as a 
chronicler of the Swinging Sixties, providing lasting images of a decade
 of change.

Celebrities he 
has photographed include Diana, Princess of Wales, Naomi Campbell, Jack 
Nicholson, Sir Michael Caine, Johnny Depp, Andy Warhol and Francis 
Bacon.

Bailey, whose four 
wives have included French actress Catherine Deneuve and model Marie 
Helvin, was appointed a CBE in the Birthday Honours list of 2001 for 
services to art.

His lengthy
 career is currently the subject of a major exhibition, Bailey's 
Stardust, at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which is 
displaying 250 works chosen by the photographer.
