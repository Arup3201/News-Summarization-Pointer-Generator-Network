Scotland Yard detectives have flown to Spain to investigate whether Madeleine McCann was abducted and smuggled across the border from Portugal before being delivered to a Victoria Beckham lookalike.

The officers, who visited Barcelona last month, are believed to be re-examining reports that the well-dressed woman asked businessman at the city's marina if he was there to deliver her 'new daughter' shortly after the youngster's disappearance.

The man, who was chaperoning his brother on a stag party, was too shocked to reply and the woman repeated the question twice more. A second member of the party also spoke to the woman before she left.

Madeleine was nearly four when she 
went missing from her family's holiday flat in Praia da Luz in the 
Algarve on May 3, 2007 as her parents Kate and Gerry dined with friends 
nearby. The incident with the woman happened on May 7.

The theory is that the child may have been snatched by a paedophile gang and smuggled into Spain – an hour’s drive away from her family’s holiday flat.

Private detectives hired by the McCanns have always believed that the suspicious incident in the Spanish port could be significant.

They made a public appeal for information about the woman, said to have an Australian or New Zealand accent and able to speak fluent Spanish, who approached the Britons drinking in a bar at 2am.

One man was approached by the woman, who was reportedly between 30 and 35, in the belief that he was someone she was expecting to meet.He described her as appearing ‘agitated’.

Madeleine, from Rothley, 
Leicestershire, vanished from the Algarve holiday resort four years ago.
 She was asleep in the family's holiday apartment with her brother and 
sister when she vanished shortly before her fourth birthday.

The detectives who flew to Barcelona 
spent three days with their Spanish colleagues and are among 30 
Metropolitan Police officers carrying out a review of her case. They are
 also examining possible sightings of Madeleine after she vanished.

There were a number of sightings of 
children matching her description in Spain shortly after she 
disappeared, and Portuguese authorities were criticised for not alerting
 border and police officials until 12 hours after she went missing.

In July, Scotland Yard said it would 
examine all the evidence connected to the case, including material 
gathered by private investigators, after a request by David Cameron.

Detectives then spent months reading a huge file of case material that had to be translated from Portuguese to English.

Yesterday police played down any 
suggestion of a breakthrough in the case, but Madeleine’s parents Kate 
and Gerry McCann said they were ‘pleased that the review is making 
progress’.

A Met police spokesman said: ‘There has been very good co-operation with Portuguese authorities and liaison will continue.

‘Officers have travelled to Portugal 
three times in connection with the investigative review, and three 
officers travelled to Barcelona. They are continuing to discuss how to 
take it forward and we are hopeful that we will be able to do that.’
