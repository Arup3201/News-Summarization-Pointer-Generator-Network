Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng wrote how she had ‘warm feelings’ like a ‘crush’ for Tony Blair, it was reported yesterday.

The note was found after the 82-year-old media tycoon discovered the former Labour prime minister had spent weekends at his homes.

Mr Murdoch later filed for divorce from Miss Deng, 44.

The note was apparently written by Miss Deng to herself, expressing her ‘warm feelings’ comparable to a ‘crush’ on Mr Blair, who is married to barrister and part-time judge Cherie.

Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng divorced two weeks ago following reports that she had met with Middle East envoy Mr Blair, 60, without his knowledge.

Their meetings are understood to include ‘multiple’ overnight stays at Mr Murdoch’s homes, including his ranch in Carmel, California.

The pair are also understood to have met on a super-yacht owned by music industry billionaire David Geffen.

Such is the extent of the ‘terminal’ rift between the former allies and friends that Mr Blair was forced to avoid the prestigious US Sun Valley conference in July, where he had top billing, because Mr Murdoch objected to his presence, The Mail on Sunday reported.

The media finance event was attended by influential figures such as Mr Murdoch, Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Mr Blair, who is godfather to one of Mr Murdoch and Miss Deng’s children, has been a regular guest at Sun Valley, attending the 2007 gathering just two weeks after leaving Downing Street.

Friends of Mr Murdoch insist that he ‘did not act lightly’ before ending his 14-year marriage to Miss Deng and his 20-year political and personal friendship with Mr Blair.

A media executive who has known Mr Murdoch for 40 years said: ‘Rupert has supported Tony politically and personally through thick and thin.

‘He thought he could trust him, but he was wrong.’

Another friend said: ‘What really hurt was finding out that Tony had been in his homes without telling him.’

It is understood that Mr Murdoch learned of his ex-wife and Mr Blair’s encounters after  she inadvertently sent an email to the wrong person, including details of his trip to the ranch.

Mr Murdoch then went to Carmel and asked the household staff if it was true. They told him Mr Blair had stayed there with Miss Deng on two weekends in October 2012 and April this year. Mr Blair visited with his British police bodyguards.

There is no evidence of an affair between Mr Blair and Miss Deng.

Last night, Mr Blair and his office refused to comment.
