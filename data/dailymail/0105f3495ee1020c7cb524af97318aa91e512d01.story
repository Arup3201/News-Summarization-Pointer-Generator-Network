A woman has finally fulfilled her New Year's resolution by shedding nine stone after being given a personal trainer as a Christmas gift.

Every year Denise Winwood, 54, from Nottingham, made it her mission to lose weight this year but never quite managed it.

This year, however, she will finally be celebrating after her weight plummeted from more than 20 stone to just 11st.

Superslimmer: Denise Winwood, 54, has finally achieved her New Year's resolution of losing weight

Much better: Denise spent years battling with her weight and has now lost an impressive nine stone

The administration officer has battled with her weight since she was a teenager and has spent most of her life fluctuating between a size 20 and 26.

Now, thanks to husband Robert who hired her a personal trainer as a Christmas present last year, Denise is a svelte size 12 and couldn't be happier.

'I am a new woman now, both physically and mentally,' she revealed. 'I have amazed myself with what I have been able to achieve with the help of my personal trainer.

'I had tried dieting before, but when you weigh 20 stone you need to lose three before it even looks any different. After losing a few stone I would give up and put the weight back on and more.'

The turning point for Denise came after she was turned down for her dream job and decided to do something for herself.

She joined the gym in August 2011 and had lost three stone by December 2012, but her weight loss plateaued.

Since losing weight, Denise has completed a half marathon and can play with her grandchildren

So when her husband asked what she wanted for Christmas, Denise mentioned for a personal training session.

'When I joined the gym, it was the first time in 25 years,' she remembers. 'I lost three stone and felt incredible.

'But I started to get disheartened when the weight stopped coming off so I asked for a personal trainer. With Dan's help, I lost another five and a half stone.

'I must say it was tough. I worked hard and was disciplined, both in exercise and what I ate. With Dan's encouragement, his belief in me, his guidance and monitoring my nutrition, I was constantly being challenged and constantly moving forward.'

She added: 'For the first time in my life I feel good about myself. I feel so fit. I can do things I never imagined I would be able to do, especially running.'

Since losing the weight, Denise has run a half marathon in two hours and 37 minutes and is fit enough to play with her three grandchildren at the park.

She now hopes her story will inspire others to lose weight in 2014. 'I want people to think that they can do it too,' she explained.

'When I was nine stone overweight, losing a stone never showed. You had to lose three stones before anyone noticed. It's a big challenge.

'Many times I would lose three stones and would put it all back on again. It's a long journey. I thought I'm never going to do this. But I have.'
