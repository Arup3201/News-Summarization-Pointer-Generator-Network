Two men were arrested today on suspicion of murdering a teenage girl who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago.

Paige Chivers was aged 15 when she disappeared in August 2007 after a row with her father at their seaside home in Blackpool, Lancashire.

But despite appeals from police, the girl’s family and even TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle - plus the offer of a £30,000 reward - she has never been found.

The investigation into the 
disappearance of Paige - whose mother Sheila died of a heart attack aged
 48, six months before she vanished - is now being treated as a ‘murder 
without a body’.

Lancashire 
Police said today that the two suspects were being held on suspicion of 
murdering Paige and attempting to pervert the course of justice 
following dawn raids.

The pair aged 45 and 59 are being held in custody at an undisclosed police station in the county.

Paige
 - who attended Montgomery High School in Blackpool - lived with her 
late father, Frank, a builder, and brother, Jack, but was ‘very 
troubled and angry’ over her mother’s death.

She left home 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father over the spending of some family money. Paige packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on August 23.

Disappearance: The inquiry into what happened to Paige remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police's history

Police believe that after leaving 
home, she went to the home of a middle-aged man in the nearby village of
 Bispham, to whom she had been introduced by a teenage friend.

The man was said to have told 
Paige that she could not stay at his home. He claims he walked her to a 
nearby bus stop and told her to go to a local drop-in hostel for 
troubled children.

But she never arrived and has not been seen since. The last confirmed sighting of her by her family was that day getting on a number 11 bus.

Detectives received a letter from a mystery person who claimed to know what had happened to the teenager. Police did not reveal the contents of the anonymous note but urged the person who sent it to get in touch.

During the inquiry three men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of Paige’s murder - but all were released without charge.

The inquiry remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police’s history, with more than 2,800 people spoken to as part of the inquiry and over 1,200 statements taken.

The investigation has been extended to Peterlee in the North East and the Bolton area where Paige is known to have friends - plus Sheffield, Nottingham, Croydon and the south coast.

Police frogman have searched a lake and ponds in the Blackpool area.

During a 2010 appeal when Paige would have turned 18, sister Maddison Houghton - who gave birth to a son Connor just days after the teenager vanished - said: ‘All my brothers and sisters are all missing Paige like crazy, and we want her to come home. Paige is very outgoing, she just loved everybody, and very caring.

'You could hear her from everywhere - you could hear her half way down the street. When our mum died Paige couldn’t handle things and she kept it all inside, I think she probably just couldn’t talk about it and decided to go.

‘We just need her to come home so we can scatter my mum’s ashes and we don’t want to do that without her. I really want her to meet Conner because he’s her nephew and she hasn’t seen him and she’d adore him.

‘She had some money inherited in my mum’s will which she can get on her 18th birthday. I just want to make sure and let her know that it’s safe and in the bank and ready for her when she comes home.’

In June police searched land near where she was last seen after receiving new information, but nothing was found.

A £30,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of Paige's killer or the recovery of her body has been on offer.

A Lancashire Police spokesman said today: ‘Detectives investigating the murder of Blackpool teenager Paige Chivers have this morning arrested two men.

‘The men, aged 45 and 59, from Blackpool, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice and will now be questioned by detectives.’
