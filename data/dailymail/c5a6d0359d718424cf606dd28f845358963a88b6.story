A British trekker has frozen to death while crossing Greenland in what he had called a ‘frankly nutty adventure’.

Novice explorer Philip Goodeve-Docker, 30, was sheltering in a tent with two fellow trekkers as a storm with winds of up to 95mph howled across the ice.

The gales ripped away part of the tent, leaving the three men exposed to the freezing gale. They radioed for help, but it took rescue teams 24 hours to find them.

Tragic: Philip Goodeve-Docker, 30, froze to death after being caught in a bitter storm in Greenland

Chief Inspector Paul Pitersen, of 
Greenland police, said: ‘By the time we got to them Mr Goodeve-Docker 
had frozen to death. They were very unlucky. They were simply in the 
wrong place at the wrong time.’

His friends, Andy Norman and Roan Hackney, were rescued and are being treated in hospital for frostbite and other injuries.

Mr Goodeve-Docker left his home in 
Ealing, West London, last Thursday for the trip with experienced 
expedition leader Mr Hackney and Mr Norman, 33, a former IT 
professional.

He was raising money for charity and 
dedicated the trip to the memory of his grandfather, a former vice- 
president of the Royal Geographical Society who died in 2011.

His family, of Stockbridge, 
Hampshire, were yesterday too upset to comment. They wrote on his 
Facebook page: ‘On Sunday morning we had a phone call to confirm that 
Philip sadly died. To our son, brother and friend, we are so glad that 
you were on your adventure and expedition that you had wanted to do for 
so long.

‘You will be unbelievably missed.’

Ambition: The trio were crossing the Greenland ice cap with two friends on a 'trip of a lifetime' when the group got into trouble

Mr Goodeve-Docker, who was embarking 
on his first trip and had been ‘training furiously’, wrote about the 
dangers of one of the most ‘deadly landscapes in the world’.

The events manager estimated the trek
from east to west across the Greenland ice sheet, the world’s second 
largest, would take 30 to 35 days. 

He wrote: ‘We will travel 550-600km 
across one of the most dazzling,  beautiful, yet barren and deadly 
landscapes in the world, dragging all our own supplies (between 
100-135kg).

‘This is one of the great polar 
challenges, through which we face such dangers as polar bears (not cute 
and cuddly), crevasses up to 500+ metres deep, polar winds, temperatures
of 5C to -50C, plus the horror of three men with one tent and no 
washing.

‘Part of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.’

Mr Pirie-Gordon, who had helped fund 
polar exploration as treasurer and honorary vice-president of the Royal 
Geographical Society, was also treasurer of the QNI (Queen’s Nursing 
Institute), the charity for which his grandson hoped to raise money.

More than £5,000 worth of donations continued to pour into his JustGiving charity website yesterday.

One person wrote: ‘Would have paid any money to have you back my friend, still can’t believe you are gone.’

Desperate: They radioed for help, but it took rescuers 24 hours to locate them on a glacier in Greenland

Another added: ‘In memory, you made a difference and lived large!!’

Experts suggested the expedition was hit by what are called katabatic winds, which can exceed 100mph.

Billy Payne, a forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, said gusts of 95mph were reported on the east coast of 
Greenland on Saturday evening.

Temperatures fell to minus 5C (23F), or minus 14C (7F) with wind chill.

‘It is likely the interior (of 
Greenland) would be much colder. These sorts of winds obviously are 
dangerously high,’ he said. Mr Norman, from Ascot, Berkshire, had said 
the temperature on the first day was around minus 20C (minus 4F) but was
expected to hit minus 35C (minus 31F) overnight.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We 
are aware British nationals were in difficulty during an expedition in 
Greenland. Sadly one of the men, Philip Goodeve-Docker, died.

‘We are providing consular assistance to their families.’
