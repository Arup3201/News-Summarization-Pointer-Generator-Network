Callum McManaman passed his medical at West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday as his move from Wigan draws closer to completion.

The £4.75million deal is expected to be announced on Wednesday, with the 23-year-old winger set to make his Albion debut in the Premier League clash against Tottenham on Saturday.

McManaman will become Tony Pulis's first signing as the former Crystal Palace boss strengthens his squad for the second half of the season.

Tony Pulis wants at least one wide man at West Brom and McManaman is his top target

Pulis is desperate to bring in at least one quick wide player this window. 

After beating Birmingham in the FA Cup, he said: 'There are certain weaknesses in the team, unbalanced in a way that we have to sort it out. 

'We have to put certain things in place so we can be good in possession and out of possession. It's a massive ten days for the football club, I hope and pray things drop for us.'
