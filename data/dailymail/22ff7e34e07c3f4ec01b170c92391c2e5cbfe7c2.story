Auditors have warned that Iain Duncan Smith¿s flagship welfare reform has got off to a disastrous start and should be delayed to prevent further losses to the taxpayer

Iain Duncan Smith today sought to pin the blame for the disastrous start of his flagship welfare reforms on inept civil servants.

The Work and Pensions Secretary said he 'lost faith' in his own civil servants running the huge Universal Credit project.

He accused them of 'just wanting to be able to say it was going well' even as the £2.4billion project hit problems.

In a devastating report the National Audit Office says Universal Credit is beset by ‘weak management, ineffective control and poor governance’.

The scheme, which will replace a string of out-of-work benefits, is designed to ensure that it always pays people to take a job or work more hours.

But auditors warn that the £2.4billion project has ‘not achieved value for money’, partly because of unrealistic timetables imposed by ministers.

A £425million IT system is still not working properly and £34million of equipment has already been written off.

The NAO says the scheme ‘still has the potential to create significant benefits for society’. 

But it suggests the deadline for rolling out the scheme by 2017 may have to be put back, adding that the Department for Work and Pensions ‘must scale back its delivery ambition and set out realistic plans’.

The findings are a major blow to Mr Duncan Smith, who has staked his reputation on delivering the complex project on time.

The minister is expected to be called to Parliament today to answer questions from MPs about why he repeatedly told the Commons the project was on track while knowing it was at risk of collapse.

But Mr Duncan Smith today claimed he could have written the report himself.

He told the BBC: 'I lost faith in the ability of the civil servants to be able to manage this programme.

'So we brought in people from outside, we brought in the Cabinet Office, working with my colleagues, to ensure that this programme could be delivered within the scope of how it was planned and make sure that it was delivered within budget – not going back to the Treasury for any more money.'

He added that the officials 'charged with putting in place the IT didn't make the correct decisions'.

Having invested in the wrong systems, there was then a refusal to admit there was a problem, he added.

'There was a sense that somehow they just wanted to be able to say it was all going well,' Mr Duncan Smith said.

They pointed to warnings in today’s report that some of those working on the project had developed a ‘fortress mentality’ and ‘a 'good news' reporting culture’, leaving ministers in the dark about any problems.

But Labour will demand that Mr Duncan Smith comes to the Commons to explain why the project has gone so badly off course.

He is likely to be asked why he continued to issue public assurances that the scheme was on track when senior officials across Whitehall were privately warning him of ‘serious concerns’.

In a withering assessment, today’s report says: ‘Throughout the programme the DWP has lacked a detailed view of how Universal Credit is meant to work.

‘The department was warned repeatedly about the lack of a detailed “blueprint” … for Universal Credit.’ 

It adds: ‘The department has delayed rolling out Universal Credit to claimants, has had weak control of the programme, and has been unable to assess the value of the systems it spent over £300million to develop.’

The NAO raises wider concerns about the department’s ability to ‘deal with weak programme management, over-optimistic timescales and a lack of openness about progress’.

It also says Universal Credit’s IT system ‘lacks a component to identify potentially fraudulent claims’. 

Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman said: ‘Mr Duncan Smith swore blind this benefit shake-up was fine. Now we learn he has completely lost control of his department at a potential cost of hundreds of millions of pounds.’ 

A DWP spokesman said the report did not cover ‘significant’ progress made since April when a former Olympics chief was brought in to ‘reset’ the project.
