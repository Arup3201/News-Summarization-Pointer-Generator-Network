A gay couple who wed earlier this month on a Maryland airfield after more than 20 years together have secured a legal victory which means their marriage is recognized in their home state of Ohio.

The decision by federal judge Timothy Black to grant John Arthur and his husband Jim Obergefell a temporary restraining order against the 2004 Ohio law banning recognition of their marriage came despite a warning from the state's attorney general that it could contribute to a broad rewriting of Ohio law in favor of such unions, which are currently banned in the state.

The victory has added significance for the couple because Arthur is expected to die soon from Lou Gehrig's disease and the decision means his death certificate will show that he was married and that James Obergefell is his surviving spouse.

The ruling also means the pair can be buried next to each other in Arthur's family plot, located at a cemetery that only allows descendants and spouses.

The couple filed a lawsuit on Friday against Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Attorney General Mike DeWine and a Cincinnati official responsible for filing death certificates which stated that ‘they very much want the world to officially remember and record their union as a married couple’.

Though Black's order was specific to the couple's case, opponents of Ohio's ban on gay marriage were encouraged by it.

‘This is one more step toward marriage equality in the state of Ohio,’ said the couple's attorney, Al Gerhardstein, who said he's gotten calls from other same-sex couples who married in other states and are exploring their options to have their marriage recognized in Ohio.

Only Jim Obergefell was in court last Friday to file the lawsuit as his husband John Arthur is seriously ill and close to death

He said that when he told Arthur and Obergefell about Monday's ruling, they were overjoyed.

‘This is more than just a legal form,’ Gerhardstein said.

‘It's the state where these men have built their lives, the city where they built their lives, finally turning to them and saying, “Yes, we do recognize that you're a couple as much as any opposite-sex couple and that your life and now your death will be honored in a way that other married couples would be treated.’”

The couple, determined to marry before Arthur died, flew in a special jet with medical equipment to Maryland, which recognizes gay marriage.

They wed July 11 inside the plane on an airport tarmac before returning to Cincinnati the same day, according to court records.

In his ruling, Black said that historically, Ohio law has recognized out-of-state marriages as valid as long as they were legal where they took place, pointing to marriages between cousins and involving minors.

‘How then can Ohio, especially given the historical status of Ohio law, single out same-sex marriages as ones it will not recognize?’ Black wrote. ‘The short answer is that Ohio cannot.’

DeWine's spokesman, Dan Tierney, said in a statement that ‘this is a temporary ruling at a preliminary stage under sad circumstances.’

He said DeWine's office will defend the right of Ohioans to define marriage and that the U.S. Supreme Court has recently emphasized that it is a definition that traditionally lies with states.

‘Ohio's voters are entitled to the choice they have made on this fundamental issue,’ he said.

Kasich spokesman Robert Nichols said in a statement that the office doesn't comment on pending litigation, ‘other than to say that the governor believes that marriage is between a man and a woman.’

Black wrote that the couple would experience irreparable harm without his timely ruling.

‘The uncertainty around this issue during Mr. Arthur's final illness is the cause of extreme emotional hardship to the couple,’ Black wrote.

‘Dying with an incorrect death certificate that prohibits Mr. Arthur from being buried with dignity constitutes irreparable harm.’

Together: The couple, pictured with Arthur's aunt - who married them - decided to exchange vows after the Defense of Marriage Act was defeated by the Supreme Court but could still not do it in Ohio

In an emotional ceremony, John Arthur married Jim Obergefell from his stretcher earlier this month - just two weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act.

'I'm overjoyed,' Arthur told The Cincinnati Enquirer after the ceremony. 'I'm very 
proud to be an American and be able to openly share my love for the 
record. I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.'

When faced with where to go, their options were limited due to Arthur's amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - or ALS - a 
progressive neurological disease that affects patients' speech and movement, and eventually their breathing. He is bedridden and had not left their home since March.

They decided to marry in Maryland as only one
 partner had to go for the license before both went for the wedding. Arthur knew he would be unable to make the journey twice.

They chartered a small medical plane which cost $12,700 to rent with the help of generous donations from relatives and friends - and people they barely knew.

Obergefell flew to Baltimore before the ceremony to obtain the marriage license and flew back just two days later with Arthur so their lengthy relationship could finally be legally recognized.

John
 Arthur suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or
 Lou Gehrig's disease after the baseball player who had the illness.

In
 sufferers of the disease, nerve cells waste away or die, which leads to
 muscle weakening, twitching and an inability to move limbs.

The condition means it is impossible to carry out day-to-day tasks such as walking or swallowing.

As
 the condition worsens, the muscles in the chest area stop working and 
it becomes hard for the sufferer to breathe on their own.

The disease in incurable and 90 per cent of sufferers die within three to five years of their diagnosis.

The condition affects around five in 100,000 people worldwide.

After the 90-minute flight, they arrived in Baltimore with a nurse, two pilots and Arthur's aunt, Paulette Roberts, who had been ordained to marry the two men.

Remaining inside the plane, they listened to Roberts speak as they gripped hands.

'Twenty-six months ago John was diagnosed with ALS,' she said. 'Since then the amazing relationship between John and Jim has become even closer, even more devoted, even more loving - and it was pretty damn great before John became ill.'

After the seven-and-a-half minute ceremony was finished, they drank Champagne and headed back to Cincinnati, finally legally recognized as married - although they had felt they were for years.

'In our minds we've always been married, 
but now I can actually say John's my husband and have a piece of paper, 
and a Supreme Court ruling, and a federal government that says yes, he 
is your husband,' Obergefell told the Enquirer.

'I'm overjoyed that we’ll now have a 
piece of paper that confirms what we've always known in our hearts - 
that we're an old, married couple who still love each other.'

The
 couple met twice through a friend in 1992 before meeting again at a New
 Year's Eve party and experiencing 'love at third sight'.

Within weeks, they had swapped rings and months later they moved in together.

Just over two years ago, Arthur felt his 
left leg dragging during a trip to Finland, and when he returned to the 
U.S., he was promptly diagnosed with ALS.

His

 condition has worsened and is no longer able to walk. There is no cure 
for the illness, which eventually affects breathing and claims the 
sufferer's life within two to five years after diagnosis.

With
 the onset of Arthur's illness, the couple felt the weight of not being 
able to marry; some employers did not allow them to share a health 
insurance policy, and they had to prepare powers of attorney, which they
 would not need had they been able to marry.

They also sold their home and put their new one in Obergefell's name to avoid future problems.

Although their exact rights have not yet been defined, when DOMA was defeated they knew it was time to get married - and devised their plan.

'Had the Supreme Court made this decision one year ago, this would've been as simple as us taking a trip because I could still walk,' Arthur said ahead of the marriage.

'It's the progression for me of the ALS, it's just compounded everything. I don't live in a world of regret but I sure wish we were a year in the past.'

Next year, residents of Ohio will most likely be able to vote on whether to repeal the 2004 ban on gay marriage.
