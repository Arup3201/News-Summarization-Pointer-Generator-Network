A family is celebrating the arrival of a baby who represents the fifth generation of their family - for the second time

There’s more than 90 years between 15-week-old Ada Kate Smith and her great-great grandmother Evelyn Guy, who is 93.

Incredibly, it's the second time the family have had five generations alive at once - the last time being when Ada’s father Daniel, 33, was born.

One for the family album! Five generations of the same family (from left) Raymond Guy, 73, Lesley Smith, 53, Daniel Smith, 33, Evelyn Guy, 93 and 15-week-old Ada Kate Smith celebrate the new arrival

However, just three years later they sadly returned to four generations following the death of David Parry.

He reached the grand old age of 96 when he died in 1984, and was pictured in the original newspaper photograph holding baby Daniel.

The family, who all come from Preston, Lancashire, but now live across the country, got together for photograph of the momentous occasion.

The next generation down from Evelyn is her son Raymond Guy, 73, who now lives in Kendal, Cumbria, followed by daughter Lesley Mitchell, 52, who now lives in Wales.

Lesley's son Daniel Smith, 33, lives in Nottingham, and finally Daniel’s daughter.

Evelyn, who moved to Preston in 1939 but now lives in sheltered accommodation in Ashton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I am very proud of them all, they have all done so well.'

We've done it before! An article from the local paper from when the family marked its first five-generation milestone with the birth of Daniel Smith 33 years ago

Raymond, who used to work as a sales rep for Nestle, said: 'As a family, we are just very good at breeding!

'I would say we're quite a healthy family, we look after ourselves. But I would say the longevity comes from my mum's side.

'My dad's parents unfortunately didn't last as long so it must be my mum with the good genes.

'I think it's very unlikely we'll get to six generations. I've already told Daniel he'll have to hurry up and marry Ada off but that will mean me living until 100, I think!

'We're absolutely over the moon though, we think it's a lovely achievement for our family to make.'

Daniel said: 'I wanted us to get together and have the photo, it was quite unusual to have five generations when I was born and now it’s happened again with Ada.

'It’s really lovely, a special day in many ways.'

Evelyn has two sons, six grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
