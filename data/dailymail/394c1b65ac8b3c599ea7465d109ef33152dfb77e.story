Adam Lallana is beginning to settle on the pitch at Liverpool but the midfielder has encountered difficulties off it in one of the most bizarre circumstances.

The 26-year-old recently had his car vandalised by baboons during a family trip with his two-year-old son Arthur to Knowsley Safari Park on Merseyside.

The £25million summer signing was driving his car through the monkey enclosure when the animals pounced upon his vehicle.

Despite the act of destruction to his car, Lallana could see the funny side.

'I went to Knowsley Safari Park with my little boy recently and ended up coming back with bits of the car missing from going into the monkey bit, so I won't be going back there in a rush.' he told the Daily Star.

After an initial slow start to the season with  Liverpool due to injury, the former Southampton captain has become a regular fixture in Brendan Rodgers' first-team picture, having made 11 appearances for the Reds so far.

And Lallana, who is in line to feature in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off away to Newcastle, attributes his relatively smooth transition at Anfield to being happy with his new northern surroundings.

'I'm settling in well. I've got my family up here, which always helps,' he added.

'I can't complain and after my injury, I'm just delighted to be back playing.'
