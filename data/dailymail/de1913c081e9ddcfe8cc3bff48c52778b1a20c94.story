The German and French media have responded to their respective World Cup fates in typically dramatically fashion following their quarter-final clash on Saturday.

Mats Hummels scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory for the Germans, with their media lauding him as the hero of the day, whilst the inquiry into defeat begins in France.

The likes of the Hamburg Morning Post and sports newspaper Bild have been full of praise for the defender who led them to their fourth World Cup semi-final in a row.

Bild: The German sports paper runs with similar themes, celebrating their passage to the semi-finals

Whereas French papers L'Equipe and Vaucluse are, understandably, in a far more sombre mood - with plenty of mention of the dream being over.

Undoubtedly, the scrutinizing of their defeat will continue over the coming days.

Meanwhile, other sections of the German press are now looking forward to Joachim Low's side's semi-final against Brazil, who will be without the injured Neymar.

On Die Zeit's website they claim the loss of the 22-year-old striker is 'is similar to Germany losing [Manuel] Neuer, [Phillipp] Lahm, [Mats] Hummels, [Jerome] Boateng, [Benedikt] Howedes, [Bastian] Schweinsteiger, [Sami] Khedira, [Toni] Kroos, [Mesut] Ozil, [Thomas] Muller, and [Miroslav) Klose.

Der Spiegel, meanwhile, claim Brazil 'will not be able to replace Neymar' and that they 'now have four days to think about a plan how to cope with.'
