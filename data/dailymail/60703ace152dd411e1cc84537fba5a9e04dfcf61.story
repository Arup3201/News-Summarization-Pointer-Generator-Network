Bathroom break-ins: Residents in a block of flats in Sweden have had their homes broken in to, only for the culprit to use their toilet

A series of break-ins in a block of flats in a small town in Sweden has left police baffled, as it appears the culprit has only needed to use the bathroom.

Instead of raiding the homes of valuables, the culprit has been defecating without flushing and leaving behind boxes of teabags in flats in Mariestad, south-west Sweden.

Residents have spoken of feeling violated and terrified after the mystery person paid them several visits, defecating in their homes, leaving everything else untouched.

After first blaming their partners or forgetfulness, residents realised that they were all being visited by the same person, now referred to as ‘the poop man’ in local newspapers.

‘Someone walks in when you are not at home, s****, and walks out again,' victim Markus Andersson, 25, told GT.se.

'I didn’t believe it at first, but now I’ve understood it’s been happening to my neighbours as well.'

For the past few months, several flats in the block have been visited by a person who uses their bathroom without flushing, and then leaves.

Mr Andersson first blamed his partner, Maria Gard, 22, but after it happened another three times, they realised it was neither of them, complained to the landlord and had their locks changed.

Their neighbour, Emmeli Johansson, 22, has also been paid several visits by ’the poop man’, and she says the last time, things escalated.

‘It started two months ago and has happened maybe four times, and on Monday when I came home from work it got worse.’

Ms Johansson says she found three boxes of tea in her kitchen, which she had not bought, and her games console was hidden between two packets of biscuits.

When she went to get her locks change this week, she found out that a third neighbour was also a victim.

The doors to all the flats have been locked, but there have been no signs of forced entry, indicating that the culprit has access to the main key.

‘It is a very aggressive action which should be taken very seriously,' says psychiatrist and criminal profiler Ulf Åsgård.

'The perpetrator knows when the resident is away from the property and perhaps also how long.'

Mr Åsgård believes that the culprit is most likely male, living in the neighbourhood and looking to feel power over his victims, which appear to have been chosen at random.

The landlord is now in the process of installing new locks in the buildings to keep their tenants’ bathrooms safe.
