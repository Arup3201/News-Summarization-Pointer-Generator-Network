As a way of easing the burden on waiting staff, it’s an idea that could certainly get off the ground.

The Yo! Sushi chain of restaurants is trialling a mini helicopter to serve its customers.

The gadget has four rotors and can travel at up to 25 miles an hour – or more than six times a waiter’s usual walking speed.

A sushi restaurant is trialling the delivery of food to customers' tables with the world's first flying tray

Waiters can now whizz the iTray over tables and between chairs at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour, or six times faster than they usually walk

Known as the iTray, it is controlled with an iPad, which restaurant staff tip in the direction they want the food to travel.

Staff load the tray, fly it to a customer’s table up to 50 yards away, and return it when they see the food has been removed.

Currently there are just two of the devices in operation, at the chain’s Soho branch in central London.

If it proves popular it could be rolled out to all 64 of Yo! Sushi’s UK restaurants next year.

It is not Yo! Sushi’s only foray into
 automated food delivery. It was the first UK chain to introduce 
conveyor belt service and speaking robot drinks trolleys

The company launched the iTray to mark the release of their new burger, which replaces the traditional bun with Japanese toasted rice

Waitress Gabriella Micu, 28, said: 
‘It’s really fun for customers and I hope we can get to the point where 
we can serve guests from the central kitchen as it would definitely help
 to cut down the time walking around the restaurant.’

The iTray is made from a light-weight carbon fibre frame. YO! Sushi said it currently has two models in operation.

The company claims it has launched the iTray to mark the release of their new burger, which replaces the traditional bun with Japanese toasted rice.

The beef patty is also substituted for teriyaki chicken, kimchi salmon, prawn katsu, tilapia katsu (whitefish) or tofu katsu.

Customer Mark Love, 26, from London, said: 'When I ordered the burger I never imagined it would come flying towards me on a tray.

'It was amazing and the weirdest thing, like something out of a science fiction novel. It was delivered as if by magic, like an alien flying saucer bringing food directly onto my table.'

Robin Rowland, CEO of YO! Sushi, said: 'We brought the famous kaiten conveyor belt to the UK, introduced interactive call buttons, speaking robot drinks trolleys, self-heating plates and video game toilets.

'Now we have introduced the iTray, which is great fun.'

Mike Lewis, YO! Sushi executive chef, said: 'We've been training our Soho team for several weeks now to get used to working with our new flying friend.

'With the YO! Burger, we wanted to introduce our customers something entirely new, inspired by Japan and exclusive to us.

'It's taken several months to develop, a raft of new kitchen equipment, but with the YO! Burger and iTray we know guests will feel like they've had a taste of the future.'
