A 33-year-old banker has been jailed for seven years after sexually assaulting two girlfriends with a lacrosse stick, in a sickening attack that he also filmed.

New Yorker Daniel Brown, who earned $120,000 a year at Sovereign Bank, pleaded guilty to  rape, aggravated sex abuse, assault and stalking in February.

His victims, professionals in their 20s, had agreed to him filming their sexual encounters at his West 57th Street apartment in 2010 and 2011, which then turned unexpectedly violent.

When police raided Brown's apartment they found at least 100 videotapes documenting the violent encounters.

The women can be heard screaming in pain on the tapes, as they were assaulted by objects including Brown's lacrosse stick.

'You ruined my Thursday night!' Brown can be heard shouting in one videotape.

The woman contacted the police separately.Â 

The first came forward after about a year of repeated abuse. Both women had continued to date Brown despite the attacks.

One of the women said Brown had punched her, smashed her face into a mirror and rammed his fist down her throat to make her throw up.

When Justice Charles Solomon at Manhattan Supreme Court asked him if he had anything to say for himself Brown kept his head down and said: 'No thank you.'

The former banker, who has been in custody since 2011, must register as a sex offender and serve ten years' probation when he is released.
