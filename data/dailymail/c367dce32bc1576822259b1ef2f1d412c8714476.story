A stomach-turning video has surfaced of an MH370 search vessel being tossed around the ocean amid tropical cyclones that have lashed the South Indian Ocean.

The vision, uploaded to YouTube this week, shows the Fugro Discovery being fiercely tossed by waves in the remote area of the southern Indian Ocean, where the missing plane is believed to be located.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre, who is leading the search, announced on Wednesday the search has been temporarily suspended due to the severe conditions, reports Business Insider.

The JACC has announced the vessels are unable to deploy or retrieve the AUV equipment under the severe conditions

'The effects of tropical cyclone Eunice and ex-tropical cyclone Diamondra resulted in search vessels leaving the search area on 1 February,' JACC said in the operational search update.

'Under these conditions the vessels are unable to deploy or retrieve the towfish or AUV equipment due to the safety risks to the crew as well as the risk of damage to the equipment in the rough weather.'

Waves of up to 12 meters were predicted in the search area.

An area of about 8,000 square miles, or about 35 percent of the search area, has been searched in the 11 months since the plane went missing.
