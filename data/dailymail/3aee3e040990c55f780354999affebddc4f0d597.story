Jessica Ritchie couldn't even stand up when she put on her roller skates for the first time.

But just three months after her first skating lesson, the determined 24-year-old from Mackay in Queensland was performing high-intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world with her real-life partner.

The former dancer met her Mexican boyfriend Jeronimo Garcia, 40, when they were both working as entertainment staff on a Norwegian cruise ship in 2010.

The pair had been dating for two years when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much. 

'We basically started to see each other and after that one thing led to another, but we had that lovely big ocean between us,' Jessica told Daily Mail Australia. 

While they were luckily based on the same cruise ship several times together, they repeatedly had to go their separate ways with different contracts. 

'He was in the cirque show and I was working for Nickelodeon - they were two completely different things.

Jessica had never even skated before when the couple decided to start their new routine - and three months later they were performing high intensity tricks on stage

'It started to become a lot trickier. I went to Mexico to see him because I hadn't seen him in six months and we decided we didn't like being apart.'

The couple were thinking of unique routines they could perform as a duo so they could tour together when Jeronimo suggested roller skating.

'I'd never skated before - he bought me knee pads, a helmet, wrist guards. He took me to the park and taught me. He knew how to stand on skates but I didn't,' she said.

'The first step was me trying to move on the skates, but then we progressed to spinning and aerials.

The couple, who met on the cruise ship, decided to create an act together when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much

It took three months for Jessica, 24, and Jeronimo, 40, to create a routine they could perform together and learnt new tricks by watching YouTube videos  

'When we were putting it together it was trial and error. We didn't have a trainer so we basically learnt from YouTube.'

Jessica and Jeronimo put their act together within three months and landed their first performance contract soon after.

The couple, who have been together for five years, now travel the world together performing as a roller duo and they are currently touring Australia with Le Noir - a circque show with a dark twist.

'It's been amazing getting to travel the world. We started over in Germany on the cruise ship, then we went to (places like) London. We've been to the US and China - this is our second tour in Australia.'

They have a strict cardio and endurance training regime they stick to - only having one day off a week to do nothing and eat what they like

While the couple spend their time travelling across the world, they do have a house together in Mexico where they spend most of their downtime

The couple have an intense and strict exercise regime to stay in shape for their aerial skating routine.

'This particular act is extreme cardio... I spend most time in the air,' Jessica said.

'We do a lot of cardio and endurance training to keep in shape. We give ourselves one day off to do nothing and eat what we want.

'Before shows we will practice the tricks or maybe work on a new trick.'

Le Noir - The Dark Side of Cirque is currently touring across Australia until April 18. 

Jessica and Jeronimo, who mostly spend their free time at their house in Mexico, practice their high intensity tricks everyday before a show

The couple have now been together for almost five years after first meeting on the cruise ship in 2010
