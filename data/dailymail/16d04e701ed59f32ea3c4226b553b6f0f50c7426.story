Already it has become the defining image 
of the title race: the slip, the desperate scramble to get upright and 
the despairing chase as Demba Ba closes in on goal to score for Chelsea.

It
 encapsulated everything that has made the Premier League a compelling 
global spectacle. There was genuine pathos in seeing a player of Steven 
Gerrard’s stature close to a title that no one had ever imagined him 
winning, only to see it fall away in the final games of the season, in 
part as a result of his own mistake.

It
 was almost irrelevant that title races are not decided in single 
moments, that a combination of events over nine months determines the 
outcome and that, in that Chelsea match, there was still time for  
Liverpool to recover. Such rationality is obscured by the power of a 
10-second video clip that seemingly changed Gerrard’s destiny.

Cruel: TV footage of Steven Gerrard's costly slip which gifted Chelsea the lead at Anfield

‘Yeah, it was unfair, of course it was, because of the timing with three games to go,’ said Gerrard last week, talking publicly about that Anfield moment for the first time. ‘We were top of the League. It’s cruel. But that’s football, that’s life. I can’t feel sorry for myself. It’s done.’

And for Gerrard the words have to be meaningful rather than a mantra he repeats to comfort himself. He is sat in the Vale de Lobo resort on the Algarve coast in Portugal, here on England duty, and he is the captain of a young, inexperienced squad who are about to travel to Brazil to play in the World Cup finals.

Football challenges do not come much greater and for Gerrard there is no time for introspection. Not that he is one to dwell on failures. He has managed to avoid viewing a repeat of his error. ‘I haven’t seen it. When you slip… is there anybody who hasn’t slipped at any time in their life? The difference is I did it at a bad time and at a bad place, at a bad moment.

‘If I’d done a bad backpass, scored an own goal, or done my job wrong it would have really beaten me up for a long time. I keep saying to myself, how, where and why? There are no answers because it was a slip. 

‘If I had made that mistake when I was younger — for example when I scored that own goal against Chelsea (in the 2005 League Cup final) when I was around 23. That killed me for a long time.’

He recalls: ‘You are not experienced enough to know that you can make up
 for it with time, that the memory will fade away. I put myself under an
 awful lot more pressure then. That’s not to say I won’t put the same 
pressure on myself to make up for this one, but I’ve learned to cope 
better with setbacks through age.

‘I don’t like making mistakes, big 
mistakes at important times. I’ve made more than a few through my career
 but as a player with experience you learn to deal with them that little
 bit better the older you get. Yes, it hurt a lot — not just the slip, 
more letting the title slip towards the end because we’d come so close 
and had a terrific season.

‘I was disappointed for all the lads, for 
all the supporters and everyone at the club, that we couldn’t hang on 
and do it. It would have been a monumental achievement to go from 
seventh to first. But with experience you tend to look back at the 
positives as well as the negatives. To finish second in the hardest 
League in the world, to have the season I’ve had personally, to watch 
the likes of Raheem Sterling grow and to see the team do so well, was 
fantastic.’

His response is unsurprising. The end of the season must 
have been a crushing disappointment but he is 34 next week and old 
enough to maintain perspective. He is married to Alex, has three young 
daughters and they are quick to focus his mind on other matters.

‘They
 don’t get involved with the football,’ said Gerrard. ‘Alex is  clueless
 when it comes to football and none of my girls are interested so I had 
to deal with it myself. I don’t want anyone around this table thinking 
I’m a young, naive, insecure person who goes home and cries in his 
bedroom.

'I’m 33 years of age with 100 or so caps and 600-odd 
appearances. I’m big enough and brave enough to take it on the chin. I 
take responsibility for the slip and the damage it’s done. But I’ll 
prove to everybody in this World Cup that I’m fit, fresh and ready to 
perform.’

Those reflections also reveal a trace of the thoughts of 
Steve Peters, the renowned psychiatrist with whom Gerrard works and who 
is accompanying the England squad to Brazil. Gerrard once would have 
been marked down as a worrier; certainly former England manager Fabio 
Capello thought so.

That does not seem to be the case today.

‘I’ve 
spoken to Steve Peters about it,’ said Gerrard. ‘I talk to him about the
 good things and bad things I do in every single game and every training
 session. It’s not just about the one case that I might dwell on for a 
long time. Having Steve there is a bit of a help in dealing with it.’

Clearly, with the World Cup upon us, there are more pressing matters, for which Gerrard is grateful.

‘Otherwise
 I would be sitting on a sun lounger wondering about to the last three 
or four games of the season, keeping going over and over where it’s gone
 wrong, asking myself why and where, driving myself potty. I’ve got to 
park the slip at the back of my mind and forget about it because I’ve 
got a huge tournament coming up.

‘Once you start playing and 
training, different things come up to think about. For example, Italy,  
Uruguay, Luis Suarez, Costa Rica. Those are the things on my mind.

‘I’ve
 got to make sure for everyone’s sake that I park the memory — I can’t 
change it. I’ve got to try to perform as well as I can for everyone.’

Indeed, the vibrancy and youth of this England squad may prove to be the best antidote to Gerrard’s disappointments.

‘There
 is lots of energy in the camp, thank God,’ added Gerrard, as he 
gestures to Sterling, 19, sitting nearby. ‘I haven’t told him yet but 
he’ll be doing all my running!

‘There are plenty of legs, plenty of 
energy, plenty of excitement in the squad but it’s also mixed with a  
couple of older, more experienced lads who have been around  the block, 
and they will support them and take all the pressure off them.

‘They’ve
 got no worrying to be doing or any pressure at all from us. We want 
them to go out with no fear, to do as much damage as they can. They’re 
certainly capable of it.

‘I’m excited to be here surrounded by a lot 
of young talent. Like me, I’m sure you’re all wondering how it’s going 
to go and can they produce the form they’ve produced with their clubs 
for England?

‘Time will tell and we’ll have to wait and see. But I’ve got confidence and belief in these youngsters.

‘They’ve
 shown for Liverpool in some really big games, against big opponents, 
that they have no fear and are capable of causing all sorts of problems.
 And I think that will be the case over in Brazil.’

For Gerrard, of 
course, it could be a last appearance on the world stage for his 
country. International retirement looms at the end of this tournament, 
although manager Roy Hodgson will undoubtedly attempt to talk him out of
 it.

Gerrard will make a decision at the end of the tournament. A 
good World Cup and the promise of youth might persuade him to play on.

Final glory: It could be Gerrard's last appearance on the world stage for England

With
 an eye to the future he adds: ‘I’m not going to leave anyone hanging. 
Don’t worry: as soon as the World Cup is over I’ll sit down with the 
manager and I’ll make the decision. I haven’t made that decision because
 I haven’t had the chance to chat with the manager at length over it.

‘But
 I’ll be chatting to (Liverpool manager) Brendan Rodgers, Roy Hodgson 
and a few important  people around me, whose opinion I respect, players 
I’ve played with.

‘I’ll chat to them all and make the right decision
 at the right time. It will be very close after the World Cup. It does 
depend on how the World Cup goes, how I perform, how the team perform. 
Am I still going to be wanted after the World Cup? These are all the 
questions we’ll have to sit down and answer.

‘I won’t stay around if
 I’m not wanted. I hope I perform to the level where I’m wanted and I’ve
 got that difficult decision to make.’

After all, next season Liverpool will play in the Champions League, an additional if welcome burden.

‘That
 will be a factor,’ says  Gerrard earnestly, before smiling. ‘But we 
have to wait and see whether I’m selected to play in those Champions 
League games.’

A new generation is knocking on the door, impatient to
 arrive. But England and Liverpool will want to call on Gerrard for a 
year or two yet.
