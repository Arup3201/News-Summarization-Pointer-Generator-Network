Nicolas Sarkozy has said left-wing judges are out to humiliate him after he was charged with corruption and influence peddling after 15 hours of questioning.

The 59-year-old became the first former French president to be taken into custody.

He was quizzed under police guard over allegations that he tried to use his influence to
 thwart an investigation of his 2007 election campaign.

Questioned: Sarkozy was quizzed under police guard over allegations that he tried to use his influence to thwart an investigation of his 2007 election campaign

Speaking today he said being taken into formal police custody, an unprecedented move against a former French leader, had been intended to humiliate him.

'There was an intention to humiliate me by summoning me in the form of a formal detention,' Sarkozy said in a televised interview, denouncing corruption-related charges laid against him as 'grotesque'.

He questioned the impartiality of one of the judges who charged him, Claire Thepaut, noting that she was a member of the left-wing SM judges' union.

'Is it normal to chose... a magistrate who belongs to the SM?,' he asked.

Sarkozy said he would declare 'at the end of August or beginning of September' whether he planned a return to politics by running for the leadership of the centre-right main opposition UMP party.

'There is no question of renouncing (politics) for me," he said, adding: 'When it comes to your country, you have duties.'

French prosecutors later announced that Sarkozy was 'mis en examen' - put under formal investigation in what amounts to being charged.

It means his case will be examined by a judge, who will determine if whether there is sufficient evidence for him
 to be charged.

News of the formal investigation is the 
latest blow to Sarkozy's hopes of a 2017 political comeback after his 2012 election 
defeat by Socialist rival Francois Hollande.

Sarkozy is being investigated on 
suspicion he used his influence to secure leaked details of an inquiry 
into alleged irregularities in his victorious 2007 election campaign. 

He
 is accused of influence peddling, corruption and benefiting from 'the 
breach of professional secrets,' the prosecutor's office said.

Influence-peddling can be punished by up to five years in prison and a fine of 500,000 euros (around £400,000).

Sarkozy was
 informed of the formal investigation during the early hours this morning by 
investigating magistrates after he had been held  in police custody until nearly midnight 
on Tuesday.

He
 arrived at police offices in the Paris suburb of Nanterre just after 
8am and was placed ‘garde a vue', a legal term meaning he is a suspect 
in a criminal inquiry.

Sarkozy's detention over accusations of influence-peddling at France's highest court followed the arrest on Monday of two magistrates and Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog. 

Mr Sarkozy arrived by car at the anti-corruption office in Paris this morning to be questioned by investigators into suspected 'influence-peddling'

The
 former leader is said to have offered one of the judges, Gilbert 
Azibert, a job in return for inside information on the so-called 
Bettencourt affair.

This
 was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of illegally accepting millions
 from Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest 
woman, for his election campaign in 2007. The case has now been dropped.
  

Officials
 also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone had been 
tapped by those investigating whether he received money from the late 
Colonel Gaddafi of Libya.

Sarkozy
 is said to have used a special mobile phone, registered under the name 
‘Paul Bismuth', to speak to his lawyer because he suspected he had been 
bugged. 

Soon
 after he stepped down as president in 2012, the Paris home he shares 
with his third wife, former model Carla Bruni, was raided by 
anti-corruption police. 

As president, he had enjoyed immunity from prosecution, but this came to an end with his defeat by Socialist candidate Francois Hollande. Sarkozy, who has indicated he will run for re-election in 2017, has always insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing.

But yesterday's developments are a disaster for his political ambitions as he faces being formally charged with influence-peddling, which carries a maximum prison sentence of a decade.

His remand in custody is unprecedented. Jacques Chirac, once Sarkozy's mentor and his predecessor as president, was found guilty of corruption in 2011. 

It had been alleged that Mr Sarkozy was helped in his winning 2007 election campaign with up to 50 million euros (£40million) provided by former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, pictured

But he was never held in custody and received only a two-year suspended sentence for embezzling public funds when he was mayor of Paris.

Conservative friends of Sarkozy leapt to his defence, with MP Christian Estrosi saying the judiciary ‘have never imposed such treatment on a former president, with such a surge of hate'.

Others suggested the arrest was politically motivated, with Left-wing officials trying to humiliate him. But there is no doubt Sarkozy's behaviour as president raised suspicions.

Within a few months of coming to office in 2007, he had invited Colonel Gaddafi on a state visit to Paris, on which he was honoured as a ‘Brother Leader'. Alleged evidence, including statements from leading Libyans, has suggested more than £25million was transferred from Gaddafi's account to Sarkozy's coffers.

Yet it was Sarkozy, with Prime Minister David Cameron, who in 2011 ordered the airborne assault on Gaddafi that eventually led to his overthrow.

In a separate case, relatives of those killed in a bombing in Pakistan in 2002 have filed a complaint against Sarkozy for allegedly violating a duty to secrecy during an official investigation.
