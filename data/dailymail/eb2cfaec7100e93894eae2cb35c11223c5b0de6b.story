With a supermodel daughter, it is natural to assume that Valerie Campbell would be as looks-obsessed as the modelling industry.

Yet when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast and underwent a mastectomy, Valerie, 61, decided against the reconstructive surgery that might have maintained her perfect figure.

'After what I’d been through, my looks weren’t important,’ says Valerie, who lives in Surrey. 'When you’re staring into the chasm between life and death, you put things into perspective and whether I was left with one arm, one eye or one breast, staying alive was what mattered.

'I didn’t have concerns about reconstructive surgery - that’s not why I turned it down - but it was unnecessary to me; my legs are more important to how I feel about my appearance than my breasts - and it wasn’t worth the risk, or physical trauma. Besides, I’m scared of needles.’

Eight years after Valerie’s diagnosis, she has no regrets - although friends and family are still surprised by it. 'Even now Naomi rings me up and says, “Mum, why don’t you have a reconstruction?”. I think my daughter worries that’s the reason I’m on my own, that maybe I’m scared of intimacy. But it couldn’t be further from the truth.

'I can live without my breast. It hasn’t changed my character or affected my body image. I still wear low-cut tops and swimming costumes - I use prosthetics. If I’m not bothered about what my chest looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me, he won’t care.’

Valerie is not alone in deciding against reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. Around 17,000 women a year have a mastectomy, but only a quarter have reconstructive surgery, according to the National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit of England and Wales published last year.

The majority of reconstructions are performed at the same time as surgery to remove the cancer. Women who wait often want time to accept their diagnosis and its impact on their self-image.

But most breast cancer patients never have a reconstruction. 'In specialist centres that offer reconstruction routinely and have access to highly trained surgeons, only about 40 to 50 per cent of women have one,’ says Fiona MacNeill, consultant breast surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, West London.

Ms MacNeill says that women often find their daughters are the ones encouraging them to have reconstructions. 'The daughters are usually transferring feelings about their own self-image - they’re sure they would choose one so think it must be right for their mother,’ says Ms MacNeill.

'Women have different relationships with their breasts throughout their lives. A lot of older women, particularly mothers, see their breasts as functional and now they’ve served their purpose are less affected by their loss, while younger women are more likely to have reconstructions.’

A reconstruction is major surgery and can take three months to recover from, which also puts women off, she adds. 'Their breasts are never going to look, feel or have the same sensation as before treatment. Some patients take pride in their scars and see them as a sign of winning a battle.’ Others may see their breasts as a threat that could potentially kill them, so are not concerned about losing them.

'If I’m not bothered about what my chest 
looks like, why should a man? If someone comes along who’s right for me,
he won’t care.’

'As long as they’re fully informed about options, women tend to make the best decisions for themselves,’ adds Ms MacNeill.

Therein lies a problem, as many women are not fully informed about their options, says Joe O’Donoghue, plastic surgeon and British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons member, who co-authored the audit. Lack of awareness of the options and access to specialist plastic surgeons play a significant role in the low rates of reconstructions.

The audit found more than a third of women surveyed said the risks and benefits of reconstruction were never discussed. Options include an implant-based reconstruction, or a tissue reconstruction that involves skin, fat and muscle grafting.

Reconstructive surgery is not risk-free - 35 five per cent of women who have implant reconstructions undergo a 'revision’ operation within five years due to problems, including capsular contracture (when tissue forms around the implant, causing hardness and pain) - or asymmetry.

'The surviving breast will naturally age, while the implant hasn’t,’ explains Mr O’Donoghue. This problem is avoided with a tissue reconstruction as the breast ages the same way as the other breast and changes size, but the surgery is longer, more complex, and leaves scars.

Valerie had an advanced invasive ductal carcinoma - cancer affecting the cells lining the milk ducts.

She had felt a lump while bathing and was soon referred to the Mayday Hospital in Croydon, Surrey. She was given a biopsy and then the shocking news that she had cancer, and it had spread to her lymph nodes.

'My younger sister, Yvonne, who came with me to get the diagnosis, was bawling her eyes out, but it felt like the doctor was talking to someone else. All I heard was “cancer” and “advanced”.’

Delivering the news to her children Pierre, then 21 and training to be an actor in New York, and Naomi, then 35, who was working in Europe, was emotional. 'Everyone cried but me - I was shell-shocked.’ But Valerie remained positive. 'I said to Naomi: “Wherever this has come from, it’s going right back,” and she said she knew I’d be fine.’

Naomi insisted Valerie got a second opinion from a specialist in the U.S. 'You don’t argue with Naomi,’ Valerie laughs.

Valerie, who by now had been referred to the Royal Marsden, immediately started chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, before doctors decided that Valerie should have a mastectomy.

Valerie was also seeing specialists at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Centre in the U.S. and she opted to have the surgery - removing her breast and affected lymph nodes - there.

'Naomi arranged an apartment for me near the Mayo Clinic while I recuperated.’ Valerie stayed there for three months while undergoing radiotherapy.

Back in the UK, Valerie started hormone therapy with the drug anastrozole, which stops the production of oestrogen and cuts the risk of breast cancer recurring. Valerie took anastrozole for seven years, but stopped because of the side-effects. 'It made me so puffy I couldn’t see my cheekbones, I was bloated, tired, moody, had pins and needles - you name it.’

Her regular check-ups ended after five years, and she now has the three-yearly mammograms that are offered by the NHS.

'I’ve been free of cancer so long I don’t think about it any more. Now I see and appreciate the detail in life, as if someone’s turned up the colour. I’ve found myself again and I want other women going through it to know that’s possible - with or without your breasts.’

'I can live without my breast,' says Valerie - and so can many others

This may be because it is major surgery, often taking 3 months to recover

And it's not risk-free: over a third who have it undergo 'revision' surgery
