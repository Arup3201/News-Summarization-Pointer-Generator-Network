Victoria Cross winner Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey has been told by top brass that he and his family face a kidnap threat from British-based Islamic terrorists.

The heroic soldier and his close relatives have duly stepped up their security. They made the changes following a review carried out before last week's announcement that he had won the top medal.

A Defence source revealed: 'His life will never be the same. For this reason we have to be very careful. The soldier and his family have embraced the changes.'

L/Cpl Leakey's actions as part of a joint UK/US mission to attack a Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan in August 2013 included saving the life of a US Marine wounded in a gun battle. 

He is also credited with displaying outstanding leadership after insurgents surrounded US troops and destroyed their communications. 

A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'Security arrangements are regularly reviewed to ensure the appropriate security of staff.'

L/Cpl Leakey comes from a distinguished military family. His cousin won a Victoria Cross in the Second World War and his father is a former RAF Wing Commander.

His uncle is Lieutenant General David Leakey, who is now Black Rod, the Queen's representative in Parliament.

The US Marine Corps confirmed last night that no process had started for L/Cpl Leakey to be decorated in the United States.

Mother of Victoria Cross hero tells of her tears when she heard of his award and says he told her: 'I'm fed up of reading about wars, I want to be in one’

Victoria Cross Joshua Leakey gave up his military history studies just weeks into the course as he was 'fed up of reading about wars' and wanted to 'be in them' instead, his mother said.

The para brought tears to his mother's eyes when he told her he had been given the British armed forces' highest military decoration.

Rosie Leakey said she always knew her eldest son was going to sign up, and she recalls the phone call in which he told her about the life-changing decision.

He was in his first term studying military history at the University of Kent, having spent years reading about the topic after a childhood of playing soldiers.

Mrs Leakey said: 'He always wanted to, but he was at uni studying war studies and he rang me after eight weeks of being at uni, and said "Mum, I'm fed up of reading about wars, I'm going to go and be in them", and that was it. End of conversation.'

The 1 Para man's father Mark said when his son told him about the VC award he was speechless.

'He just came straight to the point. He said "Dad, you need to know that I'm going to be awarded the Victoria Cross", and it was as simple as that. There was a sense of unreality about it. I felt I was in a bit of a dream.' 

Younger brother Ben, 24, who is doing an MA in terrorism, security and society, said he remembers playing soldiers with his sibling and 'running around in the woods all day' and Mrs Leakey recalls that 'sticks were always guns or swords'.

Ben said: 'That's all he's ever wanted to be is to be a soldier.'
