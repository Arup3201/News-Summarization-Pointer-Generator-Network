Rio Ferdinand returns to Manchester United for the first time on Sunday, complaining the club he served for 12 years never let him say goodbye before his move to QPR.

Ferdinand made 455 appearances and a huge contribution to United’s success under Sir Alex Ferguson. But executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward stunned the defender by choosing to tell him immediately after the last game of last season, in the away dressing room at Southampton, that he was not going to be offered a new contract. As a result, the 35-year-old former England captain left for Loftus Road in July.

‘I had great years at Old Trafford,’ Ferdinand told the BBC. ‘I never got to say goodbye when I left, which was unfortunate, so it will be a nice opportunity to say bye to a lot of people who supported me and helped me.’

Ferdinand’s feathers will be ruffled further by Louis van Gaal, who yesterday appeared to dismiss him as a has-been. Asked if Ferdinand would still be a valuable asset, United’s manager replied: ‘No. There is a time to stay and time to go and I think he decided to go. He was a great player and maybe he is still a great player, but there is always a time to go for a player in a club.’

This weekend the first extracts of Ferdinand’s autobiography will appear in a newspaper serialisation, with the centre half expected to give forthright views on John Terry, David Moyes and Roy Hodgson.

Terry was suspended for four matches and fined £220,000 in September 2012 for racially abusing Ferdinand’s brother, Anton, during a game between Chelsea and QPR the previous year. Terry apologised for the ‘language used in the game’ but to this day he has not apologised to Anton.

Rio is also expected to deliver his verdict on Moyes’s difficult 10-month spell as United manager last season and to talk about Hodgson, who chose Terry ahead of him for Euro 2012.

The decision to move to QPR, said Ferdinand, was motivated by the chance to finish with Harry Redknapp, the manager who launched his career.

‘London and Harry were the two main factors,’ he said. ‘He gave me an opportunity to start at West Ham and this is going to be the final chapter in my career, and to finish it with him was a huge pull.’

Ferdinand and Redknapp may have to contend with a United side featuring five players making their home debuts following their £150m spending spree.

And Van Gaal believes it will be easier deciding how to fit in all his new signings than managing the expectations of supporters.

In that same BBC interview, Ferdinand was asked for his view on the changes that have taken place since Van Gaal arrived.

‘Pre-season was really exciting for Manchester United,’ he said. ‘They looked really fit, really decisive and they looked like they had a good understanding of the system.

‘And it was almost like a complete reversal once the season started. I think they will get it right. I’ve got every confidence the manager will bring back the good times for Manchester United. It’s just a matter of how long.’ But Ferdinand was critical of what many perceive as United abandoning their long-held policy of nurturing their own talent, a shift epitomised by the sale of Danny Welbeck to Arsenal for £16million to make room for Radamel Falcao on wages reportedly approaching £300,000 a week.

‘The traditional Manchester United fans, the real followers of the club, took great pride and pleasure in the club producing home-grown players,’ said Ferdinand. ‘It seems there might be a change in the order.’

He said: ‘For a coach it is always easy because he decides what he sees. I observe and then decide. I don’t have any worries about that. What the fans are expecting and what I expect are different. The fans will expect a new start, of course, and with these kind of players a victory.

‘But I know as a coach that when you let go 14 players and buy six new ones, you have 20 different relationships in the dressing-room. The hierarchy has gone. Now we have to build up a new one and that always needs time.’

The vast sums spent this summer by United and other leading clubs have led Redknapp to call for a Premier League transfer spending cap.

‘To make it fair play we should be able to spend as much as Manchester United spent before we play them on Sunday,’ he said. ‘What is fair play? One team can spend £200m on their team and another eight or ten million. That’s not fair play. How is it a fair play league when we spend £26-£28m? Fair play would be everybody having a maximum of £30m or whatever to spend and having to bring some players out of the youth team.’ 

The full interview will be shown on Football Focus, Saturday 12.10pm on BBC One.
