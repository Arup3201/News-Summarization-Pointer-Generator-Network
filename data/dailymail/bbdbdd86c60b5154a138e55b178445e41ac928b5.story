A drunk couple who performed oral sex on each other at a busy rail and bus station while around 40 teenagers filmed them have been jailed for 10 weeks.

Jacqueline Holden, 37, and Sam Rowan, 22, had been drinking all day when they played up to the crowd of youngsters who captured the lewd act on their mobile phones at Barnsley Interchange.

Rowan even looked to the crowd for encouragement while Holden lay on the ground and he had oral sex with her.

The pair are said to have been horrified at their actions when they sobered up.

District Judge John Foster branded the pair's act 'disgusting' and sentenced the pair to a 10 week jail term to act as a deterrent to others.

Barnsley Magistrates’ Court heard how passers-by were shocked to see them carry out their raunchy act despite being moved on several times.

Chantel Lowery Green, prosecuting, said: 'Rowan was looking around and wanted the growing crowd to know what was going on. - they both played to the audience.

'Holden then lay on the floor and Rowan had oral sex with her.'

Holden initially denied any wrongdoing after her arrest and insisted that she would never have been bold enough to have sex in public.

Philip Howard, defending, said normally Holden would have called the police if she had seen another couple having oral sex in public.

The court were also told that Rowan suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome and has other problems that affect his social skills.

Sentencing the pair, District Judge John Foster said: 'You both engaged in open sexual contact outside and inside the interchange in front of a crowd you were encouraging.

'The interchange is probably the busiest place in the town and the description of your behaviour has been absolutely disgusting. This demands a deterrent.'

Holden and Rowan, both from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, admitted outraging public decency.
