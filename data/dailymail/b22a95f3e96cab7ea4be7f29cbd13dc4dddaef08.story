Fox News' Bill O'Reilly is facing new claims that he lied about reporting following JFK's assassination

Book publishers for Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly say they stand behind his work despite questions that have been raised about his reporting.

O'Reilly's series of books about the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ have sold millions of copies and been turned into successful movies for the National Geographic channel. 

The latest adaptation, Killing Jesus, is set to premiere on Palm Sunday.

The liberal watchdog Media Matters for America this week reported on a 2013 online post that questioned O'Reilly's claim that in 1977 he was outside the Florida home of George de Mohrenschildt, a friend of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, when he killed himself with a shotgun. 

De Mohrenschildt had been contacted by congressional investigators looking into the assassination.

O'Reilly's claim that he was there was in his book Killing Kennedy.

Henry Holt and Co. 'fully stand behind Bill O'Reilly and his best-seller Killing Kennedy, and we're very proud to count him as one of our most important authors,' spokesperson Pat Eisemann said.

Fox News issued a statement reiterating its 'staunch support' for O'Reilly and said it would not respond to the individual accusations.

Also this week, the publisher of O'Reilly's best-selling 'The O'Reilly Factor' defended the book, which refers to his disputed coverage of the Falklands War. 

The magazine Mother Jones said that O'Reilly claimed to be in a 'war zone' in Argentina when instead he was at a demonstration far from the front.

David Drake, senior vice president and deputy publisher for the Crown Publishing Group, said that Crown would 'continue to publish our author's book just as he wrote it.'

O'Reilly has faced questions on his books in the past. In 2011, one of the stores at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., where Lincoln was assassinated, declined to sell Killing Lincoln because of historical errors. 

Those included giving the wrong year the theater was destroyed by fire and referring to the Oval Office in the White House when it had not been built.

Media Matters posted another story Wednesday questioning an O'Reilly statement that he had witnessed the execution of four nuns during El Salvador's civil war in 1980, based on a 2012 statement that O'Reilly made that 'I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.'

O'Reilly said Wednesday, however, that he had been shown pictures of the aftermath of the shooting while he was in El Salvador. 

He said his 2012 statement, during a discussion of the nature of evil after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting massacre, was a reference to seeing those pictures, not the shooting itself.

O'Reilly was defended - sort of - by longtime nemesis Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' on Monday. Stewart has suggested the media should be spending more time looking at the actions of politicians than media figures like Brian Williams and O'Reilly.

Stewart noted the reporting on O'Reilly's past work at the same time his Fox show, 'The O'Reilly Factor,' is sending a staffer to look at all the snow in Boston and question global warming - reporting more worthy of scrutiny.

'Why don't we just agree that a certain amount of anecdotes from our media figures are seasoned with (expletive) and let's move on,' Stewart said. 

Bill O'Reilly lied about being at the home of a witness in the JFK assassination investigation when he committed suicide, according to new claims from veteran colleagues.

The Fox News host has reiterated in his own best-selling books and TV interviews that he 'heard' the fatal gunshot at the Florida home of George de Mohrenschildt in 1977 while he was a reporter for Dallas-based WFAA-TV.

Several of O'Reilly's esteemed former colleagues told Media Matters that he is lying - and a police report and government investigation also undermined the Fox star's version of events.

De Mohrenschildt was a friend of  shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald. 

He committed suicide shortly after giving testimony about his links to Oswald as part of a government investigation into President Kennedy's assassination.

On the day De Mohrenschildt was contacted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, he took his own life.

For unexplained reasons, O'Reilly wrote in his bestseller, Killing Kennedy, that 'as a reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt's daughter's home, he heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian ... that reporter's name is Bill O'Reilly'. 

Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and author, first wrote about O'Reilly's alleged lies on his website, JFKFacts.org in 2013.

Mr Morley has previously worked at The Washington Post and Salon and is a visiting professor at the University of California, Washington Center.

He told Media Matters that O'Reilly's claims about overhearing the gunshot in De Mohrenschildt's suicide just weren't true. 

His claims were backed up by Tracy Rowlett, a veteran journalist who covered the JFK assassination. Mr Rowlett is a former anchor and managing editor of Dallas-Fort Worth station, KTVT. 

He told Media Matters: 'Bill O'Reilly's a phony, there's no other way to put it. 

'He was not up on the porch when he heard the gunshots, he was in Dallas. He wasn't traveling at that time.' 

Another veteran journalist, Byron Harris, who has worked at Texas' WFAA for the past 40 years and  won two Peabody Awards for his investigative work, also told Media Matters that O'Reilly made up the story.

A 1977 Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office report into the suicide, which included many witness statements, did not include a statement from O'Reilly. 

A Fox News spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday afternoon: 'Bill O’Reilly has already addressed several claims leveled against him. This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters.

'Responding to the unproven accusation du jour has become an exercise in futility. FOX News maintains its staunch support of O’Reilly, who is no stranger to calculated onslaughts.' 

The latest allegations levied at O'Reilly, 65, came after his reporting during the Falklands War was called into question last week.

O'Reilly had claimed that he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the conflict between Britain and Argentina in 1982. 

CBS News on Monday released video from four stories it aired about the Falklands War in 1982, all part of a dispute involving O'Reilly and his subsequent statements about covering the war.

None of the stories mention O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a CBS crew member being hurt.

The television time travel was prompted by a Mother Jones article last week calling into question O'Reilly claims that he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the brief conflict between Britain and Argentina. 

Few reporters made it to the front of the war, some 1,000 miles from the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires.

O'Reilly has said that he covered an anti-government demonstration in Buenos Aires that turned violent and that a photographer he was working with was knocked to the ground and was bleeding. Describing the events two years ago, O'Reilly said he 'dragged off' the photographer from danger.

Former CBS News correspondent Eric Engberg, who was also covering the event, characterized O'Reilly's account as 'dishonest' and 'completely nutty' during a Huffington Post interview on Monday.

Engberg said none of the camera operators working the night in question remember any of their colleagues being injured. The camera person who was said to be hurt has not spoken publicly about the matter.

During one of the CBS reports, then-anchor Dan Rather said that several television crew members were knocked to the ground and that North American television crews were 'jostled'.

An Engberg report, also released by CBS Monday, said police fired guns with tear gas and plastic bullets. He said in the report it was not known how many people were hurt, but at least some were seriously injured.

An Associated Press account of the demonstration said that police officers charged a group of about 50 journalists, beating some and trampling others.

'Two news photographers were reported injured by rubber bullets fired by police,' said the June 16, 1982, account by AP writer Douglas Grant Mine.

O'Reilly, on his program Monday night, showed portions of the CBS video and said it proved the event was no 'walk in the park'. 

He interviewed Don Browne, a former NBC News Miami bureau chief who was in the Falklands, who also described the situation. No mention was made in O'Reilly's report on Monday about any CBS News personnel being hurt.

The Mother Jones piece was printed shortly after NBC News anchor Brian Williams was suspended for misrepresenting his experiences in the Iraq War.

O'Reilly, long the most popular prime-time figure in cable news, has called the piece a political hit job. 

Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has said he fully supports O'Reilly.

'I want to stop this now,' O'Reilly said. 'I hope we can stop it, I really do.'
