There were many times on Monday, during Eugenie Bouchard’s straight-sets victory over Alize Cornet when it was easy to forget she was playing in only her sixth Grand Slam main draw.

The world No 13, from Canada, is just 20 and won the Wimbledon girls’ title as recently as 2012, yet she is now just one win from reaching her third consecutive Grand Slam semi-final.

She dispatched Cornet, who knocked out Serena Williams in the third round, with the same charming efficiency as she treated  post-match questions about her family’s obsession with royalty.

Roar of delight: Eugenie Bouchard celebrates after beating Alize Cornet on Centre Court on Monday

Nothing seemed to faze her, but then Bouchard is named after  Princess Eugenie of York, so perhaps it was fitting she performed  so well under the Centre Court  roof in front of a Royal Box  boasting the Duke of Kent and the Countess of Wessex.

The ‘temple of tennis’, she called it, noting dryly that she ‘follows the roof on Twitter, so I hope he was proud of me’.

There was also sporting royalty looking on in the shape of Sir Alex Ferguson, although Bouchard — and particularly her mother, who called her twin daughters Eugenie and Beatrice and her son William — might have preferred the other ‘Fergie’, Sarah.

‘First off, I should say it’s a  parental interest in royalty,’ said Bouchard, smiling, ‘probably mostly my mother. She named us, so I wasn’t really aware of what was going on at that time. She’s kind of a closet royalist.

‘I can be a princess, though. I can be moody in the morning and my fitness trainer carries my tennis bag around.

‘But that’s so I don’t get tired because I want to save all my energy for the match. I can demand a few things once in a while but I do it with love.’

Fans favourtie: The Wimbledon crowd showed their support for Eugenie Bouchard on Monday

Bouchard may admit she is prone to the occasional princess-like moment, but the only thing  precious about her display yesterday was her talent.

She would obviously have  preferred to face Cornet over  Williams, but the Frenchwoman, ranked No 24 in the world, was still a testing, experienced opponent.

FA chairman Greg Dyke inexplicably appeared to snooze off towards the end, but  this was a close, high-quality encounter  with plenty of entertaining tennis.

Cornet was playing in her 34th Grand Slam and, at the age of 24, is a veteran  of two Olympic Games. She chased, harried, shrieked, played some exquisite drop shots and enjoyed success at the net as she tried to rush Bouchard, but the Canadian kept her cool and responded by moving up a gear when it mattered.

Her flat, hard groundstrokes were erratic at times, particularly on the forehand side or when trying to take the ball out of the air, but she rarely panicked and showed maturity far beyond her tender years.

Not this time: Cornet couldn't pull off another surprise win over Bouchard having beaten Williams previously

Not impressed? Sir Alex Ferguson appeared to be falling asleep during Bouchard's victory

Bouchard said she was a ‘bit of a nerd’, enjoyed maths at school and had Jim  Parsons, star of TV show The Big Bang Theory, watching from the players’ box. There is certainly a calculated, almost unemotional approach to her play.

Fans known as Genie’s Army have thrown cuddly toys on to court at previous Grand Slams but there is nothing soft about Bouchard’s on-court demeanour.

Her steely resilience means she has far more in common with her idol Maria Sharapova than just blonde hair and Hollywood looks.

A 20-minute delay with Cornet leading 3-2 on serve in the first set, Bouchard’s first experience under the Centre Court roof and a 4-1 deficit to overcome in the first-set tiebreak were simply obstacles for her to scale.

She had to come from behind in the second set, too, slipping 4-2 behind and then pushing an ill-advised forehand volley horribly wide to give Cornet a sniff of a second break at 30-30 in the  seventh game.

Plenty to ponder: Greg Dyke looked like he had a lot on his mind as he sat in the Royal Box at Wimbledon

Bouchard clung on, however, forcing Cornet to serve for the set at 5-4, and then pounced on a  second serve, breaking back at the second time of asking.

From then she did not look back, racing through the three remaining games in classy style to wrap up the match in 1hr 46min.

Bouchard said: ‘I believe in myself. Every match I play, I believe I can win. I’ve proved to myself I can play on the big stage and I’m proud of the way I handle it out there. I think I was able to step up on the important moments.

‘I’ve been in situations like that before, so I had full belief in myself that I wasn’t out of it.

‘This is what I’ve worked so hard for — to be in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon — but I don’t want to stop here.’

Bouchard next plays the winner of Sharapova vs Angelique Kerber, who could not start their match on Court One last night. If one of that pair reaches the semi-finals, they will have to play three games in as many days.
