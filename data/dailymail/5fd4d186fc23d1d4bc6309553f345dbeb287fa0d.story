If you're making a list and checking it twice, you might want to check a third time to make sure that the toys you're preparing to purchase this holiday season aren't dangerous.

World Against Toys Causing Harm, or W.A.T.C.H., has issued the '10 Worst Toys' list to remind parents and consumers of the potential hazards in some toys as the holiday shopping season gets underway. 

They include things such as a light-up bow whose arrows are advertised as flying up to 145 feet and the 'Catapencil' — a pencil with a miniature slingshot-style launcher on its end.

Both have been placed on an annual list of unsafe toys released by a Massachusetts-based consumer watchdog group.

Hammering the message home: James Swartz, director of World Against Toys Causing Harm Inc., holds up toy battle hammer at Children's Franciscan Hospital in Boston

Fired: This toy machine gun is on the list as one of the 10 most unsafe toys as the holiday season approaches

Rough ride: The seat of this small, four-wheeled cycle is approximately 8 inches off theground. Young children are encouraged to 'swerve & spin', 'try new tricks' and 'race aroundthe block….' Its low profile makes the toy potentially hazardous for outdoor use and the kid should be wearing a helmet

Organizers, who have been compiling the lists for over four decades, said the toys singled out this year are representative of some of the typical problems they come across, and aren't the only potentially dangerous products on the market. 

'It's not so much about the specific toys. It's about the hazards,' James Swartz, the group's director, said at a news conference at the Franciscan Hospital for Children.

Many toys, he said, continue to have the same hazardous designs, including small, detachable parts that infants can choke on; strings that can cause strangulation; dangerous projectiles; and misleading or confusing warning labels and instructions.

'There's no reason, after all these years, we should have toys like this,' Swartz said as the group displayed each of the ten toys. 'We shouldn't be finding these things for manufacturers. They should be designing them appropriately in the first place.'

'Bottle Rocket Party', which made the annual list of worst toys. 8-year-old children, or 'rocketeers', are advised by the manufacturer of this'party kit' that 'shooting off bottle rockets is a major event.' The package comes with yellowcaution tape, however required 'safety goggles' are not supplied

Blockage: This multi-colored instrument set is sold for babies as young as twelve-months-old. The manufacturer provides no warnings regarding the slender, rigid approximately 4½' long drumstick, which has the potential to be put in a childs' mouth and block their airway

Sling this! The message on the back of this combination pencil and slingshot 'Play Safe and Enjoy!!!' is ironic

Dr. Penny Norman, who developed ScienceWiz's 'Bottle Rocket Party,' was surprised the company's kit, which includes rocket tubes, stoppers and yellow 'caution tape' but not other necessary or recommended items, such as a bicycle pump or safety goggles, made the list.

She said the idea for the kits, which have been on the market since about 2005 and retail for around $15, came after doing homemade bottle rocket experiments with children at summer camps and after-school programs in the Berkeley, California, area.

'It's a time-honored event for children,' Norman said of launching the water or baking soda-and-vinegar-powered rockets. 'But it isn't about children being set loose to play with them on their own. It's absolutely about adults running a bottle rocket party event safely.'

Robert Pasin, Radio Flyer's 'Chief Wagon Officer' and a grandson of the founder, maintained that the company's four-wheeled 'Ziggle' cycle, which W.A.T.C.H. criticized because it's low to the ground, is safe.  'For more than 97 years Radio Flyer has been producing high-quality products for children. We test and research all of our products,' he said.

The Toy Industry Association said American toy safety standards 'remain the most protective in the world' and that the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the federal agency responsible for monitoring the safety of toys, 'consistently' ranks toys among the safest of 15 consumer product categories commonly found in the home.

Choking hazard: These dolls, marketed for oral-age children as young as 2-years-old, aretouted as the 'perfect friend for your little one.' Many of these toys, however, are sold with adecorative bow made of ribbon which can detach from the head of the baby doll, posing thepotential for choking if ingested

Endless list: 'Dangerous toys continue to abound in toy boxes and on store shelves. The alarming number of toy recalls and the lack of pre-market testing and regulations in the toy industry are evidence of the need for continued vigilance for the safety of children,' the group writes on its website. 

'As an industry that creates magical products for children, we hold ourselves to the highest possible standard of care,' the association said in a statement.

 'Like WATCH, members of the toy industry are intent on assuring that the toys consumers bring into their homes are safe for their families. Unlike WATCH, we maintain our priority focus on toy safety every day of the year.'

Joan Siff, W.A.T.C.H.'s president, noted that there have been at least 17 toy recalls representing over 4.8 million units of toys in the U.S. and Canada so far in 2014. 

She urged parents to be extra vigilant during the holiday season, when W.A.T.C.H. says more than 65 percent of toys are sold.

'Remember: Toys are an embellishment on life,' Siff said. 'They are not a necessity. If they can injure a child, they simply should not be sold.'

Hairy situation: This soft, colorful hedgehog is sold for infants. The toy has long, fiber-likehair that is not adequately rooted and is easily removable, presenting the potential for ingestionor aspiration injuries. This hazard is not referenced anywhere on the product or product tag

Dangerous: The 'Air Storm Firetek Bow' toy presents a risk for eye injuries

Not as cute as you think: Joan Siff, president of W.A.T.C.H.holds the 'Lil' Cutesies - Best Friends' toy which can present a risk for choking if the cloth bow is removed
