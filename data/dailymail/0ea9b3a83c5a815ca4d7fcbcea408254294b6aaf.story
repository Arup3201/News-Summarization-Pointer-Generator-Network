Her courage melted the heart of Princess Diana and helped inspire fellow paraplegic Superman actor Christopher Reeve to fight back from the depths of despair.

Now Gemma Quinn, who was paralysed from the neck down at the age of seven in a horrific car crash, again faces one of the biggest fights of her life after revealing she is virtually penniless.

She won a £3.9million compensation settlement in 2000, eight years after the family car, driven by her father, was hit by a lorry in North Wales, severing her spinal cord.

But the cost of round-the-clock medical care, mobility equipment and pioneering treatments has eaten into the payout.

Now Miss Quinn, 27, is preparing to 
seek legal advice after learning her local primary care trust should 
have been paying for her medical care for the past nine years.

She is relying on a ruling in 2002 
which said the NHS had to pay for the continuing long-term care of 
patients despite multi-million pound awards or settlements. Miss Quinn 
says she was not told of this change and continued to pay her 
£100,000-a-year care bill herself.

Although Liverpool NHS PCT is now 
paying for her 24-hour care she says she hopes to get back some of the 
money she paid since 2002.

Miss Quinn, who lives in Woolton, 
Liverpool, said: ‘It has been an utter nightmare because I have been 
funding my own care since 2000.

‘We have been in a really bad 
financial predicament, so much so that for the two years until March 
this year, I had virtually no care.’ At the time of her accident in 
1992, doctors said Gemma would never live an independent life but she 
was determined to prove them wrong. She learned to operate a word 
processor with her mouth and gained good GCSE and A-level results.

Not long after her accident Gemma 
wrote to late actor Reeve after learning he had broken his spine in the 
same place as her in a horseriding accident, urging him not to give up 
hope. Reeve said at the time: ‘This amazing young lady showed me an 
example of how to cope.’

She met the Princess of Wales, who had
heard about the letter, on an official visit to Liverpool in 1995. 
Later, at the age of 12, she took part in Princess Diana’s funeral 
procession. Miss Quinn campaigned for spinal research charities, raising
more than £100,000, and in 1996 won a Child of Courage award.

As well the cost of care, Miss Quinn 
says a failed business venture, ill-timed share investments and a home 
education means she is facing a mountain of debt.

She said: ‘People ask where all  the 
money has gone. But more than £1million went on care, more on 
specialist treatments and day-to-day living. I’ve got some property but
that is mortgaged and could be repossessed.

‘I didn’t know I could get help with 
the care costs and, despite being fully aware of my circumstances and 
previously providing care for me, the PCT never came forward to offer me
help.’ Miss Quinn said her financial situation had forced her to move 
back with her parents, Michael and Jacqueline, who have since split.

She is facing further medical problems
after developing a bladder stone requiring surgery which is complicated
by her paralysis.

The stone triggers a blood pressure 
condition called autonomic dysreflexia, which causes excruciating 
headaches and can prove fatal if left untreated. She is hoping to 
undergo surgery later this month after the operation was postponed.

A Liverpool NHS PCT spokesman last night said they needed to speak to Miss Quinn to assess her case regarding her care.

Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS 
Trust, where Miss Quinn is due to have her operation, said the surgery 
had been rescheduled to the next available date.
