Pressure: Motorists are being handed unjust and illegal parking tickets by traffic wardens battling to meet targets, according to an investigation

Motorists are being persecuted with unjust and illegal parking tickets issued by traffic wardens battling to meet targets and terrified of losing their jobs, according to an undercover investigation.

The report for BBC1’s Inside Out London features interviews with wardens in the boroughs of Ealing and Camden, some of whom admit fabricating ‘evidence’.

Dirty tactics include issuing tickets in a loading bay after five minutes instead of 20, making up records of discussions with motorists in pocket books and falsifying photographic evidence.

One unidentified warden said: ‘Supervisors have a definite expectation of the numbers required. The pressure to issue tickets makes the job demoralising and depressing.’

Wardens who missed targets claimed they were penalised by not being allocated overtime or having holiday leave refused.

Others said it had been implied that if numbers fell too sharply they could lose their jobs.

Both councils said the number of tickets being issued is falling. However, figures released by car insurance company LV have shown that motorists are being stung by almost 900,000 parking fines a month at a cost of £30million - a 4 per cent increase on the previous year.

And tickets issued on Sundays have increased by 13 per cent – with nearly 300,000 tickets issued on that day of the week in the first five months of 2013.

The AA have said some traffic wardens had even 'targeted church-goers and choristers'.

Today, it was revealed that a man had been hit with a £70 parking fine after pulling over for just seven seconds to drop off his elderly mother-in-law.

Ian Hardman, 58, fell foul of a council-run spy car in Bolton when he stopped in an empty taxi rank to let 82-year-old Audrey Harrison out.

He later received a letter from Bolton Council, giving him 28 days to pay the fine – which works out as £10 for every second of his good deed.

Local shopkeepers near the layby in 
Knowsley Street said the council's camera car, which films from inside a
 small Toyota IQ car and has been labelled a 'cash cow' by critics, has 
been located at the layby for weeks trying to catch out motorists.

However, a Bolton Council spokesman defended the spy vehicle, saying drivers who stopped in the layby were preventing taxis from parking and picking up a fare.
