A group of purported Apple engineers has lifted the veil on the company to reveal what makes it one of the most famously secretive enterprises in the United States.

Employees are told not to even speak to their wives about the projects they are working on. Black cloth shrouds cover new products when designers aren't working on them.

Corporate security teams are looking over each engineer's shoulder at every turn, and a unique system called - what else - 'iTrack' is used to monitor every prototype device. 

Secrets: The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs is credited with setting the tone for his company's culture of intense secrecy

Several former employees and their 
family members chimed in that 'fear' is what keeps leaks from coming out
- fear of immediate termination and massive lawsuits.

Current employees, though, reported that it was love of the products that kept employees from blabbing about the newest gadgets that Apple is releasing. Many said they believe Apple fans genuinely want to be surprised by new products.

The revelations come from the question-and-answer website Quora, which received two dozen responses when a user asked: 'How does Apple keep secrets so well.'

The forum began last summer when rumors were beginning to swirl about the not-yet-released iPhone 5.

Numerous users who claimed to be current or former Apple employees chimed in. Family members of Apple employees also added anecdotes about life at the company.

Perhaps the most jaw-dropping response came Kim Scheinberg, the wife of former Apple engineer John Kullmann.

Scheinberg told a story of how she happened to be in her husband's the office in 2001 when he revealed to his boss that he had developed a way for Apple's OS operating system to run on PCs with Intel processors.

New images: Videos emerged days before the iPhone 5 release last year of a prototype of the new phone. It is thought that product was leaked from a Chinese factory

At the time not even Mr Kullmann's supervisor knew what he was doing.

When he installed his version of the Apple operating system onto a Sony Vaio PC, his boss turned to Mr Kullmann and told him that his wife was to, 'forget everything I know, and he will not be allowed to speak to me about it again until it is publicly announced.

'I guess he had some kind of "Total Recall" memory wipe in mind,' Ms Scheinberg writes.

Apple's jump to PC compatibility and using Intel chips in Macintosh computers was one of the biggest  announcements in its history when it went public in 2005.

Another former engineer, Robert Bowdidge - who now works for Google - told a similar story when he was tapped to make Apple OS X run on PCs.

'I couldn't tell my wife anything; she knew I was working in a different building across the street and pulling very late nights, but she didn't know what I was doing,' he writes.

New Apple CEO Tim Cook has only strengthened the anti-leak policies put in place by his predecessor

'When I had to travel to Manchester UK... she asked to come along.  I had to say "no way"... My parents heard I was travelling to England, but didn't hear anything else; they suspected I was involved with something related to the U.S. Government...'

His own co-workers didn't know what he was working on.

'We were asked to just sort of disappear - the phrase I often use to describe it was "make people think you've picked up a drug habit and aren't coming in regularly."  I wasn't even allowed to tell my manager; all he knew is that I'd been borrowed for a secret project,' he writes.

A poster who claimed to be a current Apple employee described tight security at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California.

'All prototypes are laser marked with serial numbers and tracked by a central tracking system (called iTrack).  Physical security is also highly prioritized, with prototypes required to be locked up when not in use,' the engineer writes.

Locked down: Often times co-workers don't even know what other members of their group are working on, employees say

Brian Hoshi, a former Apple account executive, write that employees work under threat of being fired if they leak something.

'The secrecy is upheld throughout the organization knowing that there is a corporate security team pretty much looking over your shoulder at all times and where even minor violations are grounds for immediate termination,' he wrote.

Labs where new products are developed are guarded by cameras, locked doors with key-card access available only to the few developers working on the project, and secretaries trained to monitor anyone who enters or leaves the area, said one poster who claimed a family member used to work for Apple. 

Apple take security, even in their very secure areas, just one step farther with a dramatic flourish: 'In labs, every project is kept under black cloths, just in case someone gets into a section they weren't supposed to be in,' the Quora poster writes.

'Plus the labs are all sectioned off and you have to sign into your part of the lab.'
