A FedEx deliveryman who threw a package 20 feet on to a concrete porch has been fired after a home security camera caught him in the act.

Jackie Moon, from Charles County, Maryland, was shocked when her mobile phone received a snapshot from her security camera showing a package soaring through the air.

The image was taken after the delivery worker's throw triggered motion sensors on the cameras, and when Mrs Moon returned home she checked out the footage in its entirety.

On the job: A FedEx worker can be seen on security camera footage walking towards a Maryland home

Disregard: But rather than walking the rest of the way, the worker simply tosses the packages 20 feet

She was stunned to see that the careless worker apparently could not be bothered to walk the 20 feet to her front door to place the package down gently.

The footage shows the small package, which contained clothing for her twin daughters' 'American Girl' dolls, landing with a 'thump'. Luckily there was nothing inside that could have broken.

'There was nothing breakable in the package,' Jackie Moon told Fox 5. 'That wasn't my point. He had no idea what was in the package - it could have been something breakable.

'It was just the way that it was delivered to us, the carelessness that he took in delivering the package to our family.'Â 

Shock: The homeowner Jackie Moon said she was stunned when she watched the footage back

Delivery: The package contained clothes for her daughters' dolls - so luckily nothing inside broke

Scene: After the package was thrown at this home, the owner contacted FedEx - and the man has been fired

The Moons shared the still picture and video with friends and family and posted it online, causing it to go viral.

They also contacted FedEx to complain about the incident and the company reviewed the video.

A spokeswoman told Fox that managers at FedEx are 'shocked' as it is not the way they wish for their employees to deliver packages.

The worker has subsequently been fired, the spokeswoman said.
