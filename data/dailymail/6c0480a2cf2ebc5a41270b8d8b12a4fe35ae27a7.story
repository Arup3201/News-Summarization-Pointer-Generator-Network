In 2008, while earning $40,000 a year as a doorman at a luxury apartment building in Manhattan, Richie Randazzo became the Big Apple's most famous doorman when he won a $5million lottery jackpot, which turned the colorful Brooklynite into an immediate tabloid sensation.

But Randazzo been hit with a stroke of bad luck - it was revealed this week that he's been fighting lung cancer for the last six months.

Additionally, the millionaire - who was seen with a big cigar hanging out of his mouth at a press conference following his big win - has decided to forgo surgery.

'It’s the luck of the draw,' Randazzo, 49, told The New York Post from his home 
in Gravesend, Brooklyn. 'This time I crapped out, but that’s OK. I woke 
up the next day, and I’ve been waking up ever since.'

Randazzo's brush with celebrity began in 2008 when he won $5million on a Set for Life scratch-off lottery ticket.

Soon after winning the cash, Randazzo was spotted partying with Swedish model Sabina Johansson, who was charged with promoting prostitution shortly after they began dating when authorities raided Big Daddy Lou's Hot Lap Dance Club in April 2008 and found her working as the brothel's 'house mom.'

Randazzo - who was a homeless drug addict in the 1980s before attending rehab and landing his doorman job - even appeared on the Howard Stern Show at the peak of his 15 minutes.

Optimism: Randazzo is looking forward, despite his prognosis. 'When you're on a losing streak, you have to start winning,' he said

Despite the cash and being a pseudo-celebrity, Randazzo vowed to keep his $40,000 a year doorman job, but was fired when his frequent trips to Atlantic City impacted his job performance.

Since getting fired, Randazzo spends his time 'jaunting to West Virginia, Puerto Rico and Atlantic City, fishing in Sheepshead Bay 
and dining at Brooklyn spots Di Fara, Peter Luger’s and Spumoni Gardens.'

Randazzo gets about $12,000 a month after taxes from his lottery payouts, which he is taking in installments.

'No matter how much money you have, you can’t control your health,' he 
said. 'If you get sick, all the money in the world can’t help you.'

Three months ago, surgeons tried unsuccessfully to remove the tumor from his lung, and he's already completed a round of chemotherapy and radiation

Now, though, he's opting out of any additional surgeries, and says he plans to travel - and he's looking for a traveling companion after his girlfriend of 18 months dumped him after his cancer diagnosis.

'I’d love to find a good woman to travel with,' Randazzo said. 'I need 
somebody to show me how to work a computer. I need to catch up and get 
to the 21st century.'

Randazzo turns 30 in March and says he's on the lookout for a woman with both brains and beauty.

'Things are always going to change,' he said. 'When you’re on a losing streak, you have to start winning.'
