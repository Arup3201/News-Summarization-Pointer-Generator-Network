Rory McIlroy admits that his unwanted habit of turning in awful second-round scores has 'got into my head' ahead of The Open.

The Northern Irishman is searching for his third major title this week but arrives at Hoylake on the back of a disappointing Scottish Open, in which he began with a then course record 64 before seeing his victory hopes disappear after collapsing to a shocking 78 the next day.

It is the latest in a string of poor second-round scores which have scuppered his chances at high-profile tournaments and McIlroy admitted at a press conference on Tuesday morning that his Friday scoring is becoming a problem.

'I'd like to stop it this week,' said the 25-year-old Northern Irishman. 'It's got into my head and I've been going out on Friday trying to back up my score.

The biggest concern, however, could be that McIlroy seemed uncertain just how he was going to do so.

'I've
 got to go out and pretend it's a Thursday again,‘ he said, before 
adding: ‘I don't know. I've got to go out and play, play a few solid 
holes and get the round underway. Hopefully this week I can turn around 
that second round thing.'

The
 former US Open and US PGA champion added: 'I have been caught out by a 
bad stretch of holes at every tournament this year. I just need to 
eliminate that. It's easier to eliminate the bad stuff than find the 
good stuff.'

Preparation: McIlroy practices his putting at Hoylake ahead of The Open this week

Those second 
round woes have cost McIlroy either victory or a chance of contending 
for the top prize at the Masters, Wells Fargo Championship, The Players 
and the Memorial Tournament. But despite that bizarre Friday feeling, 
McIlroy insists he is in top form ahead of The Open and in the best 
position he has ever been to battle for the Claret Jug.

For
 a player who once shot a scarcely believable 61 at Royal Portrush - one
 of the toughest links of them all - McIlroy’s record in The Open is 
poor for a player of such immense talent. A third at St Andrews in 2010 
is his only top-10 in The Open, while he raged against the capricious 
nature of links golf after struggling at Royal St George’s a year later 
and missed the cut at Muirfield 12 months ago.

But
 McIlroy appeared to be in a positive frame of mind on Tuesday ahead of 
his latest attempt to master golf by the British seaside at Hoylake.

'I
 feel as prepared as I ever have coming in to the Open Championship,’ he
 said. ‘I had a good week in Aberdeen in preparation for The Open. I was
 a little disappointed with my finish. I had one not so good round. But 
my game is in good shape.

'My record in the Open isn't as good as I'd like. I want to do something about that this week.’

'The
 Open is special - it's the only major played outside the United States,
 it's on links, it has the oldest and richest history of all of them. It
 would be great to put my name on the Claret Jug one day. It would be 
the third leg of a career grand slam. Not many players have done that. I
 would love to get my name on the trophy.'
