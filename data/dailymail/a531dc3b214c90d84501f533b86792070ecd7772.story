A reckless garage worker caught driving a work Mercedes along a dual carriageway with his bonnet up so he could charge its battery has been suspended.

The unnamed motorist sped along at 50mph in Hampshire with almost no view of the road through the windscreen.

The video has gone viral and was seen by the boss of Winchester's Mercedes dealership who realised it was one of his vehicles, being driven by a member of his staff.

Footage showed the man had the bonnet up to allow for a battery booster pack to connect to the engine, leaving a tiny gap for him to look through.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Dim view: The driver sped along at 50mph with almost no view so he could charge his car battery

Dangerous: The vehicle was driven along a Hampshire dual carriageway as incredulous motorists watched in horror

Despite the restricted visibility, the driver carried on along the A31 near Cadnam leaving fellow road-users watching in bewilderment.

Jon Head, group operations director at Mercedes-Benz in Winchester, today confirmed that the driver of the Mercedes had been suspended.

He said: 'We were all shocked to see the footage which showed a member of my staff driving a car with the bonnet open.

'We investigated what happened straight away, and the person driving the car has been suspended from work whilst we look into the facts.

'Everyone who works at all of our sites is fully aware of the importance of working safely, either on the road or at a dealership.

'We have never seen anything like this before, and we will make sure that it won't happen again.' 

Crazy: This close up from the video shows just how little view the driver will have had

Turning off: After running along the main road the driver calmly pulled down a side road and out of sight

Jon Cuthill, 42, was a passenger in a passing car and took footage on his iPhone.

Mr
Cuthill, a BBC TV presenter, said: 'We had just left the M27 motorway 
and the guy was driving in the same direction as us but I can't believe 
he would have driven like that on a motorway.

'I couldn't believe what I was seeing so that was why I took my phone out and recorded it.

'It was crazy and beggars belief.

'The
guy was alone in the car and was wearing glasses but he didn't appear 
to be bent over to look through the gap in the bonnet, he was just sat 
up normally.

'Even when he saw that I was filming him he didn't slow down or stop, he just carried on regardless.'

It is unclear how far the driver intended to travel with the bonnet in the precarious position.

Paul Watters, head of roads policy at the AA, said he had never seen anything like it.

He said: 'It's a very bizarre and dangerous thing to do, it is completely mad.

'The driver was just asking to be stopped by police and not only that, I'm surprised no body was hurt.

'It defies all logic and no one in their right mind would do it, I've never seen anything like this before and thankfully incidents such as this are very rare.

'What you would normally do is put the battery pack on the passenger seat and use wires to attach it to the engine, with the bonnet closed.

'But this was something else, it was just pure laziness.'

Mr Cuthill has contacted the police and has sent them the short video footage of the offending light blue E-type Mercedes.

A spokesman for Hampshire police confirmed they were investigating the incident.
