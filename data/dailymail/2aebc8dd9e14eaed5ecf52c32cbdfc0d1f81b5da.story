It may seem like a terrifying weapon from the not-too-distant future but a German inventor says his new laser Gatling gun can only be used for popping balloons.

Patrick Priebe's fully-functional laser gun is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers.

Mr Priebe said although it is only strong
 enough to burst balloons, the 8.5 pound weapon is still not suitable to
 be used outside.

Earlier this year, Mr Priebe built a laser weapon, inspired by the Gatling gun. The gun (pictured) is made from aluminium and shoots rounds of 1.4-watt Class 4 blue lasers

The 8.5 pound weapon was invented by German Patrick Priebe who specialises in lasers

The inventor said, although it is only strong enough to pop balloons, it is still too dangerous to be used outside

He told CNET: 'It's too dangerous for outside use. So, no, it's strictly for display only.'

A demonstration of the weapon carrying 
out a 'balloon massacre' has been watched hundreds of thousands of times
 online this week alone.

The video shows the rapid fire weapon popping 26 balloons mounted on a wall.

The inventor is obviously fearful his designs will fall into the wrong hands as he states on his website: 'No plans, no schematics, no blueprints'.  

Eight AA batteries power the laser motor and the gun's turret is powered by four ball bearings controlled by a mechanism under the gun.

As the barrel spins, the lasers - powered by lithium-ion batteries - are shot out.

Gatling
 guns were invented by Richard Gatling in the 19th century and first 
used by the Union forces during the American Civil War.

They were a forerunner to the machine gun and allowed people to fire 200 rounds per minute.

Mr Priebe's futuristic version is not the first laser weapon he has invented.

He became an internet hit earlier this year when he created a fully-functional Iron Man Gauntlet, complete with lasers on the palm and forearm.

He has previously created laser gloves and a pulse laser gun, a laser revolver and even a flame glove.

The inventor says he builds designs as he goes along.

He told CNET: 'I had a rough idea of the design in my head. The rest, as always, was part by part, step by step.'

Mr Priebe famously created a DIY version of Iron Man's laser gauntlet
