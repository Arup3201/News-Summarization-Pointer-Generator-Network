Kim Rose, 57, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, was questioned over allegations of bribing voters but will face no further action

A Ukip candidate accused of bribing voters with sausage rolls will face no further action - but he could be arrested if he tries it again.

Kim Rose, 57, was alleged to have bribed voters in Southampton by putting on a spread at a party event, which included the pastry snacks and sandwiches.

Although he was never arrested or charged, Mr Rose was questioned by police over an alleged criminal offence of 'treating'.  

He has now criticised the 'absolutely ridiculous' police investigation - and says he believes the furore could help him win his seat. 

Mr Rose, who is standing in a key marginal seat in Southampton Itchen, said: 'The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls.

'They told me I have got to watch anything I do. So I'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I'm going to run a mile.'  

Mr Rose, a jeweller, was questioned at Romsey Police station, Hampshire. He poked fun at the accusations by taking in boxes of Jaffa Cakes for the officers.

It came after he laughed off the initial allegations by saying: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes.'

However, when he emerged 30 minutes later, he revealed that officers had refused to accept the treats, saying that would also constitute a bribe.  

Mr Rose, who had been backed by party leader Nigel Farage, maintained that there was no 'corrupt' intent behind his food giveaway.

He also accused rival parties of underhand tactics, adding: 'The support has been tremendous and it's backfired on the major parties in Southampton big time and I now believe I can win my seat.

'I could be the first politician to win a seat in parliament based on sausage rolls and Jaffa Cakes.

'This story went all over the world. I have friends in Costa Rica who saw me come up on their TV and they nearly fell off their stools.' 

The alleged incident took place at a community centre in the Weston area of the city on February 21 where his friend, veteran snooker star Jimmy White, 52, played pool with children.

The Ukip candidate put on a spread of sandwiches, sausage rolls and teas and coffees for the event. He said he was oblivious that he had done anything potentially illegal until he was contacted by Hampshire Constabulary's Economic Crime Unit. 

Although he was never arrested or charged, Mr Rose was questioned at Romsey Police Station (pictured) over the alleged crime - and took in a packet of Jaffa Cakes to poke fun at the investigation 

Mr Rose (pictured with Jimmy White, left, and Nigel Farage, right) branded police involvement as 'absolutely ridiculous', adding that voters in the marginal seat were unlikely to 'change their mind for a sausage roll'

At the time, he said: 'The sausage rolls were for the kids but now I have been reported to police who I believe have received a complaint from one of the main parties.

'Under parliamentary rules allegations of treating is bribing people with food and drink. I thought it was a joke at first and I said to the police officer it was a bit daft. 

'He said, "it isn't daft it could be a very serious offence". Fortunately I have eaten all the evidence.'

He added: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people aren't going to change their mind over voting for a sausage roll.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage weighed into the dispute, calling the investigation 'utter nonsense'. 

Mr Rose, pictured handing out sausage rolls in Southampton last week, was backed by party leader Nigel Farage. He maintained that there was no 'corrupt' intent behind his food giveaway 

 Technically Mr Rose could have been fined and jailed for one year if he was ever found guilty of 'treating'

He said: 'There seems all sorts of cases in politics of people behaving badly and doing things wrong, abusing their positions.

'Having a few sausage rolls I don’t really think counts as one of those.' 

Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by election candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes.

Technically Mr Rose could have been fined and jailed for one year if he was ever found guilty of 'treating'.

As set out in the Representation of the People Act (1983), any voter convicted of 'corruptly accepting or taking' any meat, drink, entertainment or provision could also be fined up to £5,000.

In a statement, Hampshire Police said: 'Following our meeting with Mr Rose yesterday on Monday April 13, we can confirm that no further action will be taken.'

Mr Rose is standing in the seat for the fourth time. It is a key Labour-held battleground in the run up to next month's election.

In 1997, Mr Rose stood in the general election as a candidate for the Socialist Labour Party which was launched by former mine workers leader Arthur Scargill.

In 2001 and 2005, the flamboyant businessman stood for UKIP in the Southampton Itchen seat, polling 1,623 votes in the second. 

The current Southampton Itchen MP is Labour's John Denham, who won by just 192 votes last time. He will stand down after the election on May 7.

The other candidates are Royston Smith (Conservative); Rowenna Davis (Labour); Eleanor Bell (Liberal Democrats); John Spottiswoode (Green Party) and Sue Atkins (TUSC).
