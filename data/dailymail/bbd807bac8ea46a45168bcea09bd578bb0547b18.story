Tarpaulin and tiles from the homes' roofs last night still lay embedded in branches of a tree on the opposite side of the road.

Rescue
 workers with sniffer dogs spent hours going through the wreckage after 
they were unable to reach two residents on their mobile phones.

Using
 a specialist cherry-picker crane and small cameras, the body of a man 
aged in his 40s and an unidentified woman were eventually recovered from
 the rubble that was left of the house’s first-floor.

 other people were injured and 25 people evacuated after the explosion 
on a main road close to Hounslow town centre, west London.

The area had been hit hard by the forceful storm winds with many sturdy fence panels ripped from the ground.

Road
 maintenance worker Joe Stringer, 23, helped pull two women out of the 
demolished houses when he heard the explosion at 7.33am.

top of a car outside the house. What it has done is pull the gas main 
up.

‘We carried on to our 
compound up the road and were just chatting when suddenly there was a 
huge explosion. We saw a huge cloud of smoke and that’s when we started 
running.

‘It was that loud 
we thought something like a plane had crashed. We ran up towards it. As 
we arrived, a few people started getting out of the houses. There was a 
gent there asking for help to get an old lady out.

‘She
 was just sitting there in the middle of the rubble with her dog on her 
lap. We managed to get her up and pass her over the rubble to another 
fellow.

 out. I asked the woman if there were any more people in the house and 
she said no and was saying about her dogs.’ Another neighbour, Ross 
Ellis, 40, a hospital manager said: ‘I thought it was a car bomb.

‘It
 was a huge bang. I looked out of my window and two old ladies were

zimmer frame next to her. It was a horrible scene.’

 relatives.’
