Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho berated the Stamford Bridge crowd in the wake of his side's narrow 2-1 victory over QPR, describing the match as 'like playing in an empty stadium'.

The Blues continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season after a second-half penalty from Eden Hazard secured the win, but Mourinho was critical of the crowd in the aftermath of the game.

'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans,' he told talkSPORT. 'At this moment it's difficult for us to play at home though, because playing here is like playing in an empty stadium.

'The team then starts playing like it's a quiet, soft game at home. It's difficult to get that strong start where the players, team and fans at Stamford Bridge [are all together].

'I was today looking around and it was empty, but not in terms of people because it was obviously full. That's what is frustrating.' 

Chelsea went 1-0 up in the first half through Oscar, but were given a scare when Charlie Austin equalised for the away side in the second half.

Mourinho also believes that the floodlights were not switched on as early as was necessary, leaving Stamford Bridge darker than it should have been until two minutes before Oscar's winning goal.

'I think the man responsible for the lights was in the same mood as the crowd, because everybody was sleeping,' Mourinho added. 

'He took 20 minutes to understand that it was dark, but I took 30 minutes to understand that the stadium was not empty.

'When we scored was when I realised, "woah, the stadium is full. Good."'
