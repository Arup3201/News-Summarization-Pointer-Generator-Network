After a few delays and almost 9 years after the last installment, Pikmin 3 charms its way onto the Wii U.

But is it a ‘must have’ Nintendo exclusive that will help shift more Wii U consoles? Whilst it’s a title well worth owning, as a potential ‘system seller’ it inadvertently highlights some key flaws with Nintendo and the Wii U.

The game sets the scene in a potential not-too-distant future Earth scenario; the world is overpopulated and all food sources have been depleted. Probing vessels are launched out into space to find a planet that could potentially house additional food sources that can be brought back to Earth.

Vibrant: there is no denying that Pikmin 3 is one of the Wii U's best-looking titles

Fortunately, one such planet was found and on their entry into its atmosphere, our three characters Alph, Brittney and Captain Charlie become separated.

The adventure begins here as the characters have to reunite themselves, find enough food sources to avoid hunger and feed the population back home and find a way to power their ship to get them back home.

Thankfully this new world is inhabited by very friendly Pikmin who are happy to help out. In Pikmin 3 players are encouraged to explore their surroundings and discover the best ways to navigate obstacles, whilst utilising the best way to use the various forms of Pikmin available.

Each different colour Pikmin has its own ability, red Pikmin withstand fire, black rock Pikmin shatter crystal obstacles, yellow can be thrown high and are immune to electricity, blue are resistant to water and winged Pikmin that can fly.

Each different Pikmin type allows for the game to be played in a number of different ways. Previous areas can be re-explored once new Pikmin types are encountered allowing for a good balance in strategy and exploratory gameplay. 

Players will have to decide which Pikmin to use for which obstacle whilst also attempting to split tasks between the three characters.

However, all exploring must be done in daylight hours with all Pikmin returning to their ‘Onion’ (their home), before dark lest the wild beasts catch them. Yet as each day passes more food is consumed by the characters so constant exploration to find food is key during daylight hours.

Pikmin are controlled using the Wii U gamepad, which is where one of problems lies. It simply isn’t ideal controlling a crosshair with the Wii U gamepad to whistle commands, throw Pikmin and navigate obstacles. The cursor movement just doesn’t quite lend itself to the game.

Charming: despite some control issues, there's plenty here to sink your teeth into

Use a standard Wiimote though and the game plays perfectly, yet as you can’t do this for off-TV play it’s an exercise in futility. 

The Wii U has often played on its innovation and the capabilities of the system and gamepad. It’s ironic for Nintendo that one of its most anticipated titles could have played better on its previous hardware.

That being said Pikmin 3 is still a very fun, charming experience with immersive strategy and exploration elements. There’s plenty to sink teeth into and packs a lot more of a punch than previous Wii U titles. It may not quite save the system, but it’s a worthy addition to the Wii U nonetheless.

Pikmin 3 is out now.
