For nine decades The Cenotaph has played an important part in remembering those British soldiers who have lost their lives in battle.

Every year a Remembrance Service is held at the central London monument to commemorate British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who died in the two World Wars and later conflicts

But to mark 100 years since the First World War, the names of every German soldier who died during the conflict could appear alongside the British dead.

The World Remembers project has been drawn up by Robert Thomson, a 65-year-old Canadian actor and director, and have been submitted to Andrew Murrison - David Cameron's special representative for centenary events. 

Thomson told The Sunday Times: 'A soldier said to me, "Once we are beneath ground, all men are equal. Only the men above ground create differences."' 

The plans, which have the backing of Canada, include projecting the names of the war dead including Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, onto a wall behind The Cenotaph starting from 2014, a century after the year they died.

The names of British servicemen and women would also be displayed for several minutes while overseas soldiers would be shown for 25 seconds each. 

It is believed the roll call would be made up of 9.5million names from all nations which took part in the Great War.

Families would be able to look up the names of their relatives on a website to find out when they would appear.

The roll call would begin a few weeks before Remembrance Sunday and would cost about £2.2m.

Heritage Lottery Fund is expected to receive a bid for for about £150,000 which would cover Britain's share of the cost. 

But Major-General Mungo Melvin, an adviser to the Ministry of Defence on centenary events, said the public may not support the idea of German soldiers being remembered at The Cenotaph.

He said: 'I would hope that by 2018 ... we would be able to understand we won the war but also that a lot of good German men sacrificed themselves for their own country.' 

A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, added: 'There are many innovative ideas around the WW1 commemorations, and we are aware of the Canadian initiative, which is attracting support both in Canada and elsewhere.  

'We are clear, however, that any project would need a partner organisation and sponsorship, if it were to be successful here.'
