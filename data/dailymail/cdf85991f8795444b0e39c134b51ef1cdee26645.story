Speaker John Bercow has clashed with Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers after barring Sinn Fein MPs from a party at the Commons to mark a century of Irish Home Rule.

He agreed to host a reception in his grace-and-favour Commons apartment next month to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Home Rule Act, which paved the way for Ireland’s independence from the UK.

But Mr Bercow later changed his mind after he realised that five Sinn Fein MPs – who refuse to take up their seats at Westminster because of their Republican beliefs – were included on the guest list.

The Speaker erupted with fury, saying there was ‘no way’ he would admit the MPs, who are close colleagues of Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams, given that they had failed ‘to respect the traditions of the Commons’.

His stance led to a row with both the Irish government and Miss Villiers, who urged Mr Bercow to reconsider for the sake of the fragile peace process.

Despite ‘intense lobbying’ by both the Irish ambassador Daniel Mulhall and Miss Villiers, the Speaker refused to change his mind.

In protest, organisers have moved the event to the Irish Embassy in London, where guests on July 1 will include Baroness Williams of Crosby.

The Sinn Fein MPs – Pat Doherty, Michelle Gildernew, Paul Maskey, Conor Murphy and Francie Molloy – do not attend the Commons and are not paid MPs’ salaries, although they do claim the costs of running offices.

One MP who is close to Mr Bercow said: ‘John was happy to hold the event as he has affection for the Irish people, but given their disrespectful stance there was no way the Sinn Fein MPs were going to be allowed to come. He said, “No way”.

‘The Irish Embassy was very pushy about it, demanding the event be held in Speaker’s House. And then Theresa Villiers waded in, saying it was important to maintain civil relations with both Dublin and Sinn Fein for the sake of the peace process. But John wasn’t having any of it.’

Last night, a Commons spokesman said: ‘Mr Bercow felt that since the Sinn Fein MPs do not respect the traditions of the Commons, it would not have been appropriate to allow them into Speaker’s House.

‘Previous Speakers have also held  the same view.’

A spokesman for Miss Villiers was not available for comment.
