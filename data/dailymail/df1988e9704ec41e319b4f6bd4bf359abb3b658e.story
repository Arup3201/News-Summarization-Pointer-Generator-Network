He is one of the most recognisable faces on the planet right now – not least in light of yesterday’s incident on the football pitch where he appeared to bite defender Giorgio Chiellini during his country’s crucial World Cup clash with Italy.

A pretty uncanny resemblance: Controversial toothsome Luis (left) and smiling flight attendant 'Luis' (right) 

But if the
 Uruguayan football authorities are looking for a way to defend their 
key striker after his latest controversial moment, they might be able to
 claim that Luis Suarez could not have put his teeth into the opposition
 – as he was thousands of miles away on a plane.

Specifically, he was on a Ryanair flight serving drinks to adoring football supporters.

That, at least, seems to be the evidence that has emerged from this amusing video. 

It
 shows a busy flight to an unspecified destination on the low-cost 
carrier, and what appears to be the millionaire footballer helping to 
serve drinks to passengers – to the joy of a group of fans of Suarez’s 
club team Liverpool, who serenade the ‘star’ with gusto.

It is, of course, an oddly convincing lookalike.

But should Uruguay become really desperate in their bid to keep their best player away from a lengthy ban that would certainly hinder their chances of winning the tournament, they could always use the video as ‘proof’ that the man who appeared to use his opponent as a chew toy in the Brazilian sunshine last night can only have been a doppelganger.
