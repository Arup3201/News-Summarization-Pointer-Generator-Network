With the season finale airing on Sunday night, The Bachelorette star Emily Maynard is already making arrangements to extend her 15 minutes of fame - with a move to Hollywood on the cards.

But in the meantime, Emily Maynard is pinned down to North Carolina.

The 26-year-old single mother stepped out in the city of Charlotte today and while she couldn’t enjoy the luxury of a meal in public with her beau, she instead joined a female friend for lunch.

The blonde bombshell was spotted going for lunch in an eye-catching purple maxi dress.

She carried a cream bag and donned huge sunglasses as she entered an eatery in the location where the eighth season of the reality show is being filmed.

The day before she was seen stopping at Charlotte Skins & Laser to get a facial treatment in between running errands.

This time donning a light tie-dye style floor-length dress and tying her long hair back.

Perhaps she was freshening up her face in preparation for her relocation to Los Angeles with her five-year-old daughter Josephine Riddick 'Ricki' Hendrick.

She has been excitedly talking about her initial plans when she arrives in California.

But while it might be a good idea to have some business meetings booked in, Emily is more concerned with beauty appointments to keep her looking like a star.

She tweeted: ‘My first stop when I get to LA is going to be @StriptWaxBarLA because my brows are a mess! @TheAmyBean put it on your calendar its a date.’

Recent reports suggest she is hoping to capitalise on the show's success by starring in a spin-off with her rumoured new love Jef Holm.

A source suggested she is hoping to continue her television career like fellow show alumni Trista and Ryan Sutter did.

The insider said: 'Emily wants to do a spin-off which would include the planning of the wedding. 

'She loves to be in front of the camera and there are multiple offers on the table for her to do other television shows.'

She has to wait to open discussions about her spin-off plans until the show's finale airs on Sunday however.

The source added: 'Emily can't formally have discussions yet because the finale hasn't aired.

'But she's really excited to get the date, location and all of the details set so that she can marry Jef and having it air on TV fits in perfectly with her plans.'

Happy couple: Emily is engaged to get married to Jef Holm apparently
