A California attorney has been convicted of manslaughter for striking and killing a cyclist in 2013 while under the influence of prescription drugs.

Hasti Fakhrai-Bayrooti, 41, of Rancho Santa Margarita pleaded guilty Tuesday to one felony count of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

Police say Fakhrai-Bayrooti was under the influence of Xanax and Suboxone when she veered into the bike lane between the intersection of El Toro Road and Los Alisos Boulevard striking 54-year-old Eric Billings on March 15.

Billings was sent over the hood and windshield of the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene, suffering multiple traumatic injuries, KTLA reports. 

Friend's of Billings, a father-of-four, told the Orange County Register that he owned a contracting company and mentored teens and young adults at a local college.

During an interview with Patch in July 2013, Fakhrai-Bayrooti expressed remorse over the incident and said that the ordeal had taken a toll on her, even leading to a suicide attempt. 

'I get out of bed with no purpose. I go to bed with no purpose,' Fakhrai-Bayrooti said during the interview. 

'I don’t know if I’ll get better, if I won’t get better. Sometimes I wish to God it was me and not [Billings].' 

Diagnosed: Fakhrai-Bayrooti said she has been diagnosed with manic depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

Fakhrai-Bayrooti said she has been diagnosed with manic depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

She told Patch that she takes medication for the illnesses and feared, then, that the presence of antidepressants in her blood would lead to a conviction.

Fakhrai-Bayrooti is free on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to be sentenced in May, the OCDA's Office says.

She faces a maximum sentence of four years in prison.
