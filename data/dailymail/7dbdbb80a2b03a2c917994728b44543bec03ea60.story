St Helens coach Nathan Brown has dropped a bombshell by announcing his decision to return to Australia, less than 24 hours after guiding the Saints to the Super League Grand Final.

Brown, who is coming to the end of his second season at Langtree Park, has been released from the final year of his contract for family reasons.

St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus said: 'Nathan received our blessing to apply for the Wests Tigers head coaching position and, although not successful, the same family reasons for a return home still pertained. We, therefore, willingly agreed to grant him an early release regardless.' 

St Helens coach Nathan Brown has stunned the club by resigning for family reasons 

The timing of the announcement is extraordinary, coming in the wake of St Helens' 30-12 win over Catalan Dragons that secured a first trip to Old Trafford since 2011.

Brown was absent from the post-match press conference, sending instead his assistant Keiron Cunningham, who is sure to be considered as his successor.

Saints say they will announce the appointment of a new head coach 'at an appropriate time during the close season'.

Brown will return to Australia and the decision comes just a day after St Helens reached the Super League Grand Final 

Brown, 41, who has a wife and four young children, enjoyed success in a three-and-a-half year stint at Huddersfield from 2008 before succeeding fellow Australian Royce Simmons at St Helens following a spell as caretaker-coach by then general manager Mike Rush in November 2012.

The former St George player and coach had been linked with virtually every vacancy that has arisen in the NRL and was interviewed by Wests Tigers before losing out to Jason Taylor.

McManus added: 'Nathan has done a great job in rebuilding the St Helens squad over the last two seasons and we are very strongly positioned indeed for the future.

'The club's focus is now entirely on winning the Grand Final at Old Trafford next week.

'We are confident and the team is looking forward to this game with absolute determination and focus. As it is Nathan's last game in charge, there is even more to play for and the motivation levels are even higher.'

St Helens say they will not be making any further statement at this time.
