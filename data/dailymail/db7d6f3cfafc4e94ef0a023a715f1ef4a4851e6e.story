A collector convicted of making bogus vintage wine in his California kitchen and selling it for millions of dollars was sentenced Thursday to a decade in prison.

The judge said he wanted to send a message to others who might tamper with what people eat and drink.

'The public at large needs to know our food and drinks are safe ... and not some potentially unsafe homemade witch's brew,' U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said as he announced the prison term for Rudy Kurniawan.

He also ordered him to forfeit $20 million and pay $28.4 million in restitution.

No vintage: Rudy Kurniawan, a 37-year-old Indonesian man who was ordered on July 24 to forfeit $20 million for selling millions of dollars of counterfeit bottles of wine to unsuspecting buyers has been sentenced to a decade in jail

Gone off: Kurniawan was found guilty in December 2013 of one count of mail fraud for counterfeiting wine and one count of wire fraud for defrauding a financing company out of a $3 million loan

 Rudy Kurniawan took the
 wine world by storm by claiming he had access to wines many thought had
 long since disappeared. Many experts gave his vintages glowing reviews.

But
 the Indonesian-born conman slipped up when he tried to sell fakes 
purportedly from France’s Domaine Ponsot at a New York auction.

When
 the FBI raided Kurniawan’s California home in March 2012, they 
discovered he created his fine vintages in his kitchen, attaching 
photocopied labels from top producers to bottles of cheap Napa Valley 
wines.

Kurniawan’s
 lawyer, Jerome Mooney, said his client is sorry for what he did but 
that the harm to wealthy collectors such as Koch was minor.

'Nobody
 was hurt by this, absolutely nobody was hurt by this. It's not that it’s less of a crime but that it’s less of an 
impact.'

Kurniawan, a 37-year-old Indonesian citizen of Chinese descent, lowered his head as the judge explained the sentence and described Kurniawan's quest as a 'bold, grandiose, unscrupulous but destined-to-fail con.'

Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula described Kurniawan as the 'kingpin of counterfeiters,' a man who turned his Arcadia home into a laboratory where he poured wine into what appeared to be vintage bottles before attaching elegant fake labels and selling them for tens of millions of dollars.

'He did it to line his own pockets,' Okula told Berman, who concluded that Kurniawan had caused losses close to $30 million, primarily to seven victims.

One of them was William Koch, a billionaire yachtsman, entrepreneur and wine investor.

Mr Koch revealed he splashed out about $5 
million on rare French wines which turned out to be fake.

Many of the counterfeits were produced by convicted fraudster Rudy Kurniawan who re-marked bottles of cheap wine with photocopied labels of top vintages.

'I just had to have them,' Koch, 74, said. 'Then I’d open it up and 
drink it and it was dish water or moose piss.'

Fake labels: When the FBI arrested Mr Kurniawan, his Californian home contained explicit evidence of the scam, including thousands of photocopied wine labels and used corks

Koch,
 an avid wine collector, admitted he bought about 500 bottles at up to 
$100,000 each, thinking they were from the finest French chateaus.

Although he said there would be little sympathy for a wealthy person who'd been conned, Koch choked up while describing the debasement of 'the art, craftsmanship' of fine wines being faked.

Koch, who lives in a waterfront mansion in Florida, is estimated to worth $4 billion from oil and other investments.

'I cannot stand to be cheated,'. 'I want someone to know they sell me a fake, 
man, I’m coming after them no matter how much it costs.'

Koch, whose twin brother is billionaire David Koch, has spent millions on lawyers and private detectives to expose the fakes.

Koch’s team worked with the FBI, and he agreed to testify against Kurniawan at his criminal fraud trial.

Lies: When police arrested Kurniawan in March last year, they found hundreds of home-made labels for vintage wine bottles

Before he was sentenced, Kurniawan twice apologized, saying 'I'm really sorry' and expressing a desire to take care of his mother, who lives in California after receiving asylum.

Kurniawan, who moved to the United States at age 16, had his own request for political asylum turned down, and he was ordered deported in 2001.

He continued to live in the United States after his appeal was rejected in 2003. He will be deported after he serves his sentence.

His lawyer, Jerome H. Mooney, asked for leniency, saying his client got swept up in the thrill of mixing with California's wealthiest people.

'He was insecure, very insecure,' Mooney said. 'He wanted to be them. He wanted to be part of it.'

Drinking games: Mr Kurniawan fooled several industry experts with his wine, despite blending vintages with cheap Napa Valley bottles

Mooney said Kurniawan used some of his family's fortune to buy $40 million of wine, eventually selling $36 million of it before he realized he could develop a business in which he created mixtures that tasted like the world's greatest wines.

He said Kurniawan's victims were wealthy and aware that counterfeit wines were a frequent occurrence in the marketplace.

'Nobody died. Nobody lost their savings. Nobody lost their job,' he said. The lawyer said the 2 1/2 years Kurniawan has served in prison was enough penalty, since he had lost everything and been branded a cheat.

Okula called the defense lawyer's comments 'quite shocking,' especially when he suggested that Kurniawan should get lenient treatment because he ripped off rich people rather than the poor.

'Fraud is fraud,' he said.

Containers of wax that were used as evidence in the trial of wine dealer Rudy Kurniawan are on display. Kurniawan was found guilty of masterminding a lucrative scheme to sell fake vintage wine in New York and London

Ink stamps used to mark corks that were used as evidence in the trial of wine dealer Rudy Kurniawan

Upon Mr Kurniawan’s arrest in March last year, explicit evidence of the scam was found in his home.

Thousands
 of photocopied wine labels for top vintages, including 1950 Pétrus and 
1947 Lafleur, Lafite, and Romanée-Conti were found next to hundreds of 
old and new corks, and an automatic device for inserting them.

Most
 notably, there were bottles of cheap Napa Valley wine labelled with 
names vintage Bordeaux wines alongside bottles soaking in the kitchen 
sink in preparation to be re-labelled.

Detailed
 instructions for fabricating labels for 1962 Domaine Ponsot Clos de la 
Roche were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages 
and chateaux names, such as 1899 and 1900 Latour.

Michael Egan, a wine 
expert hired by defrauded billionaire Bill Koch, told a New York court 
that 19,000 counterfeit labels of 27 of the world’s best wines had been 
found at Mr Kurniawan’s house.

‘There’s going to be a lot of wines to be cleaned up,’ Mr Egan told Los Angeles Times.

‘The
 whole thing about these great wines is that they’re meant to be 
historical artifacts. Every time you open one, it’s less of a dwindling 
supply.’

Before World War 
II, there are few records showing how many bottles of a particular wine 
were produced, in what formats, and in what packaging, with variation in
 bottles being common.

Also,
 the older and rarer the wine, the fewer people who have actually tasted
 it - and even skilled tasters can disagree about flavor.
