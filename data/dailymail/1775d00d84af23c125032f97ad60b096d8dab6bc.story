A senior judge last week used a sentencing speech to warn that the justice system is being ‘destroyed’ by cuts to barristers’ fees.

In a rare case of a member of the judiciary using court time to raise a political issue, Judge Andrew Woolman declared there would be miscarriages of justice as a result of the cuts as he jailed former Army corporal Peter Clarke for 16 years for firearms and drugs offences at Preston Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Woolman’s comments are among the strongest by a member of the judiciary on the Government’s latest drive to slash £220 million from the criminal legal aid budget.

Judge Woolman claimed all judges are worried about the ‘erosion’ of the criminal bar, which will make their own job ‘difficult if not impossible’.

Under the plans, criminal barristers will see their daily fees in standard cases cut by more than 10 per cent while those representing defendants in the most complex, long-running trials will lose 30 per cent.

Ministers have highlighted some ‘fat cat’ QCs who receive £500,000 a year in public money. But critics say the majority of criminal barristers earn less than school teachers and will be forced out of the profession by the shake-up.

Judge Woolman said: ‘People of ability are leaving or transferring to other fields of work, and new recruits are choosing either not to come to the bar at all, or not to the criminal bar at any rate.

‘Valuable skills are being lost, and will continue to be lost, and once lost cannot easily be regained. Last month, Britain’s top judge, Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger, criticised separate restrictions on cases that qualify for legal aid.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘At around £2 billion a year our legal aid system is one of the most expensive in the world, and we have no choice but to make savings.’
