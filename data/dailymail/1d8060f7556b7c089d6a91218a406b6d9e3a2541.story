An army forces charity has given murdered drummer Lee Rigby's family incredible garden makeovers that includes  brand new trampolines and playhouses for his young son to play on.

The transformations to both his mother's and widow's homes features pavers, shrubbery, flower garden, a beautifully constructed playhouse and a brand new trampoline for four-year-old Jack.

Charity Forces Support was the group behind the heartfelt gesture - their members, who are professional builders and landscapers, undertake free maintenance work for bereaved army family members across Britain.

The group undertook work on both Rigby's parents' home in Middleton a few months ago and then in the past few weeks, completed a renovation of his widow Rebecca's home.

Bill McCane, Forces Support chief executive, said he was approached by Mrs Rigby for a playhouse for Jack, but when he arrived he realised there was other work needed.

He said: 'We were approached by Rebecca. We have put out play areas for the children  - it's one of the things we do and Rebecca saw that and thought it would be a nice thing for Jack, and when I went and visited there were other bits and pieces that I thought needed doing.

'The playroom was a bit of a mess, it needed decorating. So with Jack's birthday coming up we thought we'd get it done in time for his birthday celebrations.'

The renovation team then spent three 12-hour days to get the job done as quick as possible, in time for Jack's fourth birthday on September 1.

'The guys said she was thrilled. It's the reaction on your children's face that usually makes the biggest impact, and I know Jack was running around between his room and his playhouse.

'For a lot of people, it takes a huge amount for a family to come forward and ask, and when you get out to a families home - we found this in Rebecca's case - she didn't want anything done for herself, she wanted the playhouse.

Forces Support recently received a heartfelt thank you note from Rebecca Rigby.

Although she made the first inquires about he possibility of having a playhouse made for her and Lee Rigby's son Jack, when Forces Support arrived they realised the home could do with a few extra fixes.

Eventually this ended with a makeover of their son's indoor playroom and fixes to a few damaged parts of the home itself.

Her note read: 'I honestly can not thank you and your team enough for what you've all done for us. The playroom is fantastic, and I'm sure Jack will spend many hours having fun in there.

'He's got a lovely playhouse in the garden now and an area he can enjoy outside.

'I don't feel like thank you is enough for what you've done, we now have a home we can enjoy and be proud of.'

'But the trampoline was set in boggy ground and the playroom walls were sort of damaged and I saw a few problems with the hall.

'People are quite shy of coming forward, so Rebecca had initially said: "We've seen your playhouses, Jack would love one of those, is it possible?"

'Families are usually consumed with grief and little bits and pieces around the home don't seem so relevant as they would on a normal day.'

Mr Rigby was on a London high street when he was attacked and butchered by crazed Islamic fanatics wielding cleavers and knives.

In broad daylight, the 25-year-old drummer was run over then hacked to death in front of horrified onlookers.

Pavers were also laid down to replace grass and bushes, helping reduce the garden's maintenance workload

His mother Lynn told ITV her garden had become too much work to manage during the turbulent events following his murder.

She said: 'It was my safety zone away from everybody, somewhere I could iust have a think, have a cry.

'But it just got too overgrown we never had time to get on top of it. I felt like my safety net was gone.'

The couple had been planning to renovate the back yard but this was put on hold when their son was killed and during the subsequent trial of Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

After: The team laid down pavers, removed the muddy grass and created a stunning flower bed for the family
