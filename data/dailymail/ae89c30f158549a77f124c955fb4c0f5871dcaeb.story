Tired but elated, Pippa Middleton was 
all smiles as she completed a cycling race across America after covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes last week.

The 30-year-old younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge was the only woman in a team of eight, which also included her brother James, 27, and it seems she's sparking a healthy new trend.

Ahead of the Tour de France, and following Pippa’s triumphant cycling challenge, a new group of cyclists getting on their bikes has been identified.

An inspiration: Pippa Middleton, who recently finished the Race Across America, has inspired a new breed of female cyclists

REAR’s, which stands for Regular Enthusiastic Amateur Racers, are 30-something women who cycle for pleasure but are still competitive with their friends and want to achieve fitness or personal goals.

This new category of women have been inspired to cycle this summer by events such as the Tour de France and celebrity influencers like Davina McCall, 46, Victoria Pendleton, 33, and Fearne Cotton, 32, who all love their bikes.

This is the first year since 1989 that women have been able to cycle Le Tour alongside men and one cycling company has pinpointed rocketing sales of bikes and accessories as a result.

Halfords has seen women’s bike sales experience double digit growth year on year.

A spokesperson for the store said: 'REAR’s are the latest cycling tribe we’ve identified, inspired by the likes of Pippa Middleton and Victoria Pendleton.

'With women riding alongside men in the Tour de France for the first time in 25 years, there’s no better time to get pedalling.'

Pippa Vopser, a spin instructor at Lomax, added: 'I have seen a dramatic rise in females attending my spin classes, it's now almost exclusively girls, so I created new techniques to cater for women's bottoms, arms and abs.

'I teach on moving RealRyder bikes, so I'm able to ensure a full-body workout. I am inundated with questions re toning, techniques and how to create the perfect body using the bikes - there seems no other workout right now that can do everything and which is fun, great music and is of course a cult hit thanks to SoulCycle.'
