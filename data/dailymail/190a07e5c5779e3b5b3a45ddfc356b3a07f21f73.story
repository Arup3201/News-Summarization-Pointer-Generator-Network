It is an all too familiar - and depressing - sight.

Festival-goers tramping through mud while cricket and tennis fans huddle together under a sea of umbrellas.

Sadly, however, this could well be the image of the summer. The experiences of thousands of sports and music fans today are predicted to be repeated at some of the summer's biggest outdoor events.

Following weeks of rain, the ground at many sites has been left wet, leading to concerns that a heavy shower could turn festival sites into a muddy mess.

As reported by The Observer, It has resulted in many organisers stockpiling emergency supplies in the hope that poor conditions do not ruin events.

Today, festival goers at the Isle of Wight Festival were again forced to bring out the wellies as parts of the site were transformed into fields of mud.

In Birmingham, heavy rain fell during India's ICC Champions Trophy cricket match against Pakistan, forcing play to be called off.

Tennis fans at the AEGON Classic also faced a delay in play following heavy showers.

Met Office forecaster Michael Lawrence said: 'Generally speaking it has been very unsettled today, very mixed conditions across the UK.

'There have been blustery winds, particularly in the north and on exposed coastlines as well as some thundery showers.

'For the most part this should die away into this evening. Tomorrow should be largely dry with the odd shower. However, rain will be coming down into the far south west in the morning.'

With major events like Glastonbury and Wimbledon approaching, many ticket holders and organisers face a nervous couple of weeks hoping the weather holds out.

A spokesman for the Glastonbury 
Festival, which starts on June 26, attracting 135,000 people, told The 
Observer that they were prepared.

The ground at the main stage is at the bottom of a valley which can result in water draining towards it.

Preparations: Many events are stockpiling emergency supplies in the hope that poor conditions do not ruin the experiences of visitors this summer

Slippy: The mud follows heavy rain in the last few days. But many festival lovers are carrying on regardless

Spokesman Jason Holmes said: 'The ground has a high clay content, so it turns into a very sticky liquid quite quickly, which also dries very quickly with a bit of sun and wind.'

Windswept revellers at the Isle of Wight Festival today enjoyed the third day of the event.

Fans were treated to a greatest hits set by The Stone Roses who headlined last night.

However, the late night parties were dampened by rain which lasted most of the night.

Tonight's headline act is The Killers while other acts performing
include Paul Weller, Emeli Sande, Jake Bugg, Everything Everything, 
Blondie, Imagine Dragons, Ellie Goulding, Rizzle Kicks and Republica.
