Watchdogs have flagged up concerns over the creation of a British pork pie monopoly.

The Competition & Markets Authority has sounded the alarm over the purchase of the savoury pastries business owed by Kerry Foods by the rival manufacturer Pork Farms.

The official watchdog is concerned the deal will concentrate the manufacture of pork pies, sausage rolls, pasties, scotch eggs and some other savoury pastries in too few hands.

The pork pie is the ultimate everyman food and can trace its origins back to medieval times

Watchdogs have flagged up concerns over the decision by Pork Farms to buy the chilled savoury pastries business of rival manufacturer Kerry Foods 

As a result, it warns this could lead to higher prices for the traditional pork pie, pies and sausages and a reduction in choice.

The pork pie is the ultimate everyman food and can trace its origins back to medieval times.

They were originally seen as a handy and transportable lunch that were popular with the lower class, particularly agricultural workers and grooms.

 

Today, the Melton Mowbray pork pie is the most famous of the lineage and it has even been granted special status by the EU, which means production is restricted to a small area of Leicestershire.

The decision by Pork Farms to purchase the chilled savoury pastries business of Kerry Foods has created a pork pie giant, which manufacturers the product both under its own brands and for the big supermarkets.

Pork Farms, which was established in 1931 and is based in Nottingham, claims to be the nation’s favourite brand of pork pie selling over 20 million a year.

It also sells millions more under the Bowyers brand, which also sells Scotch eggs and sausage rolls.

Pork Farms said it was ‘disappointed’ with the CMA’s decision to order a further review of the deal

The company bought the savoury pastries business of Kerry Foods, which includes factories at Poole, Dorset, and Spalding in Lincolnshire, in August for an undisclosed sum.

This allowed the company to make pork pies and other savoury pastry brands under the Wall’s and Millers brands, under licence from Kerry Foods.

The new company will be a dominant force in a market for pork pies, sausage rolls and other savoury products that is estimated to be worth around £1billion a year. 

Pork Farms said it was ‘disappointed’ with the CMA’s decision to order a further review of the deal.
