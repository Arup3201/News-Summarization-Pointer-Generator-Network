As the liveried helicopter touches down in the Palace grounds, highly trained professionals act swiftly but discreetly to unload its precious Royal cargo .  .  . Prince Charles’s favourite embroidered silk cushion.

It took two unofficial Protectors Of The Privy Bottom to attend to the VIP – Very Important Pillow – when the Prince’s maroon twin-engine Sikorsky landed in Kensington Palace last week.

After the 64-year-old walked to his waiting car, one of his Scotland Yard bodyguards could be seen bringing up the rear with the red and gold cushion.

Then came the handover.  Subtle, but in keeping with soft-furnishing protocol, the cushion was passed to the Prince’s leather-gloved chauffeur, whose job was to plump it up and lay it out.

The Prince waited patiently, glancing over his papers, until the cushion was correctly positioned. Then he lowered himself gingerly on to the back seat.

The events were witnessed by a crowd 
of Royal-watchers, as well as the Prince’s own staff, some of whom could
barely hide their amusement.

Cushy: Charles's chauffeur finishes the task

Charles – who famously has a trusted aide squeeze toothpaste on to his brush – uses the cushion to ease his back pain, which makes it difficult for him to sit for more than an hour.

The photographs also reveal the Prince’s reading habits, as inside the helicopter’s door panel can be seen a selection of magazines: The Economist, The Spectator and a copy of Autocar reviewing the new Ford Fiesta.

Another compartment contains a restaurant guide from society magazine Tatler.
