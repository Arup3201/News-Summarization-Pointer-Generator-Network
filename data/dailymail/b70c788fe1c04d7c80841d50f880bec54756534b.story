Demand is once again outweighing supply at Apple, with the company reporting more than four million pre-orders of its new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 24 hours, exceeding its initial pre-order supply.

The number of orders, which doubled the 2012 record set by the iPhone 5 when it sold two million models in its first 24 hours, even caused the Apple site to crash last week.

If they build it, consumers will buy.

Winning: Apple sold four million iPhone 6 models in just 24 hours

Customers who pre-ordered can expect to receive their new phone as early as Friday, though some will have to wait until October to finally get their hands on the latest Apple model. 

The phones, which start at $199, will also be available on a walk-in basis beginning Friday at Apple retail stores, as well as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless and other authorized Apple resellers.

Unveiled last Wednesday, the latest addition to the Apple family is not wildly different than its predecessor, the aforementioned iPhone 5, though the new model is slimmer, has a larger screen made of 'ion strengthened glass,' and has a slightly longer battery life.

For additional money, users can also get more memory on their phone.

The biggest change however is the introduction of Apple Pay, which allows owners to use their iPhone 6 to pay in stores and within apps in an easy, secure, and private way. 

The Financial Times reported today that this system is expected to make the already ridiculously rich company even richer, with two people familiar with the non-public terms of agreement claiming Apple will make 15 cents off of every $100 purchase.

Early Apple Pay partners include the 11 biggest US card issuers, representing 83 percent of the market, and retailers such as McDonald's and Walgreen.
