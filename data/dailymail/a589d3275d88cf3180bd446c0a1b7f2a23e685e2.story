Bolton chairman Phil Gartside has flown out to Thailand amid reports that Thai businessmen want to buy the Sky Bet Championship club.

Talk of a takeover at Wanderers first emanated from Asia last week when Brian Marcar, managing director of media company BEC-Tero, publicly expressed an interest in the team currently residing in the second tier's bottom three.

Gartside had originally cooled such speculation by telling the Bolton News that Marcar's quotes came as a 'complete surprise' to him.

However, speaking at a press conference on Monday morning, Wanderers manager Neil Lennon confirmed Gartside had now gone to Thailand for further discussions.

'I don't know about selling it but I know he's away in Thailand to discuss a proposition from some Thai businessmen,' Lennon said.

'What that is, I've no idea. What the ins and outs of it are, I don't know. I'll know more when Phil comes back.'

Things have not being going well at the Reebok Stadium with the club's debt reaching £163.8million

Bolton's debt, which reached a staggering £163.8million when the most recent accounts were published in December, has been well-documented, yet Marcar insists such figures would not stand in his way, with the majority of that deficit owed to owner Eddie Davies.

BEC-Tero already own a Thai Premier League side which has former Chelsea and West Ham manager Avram Grant as its technical director, a position formerly held by ex-England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson.

'As for the bid to take over Bolton, I must admit I have a close relationship with the club's president,' Marcar told Thailand's The Nation newspaper last week.

'The club has plenty of property, and most importantly, they have their own stadium, hotel and football academy.

'In terms of their financial status, they made profits between 2004 and 2006, but suffered losses since then, with their debt now standing at 150 million pounds.

'However, the club is willing to address this situation. They're quite ready in almost every aspect. That will help us benefit in many ways, especially when it comes to Thai players playing in England.'

Earlier this month, Gartside had confirmed he would entertain prospective buyers.

'If you want to go and put a for sale sign outside, do it,' he said in an interview with the Bolton News.

'Every club is for sale. If someone knocks on the door and says they want to buy the club, we'd listen.

'It's not for want of putting that message out that we haven't changed ownership. But you have guard against who you sell it to.

'Hopefully, Eddie is not going to sell it to just anybody. It's the same with me; anyone who walks through the door will get an audience, but having done that it's about due diligence that they do on the football club and that is done on them.

'Eddie would want to sell it to someone who is responsible, who has belief in it. He would want to know it's not a property strip.'
