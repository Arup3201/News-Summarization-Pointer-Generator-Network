French police were last night accused of jeopardising the investigation by rushing forensic searches at the murder scene.

Vital evidence may have been missed as a result of a ‘hasty’ hunt for clues at the secluded spot, British experts said.

They expressed astonishment that French detectives allowed the media and public to trample over the crime scene on Friday, less than 48 hours after the shootings.

On Saturday, three days after the killings, members of the public were free to drive up to the unguarded murder scene, and park on the very spot where Saad Al-Hilli, his wife and his mother-in-law were shot. Blood and glass, possibly linked to the atrocity, had still not been cleared up.

Bushes and vegetation next to the crime scene, where the killer may have hidden before the executions, did not appear to have been checked for any evidence.

The revelations will increase pressure on the French police, who have already faced questions over how Mr Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter Zeena lay undiscovered under her mother’s corpse in the family’s BMW for eight hours.

Critics also questioned why:

Police have not made specific public appeals for information about possible suspects.

Scotland Yard murder squad veteran Ian Horrocks, a Home Office accredited crime scene manager, said: ‘I haven’t visited the crime scene, so I am loath to criticise anyone, however it does seem from the pictures and video that the examination of the scene has been hasty.

House-to-house inquiries are incomplete and roadblocks are not in place to ask drivers if they saw anything suspicious on Wednesday afternoon

‘If this was in the UK the whole 
parking area would have been sealed off, and for several days. A 
substantial part of the adjacent woodland should also be sealed off.

Victim: Saad Al-Hilli as well as his wife and his mother-in-law were shot

‘The area should be protected from any 
contamination.

'Anything could be there, cigarette butts, fibres, hairs, 
any number of potential items that could either assist in identifying 
suspects or show they have been there.

'I do not know if this has been done, but journalists and the public should not be able to walk around there.

‘I have seen on TV that both blood and glass remains at the scene. This should all have been taken. Whose blood is it, what car does the glass come from?

'It cannot be assumed the blood is all the victims’, and the glass from their car.’

Ex-Met Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley said 100 officers would be working on an equivalent murder inquiry in Britain.

He added: ‘It is unclear whether the killers followed Mr Al-Hilli’s car or were lying in wait, possibly in the bushes.

'For that reason, I am concerned that vegetation nearby has not been removed and tested for DNA, hair and blood samples.’

The British cyclist who discovered the massacre has told police he saw a green 4x4 and a motorbike in the area.

Police said 25 bullets were fired in the attack and sources have said initial ballistic tests point to a single weapon being used.

French public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said police had been at the scene yesterday and had widened the area of investigation.
