It's an annual tradition dating back decades - but this year the White House holiday tour will have a distinctly modern feel, thanks to new, digital décor.

As well as the usual gingerbread White House, dozens of trees and many beautiful wreaths, the White House will boast infra-red motion sensors, crowd-sourced lighting patterns and matching robot versions of the first family's two dogs, Bo and Sunny.

Keeping with this traditional with a twist theme, the Obamas have also released their first ever interactive White House holiday card.

According to the Washington Post, a group of technology experts based at the White House made a 'robot skeleton' of Bo Obama made of chicken-wire which can swivel its head back and forth.

Meanwhile, rather than rotating its head at a set rate Sunny-bot has eyes with infra-red motion sensors that make it turn in the direction of anyone approaching it.

Both robot dogs have been made using basic software and hardware - Sunny-bot even has rubber bands as ligaments to give her head flexibility.

The two teams worked in their spare time to create the robotic first dogs.

The experts even watched videos of Portuguese water dogs barking to decide if they should give the robot dogs a voice - but decided against it as the barking was so loud they worried it may scare small children.

The experts then wrapped roughly a mile of black polyester satin ribbon around the wire frames of the robots to make it look like the Sunny and Bo's fur.

And in the festive spirit of sharing and encouraging youngsters into technology, the  teams made the codes used on the robot dogs open-source to encourage students to experiment and 'out-Bo Bo.'

According to the Washington Post, next year the experts want to build robots with animated joints that can move their paws and even jump.

This year's modern with a twist White House decorations also features an interactive digital snowscape that captures the movements of visitors in front of it.

The exhibition is a combination of traditional and digital elements and uses 3-D cameras and a projector paired with a hand made woodland scene.

In their first-ever interactive White House Holiday card, the President and First Lady wish Americans a happy and healthy holiday season and New Year. 

Meanwhile, this year's official White House Christmas tree, which stands 18 feet tall in the Blue Room, honours the service of troops, veterans, and military families.

The Christmas tree arrived at the White House from Crystal Springs Tree Farm in Leighton, Pennsylvania, and is trimmed with ornaments decorated by military children living on U.S. military bases all over the world.

This year's official White House holiday theme will be announced  on December 3.
