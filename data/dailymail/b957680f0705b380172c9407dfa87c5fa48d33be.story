A Halloween-loving New Jersey family has their Bellmawr neighborhood more creeped out than spooked with a front yard holiday display of bloody babies hanging from nooses.

They also just happened to be named Krueger. But these festive pranksters aren't after your children's souls, they're just looking to spread the Halloween joy.

Even the fact that the three young Krueger children spent hours on the unsettling creation isn't enough to convince some unimpressed  residents the display is all in good fun.

Creepy: The Halloween loving Krueger family has their New Jersey neighborhood creeped out by this decoration featuring bloody babies dangling from nooses

'I like to see witches, you know goblins and ghosts, not hanging babies,' creeped out neighbor Toni Flaherty told Fox 29 Philly. 'It's not scary, It's gross. It's disgusting. It's horrible.'

The kids of the family couldn't disagree more.

'It's hilarious and funny and scary all in one,' Lily Krueger, 10.

Her 8-year-old brother Greg agreed, as does their father, Chris Krueger.

Kids these days: Lily and Greg Krueger (ages 10 and 8 respectively) spent hours on the bloody baby decor, only to have neighbors label it an eyesore

Hanging tough: The kids say they built the display all in good fun and can't understand what's so controversial about it

'This is what scary is today. I don't think people realize that. This is what the kids are into,' sad Mr. Krueger, who appeared shocked that neighbors would be so concerned about the decorations.

Their family, he said, has always loved the October holiday. They were the first on the block to put up decorations.

But they don't intend to be the first to back down.

Krueger says he has no plans to take down his kids' Halloween creation.

The kids' dad Chris Krueger says the family has absolutely no plans to take down their doll gallows display

True to their name: The Kruegers were the first in the neighborhood to decorate for the season (pictured), but they don't intend to be the first to back down in this face-off with neighbors
