It's a gripe often levelled at Britain's frosty talent show judges: why don't you get up and do this yourselves?

A beauty contest judge in Romania did just that - and duly out-danced her own contestants to win the £3,000 top prize.

Cristina Pucean made headlines when she triumphed at the Miss Piranda contest, whose entrants have showcased traditional Roma music and dancing for more than 20 years.

The 19-year-old, who has thousands of fans and dances on the club scene in London, had won a previous title at the age of 16 and was invited back to be one of the judges.

But when the contest took place at a packed sports hall in the capital Bucharest, she jumped over the judges' table to join in, according to a report by the Central European News agency.

There were boos when her performances was given a standing ovation by fellow judge and music promoter Ion Petrisor, 46, dubbed the contest's equivalent of Simon Cowell.

According to the report, he told the crowd: 'I don't know about you, but I thought she was amazing. As far as I'm concerned, she beat the rest hands down, and she definitely deserves the prize.'

But his decision was instantly challenged by the third jury member, Adrian Cristea.

He said that his favourite was one of the original candidates named Ana Maria, 17, and suggested that he would rather give it to her.

The two judges argued until Cristea turned and walked out of the contest as the 5,000-strong audience shouted and catcalled - and the entrants watched in amusement.

According to the report, Cristina later posted on her Facebook page: 'I am sorry that I caused a bit of a mess, it wasn't planned.

'I wasn't even an official candidate, but when I saw everybody dancing and I didn't think they looked up to much, I couldn't contain myself and wanted to rush out and take part in the thrill of the contest. 

'I never thought I'd end up winning, and I can promise everybody that nothing was arranged.' 

Cristina, who adorned her ornate yellow and black outfit with a white Miss Piranda sash, was awarded 4,000 Euros (£3,200) and a one-week holiday in Dubai. 

She wrote: 'I never thought I'd end up winning, and I can promise everybody that nothing was arranged'
