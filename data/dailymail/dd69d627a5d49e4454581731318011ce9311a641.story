Former French first lady Carla Bruni has a new song that appears to poke fun at her husband's political foe, the current president Francois Hollande, who she allegedly brands 'a penguin'.

The 45-year-old model and singer is said to be furious with Mr Hollande after he failed to accompany her husband Nicolas Sarkozy down the Élysée steps after winning the election last year.    

Le Pengouin on Bruni's new album Little French Songs, includes the lyrics: 'He has little sovereign airs but, me, I know him, the penguin doesn't have the manners of a lord of the manor ... Penguins are badly brought up.'

Song bird: Carla Bruni has written a new song which allegedly mocks current French President Francois Hollande, calling him a penguin

According to a report in the Times, the song is widely being seen as an attempt by Bruni, to get revenge on Hollande for what she considers his disrespectful conduct .

In another verse Ms Bruni takes a swipe at Mr Hollande's reputation for being ordinary with the line: 'Neither ugly, nor beautiful, neither tall nor short, neither cold nor hot, the penguin, neither yes nor no.'

Mr Neither-Yes-Nor-No is a nickname for Hollande used by many in the French press to describe his perceived indecisiveness.

Cringeworthy: Another song on Bruni's new album praises her husband Nicolas Sarkozy who she has described as 'virile, sweet and unique'

Bruni also appears to mock the president's official portrait photograph, taken in the gardens of the Élysée Palace with the line 'Hold on, the penguin, you look all alone in your garden.'

The new album includes a cringeworthy tribute to her husband who she recently described as virile, sweet and unique.

The song is believed to have embarrassed many of Sarkozy's political allies and infuriated the Hollande administration.

Many commentators believe the track will effectively blow up in Bruni's face and destroy her efforts to be considered a serious artist.

The former first lady has reportedly told
friends Bruni that Le Pengouin is about Mr Hollande, but she has not 
admitted it publicly.

Snub: Bruni is said to be furious with Hollande after he failed to accompany her husband Nicolas Sarkozy down the Élysée steps after winning the election last year.

In an interview with Le Nouvel Observateur, she said that it was a denunciation of 'badly brought up and disagreeable people, who remain a mystery to me.

Thierry de Cabarrus, a political commentator, said that the song would provide endless conversation at Parisian dinner parties.

He told the Times: 'Some people are certain to take offence at what they will see ... as an insult to the head of state.

'Personally, I find it legitimate because the hatred that opposed the two presidential candidates was sufficiently strong to leave deep marks with both the winner and the loser.'
