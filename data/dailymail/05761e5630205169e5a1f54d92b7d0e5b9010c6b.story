Nigel Farage was in the House of Commons for the first time in 30 years today to see Ukip's first elected MP Douglas Carswell take his seat.

Mr Farage hailed swearing in ceremony as an 'emotional' moment for the party.

It comes after Mr Carswell trounced the Tories in last week's Clacton by-election, triggered by his defection to Ukip in August.

Mr Carswell was shepherded into the chamber by former colleagues Zac Goldsmith and Sir Peter Tapsell – known as the 'father of the house' as the longest-serving MP.

Arriving at Westminster, Mr Farage said he had not been in the Commons since he was 17 - although he has been to the Lords.

Asked if it felt like an emotional moment for the party, he said: 'It does. I think it is a moment. I am here to represent Ukip and the millions of people who we represent.'

As an MEP, Mr Farage does not have automatic access to the parliamentary estate, but was allowed in as the guest of two unnamed members of the House of Lords who sat with him in the peers' gallery in the Commons.

From Mr Farage's position he looked directly down on Tory MPs – many of whom spotted him and exchanged nods.

Before being sworn in, Mr Carswell told journalists he was 'delighted' that Mr Farage would be there.

At the ceremony the Tory benches sat in silence, while Labour MPs heckled.

Mr Carswell's return to Parliament today comes amid pressure on both the Tories and Labour to see off the growing Ukip threat by coming up with policies to cut immigration.

London Mayor Boris Johnson has underlined his calls for Britain to be ready to quit the European Union and demanded curbs on freedom of movement as he made his pitch to win back disaffected voters.

In his regular column for the Daily Telegragh, the Mayor of London wrote: 'It is only reasonable for us to have some kind of further protections - involving points or even quotas, agreed with business - so that we can manage this pressure.

'It would be madness to close our borders to talent; but it is also madness to continue with a system that means we have no idea how many are coming or what burdens they may place on the state.

'Only David Cameron can conceivably deliver those changes, since he is the only leader who can lead reform of the EU. That is the point I hope the kippers (Ukip) will recognise in May next year. And the rest of us should recognise, in turn, that the kippers aren't wicked. They don't hate immigrants; they just hate the lack of control of immigration.'

Ed Miliband will face restive backbenchers at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party tonight after his party came within a whisker of losing the Heywood and Middleton by-election.

Deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted there was no 'wobble' in the Labour ranks and denied a leadership change would be required despite concerns about how voters view the party.

Mr Farage has said Ukip would prop up a minority Conservative government if the Tories agreed to a swift and fair referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.

The Ukip leader accused David Cameron of trying to kick the national vote, planned for 2017 if the Tories win outright next May, 'into the long grass'.

The next by-election battle, which will be fought in Rochester and Strood, could lead to either Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband being ousted if their parties are given a further drubbing, he claimed.

Pressed on who he would prefer to be prime minister after the general election, Mr Farage told the programme: 'Ask me that after the Rochester by-election because I think there is a possibility that one or both of those leaders may not be leading their parties in to the next general election.'

Clacton victor Mr Carswell has insisted the party is on course for victory in the Kent seat being fought by fellow Tory defector Mark Reckless, adding the win would 'fundamentally' change British politics.

Recent polling has put the Eurosceptics nine points ahead and Mr Carswell said it 'felt a little bit like Clacton'.

He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think things are looking OK there. If we can win there then I think things are looking fundamentally different.'
