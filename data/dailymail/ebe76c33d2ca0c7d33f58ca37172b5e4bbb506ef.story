Stepped down: The headmaster at Stanbridge Earls School in rural Hampshire, Peter Trythall, pictured, which is at the centre of shocking sex abuse claims has today resigned

The headmaster of a controversial school at the centre of shocking sex abuse claims has today resigned.

Peter Trythall stepped down from his role at Stanbridge Earls, in Romsey, Hants, 'in the best interests of the school'.

It comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations made by two former students, including a vulnerable young girl.

The £39,000-a-year school caters for youngsters with learning disabilities.

A tribunal ruled earlier this year that the school had discriminated against the pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student.

It found a number of staff members failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain in an intimate part of her body.

And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her.

Mr Trythall was accused of 'a failure of responsibility'.

Furthermore, the Nursing and Midwifery Council confirmed school nurse Melanie Bavington was under investigation.

The governors today said: 'The Governors of Stanbridge Earls School have today accepted the resignation of headmaster Peter Trythall.

'We acknowledge the difficulties he has faced during these last few months, and respect his decision which he has taken in the best interests of the school.

'They are indebted to him for the many things that he has achieved during his tenure of office.

'The day to day management of the school will be in the hands of the two deputies, supported by a specialist SEN Consultant in Leadership and Management, and under the guidance of the Chairman of Governors.

'That will be until such time as an interim head can be appointed.'

The Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal later ordered the school pay the girl’s family £86,000 for legal costs.

She cannot be named for legal reasons.

Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary’s public protection department are examining whether 'further criminal offences' have been committed against other youngsters attending the school.

Both the chairman of the board of governors Tony Knight and a second governor Claire Marsden have already resigned.

The school has vowed to make urgent improvements and to work with outside agencies.
