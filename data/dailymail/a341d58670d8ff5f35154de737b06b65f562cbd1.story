Manchester City star Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding twice in three days.

The £100,000-a-week midfielder was snapped in his Mercedes travelling at 50mph in a 30mph zone on Pottery Lane in Ardwick, Greater Manchester on May 7 last year.

Two days later, on May 9, the Brazil International triggered another speed camera on Chester Road, close to Manchester United’s Old Trafford home, travelling at 40mph in a 30mph area.

The first offence happened on the same day City thumped Aston Villa 4-0 on their way to the Premier League title at the nearby Etihad Stadium. 

The 29-year-old, whose full name is Fernando Luiz Roza, accepted the charges through his lawyer at Manchester Magistrates Court.

Magistrates were told that there had been a delay in responding to requests for information from police as the player was at the World Cup in his homeland when they landed on the door of his home.

Fernandinho, who arrived at Manachester City in a £30million deal in 2013, lives in the leafy, footballer-filled Cheshire village of Prestbury with wife Glaucia and their young son Davi.

The footballer, who already had six points on his licence from two other speeding offences, did not attend court.

The Brazilian midfielder was also fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge

The midfielder is likely to be in Manuel Pellegrini's squad to face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 

According to Manchester Evening News Nick Terry, defending the footballer, told the court:'Mr Roza accepts he has made mistakes here. He has not been driving until he has confirmation of this result. 

'Mr Roza does play for Manchester City but I would ask you to consider him as you would any other defendant.

'The law is not blind and whether he is an office worker or footballer, I would ask that he is treated the same.'  

He was banned for six months, fined £580 and ordered to pay £170 costs and a £58 victim surcharge.
