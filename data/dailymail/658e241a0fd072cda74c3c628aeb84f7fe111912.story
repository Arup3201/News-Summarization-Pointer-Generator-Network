Grady Stiles III talked about his father, Grady Styles, Jr. in an upcoming episode of the AMC program 'Freakshow,' which airs on Tuesday.

Like his father, Stiles III was born with ectrodactyly, a congenital disorder that makes hands and feet resemble claw-like appendages. Stiles IIi, along with his sister, who also has the disorder, toured around the country with their father as the 'Lobster Family.'

Grady Stiles III, son of Grady Stiles Jr., better known as 'Lobster Boy,' says his father was a 'drunken bastard' who was killed by a man hired by his mother after his parents got into a fight

Grady Stiles Jr., known as 'Lobster Boy,' shows off his claw-like hands caused by a congenital condition known as ectrodactyly. He was known to be verbally and physically abuse to his family, and sometimes others as well

'I'm not a fan of my dad as a person,' Stiles III says on the program. 'My father was racist [and] abusive. When I cried, [he was like] "I'll give you a reason a to cry."'

He added that his father was a big drinker and that as a result, 'it brought out the worst in him.'

Grady Stiles Jr. was known to drink whiskey and smoke three packs of cigarettes a day, according to the Huffington Post. He was also know to be verbally and physically abusive to people.

He gained notoriety in 1978 when he shot and killed his oldest daughter's fiance in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the eve of their wedding. During the trial the following year, Stiles Jr. openly confessed to the murder.Â 

But he avoided jail time and instead got 15 years of probation since no prison in Pennsylvania was equipped to handle an inmate with ectrodactyly.

Mary was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit first degree murder for the death of her carnival sideshow husband, Grady Stiles Jr., better known as 'Lobster Boy'

In November 1992, Stiles Jr., 55, was shot dead by a 17-year-old sideshow performer, Chris Wyant, who was allegedly hired to do the hit by Stiles wife, Maria, and her son from another marriage.

At he trial, Mrs. Stiles told the judge, 'My husband was going to kill my family. I believe that from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry this happened, but my family is safe now.'

But Stiles III now says his father's murder didn't happen exactly as was told in court.

'What actually happened was my mother and my dad had gotten in another fight as usual and my mother had made the comment that something needed to be done,' Stiles III said. 'My brother had overheard that and went to the neighbor kid and told him that something had to be done.

'My brother thought that meant scaring him or beating [my dad] up or something to make him realize that he was going to lose his family. A little while later, my dad was shot.'
