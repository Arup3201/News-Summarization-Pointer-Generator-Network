An opportunist thief didn't hesitate to steal a £1,000 wad of notes which were accidentally dropped by an unlucky customer at a Poundland checkout.

CCTV footage has been released which shows the moment Gary Bickerdike inadvertently drops an envelope stuffed with £1,000 from his pocket as he pays for goods at the Crawley branch of the value store.

Moments later Mr Bickerdike leaves the shop and the heartless thief  bends over and discreetly scoops up the cash.

Caught on camera: A woman can be seen bending over and picking up the wad of
 notes which have just been dropped by Gary Bickerdike before leaving the 
store with them

The suspect is a blonde woman who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers.

Mr
 Bickerdike, a 53-year-old from Crawley in West Sussex, said he had only
 just taken the money out of the bank to pay for repairs to his 
conservatory, but decided popped into Poundland on his way home.

The woman can be seen on the footage putting her foot over the cash as she chats with the sales assistant while paying for goods.

After stooping down to pick up the money she then promptly leaves the store with the cash.

Just minutes later a desperate Mr Bickerdike returned to the store to try and recover his money but it was long gone.

Police this week released the CCTV footage in a bid to track down the thief and they want anyone who knows the suspect to contact them.

Mr Bickerdike, said: 'I am absolutely disgusted. The envelope had a window so it would have been possible to see that money was inside it.

foot

'I think it is despicable that someone would just pick up and take an envelope full of money when they would have known it was mine.

'Times are hard for everyone and we have a leaking conservatory at home which needs fixing. I've had to put those plans on the back burner now.

'It is a lot of money and has taken me about a year and a half to save up for it.'

The incident happened on May 12 and a police spokesman has urged anyone who recognises the suspect to call them.
