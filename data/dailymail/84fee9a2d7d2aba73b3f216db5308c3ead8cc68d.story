Women are to be allowed to serve on submarines for the first time in the Royal Navy’s history.

Female officers can serve beneath the waves on Vanguard-class subs, which carry the Trident nuclear deterrent, from 2013, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced yesterday.

Women of lower rank will follow two years later, when they will be able to serve on the new state-of-the-art £1.2billion Astute-class ‘hunter-killer’ submarines.

The announcement breaks more than 100 
years of tradition. Women had been barred from subs because of concerns 
that carbon dioxide in the recycled air could damage their fertility.

There were also concerns among top 
brass that the presence of women could create disruptive relationships 
on underwater missions that often last months.

But Mr Hammond said he was scrapping 
the long-standing ban on females on the recommendation of Admiral Sir 
Mark Stanhope, the head of the Navy, after experts at the Institute of 
Naval Medicine concluded that health fears were ‘unfounded’.

Pregnant sailors, however, will still be banned from going to sea amid concerns that fumes could damage an unborn child.

Addressing the Royal United Services 
Institute think-tank, Mr Hammond said Britain’s Armed Forces would 
‘value our history and tradition – but we will not be slaves to them’.

The lifting of the ban ends one of the
last all-male bastions of the Armed Forces following pressure to 
introduce equal opportunities throughout the military.

Wrens have served on Royal Navy 
surface ships since a ban was lifted two decades ago, and about 9 per 
cent of personnel are now female.

The Australian, Canadian, Danish, 
Swedish and Norwegian navies already allow women to serve on their 
submarines. And last year the U.S. axed the ban on female submariners.

The new Astute attack submarines could easily be adapted so females have their own areas with showers and beds.

Philip Hammond has confirmed that the final estimate of the cost of military operations in Libya was £212million.

The figure is less than the last estimate issued by the Ministry of Defence in October of £300million.

The fall is primarily due to a drop in the estimated cost of replacing spent munitions from £140million to £67million.

Mr Hammond stressed there was no going back on the cuts in the Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).

'The situation we face now - after the years of political failure to grip the problem - is that eliminating the black hole in the defence budget is the only way to sustain military capability over the long-term,' he said.

'Of course there are many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of individual capabilities. But let's be under no illusions - unpicking the SDSR piece by piece is simply not an option.'
