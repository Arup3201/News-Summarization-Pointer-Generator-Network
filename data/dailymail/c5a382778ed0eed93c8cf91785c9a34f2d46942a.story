Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers felt Everton's Gareth Barry was lucky to stay on the field at Anfield – and most neutral observers would agree with him.

Barry was cautioned in the second-minute for a foul on Adam Lallana and then blocked Raheem Sterling's shot with his arm inside the penalty area after eight minutes.

Referee Martin Atkinson waved away the penalty appeals and then spared Barry again after 10 minutes when he clipped Mario Balotelli.

The Liverpool playmaker looked in some pain after the challenge but was able to carry on playing

Rodgers said only half in jest: 'Gareth Barry grabbed it with both arms. It was nearly a save! And Martin (Atkinson) had a good look at it.

'For us it was a clear penalty. If the ball strikes your hand around the waste, that is one thing, but his arms were up above his head. If the penalty had been given, he (Barry) would have gone and maybe that was in the referee's mind.'

Rodgers also praised Balotelli for refusing to react to some heavy Everton tackling. 'I think it is important for him to focus on his game. You only have a chance to win if you have 11 players on the field,' said the Reds manager. 'I thought his work rate was excellent.'
