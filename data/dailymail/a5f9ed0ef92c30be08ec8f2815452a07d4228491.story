Indestructible cat Andrea caused a sensation when she miraculously survived two attempts to put her down in a gas
chamber last autumn. Now the feline's found a new home where she'll be much safer.

It also seems West Valley City, Utah, may soon close its
carbon monoxide chamber in the face of opposition from volunteers at
the local animal shelter, whose cause has been promoted by the cat.

They claim lethal sodium pentobarbital injections are
cheaper and more suitable than the ‘inhumane and expensive’ gas chamber. It
follows the double-survival of stray black cat Andrea in October.

Alive: Indestructible cat Andrea miraculously survived two attempts to put her down in a gas chamber in Utah. She is pictured with animal shelter volunteer Janita Coombs and has now been found a permanent home

Staff at the Utah animal shelter made the decision to
euthanise Andrea after 30 days because no one had adopted her and there was no
space to continue to keep her.

But she survived her trip into the carbon monoxide gas
chamber. After the attempt to gas her she still showed signs of life, so a
further attempt to put her down was made.

The astonished employee ran the gas once more before placing
Andrea in a plastic bag and leaving her body in a cooler, reported the Salt
Lake Tribune.

Less than an hour later the same staff member was placing
the body of a dog in the freezer when he heard a ‘meow’, reported WPTV. Tearing
open the bag he found her looking terrified but alive.

After finding her alive in the bag, the workers agreed that
they should not try to kill the cat again. She was put up for adoption by an animal
welfare group and they found her a permanent home.

Survivor: Andrea had originally been taken to the West Valley City Animal Shelter by officers because she was a stray, though workers believed she had been someone's pet

'It was just one of those things where they thought this cat
obviously really wants to live,' West Valley City spokesman Aaron Crim said at the time.
'Let’s give it a chance to find a permanent home.'

Despite the strange incident, the shelter stood by its
euthanasia methods at the time, which are recommended by the American Veterinarian
Association.

'She’s pretty tough, obviously. She’s definitely got some will to live'

‘We’ve never had an instance like this since we started
using this method so it does work,’ a shelter spokesman said in October. ‘It’s
actually very human and it’s very quick. This is just an anomaly.’

Andrea had been taken to the West Valley City Animal Shelter
by officers because she was a stray, though workers believed she had been
someone’s pet.

‘She’s pretty tough, obviously,’ Community Animal Welfare
Society volunteer Janita Coombs told the Salt Lake Tribune at the time. ‘She’s definitely
got some will to live.’
