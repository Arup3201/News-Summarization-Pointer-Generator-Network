A photographer has captured the moment thousands of immigrants try to illegally cross the border from Mexico into the US.

Photojournalist John Moore documented thousands of immigrants – many of them children – being detained by the US Border Patrol in Falfurrias, Texas.

Officers work in the 100 degree heat before taking the immigrants into custody on Tuesday, July 22.

From there they will try and work out where the immigrants have come from and return them to their country of origin.

Previous reports suggest the majority of immigrants have been smuggled in from Mexico, but others from El Salvador, Honduras and the Dominican Republic have also been detained.

More than 57,000 minors have been apprehended since October 2013, compared to 27,884 the previous year, showing a 106 per cent increase.

Texas Governor Rick Perry announced that he will send 1,000 National Guard troops to help stem the flow within the next 30 days.

Speaking at a news conference in Austin, Mr Perry said: ‘I will not stand idly by while our citizens are under assault and little children from Central America are detained in squalor.’

He blames the Obama administration for not keeping Texas secure and said the troops will be integrated into a state law enforcement program called Operation Strong Safety, which is aimed at preventing criminal activity by Mexican drug cartels on the Texas side of the border.

The guardsmen will not be empowered to apprehend anyone but rather will help identify potential criminal activity and alert law enforcement officers.

This is not the first tome National Guard troops along the US – Mexico border have been deployed.

In 2006, President George W. Bush posted 6,000 guardsmen for two years in several Southern border states to build security fences and operate surveillance equipment under a program called Operation Jump Start.

Mr Moore has been covering immigration stories in the U.S. since the 2010 introduction of Arizona's controversial law that allowed police to stop anyone they believed may be in the country illegally.
