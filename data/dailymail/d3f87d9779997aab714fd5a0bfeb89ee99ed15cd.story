Australian children are among the least active in the world, ranking behind those in the UK, Europe, Africa and South America, according to a major international study taken across 15 countries.

The Active Healthy Kids study reveals just 20 per cent of the Australia’s children aged between five and 17 get 60 minutes of exercise per day.

It means four out of five Australian children are failing to meet the government's recommended physical activity guidelines.

Australia's children were given a D- for Overall Physical Activity as part of a study which ranked 15 of the world's countries by the physical activity of their children

The report, which surveyed 15,000 people, also revealed that more than 70 per cent of Australian children spend two hours a day or more in front of an electronic screen.

The study looked at the daily physical activity of children from 15 countries. After combining data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the National Secondary Student's Diet and Activity survey, researchers scored Australia a D- for overall physical activity, .

For Sedentary Behaviors, or screen time, Australia also received a D-, while Active Transportation received a D.

In the Family and Peers category which looks into positive exercise influences, Australia received a C while Government Strategies and Investments received a C+.

The only areas that looked positive, were Organized Sport Participation, B-, and Community And The Built Environment, in which Australia received an A-.

But experts warn Australia's participation in organised sport is simply not enough. The report's lead author and research associate at the University of South Australia, Natasha Schranz, said the results prove Australia has 'fallen behind'.

'It's alarming that a nation committed to sport has fallen so far behind in incidental activity,' Dr Schranz told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'We are just shutting it out. We need to do more active transport, reduce sitting and television time and incorporate active play into everyday life.'

The Active Healthy Kids Australia report card found that more than 80 per cent of Australia's children failed to get the recommended 60 minutes of exercise a day

Heart Foundation physical activity spokesman, Trevor Shilton, said the study’s results need to be taken seriously as the potential health implications could be disastrous for Australian children in the future

'We're raising a generation of couch potatoes,' he said, recommending that schools introduce 2½ hours of mandatory physical education a week.

'Far too many kids are being driven to school and spend most of their time sitting when they get there. There is nothing inherent in children that makes them sedentary, which makes this very worrisome.'
