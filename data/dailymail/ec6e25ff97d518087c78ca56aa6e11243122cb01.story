A bizarre sex tape starring Hulk Hogan, his overweight best friend Bubba the Love Sponge and his ex-wife has been leaked online.

The 59-year-old star, who previously admitted he had starred in the wild tape, can be seen performing a sex act on the woman before telling the lucky lady he 'felt like a pig' after eating just ten minutes before filming.

According to Radar Online, the obliging female is Heather Clem, who is the ex-wife of Hulk's best friend, radio DJ Bubba the Love Sponge.

Caught out! Hulk Hogan's sex tape has now leaked onto the internet

The website has reported that the tape is 30 minutes long, and that Gawker.com has obtained a one-minute clip of it.

In the clip, the professional wrestler can be seen engaging in a sex act with the brunette after a man thought to be his friend Bubba is seen leaving the room.

Bubba, who legally changed his name by deed poll, is mentioned in the video as Hulk asks his partner if she had slept with him earlier that day.

It has also been said that Hulk receives a call from his son Nick during the bedroom antics, but instead of answering the phone, he responds: 'F*** no!'

Following their intimate moment, Hulk begins dressing himself before telling the woman that he 'felt like a pig' after eating just ten minutes before they filmed.

Obliging: The woman involved in the sex tape is said to be Heather Clem (L), the ex-wife of Hulk's best friend, radio DJ Bubba the Love Sponge (R)

Happier times: Hulk revealed earlier this year that the woman in the sex tape must have been a brunette he 'ran wild' with following his split from wife Linda

As he leaves the room, he turns to the woman and says: 'You’re a hot commodity.'

It is thought that the tape was filmed shortly after Hulk's split from his wife Linda in 2007.

Speaking
about the time the tape must have been made, Hulk told TMZ.com in 
March: 'It wasn't just one brunette I was running wild for a few 
months.'

He also said: 'I don't even remember people's names much less girls.'

The
wrestling legend said the tape must be at least five years old because 
he has been with current wife Jennifer McDaniel that long.

But it unknown exactly what McDaniel thinks of her husband's latest look - a two-tone beard.

Day and night: Hulk Hogan and Scott Disick cosy up for the camera at LIV nightclub in Miami on Wednesday

The odd couple: The muscular wrestling champion and the dapper reality TV squire make friends

Hulk
modelled the bizarre facial hair during a night out in Miami on Wednesday where he bumped into reality TV star Scott Disick.

As
a dapper Scott leaned in to his muscular friend, Scott's new-found 
appreciation for a little facial hair paled in comparison to the bold 
look sported by committed mustachio connoisseur Hulk.

The 12-time world wrestling champion, real name Terry Gene Bollea, paraded his trademark white handlebar moustache, contrasting it against a startling jet-black beard growth of several days.

Hulk wore blue denim jeans, a brown leather belt and a head scarf, posing for the cameras with his shirt off.

Scott, meanwhile, looked his usual dapper self in a crisp white collared shirt and dark suit.

The two men also posed with Hulk's son Nick, 22, who wore a white T-shirt, sunglasses and a red N.W.A. cap.

Also at LIV nightclub, which is next to Miami's famed Fontainbleau Hotel, was Scott's partner's sister Kim Kardashian, who tweeted a photo of herself also posing with Hulk.

Wearing a figure-hugging white cocktail dress, Kim lifts her arm and makes a fist while standing next to the wrestler.

Next to the photo she wrote:  'What you gonna do...when you have @hulkhogan in the house!!!!'

The Kardashian clan have been regulars at LIV since they started filming in Miami.

The club is known for its glitzy crowd and expensive prices, where the cover charge is regularly $60 and drinks start at around $20.

The Kardashian clan - including Kim, Kourtney and Khloe - have been in Miami, Florida, filming for their reality show Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, a spin-off of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
