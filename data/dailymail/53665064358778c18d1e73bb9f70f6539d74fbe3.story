If you think Arsene Wenger's got problems, spare a throughout for Alan Irvine.

The dark clouds that have hovered over Arsenal are slowly drifting away.

Their second win in four days, courtesy of Danny Welbeck's winner at the Hawthorns, eased the pressure on the Gunners manager.

There was no such luck for West Brom manager Irvine, though; his own supporters turned against him as they suffered a fourth defeat in five games.

Wenger, however, still isn't out of the woods. Certainly not with a section of the club's support.

Even as they celebrated victory, supporters made their feeling towards Wenger crystal clear.

One banner had: 'Arsene thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye', emblazoned across it, another read: 'Enough is enough, Wenger out.'

‘I don’t want to comment on that,’ said the Arsenal manager.

‘I try to do my best for the club that I love. We are very united with the players and staff around the team, that’s all you can do.’

Nevertheless, the Frenchman will return to London with renewed optimism as his side recorded their first league win since November 1 and are finally seeing key players return to fitness.

He was able to revert back to his preferred central defensive partnership of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny, the France international fully-recovered from an Achilles problem to make his first appearance in two months.

Likewise, Olivier Giroud made his first start since the end of August following a broken ankle at the Hawthorns, though keeper Wojciech Szczesny again missed out with a hip injury as third choice Damien Martinez made his second consecutive start.

For West Brom, all eyes and hopes were pinned on Saido Berahino, who was making his first appearance since details of his drink-driving offence emerged earlier this week. 

Interestingly, Danny Welbeck started the clash out on the left with the fit again Giroud preferred as the lone striker.

Following their morale-boosting win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, Arsenal started brightly - Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez testing Ben Foster with efforts from the edge of the box inside the opening 10 minutes.

After a run of one win in seven, Irvine's side were understandably tentative in the opening exchanges.

Arsenal were forced into an early change, Kieran Gibbs replacing Nacho Monreal at left back as the Gunners' rotten luck regarding injuries continued in the 23rd minute.

Foster was called upon again in the 25th minute denying Welbeck in a one-on-one following Aaron Ramsey's through ball.

The Gunners were then denied a penalty by referee Chris Foy after Giroud fell in the box following a tangle with Youssouf Mulumbu.

West Brom's hearts were in their mouths two minutes later when Giroud dispossessed Foster, who had gone walkabout near the left hand touchline, but the Frenchman failed to direct the ball into an empty net from a tight angle.

Foster was smiling, his manager wasn't as amused, though, as Arsenal asserted their authority.

Giroud and Welbeck combined to set up up Cazorla on the edge of the area, but, with time to steady himself, the Spaniard sent another shot straight at Foster.

Arsenal were well on top at this point. But Wenger and the visiting support had seen this all before. Not turning domination in goals is becoming somewhat of an unwanted Arsenal trait of late. 

Wenger knew it, too, pacing anxiously along his technical area despite the fact his side were fully in charge.

The chances kept coming - and being wasted; Ramsey this time firing wide from 16 yards after Mulumbu foolishly dallied on the ball on the edge of his own area.

Had Stephane Sessegnon produced a better pass after easily beating Calum Chambers down the left on the stroke of half-time then Wenger would have had much more to think about at half-time.

The second half started in similar fashion to the first, Welbeck showing indecisiveness in front of goal, choosing to pass to Ramsey when shooting would have been a much better option in the 51st minute.

Mertesacker then fired wide from the edge of a crowded penalty area after Foster fumbled under pressure from Giroud.

Then, in the 54th minute, came West Brom's best opening off the game, Berahino springing Arsenal's offside trap only to shoot into the side-netting with Martinez to beat.

It wasn't the finish the striker was looking for in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, who was at the Hawthorns yesterday.

Nor was it the finish Irvine wanted, who knew full well a chance like that may not arrive again in the 35 minutes remaining.

And just five minutes later, West Brom paid the ultimate price as Cazorla sped past Andre Wisdom down Arsenal's left before standing up an inch perfect cross for Welbeck to head past Foster.

It was no more than Arsenal deserved, not that would have been any comfort to Irvine who would of had Berahino's miss still in the forefront of his thoughts.

West Brom supporters were just as frustrated, directing their anger at Irvine in the 76th minute, showing their displeasure at his decision to replace Sessegnon with Georgious Samaras crystal clear with cries of 'You don't know what you're doing.'

But 10 minutes from the end their jeers nearly turned to cheers after Berahino hit the crossbar with a towering header from substitute Cristian Gamboa's cross.

Craig Gardner then smashed a 20 yard effort narrowly wide of Martinez's left hand post as the Baggies pressed for an unlikely leveller. But Arsenal held on to secure a vital victory.
