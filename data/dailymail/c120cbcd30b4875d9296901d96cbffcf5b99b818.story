If ever a game had it all, this was it. Northampton Saints produced one of the greatest backs-to-the-wall performances ever witnessed in the Aviva Premiership, shrugging off the red card shown to their serial miscreant Dylan Hartley to somehow secure an epic victory in a seething East Midlands derby.

Hartley’s moment of madness will attract plenty of attention — and rightly so. But anyone present at this game will remember one of the most committed, brave and high-quality displays of recent times by 14-man Saints.

In what was unquestionably the finest game of the season so far, Northampton centre Luther Burrell still managed to deliver a performance that stood out from the crowd.

England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens

April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor.

March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain.

March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test.

June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain.

December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best.

May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing.

December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith.

A fractured hand sustained against the Ospreys robbed the 17 stone centre of a chance to impress for England in the autumn. 

But on this evidence, Stuart Lancaster can already pen Burrell’s name on his team-sheet to face Wales on February 6. He was that good.

Hartley was sent to the stands by referee JP Doyle for a reckless elbow to the face of Leicester centre Matt Smith. 

But Burrell and his team-mates rolled their sleeves up to deliver one of the great Franklins’ Gardens wins.

Replacement Jamie Elliott scored the 77th-minute winning try that will etch his name into Northampton folklore after Vereniki Goneva looked to have won the game for the visitors five minutes earlier.

But there were heroes all over the field for director of rugby Jim Mallinder’s team, with Burrell and lock Christian Day to the fore.

Spare a thought for Saints centre Tom Stephenson, who was replaced 16 minutes into the game following Hartley’s latest disciplinary meltdown. Even he will surely have toasted this remarkable win last night.

‘We said at half time we’ll do this for Dylan and we’ll do this for Stevo,’ said man-of-the-match Burrell.

‘That’s what it means to play for this club. It doesn’t get much better than that in a local derby.’

The tone was set before Hartley was sent off for the second time in his career amid an atmosphere unrivalled in English club rugby.

Last year, Saints prop Salesi Ma’afu was sent off for punching Leicester hooker Tom Youngs. The pair exchanging digs from minute one yesterday.

But Hartley, who was last night facing the fifth ban of his career, left his side facing over an hour without their leader. Luckily for him his troops raised their game in epic fashion in a match which saw the lead change hands six times.

Goneva’s try — created by a stunning, weaving run from replacement wing Miles Benjamin — looked to have sealed victory for coach Richard Cockerill’s side as Freddie Burns converted to make the score 19-16 with less than 10 minutes left.

But, after turning down a kickable penalty which would have drawn the scores level, Northampton claimed a line-out and Burrell charged up the middle to set up a platform which led to Stephen Myler putting Elliott in for the vital score.

‘Fitness is one thing we pride ourselves on,’ said Burrell. ‘Our conditioning staff are fantastic. We like to play a high-tempo game.

‘We knew going down to 14 players was going to be tough. It takes a lot to come from a try down. What an amazing feeling.’

While Burrell was sensational, Hartley’s replacement Mike Haywood was almost his equal. Day also carried the ball impressively, while Myler controlled the game superbly from stand off.

He was, however, inexplicably allowed back onto the field after appearing to be knocked senseless in the lead-up to Ben Foden’s second-half try.

Leicester, who lost Tom Croft to the sin bin for a high tackle on Ken Pisi just before half time, will be distraught to have lost a game they really should have closed out in Hartley’s absence.

But they lacked ballast in the midfield and, a superb scrummaging performance apart, their forwards lacked bite. When Northampton used width, the visitors defence was all at sea.

Both sides scored three tries, with Leicester’s coming through a brace from Goneva and a 21st-minute penalty try, while Alex Waller, Foden and Elliott touched down for Saints.

Mallinder said: ‘It was a tremendous, spirited performance with a lot of good technical and tactical work which was so pleasing.’

This match really did have it all.
