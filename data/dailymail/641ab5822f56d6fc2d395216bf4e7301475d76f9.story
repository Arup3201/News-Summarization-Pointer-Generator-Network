Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter have been thrown World Cup lifelines after receiving surprise call-ups for Stuart Lancaster's England training squad ahead of next month's Six Nations tournament.

The Sale fly-half and veteran Harlequins No 8 were not set to be included this weekend, but a change of thinking following a selection meeting on Monday has seen them named in a 34-man squad which will train together before the opening clash with Wales on February 6.

Cipriani, 27, in outstanding form this season, is one of four fly-halves in the squad - which does not contain injured stars Manu Tuilagi (groin), Courtney Lawes (ankle), Joe Launchbury (neck) and Ben Morgan (ankle) - with George Ford, Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler also named.

Forwards: D Attwood (Bath), C Clark (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester), A Corbisiero (Northampton), N Easter (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), G Kitchener (Leicester), G Kruis (Saracens), J Marler (Harlequins), G Parling (Leicester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola, M Vunipola (both Saracens), D Wilson (Bath), T Wood (Northampton), T Youngs (Leicester)

Backs: B Barritt (Saracens), M Brown (Harlequins), L Burrell (Northampton), D Care (Harlequins), D Cipriani (Sale), K Eastmond (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), A Goode (Saracens), J Joseph (Bath), J May (Gloucester,), S Myler (Northampton), J Nowell (Exeter), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), A Watson (Bath), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), B Youngs (Leicester) 

The mercurial No 10 is still thought to be fourth in England's pecking order but his inclusion in the squad provides a huge boost after he'd resigned himself to being omitted.

Easter, who will be 37 by the time the World Cup begins in September, has not played for England since the 2011 World Cup, but has also been rewarded for his excellent club form.

'Danny hasn't been far away at all since the New Zealand tour and he was in camp in August,' said Lancaster.

'He's improved his game and worked hard and we want to create an opportunity for him to come in and put a marker down alongside Stephen Myler.

'With Ben Morgan's injury we need two specialist No 8s and Nick has been outstanding this season.

'We base a lot of our decisions on training and we have a very competitive squad. We have a two-week period to prepare and we will use that time wisely.'

Nick Easter's last appearance in an England shirt was the 2011 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France

Forwards

K Brookes (Newcastle Falcons), T Croft (Leicester Tigers), C Day (Northampton Saints), L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), D Ewers (Exeter Chiefs), M Garvey (Bath Rugby), R Harrison (Sale Sharks), M Itoje (Saracens), M Kvesic (Gloucester Rugby), M Mullan (Wasps), H Thomas (Bath Rugby), T Waldrom (Exeter Chiefs), A Waller (Northampton Saints), R Webber (Bath Rugby)

Backs

C Ashton (Saracens), S Burgess (Bath Rugby), E Daly (Wasps), O Devoto (Bath Rugby), L Dickson (Northampton Saints, captain), C Pennell (Worcester Warriors), J Simpson (Wasps), H Slade (Exeter Chiefs), M Yarde (Harlequins), C Wade (Wasps)

Commenting on his inclusion in the England Six Nations Squad, Danny Cipriani said, ' I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to join up with the squad next week and look forward to training with them and developing my game. 

'It's a great chance for me to prove myself and hopefully get a chance to represent my country again. I would like to thank everyone at Sale Sharks for helping me make this happen.' 

Leicester's uncapped lock Graham Kitchener is included – in place of the injured Lawes - in a squad which also contains six returning British Lions – Alex Corbisero, Dan Cole, Geoff Parling, Tom Youngs and Mako Vunipola.

Chris Robshaw will captain the side through the Six Nations despite concerns over a shoulder injury.

'Looking at both squads it's obvious there is a lot of depth and competition in every position, which is what we want. Many players are putting their hand up in the Aviva Premiership and Europe and they have a chance to impress in training as we build towards the games against Wales and the Wolfhounds.

'It's great to welcome back some of those players unavailable for the QBE Internationals in the autumn. They offer us a lot of quality and experience. So too Nick Easter, who has played well for Harlequins and, with the injury to Ben Morgan, both he and Tom Waldrom in the Saxons will provide us with specialist No 8 options alongside Billy Vunipola. That's something we feel we need going into the tournament.

'We have plenty of players to consider and with some players still being assessed from last weekend after suffering knocks we have kept our options open.

'It's a big European weekend ahead and there may be further changes once we assess the fitness of the players after round six and we will provide an update on Monday.'

Rugby-league convert Sam Burgess is named in the Saxons squad to face the Irish Wolfhounds in Cork on January.

'We're really pleased with his progress,' said attack coach Andy Farrell. 'There will be a lot of ups and downs and it's a steep learning curve but for him to be involved with the Saxons is great for him.'
