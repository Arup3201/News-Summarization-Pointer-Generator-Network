A couple whose house was trashed by a past tenant and stripped bare by thieves have put their three-bedroomed terrace on the market rent free - as long as the occupier doesn't mind renovating the property while they live there.

Private landlords Jax Ayton, 30, and her husband David, 46, have made the unusual proposition as they look for a DIY enthusiast to take on their Darlington property.

They hope that a new resident can give the end terrace a new lease of life after it was left uninhabitable by a previous tenant.

She was evicted after knocking holes in the walls, burning the garage down and allowing her pet cat to defecate all over the floor.

But the couple's nightmare didn't end when the tenant finally moved out.

Once the property was empty, metal thieves smashed their way in through rear windows and stripped the house of it pipes, boiler and electrical wiring.

Repairs will now cost between £17,000 and £23,000.

Mrs Ayton said: 'It was a lovely house, it was all done up to a good standard and it was a nice place to live.

'This tenant completely trashed the place so obviously we asked her to leave.

'We couldn't afford to do it up again and slowly but surely people noticed it was empty and it became a target.

'They've taken everything except the floorboards - the circuit board, the boiler and all the piping has gone.

'It's in a desperate state of disrepair.'

Jax, originally from Aberdeen, added:
'We found the property in the state it was in after the tenant fell 
into arrears. We were absolutely devastated.

'She
had been a tenant at another of our houses, but it was badly damaged in
a chip pan fire and we re-homed her in another one of our properties.

The house was left in a terrible state of disrepair after a previous tenant trashed the place and metal thieves stripped it bare

Jax and David Ayton are now hoping that a new tenant can fix the mess their terrace has been left in, pictured, and give the house a new lease of life

The house will need completely gutting after the previous tenant put holes in he walls, allowed her dog to defecate everywhere and burnt the garage down

Metal thieves smashed into the house through the rear windows, which are seen here boarded up

'We were carrying out refurbishment to the home she had left, and the one she  moved into was beautiful.

'The previous tenants had really looked after it. We spruced it up for her but it came to light that she'd fallen into arrears.

'We found out the property was ruined in January, so we took steps to evict her. It's a lengthy process and the law is not on the side of landlords, so she left the property in April.'

The Ayton's, who own seven properties in Darlington and a further house in Newcastle, will make the house safe to live in by fitting new windows and electrics before anyone moves in - but the tenant will be expected to do all the DIY work to their own taste.

Any building materials needed to return the house to its former glory will be supplied by the pair.

The Aytons will charge between £425 and £475 per month to rent the house, pictured left, when extensive renovations to damage, right, are carried out

Landlord Jax Ayton says that pretty much all that is left of the terraced house is the floorboards. But even some of those are missing judging by this photo

Thieves even went so far as stealing pipes, cables and the electric circuit board from the house

The property hardly looks like an ideal love nest now, but its owners are hoping that new DIY-loving tenants will breath new life into the house

And once the drastic makeover is complete, they will start to charge the occupiers rent - between £425 and £475 per month, in line with similar properties in the area.

Mrs Ayton said that the pair will hold X Factor-style auditions to make sure that they rent the house to a reliable tenant this time around.

She said: 'We're expecting an X-Factor audition process where people will talk us through what they want to do to the property.

'We'll find out who is genuine about the property and who just wants free rent.

'The design they choose has to be agreeable and liveable, so we'll come to an agreement over what they are going to do and that will be written into the contract.'

Even the ceilings of the Darlington terrace will need a renovation as this picture shows

With some TLC, this space could become a dream living room for the home's new occupants

The couple will fit new windows and electrics, but a new tenant will be expected to redecorate the house while living there rent-free

In good condition it would rent for up to £475 a month
