His receipt bears the slogan ‘Saving You Money Every Day’.

But a quick trip to his local supermarket for a few breakfast basics turned out to be the most expensive of John Brown’s life.

The warehouse worker was charged £450 for a loaf of bread after he rushed a handful of goods through a self-service till – and neglected to check the receipt.

When John Brown, 37, made a quick visit to Asda for some groceries, he was charged £450 for a loaf of bread

Ironically, Mr Brown had purchased the loaf only because he saw it was reduced!

He visited the Asda store on March 15 
to buy eggs, but picked up his favourite wheatgrain loaf when he noticed
 it was on offer. He also bought jam and another cut-price loaf which he
 planned to freeze.

The 
groceries should have come to £3.88, but Mr Brown was so keen to get 
home for breakfast he did not notice the exorbitant total on the till or
 the debit card machine.

It 
was only when he printed a mini-statement at a cash machine later that 
day that he noticed his most recent transaction was for £453.19 at the 
store in Jack Hayward Way, Wolverhampton.

When the 37-year-old
 checked his Asda receipt, he discovered the £1.25 Roberts Bakery Malted
 Wheatgrain loaf – supposedly reduced to 69p – had cost him £450.

Yesterday
 Mr Brown, who lives a short walk from the shop, admitted he should have
 checked the amount before typing in his debit card PIN.

Mr Brown says he only noticed the error when we went to withdraw money to buy a new car days later

‘I
 regularly use the self-service tills as they are generally quicker than
 queuing for a manned till,’ he said.

‘I just like to get in and get out
 of these supermarkets. I got a terrible shock when I realised what had 
happened – I hadn’t even looked at the total when I paid as I’d only 
bought a couple of items and knew what the bill should roughly come to.

‘It’s
 made me think twice about using a self-service machine again. I think 
the safest course of action will be to use cash in future.’

The
 error scuppered Mr Brown’s attempt to purchase a car as it left him 
unable to put down a deposit. He complained to the supermarket and has 
now received a refund and a £15 gift card.

An
 Asda spokesman said the error was an ‘isolated incident’ relating to an
 error on the coding of the reduced price sticker attached to the loaf.

He added: ‘The system glitch meant that the bread was scanned at the wrong price.

‘It goes without saying that we’re sorry for any inconvenience caused to Mr Brown.'
