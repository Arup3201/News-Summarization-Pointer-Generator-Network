A Florida man has been charged with battery after allegedly punching a pizza deliveryman in the face ‘because he forgot the garlic knots,’ according to a police report.

Robert Wheeler, 48, was arrested nearly two weeks ago following the skirmish that broke out outside a house in his hometown of Vero Beach.

The deliveryman, 19-year-old Jonathon Feigen, told investigators that the 346-pound Wheeler struck him below the left eye after he rolled down the window of his vehicle.

Charged: Robert Wheeler, 48, is accused of punching a 19-year-old deliveryman in the face for failing to bring him garlic knots

Feigen, who had slight redness and swelling in the spot where he was hit, according to the police report, had initially declined medical attention, according to the Smoking Gun.

However, his mother later contacted River County Sheriff’s Office deputies and said that she was taking her son to an emergency room because he was complaining of headache and nausea.

On August 19, shortly before 6pm, Feigen pulled up to a house at 445 9th Street Southwest, where Wheeler was waiting for him.

The 48-year-old, who has the words ‘Fat’ and ‘Boy’ tattooed on his arms, told the 19-year-old to roll down his window and punched him in the face as Feigen was talking on his cell phone.

The victim told police Wheeler said he struck him because ‘he forgot the garlic knots.’

Not that dough: Wheeler told police he punched Feigen because the pizzeria owes him money, not because he forgot to deliver garlic knots

The dissatisfied customer then instructed Feigen to ‘give it [the punch] to the person working on the phone back at the restaurant,’ the station WPTV reported.

When officials arrived in Wheeler’s house to question him about the incident, the 48-year-old unemployed man admitted to assaulting the deliveryman, but said that he did not do it over the forgotten garlic knots, but rather because the pizzeria owed him money.

Wheeler has been charged with misdemeanor battery and released from River County Jail on $500 bond.
