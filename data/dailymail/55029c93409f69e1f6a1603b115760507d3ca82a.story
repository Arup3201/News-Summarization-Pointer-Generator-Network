A bridegroom was so impressed with the venue for his lavish wedding reception that he returned in the dead of night and plundered it.

Christopher Richards, 25, enjoyed a luxury champagne buffet with 90 guests following his marriage to Bridie Sparks, 24.

But he later returned to the venue, broke in and stole hundreds of bottles of spirits, wine, beer and alcopops as he went on a £50,000 wrecking spree.

George Taylor, centre left, are pictured at the wedding. Both returned 
to the Bacup Hub club and stole spirits and wine. Bridie Sparks, right, said she will stand by her man

Last night Richards' new wife, a 
mother-of-two who is pregnant with their third child, vowed to stand by 
her new husband saying: 'I love him. Nobody's perfect.'

Burnley Crown Court heard that the couple were married in Bacup and then went to the Bacup Hub for their reception.

Club owner Catherine Murphy, an 
accountant, provided the champagne buffet at half price because 
Richards, a labourer, was unemployed at the time and was broke.

She charged the couple only £1,060  
for the whole day – including venue, champagne, chocolate fountain  and 
bouncy castle – when the usual fee  is £2,400.

But Richards, his usher George  
Taylor, 24, and two other intruders broke into the club six months later
 before smashing CCTVs, mirrors, tiles, cupboards and glasses. They 
stole more than £20,000 worth of goods and caused damage estimated at 
£25,000.

Richards, from Bacup, was arrested 
after CCTV images of the raid were published in a local newspaper. He 
told police officers it was an act of stupidity carried out when he was 
drunk. He admitted burglary and was jailed for six months for what judge
 Jonathan Gibson described as 'a dreadful offence'.

Shocking: This CCTV footage shows the raid taking place at the Bacup Hub. The raid took place despite the venue's owner giving the newly weds a massive discount because they complained of being broke and she felt sorry for them

Vandals: The group caused more than £20,000 of damage to property in the building as well as stealing thousands of pounds worth of alcohol

Yesterday his wife said that although 
memories of her wedding were ruined she would stand by him. 'I can't 
even look at our  wedding photos now,' said Mrs Richards. 'I was going 
to watch  our wedding DVD the other night, but I stopped myself as it 
reminds me of the bad situation we're  in now.

'I'm standing by my man because I love
 him and nobody is perfect. I know my husband isn't an angel and it 
hurts that he went back to the same place we got married.

'I'm now 35 weeks pregnant and I won't even have my husband by my side for the pregnancy.

Ungrateful: Christopher Richards, left, had wed 
Bridie Sparks , right, when he and three friends went back to the club 
where they held the reception to plunder it of thousands of pounds worth
 of alcohol

Happy: The newly-married couple are pictured leaving the church following the wedding

'It makes me so sad he's not going to 
be there. He has been here for all the other pregnancies and is a 
brilliant dad. When I saw the CCTV stills of my husband I just felt 
sick, he looked like a criminal.

'It's affected me badly, with lots of people staring at me in the street, thinking I had something to do with it.'

Mrs Richards already has two children 
with her husband and will give birth to their third while he is in jail.
 'I just hope everything is going to be all right and that we can have 
our fresh start when he gets out,' she said

Disgrace: The owner of the venue laid on a  half price champagne buffet for the couple and their 90 guests because they complained of being broke and she felt sorry for them. Richards is pictured centre with other wedding guests

Worrying: The owner of the Bacup Hub club, which is pictured, said the raid caused her to try and kill herself. It had also had an impact on her staff as well

Theft: This CCTV footage shows the raid taking place in the early hours of the morning. The total cost of the raid in theft and damage was £46,790

On camera: Richards, 25, and his usher helped snatch 62 bottles of spirits from the bar and a further 159 bottles of spirits and cans of soft drinks  from the storeroom

The raid took place in January after 
the couple had been married at the club last July. Owner Miss Murphy, 
34, said the incident had caused her severe stress and anxiety and she 
had attempted suicide.

'I feel ashamed that I trusted them,' 
she said. 'Bridie explained her circumstances, and she got a bit upset 
when I first met her.

'She'd had a bit of bad luck, her 
mother had died when she was younger, but she wanted the wedding of 
every girl's dreams and I helped to bring some community spirit back to 
the area.

'It's shaken my belief in people and I hope I'll be a better judge of character in future.'

Taylor, also of Bacup, pleaded guilty 
to burglary and an unrelated offence of wounding with intent to cause 
grievous bodily harm. He was jailed for five years.
