For a man who is said to despise the US President, North Korean ruler Kim Jong-un appears to be showing a touch of hypocrisy as he steps onto a red carpet from his own version of 'Air Force One'.        

A photo, published in the official North Korean daily newspaper Rodong Sinmun, shows for the first time the luxury Russian IL-62 jetliner that carries Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju on official engagements around the secretive country.

At first glance, the aircraft bears some similarity to the US President's personal jet, bearing as it does North Korea's official name and flag and a star symbolising Kim on its tail, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported today, quoting the North's paper.

On the Tarmac: Kim Jong-Un's plane is greeted by officers from the North Korean military as he arrives for the 2014 combat flight contest. The Russian plane has been converted to a private jet for the use of the dictator.

The American President's jet is a a prominent symbol of the presidency and its power - and it now appears that Kim has decided not to be out-done, ensuring the North's flag and his own seal mirrors the livery of Air Force One.

An official photo shows Kim and his wife walking along a red carpet from the aircraft past a guard of honour with a goose-stepping officer just behind them.

They were arriving for the 2014 combat flight competition at a military facility in the country when the pictures were taken.

Kim is giving the military men a salute as his wife walks slightly behind him, dressed in a green suit after their arrival at an undisclosed air base.

On an earlier occasion two months ago Kim was seen alighting from a jet at Samjyon Airport, but on that occasion it was operated by the official government airline, Air Koryo.

The South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train.

In fact he has even tried his hand at the controls, it was claimed, although he is not known to have an qualifications as a pilot.

'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul.

Kim's wife is presumed to support his preference for flying around North Korea, rather than travelling by road or train - Ri's father is said to have been a pilot.

Meanwhile,
 Chosun Ilbo reported, it emerged from that air base visit that Kim and 
Ri were accompanied by Hwang Pyong-so, the new military politburo chief,
 and Choe Ryong-hae, Hwang's predecsssor, who was in civilian clothes.

This has added to speculation that while Choe has not lost much actual status, he has been demoted to party secretary.

The 
dictator's new travel arrangement show the popularity of private planes. It comes after it was revealed that Tony 
Blair appeared to be footing the bill for the use of a £30million 
private plane.

Tony Blair has reportedly been using a £7,000-an-hour private jet for international travel. He is pictured here on a flight back to London after campaigning in the Scottish elections in Glasgow in 2007

The former prime minister has been seen leaving a £7,000-an-hour
 bespoke aircraft complete with stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed.

Mr
 Blair, 60, is reported to have regularly chartered the top-of-the-range
 Bombardier Global Express private jet as he travels the world in his 
new roles as business consultant and public speaker, according to The 
Sunday Telegraph.

Plans for a presidential-style 'Blair Force One' were rejected as too expensive during his time at Downing Street.
