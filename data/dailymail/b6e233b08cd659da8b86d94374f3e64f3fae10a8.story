A woman left heartbroken by seven miscarriages has finally achieved her dream of becoming a mother - thanks to a stitch in her cervix and daily doses of aspirin.

Samantha Bourner had spent a traumatic 12 years trying to start a family since meeting her husband, David, in 2003.

The 33-year-old initially became pregnant after two years, but was devastated when she lost the baby - whom she had named after her grandfather Alfie - at just 22 weeks.

Over the next decade she suffered another five miscarriages and almost gave up hope of ever having a child.

Samantha Bourner, 33, suffered seven miscarriages and she and her husband David, 35, nearly gave up on ever having a child. On December 3 2014 she gave birth to Noel Arthur Paul - thanks to a stitch in her cervix

Mrs Bourner said Noel had a personality straight away. She said: 'He likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and doesn't like going down in his bed'

She was diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes an increased risk of blood clots and raises the risk of miscarriage in pregnant women.

Doctors said the condition – which causes the blood to be 'too sticky' - could be causing her recurring miscarriages.

They prescribed aspirin, which helps thin the blood, and another drug called Clexane which stops blood clots forming.

Last March Mrs Bourner became pregnant for a seventh time and was delighted when doctors told her she would be having twins.

But she lost one of the babies at just nine weeks, and she and her husband David, 35, feared the other child would not survive.

However, doctors inserted a stitch into her cervix, which stops it opening too early, reducing the chance of a miscarriage.

On December 3 Mrs Bourner gave birth to Noel Arthur Paul four weeks early by emergency Caesarean section.

Mrs Bourner, from Hamstreet, Kent, said: 'It's been a long time coming but nothing prepares you for being a mum.

'It's a lot harder than I thought it would be and I'm always tired.

'But it's really exciting, watching every stage he goes through. Just seeing him every day is amazing.

'I never felt safe during the pregnancy.

'Everyone was getting really excited but right up until the point I was holding him I thought it was going to go wrong.'

Mrs Bourner, who runs a craft company, added: 'Noel had a personality pretty much straight away.

A cervical stitch is also known as a cervical suture or cervical cerclage.

It involves 'stitching' a tape around the cervix to support it.

This aims to keep the cervix closed and therefore to help prevent a baby being born too early.

Doctors might advise a cervical stitch because they believe the woman has a weakness in the cervix – they call this ‘cervical incompetence’. 

This means the cervix runs the risk of opening before the end of a 40-week pregnancy, and maybe even very early on in pregnancy.

If the cervix opens, there is an increased risk of the baby being born early and not surviving, or surviving with a serious risk of long-term problems.

'He likes lots and lots of cuddles and attention and doesn't like going down in his bed.

'He can be fast asleep in your arms and as soon as you put him down he's wide awake. He also loves being in the bath.'

Noel was born at St Mary's Hospital in London weighing 5lb14oz - but Mrs Bourner still had worries right to the last minute.

During her pregnancy, Mrs Bourner had suffered from gestational diabetes – a condition affecting pregnant women where there is too much glucose in the blood - and had to go on a strict low sugar diet.

Then, one morning she woke up to discover she had been bleeding overnight and dialled 999 in tears.

She told the operator she thought she had lost another baby and was rushed to hospital, where doctors performed an emergency Caesarean immediately.

When Noel was born, Mrs Bourner said his first cry sounded 'amazing'.

She believes her son's twin, whom she lost at nine weeks old, may actually have helped Noel to survive.

The twin was absorbed into the womb rather than being miscarried in the normal way, a condition known as a 'vanishing twin' which sometimes occurs when more than one baby develops in the womb.

Mrs Bourner said: 'Noel was always on one side of my tummy to begin with but when his twin died he moved over to where they had been.

'I think he was looking for him or her. The sibling was a vanishing twin, I never miscarried, it was reabsorbed into the womb.

'I believe that second twin meant there were extra hormones from that brief little life to help keep the other going.'

Research suggests that vanishing twin syndrome occurs in roughly a third of pregnancies in which an early ultrasound detects two or more developing babies.

After years of heartbreak, Mrs Bourner and her husband are delighted to be parents. Mrs Bourner said: 'We are over the moon with Noel, he really is a miracle and I adore him.'

While Mrs Bourner says she is thrilled to finally be a mother, she currently has no plans to try for another baby.

'People keep saying now we've done it once we could do it again.

'But I would have to have to have that exact combination of hormones, supplements and diets - and even then it might not happen,' she said.

'It puts a strain on your body and doctors have said it might be dangerous for me to have another child.

'We are over the moon with Noel, he really is a miracle and I adore him.'

Experts say just one per cent of couples suffer three or more miscarriages, so Mrs Bourner's success after seven was remarkable.

Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, said: 'Random miscarriages are horribly common and one in four women will have at least one.

'It is a far smaller group that have one after another, after another. It is only one per cent of couples trying to conceive who will have three or more.'

She added: 'When it happens again and again it becomes really hard to bear - for more than half of those people they will never find out why they are miscarrying.

'Some couples will keep trying and some of them just feel like they need to stop because they can't cope anymore.

'I am really happy to hear Samantha has had success but I'm sure that it won't stop her feeling the grief for the babies that she has lost.'
