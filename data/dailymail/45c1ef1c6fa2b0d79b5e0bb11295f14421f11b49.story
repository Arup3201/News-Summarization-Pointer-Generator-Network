Given the typical undergraduate's love of lie-ins, some might say they get enough sleep already.

But one university is clearly worried its students could do with a little more rest, to the point where it has introduced a designated nap room.

The 'Nap Nook' is based on a sleepy room opened at James Madison University at Harrisonburg, Virginia, in the USA. 

Sleepy students can book a 40 minute nap in the designated room (pictured) at the University of East Anglia

Students will be well catered for with comfy bags and chairs, white noise to block out the busy campus and blackout curtains. 

Eye masks and anti-microbial pillows are also supplied in the room, which is open from noon until 6pm every day. 

Students can simply turn up or reserve a slot in advance for 40 minutes of sleep – monitored by CCTV to make sure they abide by the rules.

Liam McCafferty, postgraduate students officer, said students live in a world of high expectations and volunteering, private study and nights out take their toll.

He said students often live in noisy houses with their friends, with loud corridors, facing busy roads.

And sleep is one thing that can be easily changed.

Liam, 23, of Norwich, said: 'Sleep is one of the biggest factors in a person's life and one of the easiest things to change.

'The nap room will give students a chance to see the benefits.

'We hope the room will help, anything that encourages students to think positively about the benefits of sleep is a good thing.

'Students in particular are prone to bad sleeping habits.'  

The room is open from noon until 6pm each day - but students will be closely monitored to ensure they don't break the rules (picture posed by a model)

Independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley said the 'Nap Nook' was a good idea for hard-working students who had toiled in the library the previous night.

But he warned students should value the importance of sleep and not use the room as an excuse to have a few extra drinks on a night out.

Dr Stanley said: 'From a simple point of view it's a good idea. Drinking energy drinks such as Red Bull is only a temporary boost.

'A short nap can boost your performance by 20 to 25 per cent.

'It would be much better for the university to educate their students about the importance of their sleep.

'If the students are needing the nap room because they are working hard then I am 100 per cent for that.'
