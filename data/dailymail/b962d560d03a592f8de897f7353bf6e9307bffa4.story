Bernard Hopkins must overcome the formidable challenge of knockout artist Sergey Kovalev if he is to reign as world champion at the remarkable age of 50.

Hopkins, who holds the IBF and WBA light heavyweight titles, will need to defy Father Time once again when he takes on the WBO champion in November.

Kovalev won his title with a brutal destruction of Nathan Cleverly last year and the Russian made his third successful defence against Blake Caparello last Saturday.

Tricky: Bernard Hopkins must overcome knockout artist Sergey Kovalev if he is to reign as world champion

Old timer: Hopkins holds the IBF and WBA light heavyweight titles and takes on the WBO champion in November

Hopkins, who
 will reach his half century in January and is the oldest ever world 
champion, said: 'Everything I do at this point in my career affects my 
legacy. I've set and broken many records, but becoming the oldest 
undisputed light heavyweight world champion is the goal and Kovalev 
stands in the way of that goal.

'He's another young, hungry fighter and just like the ones that came before him, he will leave the ring beltless.' 

Hopkins has never been stopped in his six defeats but Kovalev has been taken the distance just twice in 25 fights.

The 31-year-old said: 'I respect Bernard Hopkins for taking this fight. I came to America, it was dream to fight the best and now I am fighting, I have my chance.

'He says he is alien. He punch, I punch, then we see who is gonna go to Mars.' 

No problem: Kovalev (black trunks) walks away after knocking Blake Caparello in Atlantic City on Saturday
