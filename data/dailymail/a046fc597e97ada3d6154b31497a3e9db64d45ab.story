At least five national TV journalists have met in private with the police officer responsible for the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August.

Officer Darren Wilson hasn't been seen in public - let alone interviewed - since the shooting, but he has met with the high profile television anchors to discuss the possibility of doing a televised interview at some point.

While a grand jury continues to deliberate over whether to charge Wilson for shooting Brown, the officer is believed to have met with anchors including NBC’s Matt Lauer, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, CBS’ Scott Pelley and CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon.

NBC's Matt Lauer and CNN's Anderson Cooper are among a couple of five high profile TV anchors who have spoken in secret with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson

Within hours of his name being linked with having secret meetings with Darren Ferguson, Anderson Cooper tweeted to confirm that it had happened and was standard procedure 

Wilson’s low profile since the shooting means every media organization covering the high profile story is very eager to speak to him.

Speaking on his CNN Sunday morning show Reliable Sources, host Brian Stelter revealed that the five anchors had all had off-the-record conversations with the police officer and that his list was not exhaustive.

‘My sense from my sources is that it’s mostly the anchors doing the talking in these off-the-record meetings, it’s mostly Darren Wilson listening and getting to know the person, said Stelter.

Soon after the program aired on Sunday, both Cooper and Lemon confirmed via Twitter that the meetings had taken place.

Both were keen to explain that such meetings are a normal part of the TV guest booking process in order to establish trust and comfort with the potential interviewee.

‘For the record, I met briefly with Darren Wilson a few days ago to see if he wanted to do an interview with me. That's standard procedure,’ Cooper wrote.

CNN host Don Lemon also tweeted to confirm that he had met with Darren Wilson to sound him out for a possible exclusive TV interview

Cooper denied that meeting Ferguson cop Wilson was part of any conspiracy and said it was standard practice to meet with a possible interview subject prior to them agreeing to speak on camera

Cooper denied that his meeting with Wilson was part of a pro-police conspiratorially and pointed out that he'd repeatedly interviewed Michael Brown's family members and their attorneys.

'I'd also like to interview the grand jury,' Cooper wrote. 'There is no conspiracy here. Reporters want to interview people and sometimes you have to meet them first.'

He added that Wilson had chosen 'not to do an interview with me.' 

Cooper, on Twitter, drew a comparison to another man in the news that many journalists wanted to interview earlier this year: disgraced Los Angeles Clippers team owner Donald Sterling.

'Prior to interviewing Donald Sterling, for example, I also met with him to ask him to do an interview. That's how you ask for an interview,' Cooper wrote.

Separately, Lemon wrote on Twitter that his meeting with Wilson was 'not out of the ordinary,' and that 'We've interviewed the Brown family, Dorian Johnson and all witnesses. Of course we'd want to interview Wilson.'

After a fourth straight night of low-level protests in Ferguson, Missouri, anxious residents still did not know on Sunday when a grand jury would return its decision. 

The 12-member grand jury adjourned and was to resume meeting behind closed doors on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing an unidentified St. Louis County official.

Preaching at the Greater St Mark Family Church, the Rev. Tommie Pierson urged the congregation to pull together as a community. 

'The power to get what you need is already in our hands,' he said. 'You live in a democracy; you must participate.'

Looking heavenward, Pierson said: 'You alone know what the grand jury will do. You alone know what the marchers and demonstrators will do. We ask, oh God, for your protection.'

Reports had suggested the 12-member grand jury panel would have a decision by this weekend. There have been nightly rallies and a high-profile law enforcement presence.

A lawyer for Michael Brown's family criticized how prosecutors have handled the grand jury process, which has dragged on longer than many expected.

The attorney, Benjamin Crump, told ABC's This Week program on Sunday it was the first time in his 20 years as an attorney that a prosecutor had not recommended charges to a grand jury hearing a case.

'Why you can't come in and recommend charges right now based on the probable cause?' Crump said, a reference to witnesses who said Brown had his hands up in the air, signaling surrender, when the officer shot him. Wilson's supporters say he shot Brown in self-defense.

St. Louis County prosecutors have said the grand jury's decision will be announced at a news conference, but the date, time and location remain unknown. 

Crump said he expected to get about six hours notice before an announcement.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and called in National Guard troops to back up police, which protesters have criticized as heavy-handed

In anticipation of the announcement, barriers were erected over the weekend around the courthouse where the jury meets, and traffic restrictions were imposed on some nearby roads. 

The streets were largely empty of people on Sunday during torrential rain.

Two people were arrested outside Ferguson police headquarters late Saturday - an activist from Chicago who has been detained during protests three times since Wednesday and a man identified as a Washington, D.C. based-reporter.

Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told demonstrators on Saturday night they should remain peaceful whatever the grand jury decides.
