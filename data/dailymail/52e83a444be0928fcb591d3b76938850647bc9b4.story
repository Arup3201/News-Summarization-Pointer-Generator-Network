Gwen Trickett with her 56-year-old Hoover Junior vacuum cleaner which she still uses to this day

Pensioner Gwen Trickett has cleaned up with the ancient vacuum cleaner she bought bought for a few pounds more than half a century ago.

Her blue and grey upright Hoover Junior is still going strong and has never let her down even after vacuuming her carpets thousands of times over the years.

Mrs Trickett, 77, bought a new plastic cleaner ten years ago but used it just once and dumped it in a corner before returning to trusty Hoover Junior.

It was the first household item that 
great grandmother Mrs Trickett and husband Derek, from Worsborough, 
Barnsley, bought when they were married in 1957.

And
apart from replacing the wire flex she has had to buy just one new bag,
while the ancient motor continues to power the Hoover on her twice 
weekly cleaning sessions.

The Hoover Junior would have cost Mrs Trickett £20 in the mid 1950s which was twice the average weekly wage at the time.

‘I must admit I like to get my wear 
out of things but I never thought it would last as long as this,' said 
Mrs Trickett, who celebrates her 56th wedding anniversary today.

‘We
bought it from a local shop with back tax which was the income tax you 
got back if you were married before the end of the tax year.

‘I
can't remember exactly how much we paid for it but there is not doubt 
we have had our moneysworth out of it and a lot more besides.

‘It's
had a few knocks over the years and the paintwork is scratched but it's
a metal body so it's solid. About ten years ago I bought a new plastic 
cleaner because I thought that my Hoover was bound to break down at any 
time but it never has.

‘It 
starts up every time and still has a lot of suction. My other cleaner 
just stands in the corner and is no where near as good.

The Hoover Junior was the first household item bought by Gwen Trickett after she married her husband Derek

Reliable: The 56-year-old hoover's paintwork is scratched but it still has a lot of suction according to Gwen Trickett

‘I wouldn't replace it for one of these new-fangled cleaners you see on TV that are like a rolling ball with a tube attached.

‘I have a son and a daughter, my 
daughter is a bit like me and will get her wear out of things but my son
falls apart laughing because the cleaner is ancient and he thinks I 
ought to use the other one.’

Gwen added: ‘I hope I've got a few years left yet but I bet my Hoover will still be going when I'm gone.’
