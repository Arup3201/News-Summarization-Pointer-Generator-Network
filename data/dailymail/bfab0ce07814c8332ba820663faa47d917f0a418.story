It turns out that bowl of ice cream or packet of crisps could be good for you after all. 

New research on successful slimmers shows that indulging in unhealthy treats while on a diet makes you more likely to reach your goal weight. 

The findings put to rest the myth that a diet of nuts and lettuce will get your into those skinny jeans quicker than a balanced diet.

A new survey shows that indulging in unhealthy treats while on a diet makes you more likely to reach your goal weight (posed by model) 

In a survey of 2,600 Weight Watchers members, over half of whom have lost 10 per cent of their body weight, three quarters planned indulgence into their week. 

A third of all respondents went even further, revealing they treated themselves to unhealthy food at least once a day. 

94 per cent of those questioned thought they were more likely to lose weight by incorporating indulgence into their plans as it helps to stay focused on the end goal - one in five said they’ve found they actually lose more weight on weeks when they include their favourite foods,

And the proof was in the (lack of) pudding - when questioned, half of the respondents who don’t let themselves indulge admitted they had gained a stone or more after a diet that involved deprivation.

Only a quarter of people who had tried this method of only-healthy dieting managed to stick with the rigorous regime for more than a month. 

Zoe Griffiths, Head of Programme and Public Health for Weight Watchers UK said: 'The common misconception is that you need to deprive yourself of the food you love, in order to see weight loss success.

'But the reality is, as soon as you tell yourself that you can’t have that glass of wine in the evening or a dessert after dinner, you start to want it even more. 

'This explains why so many respondents only lasted a short amount of time on a ‘deprivation’ diet, it’s unsustainable.

“At Weight Watchers we know that life just isn’t fun when you deprive yourself of the foods you love and, in actual fact, allowing yourself to indulge as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle is much more effective.'
