I couldn’t believe my luck when I was recently asked to be on the cover of Square Mile magazine.

For anyone who hasn’t worked in the city, the luxury monthly mag is the GQ for all the city boys (and girls) – it’s all about the movers and shakers of the financial world as well as all things fashion, styling, and dining.

So it came as a bit of shock to be asked to appear on the cover, as well as a great privilege – the previous cover star was Leo DiCaprio for his Wolf of Wall Street launch, so clearly they must have had a quiet month in order to choose me for the March issue.

Spencer says that he struggled to juggle his career in finance with filming Made in Chelsea

There was of course a tenuous link for me to their world of finance - I was a trader in the city for quite a few years before I started filming for Made In Chelsea.

Many city firms have first day initiations for their new apprentices to go through and Square Mile editor Mark Hedley made me reveal mine.

I was pretty much the only posh bloke in a room full of Essex wide-boys. There were four guys starting on the same day and we were made to undertake a gruelling lunch challenge.

It was four Big Macs, four large chocolate muffins, four cans of lager, and one conference room. We were all sat down in from of this haul of food and drink and the whole office put money in a jar and bet on who could consume the lot in the fastest time.

Before filming Made in Chelsea, Spencer used to turn up at his desk job at 5:45am every morning

Only one guy in a office of about a hundred people bet on me.

My
 plan for the City Boy vs Food challenge was to go slow and steady, I 
figured that anyone who flew out of the traps too quickly would suffer 
difficulty later down the line.

And
 that’s exactly what happened, one took the lead very quickly but then 
went green and had to retire from the race. The other two raced ahead 
but I caught them both up in the final lap and managed the lot in under 
25 minutes.

I realise that it was a totally juvenile and stupid game but you might as well win it if you can. So the prize pot was left to me and the only guy who backed me, Max Keble-White, who is still a good friend to this day.

(BTW - I would not advise anyone to attempt to beat this record at home, it’s not big or clever.)

For a time I was trying to juggle a job in the city and filming Made In Chelsea, I was at my desk at work for 5.45am (the hours are definitely the worst thing about working in the city) finished at 6pm then onto a taxi-bike across town to Chelsea to film for the show till about 11pm.

Inevitably there would be a few drinks
 afterwards and what with weekend shoots and quite a bit of partying, I 
found myself burnt out and also quite overweight – watch series 1 and 2 
of MIC and it’s hard to miss.

The
 constant snacking at work was the worst thing but I’ve now got that 
under control by using Forza T5 Super Strength in the mornings and 
afternoons.

Spencer Matthews says he plans to work on his fitness levels in order to be beach ready this summer

I also get deliveries from Fresh Fitness Food right to my door every day which gives me nutritious low carb meals, and I’m working out a lot at City Athletic gym with my trainer, WBFF Pro Fitness world champion Shaun Stafford.

I totally admit I’ve let myself slip a bit since getting in Men’s Health cover shape at the end of last year so I’m making a big push to be beach ready for summer now and I’m planning a trip to No 1 Boot Camp in Ibiza to take off any rough edges.

One thing I certainly won’t be doing is having four Big Macs for lunch any time soon.
