Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England 

If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop 

True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce

Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016

I'm surprised how much Roy Keane’s second autobiography made me laugh. And who knew he would let his daily horoscope decide his career path?

More importantly the book told me that Keane should be the next Manchester United manager.

The more I read what he had to say, and his reflections on his two jobs as a boss, the more I realised how perfect he would be at Old Trafford.

Ryan Giggs may be a legend at United, but learning how to manage on the job is not what you should be doing at a club like that.

If Giggs takes over it means United are giving that massive job to a rookie. Any appointment is a gamble, but that’s one they don’t need to risk.

Keane has the United history.

He understands the club.

He understands how top players work.

He can deal with the expectations.

Crucially, Keane has learned his trade elsewhere and I don’t think he gets enough credit for the brilliant job he did at Sunderland. He took over a club that was in turmoil, losing games and potentially dropping into the third tier of English football. 

He turned them into a winning machine in a short space of time and took them up as champions.

The next season he kept them in the Premier League. Then after a ridiculous disagreement with the owner Ellis Short, Keane and Sunderland parted company.

It was a bizarre end to his successful time there.

Keane's new autobiography The Second Half has grabbed a lot of headlines over the past week

Keane walked into a club with huge expectations, at a very low ebb and turned them around.

He admits his mistakes, and even better he learned from them.

His time at Ipswich wasn’t good at all – but then not many managers in the last 10 years have done anything at that club. The massive lesson he learned there was communication, with the owner and others running the club.

Because that communication failed, Ipswich ended up paying massively over the top transfer fees for players. They really did pay £1.7million for Tamas Priskin. Incredible.

Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson fell out towards the end of his time at Old Trafford

Keane's next job at Ipswich was tougher - but no manager has had success there in the last decade 

That’s a lesson learned that he can take into his next job – managing upwards at a club, dealing with the board, the chairman and the chief executive.

I like how he accepts criticism for some of his decisions – like selling goalscorer Jordan Rhodes when he was at Portman Road. A man who takes the blame is a man who’s on top of his ego.

He’s now getting experience as an assistant at Premier League and international level.

Is he on top of his anger? Probably not totally, but he might need a bit of that to deal with issues at a big club like United. He had a player turning up late regularly at Sunderland, and when Keane dropped him as punishment, the player’s agent phoned to make the excuse that the player lived on a busy junction. 

Keane was always a fierce leader on the pitch during his years as Manchester United captain

Keane won seven Premier League titles and four FA Cups in his time at Old Trafford

If you were Keane, you’d be angry.

Is he in control of his inner chimp? Well Keane says in his autobiography he tried to read the book The Chimp Paradox by the sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. But he admitted he couldn’t get through it – his inner chimp wouldn’t let him.

Keane is made to be manager of Manchester United. When Louis van Gaal’s work is done, the time will be right for the Irishman to be welcomed back to Old Trafford.
