Rio Ferdinand has ruled out becoming the FA's candidate for British vice-president on FIFA's executive next year.

Sports Agenda revealed last month that the 35-year-old was in the FA's thoughts for a position which would have made him the first playing member of world football’s most important committee.

But Ferdinand has insisted that now is not the time, although he did not rule out taking up the position at some point in the future.

Ferdinand told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: 'Sepp’s not called me yet, so I don’t think now’s the time.

'All my eggs are in one basket with playing for QPR and trying to stay in the Premier League. Who knows in the future?'

'I’d have the conversation, definitely.'

The role will became vacant next year when Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce, who took on the role in 2011, steps down.
