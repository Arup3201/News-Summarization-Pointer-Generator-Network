It is said that behind every great man is a great woman, and there is at least one famous husband who truly believes it.

Julian Fellowes, the Oscar-winning creator of Downton Abbey and Gosford Park, says the secret to his success is his wife, Lady Emma Kitchener, who cured him of his insecurities and allowed his career to flourish.

Speaking to The Lady magazine, Fellowes explained that marriage gave him the smell of confidence:'The great change in my professional life
was sealed by my marriage. It gave me a basis that I had 
lacked before. I smelt different.'

lacked before'

Lady Emma Kitchener, niece of the third Earl Kitchener and a former lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent, allowed Fellowes to let go of the self-doubt baggage he had carried since he was a boy.

Speaking about his elder brother Rory, Fellowes - whose full title is Lord Fellowes of West Stafford - said: 'He was frightfully handsome and looked very like Terence Stamp. I was very conscious of not being attractive.'

When he returned to Britain from 
America in 1983 - where he had been trying his luck as an actor in 
Hollywood - Fellowes remembers feeling panicked that his career was 
floundering.

But when he 
meet Lady Kitchener at a party in 1989 (and pursued her relentlessly 
until she agreed to marry him a year later) his luck completely changed.

His
new-found self-esteem led Fellowes not only to better acting roles, but
also to greater belief in the strength of his own writing. After 20 
scripts he produced Gosford Park, for which he won the Oscar in 2002.

After that, his previously rejected novel Snobs was published in 2004, becoming a bestseller.

His screenplay for The Young Victoria was made into a film in 2009, starring Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. Downton Abbey will 
launch its fourth series on ITV next month.
