A NCAA basketball star held court on Wednesday - but not for his ball handling skills.

Nigel Hayes, 20, a sophomore forward for the Wisconsin Badgers, confidentially sat down to attend a televised press conference at the Staples Center in Los Angeles with two fellow players.

But failing to realize the microphone was still running, the 6ft 7in sportsman loudly whispered to his teammate 'God she's beautiful' after spotting 43-year-old Debra Bollman - a stenographer for ASAP Sports - in the crowd.

Did you hear that? As the audience started to snigger, Hayes quickly realized he'd been heard

As the audience started to snigger, Hayes quickly realized he'd been heard.

'Did you hear that?' he quipped to the crowd before cradling his head in his hands.

'Alright we'll open it up to questions!' the announcer then said through laughter, in a bid to move things on. 

Bollman, who is from Riverside, California, has apparently been approached by media outlets after being singled out by Hayes.

Indeed, the brunette's daughter Sophia, who is a singer, tweeted: 'I've been working to get out there for years and my mom gets called beautiful by a basketball player and Extra is calling... like what?'

Red-faced: Hayes  cradled his head in his hands in embarrassment 

Joker: Hayes, who grew up in Toledo, Ohio, has caused quite a raucous on the microphone recently, testing stenographers with trick words such as 'cattywampus', 'antidisestablishmentarianism' and 'soliloquy' 

When she's not writing up sports news, Bollman works as a real estate agent. 

It appears the blunder has also expanded Hayes'  fanbase.

Many commenters have deemed his slip-up 'cute' and 'endearing'.

On Wednesday before his error, he served up the word 'syzygy' for good measure. 

Hayes and the rest of the Badgers will go head-to-head with the North Carolina Tar Heels in the Sweet Sixteen on Thursday night.
