Hunt: Wayne Morgan, 37, has been living in the woods Rambo-style for the past five years, scavenging food to survive

A 'wolfman' who has been living wild in a forest for the past five years, surviving on rabbits, plants and berries, is at the centre of a police hunt.

Wayne Morgan, 37, has been using survival skills honed in the army as he sleeps rough - but police fear he could freeze to death in the cold weather.

The elusive man, who has a thick beard, disappeared into the forest in Pantyffynon Woods, near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, in 2007.

He is occasionally spotted by ramblers through the trees - but has not been seen for over a year.

Locals call him 'The Wolfman' and have blamed him for a series of thefts of milk from their doorsteps.

Police have previously tried to track down Mr Morgan - described as a real-life 
Rambo - after it emerged he had 
turned to petty crime to survive.

Sniffer dogs and a helicopter with heat-seeking equipment were brought in to trace him, but police believe he knows the woodland 
so well he was able to lie low. They found abandoned 
hideouts and evidence that he had lit fires to cook meals.

Now, after the record low temperatures and a lack of sightings police say they are 'very concerned' for his safety.

Sergeant Theresa Ross, of Dyfed Powys Police, 
said: 'We have been aware of a man known locally as Wolfman living in woods for a number of years.

'Anyone walking in the wooded area 
who may have seen this man should get in contact with us to let us know 
when any sightings took place.'

'He is not known to claim benefits of be registered with any 
agency so he may be hungry and on the look-out for food.

'If you are suspicious that any food items are missing from your stores then please contact us.'

Mr Morgan is thought to get some of his meals from supermarket bins as well as scavenging anything he can find from the woodland.

Local councillor Hugh Evans said: 'He 
is a bit of a Rambo type and pretty tough to have survived the bitterly 
cold winter living out in the open.

'The area where he is living is thickly-wooded and forested - the sort of area where it is easy to disappear.'

Debris: This is thought to be a camp used by Wayne Morgan who was taught survival skills in the armed forces. There are growing fears for him as he has not been spotted for a year
