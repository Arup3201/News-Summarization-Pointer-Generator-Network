A US man who is on a federal aviation watch list was asked to undergo additional screening after his flight landed because security officers apparently failed to carry out the necessary checks before he boarded the plane.

The flight carrying Kahler Nygard was already in the sky by the time Transportation Security Administration officials realised the error.

The 22-year-old was once on a ‘no-fly list’ but is now on a ‘selectee list’ that calls for a more rigorous screening process than usual before boarding.

But Kahler insists the appropriate screening was completed before he boarded the Spirit Airlines flight in Minneapolis and claims the TSA’s attempt to do an additional check was harassment.

Kahler, from Orono, Minnesota, and a friend documented his experience in a series of mobile phone videos that have been posted online.

When the flight landed in Denver earlier this month, Kahler was asked to disembark before all other passengers and submit himself to a secondary search.

One of the videos shows him in the terminal at Denver International Airport, where he was greeted by a group of TSA officers who asked him to step into a private area so they could ‘screen your body and your bags’.

In the video, Kahler refuses to co-operate and questions why the search is required and whether he is being detained. The TSA does not have the authority to detain passengers.

The officer, who is wearing latex gloves, tells him: ‘We need to do some screening that may or may not have been completed in Minneapolis.’

When Kahler asks the officer why the screening has to be done after his flight landed, he is told: 'Because it wasn't completed in Minneapolis.'

But Kahler refuses to accompany him as the argument goes back and forth: ‘If I travelled from point A to point B safely why does there now need to be more screening before I am allowed to leave? That would lead to me believe that I am being detained would it not? Are you detaining me?’

Kahler decides to walk away after the officer informs him he is not being detained but that he would be apprehended by Denver police if he doesn’t agree to the search.

He later flew back to Minneapolis without any trouble.

Another video shows him exiting the plane in Denver in front of confused passengers.

He tells the camera: 'I’m the only one walking off the airplane right now, so this is really interesting.

'They let me fly all the way to Denver so here I am. Look at everybody here, they’re wondering what’s going on with this guy. No, I have not committed a crime.’

A third video, recorded by a friend, purports to show Kahler being patted down by a security officer at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport before he boarded the flight to Denver.

Passengers who are on the ‘selectee list’ receive a boarding pass with four bold S’s printed on it.

That alerts security officers that more rigorous screening, including a physical patdown and a bag check, is required.

But reports by Fox affiliate KMSP-TV in Minneapolis and NBC affiliate KUSA in Denver suggest that the extra screening did not occur.

A Spirit Airlines spokesperson told KMSP-TV that the flagged boarding pass was noticed by an airline employee who contacted the TSA.

The TSA told MailOnline Travel that it is reviewing the incident and 'all passengers are thoroughly screened before boarding a commercial aircraft.’

Kahler told KUSA he found out three years ago he was on the US government’s ‘no-fly list’ but no one would tell him why.

He insisted he has no connection to terrorism and has suggested that he landed himself in trouble with comments he previously posted on a political website used by people who consider themselves ‘sovereign citizens’.

Three years ago he was turned away and detained when he attempted to board a flight from Colorado to Minnesota.

MailOnline has contacted the TSA, Spirit Airlines and Denver Police Department for comment.
