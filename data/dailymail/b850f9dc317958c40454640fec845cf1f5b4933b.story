Vahid Halilhodzic is strong favourite to become Japan's new national team manager and could take charge before friendly matches with Tunisia and Uzbekistan later this month.

The Japan Football Association want their new coach installed and up to speed before the World Cup qualifying campaign gets underway in June.

Mexican Javier Aguirre was sacked last month amid fears his alleged involvement in a match-fixing case in Spain could hurt the team.

Japan's Kyodo News quoted JFA President Kuniya Daini as saying he expected the Bosnian to sign his contract by March 12.

Japan have friendly matches scheduled against Tunisia on March 27 and Uzbekistan four days later.

Halilhodzic, 62, has extensive club management experience, including stints in France with Lille, Rennes and Paris Saint-Germain.

On the international front, he was at the helm during Ivory Coast's unbeaten run through 2010 World Cup qualifying, and coached surprise package Algeria at the 2014 Cup in Brazil.

Michael Laudrup had also been linked with the Japan job but his contract with Qatar club Lekhwiya runs until July.
