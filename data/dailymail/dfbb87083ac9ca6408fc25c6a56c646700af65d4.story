A kind family who gave a stranger a lift and some money have been left devastated after the same man returned the following day and vandalized their home.

Robert Boren, his 14-year-old daughter Olivia and his wife saw Derek Deshon Stephens, 24, walking up his street in Oklahoma City and offered him some tinned food and extra money because he said he was starving. 

However, just 24 hours after the act of kindness, Stephens arrived at his doorstep apparently under the influence  demanding his car keys, more money and a gun.

Samritan: Robert Boren and his 14-year-old daughter Olivia saw Derek Deshon Stephens, 24, walking up his street in Oklahoma City and offered him so tinned food and money so he could eat

When Mr Boren refused and told him to leave, the suspect kicked over two 150-pound Christmas Decorations on their porch and used the pieces to break three windows.

A father and son heard the commotion, so came running down the street with a golf club and baseball bat to chase the subject away. 

Stephens then tried to climb their back gate, but eventually fled. 

Mr Boren has described how the confrontation terrified him and his family while the rest of the neighborhood are also rattled.

He told News 9: 'He asked me if he could have some tin cans that were out on the front in a bag to be given away.

'And then he said well, then can I have something to eat, I'm starving. So I gave him some money to eat on.'

Shocking: Just 24 hours after the act of kindness, Stephens arrived at the doorstep of the family home, apparently under the influence, demanding his car keys, more money and a gun

Repsonse: When Mr Boren refused, Stephens reacted angrily sreaming 'let me in' while kicking over Christmas decorations on their porch

Vandalism: Stephens then used some of the broken pieces from the items to break the windows at the front of the property 

Scared: Olivia, Mr Boren's 14-year-old daughter, was in the family's SUV when they picked Stephens up for the first time and thought he was a 'nice man'

Mr Boren then gave Mr Stephens $10 so he left, but a short time later he returned and asked if he could have ride. 

'And I said, "No, I can't go that far. We're late to where we're going",' Boredn added. 'Then he said, "Can you just take me up the street?''

Mr Boren therefore let the man inside his SUV and drove him a couple of blocks. 

The next day around 2pm, the Borens said Derek showed up again, but appeared to be under the influence.

'I was just doing him a favor,' said Boren.

'He seemed nice,' said Robert's 14-year-old daughter, Olivia. 'I was just thinking, what am I going to do if he gets in here. Is he going to hurt everybody? Like what is going to happen? I was scared.'

Mr Boren added: 'I think that I was not very smart in giving him any money, or giving him a ride. But I was trying to do what I thought would be the good thing to do.'

Stephens was arrested and is now in custody under a $10,000 bond.
