Controversial: The 40 Group of MPs argue that a misunderstanding about the benefits system is encouraging some teenagers to have children (file picture)

Teenage mothers should lose their benefits if they refuse to live at home with their parents, a group of Tory MPs warned today.

David Cameron is urged to introduce tough sanctions on young women to stop the welfare system ‘encouraging them to have a child’.

The 40 Group of MPs most at risk of losing their seats at the next election said benefits for teenage mothers should only be paid if they live at home or in special hostels.

In a new book the MPs set out a raft of ideas for future Tory policy, including cutting child benefit for parents whose children repeatedly play truant, curbing wind farms and capping the number of non-EU foreign students entering the UK.

The group hopes to broaden the appeal of the party, particularly in the north of England.

In a foreward to the book, Mr Cameron says the ideas are 'interesting' and 'valuable'.

But the Prime Minister added that party members would have 'inevitably different views' about them.

The most controversial idea is the proposal to force teenagers with babies to live with their parents.

The MPs claim that perceptions of the welfare state mean some young people to think wrongly think that if they get pregnant they will be entitled to free housing.

This is ‘encouraging them to have a child’, the MPs argue.

According to the BBC, the MPs suggest ‘all benefits to teenage mothers should be made on the condition of them living with their parents or in supervised hostel accommodation’.

Interesting: The ideas have been sent to David Cameron, who today met the President of Burma Thein Sein, in Downing Street

Tory MP James Morris, a member of the 
40 Group, admitted the idea was ‘controversial but insisted tougher 
action was needed to tackle the welfare state.

He told the BBC: ‘I know this is a controversial idea, but it’s one of the ideas that is floated in the book.

‘There
has been a lot of progress made on teenage pregnancy over the last few 
years; we still have high rates in comparison with our European 
partners, so I think it’s one thing that the Government should be 
looking at and the Conservative party should be looking at  as we look 
forward to further welfare reform.’

Controversial: Tory MP James Morris said tackling welfare had to be a priority for the future

The 40 Group has been formed of the 40 MPs with the slimmest majorities, who could be most vulnerable at the next election.

Mr Morris said in these crucial swing seats welfare reform is one of the top priorities.

‘It’s way up there as a priority and people are very concerned about benefits and the welfare system.

‘And the book we’ve published today is a book which is 40 ideas across the 40 most marginal seats across the country.

‘Welfare reform does form part of it and I think we can be pushing harder on looking at issues around teenage pregnancy, but the book is actually much broader than that. It has ideas around how to improve the health service and tackling the growing problems of mental health and mental illness.  So it’s a pretty mainstream book in terms of its ideas.'
