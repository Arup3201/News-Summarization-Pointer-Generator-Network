Islamic extremists have hacked the websites of a primary school and a church and replaced their homepages with a hate message against the US and Israel.

A group calling itself X-saad hijacked the sites of Sowerby Community Primary School and the Danish Church of Hull, both in Yorkshire, and replaced them with a sinister Islamic-State style page.

Police have launched an investigation into the hacks that were believed to have taken place late last night.

The sinister message that appeared on the sites of Sowerby Primary School and the Danish Church of Hull

The message that appeared on both websites included a picture of the US and Israeli flag  with a red cross through it.

It is on a black background, similar to an ISIS flag, with English writing in red and Arabic script in white.

The statement reads: 'We Hackers We defend our religion, we do not forget we are without limits we do not believe in the laws'

'Islam is not a terrorist religion but Islam is the religion of coexistence and mercy and love, the real terrorists are Israel and america' 

Sowerby Community Primary School governor Charles Allen said: 'As a Community Governor I have been asked by Jean Yendall, Head Teacher, to post the following to inform and reassure parents.

'The school is aware the website has been hacked and will get the message taken down as soon as possible.

'The school has been in dialogue with North Yorkshire Police. There is no need for anyone to contact the police any further.

'The school and police believe it is perfectly safe to send your child / children to school today.'

Sowerby Community Primary School, near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, was targeted by Islamic hackers overnight

The school near Thirsk, North Yorkshire has  taken the message down from its website and replaced with one saying it was 'currently down for maintenance'.

Torben Jorgenson, pastor at the Danish Church in Hull was left shocked and angry after being alerted to the message.

'It is like a thief coming into your home when they are not invited,' he said. 

'I am angry. We do not want our website to be used to promote this radical and political message. Our website is a friendly one and is used to post information about our social and cultural events.

'It is very shocking.' 

The church is currently liaising with their websites creator to have the message removed. 

The same group are also believed to be responsible for hacking a church website in Australia.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed they were investigating and said the hack of the school's website and believed a number of sites had fallen victim to the virus. 

The force wrote on Twitter last night: 'We are aware that a primary school near Thirsk has had its website hacked. Officers are working with staff to establish the circumstances.'

Inspector Chris Galley, of North Yorkshire Police, said today: 'We believe that the Sowerby Primary School website had unauthorised content posted by a virus which seeks out servers with weak security software.

'Other organisations and businesses both locally, nationally and internationally have had their websites compromised in a similar manner in recent months and there is no suggestion that Sowerby Primary School was deliberately targeted in any way.

'The school have now removed their website and enquiries to establish the origin of the content are ongoing.

'It is important that all organisations with a public facing website ensure that they have sound security software in place to reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring.'

Sowerby Primary School sent out a message reassuring parents last night that this was not a specifically targeted threat and that there was no risk to children attending school. 

Both governors and police officers attended the school this morning as a reassurance to families.

Pete Dwyer, North Yorkshire's Corporate Director of the Children and Young People's Service said: 'We have been working closely with the police on this matter. Our schools place great importance on website security but we understand that despite all best efforts public and corporate websites can be compromised in this way from time to time.

'We are reassured by the police in this case that this was a random breach and that children are not at any risk.'

However, one mother decided to keep her children off school today after being left frightened by the hack.

'I only briefly looked at the website at my friend's house over the road but as soon as I saw the flag at the top I immediately thought it was some terror related thing,' said the 31-year-old parent, who declined to be named.

'I didn't read the message.

'I think my main fear was of the unknown, you didn't know what it was and you wanted to be sure to be safe.

'I didn't know if it was a prank and I didn't know if it was a terror thing.'

Last week Muslim extremists hacked into the Bristol bus timetable after mistaking it for a major international travel website for Europe and the United States.

On this occasion bus and train timetables were replaced with Arabic text and the message: 'Hacked by Darkshadow'.
