Adam Gemili roared with wide-eyed delight as the clock at Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium showed he had become European 200 metres champion in 19.98 seconds, making him the first Briton in history to legally break 20 seconds on two occasions.

Take into account a track dampened by sporadic torrential downpours here yesterday and a 1.6m-per-second headwind and it becomes apparent how much more the 20-year-old has to offer.

A prominent athletics statistician suggested it would be worth 19.90 in still conditions and 19.82 with a 1.6mps tailwind.

The British record of 19.87 set by John Regis when Gemili was less than a year old will surely not stand for long.

‘I’m so happy to be European champion, it was a big target for me,’ Gemili said. ‘It’s really cold and late but I saved my energy from the rounds and to run sub-20 is great.

‘It’s also really nice to beat Christophe Lemaitre. It’s a great feeling and the Brits now have the 100m and 200m title here. I’ll be singing my heart out on the podium. Athletics is so much fun and it’s an honour to be here.’

Gemili ran an almost perfect race, exploding out of the blocks and accelerating round the bend. He remained strong down the home straight, leaving France’s Lemaitre, a 19.80 runner at his best, to scrap it out for silver.

As well as enhancing his reputation on the track, Gemili proved he is a gentleman off it when a woman in the crowd asked for his race number as a souvenir. He dutifully got an official to unpin the sheet on his back and hand it over.

In the men’s 400m final the teacher gave a lesson to the pupil as Martyn Rooney, a veteran of the British team despite only being 27, beat prodigious teenager Matt Hudson-Smith as Britain claimed a one-two.

Rooney has been offering advice and ‘having a laugh in the call room’ with the 19-year-old as they advanced through the rounds. But all friendly feeling was left in the blocks as he held on to win gold in 44.71, the fastest time in Europe this year.

Hudson-Smith finished strongly but did not have enough track left to overhaul Rooney, taking silver in a personal best of 44.75. The two warmly embraced on the finish line and did a lap of honour together. 

Hudson-Smith, from Birmingham, was formerly a 100m sprinter and only properly turned to one-lap running at the start of the year. He has since shaved an incredible one minute off his personal best.

This was Britain’s first one-two in the 400m at the Europeans since Du’ane Ladejo beat Roger Black in 1994.

‘He’s a fantastic kid,’ said Rooney. ‘We were a little bit more subdued before the final but still having fun. From a selfish point of view I’m glad he’s around because I think he’s going to push me to run fast.’

Rooney was also 19 when he came to prominence by breaking Roger Black’s 21-year-old British junior 400m record at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Since then Rooney admits he has failed to live up to expectations and had not won a major title until last night.

‘I asked myself 100 times where that form had gone,’ said Rooney. ‘The pressure put on me by others is nothing compared to what I’ve done to myself.

‘It’s nice to be a champion now, I’ve never won anything in my life.’

Laura Weightman held on to add a European 1500m bronze medal to her Commonwealth silver. The 23-year-old, coached by Steve Cram, held off Poland’s Renata Plis down the home straight to clock a time of 4min 06.32sec.

Christine Ohuruogu missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in her 400m final. The former world and Olympic champion was bidding to add an elusive European title to her enviable collection.
