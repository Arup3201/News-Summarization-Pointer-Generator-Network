An end-of-terrace former squat has sold for £80million in one of Britain’s biggest ever property deals.

The house, opposite Regent’s Park in London, is spread over a vast 21,500sqft and was once the home of the New Zealand High Commissioner.

Experts expected it to be purchased by a businessman from Russia or the Middle East, but British property mogul Marcus Cooper has snapped up the property.

The end of terrace mansion is regarded as one of the country's most important private properties and sold for £80million

One Cornwall Terrace, London, was designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton

Mr Cooper, 47, who runs the Marcus Cooper Group, has set up a separate company, 1 Cornwall Terrace Limited, to buy the property.

And at £80 million, Mr Cooper's company will have to pay a further £12 million in stamp duty alone.

But they would also pay just £1,369-a-year in council tax - the same as a £320,000 property with Westminster Council - the second cheapest borough in London.

The garden of 1 Cornwall Terrace features beautiful marble staircases and terrace

Hippies turned the beautiful house into a squat when it was empty in the 1970s

Described as 'one of the most important private residences in London', the four-storey home has had a no expense spared makeover to be transformed into one of the capital's premier 'trophy homes'.

It boasts a mixture of classic and contemporary features from marble and limestone-lined halls to iPad-controlled lighting.

There is also a sports complex which includes a gym and swimming pool and the high-tech gates have an automatic number plate recognition system.

Outside, the mansion has a beautiful 40-metre long landscaped garden and a grand double staircase which connects the terrace and landscaped areas.

And if that isn't enough, the home is located on the Outer Circle Road around Regent's Park - which has 410 acres of gardens and leisure facilities.

Despite Cornwall Terrace Mews being one of the most exclusive addresses in the country the property failed to meet its £100million price tag

Mr. Cooper is a private businessman who has spent the past 20 years buying some of the capital's finest homes including the 25-bedroom Witanhurst in Highgate.

Cornwall Terrace was originally designed and built in the 1820s by architect Decimus Burton with the project overseen by famed John Nash. Decimus Burton also built Buckingham Palace.

The front of 'number one' has a neo-classical Stucco elevation with Corinthian pilasters and a grand two-storey bay embellished with sculpted female columns of the Greek goddess Artemis.

In addition to seven bedrooms it also boasts 11 bathrooms, nine reception rooms and a catering kitchen.

The property was bought by property trader Marcus Cooper who runs Marcus Cooper Group

It was the official London residence of the New Zealand High Commissioner from 1955 until the 1970s, playing home to lavish parties attended by royalty and other VIPs.

In 1975, hippies broke into the home and turned it into a temporary squat.

According to figures from the Land Registry, the average price of a house sold in the UK in January was £162,411.

This makes One Cornwall Terrace, at £80 million, 492 times more expensive than the average property.

Gary Hersham, managing director of Mayfair-based Beauchamp Estates, said: 'There have been six or seven sales north of £50 million in the past six months and this is at the top end.

'It is excellent news for the strength of the top-end of the London housing market.

'It also goes to show the soon-to-be-paid mansion tax and potential of capital gains had no significant bearing on the sale of the house.'

Property expert Henry Pryor added: 'It's a trophy home and I'm not surprised by the value, it is probably in the top eight per cent of homes in London.

'It is a cracking address and the purchaser would have had to compete with people from all over the world.

'There are three or four deals like this a year and the sale underlines the confidence in the market."

Mr. Cooper is understood to have bought One Cornwall Terrace after seeking advice from estate agency Knight Frank, which today declined to comment on the sale.

The property was being marketed through Savills estate agents who confirmed the deal but would not give any further details about the transaction.
