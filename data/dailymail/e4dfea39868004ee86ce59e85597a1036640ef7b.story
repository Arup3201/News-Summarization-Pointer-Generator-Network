David Cameron admitted that he suspects the recent devastating floods across the country were the result of climate change.

He was asked yesterday about the extreme weather over the New Year which saw 60mph winds,  torrential rain and tidal waves that left eight people dead and hundreds of homes under water.

But his comments at Prime Minister’s Questions will infuriate some Tory backbenchers who do not accept global warming is affecting Britain’s weather.

Prime Minister David Cameron said lessons would need to be learned from the floods as Labour leader Ed Miliband called on the government to review cuts to flood defence budgets

Indeed, Environment Secretary Owen 
Paterson, who is handling the flooding crisis, is regarded as sceptical 
about climate change and green energy.

The Prime Minister's acknowledgement that climate change could be a factor behind the wild weather came as forecasters warned a Siberian cold front could dump four inches of snow on the country and send temperatures as low as -11C next week.

Mr
 Cameron was responding to a question from Lib Dem president Tim Farron,
 who said: ‘The science is clear that the extreme weather conditions 
affecting our communities, including around the Kent estuary, are a 
destructive and inevitable consequence at least in part of climate 
change.

‘Given that you have
 said this should be the greenest Government ever, will you now agree to
 support carbon reduction targets so we can take real action to protect 
people and property?’

Pledge: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who is regarded as a climate sceptic, has been under pressure over the government's response to the floods

The Prime Minister said, amid groans from his backbenches: ‘I agree with you that we are seeing more abnormal weather events.

‘Colleagues
 across the House can argue about whether that is linked to climate 
change or not. I very much suspect that it is.

'The point is that 
whatever one’s view, it makes sense to invest in flood defences . . . it
 makes sense to get information out better and we should do all of those
 things’.

On targets to 
slash carbon emissions, which some Tory MPs say should be scaled back to
 reduce the burden on household energy bills, Mr Cameron said: ‘This 
Government is committed to carbon reduction targets.

‘We
 worked with the last government to put the Carbon Act into place.

'It 
wouldn’t have happened without our support.

'We also have the Green 
Investment Bank up and running in Edinburgh and it’s going to be 
investing billions of pounds in important green projects.’

Climate
 scientists say no extreme weather event can be entirely blamed on the 
changing climate, but the impact of greenhouse gases on the planet makes
 extreme weather – such as floods and droughts – more common.

December
 was the stormiest month since 1969 because of an unusually fierce jet 
stream, the band of fast-moving air which creates winter storms in the 
U.S. and blows their remnants across the Atlantic.

In a typical winter, 
the jet stream travels at 100mph. This year it reached 230mph.

The
 Met Office predicts that wintry weather will replace the storms next 
week.

Spokesman Laura Young  said: ‘Into the weekend and next week we 
are going to see temperatures return to normal levels for this time of 
year which will make it feel a lot colder and bring a risk of frost, 
fog, and wintry showers.’

But some forecasters are predicting a 
blast of icy air from Siberia after the weekend could bring up to four 
inches of snow the part of northern Britain.

Temperatures
 could plummet to as low as -11C in the exposed north of the country and
 -6C as far south as London, according to some predictions.

The
 dramatic change in the weather may be driven by a freezing front from 
the Arctic moving steadily south over the next few days and meeting 
warmer, wetter air currently hovering over the UK.

Meanwhile, ministers have ordered a major review of the way the aftermath of the storms was handled, which will be presented to Parliament within a month.

It will also examine whether planned cuts to the budget of the Environment Agency will undermine its ability to protect flood defences in future.

Millions of people across the south of England have been told to prepare for more flooding this week, with rivers in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, Surry, Berkshire, Oxfordshire and the Midlands on alert.

There were 102 flood warnings and 181 flood alerts in place, although none of them were deemed severe, which would carry a danger to life.

Labour has called on the government to publish a report by the end of this month giving a ‘full assessment of the future capability of our flood defences and flood response agencies, and whether the investment plans in place are equal to the need for events of this kind’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Some people felt the response time was too slow.’

He demanded to know ‘why it took so long for the energy distribution companies to restore power to homes over the Christmas period and what steps do you believe can be taken to ensure that kind of things does not happen again’.
