Former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch

Boris Johnson must be allowed to stand in a Conservative leadership contest even if he is not an MP, his father demanded yesterday.

Former Tory MEP Stanley Johnson said it would be unreasonable if his son was not able to make a pitch for the Tory party’s top job if David Cameron steps down after the 2015 general election.

London Mayor Mr Johnson is not currently an MP and has said he has no plans to stand before his second term runs out in 2016.

But Mr Johnson senior called on the party to change the rules so his son could stand.

His father waded into the leadership speculation last night by revealing: ‘It would not be a reasonable expression of the way things are if there were to be an election in the Tory party for leader under whatever rules they have - it just wouldn’t be reasonable if Boris somehow was not able to be a candidate.’

Mr Johnson added that, if his son was still mayor, ‘it would be up to the party to find a way of making sure the proper candidates are there’.

He pointed to 1963 when Alec Douglas-Home mounted a leadership campaign from the House of Lords where he was a hereditary peer before becoming an MP.

‘Alec Douglas-Home was not a member of the House of Commons. He was a peer but they found a way,’ Mr Johnson said.

He added: ‘Don’t tell me it wouldn’t be possible to have a system whereby you say: OK life has moved on, there are now important elective offices.

‘Maybe even an elected MEP could stand. At the moment, it says only an MP can stand. Well how reasonable is to say we exclude the MEPs? If you say exclude the MEPs, how reasonable would it be to exclude the mayor of a major city?’

Mr Johnson has already been privately urged to make a return to the Commons before the general election by the Prime Minister and Chancellor.

In theory, Mr Johnson could juggle the final year of his mayoralty while serving as an MP.

There will be pressure on the Prime Minister to follow his predecessor Michael Howard and quit immediately if he fails to win a majority.

Mr Howard stood down straight after losing the 2005 election, giving the relatively unknown Mr Cameron six months to prepare his campaign and emerge as a serious contender.

The Mayor’s father also let slip that his son was a closet fan of Europe.

Mr Johnson senior – who served as a European Commissioner twice and an MEP – said his son ‘is a very good pro-European. He basically had a perfectly good European upbringing, he went to the European School. Don’t tell me he is not. You can’t be called Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson without having a European vocation.’

Yet the London Mayor just days ago told a newspaper that being in the EU was ‘not the be all and end all’. ‘Pulling out would be much less disastrous than people claim. There wouldn’t be a great implosion, just as there wasn’t when we refused to join the euro.’

His father’s candour could deter rank and file Eurosceptic Tories from backing Mr Johnson.
