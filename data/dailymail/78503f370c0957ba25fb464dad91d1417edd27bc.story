The Olympic torch relay saw its first marriage proposal today when a runner got down on one knee and asked his girlfriend to marry him.

David State, who was picked to carry the flame for his voluntary work with the Scout movement, made the romantic gesture as he carried the torch through Loftus, North Yorkshire today.

The 25-year-old stopped to propose to his eight months' pregnant girlfriend Christine Langham, 27, and to the delight of the crowd she said yes.

Mr State, from Redcar, who has raised
 more than £10,000 for charity over the past decade, has also 
volunteered with the British Red Cross for four years.

Redcar
 and Cleveland Council Leader George Dunning said: 'It was an incredible
 moment and we were thrilled to have the Olympic flame come through 
Redcar at such an important time in the town's history and for the relay
 to end with a marriage proposal just capped off a brilliant day.'

Christine, a customer relations advisor, fought back sobs of joy to say yes to her partner of two-years.

Speaking after the proposal, she said: 
'I was in complete shock. I think I still am, it obviously emotional 
anyway watching him run with the torch, but then he palmed it off with somebody and got down on one knee.

'I was surprised I didn't give birth 
there and then. I was trying not to cry, at first I was in a fit of sobs
 a little bit and then 
said yes.'

David, a customer relations manager, had the stunt planned since he found out he would be a torchbearer in February.

But he managed to keep it a secret 
for months before the big day. He handed the torch to a security guard 
midway through his 300 metre dash to 
propose, then took it back to complete his part of the relay.

And he admits it was a bizarre feeling to have to run away from his new fiancee immediately after popping the question.

He said: 'I can't really explain it. 
They only thing that could come out of my mouth at the time was "I've 
got to go" and I ran off with the torch.

'I think if I'd stayed any longer I would have burst into tears. Christine was crying her eyes out, bless her.'

The couple, both of Redcar, 
Cleveland, are expecting their first child on July 10 and do not know if
 they will have a boy or a girl.

They celebrated their engagement immediately after the relay with a family lunch.

The heart-warming scenes came at the 
end of a memorable route through Redcar and Cleveland, where the torch 
also passed Redcar's stunning new 80ft 'Vertical Pier'.

The
 structure provided a striking backdrop as hundreds lined the streets to
 cheer the torch on. The torch also passed through Marske, Saltburn, 
Brotton, Carlin How and Loftus this morning.

Later the Olympic Torch was given a ride on a vintage steam engine on day 31 of its tour around Britain and Ireland.

The relay will see the flame travel 
from Middlesbrough to Hull, and part of that journey was on the 
footplate of a North Yorkshire Moors Railway steamer.

The torch will be carried through the stunning scenery over the moors between Whitby and Pickering.

The
 day’s route will see the relay travel along the coast from Redcar, 
Cleveland, to Whitby, then Pickering and move on to Scarborough, Filey 
and Bridlington before finishing with a party in Hull.

Big support: People turned out to cheer near the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge this morning
