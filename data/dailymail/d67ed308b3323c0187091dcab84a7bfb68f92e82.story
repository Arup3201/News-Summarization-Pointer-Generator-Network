She was married to him just 18 months when he shot and killed John Lennon and faced the possibility of life behind bars.

But 31 years later and Mark Chapman's wife's loyalty shows so signs of wavering.

Gloria Hiroko Chapman married her notorious husband in 1979, the year before he shot the Beatles star outside his Dakota apartment building in New York.

He has been denied parole six times, and is up again in front of the board this week. Yet still, Gloria remains a faithful wife, visiting her husband regularly.

Seventh parole: Chapman has lost a considerable amount of weight since he has been incarcerated - perhaps he has been upping his exercise in preparation for his conjugal visits?

Loyalty: Mark Chapman's wife Gloria has steadfastly stood by her man for the last 31 years, regularly visiting him in prison for conjugal visits

The 57-year-old requested that he be 
allowed conjugal visits with his wife in his current prison - which would take place in a trailer devoid of guards and cameras. The request was granted 
yesterday.

According to the New York Daily News, Chapman had participated in the so-called 'family reunion' program when 
he was an inmate at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility.

When he was transferred in May to 
Wende state prison in Genesee County - also a maximum security prison, 
he had to reapply for the privilege.

State prison system spokesman 
Peter Cutle said: 'He followed
 the standard procedures and protocols in our system, and his request 
for participation was approved.'

The program allows Chapman to be 
allowed to spend up to 48 hours in a trailer with his wife on prison 
grounds - which has a kitchenette, living room and two bedrooms. It is 
free of prison guards and cameras.

His stepfather will also be able to visit.

Mr Cutler said 
of the program: 'We know it has beneficial impact on the inmate both for their behavior 
on the inside and for their eventual reentry into society.'

Wife: Gloria Hiroko Chapman will be allowed to spend 48 hours in a trailer at state prison in Genesee County with her husband, who she married in 1979

Chapman married his wife Gloria Hiroko Chapman in 1979.

Gloria, a Japanese-American and former travel agent, married Chapman in Hawaii in June 1979, 18 months before he gunned down Lennon while he was signing an autograph for him.

According to the New York Daily News, who interviewed Mrs Chapman in 2008 at her single-story, bluish-gray house in the Honolulu suburb of Kailua, the couple have been enjoying these conjugal visits for the last 20 years.

She now works in a hospital in the quiet town of Kailua, 15 miles from Honolulu, and lives in the hospital-owned property across the street with two other women.

Thirty years after the death of Lennon, Mrs Chapman revealed that her husband told her of his plan to kill The Beatles' singer and even showed her the gun he was going to use.

But tapes of interviews with Gloria said that rather than go to police or get help for her mentally-ill husband, she trusted herself to help him through it.

In an interview after his conviction, Chapman actually blamed his wife for not doing 
more to prevent the killing.

He said: 'It's crazy. I laid out the gun
 and I laid out all five bullets - she'd never seen a gun before. And I 
said this is what I was going to do.

'My God, I still have deep-seated 
resentment that she didn't go to somebody, even the police, and say, 
"Look, my husband's bought a gun and he says he's going to kill John 
Lennon".'

He later said had waged an unsuccessful battle with 'little people' inside his head who told him to kill Lennon.

Following his arrest and conviction, Gloria quit her job as a travel agent and dedicated herself to a life in reparation, helping others.

New York Department of Corrections 
member Linda Foglia said the parole board will make a decision on 
whether to release Lennon's murderer by Friday.

Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the 40-year-old former Beatle lived.

He was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.

Chapman was denied parole in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008.

He was last up for parole in 2010, but this was denied because his 'discretionary release remains inappropriate at this time and incompatible with the welfare of the community,' said the New York State Division of Parole.

Chapman is currently being held in protective custody in a single-person cell and is allowed out for three hours each day.

Following his transfer from Attica, Chapman applied to participate in a program called 'family reunion' which allows incarcerated inmates to spend more time with their family members.

On his application for parole in 2010, Chapman said that he killed the much-loved musician because he wanted 'instant notoriety.'

'I made a horrible decision to end another human being's life, for reasons of selfishness, and that was my decision at that time,' said Mark David Chapman in 2010.

'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody, and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies.'

Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow, in previous years has submitted a letter requesting that parole be denied. Her attorney reiterated her position in an email toÂ CNN Saturday.
