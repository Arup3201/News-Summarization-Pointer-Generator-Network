Ghana manager Avram Grant was in jovial mood on Saturday ahead of the Africa Nations Cup final against Ivory Coast, saying he was going to telephone Chelsea captain John Terry to get advice about taking penalties.

Terry famously missed a shootout spot-kick which would have won Chelsea, then managed by Grant, the 2008 Champions League final against Manchester United.

But the defender slipped and sent his shot against the post, giving United a lifeline which they took to go on and lift the trophy in Moscow.

'I'm going to call John Terry for some advice,' Grant quipped to reporters on Saturday when asked about the possibility of the Nations Cup final being decided by penalties.

The loss to Premier League rivals United was Grant's second defeat in a major final in 2008 following Tottenham Hotspur's 2-1 win over Chelsea after extra time in the League Cup showpiece. 

Grant predicted a high quality Africa Nations Cup final on Sunday when his side take on neighbours Ivory Coast in one of the continent's age-old rivalries.

'We have seen quality players and quality football through this tournament but we can expect even more. There are a lot of good players in both line-ups and I think because of that we can expect a quality final,' Grant told reporters on Saturday.

Grant said his team had been given little chance before the tournament but improved dramatically over the three weeks of competition.

'We've shown a lot of motivation up to now and we'll show a lot in the final.'
