Neymar’s father has told a Spanish court that the Brazilian star rejected a more lucrative move to Real Madrid to join Barcelona instead.

According to Portuguese newspaper O Jogo, Real Madrid offered Santos £116m for Neymar, but he instead joined Barcelona in a £50m deal.

The 22-year-old moved from Brazil to Barcelona last summer in a deal that is being investigated. Spain’s authorities have accused the Catalan club of tax fraud over the transfer.
