An Arizona teenager whose body was found near to his abandoned SUV on a heavily-wooded hill in southern Oregon was 'a young man who had a broken heart', his devastated father has said.

The body of Johnathan Croom, 18, was discovered on Monday evening about 1,000 feet from where his vehicle was found abandoned last week, Douglas County sheriff's spokesman Dwes Hutson said.

It had been believed that Croom, from Apache Junction, had run away after telling friends he was interested in taking an 'Into the Wild' type of adventure.

The sheriff's spokesman said that crews had searched the area for several days - calling his name and making noise - but had been looking for a live person.

But when they discovered text messages indicating Croom planned to kill himself, they brought in cadaver dogs and the boy's body was found within hours.

Loss: Jonathan Croom's body was found days after he vanished as he drove from Washington state to Arizona. His father has revealed the teenager was struggling with a break up

The discovery of the texts had changed the nature of the search, Hutson said.

'That
led us to believe that he was probably going to do this,' he said. 'In 
these kind of cases, sometimes people leave very detailed notes and 
instructions. Sometimes, you don't.'

In
a telephone interview from Oregon, where the abandoned SUV was found, 
David Croom said his son was grieving the end of a recent relationship 
with 'someone back in Phoenix'.

'He was a young man who had a broken heart and headed out to try to find himself,' the elder Croom said. 'We're looking forward to finding out exactly what happened.'

He said he had no specifics on a cause of death but he thanked everyone who helped search for his son, adding: 'Please pray for our family.'

The teenager, who was due to start classes in Mesa, Arizona on August 17, had talked with his parents about the book 'Into the Wild' and told a friend he wanted to run away.

Croom
left a friend's home in Seattle on August 16 and was driving home to 
Arizona, but he failed to turn up to his first classes at Mesa Community
College.

On Wednesday, his SUV was found in Riddle, just off Interstate 5. Inside the SUV were Jonathan's wallet, $200 in cash and a
book on outdoor survival tactics.

Hutson said Croom had talked to his parents about Christopher McCandless, whose journey to Alaska was documented in the book 'Into the Wild'.

McCandless
headed to the Alaskan wilderness with few provisions in a bid to live 
simply and appreciate nature. He was found dead in August 1992, when he 
was just 24.

'This was a kid who was obsessed with the
movie,' David Croom told KVAL.com before his son's body was discovered.
'My concern is he is up there with very limited resources, and no 
experience.

Copycat? Family had previously said Croom was obsessed with Into the Wild, a 2007 film starring Emile Hirsh, based on the true story of a graduate who travels across the U.S. with few provisions

'Just
as in that movie, he left everything behind and took off. And we just don't know what he left with.'

His mother Monica added that her son was 'super smart' and had Boy Scout experience.

She added that his SUV didn't 
break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into.

Search teams scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but it wasn't until Monday that they came across the body.

'I think we have kind of a combination 
there,' Hutson said. 'He talked with his parents about Into the Wild, 
and in text messages we've looked at, he does specifically talk about 
running away, kind of just running away from his life.'

On his blog earlier this year, Croom described himself as someone looking for adventure.

Sad: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so

'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live 
extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I 
need to be living the excitement myself.'

But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often.

'These
decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should 
just let these things go and push forward, as I'd recommend to anybody, 
but it's hard.

'I am trying though. I truly am... I will look back and see how far I've come and I will know that anything is possible.'
