The final scoreline suggested otherwise. Yet for Gordon Strachan there were spells of a 6-1 thrashing of Gibraltar which felt like a form of misery.

As rain and wind swirled around the National Stadium the Scots endured an unexpectedly jittery, uncomfortable first half.

Gibraltar, a British Overseas territory of 30,000 residents rejected by FIFA and playing in their first UEFA qualification campaign, reacted to Shaun Maloney's opening penalty by equalising within 60 seconds. It was their first ever goal in a competitive international.

'I have to say that all the credit should really go to Gibraltar,' said Strachan afterwards.

'They made my life a misery for periods of that game. They made it a long game for me as a coach, so well done to them.

'But also well done to my players because there were players out there who personally weren't having a great game but they stuck at it.

'We had some good chances and never took them. It was nice to see Steven Fletcher score a hat-trick I thought he was one of our better players today.'

Of late Fletcher has been the subject of unwelcome headlines. Pictured posing beside a £200,000 Lamborgini shortly after Sunderland had lost 4-0 to Aston Villa the striker had managed just four goals all season.

At international level his last strike was in a 2-1 win over Iceland in April 2009.

'Some of his touches were lovely today,' said Strachan.

'I was wanting more balls in the first half played through but Maloney, Fletcher, Naismith were marked and wanted balls played through.

'We played square too many times because they were ready for it and wanted it.

'We have people who can turn so I was a wee bit disappointed with that as well.

Fletcher is the first Scotland player to score three goals in a game since Colin Stein in 1969

'To be fair the conditions were not great either.

'It was swirling out there. Andy Robertson and Ikechi Anya had problems with the swirling wind in the first half.'

Robertson, the young Hull full-back was dragged out of position when Gibraltar' s Lee Casciano wrote himself into the annals in the 19th minute.

Opting to play with a three-man defence – with just Russell Martin at the centre - Strachan admitted the system had worked less well than he anticipated.

'It did get us four goals, but I was expecting that system to work a lot better than that but the goal sort of threw us a bit. Within any system you are hoping your players will play to a level but in the first ten minutes we gave the ball away eight or nine times, that's too much at international level no matter who you are against.'

The campaign comes down now to Ireland in Dublin on June 13, a huge game in every sense. Win at the Aviva and a play-off place – at least – becomes more likely than not.

'After five games and performances I am delighted with we are here and we have ten points, I think we are all happy with that. We can go into the second half of this group feeling quite good about ourselves.

'I look back at the performances and I think four so far have been terrific.

'This was not one of our best but we got through.

'We scored six goals and if we had woken up this morning and said we would score six we would have settled for that.

'I wouldn't have wanted the one against us, but that's the way football works some times.

'So it's been a good old day for everybody today.

'Gibraltar got their first goal and unfortunately David Marshall will always be that name now who is the subject of quiz questions everywhere.'

Despite the scoreline interm Gibraltar coach Davie Wilson can point to the goal his side scored as evidence of improvement.

They host Scotland in the Algarve in the final round of fixtures and Wilson says: 'As a Scotsman, it's a horrible thought - but we might just be the ones who get the result that spoils my country's party.

'They come to us in the last game and although I'm not naive enough to say we' ll beat them, if Scotland are under pressure to get a result, who knows?'
