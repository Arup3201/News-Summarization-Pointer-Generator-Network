A human rights group has released satellite images which appear to show a Burmese district, known for its ethnic unrest, razed to the ground.

Human Rights Watch says more than 800 buildings and houseboats were torched in coastal Kyaukpyu, in western Rakhine state.

It claims non-Muslims targeted Muslim Rohingyas, in the first serious attack since June, when the rape and murder of a young Buddhist woman in Rakhine in May triggered a string of bloody religious clashes.

Burmese President Thein Sein's spokesman acknowledged that whole villages had been wiped out, while officials say 64 people have died in recent unrest.

However, the HRW fears the figure could be much higher and told the BBC security was desperately needed in the state.

Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at US-based Human Rights said the government needed to concentrate on the causes of the violence, the BBC reported.

After comparing images of the city on October 9 and 25, they claim the differences are painfully clear to see.

The first images show hundreds of closely packed houses and houseboats along the northern shoreline.

But the most recent image paints a stark portrait, revealing the 35-acre district is almost entirely empty of houses and only a few houseboats left bobbing in the inlet.

HRW said many of the inhabitants are thought to have fled by boat out to sea.

A local reporter who visited the site told the BBC's Burmese service the area had been completely destroyed, with some buildings still smouldering. The reporter said the district was also almost totally deserted.

Officials said there were no new reports of violence since Friday and that they have restored order in Rakhine.

Zaw Htay, a spokesman for the Burmese President, admitted that homes had been burned to cinders because of the violence.

They said: 'That's why the government is strengthening security. If necessary, we will send more police and military troops in order to get back stability,' he said.

The UN earlier warned the country's reform programme could be put at risk by continued communal violence between local groups of vigilante Buddhists and Muslim Rohingyas in the western state.

HRW said it feared the death toll from the latest unrest could be much higher, based on witness reports and 'the government's well-documented history of underestimating figures that might lead to criticism of the state'.

In August, Burma set up a commission to investigate the violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the west of the country. Authorities earlier rejected a UN-led inquiry.
