British hostage John Cantlie was brutally tortured by a British jihadi in Syria whom he nicknamed ‘Pinocchio’ because he always lied, court documents reveal.

Mr Cantlie, a 43-year-old photojournalist from Surrey, is believed to be the last British hostage held by the Islamic State who is still alive.

He was captured when he went to report in Syria two years ago and has recently been forced to appear in sickening propaganda videos for the terror group.

Now in the most detailed account yet of the conditions of his captivity under the Islamic State, court documents reveal Mr Cantlie was:

The new testimony was provided by a Belgian who was held captive with Mr Cantlie and Mr Foley between August and September 2013. 

Sickening: Mr Cantlie has most recently been forced to appear in a propaganda video for the terror group 

In an interview with Belgian police, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Jejoen Bontinck, 19, says that ‘Pinocchio’ was one of the guards who tortured Cantlie and Foley while they were held in an IS prison near Aleppo. 

Describing the guard, he says: ‘He came from Great Britain and had dark skin – he was of Pakistani or Bengali origin.’

Bontinck’s evidence will be of particular help to the Security Services who are desperately trying to track down Jihadi John and other IS terrorists who have beheaded four Western hostages, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines.

In the beheading videos, Jihadi John speaks with a British accent and can be seen to have dark skin.

Bontinck was part of an extremist group linked to IS. When he tried to leave the group, they imprisoned him and accused him of spying. His father travelled to Syria last year and helped negotiate his release. 

But Bontinck is now a defendant in a court case in Belgium in which 46 suspects are accused of being part of a banned group, Sharia4Belgium, whose members have gone to Syria to fight.

Bontinck says a second torturer at the IS prison was called Abu Horeia, whom Cantlie and Foley nicknamed ‘very good’. Bontinck explains: ‘They called him “very good” because they once saw him torture someone and he then said “very good”.’

Bontinck also claimed the two journalists were moved on several occasions and ‘tortured’ while ‘barely getting enough to eat’, before they were handed over to an IS group in Raqqa where Jihadi John and other members of the so-called Beatles are based.

He says the first IS prison complex was next to a sharia court which was in an urban part of Aleppo screened by high buildings.

Describing the cell in which the hostages were held, he says: ‘It was an ordinary room with pale brown walls, a pale brown floor in stone and a ceiling of the same colour. There were mattresses and reed mats and we had some books.

‘I think it was about four metres long and eight metres wide. There was electricity and light. It was half underground and the sash window was overlooking a huge dead wall. We had to eat in our cell. Apart from going to the toilet, we had to stay there all day. But still I think of all the prisoners, we were treated the best.’

They passed the time by playing games such as ‘animal, vegetable mineral’ in which they took it turn to guess who or what they were pretending to be.

Evidence: Jejoen Bontinck, 19, the Belgian who was held captive with Mr Cantlie and Mr Foley between August and September 2013. He was part of an extremist group that was linked to the Islamic State

Bontinck adds: ‘They had already been prisoners for ten months. That means it must have been around December when they were taken prisoner. They were tortured by Al Nusra [Al Qaeda]. Torture included waterboarding. They had dirty water to drink.’

During his three-week detention with the two Western hostages, he says they became good friends, exchanging addresses: ‘Our conversations were about the present and the future… that James had better get married and the like. We also talked about what I want to do with my life. I wanted to do something involving computer games. John told me that he had once worked for Sega testing computer games.’

Bontinck says the man in charge of the prison was Abu Hobeida, a Dutch-speaking Arab, whom he described as tall and thin.

He told police: ‘He speaks perfect Arabic. I don’t know why or how he gained this important position. He has two wives and three children – the eldest is about seven. They are also in Syria.’ This man has since been reported to have been executed by IS over allegations of spying.

According to Bontinck’s testimony, Kurdish prisoners held in adjoining cells were executed: ‘I know that people from the PKK [Kurdish fighters] were imprisoned in the corridors of the court. I think their fate had been decided. I suspect they were executed. When I was in the third cell I saw through the gaps in the door clothes lying in a pile down the corridor, whereby I recognised clothing of people who had previously been chained up in the corridor…

‘Sometimes we heard a shot or a few shots in the cell; we suspected that these were executions.’

Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been named in the trial of 46 alleged extremists accused of brainwashing men in Belgium into travelling to Syria where many are now fighting for IS. Prosecutors linked the cleric to Fouad Belkacem, the leader of Sharia4Belgium, which was established under Choudary’s guidance to campaign for sharia law.
