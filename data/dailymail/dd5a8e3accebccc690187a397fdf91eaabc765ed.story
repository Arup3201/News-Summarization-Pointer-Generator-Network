There is too much acceptance, too much tolerance, there are too many people shrugging their shoulders. They seem to be saying: England are out, but we didn’t expect much from them anyway.

Why not? Are we all happy to write off England, out after eight days, and go on holiday thinking, ‘There’s only two months to the start of the Premier League?’ Has the national team fallen so far in our hopes and expectations? That’s embarrassing.

Have England become the equivalent of Australia or South Korea — a country just happy to be here? Home before the bit with the penalty shootouts.

Down and out: Jamie Redknapp is dismayed that England are so accepting of their World Cup fate

Too late: Redknapp believes Roy Hodgson should have started with Ross Barkley in Brazil

I’m often dismayed by an over-reaction, but this time it is an under-reaction! Is that what we thought when Sir Bobby Robson was manager, or Terry Venables? That sitting in fourth place behind three average teams is good enough? I’ll be surprised if any of the teams in our group make the last eight.

All this is making Sven Goran Eriksson look a genius, but was his team any better than the England of 2014? The team that lost to Brazil in the quarter-finals in 2002 was: Seaman, Mills, Campbell, Ferdinand, Ashley Cole (Sheringham 79), Beckham, Scholes, Butt, Sinclair (Dyer 56), Owen (Vassell 79), Heskey.

OK, Sven’s England had a  better central defence but was the midfield superior to Roy Hodgson’s? Tactics have changed but that team is not better than Hodgson’s. So are we prepared to accept he is not in the same league as Sven?

We have good players. Fred and Jo are Brazil’s main strikers but could they get in the England team? Joel Campbell was loaned out by Arsenal but he will be in the last 16 with Costa Rica. So don’t tell me England’s players aren’t good enough.

I love the Premier League: Liverpool’s title charge, Manchester City’s title win, the story of change at Manchester United, the emerging talent of Roberto Martinez at Everton and yes, the new fixture list is out and Louis van Gaal is coming. But he’s not thinking about next season yet and we shouldn’t be either!

England went to Brazil expecting to slug it out in a three-team group. It turned out that group doesn’t include England.

VIDEO England need to toughen up - Gerrard

Germany: Exiting Euro 2000, beaten 3-0 by Portugal’s second string, was their worst performance in a major competition since the war. National coach Erich Ribbeck quit and an overhaul was launched, with Bundesliga clubs and the German FA working towards developing more technically able homegrown players. A programme focused on children aged eight to 14 served by 1,000 part-time German FA coaches. Under 21 players were promoted to senior level.France: The side was so poisonous four years ago in South Africa that the players went on strike before bombing out with defeats by Mexico and the host nation.Huge cleansing was required. Raymond Domenech was sacked, the entire 23-man squad was suspended and federation president  Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned. Laurent Blanc repaired the team before Didier Deschamps (left) was installed after Euro 2012 to complete the job. He comes with the aura of a World Cup winner and will not hesitate to omit star players for the sake of squad unity, as Samir Nasri can testify.Holland: They were dumped out of Euro 2012 without a point — the first time for more than two decades they  had lost three games running. Manager Bert Van Marwijk did the honourable thing and offered his resignation. He found no resistance. In his place came Louis van Gaal, an experienced and highly successful manager at elite club level with a pedigree for developing youth.

And that is a team with Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard at its core, with exciting talent such as Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling — forget their age — as well as Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge.

Hodgson talked about the young squad making progress, but the average age of the starting lineup was 27. Uruguay’s was the same and Italy’s 27.7 — not exactly a fountain of youth.

Throwing on Barkley only when the game is going against England is poor. He has some way to go before he can be compared to Paul Gascoigne, but would England have made it to the last four in 1990 if Robson had shown a similar lack of faith?

I’ve written before that I would have started with Barkley. He could be England’s Gareth Bale but when he came on against Uruguay he was put out on the right. He doesn’t play there for Everton so why should he for England?

Teams in this World Cup have been rewarded for playing with freedom. Were Ghana scared of Germany? Did Iran sit back against Argentina? Have Costa Rica accepted their ranking as the worst team in the group?

They trailed Uruguay 1-0 at half-time and beat them 3-1. They beat Italy with a goal from Bryan Ruiz, who can’t get in the team at relegated Fulham.

Andrea 
Pirlo is Italy’s most influential player but he must have thought it was
 his birthday when he played against England. He made 103 passes in that
 match and only 81 against Costa Rica. They disrupted his game, but are 
Costa Rica really better prepared than England?

England have been too predictable when they had the chance to be unpredictable.

When
 England lost 2-1 to Italy, I worried that was as good as we’ve got and 
so it proved against Uruguay, but why does it have to be this way?

If
 we all just nod as excuses are trotted out — it was too hot, we went 
out to Suarez, we played in the jungle  — then we are condoning the 
acceptance of failure.There are no excuses, no harsh red cards, or 
unlucky penalty shootout defeats.

Exit strategy: Roy Hodgson is facing questions about his future following England's poor performance

Head-scratcher: Redknapp was not impressed when Wayne Rooney was played on the left

Baffling: Mario Balotelli scored Italy's winner against England and Redknapp does not understand why the performance of Hodgson's side was celebrated so much

Pass master: Redknapp says Italy's Andrea Pirlo had it far too easy against England

The Italy loss was celebrated in some places as the best England have played in a decade. But they lost, to Italy!  Is that where we stand now? Championing defeats?

I’m not calling for a change of  manager. And before anyone comments, this is not an attempt to get my dad, Harry Redknapp, a job. That ship has sailed.

The FA have got exactly what they should have expected when they appointed Hodgson. Roy was a very safe option and that approach has transmitted to the performances on the pitch.

But going out in the group stage of the World Cup with only two games played should not be swept under the carpet.

Last year, the FA decided it was more important for young players to sit on the bench for a friendly in Brazil than gain tournament experience with the Under 21s. That is one place to start putting it right.

Another is tournament mentality. After a gruelling game against Italy, England were unchanged against Uruguay. There wasn’t the same sharpness. France left out Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann — two of their best players — for their second match and breezed past Switzerland.

You must show imagination with selection. Rooney out on the wing in the first game... he may as well not have been there. He’s our best player.

Managing England is not an impossible job but people are trying to make it look hard. There is a lot to do. One of the biggest problems is England are falling — and too many people are accepting that fact.
