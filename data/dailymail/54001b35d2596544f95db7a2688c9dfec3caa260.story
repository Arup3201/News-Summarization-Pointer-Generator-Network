Manchester United were forced to issue an ‘unreserved’ apology last night after using a swastika-style logo in a newsletter to fans.

The Premier League champions published the black and red image in an email sent to millions of supporters worldwide.

It featured the headline ‘New Order’ - a play on the Manchester band with the same name - which was used alongside images of the team’s emerging youth players, including Adnan Januzaj, David de Gea and Danny Welbeck.

But the term is also linked to Nazism because of Adolf Hitler’s call in 1941 for a New Order in Europe and caused widespread outrage among fans who received the United Uncovered e-mail.

Many took to Twitter, prompting the club’s head of media, David Sternberg, to tweet an apology. He said an internal investigation had been launched into how the email was cleared for publication.

‘The creative is completely inappropriate,’ he said. ‘We apologise unreservedly and are taking appropriate internal action.’

When contacted by supporters demanding to know why the image, which spelt out the letters in MUFC, had been distributed, Mr Sternberg replied: ‘That’s what is being investigated - obviously it shouldn’t have.’

Senior figures at Old Trafford were described as being ‘taken aback’ by the incident.

Fan David Hills tweeted: ‘I’ve been a supporter for a long, long time, and I’m disgusted by what I’ve just seen.

'To send out a logo which by itself looks like a swastika - and then accompany it with the words New Order - is shocking. I hope somebody gets the sack.’

Manchester United said the title related to the Manchester band New Order, and issued an ‘unreserved apology’ for any offence, which was ‘entirely unintended’.

‘While the headline was intended to reference the band of the same name, it has been pointed out that the graphic had design similarities to a swastika which, combined with other connotations of the phrase ‘new order’, has caused offence which was entirely unintended,’ a spokesman said.

‘For this, United Uncovered unreservedly apologises.’

The gaffe emerged as the Duke of Cambridge told the Football Association that racism is still a problem in the game.

Speaking at a dinner at the Grand Connaught Rooms, central London, to celebrate 150 years of the FA on Saturday, Prince William said: ‘There is sadly more work to do, but it is heartening to see how seriously the FA takes stamping the blight of racism and discrimination out of football.’

Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, who subsequently joined Manchester United, was fined £1,000 by the Football Association in 1996 for delivering a ‘Nazi’ salute to Tottenham Hotspur supporters during a Premier League game in which he was playing for Aston Villa at White Hart Lane.

Spurs have a large Jewish following and this season have been at the centre of another race-related furore involving the word ‘Yid’ which was banned from being used by any fans at their matches.

The derogatory term has been adopted by their supporters as a defence mechanism, with chants of ‘Yiddos’ or ‘Come on you Yids’ being regularly heard at White Hart Lane. One fan was warned and another arrested earlier this month after refusing police requests to cease the chanting during a match.
