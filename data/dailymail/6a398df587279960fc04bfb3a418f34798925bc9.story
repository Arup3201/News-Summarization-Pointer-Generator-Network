This is the moment BBC comedian Simon Brodkin managed to get onto the pitch at a Premier League game and warm up with the Manchester City squad.

Players, including goalkeeper Joe Hart and Kolo Toure and assistant manager David Platt looked on in bemusement as Brodkin, whose is best known for his comic creation Lee Nelson, jogged along the touchline and did stretches.

Brodkin was in the guise of his footballer alter ego Jason Bent, a character from his BBC Three series Lee Nelson's Well Funny People, wearing an identical maroon tracksuit to the City players.

After a full five minutes joining in, his presence finally alerted players, stewards and security staff and he was escorted off the pitch and later arrested.

He was reportedly heard shouting: 'Come on let me play. I've got 50 grand on me to score first' as he was led away.

An Everton spokesman said: 'A man, 
believed to be from the London area, has been arrested by Merseyside 
Police for pitch encroachment.'

A spokesperson for Simon Brodkins told MailOnline: 'Simon was doing some meetings with fans on the street and having picture's taken as his football character Jason Bent for his Facebook page.

'He was then going to see the game as he's a big Manchester City fan and I think the prankster in him couldn't resist.'

Manchester City went on to lose the game 2-0, all but ending their hopes of challenging for the Premier League title this year.

The scenes were reminiscent of a similar stunt involving Manchester City's neighbours and rivals Manchester United.

In 2001, Karl Power managed to get into the team's photo before the Champions League tie with Bayern Munich before disappearing back into the stands to watch the match.

Tabloid newspapers launched a nationwide manhunt to unmask the imposter before his identity was eventually revealed.

In a bizarre twist, play was held up 
in the corresponding fixture between the two sides last season when a 
man ran onto the field and handcuffed himself to a goalpost.Â 

He had been protesting about Ryanair's recruitment policy after his daughter was denied a job by the airline.

He
emerged from the crowd with just under five minutes remaining until 
half-time and shackled himself to the frame of City keeper Joe Hart's 
goal.

After a hold-up which resulted in five minutes of first-half stoppage time, he was released and led away by police.
