By his own account, Ken Livingstone fathered them as a favour and their existence remained secret for almost two decades.

But the former Mayor of London has finally been pictured in public with his eldest children Georgia, 22, and Lottie, 20.

The three were attending the West End premiere of the new Beatles musical, Let It Be.

Mr Livingstone, 67, revealed the 
girls’ identities in his autobiography last autumn, admitting he offered
his services as a sperm donor to journalist friend Philippa Need in the
early 90s.

The one-time Labour firebrand is the 
father of five children by three women. Details of his unconventional 
arrangements surfaced in the weeks before the 2008 mayoral election, 
when he was defeated by Boris Johnson.

Mr Livingstone, then supposedly a 
father of two, confessed to having three secret children by two women 
shortly before publication of a book detailing the relationships.

Their identities remained secret until
last October when he published his life story, You Can’t Say That. He 
described how he acted as sperm donor for two friends who feared they 
were running out of time to have children.

He hinted that they did not use 
artificial insemination – suggesting he slept with the women while 
living with his then partner, Kate Allen.

Good relationship: Ken, pictured with his middle daughter Lottie, has financially and emotionally supported his daughters throughout their lives

His memoir revealed that the first 
request for help came from Miss Need – a freelance journalist Mr 
Livingstone had known for 12 years –  who ‘was very keen to have 
children, although she had not found the right partner and the clock was
ticking.

‘We had never been involved 
romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful
mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children. I’d
be around taking an interest and supporting them emotionally, but we 
agreed that I would not be living with them.’

Miss Need’s first child with Mr 
Livingstone, Georgia, was born in August 1990 and Charlotte – known as 
Lottie – in September 1992. Both daughters took their mother’s surname.

Friend: Livingstone offered his services as a sperm donor to Philippa Need (now Philippa Hutchinson), head of media at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north-west London

Weeks after his second daughter was 
born, political activist Janet Woolf gave birth to his first son, Liam, 
in November 1992 in the same north London hospital.

Mr Livingstone said he met her in the early 1990s when he was MP for Brent East and she was a  Labour activist.

At the time, he was in a long-term 
relationship with Kate Allen, UK director of Amnesty International.

The 
couple lived together between 1982 and 2001 and it is not known whether 
she was aware of the arrangements for Mr Livingstone to father the three
children.

A decade later he went on to have a 
son, Thomas, and daughter, Mia – in 2002 and 2004 – with journalist Emma
Beal, whom he married in 2009.

In his autobiography Mr Livingstone – 
who goes on holiday each year with all five children and their three 
mothers together – does not make clear whether the three eldest children
were conceived by artificial insemination or naturally.

He later said: ‘That’s as much detail 
as we want to go into. I don’t think it implies artificial insemination.
It’s an autobiography, not porn.’
