British brand Boots have been accused of ripping off their UK customers as their No7 products can be bought for a fraction of the price in the U.S.

Many of the products in the company's popular beauty range costs £10 less from the U.S. store Walgreens than is charged by Boots in their UK stores and online.

For example, the No7 Lift & Luminate Day Cream costs £23 from Boots while from Walgreens, it is available for $20.99 (£12.47).

Ugly truth: Boots anti-ageing products are cheaper in the U.S

Meanwhile, the Boots No7 Protect & Perfect Intense Serum is £24.95 from Boots but $24.99 from Walgreens (£14.85).

Boots was founded in the UK when John Boot opened his first store in 1849 in Nottingham selling herbal remedies. It opened its 1,000th  store in 1933 followed by
 the No7 cosmetics range two years later.

Over
 the decades, Boots have remained a trusted and popular store on the British
 High Street - there are now 1,112 health and beauty stores nationwide 
and 65 flagship stores and its headquarters remain in Nottingham.

Its
 modern range of No7 anti-ageing skincare has won awards and is in 
demand following proven results in consumer testing and clinical trials.

But one British beauty blogger said 
'it's a kick in the teeth' that products from such a historic British 
brand are more expensive for UK consumers.

Charlie Lankston, who writes the blog Small Fish Big Pond,
 said: 'This drives me mad! It's the case with so many beauty products 
and brands unfortunately; I went to New York recently and went on 
something of a large beauty spree. Part of this was because I was so 
eager to pick up products that aren't yet available here but a lot of it
 was to do with the fact that everything was so much cheaper over there.

Saving: The No7 Day Cream is £23 in the UK, left, and £10 cheaper at Walgreens at $20.99

'U.S. drugstores have brilliant deals that mean you can pick up products for a fraction of the price that you can here.

'Needless to say it can make you feel a bit frustrated at times and when a British brand seems to favour its American consumers over beauty lovers from its home nation, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth.'

Hayley Carr, who writes the beauty blog London Beauty Queen, agreed.

She told the MailOnline: 'I'm incredibly disappointed to learn that a British brand with so much history is offering their products at much cheaper prices outside the UK. I've come to believe that because Boots develop and retail all their own products that they're offered at the most affordable price point, cutting out the usual margins that retailers take.

'However, this has fundamentally lead me to question the brand's ethos and pricing structure - there's such a massive difference in price from the UK to the U.S. that it makes you wonder how this is even possible? Or why they're willing to offer their products at a much cheaper price point, which will no doubt have a negative impact on their brands perception and position in the long-term.

'It appears that British consumers are getting a hard deal, when we've been the ones supporting No7 from its inception. Bad form Boots.'

Meanwhile, Lauren John, who writes the lifestyle blog These City Days, said: 'I always expect price variations with currency changes and so on, but for a brand that in my eyes doesn't do a whole lot throughout the year through offers and promotions on their products, it's a bit disappointing that UK customers don't benefit from savings, even occasional ones, especially from leading products like their serums.'

A Boots UK spokesperson told the MailOnline: 'At Boots UK we know our customers want the best quality products at affordable prices. Which is why we offer our UK customers great value in lots of ways that we know you really appreciate. 

'We offer benefits through our Boots Advantage Card, which gives you 4 points for every £1 you spend, as well as  regular promotions, including 3 for 2 across lots of your favourite products and customised coupons, throughout the year. You can visit boots.com to find out our latest prices and offers.'

Walgreens 
bought a 45 per cent stake in Boots the Chemist owner Alliance Boots for
 6.7 billion dollars (£4 billion) in 2012 and it was announced 
today that they will form a partnership with the U.S. retailer under the company 
name Walgreens Boots Alliance.

Despite the partnership, the Boots headquarters will remain in Nottingham.

Bargains: Dozens of beauty products are cheaper in Walgreens stores than in the UK

Boots aren't the only company who are charging more for their beauty products in the UK.

Brands such as Maybelline and L'Oreal can be bought for less on the otherside of the Atlantic.

And it's not just on beauty products that Brits are getting a bad deal. Yesterday, the Daily Mail reported how Swedish company Ikea are charging British buyers more than consumers in the U.S. and Europe for its products. 

And last month it emerged that British shoppers were paying hundreds of pounds more for TVs, computers and tablets compared to U.S. consumers.

Research by Which? discovered that a top-of-the-range Samsung TV costs £755 more in the UK than in the US.

An Apple MacBook Pro 13in laptop was £355 more expensive here, while the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games consoles cost £95 more when they were bought in Britain.
