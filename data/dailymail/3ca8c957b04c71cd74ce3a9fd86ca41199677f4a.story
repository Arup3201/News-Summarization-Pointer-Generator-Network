The USA squad will score a record World Cup win bonus of £19.5million if they manage to go all the way.

The 23 players in Jurgen Klinsmann’s squad will earn £850,000 per man in the unlikely event that they lift the trophy in Brazil.

FIFA have confirmed they will pay the tournament winners £22m and the US players, including Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard and Aston Villa’s Brad Guzan, are set to bank the lion’s share of the prize.

Talking tactics: Jurgen Klinsmann gets his point across to his players during training earlier this week

‘The vast majority of the funds we receive from FIFA for the World Cup  will go towards player appearances and bonuses,’  a US Soccer Federation spokesman confirmed.

England players, including skipper Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, will earn £350,000 each if they win the tournament.

If Ghana or Nigeria win the trophy, their players will earn just £60,000 each.
