At least five people have been injured after mounted police rode into a large group of anti-Nazi protestors during a demonstration in Malmo, Sweden.

More than 2,000 people had turned up to protest against a meeting held by the neo-Nazi Svenskarnas Parti (The Swedes’ Party) in a square near the Oresund Bridge which connects Sweden and Denmark on Saturday afternoon.

The protest soon turned violent, with activists attacking police and horses, and in an attempt to disperse the crowd, police rode in full gallop through a group of 300-400 people.

Neo-nazi party Svenskarnas Parti had 
arranged a meeting in a square in the Limhamn area of Malmoe on Saturday
 ahead of the national elections next month.

Although
 party leader Stefan Jacobson only attracted a few dozen supporters, 
thousands turned up to protest against the meeting, including hundreds 
from Denmark.

Up
 to 400 police officers had been called in to keep the peace, including backup 
from Stockholm and Gothenburg, surrounding the square where the meeting 
was held.

An estimated 
2,000 anti-Nazi protesters marched on the square from a nearby park and 
police struggled to control the large crowd.

The protest soon descended into chaos, a police spokesperson said, and a number of demonstrators turn on police and attacking staff and horses, throwing rocks and flares.

Unrest: At least five people were injured after the demonstration turned into chaos and activists began attacking police and horses with flares, rocks and bottles

Mounted action: The police repeatedly rode in full gallop into a crowd of 300-400 people, witnesses said

To control the commotion, police moved in on the protesters with horses and armed vehicles, one of which ran over an activist.

A group of people blocking a street refused to disperse, after which 
mounted police rode in full gallop into the crowd.

According to 
witnesses the man seen in the pictures being trampled did not have time 
to escape the horses and injured his head and jaw.

‘I stood right there when it happened,’ Aftonbladet’s reporter Susanna Nygren said.

’It
 is a narrow street where they rode ten horses abreast in full gallop 
towards a group of about 300 to 400 people. Police kept repeating this.’

Another witness told Aftonbladet that police had ridden over a man, only to return and ride over him again as he lay injured in the street.

Police confirmed that five people had been taken to hospital and one man had been slightly injured after being run over by a police van.

'This has not been very much about politics,' Scania Police's spokesperson Ewa-Gun Westford said.

'The
 focus switched to violence very quickly and people have been throwing 
flares and bottles on police and hit horses with sticks and bats.'

Svenskarnas
 Parti are not expected to win any seats in parliament in next month’s 
election, and when the party moved off the square, the crowd dispersed.

'It goes without saying that we are not happy with what happened today,' Westford said.

Six people were detained for violence, public disturbance or masking themselves. It was not immediately clear whether they would be charged.
