When photographer Trent Parke was just 13-years-old he was at home alone with his mother when she died  from an asthma attack right in front of his eyes.

In an instant the Sydney photo journalist's childhood was gone and his whole life changed forever. 

He refused to attend her funeral, too traumatised by what had happened and blocked out all his memories. 

Instead he locked himself away in his mother's darkroom in their Newcastle home and picked up her camera, which hasn't left his side since.

Now, 43-year-old Parke, who is the only Australian member of the prestigious group Magnum, has unlocked his harrowing childhood for the first time, showcasing nearly 2000 photographs at the Art Gallery of South Australia as part of his Black Rose exhibition.  

'From the moment that mum died it was just get on with it get on with life,' Trent told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I would sit there and think about from that point on: Why are we here? Where are we going? What is life? and ever since then I've been continually searching and looking for the answers to life and the camera always helped me do that.'

'It's been a way of trying to deal with something I didn't ever want to deal with.'

As he grew older, Parke's main ambition was to become a professional cricketer. After playing for NSW, Parke moved to Adelaide to join the cricket academy but soon realised the career wasn't for him. 

He took a job at the Daily Telegraph and soon after became a photographer for The Age, which sent him touring with the Australian cricket team.

However, when Parke's landlord called saying he needed his house back, Parke took it as a sign. 

He and his wife, photographer Narelle Autio, picked up their two boys and set off on the journey of a lifetime, taking seven years to embark on a path of discovering, which cumulated in The Black Rose exhibition.

The items in the exhibition, his largest ever, have been hand-picked from more than 7,000 reels of film, 15,000 words scribbled in diaries, and 14 published books.

Parke used his camera like therapy on his trip and he admits it got him through the tough experience of losing a parent. 

The Black Rose symbolises his long journey, his mother's funeral and the fact that she is not alive any more. 

While on his way around Australia, Parke came across a black rose and took a cutting of it, planting it in his garden so he and his father and brothers can use it as place where they can remember their mum. 

The black rose is now 1.5m long and is a strong symbol for the prestigious photographer.

Parke admits that he does not remember a single thing about his mother, apart from the fact that she was an amateur photographer 

'The only thing I remember was that she was an amateur photographer who used to send photographs into the local newspaper as part of their $5 reward page,' he said.  

'The mind works in amazing ways when you're confronted with such pain at such a young age.

'You just don't want to go there and you don't want to think about it and I've continued to run ever since until this project eventuated and it's been a very long journey.'

His mother's ashes were 'thrown to the wind', leaving Parke with no memories or place to go to feel close to this mum. 

'One day she was here the next she was gone,' he said. 

For the exhibition, which is mostly about life's questions, luck and chance, Parke strived to expose his soul. 

However, he admits that he wakes up every day thinking of his exhibition.

'I'm just sick of thinking; I can't remember a time when I didn't have a thought in my head,' he said. 

'There’s a lot of layers to it. Hopefully it’s an exhibition where people can walk through it and visually see some good photography.

'It’s always about discovering things so hopefully people will make the same discoveries if they dig hard enough hand they can see the connections between all things.'
