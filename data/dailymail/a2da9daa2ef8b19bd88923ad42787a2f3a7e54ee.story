Miles, 28, was found dead wearing only her lingerie after being stabbed several times in a Jacksonville hotel room in the 'unprovoked' attack

Police say that Hurst, who until recently owned a landscaping company, arranged a meeting with the women after seeing their post on backpage.com. 

The site, which is ostensibly an online classified page, is used extensively by prostitutes who sell their bodies online. Police have not said that the two victims in this case are prostitutes. 

Police and firefighters responded to the Hawthorne Suites after a fire alarm went off. When they arrived, witnesses directed officers to room 222, where they discovered Miles dead. 

The other woman was taken to the hospital in critical condition. She identified her attacker as a man she had met online. 

Police also used cell phone records to tie Hurst to the attack. 

The survivor told police that Hurst had attacked the women friends without warning or provocation. 

He slashed Miles less than five times before she died, but repeatedly hacked the other victim  'in excess of 20 times,', according to police.

Miles, a mother-of-one, had posted an ad on backpage.com for a threesome with her friend, according to police

Miles' friends posted tributes on her Facebook page and said she had a hard life and didn't deserve the fate that befell her

Police found Hurst at his Jacksonville home about 12 hours after the attack. He was arrested on charges of murder and attempted murder. 

Friends posted tributes to Miles on her Facebook page. One woman wrote: 'Jenna I have known u since we were kids u never had it easy. No one deserves to go through what happened to u. 

'All I can do is pray that u can finally find the peace u have always been looking for. R.I.P u were an angel when u were born now u can be a angel again!!!'

Hurst, whose Facebook page also shows that he is a father, recently posted that he's 'been a dad, a spoiled kid, an athlete, a party animal, a ladies man.' 

'...I've also lost it all, money, reputation, motivation, my faith, "true friends", hope.' 

Hurst owned a landscaping business until recently and had a young daughter, according to his Facebook page
