Managers of the Soma coal mine knew methane levels were too high and are therefore responsible for the deaths of over 300 workers, one miner has claimed.

Erdal
 Bicak, 24, had ended his shift in the Soma coal mine on Tuesday and was
 making his way to the surface when managers ordered him to retreat 
because of a problem.

Workers gathered in one area to hastily put on gas masks - but the worker claims they were told too late. He said: 'The company is guilty. The new gas levels had gotten too high and they didn't tell us in time.'

His claims come as another worker 
revealed how his trapped colleague tried to hang himself rather than 
face the horror of being burned alive.

Hasan
 Ozdil said other miners smashed their heads against walls in despair 
knowing they would die in the fire that ravaged the pit.

He
 spoke as government and company officials denied that negligence caused
 Turkey's worst mining disaster, which has left almost 300 people dead.

But
 opposition politicians raised questions about oversight and a survivor 
said safety inspectors never visited the lower reaches of the mine.

Mr Ozdil told the Daily Mirror: 'I saw a worker with a belt around his neck as he tried to commit suicide.

'There was gas so I withdrew. I was told some of the workers had hit their heads against walls.'

He claimed the gas masks being used by some of his colleagues were not working.

He added: 'The masks have to be inspected every six months, but no-one inspects.'

Anger continued to surge in the wake of the coal mine inferno in the western town of Soma that has killed at least 298 miners.

Yesterday, police used tear gas and 
water cannon to disperse rock-throwing protesters in Soma, where about 
1,500 demonstrators urged Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 
government to resign.

In 
Istanbul, police forcefully broke up a crowd of about 150 people who lit
 candles and lined up mining helmets on the ground to honour the victims
 of the disaster, the DHA news agency reported.

Energy minister Taner Yildiz said at least 298 people died in Tuesday's tragedy.

Another two or three people are believed to be missing underground while 485 miners escaped or were rescued.

However, other political parties believe that estimate is too low, with one union official claiming the final death toll could be 'more than 400 and possibly as high as 500'.

The
 government has asked for a parliamentary inquiry into the disaster to 
find out what happened and why - but it appeared that officials had 
already made up their minds yesterday.

'There's
 no negligence with respect to this incident,' insisted Huseyin Celik, a
 deputy leader of the ruling party. He said the mine in Soma 'was 
inspected vigorously 11 times since 2009'.

He added: 'Let's learn from this pain and rectify our mistakes...(But) this is not the time to look for a scapegoat.'

Mr Bicak, however, said the last 
inspection at the Soma mine was six months before the disaster. He said 
the inspectors only visit the top 100 yards of the mine and the managers
 knew that.

So, the managers would clean up the top part of the mine and the inspectors never saw what was below, he said.

The
 miner said the pathways are really narrow and steep down below, and the
 ceilings are so low miners cannot stand up, adding that is why it was 
so hard to get out.

But Akin Celik, the Soma mining company's operations manager, echoed the government's argument.

'There's
 no negligence with respect to this incident. We all worked with all our
 heart and soul. I have not seen anything like this in 20 years,' he 
told reporters.

The question remains, however, of how the mine could have been checked so often and still have such a deadly fire.

The chief prosecutor in the nearby 
city of Akhisar said prosecutors had begun interviewing some of the 
injured miners and other witnesses.

Ozgur
 Ozel, an opposition politician from the Soma region, petitioned 
parliament in October to hold an inquiry into mine safety but the 
proposal was voted down.

He 
says there is a mine accident every three or four months in the Soma 
region and eleven workers have died in the last three years.

Mine inspections do take place but the owners are tipped off up to a week before, he alleged.

Mr
 Ozel's party has criticised the government for not adopting the 
International Labour Organisation's convention on mine safety, widely 
regarded as the industry standard.

Joe
 Drexler of the Global Union Federation visited Turkey several times 
between 2008 and 2010 to urge government officials to ratify the ILO 
convention and improve health and safety in the country's mines.

'I have no doubt that this disaster could have been averted if this convention had been accepted,' he said.

Funeral prayers were said in mosques throughout Turkey for the victims and football fans draped their team's scarves over some of the graves in Soma.

Mr Erdogan attended one such ceremony in Istanbul. The disaster could hurt his political ambitions - he has made no secret of his desire to run for president in the country's August election after serving as prime minister for the last 11 years.

President Barack Obama called Turkish President Abdullah Gul to convey condolences and offer assistance, the White House said.
