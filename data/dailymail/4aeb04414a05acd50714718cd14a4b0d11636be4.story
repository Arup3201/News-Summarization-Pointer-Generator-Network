One of the models whose account of an encounter with Terry Richardson appears in New York magazine's controversial profile piece on the photographer has decided to set the record straight on what really happened that day.

In Benjamin Wallace's cover story, model Sena Cech, is portrayed as a somewhat naive teenage model, who 'laughs' when Richardson presents his penis to her during a photo-shoot and is asked to 'twist and squeeze it really hard'.

In a written response made public on Monday, Cech refutes this account of the session which happened when she was 19, describing instead Richardson's nudity as ambush-like and even more disturbingly says the 'experience was not consensual. It was revolting and humiliating.' She even goes on to describe him as a 'poor sick man.'

Setting the record straight: Model Sena Cech has written a strong denial regarding the circumstances of her photo shoot with Terry Richardson when she was 19-years-old

Fashion photographer Richardson, 48, used the New York piece published this week to vehemently deny all accusations of inappropriate conduct during his photo shoots, saying the pictures were taken as part of collaborations by those involved who were 'exploring sexuality.'

Indeed, a source close to Richardson told Buzzfeed that despite the email they received from Cech, she instigated the sexual encounter and that the shoot was not her last with the photographer, nor was it the last time they took sexual pictures together.

However, in her strongly worded rebuttal of the interview and Richardson's behavior, Cech, now a mother of two, recounts a very different story from the New York piece.

While Benjamin Wallace writes that she was unaware of Richardson's reputation for producing 'risqué' work, Cech claims that she 'completely taken off guard.'

'I was not warned that I would be expected to pose nude of engage in any sexual activity at the casting.'

While Cech does not deny at any point that she did grab Richardson's penis and posed for pictures like this, she is adamant that she 'did not instigate the penis twisting, nudity or any kind of sexual touching.'

While Wallace writes that Cech ultimately found the experience 'weird', the model instead writes she found it 'humiliating'.

Cech admits that there is merit to the argument Wallace frames of Richardson as an artist or a predator.

but her
 email to Buzzfeed claims that 'what the article does not make clear is 
that Richardson's sexual escapades go way beyond artistic 'boundary 
pushing' and involve serious sexual harassment and abuse of young models
 in the workplace.'

Cech contends that she was 'abused' by Richardson and labels him a 'poor sick man.'

In
 one heartbreaking section of her email, Cech outlines the hurt caused 
by the source close to Richardson who claimed she instigated the 
touching.

'This is a flat-out lie. I remember going home after the casting and crying hysterically, unable to tell my boyfriend why I was upset and unwilling to share with him that I had been coerced into this bizarre sex act at work,' writes Cech.

Fashion photographer Terry Richardson has denied claims of inappropriate conduct in a new interview

Wanting to set her story straight, Cech believes that Richardson 'clearly violated my rights.'

Richardson has strongly denied previous accusations - mostly from models he has worked with - that he has acted inappropriately towards them.

Allegations against Richardson have come from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well as younger, more anonymous models, but most have been incredibly damning of his conduct towards the women he works with.

'It was never just me and a girl, ever,' he said. 'It was always assistants, or other people around, or girls brought friends over to hang out. It was very daytime, no drugs, no alcohol. It was a happening, there was energy, it was fun, it was exciting, making these strong images, and that's what it was. People collaborating and exploring sexuality and taking pictures.'

Recently in an e-mail to Jezebel, a New York-based writer and stylist named Anna claimed that she was 23 when the controversial photographer invited her to a photo shoot at his home, where he proceeded to ask her to reveal her 'tits' while he posed next to her.

He then apparently asked her to crouch down on the floor, and 'suddenly, I felt a d*** pressing into the side of my face,' she reveals. 'He pressed it to my lips. He clearly wanted a blow job and wanted it documented on camera.'

She described the horrifying moment when she realized Richardson, who was 43 at the time, was pressing himself against her while his assistant giggled and snapped photos.

'I didn't want to act scared or angry because I was in this guy's apartment with no one else around aside from his equally screwed-up assistant and who knows what these psychos were capable of,' she wrote.

Anna said she was hasn't revealed her story until now because she thought no one would care about a 'non-model' being sexually assaulted, especially without any solid proof.

But she was finally prompted to open up after hearing recent reports that New York magazine is planning on doing a cover story absolving Richardson of the multiple sexual assault accusations he has faced over the years.

'The guy shouldn't just be locked out from the fashion photography world, he should be in jail,' she stated. 'Add another girl to the list!'

Richardson, 48, has strongly denied previous accusations - mostly from models he has worked with - that he has acted inappropriately towards them.

In a letter obtained by Page Six in March, he called the allegations 'lies' and said the claims were nothing more than an 'emotionally-charged witch-hunt'.

'People have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales,' he said. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors. Without my voice, all that remain are the lies.'

Allegations against Richardson have come from high profile celebrities and actresses, as well younger, more anonymous models, but most have been incredibly damning of his conduct towards the women he works with.

Supermodel Coco Rocha told Fashion magazine in July 2010: 'I've shot with [Richardson] but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.'

And Danish model Rie Rasmussen said that the girls who work with Richardson 'are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.'

Yet he continues to be one of the most sought-after photographers in the fashion industry, having done shoots with Charlize Theron, Mariah Carey, Rita Ora and Lindsay Lohan in the past three months alone.
