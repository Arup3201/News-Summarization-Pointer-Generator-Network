As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. 

BOJAN KRKIC IN A NUTSHELL 

Plenty wonder whether Lionel Messi could hack a wet, windy Tuesday night in Stoke, and this may be the closest we'll ever get to finding out.

But who is the man that made sure his name was on the team sheet before Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thierry Henry at Barcelona? Quite simply, it's none other than Stoke City's new forward.

In the 2007-08 season, a teenager by the name of Bojan Krkic was breaking into the Barcelona first team - and nothing was getting in his way.

He became the youngest-ever goalscorer for the La Liga giants in October 2007 against Villarreal - aged 17 years and 54 days - and was called up to the Spain squad, only for illness to hinder him.

Now,  he's 23, has had his share of tough times with Ajax, Roma and AC Milan, and is about to be given a taste of the Premier League.

Will you pick Bojan Krkic? The Stoke City forward costs just £7.1million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE BOJAN IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM 

There's little shame in being bumped out of a Barcelona team overwhelmed by frighteningly-good talent, but the Spaniard learned a thing or two during his spells at the Nou Camp.

Most importantly, he proved a natural born goalscorer.

He'll nab a goal or two on more than the odd occasion in the Premier League, and looks to be a steal at £7.1million, particularly after proving a quick starter already.

In three pre-season games, Bojan scored three goals against Schalke, Blackburn Rovers and Real Betis. There's nothing to suggest he won't continue that trend throughout the season.

He did learn from the best in Spain after all.

He can only hope his so-so form at Roma and Ajax don't follow him to Stoke. 

TELL ME SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT BOJAN

How does being Barcelona's youngest-ever goalscorer strike you? 

Or what about being the youngest-ever player for the club to feature in the Champions League?

Or breaking Lionel Messi's record as the youngest Barca player to compete in La Liga?

Perhaps most importantly, Bojan broke Raul's record of most goals scored in a debut season, netting 10 times at the age of 17. Yikes.

Former: Bojan broke a series of records for Barcelona and is a very exciting prospect for Stoke this season

Learned from the best: Bojan took note from the likes of Lionel Messi and Co during his spells at Barcelona

Youngest Barcelona player in La Liga against Osasuna  (aged 17 years, 18 days)

Youngest Barcelona player in the Champions League against Lyon (aged 17 years, 22 days)

Youngest Barcelona goalscorer with goal against Villarreal (aged 17 years, 1 month and 22 days)

Youngest Barcelona player to debut for Spain after call up aged 18

HE'S CHEAP

And that's an understatement.

Can you afford not to have a punt on Bojan, even as your third-choice striker?

The Stoke forward is just £7.1m, and looks well worth every penny. He raised eyebrows making the move to the Britannia, which shows how good the starlet is considered to be.

At youth level, Bojan was close to scoring 900 goals in just seven seasons before pushing his way up to the first team. How Stoke City would love him to deliver such form to the Premier League.

Five players more expensive than Bojan? 

Steven Fletcher (Sunderland, £7.5m), David Nugent (Leicester City, £7.6m),Yaya Sanogo (Arsenal, £7.2m), Arouna Kone (Everton, £7.6m) and Darren Bent (Aston Villa, £8.1m) all cost more to name a few...

Making a point: Thierry Henry was kept out of the side at times by Bojan during his early days at Barcelona

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Steve Sidwell would recommend you buying Bojan, too.

The 31-year-old midfielder told Talksport: 'Bojan has looked very impressive and very sharp during pre-season, and he’s scored some goals as well.

'But it’s what you expect when you look at the teams he has played for, especially his education at Barcelona.

'He’s a great prospect for us, he’s an exciting player and I’m looking forward to seeing him in action when the season begins.'  

On the up: Bojan will test himself in the Premier League after not-so-good stints with Roma, AC Milan and Ajax
