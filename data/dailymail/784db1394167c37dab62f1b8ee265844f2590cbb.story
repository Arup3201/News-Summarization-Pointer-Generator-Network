Sun-powered lasers could protect Earth from any more asteroids judged to be flying too close, a new study claims.

U.S. researchers have outlined a plan for solar powered space defences which could vaporise an asteroid as big as the one which flew past Earth on Friday night in 60 minutes.

The same system could destroy asteroids 10 times larger in about a year, with evaporation starting at a distance as far away as the Sun, the researchers claim.

Sun-powered asteroid-busting lasers: Described as a 'directed energy orbital defense system', DE-STAR is designed to harness the power of the Sun and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams

After Earth's close shave with asteroid 2012 DA14 on Friday night - and the unexpected meteorite explosion which injured 1,000 Russians that morning - attention has turned to technology which could be used to defend our planet.

The 130,000 ton, 150ft-wide lump of space rock hurtled past at 17,400mph - eight times as fast as a bullet from a high-powered sniper rifle - making its closest approach at 7.25pm on Friday evening.

If it had struck our planet it would have exploded with one thousand times the force of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.

In the run up to the close shave - an event which occurs roughly once every 40 years - astronomers were keen to point out that their calculations showed little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 actually hitting our planet.

But in the event a similar, or bigger interloper is spotted on a collision - an event thought to happen every 1,200 years or so - academics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, have outlined a plan to destroy it before it can destroy us.

They say their concept, dubbed Directed Energy Solar Targeting of Asteroids an exploRation, or DE-STAR, is 'a realistic means of mitigating potential threats posed to the Earth by asteroids and comets.'

Described as a 'directed energy orbital defence system', DE-STAR is designed to harness the vast power of the Sun and convert it into a massive phased array of laser beams.

These can then be aimed at any threatening-looking asteroids to destroy them before they can get too close.

Gary Hughes, a professor at Cal Poly, who contributed to the research, said: 'This system is not some far-out idea from Star Trek.

'All the components of this system pretty much exist today. Maybe not quite at the scale that we'd need – scaling up would be the challenge – but the basic elements are all there and ready to go.

'We just need to put them into a larger system to be effective, and once the system is there, it can do so many things.'

Indeed, the researchers say that aside from vaporising extinction-level event size asteroids, the DE-STAR system has a number of other potential uses - even as a spaceship propulsion system.

Professor Hughes and UC Santa Barbara physicist Philip Lubin calculated the requirements and possibilities for DE-STAR systems of several sizes, ranging from a desktop device to one measuring six miles in diameter.

The larger the system, the greater its capabilities, they said.

For example, DE-STAR 2 – at 100m in diameter, about the size of the International Space Station – 'could start nudging comets or asteroids out of their orbits,' Professor Hughes said.

Powerful: This plot shows time to evaporate an Apophis-like asteroid versus its diameter, versus several laser power levels. The baseline DE-STAR 4 system has approximately 100 gigawatts of laser power

But DE-STAR 4 – at 10km in diameter, 
about 100 times the size of the ISS – could deliver 1.4 megatons of 
energy per day to its target, said Professor Lubin, obliterating an 
asteroid 500m across in one year.

Such
a sized system could also accelerate interplanetary travel far beyond 
what is possible with the chemical propellant rockets used today, 
Professor Lubin claims.

It could also power advanced ion drive systems for deep space travel, he said.

Able
to engage multiple targets and missions at once, he claimed, DE-STAR 4 
'could simultaneously evaporate an asteroid, determine the composition 
of another, and propel a spacecraft.'

Larger
still, DE-STAR 6 could enable interstellar travel by functioning as a 
massive, orbiting power source and propulsion system for spacecraft.

It
could propel a 10-ton spacecraft at near the speed of light, allowing 
interstellar exploration to become a reality without waiting for science
fiction technology such as 'warp drive' to come along, said Professor 
Lubin.

Scalable: This plot shows DE-STAR laser power and spot diameter versus DE-STAR array size. The DE-STAR system is modular and can be built up in sections each of which is immediately operational

The researchers say recent and rapid developments in highly efficient conversion of light to electrical power have made such advances a possibility today when just 20 years ago they would have appeared impossible.

An asteroid big enough to destroy London skimmed past the Earth at just after 7pm on Friday night.

The flyby by the 150ft, 130,000 ton chunk of space rock was the closest shave for an object of this size since records began.

Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting our planet, if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Its closest approach - passing within 17,000 miles, which is closer than some satellites - was at 7.25pm GMT.

The flyby occurred just hours after a much smaller meteor exploded above Russia's Ural Mountains.

Astronomers said the two events were merely a coincidence and that the objects were travelling in opposite directions.

'Our proposal assumes a combination of baseline technology – where we are today – and where we almost certainly will be in the future, without asking for any miracles,' said Professor Lubin.

'We've really tried to temper this with a realistic view of what we can do, and we approached it from that point of view.

'It does require very careful attention to a number of details, and it does require a will to do so, but it does not require a miracle.'

Professor Hughes added: 'These are not just back-of-the-envelope numbers. They are actually based on detailed analysis, through solid calculations, justifying what is possible. And it's all available under current theory and current technology.

'There are large asteroids and comets that cross the Earth's orbit, and some very dangerous ones going to hit the Earth eventually.

'Many have hit in the past and many will hit in the future. We should feel compelled to do something about the risk. Realistic solutions need to be considered, and this is definitely one of those.'

Professor Lubin, who began work on DE-STAR a year ago, said: 'We have to come to grips with discussing these issues in a logical and rational way.

'We need to be proactive rather than reactive in dealing with threats.

'Duck and cover is not an option.'
