The US is still trying to apologize to Brazil for spying on a number of the country's senior officials.

So it was no surprise smooth operator Joe Biden took time out of his schedule to see President Dilma Rousseff being sworn-in for a second term.

Beaming throughout his historic visit on New Year's Day, the Vice President looked delighted to reunite with the Latin American leader.

After the ceremony in Brasilia he bounded up to her, clutching her hands, laughing raucously and whispering in her ear.

Charmer: Vice President Joe Biden was seen whispering in the ear of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff

All smiles: The 72-year-old flashed a grin at the cameras as Rousseff, 67, laughed along

Rousseff, 67, chuckled along - though she appeared to strike a serious tone at one point, holding her finger up to a solemn-faced Biden as she spoke.  

Biden, 72, is the highest ranking official to attend a presidential inauguration in Brazil since 1990.

He has been the key intermediary between Obama's office and Rousseff's since Edward Snowden exposed the NSA's snooping on Brazil. 

Documents leaked by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden revealed that Rousseff's personal phone calls and emails, and those of other Brazilians, had been spied on by secret US eavesdropping programs used to monitor the Internet.

The revelations froze relations between Brazil and the United States.

Outraged, Rousseff canceled a rare state visit to Washington and demanded an apology from President Barack Obama. 

The United States has publicly regretted the incident but has so far stopped short of issuing a formal apology.

In July 2014, Rousseff eased tensions by saying she understood the Obama administration was not directly responsible for the spying.

'I do not believe the responsibility for the spying habits lay with the Obama administration. I think this was a process that began after September 11,' Rousseff said on CNN, in reference to the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington that led the United States to tighten security measures and step up surveillance of the Internet to identify terrorist threats.

Having a ball: Biden, who has visited Brazil twice since the revelation, smiled with Argentina's Amado Boudou

Promises: He has vowed to ensure a closer relationship with Rousseff's administration from now on 

Being sworn-in, Rousseff turned her attention to domestic issues.

She vowed to restrain government spending and curb inflation to pull Brazil out of a four-year slump.

Tackling corruption is also at the top of Rousseff's priority list after she was tied to a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras.

She said: 'We have lifted 36 million people from extreme poverty.

'It is time to pursue new goals. Brazilians want high-quality health and education services, security and that corruption be tackled.

'The Brazilian people have understood this is a long-term process. I have been re-elected to carry out the big changes Brazil needs.'
