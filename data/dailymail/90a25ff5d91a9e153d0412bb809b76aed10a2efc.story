Hernanes struck deep into stoppage time for Inter Milan as the hosts came from behind twice to earn a point against Napoli at the San Siro on Sunday night.

The 29-year-old headed home from close range to cap a dramatic finale to the match, after Jose Callejon's goal just moments earlier  looked to have given Rafa Benitez's men all three points.

It was the former Real Madrid forward who had given Napoli an unlikely lead on 79 minutes, after a defensive lapse in the home penalty area between Nemanja Vidic and Dode gifted the 27-year-old the opportunity to net his fifth goal of the season - and he took it with aplomb.

But Inter replied within just three minutes, with Fredy Guarin scoring with his first touch of the game to level the match - just a minute after coming on - with his second goal of the season. And Walter Mazzarri's men were at it again in stoppage time, as Hernanes' scored what could be a crucial goal in the former's tenure at the San Siro after a poor start to the season from his side.

It was Mauro Icardi who was causing all the problems for Inter early on, having two chances on goal in quick succession, only to be thwarted by crucial blocks from the Napoli defenders.

The 21-year-old, who has scored four goals in eight appearances for the Italian giants this season, has expressed his desire to extend his current deal with the club  and he again was impressive for Inter on Sunday night.

The hosts would go close again on 23 minutes as Dode floated in a dangerous ball from the left with Icardi's header inches away from nestling into the far corner.

In a rare attack from the visitors during the first period Marek Hamsik forced Samir Handanovic into action on 29 minutes, as Rafa Benitez' side looked to get some kind of foothold in the game.

It was Inter who continued to control proceedings though, as they went agonisingly close to taking the lead 10 minutes later, when Hernanes showed great composure to chest the ball down and spin away from his marker, before his half-volley struck the post and came out into play.

So on reflection Benitez's side were somewhat fortunate to have gone into the break all square after an inept attacking display.

There were signs of an instant improvement from Napoli within five minutes of the break though, with Hamsik teeing up Lorenzo Insigne, who squandered a golden opportunity to make it 1-0 as his tame effort rebounded off the post.

Up the other end Vidic went close to scoring his first goal for Inter since joining from Manchester United, as he rose highest from Rodrigo Palacio's corner, but his header went just over.

The game looked to be petering out for a draw before all the last-gasp action unfolded, as Callejon struck twice either side of goals from Guarin and Hernanes, with the hosts ending their two-match losing run and in turn climbing one place to ninth, while Napoli remain seventh.
