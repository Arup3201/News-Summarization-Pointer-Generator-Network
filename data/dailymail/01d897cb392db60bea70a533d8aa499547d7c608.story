There was drama aplenty during Queretaro’s defeat to Chiapas at the weekend.

Ronaldinoho, who signed a two-year deal with Mexican club Queretaro in September, was forced to play peacemaker as his team-mate Willian went on the rampage.

After Queretaro FC midfielder Willian was shown a second yellow card after he scythed down a Chiapas player on the break.
