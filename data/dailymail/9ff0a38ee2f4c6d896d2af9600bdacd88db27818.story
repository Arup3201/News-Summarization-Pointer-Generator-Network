Falling sick at sea can be an expensive nightmare for cruise passengers who may find themselves facing expensive medical bills, a new report warns today.

Passengers who need to see a doctor on board their cruise ship complain of being hit by charges they feel are excessive, according to the investigation by Which? Travel.

The report says that to many holidaymakers used to getting free NHS health care at home, the medical costs on board cruise ships come as a painful shock because they are all charged at private healthcare rates.

Passengers on cruise ships feel they are being ripped off by cruise companies' on-board medical services

A survey by Which? found that one in five of the 1,368 members who had been on a cruise reported that they had visited the ship’s doctors.

They faced an average bill of £233 -- but 12 of the claims were for £500 or more and one reported a charge of £6,500.

Three in ten of those who saw a doctor had to foot the entire bill themselves as they could not claim any of the cost back on their insurance.

Nearly one in five said they could claim part of the cost back and had to pay the excess while four in ten said they could claim all the cost back but had to pay the excess.

The majority of these charges were for one-off visits as six in ten people saw the doctor only once.

Which? Travel says that one passenger who forgot to take enough blood pressure pills with her on a P&O cruise found that her forgetfulness cost her £154.

Another passenger was presented with a bill for £2,500 after being admitted to the ship’s medical centre with pneumonia.

Although her insurance policy covered £2,000 she had to make up the £500 difference.

'These are not isolated cases “ said Which? Travel. 'Our members reported huge variations in how much they had to pay on cruise lines.'

Angela Smith, commercial manager for Healix Risk Rating, which advises insurers on medical risks says that these charges can come as a shock to holidaymakers used to receiving free health care in the UK.

She told the magazine: 'If someone is required to pay £70 on board a ship to see a doctor, this won’t break the bank.

'However, a hefty medical claim that requires hospital treatment will. Very few people can afford £10,000 or £100,000 to pay these expenses. '

Which? Travel asked five of the biggest cruise lines in the UK market - Cunard, Fred Olsen, P&O, Princess and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL) to tell them their medical charges, and they all said costs were in line with UK private medical care.
