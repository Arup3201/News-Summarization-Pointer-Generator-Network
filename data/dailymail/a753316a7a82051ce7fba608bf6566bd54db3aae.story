Arsenal will have to make Sami Khedira their highest paid player if they are to tempt him from Real Madrid.

The German midfielder is available for £24million but is paid around £8million a year at the Bernabeu.

That is more than £150,000 a week and in excess of the £140,000 Mesut Ozil earns at the Emirates.

On the move? Sami Khedira is a target for Arsenal but his wage demands could be a stumbling block

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is looking to strengthen his midfield and is also interested in Khedira's international team-mate Lars Bender.

Leverkusen, however, are reluctant to sell Bender, 25, having only recently tied him down to a new long-term contract.

Wenger is also keeping tabs on Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin while Chile star Alexis Sanchez is close to signing for £30m from Barcelona.
