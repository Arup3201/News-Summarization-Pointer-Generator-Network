North Korea has released footage of leader Kim Jong Un carrying out pre-flight checks then reportedly flying a plane in a new television documentary.

The video begins showing the 31-year-old sitting in the cockpit of what is believed to be a Antonov -148 aircraft and making pre-flight checks by glancing over a flight manual as well as holding on to the controls.

It then cuts to a shot showing the back of Kim's head while he another pilot guide the plane down the runway for take-off.

In the new footage, Kim Jong Un is seen looking at a flight manual as part of pre-flight checks 

The North Korea leader puts is manual down and prepares to take handle the controls of the Antonov -148 aircraft

The pair can be seen holding on to the same lever before the North Korean leader appears to take control of the plane.

After showing scenic footage of hills and rivers, while patriotic marching music is played in the background.

Kim can then be seen pointing out of the window at the landscape before the plane comes into land.

And when it touches down, Kim appears to land the plane with just one hand on the controls.

It is unclear when or where the footage was taken.

The plane then makes its way down the runway, with Kim appearing to be at the controls alongside a co-pilot 

During the clip, the exterior of the plane is never shown, and it is often claimed that he tries his hands at plane controls even though he is not known to have nay qualifications as a pilot 

However during the clip, the exterior of the plane is never shown and when it appears he is flying the plane, only the back of his head is visible.

Earlier this year, a South Korean newspaper observed that Kim appears keen to show that he does not suffer the same pathological fear of flying as his father, Kim Jong-il, who travelled as far as he could get on a special armoured train.

They claimed that he often tries his hands at the controls, although he is not known to have any qualifications as a pilot.

'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul in May.

An undated picture of Kim Jong Un released yesterday. Earlier this year, a government source in South Korea said Kim 'likes steering aircraft' 

Kim's wife is presumed to support his preference for flying around North Korea, rather than travelling by road or train as her father is said to have been a pilot.

The clip showing the young leader is one of a number that has been released recently after he wasn't seen in public for more tha 40 days.

No official reason was given for his disapperance and it is thought he was suffering from ill health.

In recent state TV footage of Kim his weight appears to have ballooned - thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese.

He has also been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media earlier this year, he appeared to have difficulty walking.
