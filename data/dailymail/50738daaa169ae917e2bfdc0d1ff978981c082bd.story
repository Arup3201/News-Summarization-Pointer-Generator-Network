The 77-year-old Carry On star was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of East London.

Miss Windsor, who played landlady Peggy Mitchell in EastEnders for more than ten years, was nominated for a career in stage, film and television spanning seven decades.

‘This is a great honour for me because I have such a deep connection with the East End,’ the actress, who was born in Shoreditch, said after the ceremony at The O2 Arena in Greenwich. 

‘Not only was it the place I was born but it has played a huge part in my career and continues to inspire me. 

'I know if my mother was alive today she would be so proud of me and say, “That’s my girl”.’

The university is split between several campuses in the capital and the ceremony takes place at The O2 Arena in Greenwich
