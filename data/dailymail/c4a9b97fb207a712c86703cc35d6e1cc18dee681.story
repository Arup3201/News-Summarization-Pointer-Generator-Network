A property in Sydney's inner-west with rotting floors, crumbling ceilings, and packed full of garbage sold for $923,000 over the weekend.

The uninhabitable dump on Durham Street, Stanmore, went under the hammer on Saturday, and had bids from 20 serious buyers.

The bidding started at $600,000 but quickly climbed, before selling for $923,000, which was 15 to 20 percent higher than the expected price, according to selling agent Ron Alexander.

The two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore sold for $923,000, despite the fact that it is uninhabitable in its present state

From the outside it doesn't look too bad, though the state of the house indoors is a different matter entirely

The property needs a lot of work before it will be fit for human habitation

The realtor estimates that with renovations, including a new kitchen, new floors and new ceilings, the property could sell for $1.2 million

The house is still littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors have already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property

The two-bedroom art deco home was described by Mr Alexander as a 'basic dumpster'. It is littered with broken-down appliances, old clothing, and furniture, and this is after Mr Alexander removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property.

'It's very run-down, very basic… But it's got a hell of a lot of potential,' he told MailOnline last week.

But Mr Alexander said the dilapidated condition of the property 'put people on' rather than putting them off the purchase.

'They like the basics, just the demand is a lot stronger for the basic dumpster, rather than the reno-ed you-beaut [house],' he told MailOnline.

He said that buyers want to be able to 'do it your own way rather than undo someone else’s taste.'

Evidence of this, he said, was the fact that 32 Durham St, Stanmore, a fully-renovated three-bedroom home in great condition, sold for $980,000 on Friday, less than $60,000 more than the 'dumpster' down the road.

The house is a deceased estate that has not been on the market since it was first built in the 1930s

The property is extremely neglected and it would be a huge job to renovate

The house is in a very derelict state, but is in an excellent location

The house was sold to a builder, though there was some interest in the property from 'brave hearts' - young couples who are keen for a renovation challenge

The house is in one of the best locations in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore

Before auction, the property had already attracted offers in the late $700,000s due largely to the location of the property.

'The location is outstanding, it's in one of the best parts of Stanmore,' said Mr Alexander. 'The home has very strong bones.'

The house was purchased by a builder, and ninety percent of interest in the sale came from builders and professional renovators, along with the odd 'brave hearts' – young couples who want to take on a serious fixer-upper.

The backyard is in an extremely unkempt state, and nine truckloads of rubbish have already been removed from the property

Mr Alexander estimated that if someone 'fixed up all the warts' of the house – putting in a new kitchen, new ceilings and polished floors – they could sell it for $1.2 million.

It could go for even more if builders extended the property.

The deceased estate dates back to the 1930s and it has not been on the market since it was built.

The property sold at auction on Saturday and the realtor was thrilled with the price fetched by the home

In many places the carpet and floors have worn through and would need replacing

The house is quite a fixer-upper, it needs new ceilings, as they have collapsed in some places
