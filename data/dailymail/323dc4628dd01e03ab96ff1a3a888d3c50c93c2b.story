Brit: Mohammed Hadi is believed to have travelled to Syria to join ISIS, an increasingly-powerful Islamic militant group causing chaos in the Middle East

A British teenager has joined the fanatical band of Islamic terrorists rampaging across Syria and Iraq and killing thousands, it has been reported.

Mohammed Hadi, 18, from Coventry in the West Midlands, is believed to have joined ISIS, an increasingly-powerful Islamic militant group leaving a trail   of dead in the troubled region.

The youngster, of Iraqi Kurdish extraction, is known as 'Osama Bin Bieber' after the Canadian pop star because his youthful appearance.

Hadi is said to have been radicalised by extremist clerics at a madrassa (religious school) in the city and travelled to the Middle east with three   other men.

He has posted pictures of himself on Instagram holding guns, and posted tweets claiming to be in Syria with ‘Dawla’, another name for ISIS.

His parents are believed to have reported him missing to police back in March. It has 
also been reported that police were previously warned about his growing extremist 
outlook.

The Sun On Sunday spoke to Mahir Hadi, 38, the father of the teenager.

He said: 'We can't talk about it - I don't know anything about it. The police   know better than me.'

Twitter users have reported that Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya Al Kurdy, is currently near the northern Syrian town of Sarrin with a group of Chechens.

Meanwhile, Nova K. Doski, a London-based
 Kurd, posted: 'I'm still laughing at this toddler. I said from the 
start he will become a terrorist.'

A Coventry local said he saw the teenager's father in tears after discovering what he had done. He said: 'He was so frightened that he would die out there and was furious his on had   persuaded his son to do something crazy.'

An Imam at the madrassa said Hadi did attend but when he discovered his plans to travel to the strife-hit region he called West Midlands Police.

A spokeswoman said: 'Police are investigating the whereabouts of an 18-year-old man from the Stoke Heath area of Coventry as a result of concerns raised by family members. The man was last seen on 26 March.

'Officers are keeping an open mind as to the man’s whereabouts; however the investigation is being led by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit and one line of enquiry is that he has travelled to Syria.'

Dr Abdullah Shehu, who chairs the Coventry Muslim Forum, told the Coventry Telegraph he did not know of any local people who have travelled to Syria to join ISIS.

He said: 'This is something that the Coventry Muslim Forum have morally condemned. We advise people never to engage in such a practice at all.

'We work closely with the police and with the council in order to prevent these actions.'

former pupil of the city's Sidney Stringer Academy, which hit the 
national headlines in 2010 when a 13-year-old pupil was threatened by 
other pupils after   praising British troops in Afghanistan.

The news about Hadi comes soon after two Britons were seen in an ISIS recruitment video urging other British Islamists to join their holy war.

Reyaad Khan, 20, sits with a Kalashnikov assault rifle against his shoulder alongside 20-year-old gap-year student Nasser Muthana – also seen in the video urging Britons to join ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria.

Nasser had taken £100 from his father to go on an Islamic seminar in Shrewsbury in November, but instead went to Syria.

Three months later his brother Aseel, 17, left the house saying he was going to a friend’s for the night, but the following evening it transpired that Aseel had obtained a second passport by lying about his age and was in Cyprus, travelling to Syria.

Police across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone.

Yesterday it emerged that around 500 Britons had travelled to Syria and Iraq - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William   Hague.

Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner and head of specialist operations, warned that Britain would feel the long-term   consequences of the conflict for 'many years to come'.

She said it represented a terrorist threat to the UK, and that young British Muslims who have travelled to the war-torn country to fight might commit   violence when they return.

'I'm afraid I believe that we will be living with the consequences of Syria - from a terrorist point of view, let alone the world, geopolitical   consequences - for many, many, many years to come,' Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend.
