A £200million skyscraper has had an undeniably dazzling effect on passers-by – but not, unfortunately, the one intended by its architect.

20 Fenchurch Street, better known as the Walkie Talkie due to its distinctive shape, is reflecting blinding rays of light onto the street below, damaging the panels and wing mirror of a Jaguar XJ.

The car belongs to Martin Lindsay, the director of a tiling company, who parked his Jaguar in central London's Eastcheap on Thursday afternoon.

Blinding: Martin Lindsay with his Jaguar XJ, which was damaged by bright light reflected down from the tower

Melted: The wing mirror after it was warped by the extreme heat on a road in the City of London

He said he is amazed such a thing could happen.

'They’re going to have to think of something. I’m gutted. How can they let this continue?' he told City A.M.

The car was in the ray for just an hour but the panels were buckled and there was reportedly a smell of burning plastic.

Mystery: The building developers are investigating the bizarre phenomenon

'Burning plastic smell': The car was said to have been in the ray for just an hour but the panels were buckled

Other owners whose vehicles have been damaged by the unusual phenomenon, believed to be caused by the building's concave design, have also come forward.

Eddie Cannon, a heating and air conditioning engineer, said his Vauxhall Vevaro suffered a similar fate the day before.

He said: 'The van looks a total mess – every bit of plastic on the left hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a bottle of Lucozade that looks like it has been baked.'

Blinding: The phenomenon takes place in the afternoon on bright days in the City of London

Due to it's concave design, sunlight is reflected into a very localised point in the early afternoon

Precaution: Authorities have closed the City of London parking bays affected by the localised light

People walking buy often have to shield 
their eyes from the incredible glare and the building has been dubbed 
the 'Walkie Scorchie' by nearby workers.

Joint developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf said they are investigating, adding: 'As a precautionary measure, the City of London has agreed to suspend three parking bays in the area which may be affected.'

20 Fenchurch Street is a 525ft tall, 37-storey skyscraper set to be completed next year, it was designed by architect Rafael Vinoly.

Further damage: The seat of a bicycle parked near the building was also allegedly singed by the blinding light
