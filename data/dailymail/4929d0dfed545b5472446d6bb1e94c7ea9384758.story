Its famous slogan says 'should have gone to Specsavers' but this probably isn't what they had in mind.

A silver Ford Fiesta smashed into the 
glass window of the front of the opticians store in Sevenoaks, Kent, 
around lunchtime yesterday.

A passer-by spotted the crash and posted pictures of the accident next to the opticians' famous catchphrase.

The shop window was left cracked but had not completely smashed to pieces while the vehicle had relatively minor damage to its front.

The car was left at a right angle to the road and had completely blocked off the pavement to pedestrians.

Police said it was not clear what had caused the car to crash, but it is understood no one was injured.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'I can’t give you any details about the incident at this time. It’s not been brought to my attention yet so it must be a low-level incident.'
