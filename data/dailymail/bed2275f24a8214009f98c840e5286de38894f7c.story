David Moyes's tactical nous has come under serious scrutiny this season as Manchester United have lurched from one crisis to the next - and now one of his former players has claimed his successor at Everton is a better tactician.

England midfielder Ross Barkley, 20, was given his debut by Moyes in 2011 but he has excelled this season at Goodison Park under Roberto Martinez as Everton have outperformed Moyes's underachieving United side. 

When asked how Moyes and Martinez 
compare, Barkley told Match of the Day Magazine: 'He’s similar to David 
Moyes as they both like to take over the training session and be the 
main man.

'But Martinez is more tactical. We do a lot more tactical work which is good for me because I’m young and still learning.'

He added: 'Roberto Martinez has come in and given everyone confidence. He’s a positive man and doesn’t say anything negative.

'I’m an Evertonian so I want the club to be up at the top end of the table and it’s great to be a part of it.'

Barkley has earned rave reviews in what has been his breakthrough season and the midfielder has earned his first three England caps.

His performances have drawn comparisons with a young Paul Gascoigne but Barkley revealed that it was a Frenchman who was his hero growing up.

'My hero was Zinedine Zidane,' added Barkley. 'I used to watch a lot Spanish football and videos of him. There was also Paul Scholes, and Wayne Rooney, because he came through the Everton system at a young age, like I have.'
