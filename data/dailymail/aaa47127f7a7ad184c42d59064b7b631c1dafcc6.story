Politicians have lavished a quarter of a million pounds of taxpayers’ money on vanity portraits of themselves.

The spree included £11,750 for an apparently topless painting of Labour’s Diane Abbott – the same amount as was spent on a full-sized statue of Baroness Thatcher.

Other works include an £11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary Margaret Beckett, a £10,000 portrait of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, an £8,000 painting of Kenneth Clarke and a £4,000 oil painting of Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Labour left-wingers Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner had portraits commissioned which cost £2,000 and £2,180 respectively.

The
 bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since
 1995 and approved by the Speakers’ Advisory Committee on Works of Art. 
By far the bulk of the spending came in the second term of the New 
Labour government.

The huge sums were signed-off by a 
little-known committee off MPs which each year asks some of the 
country’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues.

Far
 from recording only those who reach high office, it has also ordered 
works featuring left-wing firebrand Dennis Skinner, photographs of SNP 
MP Pete Wishart and a series of pictures have been taken of the 
committee themselves.

The 
House of Commons insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in 
recent years, but the details reveal the scale of the spending from 
records dating back to 1995.

And some MPs have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost.

This striking portrait of Diane Abbott was produced by artist tuart Pearson Wright in 2004

A life-size statue of Margaret Thatcher, which stands in the Member's Lobby of Parliament, cost the same as the Diane Abbott portrait

Grandee: Tory former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who is now a minister without portfolio, was painted by James Lloyd in 2007

Jonathan
 Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘While the 
public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded 
the honour of a painting or bust in Parliament, it would certainly seem 
that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to 
identifying subjects.

‘Regularly
 splashing out four or five-figure sums for these portraits has the 
whiff of an expensive vanity project, for which unwitting taxpayers are 
footing the bill.

‘When 
photographs are so much cheaper than paintings, politicians need to 
think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their 
friends on canvas, or even in bronze.’

A
 portrait of Commons Speaker John Bercow cost £22,000 to commission, 
with an extra £15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with 
other paintings in the Speaker's House.

Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has been feature three times, in a £1,500 portrait in 1997, an £8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £9,000 bronze bust in 2000.

The costs were revealed by a Freedom of Information request by the Evening Standard.

Decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, a cross-party group that is currently chaired by Labour's Frank Doran.

From 1995 to 2000 just three MPs were chosen to be featured in a portrait, at an average cost of £3,375.

But from 2000-05, 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £7,180. Between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £9,300 each.

A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Parliamentary Art Collection at the House of Commons records those who have made a significant contribution to UK political life over the centuries and in each parliament the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection.

‘In recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn. This is part of the House's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014-15.’
