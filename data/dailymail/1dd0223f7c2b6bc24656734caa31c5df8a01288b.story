On November 8, 1985, Tom Odle, 18, brutally murdered his parents and three siblings in an LSD-fueled rage in the small Illinois town of Mount Vernon.

The mass murder shocked the nation, and Odle was sentenced to death by lethal injection. However, in 2003 his sentence was commuted to life in prison, prompting Odle to reach out to a neuroscientist to try and understand what had driven him to commit the horrific act.

Odle teamed up with Dr. Robert Hanlon, a neuropsychologist from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who had examined him in the past.

Convicted killer: Tom Odle, 47 (pictured in recent mugshot), is serving a life sentence for the 1985 murders of his parents and three younger siblings after his death sentence was commuted in 2003 

Their collaboration has resulted in the non-fiction book Survived by One: The Life and Mind of a Family Mass Murderer, which was published last month. 

According to Hanlon, the 47-year-old Odle, who is currently serving a life sentence at the Dixon Correction Center after spending 17 years on death row, is filled with 'extreme regret and guilt' over his crime.

‘Beyond that, he feels shame not only for what he did with is life and the murders of his family, but how it affected his community and other relatives, friends of the family and teachers,’ he told ABC News. ‘Everyone knew his family and the monumental crime.’

The book, for which Odle received no monetary compensation, is based on his letters to Hanlon and their therapy sessions, in which the inmate recalled suffering years of abuse at the hands of his 'sadistic' mother.

According to Hanlon, Odle was driven by revenge when he went on a rampage in 1985.

During the process of self-reflection and analysis, Mr Odle has revealed that his mother was physically and emotionally abusive, mostly tormenting him and his brother Sean, while their father idly stood by and did nothing to defend them.

Tom Odle's sibling was at one time removed from the home after he told school officials that he was often denied food and chained to his bed while his mother went out.

Odle grew up to be a troubled teen, turning to drugs and petty theft. By 1985, his parents wanted him out of the house.

On November 8, the 18-year-old was supposed to move out of his family's Mount Vernon home.

Instead, Tom Odle took LSD and stabbed his 39-year-old father Robert to death with a butcher knife.  He then waited for his mother, Carolyn, to return home. As she entered the house, the son attacked her with a knife, stabbing her in the neck to death.

Odle concluded the bloody rampage by murdering his 14-year-old sister, Robyn, and his 13-year-old brother Sean, and strangling to death Scott, 10.

Dr Hanlon explained that Tom Odle exterminated his innocent siblings because he was in 'a homicidal state of mind' after killing his parents, comparing it to an out-of-control freight train.

Unlike many other mass murderers, Odle was not suffering from a major mental illness, and according to Hanlon, he could appreciate that was he was doing was both morally wrong and criminal in nature.

Police discovered the slain family when Robert Odle failed to show up for work that day. Tom was quickly tracked down to a nearby motel and arrested. The teen never denied killing his family.

On May 29, 1986, a jury panel deliberated less than two hours before finding Odle guilty of five counts of murder.

His court-appointed lawyer James Henson said during his closing arguments that his client was 'feeling sick and nauseated' as he was killing his family, but he could not stop.

'Something took hold of him,' he told the court. 'Something made him do it.'

Henson cited testimony from psychologists and psychiatrists that Odle was a victim of years of abuse by a sadistic mother in a family setting where violence was the norm.

'His being forced to leave (home) was the ultimate rejection, the ultimate abuse and what pushed him over the edge,' Henson said. 

Expert opinion: Dr. Robert Hanlon, a neuropsychologist from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said that therapy sessions with Odle have revealed the inmate was filled with remorse and guilt

Odle was sentenced to death, but in 2000 then-Illinois Governor George Ryan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty.

Three years later, Odle's death sentence was changed to natural life.    

According to Dr Hanlon, until that point the death row inmate was living in denial and repressing the memories of his crime because he believed that he was soon going to be executed.

But following the commutation of his death sentence, Odle was faced with a future, which prompted him to contact Hanlon in order to understand what had driven him to murder his family in the hope of preventing other such tragedies.
