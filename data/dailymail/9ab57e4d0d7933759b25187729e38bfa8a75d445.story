Tottenham and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head in the January transfer window as both clubs seeks to bolster their strike force for the second half of the season with Colombian Jackson Martinez at the top of both clubs wish lists.

As revealed in Football Grapevine last month Porto have put several Premier League clubs on alert with the news that striker Martinez is up for grabs for a fee in the region of £30million.

Although Liverpool insist Mario Balotelli will not be put on offer in January, the Reds are in the market for a new striker.

Martinez could be available for £30m if he were to leave Porto

Martinez is one under consideration, as is West Brom’s Saido Berahino, whom the Baggies will try and get £25 million-plus for.

Likewise Martinez and Berahino are on Tottenham’s radar.

West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino is also a target for both Liverpool and Spurs

Tottenham could use striker Roberto Soldado as part of the deal to sign a striker in January

Spurs may be able to do a deal with Porto whereby they only pay £20million in a deal that sees Roberto Saldado go the other way, although part exchange deals are always hard to finalise especially mid-season.

That said Liverpool, despite saying he will stay, could try and do a deal with Napoli which would see Balotelli return to Italy and the Reds sign £30million rated striker Gonzalo Higuain.

Real Madrid have targeted their next ‘Galactico’ signing, Germany’s Marco Reus.

That is likely to scupper Manchester United’s hopes of luring the Borussia Dortmund midfielder to Old Trafford in January.

Our Madrid source told the Football Grapevine: ‘There is talk of Manchester United wanting Reus and for sure he will leave Dortmund. Bayern Munich want him too… but he is the player Madrid want next summer, or even in January. And the club is confident of getting him. They normally do get their target’

The proposed arrival of Reus at Madrid though confirms the departure of fellow German Sami Khedira.

We are told that could then mean United making a move for Khedira, who has long been a target for both Arsenal and Chelsea.

United also believe they will be able to outbid Arsenal in the pursuit of another Dortmund player - centre half Mats Hummels.

Cheick Tiote could yet secure a move from Newcastle to Liverpool in January despite hysterical red top front page headlines with regard to an alleged driving offence.

Jan Vertonghen is set to quit Tottenham in January. Liverpool could move in for the Belgium international who can play as a centre half or at left back.

West Brom are poised to make a move for West Ham’s out of favour midfielder Matt Jarvis.

Jarvis has failed to settle at the Hammers since his £10.75m from Wolves in 2012.

But the Baggies would not want to pay more than £5m for the player.

Arsenal are ready to send Joel Campbell out on loan in January. There will be plenty of interest in the Costa Rica forward, with Southampton being one possible destination.

I AM HEARING:

While Sir Alex Ferguson will maintain his public support for Manchester United and genuinely rates Louis van Gaal as a coach, I hear that the former Old Trafford boss is rather bemused at the club suddenly adopting a spendthrift approach in the transfer market. He is wondering whether over a quarter of centuries worth of canny work under him that made the club the commercial giant it has become could be undermined as a consequence of seeking quick fix and expensive solutions.

Sir Alex Ferguson is said to be bemused by Manchester United's high spending in the transfer window

I AM ALSO HEARING: 

Steve Gerrard is torn between spending the next two years at Liverpool or ending his playing career with a completely new experience.

Gerrard has told his Anfield bosses that he won’t be rushed into signing the new two-year contract on much reduced terms which he was offered last week.

Steven Gerrard is considering his options before deciding where to end his career 

Several MLS clubs are interested in Gerrard as are NASL club New York Cosmos.

And former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez would be interested in taking Gerrard to Napoli. And another Italian club, Inter Milan, are also interested.

Gerrard is free to talk to overseas clubs and agree a pre-contract next month.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has suggested he is set to spend £20 million in January.

But if the Gunners lose out to Manchester United in the race for Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels then they will have to pay £37 million for Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho.

Last week though, Wenger confirmed another Football Grapevine exclusive that the Gunners are set to offer £8m for Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings.

David Moyes is set raid former club Manchester United to bolster the squad of new club Real Sociedad.

Juan Mata is a target for Seville and may be too expensive, but Moyes could try and sign him on a loan deal.

Rafael, Phil Jones and Ashley Young are also under consideration.

Paul Scholes believes German midfielder and World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger rather than Cristiano Ronaldo should be named world player of the year.

But it is German keeper Manuel Neuer who is three man short list along with red hot favourite Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.

Scholes says: ‘All the Ballon d’Or nominees are wonderful footballers, but it’s hard to accept there is no German footballer beyond Neuer is there. Thomas Muller, Toni Kroos and Schweinsteiger were all excellent in Germany’s World Cup win, my player of the year is Schweinsteiger.’

Ronaldo is still 1-5 on, but Neuer could get the nod …he is 9-2 … Messi is 10-1.

BTW:

Louis van Gaal embarrassed himself by ranting during his press conference over speculation that Manchester United could spend a further £200m on new players. The Dutchman called it ‘disgusting’.

The United boss complained that naming names - a long list well known to readers of this column – and the sums of money involved, hindered United.

He even complained that clubs like United and Real Madrid were compromised by having to pay bigger fees for players compared to clubs like Southampton and Aston Villa and he blamed ‘press speculation’ for this.

In that respect Van Gaal is either ‘deluded’, ‘disrespectful’, or even ‘disgusting’.

The truth is, United play on their big name and big resources to attract big names. Part of that process is to leak names and numbers to lure the players. It’s part of the process.

A process which could actually be argued is ‘disgusting’.

Oh, and just to add, as a consequence of all that, Van Gaal gets paid a lot more at United than he would at either Southampton or Villa.

I Say:

I have a lot of sympathy with Nigel Pearson for lashing back at a lynch mob of Leicester fans.

Criticism and valid opinion is one thing, but vile vitriol is quite another.

After all in, the wake of a revitalised Newcastle’s 2-1 win over top of the table Chelsea what are the sinister elements of Pardew Out brigade on the Tyne saying now?
