Phil Jones will see a shoulder specialist on Wednesday following an inconclusive X-ray on the injury he picked up against Hull City.

The 22-year-old, whose World Cup dream could now be over, was forced off during the Red Devils' 2-1 victory over the Tigers on Tuesday night.

Jones went straight to hospital with his arm in a sling after being substituted off following a collision  with Hull defender Maynor
 Figueroa early in the first-half.

The
 former Blackburn defender was replaced by United captain Nemanja Vidic,
 who was making his final appearance at Old Trafford before his summer 
move to Inter Milan.

United went ahead not long after Jones' withdrawal thanks to a debut goal from youngster James Wilson.

Interim manager Ryan Giggs confirmed 
that Jones wanted to come off the pitch straight away and that the club 
were unsure of how bad the injury was.

'He has gone to hospital. We'll just have to assess it, but it didn't look great,' said Giggs on Tuesday night.

'He wanted to come straight off. Usually, as a player, you know it's something bad when you do that. Hopefully it's not too bad.'
