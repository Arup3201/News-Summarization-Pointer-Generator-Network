One of the most respected figures in the Catholic Church has launched a scathing attack on his fellow clergymen in a last ever interview published the day after his death.

The former archbishop of Milan and papal candidate Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, who died on Friday aged 85, said the Catholic Church was '200 years out of date'.

Martini, once favored by Vatican progressives to succeed Pope John Paul II and a prominent voice in the church, gave a scathing portrayal of a pompous and bureaucratic church failing to move with the times.

interview before his death on Friday

'Our culture has aged, our churches are 
big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our 
cassocks are pompous,' Martini said in the interview published in 
Italian daily Corriere della Sera.

'The Church must admit its mistakes and begin a radical change, starting from the pope and the bishops. The pedophilia scandals oblige us to take a journey of transformation,' he said in the interview.

In the last decade the Church has been accused of failing to fully address a series of child abuse scandals which have undermined its status as a moral arbiter, though it has paid many millions in compensation settlements worldwide.

Martini, famous for comments that the use of condoms could be acceptable in some cases, told interviewers the Church should open up to new kinds of families or risk losing its flock.

'radical change' or risk losing its flock

'A woman is abandoned by her husband 
and finds a new companion to look after her and her children. A second 
love succeeds. If this family is discriminated against, not just the 
mother will be cut off but also her children.'

In this way 'the Church loses the future generation', Martini said in the interview, made a fortnight before he died.

The Vatican opposes divorce and forbids contraception in favor of fidelity within marriage and abstinence without.

A
liberal voice in the church, Martini's chances of becoming pope were 
damaged when he revealed he was suffering from a rare form of 
Parkinson's disease and he retired in 2002.

In a letter marking Martini's death, 
Pope Benedict remembered him as a 'skilful teacher and preeminent 
biblical scholar,' and recalled his dedication to Christian works.

cathedral on September 1, 2012. Martini had been suffering from 
Parkinson's disease for years and his condition had degenerated last week

Martini
retired because of his age in 2002 after 22 years as head of the 
diocese, revealing at the same time that he was suffering from a form of
Parkinson's disease, which hurt his chances of becoming pope three 
years later.

Pope John Paul II was instead succeeded 
in 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI, a hero of Catholic conservatives who is 
known by such critical epithets as 'God's rottweiler' because of his 
stern stand on theological issues.

Martini's final message to Pope Benedict was to begin a shake up of the Catholic church without delay.

'The church is 200 years out of date. Why don't we rouse ourselves? Are we afraid?'

Outspoken: Cardinal Martini's liberal opinions sometimes raised the hackles of Church conservatives

A
Jesuit intellectual, Martini was reported to speak 11 languages. But 
his liberal opinions sometimes raised the hackles of Church 
conservatives.

He once told
an interviewer that even issues as controversial as birth control and 
women priests could be seen in a different light in the future.

'Certainly
the use of condoms in particular situations can constitute a lesser 
evil,' Martini said in an interview with the Italian magazine l'Espresso
in 2006.

'There is the 
particular situation of married couples in which one of the spouses is 
affected by AIDS. This person has an obligation to protect the other 
partner and the other partner also has to protect him or herself.'

The Catholic Church, which runs many 
hospitals and institutions to help AIDS victims, opposes the use of 
condoms and teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage, chastity
and abstinence are the best way to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.

It says promoting condoms to fight 
the spread of AIDS fosters what it sees as immoral and hedonistic 
lifestyles and behaviour that will only contribute to its spread.

Martini remained a prominent voice in
the Church, and in May spoke out about the leaks scandal that led to 
the arrest of Pope Benedict's butler.

Martini appealed to Church leaders to 'urgently win back the trust of the faithful' after the scandal.
After he retired from the Milan post, he spent about six years in Jerusalem, returning to his first love - Biblical studies.

After he lost the ability to swallow 
around two weeks ago, Martini refused to be fed artificially, his 
neurologist Gianni Pezzoli said.

'We saw the inexorable consequences of
his affliction, which progressively robbed him of speech, reducing it 
to a whisper that was barely audible, and of his movement,' said an 
article published on the Milan diocese's website.
