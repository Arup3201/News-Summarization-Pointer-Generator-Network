Jockey Tom Cannon will be on board The Giant Bolster again when the David Bridgwater-trained gelding attempts to win the Betbright Cup Chase at Cheltenham on Saturday for a second year running.

Cannon rode The Giant Bolster for the first time when the partnership finished just over 14 lengths behind Silviniaco Conti in the Betfair Chase at Haydock in December.

Bridgwater said of his chaser: ‘His first run (this season) at Wetherby was rubbish but his second run at Haydock was brilliant and Tom gave him a lovely ride.

'He is a very promising young jockey and it is the plan for him to ride on Saturday.

‘The Giant Bolster will definitely have a visor on. We might put a hood on as well, depending if it's cold or not, just to keep his ears warm!’

Twelve months ago The Giant Bolster beat Rocky Creek seven lengths in the Grade Two contest, formerly known as the Argento Chase, before going on to finish third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

Tom Scudamore is the jockey most associated with The Giant Bolster having ridden him in 14 of his 32 starts as well as being placed in the last three runnings of the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

This weekend, however, Scudamore looks like being needed for King George VI Chase runner-up Dynaste, trained by his boss David Pipe.

Writing on his website, Pipe said: ‘He has pleased me at home and has come out of his King George run very well. 

'We will be keeping a close eye on the weather and hoping that the temperatures keep up ahead of the weekend's action.

‘Should he participate, the result will give us yet more information on which to base his Cheltenham Festival target.’

Saturday’s race is run over nearly three and a quarter miles and Dynaste was successful at last year’s Cheltenham Festival in the two mile five furlong Ryanair Chase.

Others Betbright Cup Chase entries include Hennessy Gold Cup hero Many Clouds and Holywell, who is also entered in the Cleeve Hurdle on the same card.
