'I can't say exactly what's in it because people can be naughty with it,' explains Brandy Wright, product director and co-founder of experimental food group, The Robin Collective. 'And it's technically classified as a firearm.'

But Brandy isn't talking about bombs or guns. Instead, she's discussing the magic behind an invention called the 'chicken rocket' - a device that allows you to shoot a spoonful of stuffing across a room directly into the cavity of the bird.

It might sound bizarre but for Brandy, exploding stuffing is all in a day's work - and it's not even the most unusual method of decorating food on the Robin Collective's menu.

Extreme garnishing: The concept is the brainchild of the Robin Collective's Brandy Wright and Robin Fegen

And it's certainly not all chickens and stuffing. At 
their extreme garnishing classes, Brandy, and her partners, Robin Fegen and former child actress, Elspeth Rae, also show students how 
to create cocktails that change colour, marshmallows that double as 
medicine and bitters that taste like Charles Dickens or Alfred 
Hitchcock.

The point? To show the world how to take food to Heston Blumenthal style extremes - and beyond.

All the same, it's hard to avoid mentioning the collective's impressive dedication to things that go bang - not always with the expected result.

'When Robin first started doing the 
explosives, he tried to make a rocket sandwich where all the ingredients hang on wires before being blown together by the explosion,' reveals Brandy.

'He was testing it in the back garden and it
 just kind of went everywhere. He also had an idea to blow up plastic balls,' she continues, 'and blew 
up his hand but it wasn't so bad - he just had bruises.'

Colourful: Brandy says that pine or Christmas pudding infused 'caviar' is perfect for livening up the big day

Creative: Workshops teach extreme garnishing and how to make the colour-changing Bizarregarita cocktail

Popular: According to Brandy, Heston Blumenthal has helped make theatrical food a big trend in Britain

And while the exploding sandwich went wrong, other flammable foods made the cut and are on the curriculum at the trio's workshops.

'The chicken rocket is pretty crazy but I
 think the explosive icing was probably better because it explodes like a
 firework and its really colourful and smoky,' adds Brandy.

'Doing a flaming pineapple
with the icing is amazing but the rocket chicken can be unreliable because if something goes wrong 
then you can get stuffing all over your wall!'

While turning your turkey into the gastronomic equivalent of a land mine isn't recommended, Brandy does have some creative ideas for making December 25th go with a bang.

'Robin would probably add food colouring 
and glitter to everything,' she muses, 'whereas I'd just try and make everything bigger.

'You can do a lot with infusing,' she adds. 'Like pine infusing. Break it down and 
make a bit molecular. Fake caviar is good, pine infused or Christmas 
pudding flavoured.

'At the moment, you can go to any cocktail bar and pay £12 to £15 for a
 molecular cocktail but really, you can easily make them at home.

'The great thing about 
molecular cocktails is that they're easy and cheap and you can get guests to make them too. It's a good way of getting guests to serve themselves!'

It's this that is at the root of the Robin Collective's mission - putting creative food concepts into the public arena and showing that despite appearances, getting involved is not only doable but simple.

'The whole idea behind is by taking children's science products and making it super fun for adults,' adds Brandy.

'Heston [Blumenthal] has helped to push the idea of food combined with a theatrical production and it's really trendy now.

'It's
 just super easy and super fun, and the classes are just about showing people how easy it is
 to do things we do. I don't think it will ever go away.'

The next Extreme Garnishing workshop takes place in February. Tickets cost £40 for two people and are available from Selfridges or indytute.com

Rocket chicken and exploding icing might be off the menu (too dangerous for those who haven't been trained), but MailOnline has an exclusive recipe for those who want to make Christmas cocktails worthy of Heston Blumenthal - cheers!
