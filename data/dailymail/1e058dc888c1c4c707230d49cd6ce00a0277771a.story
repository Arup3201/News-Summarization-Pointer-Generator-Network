Year after year they trek across the globe, chasing those elusive few minutes when darkness falls within seconds as the moon comes between the earth and the sun. 

They are the eclipse chasers for whom no expense is too steep and no distance too great when it comes to pursuing their unusual hobby.

Tomorrow's total eclipse will produce a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crosses the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.

Elsewhere only a partial eclipse will be seen at best and that is why there are only two places on the planet where the real junkies want to be tomorrow morning. 

Agnese Zalcmane, a 30-year-old IT consultant from Latvia who already has four eclipses under her belt, has joined seven friends to make the trip to Svalbard, which is 800 miles from the North Pole.

Agnese saw this total eclipse in Kenya in 2013. Her family and friends think her unusual hobby 'pretty crazy'

Dr Kate Russo is an Australian eclipse chaser living in Belfast who has authored the book Total Addiction: The Life of an Eclipse Chaser. She is in the Faroe Islands for tomorrow's eclipse

She has spent upwards of 8,000 Euros (nearly £6,000) travelling to Russia, China, Australia and Kenya to capture total eclipses since her first in 2008. 

Agnese told MailOnline: 'The feeling of the eclipse when it happens, you can't describe it, it's like magic. 

'One minute the sun is shining then it starts getting darker but it doesn't get dark like it does in the evening or at dusk - it goes dark very, very fast. 

'Within half a minute it's completely black and it is something that is very strange to experience.

'It doesn't feel natural and completely understand the ancient civilizations who thought it was some sort of omen. I find it thrilling. 

'When you see it you're so happy that it was shown to you because there are so many things which can disturb it, like clouds.'

Though some of her friends and family may think she's mad, all the hassle and the expense is worth it for Agnese when the eclipse itself happens.

She said: 'That moment alone alone you feel like, "yes, we did it". All the natural power comes together when you see it and even though it's short, I am never disappointed.

'My family and some of my friends think I'm a bit crazy but every person goes crazy in their own way.

'For some people it's posh cars and for other people it's something else but for me it's eclipses.

'People pick their vacation spots for different reasons. I know a lady who goes to places where she can run marathons but I pick where to go on holiday by solar eclipses.' 

Another one of the 1,500 to 2,000 visitors who have descended on Svalbard for tomorrow's eclipse, set to begin at around 11.11am local time (1011 GMT), is Canadian Jay Anderson.  

The 67-year-old retired meteorologist will be present for his 28th eclipse, of which around 17 have been total, since he saw his first one in his native Winnipeg in 1979.  

On the hunt for eclipses for the past 36 years, he has witnessed the phenomena in Madagascar, Libya, Botswana, Mexico, Bolivia, India, Russia and China, helping to track weather patterns surrounding them for bodies including NASA.

He told MailOnline: 'In terms of reward for my travels I have seen so many go down but what else are you going to do in life? 

'You only go around once so you might as well have fun while you're doing it.

'I'm sitting here [in Svalbard] and it's -18C but it's a beautiful environment. It's cold and snowy but it's a lovely place to be.' 

Dr Russo says that seeing a total eclipse 'seems to ignite a fire that becomes a powerful driving force'

Dr Kate Russo is an Australian eclipse chaser living in Belfast who has authored the book Total Addiction: The Life of an Eclipse Chaser. 

She is in the Faroe Islands for tomorrow's event, a Danish autonomous territory that is home to 50,000 people and is expecting a surge of more than 8,000 eclipse tourists, according to tourism officials.

She has been to eight total eclipses, two annular - when the sun and moon are exactly in line, but the apparent size of the moon is smaller than that of the sun - and several partial. 

Dr Russo writes on her website:  'I will be chasing eclipses for the rest of my life.

'An eclipse chaser is someone who has made a life choice to give in to their insatiable desire to re-experience the thrill and excitement of totality. 

'Once you have seen a total eclipse, it seems to ignite a fire that becomes a powerful driving force. Eclipse chasing is not just a hobby – eclipse chasing is a way of life. 

'For me, it is like I do not have a choice about being an eclipse chaser. It has simply become something that I just do – I just am. 

'I know that for every future total eclipse, I will do all that I can to be in the shadow.'
