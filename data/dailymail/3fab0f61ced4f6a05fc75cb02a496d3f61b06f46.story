A Peruvian football team took gamesmanship to another level on Sunday as five players went down injured at the same time in a bid to get a game abandoned.

Club side Defensor Bolivar were losing 4-1, and had two men sent off, in the first leg of the Copa Peru semi-final against Defensor La Bocana before their histrionics.

With seven minutes of the game remaining, five Bolivar players fell to the ground in shocking display of foul play.

Defensor La Bocana chose to play on and scored a fifth goal as they waltzed through the remaining four ‘fit’ players.

FIFA rules dictate that a team must have at least seven players on the field to continue and therefore the referee was forced to abandon the game.

The second leg of the tie is due to be played on Thursday but there is a huge doubt whether that fixture will go ahead as the Peruvian football authorities decide whether to punish Bolivar for their misconduct.
