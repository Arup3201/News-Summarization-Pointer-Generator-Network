Oprah Winfrey is renowned for her generosity to a myriad of causes - but this time, the media mogul is spreading the wealth a little closer to home.

The chat show queen has bought her long-lost, half-sister Patricia Lofton a half a million-dollar home in Wisconsin and given her a monthly allowance so she can quit her job to go back to college and realize her dream of becoming a social worker. 

Winfrey, 60, introduced her half-sister to the world on her talk show in 2011 after first learning of her existence the year before.

Winfrey bought her sister, who has a grown son and daughter, a four-bedroom, three-bathroom property, according to RadarOnline. 

A spokeswoman for Winfrey, who once produced a reality series based on philanthropy known as Oprah's Big Give, said: 'Patricia’s greatest dream was to go to college and become a social worker. Oprah wants to support that dream.'

Winfrey, who is worth an estimated $2.9billion, was born to an unmarried, teenage mother Vernita Lee in 1956 in Kosciusko, Mississippi.

Patricia Lofton was born to Vernita Lee in 1963 while she was living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unable to cope, Ms Lee had already sent Oprah to live with her father in Nashville, Tennessee.

The luxury home has four bedrooms and three bathrooms and cost half a million

Oprah said she was happy to help the sister who found out in 2007 she was related to Winfrey but refused to sell her half-sibling out in the press

Ms Lee, who worked as a housemaid, gave up baby Patricia for adoption due to her extreme poverty. Ms Lofton stayed in foster care until being adopted at the age of seven.

Winfrey only learned she had a half-sister in 2010 and the pair met for the first time that year on Thanksgiving. She introduced Ms Lofton publicly to the world on her chat show in 2011. 

The sisters reunited after Ms Lofton saw Vernita Lee give an interview discussing her three acknowledged children and began to put the pieces together with the details of her own past.

However it took her several years to get in touch with Oprah and Ms Lofton was fearful of going public because didn't want to 'sell out' her famous sibling.

At the time, Winfrey said finding her sister 'literally shook me to my core' and added that it was 'a miracle'.
