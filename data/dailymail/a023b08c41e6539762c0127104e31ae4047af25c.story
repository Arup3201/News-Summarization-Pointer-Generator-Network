A pensioner has won the battle of Christmas decorations, by installing a giant inflatable Santa on his lawn.

The 35ft decoration towers above Steve, 68, and 61-year-old Chris Wild's bungalow in the village of Salt in Staffordshire.    

And the waving Santa - which cost £500 - is kept upright by storm-strength guy ropes, which have been hammered into the ground.

Mr Wild, a self-employed industrial contractor, said: 'It is all about tack. It cannot be tacky enough for me.

'We just do it for the fun of it really. We love it.

'You can see it from the main road on the other side of the valley. It is huge.

'Certainly, we think it is the biggest in the region, if not Britain.

'It is bigger than the house anyway.'

The couple, who have nine grandchildren, bought the decoration from a friend who never inflated it because it was too big.

The huge figure, along with a tiny light-up Christmas tree, now stands outside the couple's home for the festive season.

Mr Wild added: 'We have lived here for about 36 years. It is a smashing village.

'The reaction has been very good.

'We go to the local pub often for drinks and the quiz night and get a lot of compliments there.

'It has just been very fun. We have had lots of fun with it.'

Neighbour and amateur photographer Peter Wood, 66, snapped the Father Christmas as soon as he noticed it.

The retired headteacher said: 'I just had to take a photograph when I saw it. You can't miss it really.'

He said the Wilds have outdone themselves this year. 

'The family usually put out glamorous Christmas decorations but they have really gone for it this year,' he said.

'They've surpassed all expectations. It is quite a landmark.

He added 'I think it must be one of the biggest in Britain, certainly the region. I would certainly like someone to beat it.'

In 2011, a Christmas-mad landlord fastened a 30ft inflatable Santa to his pub roof in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.
