In the lead up to the American election this week there were a number of Mitt Romney’s Republican supporters were so keen for their man to win that they promised to emigrate to Canada if he didn’t.

With President Barack Obama elected for a second term, Fox’s station in Oklahoma gave Romney’s supporters some helpful travel advice and traffic news to get to Canada.

Fox 23’s Jeff Brucculeri used part of his 'Beat the Traffic' segment on the morning after Obama won re-election to give the helpful tips to any disheartened Republicans.

‘We had some folks make a special 
request,’ Brucculeri explained. ‘I know a lot people said that if their 
candidate lost the election, they’d be moving to Canada — not sure why, 
but that was some of the folks’ promises out there.’

The traffic anchor proceeded to give ‘the quickest and directest route’ up north, where big government, same sex marriage and universal health are a part of everyday life.Members of the newsroom could be heard laughing out of camera shot, to which Brucculeri just said: ‘“This is serious stuff.

‘When you get to Canada, you’re going to hit the border here, make sure you got either your [passport] card or your passport, OK, to get into Canada now.

‘Then you’re going to get back on 
Highway 75 in Canada or it’s actually the Lord Selkirk Highway. If 
you’re moving to Canada, you’re going to need to know this. Lord Selkirk
Highway, OK?’

While this was a light hearted segment on a news show, it seems that some people might be looking to follow through with their promise as Montreal-based immigration lawyer immigration lawyer David Cohen told CNN that he had received calls from all over America after Romney lost on Tuesday.

‘That’s the amazing thing, when they speak on the phone. They’re adamant. They feel very, very strong about it,’ Cohen said. ‘This government doesn’t speak for me’ is the language that we often hear.’
