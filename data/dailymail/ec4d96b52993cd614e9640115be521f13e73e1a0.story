Family doctors are failing to spot lung cancer until it is too late - with a third of patients diagnosed with the condition just 90 days before death.

And for one in 20 people with lung cancer, researchers discovered the disease is discovered only after they have died.

Even when patients had visited their GP repeatedly in the months before their death, lung cancer had often gone unnoticed.

GPs are often confusing the signs of cancer with maladies such as a smoker’s cough and failing to commission an x-ray.

The findings show that GPs are not picking up signs of the cancer early enough in many cases, the researchers said.

More than 35,000 people die of lung cancer in Britain each year, with just 9 per cent surviving for more than five years with the disease.

Respiratory physician Dr Emma O’Dowd, who led the research at Nottingham University, found that those who died within three months had seen their GP an average five times before they finally received a diagnosis.

Her team analysed a sample 20,140 cases of lung cancer seen at 440 GP surgeries between 2000 and 2013.

Their research, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, established that 30 per cent of lung cancer patients died within three months of a diagnosis.

Just over 10 per cent died within a month of being told they had the disease.

And for 5 per cent, there was no record of lung cancer except on the death certificate, indicating the victim never knew why they were dying.

Dr O’Dowd said the research disproves the idea that only those who neglect to visit their GP receive a late diagnosis.

She said: ‘We’re losing a lot of patients early on. I wanted to find out more about these patients who died early and if there are features that can help us to diagnose them earlier.

‘I started off with the preconception that people who died early didn’t ever see their GP. Actually, they saw their GPs more before diagnosis compared to those patients who lived longer.

‘That was a surprising finding but obviously with this piece of work we can see specifically what symptoms they have come in with.’

She found that the odds of an early death were lower among those who had received a chest X-ray.

Official NHS guidelines from NICE - the Government’s health advisory body - suggest that any patient who has a cough or hoarseness for three weeks should be sent for an urgent X-ray.

But because many of those who have lung cancer are regular smokers, the symptoms may be mistaken for a smoker’s cough, meaning the GP does not take further action.

Dr O’Dowd added that most GPs are only likely to see one new case of lung cancer a year, meaning they are not familiar with the signs of the disease.

She said: ‘Lung cancer can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from other lung diseases so we need to give them some tools that will help identify a patient as high risk.

‘If we can diagnose patients at an earlier stage hopefully they can get curable treatment rather than palliative treatment which is what most patients are getting at the moment.

‘It’s not that we’re trying to blame the GPs but if we have tools to identify these high risk people earlier than we should put them to use.’

New software is being developed for doctors that would flag up the risk of lung cancer in patients by tracking their symptoms and lifestyle.

In a linked editorial, Dr Michael Peake, consultant at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, wrote that the study showed there had been ‘missed opportunities for earlier referral’.

He added: ‘The number of excess deaths linked to deprivation is large and the gap between the least and most deprived has not lessened over time.

‘Improved targeting of public awareness campaigns to specific social groups is important so as not to widen this gap further.’

GP representatives last night tried to deflect criticism from their members, insisting that better equipment is needed.

Dr Richard Roope of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: ‘Lung cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose in primary care, especially as a key symptom is coughing, which is present with numerous other conditions that GPs see every day.

‘A full-time GP will usually see only one new case of lung cancer every year.

‘GPs are doing a good job of appropriately referring our patients that we suspect of having cancer and 75 per cent of patients found to have cancer are referred after only one or two GP consultations. ‘Taking into account the global picture, GPs across the UK are doing very well considering the meagre resources available to us.

'Funding for general practice is at an all-time low, we have a chronic shortage of doctors, and access to CT scanners, that would help in the diagnosis of lung cancer, is very limited in UK primary care.

‘Instead of criticising GPs, we need to invest in general practice to allow us to employ more GPs and support staff and to give GPs more access to technology that could ultimately save our patients’ lives.’

Only 9 per cent of lung cancer patients in the UK live for five years after they receive a diagnosis, compared with 17 per cent in the US and 13 per cent across Europe as a whole.

Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said a lung cancer patient in Britain will not survive as long as they do in other countries.

She said: ‘The finding that one in three UK lung cancer patients dies within three months of diagnosis is sadly a very telling consequence of late presentation and delayed diagnosis.

‘These are major reasons why lung cancer continues to be the biggest cancer killer in the UK, and why survival rates in this country lag behind those throughout Europe and the US.

‘Evidence suggests that well-funded awareness campaigns are proving very successful in increasing earlier diagnosis. A continuation and expansion of such campaigns will be crucial if we are to significantly improve lung cancer survival.

‘Furthermore, it is no coincidence that survival rates have improved so much faster for diseases such as breast cancer, which has long received far greater research investment. It’s time we start seeing the same levels of investment into lung cancer research and stop treating it like the poor relation.’
