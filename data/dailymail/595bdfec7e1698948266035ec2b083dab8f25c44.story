Britain's cheeriest lollipop man has been banned from dancing and giving 'high fives' to schoolchildren.

Council bosses have ordered Nkosana Mdikane, 74, to stay still so motorists can see him, despite his merry singing and dancing brightening the mornings of hundreds of pupils and parents.

Mr Mdikane was previously hailed by West Dunbartonshire Council for his 'excellent service' outside Aitkenbar Primary School in Dumbarton.

Banned: Council bosses have ordered Mr Mdikane, 74, to stay still so motorists can see him

But now the local authority have told him that all lollipop men must 'remain static with one hand on their stick and the other stretched outwards'.

Mr Mdikane, who has held the road safety job since 2013, said he respected his employer's decision but hoped the rules would be changed.

'The council is stopping me from high-fiving the kids while on duty,' he said.

'I never saw any problem in that. I'm just doing my job, but this is very emotional and affecting me.

'This issue was raised by the kids themselves. They said I can't give them any more high fives. They cannot take it and I don't like to see them upset.

'I'm respecting the decision and haven't done it since I found out. I've agreed to stop.

'I have been doing this for about two years and all of a sudden I have to stop. They [the council] should revise their decision. They need to listen to the community.'

Before moving to Scotland from Vereeniging, South Africa, in 2003, Mr Mdikane worked as a delivery driver and a chauffeur.

He and his wife Zoli, 73, a former nurse, were looking forward to retirement, but when his neighbour told him a position as lollipop man was available, he jumped at the opportunity. 

He said: 'This job is exciting. It's the best job I've ever had.

'It has taken away the frustration and loneliness of being retired. I can't be watching TV - that is too dull.'

The decision by the council, which previously praised the lollipop man for his 'cheery nature', has enraged parents, who have launched a campaign page on Facebook and have started a petition to bring back Mr Mdikane's dancing.

Campaigner and father-of-three David Dufton, 36, said: 'It's a shame. It's a surprising U-turn. One minute they're saying they love him, he's a great guy and the next they're telling him he can't behave this way.

'He's a 74-year-old man and he's out there in all weathers. It's a bit unjust. I've never heard any one ever complain about him. 

'I think they have let him down a little bit. We would like the council to revise their decision. In terms of health and safety we don't see a problem. He encourages people to cross at the crossing.

'Nkosana always puts a smile on people's faces. I hope we can return the favour and put a little smile on his face with our campaign.' 

A spokeswoman for the council said: 'All patrollers are instructed when crossing children over a road to remain static with one hand on their stick and the other stretched outwards.

'This ensures that they can be seen and effectively provides a barrier between school pupils and the traffic.'
