A Michigan teen authorities believe abandoned her newborn baby on the side of a dirt road just hours after its birth acted completely ignorant as she watched her neighbors discover the child.

'She
 looked at us and she said 'I am almost 15 years old and if I ever had a
 baby, I surely would not do something like that,' neighbor 
Pam Kopp told WZZM13.

The girl, 14, who has not been identified, has yet to be hit with criminal charges.

The baby was discovered by neighbor Jeff Kopp as he walked his dog Buddy Monday morning

If she is the mother, custody will be determined by Child Protective Services after the baby is released from Gerber Memorial Hospital in Fremont.

The baby was found by neighbor Jeff Kopp as he walked his dog Monday morning.

Kopp said he would not have discovered the baby if not for his dog, Buddy, pulling him in the child's direction.

'He brought me over to about here, and there’s when I saw what (looked like) a rabbit at first,' Kopp told WOODTV.

Kopp's daughter Cathleen Neal points out the area on the side of the road where the newborn had been left on its side

Kopp realized the rabbit was really a baby when the dog reached a satellite dish about three feet off the road.

'Then it moved,' he said. 'That’s when I started yelling.'

Kopp and his family wrapped the baby in a towel to keep her from the chill and pealed the leaves from her face as they waited for paramedics to arrive.

Emergency responders found the baby's umbilical cord was still attached.

The mother has since been taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

Neighbors say the baby's unidentified mother watched as the dog found the hidden infant

Neighbors believe the young girl may have panicked.

She
 also may have been unaware of Michigan's 'safe haven' law, allowing 
people to anonymously surrender infants within 72 hours of birth as long
 as the child is left with an Emergency Service Provider.

'I know she’s a young girl, but she’s not stupid, so it really makes 
me wonder why,' said neighbor Cathleen Neal. 'It’s just really hard 
to believe. It’s really hard to believe that someone would do that.'
