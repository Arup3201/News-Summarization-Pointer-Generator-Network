An aspiring Oxbridge student who suffers from a rare condition that stops her coping with stress fears the pressure of cramming for exams could kill her.

Jennifer Lloyd's illness means instead of producing adrenalin to cope when she gets anxious, the 17-year-old's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs.

She has had to begin revising 
for exams months in advance - in the hope she will banish any last minute cramming stress 
that could trigger her disease.

Rare illness: Jennifer Lloyd, from Prestwich, Manchester, fears cramming for tests more than all of her friends - because exam stress could kill her

Jennifer suffers from Addison's disease 
which leaves her in danger of suffering a medical crisis at times of stress. If 
she doesn't receive rapid treatment, she vomits, passes out or could 
die.

The teenager, who is studying for her AS-levels, suffered a major attack that left her in hospital last summer when she was preparing for her GCSEs.

And she has even been forced to turn down interviews for Oxbridge schemes because she fears the stress of studying at the world-famous institutions away from home could be deadly.

Jennifer, from Prestwich, Manchester, said: 'It's very tough when it gets to exam season as I have to balance my time perfectly.

'The illness leaves me very tired, so my mum often finds me asleep in my books while I've been studying.

'I know I can't let myself get unnecessarily stressed out, so I have to be much more organised than my friends.

Addison's disease suffer Jennifer Lloyd studying hard in hospital for her upcoming exams

Talented student Jennifer Lloyd was diagnosed with Addison's disease as a child after her mother Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta

'As a result I have a strict schedule where, if I do an hour of revision, I have to rest for two hours before doing any more.

'It means I can be short on time so I start preparing weeks in advance of everyone else to fit everything in.

'I
 have been offered the chance to go and view Oxford and Cambridge 
Universities as part of my college's Gifted and Talented students 
programme, which is such an honour - but I just don't feel ready to move
 away yet.

The teenager with her mother Amanda: Instead of producing adrenalin to cope with stress, Jennifer's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs

Addison's affects around one in every 15,000 people and is caused by a lack of steroid hormones in the body.

These are normally produced by the adrenal gland, but damage can cause levels to drop.

The disease is normally caused by the body's own immune system turning on the adrenal gland, but cancer and tuberculosis can also trigger the condition.

The impact on the body can be significant. One steroid, called cortisol, is involved in controlling how much water there is in the body as well as helping to fight inflammation. Another, aldosterone, regulates salt and water levels and blood pressure.

Without properly-functioning adrenal glands the body cannot cope at times of stress - such as surgery, trauma or serious infection.

The condition was discovered by Dr Thomas Addison in London in 1849. Jane Austen, John F Kennedy and Osama bin Laden are all thought to have been affected.

Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, pathologists found 'almost no adrenal tissue' according to an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Now patients are treated with cheap steroid tablets.

'My college has 
been incredibly supportive - my teachers know the danger signs and can 
call my mum straight away if they think I'm getting ill.

'After
 my first week at college, I wanted to quit because the stress of 
meeting so many new people was making me ill, but my mentor, Beverley 
Jones, convinced me to stay, which I'm really grateful for.'

Jennifer
 is gearing up for AS-level exams in psychology, geography, business and
 photography, at Pendleton Sixth Form College, knowing she has to 
prepare well in advance in case Addison's disease strikes.

If she doesn't receive rapid treatment, the student suffers an Addisonian crisis where her eyes roll to the back of her head and she starts vomiting, requiring urgent hospital treatment.

Now, after a decade, Jennifer is always prepared for when a 'crisis' hits, carrying a hydro-cortisone injection at all times - and she doubles her normal medication on the run up to important exams.

She added: 'I want to be a child psychologist, but it's hard to study for exams because they're really stressful.

'I did most of my revision last year hooked up to a drip in hospital - my weight dropped to 5st10lb because my stomach stopped absorbing fats.

'I was thrilled when I managed to gain 10 A grades and two A*s though - all the stress paid off!'

Jennifer was first diagnosed with Addison's 10 years ago after her mother, Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta.

She said: 'The first time we noticed any of Jennifer's symptoms was when we were on holiday - she was eating salt straight from the shakers on restaurant tables.

'The rest of the family went a bit pink from the sun too, but Jennifer went very brown - she looked like she'd had a terrible spray tan.

'When we got home, we took her straight to the doctor's for tests, and we discovered she was craving salt because her body wasn't retaining it.

'She was diagnosed with Addison's weeks later, and in many ways it was a relief to finally know what was wrong, but the condition is hard for us all to live with.'

In 2004 Amanda started a charity, called Jenny's Pennies, which has raised £17,000 for the endocrine department at Manchester Children's Hospital in appreciation of Jennifer's care.
