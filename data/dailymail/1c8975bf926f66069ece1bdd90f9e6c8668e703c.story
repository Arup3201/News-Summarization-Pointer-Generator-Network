It encourages unknown musicians to unleash their hidden talents on members of the public.

No, this isn’t the premise for Simon Cowell’s latest TV talent contest.

Instead, it is a concept pioneered by a British artist that sees brightly-coloured pianos dotted around cities across the world and inviting people to play them.

British artist Luke Jarram created the 'Play Me, I'm Yours' project that sees brightly-coloured pianos dotted around cities across the world and inviting people to play them

The idea, which has become something of a global phenomenon since it launched in 2008, was created by Luke Jarram.

He came up with the ‘Play Me, I’m Yours’ project believing it would inspire spontaneous communication between strangers.

Mr Jarram first placed 15 pianos across Birmingham after the project was commissioned by Fierce Earth. The project becoming an instant success.

It was estimated that over 140 000 people played the pianos or listened to others play. 

Since then, more than 1,300 pianos with a simple instruction - "Play Me, I’m Yours" - have already been installed in 45 cities across the globe, reaching about six million people worldwide.

Street pianos, often renovated by other artists or local communities, have appeared in city squares, parks, bus shelters, train stations, markets, bridges, ferries, and other public places.

‘The idea for Play Me, I’m Yours came from visiting my local launderette,’ said Mr Jarram. ‘I saw the same people there each weekend and yet no one talked to one another.

‘I suddenly realised that within a city, there must be hundreds of these invisible communities, regularly spending time with one another in silence.

‘Placing a piano into the space was my solution to this problem, acting as a catalyst for conversation and changing the dynamics of a space.’
