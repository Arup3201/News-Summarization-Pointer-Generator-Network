The first to arrive was from the 73-year-old scientists and author, who suffers from motor neuron disease.

He said: 'We all look at these motivational messages like 'sell more' and 'buy more' but they can have the opposite effect.

The quotes and photographs of each of the celebrities have now been split between their new office in Southampton and a second office in Salisbury, where they have been hung on the walls of the staff seating area.

Mr Rhodes added: 'The people I chose have all made a big impact on the world and come out on top, often against great adversity.

'Their achievements have inspired me and I hope they will continue to inspire others too.
