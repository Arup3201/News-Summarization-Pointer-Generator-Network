Jose Mourinho has predicted that this season's Barclays Premier League title race will be a showdown between five teams.

The Chelsea manager expects his rejuvenated side to be in the mix come May along with the two Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool.

And, according to the 'Special One', it is this glorious unpredictability that makes England's top flight the greatest in the world.

Reunited: Mourinho will go head-to-head with Louis Van Gaal in the Premier League this season

Speaking as a BT Sport ambassador, Mourinho said: 'Why I like the Premier League so much is that at this moment, nobody knows who is going to win the title.

'I know that we want to and I know that we can, but it is the kind of competition where I can't say.

'At this moment, I think between us, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man United, Man City - who is going to be first, who is going to play in the Europa League, I don't know.'

Mourinho guided Real Madrid to the La Liga title in 2012 but admitted the annual two-horse title race in Spain was a turn off.

He said: 'My concept is this is the best league, because the concept is competitive teams.

'When I was in Spain and we won the league we won every game. The league was decided by games against Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Convinced: Mourinho does not believe that La Liga is a top league

Competitive: Mourinho will be hoping his second season back in English football is better than his first

'Is this a top league? Not for me.

'My time in Spain was about two big clubs - not more than that. Here, the beginning is different.'

After finishing third to champions Manchester City and Liverpool last season, Mourinho has moved quickly to strengthen his squad for another title charge.

He has splashed a combined £48m on Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa and left-back Filipe Luis, and £29m on Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas.
