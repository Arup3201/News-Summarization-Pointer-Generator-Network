More than half of British pilots have fallen asleep in the cockpit of a passenger plane.

And alarming research has revealed that one in six commercial pilots has woken up at the controls - only to see that their co-pilot is dozing too.

The findings were revealed yesterday, following reports that two pilots fell asleep on a British passenger plane last month.

In the air: The captain and co-pilot of the Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 
blamed their long shifts for falling asleep but the CAA accepts the pair were not asleep at the same time

The captain and co-pilot of the Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 blamed their long shifts.

Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic 
admitted its plane was involved, but denied reports that both pilots 
were asleep at the same time.

A
 spokesman said the captain and co-pilot were sleeping in alternate 
20-minute intervals – an approved practice known as ‘in-flight napping’.

A Civil Aviation Authority report stated ‘pilots asleep’ but the company says the issue was about fatigue. The incident was logged after one 
of the pilots reported it.

However today the CAA said in a statement: 'Following clarification from the airline concerned, the CAA is satisfied that while this was a reportable event, and both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately, they did not fall asleep at the same time.

'It was right that the airline reported this to us after one of the pilots raised their concerns. The airline is now taking steps to adjust its rostering arrangements for flight crew.'

The CAA described it as an isolated incident, and experts said passengers’ lives were not at risk because the plane would have been on auto-pilot. 

Airlines involved in safety alerts are not normally identified – so as not to discourage them from reporting future incidents and risking negative publicity.

The Civil Aviation Authority does not name the airlines involved in its Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme as it relies on the honesty of firms and their crews to highlight concerns.

Airlines are legally obliged to report any potential safety breaches to the CAA while individual crew members can also report incidents.

But critics argue that passengers have the right to know which airlines are involved as it could influence their decisions about booking flights.

A CAA spokesman said: ‘We don’t identify airlines because that would potentially impact on future reporting.

‘We have MOR so that people can feel comfortable reporting concerns, and so any risks can be mitigated. The idea is that the industry can learn from these reports, not so that someone  can apportion blame.’

A CAA report said the crew were ‘suffering from symptoms of severe fatigue’.

It
 added: ‘Both members of flight crew had only five hours sleep in two 
nights due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep.
 Both crew rested for 20-minute rotations and fell asleep.’

The CAA has recorded two previous 
incidents of pilots falling asleep in the cockpit.

However, the British 
Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said the industry regulator only 
recorded episodes that were reported – and warned that pilots fell 
asleep with alarming regularity.

The union, which represents three-quarters of pilots in the UK, said demanding flight schedules and busy airline rotas were to blame.

Research by Balpa found that half of all pilots said tiredness was ‘the biggest threat to flight safety’.

Some 56 per cent said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit. Of those, 29 per cent – about one in six of all pilots – said they woke up to find their co-pilot was also asleep.

The research was carried out ahead of a European Parliament vote on EU rules for flying hours, which takes place on Monday.

Balpa
 warns the new regulations will put lives at risk as they will legalise 
shift patterns that could see pilots kept awake for up to 24 hours.

Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic admitted its plane was involved, but denied reports that both pilots were asleep at the same time. Sir Richard is pictured last week at London's Royal Albert Hall

In its poll of 500 pilots, 84 per cent
 said their flying abilities had been compromised during the past six 
months. Some 43 per cent experienced problems once a month.

Only half said their airline would back them if they refused to fly because of fatigue.

Balpa
 general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘British pilots want to make every
 flight a safe flight and tiredness is the biggest challenge they face.’

Transport ministers were warned of the dangers of sleepy pilots nine months ago, but said it was not ‘a reported flight safety issue’.

A CAA spokesman stressed that, if approved, new European rules ‘will increase our oversight role of airline operators and place firm obligations on airlines to introduce comprehensive fatigue-management policies and monitoring systems’.

A spokesman for the Department for Transport added: ‘The Civil Aviation Authority is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the EU as a whole.

‘Flight Time Limitation requirements are there to ensure that pilots and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue.’

They claimed the proposals ‘go further than current requirements, by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue’.
