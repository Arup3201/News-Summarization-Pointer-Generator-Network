Manchester City are determined to secure a move away from the Etihad for Matija Nastasic after paying £32million for Eliaquim Mangala this summer.

The Serbian has indicated a willingness to stay and fight for his place, but is surplus to requirements with Vincent Kompany, Martin Demichelis and Dedryck Boyata giving Manuel Pellegrini more than enough options at centre-back.

Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Marseille have all registered their interest in signing Nastasic and City want to strike a permanent deal rather than a loan.

Moving on?: Matija Nastasic could leave the Etihad with interest from several European clubs

Meanwhile, Micah Richards’s move to Fiorentina depends on the City defender giving his blessing to the deal after the two clubs agreed terms for him to go to Italy on loan until next summer when his contract runs out. Richards flew into Florence on Monday morning.

City are also asking for a £1million loan fee which caused West Ham to withdrawn their interest. 

While the transfer to Fiorentina is only temporary, there is a view to a permanent move.
