Exclusion zones could be set up around tourist hotspots and major public areas to stop an expected surge of Roma migrants sleeping rough and harassing passers-by with aggressive begging, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

New powers called Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) which come into operation next April will be deployed to stop gangs of homeless Eastern Europeans squatting around some of the country’s most famous landmarks and transport hubs.

The move comes as Bulgarians and Romanians are handed unrestricted working rights in the UK from January 1, prompting fears that up to 50,000 people from those countries will come here every year for the next five years.

Police have been given new powers to enforce a rough sleeping 'exclusion zone' around tourist hotspots in London

The new powers could be used to create no-go areas around Marble Arch, Park Lane and Victoria  Station – scenes of an 18-month fight to remove Roma squatters.

This proposal has been backed by Mark Field, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, who favours using the PSPOs to create an extensive no-go zone around Victoria Station, including Westminster Cathedral.

And he predicted that with the expected rise in immigration, other councils around the country would follow suit.

‘I hope that come January 1 we’re not going to have a major problem with Romanians and Bulgarians, but I think it could be quite a big problem,’ he said.

‘And it won’t be just a problem for Central London, it will apply to other parts of the country. It could become a major issue of social unrest, if we are not careful.’

Ironically Mr Field’s remarks come as he warns the Prime Minister not to ‘bang on’ about immigration because it would alienate minority ethnic voters.

But he said there was no contradiction between calling for sensible measures to combat antisocial behaviour and getting the tone right on immigration.

Councillor Nickie Aiken, head of community protection at Westminster Council, said it had struggled to stop 50-strong groups of Romanians setting up camp. And she added: ‘We’ve got a major problem now.’

David Longstaff, head of safety at Barnet Council in North London, said he would consider using PSPOs. His comments come after a group of 68 Romanians were evicted from a vermin-infested camp set up on a local football pitch in June.

He said: ‘It is a major concern  in residents’ minds that there’s going to be a major influx again.’

But a Westminster Council Spokesperson insisted no plans have yet been put in place to use PSPOS.

She said: 'Westminster Council is not planning to create 'exclusion' zones around Victoria. This piece of legislation will not come into effect until April 2014 and we will consider our options then.'

Paul Carter, leader of Kent County Council, said there had been a rise in aggressive begging, particularly coming up to Christmas.

He predicted PSPOs would ‘undoubtedly’ be used to target anti-social behaviour. Mr Carter said: ‘We do have significant pockets where migrants are presenting some problems. These powers will be exceedingly useful.’

A spokesman for the Home Office said PSPOs – part of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill currently going through Parliament – would speed up councils’ ability to stamp  out problems.

He added: ‘We are bringing in new, fast and adaptable powers to make it quicker and easier for local authorities to protect their communities while protecting the freedoms of law-abiding people.’
