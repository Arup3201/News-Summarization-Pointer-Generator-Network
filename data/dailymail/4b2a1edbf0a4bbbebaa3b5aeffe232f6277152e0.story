A free-kick in an attacking position should be a goalscoring opportunity but defenders reduce the risk by encroaching.

As soon as the ref turns his back they look to gain two yards. It drives me mad! It makes it harder to get the shot up and over the wall.

The spray used yesterday stops defenders from cheating. It has been trialled in domestic leagues in Brazil and Argentina: let’s get it into the Premier League immediately.

In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward

Cesar proves he's top class

It was good to see Julio Cesar playing last night. He is a top quality goalkeeper who had a frustrating season before leaving QPR for Toronto on loan.

He was allowed to leave to reduce the wage bill and for no other reason. He is a very talented goalkeeper and technically excellent. Let’s see what happens to him next season.

Brazil are weak on the wings

Brazil have some terrific players but they are weak in the full-back areas. Marcelo and Danny Alves want to be wingers.

They leave a lot of space behind them and teams watching them last night will look to get in on the flanks against them.

Their whole defence might be the most talented of all time, but they are so good at going forward they sometimes forget to defend!

Neymar thriving at being top dog

Neymar comes to life in a yellow No 10 shirt. He’s second in command to Lionel Messi at Barcelona but he thrives on being top dog for Brazil.

Golden boy: Neymar is thriving under the pressure of being Brazil's talisman

Two goals and he’s off and running in the Golden Boot race. But that penalty decision was horrendous, wasn’t it? A joke. A real home call. The referee looked like he couldn’t wait to give it too. I hope England don’t suffer such an abysmal decision.
