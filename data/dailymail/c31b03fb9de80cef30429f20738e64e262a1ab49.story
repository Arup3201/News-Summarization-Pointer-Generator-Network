Homeowners may be landed with huge bills if ash trees on their property are infected with killer fungus and need to be felled.

It costs up to £1,000 to have a diseased tree cut down and disposed of safely, but people will not be able to claim the cost on their home insurance.

The department responsible says there is no prospect of the Government stepping in to offer compensation to anyone affected.

The disease, ash dieback, has already been found at 29 sites across the country, threatening to scar the landscape for decades.

And now it has emerged that the crisis could hit the pockets of ordinary householders as well as farmers and landowners.

The Horticultural Trades Association, which represents garden nurseries, says it costs between £600 and £1,000 to chop down a sick tree. 

They have warned the failure of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to offer compensation could aid the spread of the disease, because there is no incentive to report infected trees on your land.

Tim Briercliffe, the HTA’s director of business development, said it was unfair that farmers whose cattle were infected by foot and mouth disease were offered compensation but there was nothing on offer to those whose trees have fallen victim.

‘We believe that the control of the  disease will be more effective if compensation is offered,’ he added.

‘People are legally obliged to report the disease but there is no incentive to do so, because if they report it they’ll be landed with a bill of up to £1,000 to remove a single ash tree.

‘If people aren’t reporting this, or are getting rid of trees on the quiet, we can’t get a grip on the disease.’ 

Farmers in West Yorkshire have been told they will have to pay for a cull – and there would be no compensation.

Paul Sykes, managing director of a 2,000-acre estate in Farnley Tyas, was ordered last Friday to destroy 1,700 ash saplings within a week.

A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘Household policies will cover damage to your property by a tree felled by a storm or flood. But any costs incurred in felling an ash tree or treatment in respect of disease is not something covered under home insurance.’

A spokesman for Defra said: ‘We believe that resources are best spent on tackling the disease.’
