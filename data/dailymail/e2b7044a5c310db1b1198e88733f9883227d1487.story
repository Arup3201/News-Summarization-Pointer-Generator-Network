Alfonso Thomas is to take over as Somerset's limited-overs captain this summer.

The South Africa-born seamer, 38, will therefore share leadership duties with former England batsman Marcus Trescothick, who will stay in charge in the LV County Championship and as club captain.

Somerset coach Matthew Maynard said: 'Alfonso has played a huge amount of T20 cricket in the last few seasons, both here and abroad.

'He has tasted success in the IPL, the BPL and the Big Bash. His experiences of the intricacies of the T20 game at the highest level make him the ideal captain for the shorter form of the game.'

Meanwhile, Somerset have signed Pakistan international Sohail Tanvir for next season's NatWest T20 Blast.

Left-arm seamers are a prized commodity in the shortest format and 30-year-old Tanvir brings plenty of experience, with 170 domestic and 42 international Twenty20 appearances.

His return of six for 14 for Rajasthan Royals in the 2008 Indian Premier League was the record bowling performance in T20 cricket until Somerset's Arul Suppiah bettered it with six for five three years later.
