A former soldier has been banned from the roads after he purposely rammed his Mercedes into the back of a family car because he was frustrated by the 'namby pamby' driver.

Stephen McDougall, 44, of Penmaenmawr, North Wales,  said he crashed into the back of the holidaymakers' car because the driver was being too cautious as he approached a roundabout.

Parents Richard and Deborah Woodhead and their two children, aged 11 and six, suffered whiplash in the crash.

Crash: Llandudno Magistrates' Court heard how McDougall smashed into the back of a family car

McDougall, a Gulf War veteran, sped off after the rear-end smash but Mrs Woodhead noted down his registration plate and phoned the police.

He was tracked down and told officers: 'The other car was being all namby pamby and braking far too early for the roundabout so I rammed into him.'

The Woodhead family were driving on the A55 in Llanfairfechan, North Wales, when they were hit by impatient McDougall.

Prosecutor Tracey Willingham said: 'Mr Woodhead approached a roundabout and started to brake in order to get around it.

'McDougall collided with Mr Woodhead’s car and shunted it forward.

'The Woodhead children suffered whiplash to their necks and backs and Mrs Woodhead had a hand injury from hitting the dashboard. But the defendant drove on.'

Mrs Woodhead noted McDougall’s number plate, rang 999 and officers traced him to a nearby nature reserve.

Llandudno magistrates heard McDougall had 58 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the limit is 35mg.

McDougall admitted drink driving, driving without due care and attention, and failing to stop at an accident.

McDougall was fined £110 for drink driving and given a 16-month driving ban.

He was also fined £75 for failing to stop at an accident and £40 for careless driving.
