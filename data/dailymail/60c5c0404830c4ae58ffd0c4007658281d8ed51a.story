A sheriff's deputy who beat up his father after he caught him having sex with his wife appeared before a police disciplinary hearing on Wednesday and received a four-year suspension from the force.

Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, of Moab, Utah, assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he allegedly found him having sex with his wife Logan in their son's bed last July.

Later that day, Brewer also hit an officer who was trying to keep him from going to the hospital where his father was being treated.

Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, of Moab, Utah, appeared before a police disciplinary hearing on Wednesday and received a four-year suspension from the force after he assaulted his father and another officer last July

On Wednesday he appeared before the Utah Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Council and begged them to let him keep his badge.

‘I regret it every day since this incident happened, when I walked upstairs and saw what I saw,’ said an apologetic Brewer. ‘This is the second-worst day of my life.’

In the criminal case, Brewer had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of assault and assault against a police officer and was sentenced to 24 months probation.

Brewer managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote.

Instead of revoking his it, as had been recommended, the POST Council voted 6-5 to suspend Brewer for four years

Following the suspension, he will have to go back through the police academy if he wants to wear a badge again.

'There’s no doubt in my mind that his actions at the house that day were justified. I believe that practically anybody would have done similarly at the house,' said Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds, a member of the POST Council.

'Where Mr. Brewer loses me is when he goes back to the hospital.'

Brewer had asked for the opportunity to work in law enforcement again, asking that he be given a suspension instead of revocation. 

Happier times: TJ Brewer allegedly found his wife Logan Brewer having sex with his father in their son's bed

He assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky'
 Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he found him having sex 
with his wife Logan in their son's bed. 

The assaults happened on July 11 when Brewer invited his father over for dinner.

According to police reports,  Brewer cooked dinner for the trio before his wife went to put one of their children to bed.

After she did not return, he went upstairs to check and allegedly found her 'on top of his dad' on their son's bed. Brewer then fought with his father and his wife raced to her parents' house.

Wesley Brewer then returned to his own home 'to find a firearm'.

However when his 
distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Wesley Brewer allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two 
times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'.

Family: TJ Brewer, pictured with his wife Logan and their children, managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote

He was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital and eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. 

The father and son were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer 
family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s 
deputies.

TPM reported that TJ then went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s
 deputy, in the parking lot.

When police arrived, an intoxicated TJ wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several
 times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish
 the job'.'

Police wrote in their report: 'TJ
 made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about 
all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated that we needed to
 call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.'

He then assaulted a police officer, before he was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two 
counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police 
officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers.

Due to the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a 
peace officer.

The Utah Attorney General prosecuted the case rather than the local 
district attorney.

Since his arrest, Brewer has resigned as sheriff's deputy at the Grand County Sheriff’s Department.

His father also resigned from the fire department where he had been
 chief since 1989.
