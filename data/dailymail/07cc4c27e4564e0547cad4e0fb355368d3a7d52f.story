A Boeing Dreamliner jet has been forced to make an emergency landing shortly after taking off on a flight from Denver to Tokyo.

The United Airlines flight was diverted to Seattle as a precaution yesterday when pilots were alerted to a problem with the plane's oil filter.

The incident will heap further embarrassment on Boeing, which has seen the Dreamliner get off to a troubled start by being grounded for several months thanks to overheating in its battery.

It is not believed that yesterday's emergency landing was connected to the battery problems previously experienced by the jet.

The flight safely landed at Seattle airport with no further incidents.

'United flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo diverted to Seattle due to an indication of a problem with an oil filter,' United said in a statement.

'The aircraft landed normally and without incident and we are working to re-accommodate customers.'

The 787 Dreamliner, the first carbon-fibre aircraft made by Boeing, was hotly anticipated in the aircraft industry, but its development has been plagued with troubles.

The jet was launched three years behind schedule, and was first delivered to airlines in 2011.

However, in January this year the entire fleet of Dreamliners worldwide was grounded after two planes were forced to make emergency landings within the space of a week.

The problem was traced to the jets' lithium-ion batteries, which were only declared safe last month.

The latest emergency landing will cast more doubt on the future of the 787, which faces stiff competition from the forthcoming Airbus A350.

Nonetheless, airlines such as British Airways and Thomson Airlines have bought the planes in an attempt to reduce the cost of fuel.
