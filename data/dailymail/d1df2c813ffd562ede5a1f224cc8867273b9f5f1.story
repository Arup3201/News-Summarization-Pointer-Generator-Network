Former primary school teacher Martyne Airey has been told he could face jail after sniffing pupil's feet for 'sexual gratification'

A primary school teacher is facing jail after playing games of 'sniff and tickle' with his pupils' feet.

Martyne Airey, 51, told misbehaving children to stay behind after lessons and take off their shoes and socks before sitting them up at a table and smelling their toes or tickling their soles.

He was caught after several pupils - all boys - were confronted by other teachers for being late to their classes. They explained that they had been with Airey and said what had happened to them.

It emerged in court that Airey would get the pupils to pick a playing card from a deck. Depending on which card was picked he would then sniff or tickle their feet. He was suspended from his position before being charged in April this year.

The court heard that the pupils have not reported any trauma from the incidents, but 'just thought he was weird'.

Prosecutors said Airey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, carried out the offences for 'sexual gratification'.

He pleaded guilty to eight counts of sexual activity with a child under 13 at Preston Crown Court and will be sentenced next month.

At an earlier hearing before magistrates, prosecutor Miss Catherine Allan said: 'The defendant was working as a teacher at a school.

'The prosecution case is that he would play a game with children which involved him smelling their feet for sexual gratification. There is abuse of position, of trust, the age of children, numerous children.'

At the latest hearing, prosecutor Miss Abigail Hudson said: 'Three of the boys came back from Mr Airey's class and were asked why they were late and, at that point, disclosed the game they had been playing.

'The 
parents made this public and other parents asked their children if they 
had played this game too. None of the children were particularly 
disturbed, they just thought it was weird. The parents were of course 
more perturbed.'

Airey was caught after pupils told other teachers what he had been doing when he kept them back

After the court hearing, a parent of one of the pupils said: 'It was not normal behaviour. I was really angry and disgusted when it all came out. I'm just glad he has pleaded guilty and the children will not have to be put through another ordeal.

'Lots of us were really concerned over whether he would plead guilty so it is a real relief.'

Another said: 'You normally expect your children to be safe with their teacher, but this fellow obviously needs some help. Parents in the playground have talked of nothing else except what he did.'

Airey - who was given bail on condition he does not to have any contact with any children under 16 - was told by Judge Simon Newall that a jail sentence could not be ruled out.

But, the judge said, his early guilty plea would be taken into account as it had helped to avoid a long trial.
