Keen Black Friday shoppers will have 
the opportunity to stock up on bargains a day earlier than normal with 'Gray 
Thursday' stores set to open on Thanksgiving across the country.

Traditionally
shoppers were able to barge into stores early the morning after turkey 
day but this year stores such as Kmart which will be open from 6am today
and open for 41 hours straight in 'the triple doorbuster' sale to 
appease bargain hunters.

Other stores including Best Buy and Walmart will be open from 6pm on Thanksgiving while Target, Macy's and Sears will open at 8pm.

The early bird: Stores set to open on Thanksgiving, dubbed 'Gray 
Thursday.' Pictured are eager shoppers Jonas Allooh (right) who set up camp 
on Monday last week with Tony Avitar (left) for the Best Buy Black 
Friday sale in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio

Some consumers criticized retailers for opening so early on the holiday but Kmart said it had made the decision in response to customer feedback.

According to ABC, the company said in a statement: 'We understand many associates want to spend time with their families during the holiday.

Bargains include:

'With
this in mind Kmart stores do their very best to staff with seasonal 
associates and those who are needed to work holidays. All associates who
work on Thanksgiving are compensated with holiday pay.'

Some customers took to social media, calling Kmart's decision 'heartless' and 'greedy'.

Tents started to pop up in front of some stores up to ten days before the sales to be first through the doors.

Identical
triplet brothers in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio were the first to get in line 
for Black Friday sales when they set up a camp outside the local Best 
Buy Monday afternoon, a full ten days before Thanksgiving.

Jonas
Allooh and his two brothers have been camping out for Black Friday 
deals for the past four years, but were tired of always being second in 
line. This year, they made it a point to get out earlier to be the 
first.

Tradition: Mr Allooh has been camping out for Best Buy Black Friday sales for the past four years

Urban camping: Mr Allooh and his group take shifts waiting in line, so that everyone can get a shower in. But waiting in line is hardly boring, since they've got all the comforts of home in their 10-person tent

And
the Allooh brothers aren't the only ones. Already, another local has 
struck up a tent next to them and others across the country are setting 
up tents outside of other Best Buy locations in hopes of saving on 
Christmas presents. How much is uncertain, as Best Buy hasn't even 
published its Black Friday flyer yet. 

'I have plenty of time to look at the flyer,' Mr Allooh told USA Today.

For
the next week, Allooh and his brothers will take shifts in the tent so 
someone is there at all times, and they all have time to get showers in.

Waiting in line is hardly a hardship though, since they have all the comforts of home.

Inside their 10-person tent they've got a queen-sized mattress, microwave, TV, computer and five space heaters.

Napping allowed: No one will be sleep deprived, thanks to the five heaters that keep the tent warm and the cozy queen-sized mattress

Entertainment: It's never a dull moment for Allooh and his friends, since they've got a TV and computer to keep them entertained in the tent

Mr Allooh is able to take the time to wait in line since he's unemployed. He recently graduated from Kent State University with a doctorate in audiology.

While Mr Allooh is hoping to get a computer monitor for himself, and a present for his mom, saving money is just part of the reason he's been camping out the last four years. He genuinely enjoys the experience and left his tent last year right before doors opened to do his shopping online at home. 

Shortly after putting up his tent, the man who's usually in line pitched up next door.

Tony Avitar has been camping out for Black Friday even longer than Mr Allooh. He started seven years ago, before people got the 'bright idea' to bring tents.

Pro: Mr Avitar has been camping out for the past seven years, and remembers one particularly bad year where there was freezing rain for sixteen hours and he only had a sleeping bag

He remembers the second year he camped out, he slept in a sleeping bag on the sidewalk during sixteen hours of freezing rain.

'I wanted to stop three or four years ago, and my kids mae me do it because they like coming down,' Mr Avitar told Fox 8. 'We usually have Thanksgiving brought to the tent, so we'll have a full spread in the tent, and it's kind of my time with them.'

Also a little annoyed that he wasn't the official first person in line is Robert Prine, who set up his camp outside of a Best Buy Wednesday afternoon in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

Mr Prine decided to wait in line in order to get away from it all before the start of the hectic holiday season.

'I wanted a vacation from everybody and everything so I decided Black Friday was the perfect vacation for me,' he told WITN.

Loner: Robert Prine decided to camp out for Black Friday this year as a way to get a vacation away from 'everybody and everything'

But he too enjoys the sense of community created by the Black Friday camps

'How often in America do you get to sit down with your neighbors and your friends, and camp out and be good neighbors and look out for one another?' he said.

Victoria Torres set up her camp outside a Best Buy in Beaumont, California last Monday but waits in line more out of practicality.

'When we need something and we can't afford it, we comeout on Black Friday because they've got the good deals,' Ms Torres said.

'It gets a little cold, but it's worth it.'
