In the wake of England’s humiliating defeat against New Zealand on Friday, exiled batsmen Kevin Pietersen posted a timely video of himself enjoying a holiday in Barbados. 

England were whipped out for 123 in Wellington as Tim Southee produced a vintage display of swing bowling to return seven for 33 - the best figures by a New Zealand bowler in one-day internationals.

The Black Caps then raced to the target in just 12.2 overs, on the back of Brendon McCullum's whirlwind 77 from 25 balls.

Pietersen, who has been sunning himself at the plush Westmoreland luxury resort, posted a video to his Twitter account with the caption 'Sun, pool, sea, sand...loving @RoyalWM this week! #Barbados'. 

Pietersen seems to be making a habit of posting clips shortly after England defeats. He posted a similar video last week following England's defeat against Australia.

'Top bombing,' he wrote alongside side another swimming pool dive as England suffered an 111-run defeat to World Cup co-hosts Australia.

The 34-year-old will undertake commentary duties with BBC's Test Match Special from the quarter-final stage onwards and it remains to be seen whether he will be running the rule over the England side.
