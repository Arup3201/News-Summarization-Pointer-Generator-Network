A lifelong friend of Andy Rooney has reportedly suffered a heart attack at a memorial service for the 60 Minutes presenter and is currently in intensive care.

The incident happened around lunchtime today at the Century Club in New York City, where a lunch was being held as part of the memorial service.

The roommate, Bob Ruthman - who studied at Colgate University with Mr Rooney in the 1940s - was attending the event in a wheelchair when he suffered a heart attack, according to TMZ.

He was revived by paramedics at the club and is currently in a New York hospital recovering.

According to TMZ, the late Mr Rooney's son Brian had mistakenly announced to the crowd that Mr Ruthman had died.

There was no comment from the Century Club when contacted by MailOnline.

Mr Ruthman, a lifelong friend of Mr Rooney, is also thought to be a writer who is originally from Norwalk, Connecticut.

The Century Association is an exclusive private members club in Manhattan which was established in 1847.

Andy Rooney died on November 4, only a month after delivering his 1,097th and final televised commentary.

Rooney had gone to the hospital for an undisclosed surgery, but major complications developed and he never recovered.

Rooney talked on '60 Minutes' about 
what was in the news, and his opinions occasionally got him in trouble.

But he was just as likely to discuss the old clothes in his closet, why 
air travel had become unpleasant and why banks needed to have important 
sounding names.

He won one of his three Emmy Awards 
for a piece on whether there was a real Mrs Smith who made Mrs. Smith's
Pies. As it turned out, there was no Mrs Smith.

'I obviously have a knack for getting 
on paper what a lot of people have thought and didn't realise they 
thought,' Rooney once said. 'And they say, 'Hey, yeah!' And they like 
that.'

Looking for something new to punctuate
its weekly broadcast, '60 Minutes' aired its first Rooney commentary on
July 2, 1987.

He complained about people who keep track of how many 
people die in car accidents on holiday weekends. In fact, he said, the 
Fourth of July is 'one of the safest weekends of the year to be going 
someplace.'

More than three decades later, he was 
railing about how unpleasant air travel had become. 'Let's make a 
statement to the airlines just to get their attention,' he said. 'We'll 
pick a week next year and we'll all agree not to go anywhere for seven 
days.'

In early 2009, as he was about to turn
90, Rooney looked ahead to President Barack Obama's upcoming 
inauguration with a look at past inaugurations. He told viewers that 
Calvin Coolidge's 1925 swearing-in was the first to be broadcast on 
radio, adding, 'That may have been the most interesting thing Coolidge 
ever did.'

For his final essay, Rooney said that he'd live a life luckier than most.

'I wish I could do this forever. I can't, though,' he said.
