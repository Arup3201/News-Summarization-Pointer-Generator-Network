Amanda Knox has spoken out against the 'bad vibes' the notorious photo of her kissing former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito created in the days following the death of her housemate Mereditch Kercher.

The image was taken as police searched the flat that she had shared with the British university student, who was found with 47 wounds, including a fatal slash across her throat, at their Perugia home in November 2007.

Sollecito had been dating Knox in Italy for just one week when the couple came under investigation for her murder.

The moment that Miss Knox said created 'bad vibes' for her and her boyfriend, whose sex life and drug habits made headlines throughout their trial

She went on to serve four years for 
her murder before being acquitted in an appeals court in
2011 due to insufficient evidence.

Then two months ago, Italy’s highest court overturned that decision and ordered a new trial to begin within the next year - raising the prospect that she could be jailed once more.

Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found 
all over the crime scene, is currently serving a 16-year prison sentence for the murder.

Knox, 25, said told The Times that the infamous kiss - caught on camera by the press - created 'bad vibes' for her.

She said: 'That video [outside the house] was cut 
and repeated so that all you see is a loop of me and Raffaele kissing 
over and over again.'

The photograph was held up as proof of her alleged sinister sexual nature.

In
fact, Knox has revealed that the kiss 
was an act of comfort in the face of fear and uncertainty.

She said: 'I just felt incredibly lost and I was 
sad and I was trying to understand, and Raffaele kissed me to console me
because our language barrier prevented us from really being able to 
console each other with words.'

Miss Knox is on a media tour to promote her memoir Waiting to be Heard. She spoke to the Times about the public perception of her as a sinister woman

Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito has released his own memoir of his experience in jail. Italian prosecutors accused Sollecito and Knox of killing Kercher in a sexual escapade that went awry

Knox's behaviour during the police search, in which she didn't cry and was said to hug and kiss her boyfriend, was pursued by the media as a reason to suspect the 20-year-old of murder.

Knox's memoir, Waiting to be Heard, has not been published in the UK but has reignited a media storm around the Kercher case.

Knox received a grilling from various U.S. media outlets following the release of the book on April 30.

Earlier this month she told CNN's Chris Cuomo that despite her characterization in the Italian media as a sexual deviant, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games.

Knox was adamant as she told Cuomo: 'I've never taken part in an orgy - ever.'

She said she was shocked during the trial, when lawyers for the prosecution were calling her a 'whore' and a 'deviant.'

She says that Italian prosecutors made up allegations that she was a sex and drug-crazed party girl to bolster their case.

Knox said that her book is aimed at debunking those criticisms.

She said: 'In the book I talk about all my sexual experiences... I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip.'

Knox added: 'No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, no witnesses have ever come out saying things like that.'

She also told Cuomo that now that she's home in Washington, she doesn't go to parties - and no longer smokes cannabis.
