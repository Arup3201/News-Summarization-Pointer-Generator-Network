Luxury cruise firm Cunard have released an animated timeline of its illustrious history to mark the 175th anniversary of the company.

The video details various key moments, from Cunard's first scheduled transatlantic crossing in 1840 to its role in World War I.

The shipping company was also the first steel ship to use electric light bulbs on board.

Its ships pioneered wireless transmission at sea took at the turn of the 20th century, while they also operated the first round-the-world cruise in 1922.

The company, founded by Sir Samuel Cunard, made its maiden transatlantic voyage in 1840 when the Britannia sailed from Liverpool to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The video also documents Cunard’s participation in WWI, including the loss of 20 ships from the fleet when they were deployed between 1914-1918.

Winston Churchill estimated that its famous vessels the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth helped to shorten the Second World War by at least a year; fundamentally due to the large troop-carrying capacities of the ships.

Upon the end of the war, Cunard regained its position as the largest Atlantic passenger line after falling behind to US competitors, and by the mid-1950s operated twelve ships to the United States and Canada.

As well as being called upon at time of crisis, the animation also details how Cunard played its part in the world of fashion and glamour as many of the world's most iconic movie stars graced the Promenade Deck of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth in the 1950s.

After 1958, transatlantic passenger ships became increasingly unprofitable because of the introduction of jet airliners.

However, Cunard has remained one of the most popular cruise liner companies in the world.

The video ends with an image of the ‘three queens’ - Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria and Queen Mary 2. 

The three ships are set to meet in Liverpool in May 2015, before a series of events will be held across the city on Saturday July 4 – the same day that Cunard flagship Queen Mary 2 sets sail for America from Liverpool Cruise Terminal, recreating the original voyage of Britannia.

Angus Struthers, Cunard's marketing director said: ‘For those unfamiliar with Cunard, it's difficult to comprehend how much of a role the company has played in shaping the world of ocean travel as we know it today.

‘This year is our 175th anniversary and we are proud to be able to showcase everything we have achieved in this time. 

'We have so much planned for 2015, including events across the globe which we hope as many people as possible will join us for and take their place in our history books too.’
