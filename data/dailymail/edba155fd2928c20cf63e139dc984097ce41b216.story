A Utah mother, who shot dead her 18-year-old daughter but failed in an attempt to kill herself in a suicide pact, agreed to a plea deal yesterday.

Mary Ethyl Hansen, 43, was originally charged with first-degree felony murder.

She pleaded guilty, but mentally ill to charges of manslaughter and discharging a firearm in court, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

Virginia Ray Hansen's body was found in a bedroom at the West Jordan home she shared with her mother on March 22 last year.

Shot dead: Mary Hansen shot her daughter, Virginia Ray, twice in the head on March 22 before turning the gun on herself. She claimed her daughter wanted to die. The two are pictured here, years earlier

She was shot twice in the head. Hansen then turned the gun on herself but did not die of the injuries.

She drove to a neighbor's house and told her what had happened and paramedics were sent to the home.Â 

She later told police it was a suicide pact and she and her daughter had both planned to die.

Officials said she later tried to commit suicide in jail.

'Ms. Hansen recklessly shot her daughter twice with a handgun, causing her death,' defense attorney Heidi Buchi said, according to the report.

Friends have reportedly told the newspaper that Hansen had health and financial problems at the time of the shooting.

Virginia Ray was described a quiet girl with few friends who barely left her mother's side.

'They were all [that] each other had,' a friend told the Tribune at the time of the shooting.

She is currently being held in Salt Lake County Jail but is due to be committed to Utah State Hospital so her mental state can be evaluated further.

She will be sentenced on May 8 and faces prison for up to 15 years.
