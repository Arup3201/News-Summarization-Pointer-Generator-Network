The good old days: Debbie (left) and Kito were inseparable before he went missing

A dedicated pet owner who lost her beloved dog two years ago is offering a staggering £10,000 reward just to find out what happened to him.

Animal lover Debbie Spalton has spent more than £6,000 delivering thousands of leaflets, knocking doors and flying back and forth from her Dubai home to find her dog Kito.

She has even got the attention of pet care retail giant Pets At Home and celebrity vet Joe Inglis.

Mrs Spalton is now also getting help from former 
policeman turned pet detective Tom Watkins, as well as trying animal 
psychics and tracker dogs.

And now with Tom's help she's 
even got a video van - usually used in police MISSING PERSON searches - 
to drive around the Midlands beaming video footage of her lost dog.

After getting the Rhodesian Ridgeback
as a puppy in 2004 Debbie had the heartache of leaving him in the UK on
a farm with friends after she married her pilot husband and moved to 
the Middle East.

The former helicopter instructor knew Kito wouldn't have a life in her 23rd floor apartment or be 
able to cope with 50C summer heat so found him a 'doggy heaven' on a 
farm in Rugeley, Staffs.

But on August 7 2010 Kito disappeared 
from the farm a day after he'd gone missing for several hours before 
returning 'agitated' and 'glad to be home'.

Mrs Spalton still fights back the tears talking about her 'baby' and said the reward was for any information that would let her know what has happened to him.

The 55-year-old, who lives with Emirates pilot husband Rupert, said using the video van - which toured the Midlands on Friday - was her final push to find Kito who now would be around 11 years old.

She said: 'For people who think it's "just a dog" I would say he was my baby, he and dogs like him are part of the family, he used to sleep on my bed.

'When I had to move to Dubai it was heart-breaking leaving Kito behind but our friend Sian and her family had a farm and I knew him living there would be much more dog friendly than a 23rd floor apartment and 50 degree heat, it was 'doggy heaven'.

Part of the family - Kito had finally settled down with his new owner Sian on the farm in Rugeley, Staffs

'Rhodesian Ridgebacks are very loyal friendly dogs, they were bred to protect farms in Africa so they are protective but Kito is the most loving dog.

'When I went to Dubai Kito was welcomed into a lovely home where he was loved and cared for for six years - longer than he was with me.

These are just some of the extreme lengths Debbie Spalton went to in order to find her dog...    

'They took him in and he was their beloved boy. Sian in particular was devastated when he went missing from under her nose, he was her best friend.

'On the farm he would always be close to Sian guarding her, then the day before he went missing they couldn't find him for several hours and when he did come back he was agitated and very glad to be home it seemed.

'He disappeared the next day. I now think his behaviour the day before could have been because someone had befriended him and kept him somewhere perhaps in preparation to take him away.

'I feel like I have let him down, I know £10,000 is a lot of money and it's all the savings I have.

'The reward is because I need to know what has happened to Kito, he might still be suffering now, he might be dead, we need to know.

'The reward is for any information, we just need to get some closure.'

When Kito first went missing Mrs Spalton flew back to the UK and met with Tom Watkins - a former policeman turned pet detective - who runs the UK's biggest missing pet service Animal Search UK.

Mrs Spalton added: "Tom has been amazing, he helped me organise the search for Kito and we have never given up.

'Tom has even agreed to drive the 
video van around for next to nothing, this could be the final push to 
find Kito as he would be getting older now.'

When
Kito went missing he a missing lower front tooth, a scratched face from
a previous altercation with a badger and a scarred tip of his right 
ear. He is also chipped.

Pet detective Tom Watkins said Debbie's determination and the lengths she has gone to find Kito were the most he has ever seen.

He
said: 'What Debbie has done to find Kito is remarkable and a real 
testament to love she has for him, she has spent thousands and even 
flown back to the UK to search for him.'
