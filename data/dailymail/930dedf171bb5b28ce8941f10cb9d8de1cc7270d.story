The world's oldest tailor is closing its doors after more than 400 years in men's fashion as it struggles to keep up with online prices.

Tissimans in Bishop's Storford, 
Hertfordshire, which is thought to be the oldest clothes store in the 
world, will shut its doors for the last time later this month and begins
its closing-down sale on Friday.

Manager Freddy Cole, 22, who has run the store on behalf of his father for the past six years, said the family can no longer afford to keep it open.

Its struggles stem from a combination of shoppers being able to find cheaper alternatives online and men's fashion becoming less formal.

The recent closures of the Pearsons department store and Clement Joscelyne furniture shop in the town has also reduced precious footfall in the town.

Mr Cole told The Independent On Sunday: 'A lot of people have come out of the woodwork since we said were closing but where were they during the past five years?'

He added: 'I see people come in, try on stuff, and then I never see them again. They find websites selling things cheaper than I can afford.'

The shop began trading as Slaters in 1601 and was bought by its current owners, who run menswear shops in Uckfield and Epping, six years ago.

History books show the tailor supplied goods to many aristocratic homes, including Sandringham, over the centuries.

Other customers have included the renowned 20th Century sculptor Henry Moore, and writer Dr Samuel Johnson's servant, Francis Barber, who bought his employer a hat there in 1769.

Trevor Tucker, who runs a fish stall just yards from Tissimans on the High Street, said: 'We have been here nearly 40 years and I've seen this town die, literally die.'

Tissimans sells formal and casual menswear and also offers personal tailoring and hire services.

A statement on its website said: 'We would like to thank all our customers over the years and apologise for any inconvenience caused by this sad news.'
