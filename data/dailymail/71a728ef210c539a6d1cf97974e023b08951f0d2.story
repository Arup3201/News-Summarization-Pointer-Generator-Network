Euro judges yesterday deprived convicts and their no-win, no-fee lawyers of a seven-figure payout in the long-running saga over prisoner votes.

A serial killer, paedophiles and child murderers were among 1,015 inmates claiming compensation – estimated at £1,000 each – for being denied the vote in general elections.

At the same time, they and their human rights lawyers were seeking thousands in legal costs, and even submitted a claim to be reimbursed for the stamps and envelopes they used to submit their case, legal papers showed.

The European Court of Human Rights confirmed earlier rulings, dating back to 2005, that it is unlawful for Britain to have a blanket ban on prisoners voting. 

But, in a victory for the taxpayer, the judges rejected the claim for costs and a cash settlement.

David Cameron has claimed the idea of inmates taking part in elections makes him 'physically ill' and vowed to challenge any ruling giving a right to vote

It is thought that the decision will save the UK £1million in compensation alone – and it will be seen as a conciliatory gesture in Whitehall.

Leigh Day, a London firm of solicitors which represented more than 550 of the prisoners, is planning to lodge an appeal.

Effectively, the lawyers have been left to pick up the cost of bringing the claims, and could be heavily out of pocket.

The claimants include David Mulcahy, the ‘Railway Rapist’, who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for three murders and seven rapes in the 1980s, and Peter Chester, 60, serving life for raping and strangling his seven-year-old niece in 1977. The lead applicant was James Stevens McHugh, 88, a sex offender.

The court’s ruling has kicked a decision on how to sanction Britain over the voting ban into the long grass until after the election in May.

Following Conservative threats to leave the controversial court’s jurisdiction, a string of verdicts have gone Britain’s way – such as last week’s judgment that it is acceptable to hand whole-life sentences to the worst killers.

David Cameron, with the backing of a majority of MPs, has said that the prospect of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel physically ‘sick’. 

Yesterday Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, said: ‘This issue exactly demonstrates why the Conservatives have pledged in a majority government to make changes to the human rights framework in the UK. 

'I believe our Parliament should have the final say over matters like this.’

A senior Government source said: ‘The truth is Strasbourg knows the Conservatives are serious when they say they want a fundamental shift in power, so that decision-making happens in this country and not over there.

‘Which makes the idea of a Labour majority at the general election in a few months all the more frightening.

‘We’d be straight back to square one, with the court wanting to flex its muscles, and without any prospect of reform to the human rights framework.’

Conservative backbenchers said the verdict showed what could be achieved if Britain stood up to European institutions. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The European Court made clear it can’t force Britain to change its democratically elected law.

‘That exposes as nonsense the claim that protecting our democratic rights would cost the taxpayer a fortune or lead to us being kicked out of the Council of Europe. Ironically, Strasbourg has boosted the case for Conservative reform of our human rights laws.’

The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ruled the ban breached inmates' rights, but ruled out awarding compensation

Glyn Gaskarth, of think-tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘This verdict, made by an unelected court which has no democratic legitimacy, is wrong and dangerous.’

Sean Humber, of law firm Leigh Day, said it would be seeking a review of the decision not to award compensation.

‘We seem to be in the sad position where the Government is taking an almost perverse pleasure in ignoring successive court judgments,’ he said. 

‘It should be worrying to all of us that the Government appears to have so little regard for its international human rights obligations.’
