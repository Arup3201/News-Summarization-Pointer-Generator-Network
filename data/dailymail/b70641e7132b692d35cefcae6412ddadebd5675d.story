After losing a presidential election it is only natural to enter the prescribed period of soul searching, followed by the question: 'What if thing's had been different?'

But rather than accept their lot and strive to fight harder next time round, some Republicans want to change the electoral rules in a bid to make it easier for them to win in four years.

On Wednesday, Virginia's Republican-controlled Congress proposed a bill that would allocate electoral votes by congressional district, instead of the current winner-take-all system.

What could have been: If the system had been based on proportional representation and allocated electoral votes by congressional district, Mitt Romney would now be President

The current system: Barack Obama was elected President in November by 332 electoral votes to 206

Indeed, under such a system Mitt Romney would have won last November's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes.

In
Virginia, for example, President Obama would have claimed just four of 
the state's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election, rather than all of 
them.

Senator 
Charles W. Carrico Sr. sponsored the bill saying his rural constituents 
in Grayson feel 'that their voices are not heard' in general elections, 
adding: 'The last election, constituents were concerned that it didnâ€™t 
matter what they did, that more densely populated areas were going to 
outvote them.'

So close: Under such a system Mitt Romney would have won last November's election with a larger proportion of congressional district votes

He said only in Maine and Nebraska are votes awarded based on turnout in each congressional district.

But
critics have labelled it the 'sore losers' bill', arguing that it would
produced a 'skewed election' where a candidate could win the popular 
vote in a state but still lose a proportion of electoral college votes.

What if? In Virginia, under the Republican's proposed new system, President Obama would have claimed just four of the state's 13 electoral votes in the 2012 election, rather than all of them

Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is urging people to sign a petition against the bill.

In an open email, he wrote: 'We can't sit silently by as they try to manipulate the democratic process for political advantage.

Under the current electoral college system, the candidate who wins the popular vote does not 
necessarily win the election.

Each
of the US's 50 states has a number of electoral votes based on its size
- the largest, California, gets 55 votes while Wyoming has just three.

Every four years, Americans head to the polls to choose their preferred candidate for President and Vice-President.

In all but two states (Maine and Nebraska), the candidate who wins the majority of votes in a state wins ALL that state's electoral votes.

The first candidate to reach a majority 270 votes out of 538.

But Republicans in Virginia say the system is unfair. They want a 
system that works more like that of Nebraska and Maine, where electoral 
votes are allocated by proportional 
representation.

It means the candidate with the most votes in each of those states wins 
two electoral votes, for their two Senators, before the remaining electoral
votes are doled out by congressional district.

'We can't let them attack the very democratic institutions and rights that others have sacrificed so much to gain - just because they don't believe they can win in a fair election fight.'

Similar changes are reportedly also being considered in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

They, like Virginia, all helped vote Obama into the White House in the past two elections but are controlled by Republicans at the state level.

But the proposals have not been welcomed by all corners of the Grand Old Party.

Louisiana's Republican Chairman Roger Villere said: 'The Electoral College has served the country quite well.'

'This is coming from states where it might be an 
advantage, but I'm worried about what it means down the road. This is a 
system that has worked. That doesn't mean we can't talk about changes, 
but we have to be very careful about any actions we might take.'

The remaining electoral
votes are then assigned by congressional district, meaning candidates can each receive votes from both Nebraska and Maine.
