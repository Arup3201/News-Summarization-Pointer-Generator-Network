A young Sydney man has been suspended from his job and is 'scared to leave' his house after a hate-filled rant threatening those who do not follow Islam was posted from his Facebook account.

The 22-year-old allegedly threatened to 'cut the throats' of any Australian who opposes Islam, and said the nation is headed towards a third world war.

He also apparently wrote that 'aussie dogs' should convert before its too late otherwise they will be forced to suffer the 'wrath' of the religion.

A Sydney man who threatened to 'cut the throats' of Australians who oppose Islam in a hateful Facebook post said he did not write the comments and was hacked  

However the Sydney Trains employee told Nine News he did not post the comments to the anti-Islam Facebook page Australian Defence League, and he is now a target himself.

'It's thrown my whole world out of balance', the non-practicing Muslim told the program. 'It's scary, I'm scared to leave my house.'

The man, who was not identified out of fears for his safety, was suspended from his job as a customer service representative after his employer was alerted to the post, which warned all opponents of Islam 'will perish in the fiery pits of hell'.

Upon discovering the post the young man, from Sydney's west, said he was caught completely off guard before the fear of his account being hacked and the confusion over who wrote the comments set in.

'My reaction was shock, complete shock. The thought of it still makes my heart sink. I'm Australian as can be,' he told Nine News.

Following the tirade the 22-year-old said he has received a torrent of hate, with people threatening to cut his throat or put a bullet in his head.

He said he was in shock after he discovered the post, which was written on the Facebook page of anti-Islam group Australian Defence League

Sydney Trains have launched a full investigation into the incident and NSW Police have also been alerted.

'Sydney Trains expects our staff to behave in a courteous, respectful and lawful manner at all times. There are serious consequences if a staff member is found to have breached the guidelines that are currently in place, aside from any action taken by the police', a spokesperson told the program.

The president of the Australian Defence League said despite the man denying he posted the comments, he believes they definitely came from him and his page simply reposted them.
