American boxing fans will have to pay up to $100 (£67.48) if they want to watch Floyd Mayweather's showdown with Manny Pacquiao.

TV companies HBO and Showtime, both of whom will broadcast the fight in the States, confirmed the recommended prices for the May 2 battle as the most expensive in pay-per-view boxing history.

The fight itself will set viewers back $89.95 (£60.70), but any HD surcharge up to $10 could be added on by TV providers.

Mayweather's fight against Canelo Alvarez in September 2013 cost US viewers $64.95

The price represents almost a 40 per cent increase on the previous high of $64.95 (£43.83) for Mayweather's fight against Canelo Alvarez in September 2013.

The fight on May 2 is expected to break the pay-per-view record of $152million set by that fight in 2013, and is also expected to surpass the 2.5 million buys that Mayweather's fight against Oscar De La Hoya accumulated in 2007.

That means that US viewers will have to fork out over three times the amount that UK watchers will pay to watch the fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

Sky won the bidding war to screen the fight on British shores, and it will be shown on Sky Box Office at a cost of £19.95.
