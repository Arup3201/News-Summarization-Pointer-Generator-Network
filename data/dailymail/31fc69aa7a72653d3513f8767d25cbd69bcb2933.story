Some women say dating a shorter man isn't an option but Mindie Kniss, whose husband Sean Stephenson  is 2ft 8in tall, couldn't care less.

The couple, who are both motivational speakers, met through a mutual friend in 2009 and married in 2012 after Mindie moved to Chicago to be closer to Sean.

'It’s a joy to be married to this woman – not a day goes by when I don’t tell her I love her like 8,000 times,' says Sean.

 Mindie Kniss says she and her husband Sean Stephenson have an 'awesome' sex life

'People think she’s sweet for being in love with me but they’ve got it wrong, I’m the saint in this marriage – I take care of her.' 

Despite their happiness the couple have been targeted by internet trolls who suggested that Sean could never satisfy Mindie sexually and that she is with him only for his money.

36-year-old Mindie, who is 4ft 11in, said: 'I had to set the record straight. Just because he's disabled doesn’t mean we don’t have an awesome sex life.

'It wasn’t love at first sight but Sean is one of the most sexual people I have ever met – it’s appalling to suggest that my husband cannot satisfy me sexually and it’s none of their business.'

'I’m the most sexual person I know,' confirms her husband. 'Sex is probably the biggest part of my life.' 

At 35, Sean is 33.6 inches (2ft 8") tall with shorter than average legs because of brittle bone disorder

Sean was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or, as it is more commonly known, Brittle Bone Disorder.

Aged 35, he is just 33.6in tall and has shorter than average legs due to his condition, which affects bone growth. 

By the time Sean was 18 he had suffered over 200 fractures to his legs, arms, neck, collarbone, ankle, femur and nose.

His worst accident, which happened when he fell from his wheelchair while walking his dog, broke his skull, ankle, kneecap, thigh and hipbone.

'I can’t just mindlessly go to the store by myself,' says Sean. 'I have to be aware of my surroundings because a little bump or step down from a larger curb could be fatal to me.

'That’s something that’s just a part of my life and it’s also something that brings a lot of gifts too. Nobody forgets Sean Stephenson after they meet him.

Trolls have targeted the couple online and say Sean cannot possibly satisfy Mindie sexually

Mindie and Sean also hope people will start to accept that disabled people can and do want sex lives 

Six months after the couple first met during a discussion on Facebook, Mindie attended a motivational speaking event in Chicago.

Mindie, who then lived in Oregon, said: 'The speaker mentioned Sean Stephenson and said this guy was only 3ft tall but living large.

'He told us that Sean had been on stage with the Dalai Lama and Bill Clinton. I was intrigued enough to actually check him out.'

In December 2009, Mindie returned to Chicago and met  Sean for the first time in person. 'We got along very well, and he kissed me at the end of the day,' she remembers fondly.

'I was in such a rush to leave to see my family for the holiday and I was left thinking that Sean was such a playboy.'

She returned to Chicago in April 2010 and the pair spent a weekend together in a hotel during which they made love for the first time.

'It was different from having sex with an averaged size person of course - but it wasn’t a problem at all,' says Mindie.

Mindie says some of her normal-sized ex boyfriends had emotional issues that were harder to handle 

She has also hit out at people who say she is with Sean solely for money

Sean proposed in the spring of 2011, at an event in California, USA - with their family and friends looking on from their seats among an audience of more than 100 people.

They were married on September 14, 2012 in Chicago by a film-maker friend, and exchanged vows they had written themselves.

Despite their happiness, the couple, who now live in Scottsdale, Arizona, still fall victim to internet trolls but have resolved to not let strangers stand in the way of their happiness.

'Most people think I look past his disability, when his physical differences are clearly obvious', says Mindie. There is full acceptance here. We all have challenges - it’s just his are visible.

'There are people I’ve dated in the past who have internal issues that are way harder to deal with.'

 'I think people are uncomfortable with the idea that those with disabilities are normal human beings and that they have sexual desires and fantasies and enjoy being touched and touching,' says Sean.

'I think it’s a big statement more abut people not being comfortable with their own bodies and the thought of the disabled having sex lives. '

Sean has had his fair share of challenges and had broken bones more than 200 times by the age of 18

His worst accident saw him break his skull, ankle, kneecap, thigh and hipbone - leaving him in agony
