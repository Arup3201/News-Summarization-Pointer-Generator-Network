Shocking footage has emerged of three young people sticking out of a sunroof of a moving vehicle, waving their arms in the air while the driver is travelling on an 80km/h road.

The video, which was captured on a dashboard camera, shows the car driving along Wainuiomata Hill Road in Lower Hutt in the Wellington region of New Zealand on Friday afternoon.

It appears three people, believed to be females, were standing up inside the moving vehicle with half their bodies visible on the roof as the driver was travelling around a curved road.

Travelling along the winding road, their hair can be seen flying through the breeze.

But it seems one woman was allegedly hanging out of the side of the vehicle, as she appears to be perched out the rear window.

The video was posted onto Facebook by Henry Hogg shortly after the dangerous act and has received more than 11,000 views.

Hogg claims that he was driving at 80km/h at the time, which is the speed limit on the 'stretch of road' while the the reckless car was travelling ahead of him.

A caption along the video said: 'Followed these F'Wits [sic] over the hill this evening. Hope your parents realise you only want to be temporary citizens.'

Wellington District Command Centre Senior Sergeant James McKay confirmed with stuff.co.nz that the incident was reported to police and an investigation is underway.

He said both the driver and passengers of the vehicle demonstrated 'very irresponsible behaviour'.

It is unclear what happened after the incident but Hogg claims that he has given a statement and the copy of the video to police.
