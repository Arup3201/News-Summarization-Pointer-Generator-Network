The poster that has appeared around Cambridge offers students 'easy cash' for information

Animal rights extremists are offering undergraduates at Cambridge University money in exchange for personal details of students involved with experiments on animals.

A newly founded network known as the National Operation Anti-Vivisection (NOAV) has covered parts of Cambridge in posters encouraging students to ‘shop’ their peers for cash.

It asks for personal details of scientists at the university, including names, pictures, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses, with the tag line: ‘Do the right thing and earn some money, what could be better?’

The anti-animal testing organisation, which claims to be a grass-roots network of animal rights activists, says animal experimentation is ‘cruel, outdated and unscientific’.

NOAV says it wants people to ‘name and shame’ students that experiment on animals for science because ‘they should not be given the cover of anonymity’ and that ‘social pressure is the best way to get them to reconsider that career choice.’

Spokesman William Evans told student newspaper Varsity: ‘It is high time that universities move into the 21st century and start promoting human relevant research, such as computer modelling and micro-dosing.’

He added that the campaign is intended to be ‘non-threatening, peaceful and legal’, saying: ‘We will not be disclosing and personal addresses or phone numbers that we receive, as our approach is based on social as opposed to physical pressure.’

But concerns have been raised after the dozens of posters appeared to entice students by advertising it as a chance to ‘earn some beer money’ in return for information.

Tom Holder, who founded advocacy group Speaking of Research - which supports the use of animal experiments in scientific tests where merited - condemned the incentive scheme as ‘targeting students’.

National Operation Anti-Vivisection says animal experimentation is ‘cruel, outdated and unscientific’

The Oxford graduate, who calls NOAV animal rights 'extremists', has warned that the hostile environment  may force young science students out of a career in the sciences.

He posted on his blog: ‘Stalking and harassing students is not a legitimate way of running a campaign.

‘It is these sorts of actions which can force brilliant minds out of the life sciences out of fear.’

In a letter addressed to budding scientists and posted on its website, NOAV states: ‘You can choose to perpetuate the outdated, cruel and scientifically flawed notion that data from non-human animals can be accurately extrapolated to human beings.

‘The public are against animal experiments and you will become a social pariah, not wanting to reveal the disgusting/socially unacceptable job that you do to anyone but the closest of friends.

‘You will be subject to continual protest from animal rights activists throughout your life, and will not get a moment’s peace from the ongoing aggressive but lawful pressure exerted by the animal rights movement.’

Cambridge University has been targeted by the group, but other university towns are also set to be hit

Other university towns across the country have also reportedly been targeted in the campaign, but Cambridge has so far been the city receiving the most attention.

It is thought that a plan by British multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to build a headquarters in Cambridge is one reason for the focus.

A campaign against Huntingdon Life Sciences, in Cambridgeshire, by Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty came to an end in August this year after 15 years of protesting.

The organisation, which has been subject of a long campaign, has seen several of its activists given prison sentences and announced it would disband after tougher laws were introduced.
