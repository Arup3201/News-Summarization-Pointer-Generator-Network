A shocking photograph was posted onto Taco Bell's Facebook page yesterday showing an unnamed employee licking a long stack of taco shells.

The image was posted onto the company's official page by 'Jj O'Brien Nolan', along with the comment 'This sure says a lot about your employees'.

The employee hasn't been identified nor has his relationship to the poster.

Tongue lashing: This Taco Bell employee lost his job after this photograph was posted to the Taco Bell Facebook page and went viral

However, some commentators are 
speculating the outlet is in Ridgecrest, California.

Others claim it is just
 a joke and the shells were stale and headed for the bin rather than for 
public consumption.

'Regardless
 of the circumstances,  an employee should never represent themselves 
and their employer in such a manner, especially when you are working in 
the food service industry,' said one commenter.

'This just makes me hungry,' stated another.

Despite the risks of being caught, this isn't the first time fast food workers have gotten into hot water over questionable treatment of food photographed and posted to social media.

Taco trials: Taco Bell isn't new to controversy on social media, with the latest incident just one in a series of embarrassing instances of employees photographed playing with their food

In April, a KFC worker posted photographs of herself licking a pile of mashed potatoes on Facebook and was promptly fired by her employer.

Last year, three Burger King employees from Ohio were fired after images of them standing in two bins full of shredded lettuce were uploaded to their Facebook pages.

And in another shameful Taco Bell image, a worker tweeted a photograph of himself urinating into a plate of nachos in August last year.

Viral: Taco Bell's Facebook page has filled with comments regarding the incident varying from the outraged to the amused

‘I pissed on them where nobody could see, in private, an[d] I threw them away. There’s literally nothing they can do. Fire me. I don’t care,’ Cameron Jankowski of Fort Wayne said of the photo.

Taco Bell took him up on his offer and he was relieved of duties immediately.

The latest fast food atrocity is likely to result in the same fate for the taco-licking employee, if he is indeed still working there.

Taco Bell has not commented on the photograph.
