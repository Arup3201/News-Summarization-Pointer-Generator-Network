He's young, he's English, and he's a centre forward. But Harry Kane is still underrated.

'I have always believed in Harry since the first day… he has a very strong mind and is a very good player.'

These were Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino's words in August, and events since will have only strengthened his confidence in the 21-year-old.

Yet still, there isn't a frenzied hype surrounding the front man, who has four goals in his five cup games this term and six goals in nine caps for England Under 21s.

A good thing? Perhaps. Team-mate Andros Townsend's career has stalled since being heralded by Harry Redknapp as the closest thing to Arjen Robben English football has produced.

The fact Spurs have two big-money, big-name and big-wage strikers in Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor goes against Kane. But going for him is the Europa League, a platform on which Kane can prove he deserves to start in the Premier League over Soldado in particular. Spurs' Road To Warsaw could push Kane into the big time.

His form on paper since breaking into the first team far exceeds that of the Spaniard's, a £26million signing from Valencia last summer.

The Englishman scores or creates a goal every 111 minutes in a Spurs shirt; Soldado every 152 minutes and Adebayor every 142.

Roberto Soldado has been a major disappointment since joining from Valencia for £26m in the summer of 2013

Kane has also impressed playing behind the striker, but he has only ever started with Soldado twice - both in this season's Europa League. Pochettino may try it again on Thursday evening against Asteras Tripolis on ITV4, but in the Premier League it is often one or the other.

Spurs' indifferent form has forced calls for the youngster to lead the line in the top flight, and though comparisons to a young Teddy Sheringham may be premature, he is clever, astute and can score a variety of goals.

There are still question marks as to whether Kane can be the lone striker in Pochettino's favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, but the doubts over Soldado are far greater at present.

Many saw this as Kane's breakthrough year at White Hart Lane, but if he finds himself sitting behind Soldado in the pecking order come pre-season 2015, impatience could kick in.

Kane would prosper with a start week in, week out. If Spurs can't provide that, a move to a mid-table Premier League club would make sense.

The fear is that Spurs are constantly attempting to cling onto the tails of the top four, and playing a 21-year-old striker with just seven Premier League starts under his belt is risky.

The culture goes that if a player cost the club millions, he should be tried and tried over the promising academy graduate, no matter who is on better form.

Understandable, but Kane may begin to feel his qualities could be better utilised elsewhere.

Nevertheless, Kane signed a new contract in August, 'keeping him' at the club until 2019, and Spurs are obviously keen on giving Kane his chances in short spells for now. And of course, a bigger stage beckons if Spurs can lift the Europa League this season, with the competition forming a gateway for the Champions League for the first time.

He qualifies for the Republic of Ireland through his Irish-born Grandfather, but he ruled out a switch in August, instead pinning his hopes on a future England call up. He may not be waiting too much longer if he continues his form.
