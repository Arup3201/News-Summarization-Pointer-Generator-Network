Sir Paul McCartney has spoken of his shock when he heard John Lennon had been murdered and valled his killer Mark Chapman the 'the jerk of all jerks'.

The legendary singer described the moment he heard his former band mate had been been shot dead in New York in December 1980 on last night's episode of The Jonathan Ross Show.

In a heartfelt interview, he admitted his only solace was that the pair had managed to heal the rift that formed after The Beatles split in 1970 and were 'good friends'.

Speaking on The Jonathan Ross Show last night, Sir Paul McCartney called John Lennon's killer the 'jerk of all jerks' 

He said: 'I was at home and I got a phone call. It was early in the morning, I was in the country and I just got a phone call and it was like - I think it was like that for everyone.

'It was just so horrific, you couldn't take it in and I couldn't take it in and I just for days you just couldn't think that he was gone.

'It was just a huge shock, then I had to tell Linda (Sir Paul's late wife) and the kids and it was very difficult. It was very difficult for everyone.' 

He added: 'That was, like, a really big shock, I think, in most people's lives. A bit like Kennedy - there were certain moments like that.' 

Sir Paul held back tears as he said the worst thing for him about the murderer was he had no real motivation for his actions.

He said: 'For me it was just so sad that I wasn't going to see him (Lennon) again and we weren't going to hang.

'The phrase kept coming in my head 'the jerk of all jerks'.

Sir Paul, pictured with Lennon in June 1963, said his only solace was the pair had managed to heal the rift that formed after The Beatles split in 1980

'It was just like 'this is just a jerk, this is not even a guy politically motivated, it's just some total random thing.'

Speaking about the rifts in the band that led to its collapse, Sir Paul said it was all down to 'business'.

'We got to a point where we got really crappy over business,' he explained. 'To me that rubbed off on me and for years I thought 'oh me and John, bitter rivals' and all this stuff. '

However, he described himself as being 'very lucky' the two men had managed to get over their differences before Lennon's death.

He said that fighting each other eventually became 'boring' and they started to talk again.

Both their partners had recently given birth and they bonded over 'normal stuff' such as being new fathers and about recipes for making bread.

'I'm so glad because it would have been the worst thing in the world to have this great relationship that then soured and he gets killed, so there was some solace in the fact that we got back together. 

'We were good friends.

'The story about the break-up, it's true but it's not the main bit, the main bit was the affection.'

Earlier this year, Chapman, pictured left in 2012, boasted about the media attention he continues to receive from shooting Lennon, pictured right in August 1980, and added he is still approached for interviews
