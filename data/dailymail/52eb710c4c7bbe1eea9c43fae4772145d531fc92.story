England failed to recover from a sloppy first half at Twickenham, losing  28-31 to South Africa in their second autumn Test. Brad Barritt, Ben Morgan and Dave Wilson scored tries for England while Cobus Reinach, Jan Serfontein and Schalk Burger went over for the Springboks. Here, Sportsmail's Sam Peters gives his verdict on how both sets of players fared.

ENGLAND 

Brown - 7

Two sharp breaks and always full of intent with ball in hand. Defensively sound but would be good to see him at first receiver more. 

Watson - 6 

Just like Rokoduguni before him, the Bath flyer was starved of the ball as England’s inside backs failed to release him.

Brad Barritt goes over for England's third try, but it isn't enough to prevent defeat for Stuart Lancaster's men

Barritt - 6

Never anything other than committed and brave but those question marks over lack of creativity persist. Superb defence. 

Eastmond - 6

Guilty of an early knock-on following a sharp break but will again be frustrated by lack of opportunities. 

May - 6 

What is the point in picking the Gloucester ace if he is hardly ever going to see the ball? Starved of the ball for the second week running. 

Farrell - 5 (Ford 63) 

Looked rusty and short of fitness for the second week running. Kicking from hand again below par and isn't getting the line going. 

Care - 5 (Youngs 63) 

A 50th cap for the Harlequins No 9 will not be remembered as one of his finest. Lacked zip and pass was laboured.

Marler - 7 (Mullen 66)

Another strong scrummaging display from England with the Harlequin prop to the fore. A consistent performer. 

Hartley - 5

Line out throwing exemplary again and work in tight superb but blotted his copybook with a brainless stamp that led to a yellow. 

Wilson - 7 (Brookes 72)

England cannot blame their set piece forwards for their problems. Rock solid scrummaging and carried well. 

Attwood - 7 (Kruis 66) 

Early knock-on put England on back foot and really should have put Watson away for early try. Otherwise industrious and effective.

England's Billy Vunipola is brought down by South Africa duo Duane Vermeulen and Schalk Burger

Lawes - 6

Huge questions over whether he should have played following head knock last week. Line out good and work-rate high but looked heavy legged. 

Wood - 6 

Carried well in the second half but gave away too many penalties and will be frustrated by breakdown work. 

Robshaw (c) - 6 

Honest, hard-working and with an iron will but does not seem to be inspiring his team on the field. England second best at breakdown again. 

Vunipola - 4 (rep Morgan 44) 

Easily his worst display in an England shirt. Carried valiantly but knocked on far too often.

SOUTH AFRICA 

Le Roux - 8 

Brilliant catch and break to set up South Africa’s first try. Looked sharp all match and rock solid in defence. 

Pietersen - 6 

Just like his opposite men he was starved of possession  as his side chose a more direct approach. 

Serfontein - 7 

Defensively outstanding and powerful carrying in the best traditions of Springbok centres. Good pairing with De Villiers. 

De Villiers (c) - 7

Not as many carrying opportunities as the South African skipper would have liked but defensively he is a rock. 

Habana - 6 

A shame one of the world’s greatest ever wingers was not given the ball to show what he can do.

England's Courtney Lawes charges down a kick from South Africa's Pat Lambie

Lambie - 8 

An excellent all-round display with clever kicking from hand and tidy distribution. Goal kicking also first class. 

Reinach - 7 Very low error count and formed a sound partnership with Lambie. Justified his selection. 

Mtwawarira - 6 (Nyakane 75)

South Africa’s scrum was one of the few areas that creaked as the Beast was well tamed. 

Strauss - 7 (Du Plessis 61) 

Nasty, aggressive and combative within the laws, just. A nuggety performer who made a sound contribution. 

Du Plessis - 6 (Oosthuizen 64)

Not a brilliant scrummaging performance but a fairly solid day at the coalface. 

South Africa's star man was Patrick Lambie who scored three penalties, two conversions and a drop goal

Etzbeth - 8 (Botha 64)

Didn’t have the sort of influence he would have wanted but remains a muscular enforcer of the highest quality. 

Matfield - 7 

Cynical professional foul almost cost his team dearly but ultimately returned to close out the game. 

Coetzee - 7 

Superb defensive display and carried the ball well too. England’s back row dominated again. 

Burger - 8 

A man of the match display for an opposition No 7 for the second week running does not bode well for Robshaw. 

Vermeulen - 8 

A powerful ball carrier who was at the thick of most things for the Springboks. Impressive and aggressive.
