In the first of Sportsmail's reviews of the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014, JACK GAUGHAN looks at Matt Dickinson's biography of England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore. Look out for the others in the running thoughout next week.

Football is a sport to offer parallels like no other; none more heartbreakingly so than on the afternoon of April 29, 1972, as Bobby Moore's international career began drastically free-falling against the very enemy he had conquered at Wembley six years previously.

There he stood - England captain, England's rock for so long - completely shattered during a European Championship quarter-final against the brilliance of West Germany and Gerd Muller. Moore looked bereft, out of ideas. He was a man on the slide.

Months later - not helped by an ageing national side which was a shadow of its past glories - the first true ball-playing central defender found himself humiliated against Poland and Sir Alf Ramsey's side failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup.

The game froze. So immaculate was Moore's previous 11 seasons moulding himself as a pristine great, marked by the admirable refusal to hoick balls clear and stand for what he believed in, that this was scarcely believable. His nadir, for both club and country, came on deciding to turn back into Poland striker Wlodzimierz Lubanski in a bid to move clear in midfield, gifting possession and ultimately the second goal during a chastening defeat.

In the fascinatingly meticulous Bobby Moore - The Man in Full, Matt Dickinson succinctly pens of that moment: 'The ball is stolen, the king deposed.'

And that, rather tragically, was that. Moore, who was never awarded a knighthood despite the joy he gave English football, played one more international and found maintaining his usual impeccable standards extremely difficult after the 1970 World Cup in Mexico where - but for costly injuries and questionable Ramsey management - they felt a justifiable case for retaining the biggest prize in sport.

Prefacing that tournament had been the theft scandal undermining their preparations. Moore was accused of stealing a bracelet close to the team's hotel in the warm-up and spent four days under house arrest in Bogota. Having spoken to countless subjects close to the case, Dickinson moves to quash any lingering suggestions that Moore had anything to do with it as much as possible - backed up by eye-witness evidence. 

What mustn’t be taken away from his story is that Moore became the first English superstar on the global sporting map - modest and a gentleman with it.

That should never be forgotten. But, reading the biography, you cannot remove yourself from the fact that he was an individual whose life was troubled. The divorce to childhood sweetheart Tina is covered, as are Moore's failed business ventures, links with the East End underworld and his secret battle with testicular cancer at just 23.

There are accounts of Moore’s association with the infamous Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel - scene of George Cornell’s murder by Ronnie Kray - as well as the crippling losses he had to front almost alone after sinking thousands into the lavish Woolston Hall, a financial black hole to nearly finish him. 

It might have been very different had he been granted the moves to Tottenham Hotspur and then Brian Clough’s Derby County he so desperately craved.

The most revealing aspect of a personal life so rarely dissected is his relationship with drink. After that ghastly mistake against the Poles, Dickinson wrote: 'There was only one way to find relief and that was in a beer can.'

Tales of boozing - most strikingly the night before an FA Cup tie in Blackpool, after which West Ham boss Ron Greenwood wanted to sack his skipper - are a common theme and cannot be ignored.

'Sometimes he'd come in with his bow tie and dinner jacket on where he'd come back from a function, been out all night somewhere,' Harry Redknapp, team-mate at Upton Park says. 

On a Sunday morning Moore would turn up at the ground, throw on a boiler suit and trudge around the perimeter of the pitch, allowing the drink to seep out.

The book delves deep into the icon's complex personality and sparks debate whether football failed him

This is a book which delves deep into the icon’s complex personality - very few of the tens of interviewees claim to have truly known him - and sparks debate whether football failed one of its very few real legends. The reader is left to make up their own mind, but the answer seems obvious; Moore ended up struggling as manager of Oxford City in the Isthmian Premier League in front of tiny crowds and then Southend United.

Happy memories should not be forgotten. Moore’s second wife Stephanie recounts the joyous times they shared together. After the obvious turmoil post-retirement, she is said to have come as a relief. Moore was reborn.

He was taken too soon by misdiagnosed bowel cancer in 1993, typically retaining his quiet dignity to the last.

Bobby Moore will rightly be forever remembered as the champion of his era, the most serenely masterful footballer ever to have hailed from these shores; ‘The Man in Full’, not shying away from human fallacies, serves as a reminder that he was the same as every one of us.
