Mo Farah and James Dasaolu both won European gold to continue Great Britain’s best ever start to a major athletics championships, a seven-medal haul with more likely in the coming days.

‘We’re all feeding off each other,’ said Dasaolu. ‘Everyone’s feeling positive.’

Farah won the 10,000 metres title just ahead of team-mate Andy Vernon to rescue a lacklustre season and emulate the success of Jo Pavey in the women’s race on Tuesday. Dasaolu then won the 100m with a relieved Harry Aikines-Aryeetey taking bronze.

Medals table: Great Britain top the charts at the end of competition on day two in Zurich

To cap an historic day in Zurich, Tiffany Porter won the 100m hurdles gold and Ashleigh Nelson 100m bronze.

Dasaolu cruised to victory in 10.06sec, a long way behind his personal best of 9.91 but enough to seal victory over France’s Christophe Lemaitre, who took silver. The Briton still acknowledged he will need to improve to challenge the Caribbean and American sprinters who dominate the world stage.

‘Winning a medal is going to give me confidence but I’m under no illusion that the guys out there are running 9.8 and 9.9 on a regular basis,’ he said. ‘There is still work to be done. But if we rewind to February when I pulled my hamstring and my tendon, that was a down-point. I wasn’t sure that I was going to be able to compete in the summer so this is a lovely feeling.’

Dasaolu’s title represents Great Britain’s first individual sprint medal since Darren Campbell won gold at the European Championships in Budapest in 1998.

The 26-year-old had proved his durability by qualifying fastest in the semi-finals. France’s Jimmy Vicaut, the fastest man in Europe this season, did not make it to the start line, withdrawing with a knee injury.

There had been hopeful suggestions that Dasaolu might threaten Linford Christie’s British 100m record of 9.87, which has stood for 21-years.

The track at Zurich’s Letzigrund stadium is famously quick, but the weather was not conducive to fast running. A vicious wind caused the meeting to be delayed by 30 minutes and a light rain began to fall just before the start. There was a further wait after Aikines-Aryeetey was shown a yellow card for a false start.

‘My spike dropped out of my shoe, which caused it,’ said the south Londoner. ‘When I saw I wasn’t (disqualified) I just said “thank you Lord”.’ Seconds later he was being confirmed as the bronze medallist in a photo-finish with Dwain Chambers. Aikines-Aryeetey sank to his knees with a beaming smile. 

The start had also not been one of Dasaolu’s best. ‘I just had to zone out and focus,’ the new champion said. ‘I actually thought I had messed up my opportunity of even picking up a medal but once I got through my drive phase I was able to pull away and win.’

As for double Olympic champion Farah, he is a long way from his best but gritted his teeth as he crossed the line to become European 10,000m champion six weeks after dramatically collapsing at a training camp.

Farah was forced to work hard in the final lap, grimacing as he powered down the home straight ahead of Great Britain team-mate Vernon and two Turkish athletes. The Farah showboating was saved until after victory was confirmed in 28min 8.11sec. Then the Mobots flowed and he was embraced by friend Usain Bolt, who was in Zurich doing promotional work.

It was no surprise Farah was below par — this is only his second race on the track in a year where he collapsed twice, came a disappointing eighth in the London Marathon and withdrew from the Commonwealth Games because he was unfit.

Vernon was perhaps best known previously for his Twitter spat with Scottish athlete Lynsey Sharp last week. He sniped at the 800m runner for boasting about buying a designer handbag after winning silver at the Commonwealth Games.

Farah had sauntered off the start-line and remained at the back of the pack for two laps. One effortless kick and he had moved up to be second of 24 athletes after four circuits. He was, as Steve Cram remarked, ‘putting his comfortable coat on’.

After the year he’s had, Farah needed a cushioned reintroduction to major competition on the track.

He spoke earlier this week of his latest collapse 40 days ago when he lost consciousness in his bathroom after a training run in Park City, Utah.

‘It’s been a hard time for me,’ he said. ‘I’ve still got four stitches in my ear from falling in the bathroom so to come out here and win meant more than anything else in the world.’

‘This one meant a lot to me,’ he said. ‘Two weeks ago there was doubt I was going to compete here after I pulled out of the Commonwealth Games. I wanted this title more badly because of that.’

He was followed home by Vernon, who chased down Turkey’s Ali Kaya and dipped on the line to clinch the silver in 28:08.66.
