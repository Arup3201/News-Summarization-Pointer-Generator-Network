No contest: Dr Soraya Ann Abbassian has avoided jail time as part of a plea agreement after a woman she was preparing for late night surgery died

A doctor who attempted to perform a late-night tummy tuck on an employee who later died has dodged jail time.

Dr. Soraya Abbassian, 45, yesterday plead no-contest to criminally negligent homicide over the death of 59-year-old Judith Ann DesMarets in 2010.

DesMarets died four days after Abbassian gave her anesthetic in preparation for free cosmetic surgery, without staff or proper equipment, at Woodland Park Medical Plaza in Oregon.

Abbassian didn't have the essential 
emergency equipment needed to revive the mother of two after she 
suffered a seizure on the operating table.

OregonLive.com reported Abbassian performed approximately 15 chest compressions and then called 911.

DesMarets
 was unconscious on the exam room floor when paramedics arrived and was 
put on life support in hospital. She died on December 19.

An autopsy revealed DesMarets died in hospital from the toxic effects of the anesthetic.

In August 2012, a Multnomah County 
grand jury indicted Abbassian on one count each of second-degree 
manslaughter and recklessly endangering another.

The reckless 
endangerment charge is related to a separate procedure.

However, after pleading no-contest, the charges were dismissed.

KOIN.com reported Abbassian is expected to be sentenced to three 
years formal probation and 300 hours of community service on October 14.

A no-contest plea means Abbassian does not admit the prosecutors' allegations, but agrees that there is evidence that could lead a jury or judge to find 
her guilty.

The former Lake Oswega resident has been stripped of her medical license and fined $10,000 by the Oregon Medical Board for 'her disregard of professional ethics, patient safety and 
lack of clinical judgment'.

The OMB also stated in its report that Abbassian 'failed to conduct an appropriate and sufficient medical evaluation' on DesMarets before undertaking the after-hours procedure.

DesMarets, a mother of two, was a hospice nurse at Abbassian's clinic, and reportedly often looked after the doctor's children.

Her family said Abbassian was preparing for a tummy tuck, however the exact procedure has not been confirmed because no incisions were made.

In 2010, 
Abbassian told the OMB that 'she regularly performs dermatological 
procedures by herself, without office staff present, in her solo 
practice clinic.'

The Pennsylvania resident also admitted she had called emergency services to her
 clinic six other times for complications.

The other recklessly endangering charge which was also dismissed yesterday stemmed from a 
procedure on a different patient between July and
 September 2010.

The unidentified patient told investigators she experienced 
dizziness and a rapid heartbeat following the procedure.

Tim
 Quenelle, an attorney representing DesMaretsâ€™ son, said a civil 
settlement was reached in September 2011.

Kathleen Haley, executive director of the state Medical Board, which suspended Abbassian's license in December of 2010, said it's the first time in her 19 years with the agency that a doctor has been criminally charged in a case involving the death of an Oregon patient.

'I think the public can be reassured that it's a very rare occurrence,' Haley said. 'It's extremely unfortunate.'
