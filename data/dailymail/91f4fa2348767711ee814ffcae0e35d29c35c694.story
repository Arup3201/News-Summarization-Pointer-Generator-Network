As Liverpool crashed out of the Capital One Cup on Tuesday evening, a familiar scapegoat emerged. 

Mario Balotelli took much of the immediate blame for failing to properly mark Branislav Ivanovic, allowing the Serbian defender a free header from seven yards out. 

As Willian prepared to whip in a free kick in the first period of extra-time, Balotelli was seen grabbing Ivanovic's shirt as Liverpool got in to their defensive shape. 

Branislav Ivanovic rises to head Chelsea 1-0 in front against Liverpool on Tuesday night 

Ivanovic was initially being marked by Mario Balotelli but lost him to get a free header in the box

A few seconds later, however, Ivanovic had drifted behind his marker and fired in what turned out to be the winning goal in Chelsea's 1-0 victory.  

But was Balotelli solely to blame? 

Sportsmail columnist and former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher disagrees, instead highlighting faults in Liverpool's zonal marking system.

'It's not Mario's fault the goal! In zonal defence you attack the space in front of you! Costa goes in front of him so he goes with him,' Carragher wrote on kicca. 

'The fault initially is Gerrard, Lucas & Mario should all come back 3 yards so Stevie is in Lucas position etc. 

'As Willian takes it there are 3 Chelsea players between Mario & Johnson/Skrtel that's the problem those 2 are wrong side so there's too much space for them to run into.'

Indeed, replays of the goal seem to back up Carragher's assertions as Steven Gerrard and Lucas's starting position mean Willian's ball drifts completely past them into an area where Chelsea's players have plenty of room to run in to.

In effect, Gerrard and Lucas were defending 'zones' they did not need too as Chelsea had no players in or attacking that space. Therefore, as Carragher says, Liverpool's line should have moved three yards back. 

Balotelli, meanwhile, can be seen stepping forward and challenging Diego Costa as the Chelsea striker moves into his 'zone' after losing his marker Jordan Henderson.  

Had Henderson stayed with Costa then Balotelli may not have had to step forward and may have been better positioned to challenge Ivanovic. 

Balotelli must take responsibility for his lack of movement during his brief cameo at Stamford Bridge, but to blame him for the goal - is that really fair?
