Eight people including four firefighters and a police officer have been injured in a truck explosion which tore apart a section of highway in outback Queensland. 

Emergency crews were called to a truck rollover on the Mitchell Highway, about 30km south of Charleville in Queensland's southwest, about 9.30pm on Friday.

But the truck, carrying about 50 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, exploded after crews arrived injuring eight people and ripping apart a section of road.

The male truck driver sustained serious, but not life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to Brisbane.

Geoscience Australia registered a 2.0 magnitude earthquake at 10.12pm initially thought to be due to the ferocity of the explosion. 

Charleville Police Station senior sergeant Adrian Rieck told Queensland Country Life it was a catastrophic explosion.

'It literally destroyed the road,' he said.

'We literally had 53 tonnes of ammonium nitrate go off – it was like having a 53 tonne bomb explode and those people who went into assist without fear for their lives should be commended.' 

Two men who witnessed the crash, four fighters and the truck driver and a police officer were injured

A Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) spokesman said two of the four injured firefighters were still recovering in hospital after the incident.

The police officer, the two other firefighters and two men who witnessed the crash all received minor injuries and were taken to Charleville Hospital for treatment.

'The fire appliances in attendance sustained extensive damage due to the explosion,' the QFES spokesman said.

'QFES will continue to monitor the situation as the incident is expected to be protracted for a couple of days.'
