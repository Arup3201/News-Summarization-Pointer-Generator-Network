England's Oliver Fisher fired a first-round 65 to lead the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters by a shot.

Fisher carded eight birdies, including three in a row from the 16th, and one bogey in his seven-under-par round in Doha.

Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello was hot on his heels after a bogey-free 66, just ahead of a group of 11 players on five under.

They included England's Mark Foster, Scotland's Paul Lawrie and South African Ernie Els, all of whom also shot flawless rounds.

'I played nice today - it was a little bit breezy and I felt like I controlled my golf ball,' Fisher said on the European Tour website.

'I played good and gave myself a lot of chances so it was a good round.'

Justin Rose was in a tie for 14th on four under following a round which featured five birdies and a bogey.

'I couldn't really buy a putt coming in, but all in all happy with the round,' Rose said.

'It's nice to be somewhere in contention and it's a score on which to build for the rest of the week, it's the perfect type of start really.'
