A rancher is pictured standing over the remains of a man from El Salvador - his body left to decay beneath the blistering Texas sun.

Lavoyger Durham manages 13,000 acre El Tule ranch in Brooks County, about 100 miles from the southernmost tip of Texas. It has become a pathway for undocumented immigrants who are desperate to make a life for themselves in the U.S. 

The unidentified man, now nothing more than a skeleton and scraps of clothes, was abandoned by the smugglers who helped him to cross the border into the country illegally.

Though it is not on the border with Mexico, Brooks County does have a federal checkpoint on a major highway - where officials regularly stop vehicles in search of migrants trying to enter the country illegally. 

Smugglers bypass the checkpoint by making immigrants walk around it, through private ranches - such as the one Mr Durham manages - where temperatures regularly top 38 degrees Celsius.

It has become a popular route for migrants from Central America - all coming into the country in pursuit of the great American Dream. 

The migrants are often told that the journey is quick and easy - and set off with little more than the clothes on their back and bottles of water.  But on those long walks, through the arid Texas terrain, many would-be immigrants die of heat exhaustion, dehydration, and exposure. 

Their bodies are left to rot by the smugglers, who are for the most part paid before they take migrants across the border. Last year, Border Patrol documented 445 deaths of migrants coming to the United States — the third-highest number since 1998.
