Virgin Australia will beef up the comfort of air travel  next year as the airline moves to introduce additional leg room for each class of traveller.

In an announcement which aims to put it on top of Australia's list of air carriers, the company launched its new look cabins for 2015 across its Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft's on Wednesday.

Three classes - economy plus, business lite and the futuristic looking business first - will be part of the re-design with each category equipped with loads of additional leg room.

The futuristic looking business first bed offering 80 inches of leg room will be rolled out from next year

'Business  lite' passengers will enjoy a three-inch upgrade from 38 to 41  while those opting for the more expensive-style bedding have been luxuriously catered for with  80 by 28 inch dimensions making it 'the business class to beat.'

The extra-wide and extra-long flat beds will debut on Virgin's Airbus 330 in March 2015, with all six of the twin-aisle transcontinental jets upgraded by July.

Virgin will position the new seats as a 'business first' product, although it hasn't yet settled on a marketing moniker for the seats.

The 1-2-1 layout on both the A330s and Boeing 777s will provide direct aisle access for every passenger. 

Business class passengers will see a newly-designed business class bar with face-to-face service for up to four seated guests

Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti said Virgin is moving in to uncharted territory as it looks to trump rival Qantas.

'We've taken the fight to Qantas, this will widen the gap in our favour,' he said.

'I would classify this as more 'business first' than business class.'

Details on the company's economy plus seating are yet to be revealed but all three classes will see seats removed in order to make way for the additional room.

As well as being 80 inches wide the bed will also offer 28 inches of space in width

Mr Borghetti said premium economy has been designed for budget business passengers  looking for a more comfortable journey.

'This is going to be a more exclusive cabin' he said.

'The intention isn't economy plus but 'business lite', so while we pitch our new business class at halfway between business and first, premium economy will be halfway between economy and business but certainly closer to business class.'

This will also include an upgrade of the meals with consulting chef Luke Mangan 'already working on a new menu for us.'

The announcement looks to move Virgin Australia atop the list of Australia's air travel companies trumping Qantas

The 1-2-1 layout on both the A330s and Boeing 777s will provide direct aisle access for every passenger.

However, the premium economy bar will be axed as part of the make-over and a new bar introduced for business class guests that will offer face-to-face service.  

The redesign at the pointy end of the plane is based on the Super Diamond bed design from B/E Aerospace and customised by London-based design agency Tangerine. 

Decked out in contemporary charcoal with brushed aluminium trimming, the bed is 80 inches long and 28 inches wide.

Installing the new seats will see Virgin's business class cabin on the A330 shrink from 24 seats to 20, but Borghetti promised the fares 'will remain competitive' against Qantas. 

'Everywhere we've operated we've always brought fares down, so they have to be competitive, but that said, people will be prepared to pay for this product,'  he said.
