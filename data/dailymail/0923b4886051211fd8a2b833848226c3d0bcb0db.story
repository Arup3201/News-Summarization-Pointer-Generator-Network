Workers appear to be dwarfed by the vast tunnels being drilled beneath the streets of London for the ambitious £14.8billion Crossrail scheme which is now 60 per cent complete.

After four years of subterranean drilling, the project to transform London's rail network has seen more than 23 miles - nearly 90 per cent - of the tunnels finished.

The work is due to be completed in spring 2015 and by 2018 high-speed trains will be running from as far west as Reading in Berkshire, through central London to Abbey Wood in south London and as far east as Shenfield in Essex.

These pictures show the vast underground caverns at Crossrail's Bond Street, Farringdon, Paddington and Liverpool Street stations.

Crossrail chief executive Andrew Wolstenholme said: 'Crossrail is being delivered on time and on budget. These fantastic images show the scale of work taking place around the clock beneath the streets of London.

'We are on schedule to provide London and the South East with a fantastic new railway in 2018.'

Crossrail aims to shorten journey times and economic forecasts suggest the project will add up to £42billion to the UK economy

Around 200 million passengers will travel on Crossrail each year and station platforms will be 250m in length to accommodate the 200m trains
