Budget airlines are not carrying out new anti-terror security checks on electronic devices as confusion grows over exactly where the measures are being enforced.

The Department for Transport this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they can be taken on some flights travelling to Britain.

But they are not being enforced by airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair, as ministers' refusals to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures leads to increasing uncertainty among passengers.

Security checks: The Department for Transport this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they are allowed to board flights to Britain

The new security measures - which require passengers to switch on electrical devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones to prove they work - initially only applied to U.S flights.

On Tuesday the Department for Transport announced it had extended the rules to cover the UK, and warned all passengers to ensure their electronic devices are fully charged before attempting to board flights arriving in and departing from Britain.

The Department for Transport would not disclose the exact routes for security reasons, but Australian officials later claimed the routes affected include aircraft travelling between Britain and Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

There appeared to be some confusion over the new measures this morning, however, withÂ a Ryanair official saying the budget airline 'does not expect the rules will have any effect on short haul 
  flights within Europe'.

It is understood the rules are not being enforced by airlines such as easyJet (pictured) and Ryanair, as ministers' refuse to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures

The electronic device checks introduced by the Department for Transport this week will not affect all UK passengers.

Although they have refused to make public the routes affected, ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks.

It is understood this includes flights to and from the Middle East, Africa and parts of southern Europe.

If your flight is hit by additional security checks, it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate.

Arriving at the airport, passengers will check-in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way.

This will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags.

Passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they called to the departure gate earlier than usual if their flight is affected.

This is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly.

The Department for Transport says all passengers arriving or leaving the UK must prepare for the special measures, however.

The teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves, not by the airport, but the Department for Transport has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff.

If, for whatever reason, your device fails the security check, you will be forced to leave your device behind, and may even be banned from taking the flight itself.

An easyJet
 spokesman told MailOnline that the company was 'aware' that the 
security measures may be stepped up, but said the new rules did not yet 
apply to its passengers.

And despite the claims from the Australian officials, a number of passengers arriving from 
various locations within the Middle East and East Africa said security 
checks also remain as normal.

However
 both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic insist they are carrying out 
the additional security checks on all routes the Department of Transport
 told them are affected

The 'secondary' checks
 are understood to take place at the boarding gate by staff contracted by
 the airlines themselves, not employees of the central security team 
that carries out body and luggage scans earlier in the boarding process.

A
 Department for Transport spokesman said he would not be drawn on the 
specifics of the checks, or when in the process they take place, but 
insisted they are carried out by qualified security staff.

The new security measures are controversial as they could see innocent passengers forced to leave behind items worth thousands of pounds simply because the battery was not properly charged.

If a laptop, tablet, iPod or mobile phone cannot be switched on and proved to be working correctly, the Department of Transport's guideline is that this item must not be allowed to travel.

As these devices are commonly used to keep children amused during long waits in an airports departure lounge, the new rules could hit thousands of families.

Dixons said it had seen a 30 per cent increase in sales of battery chargers in its 
  airport branches last week, when the measures were first imposed on 
  flights to the U.S.

Now that the rules also apply to flights to the UK, this figure is expected to soar further.

There is also concern that the time taken to check every device could cause chaos and put additional pressure on already overstretched airport security systems.
