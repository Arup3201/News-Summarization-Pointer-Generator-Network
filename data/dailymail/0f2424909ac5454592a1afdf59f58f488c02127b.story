Accused: San Francisco sheriff's deputy Michael Lewlling was charged with beating a hospital patient in an emergency room

A San Francisco sheriff's deputy allegedly choked and beat a hospital patient who walked with a cane - then lied on the police report to cover his tracks.

Michael Lewelling, 33, was accused of approaching a sleeping man as he started to wake up, knocking away his walking cane, grabbing his neck, then arresting him.

He then filed a police report claiming that the man started the fight by attacking him with the cane, according to authorities, who say surveillance video proves he was lying. 

Lewelling, who has reportedly been with the San Francisco Sheriff's Department for five years, was arrested Friday and charged with perjury, filing a false police report and battery.

Prosecutors said footage from the November 3 attack shows the victim can be seen hunched over in a chair sleeping in the Emergency Room's waiting area, where he was scheduled to see a doctor later that day.

The video shows Lewelling approaching the victim as he is starting to wake up.  When the man attempts to walk away, the deputy grabs the back of his collar, pulls him back into the seat and knocks his cane away.

'A few seconds later, he appears to grab the victim's throat and begins to choke him.  The battery continued, and the victim was then placed under arrest,' prosecutors said.

'The victim never raised his cane in a threatening manner,' they added.

The case against the victim was presented by the Sheriff's Department to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office on November 4.

Victim: Lewelling was filmed by surveillance cameras attacking the patient at San Francisco General Hospital, according to authorities

That same day the San Francisco District Attorney's Office declined to charge the case and submitted a request for video evidence of the incident, prosecutors said.

After the charges were filed, Lewelling turned himself in and was given a bail of $138,000, according to ABC7 News. 

'The fact that a Sheriff's Deputy allegedly battered a patient at San Francisco General Hospital is unnerving,' said District Attorney George Gascón.

'What's worse is that he's also alleged to have perjured himself on a police report, unforgivable conduct that led to the arrest of the innocent victim.'
