She is not one to keep her opinions to herself and even after recently winning plaudits for her newly toned physique, Kelly Osbourne is proud to admit she is still a Spanx wearer at heart.

Although many women revel in their newly toned bodies and head straight to the lingerie store to flaunt what they have worked hard to achieve, Miss Osbourne is not a fan of barely-there panties.

Talking to WWD about her favourite lingerie, the star said: 'Spanx! I don’t do sexy underwear. Anyone who says anything else is so full of s**t. 'Who wants a lacy string up their ass all night?'

Spanx, a range of tummy trimming and thigh slimming undergarments, are also favoured by celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow, Sienna Miller and Tina Fey.

Kelly is now a trim size six after losing more than three stone in weight.

She was once a size 14 and weighed 11.5 stone at her heaviest.
