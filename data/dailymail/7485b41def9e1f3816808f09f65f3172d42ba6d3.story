A mother-of-two whose husband tried to burn her alive in front of their children before torching himself has spoken for the first time about her horrific ordeal.

Lisa Franklin, 42, from Dudley, in the West Midlands, was lucky to escape with her life after her husband Brian, who had abused her for years, doused her in petrol and tried to set her on fire after locking their two sons in the family car just feet away.

When she escaped, he shut himself in their home and set it ablaze - as his wife and two boys, aged 15 and 10, watched on in horror.

The couple met in 2000, married in 2003 and soon after Mrs Franklin fell pregnant with their son Brandon

Now brave Mrs Franklin is speaking out about her experiences as she wants to warn others about the horrors of domestic abuse.

She said: 'Brian tried to tear apart our family when he burned down our home but we are stronger than ever and looking forward to a bright future.

'He had been abusing me for years, but one day he really just flipped.

'I honestly thought I was going to die and I was terrified for myself and for my boys.

'It's unbelievable that it was just a few months ago, but we are finally beginning to move on with our lives.'

The couple met in 2000, married in 2003 and soon after Mrs Franklin fell pregnant with their son Brandon.

Mrs Franklin said: 'We lived a completely ordinary life. I had a new baby and Brian worked as a mechanic.

'He had a good side to him. He would help anyone he could.'

But slowly Brian started to change. In 2009 he became stricter with the children and had violent mood swings.

'He smashed glasses or threw things around, and then one day, he started laying into me,' Mrs Franklin said.

'And he wasn't just physically violent. He became possessive and controlling.

'Dinner had to be on the table at a certain time and I needed his permission for everything.

'But I got so used to it I thought it was a normal life.

'I thought about leaving him before and we split briefly a couple of times.

'I took the kids to my parents' but he always turned up a few days later with flowers and apologies and so I took him back.'

Brian's anger came to a head in February last year. 

Mrs Franklin came home and he started shouting that she was putting her job as a care co-ordinator before the family.

Mrs Franklin said: 'I thought it was just another one of his rants and I turned away but before I knew it he was dragging me across the kitchen by my hair.

'I was screaming at my youngest son to call the police and then the next thing I knew he was cutting off chunks of my hair with a knife, slashing my wrists and pushing me out the front door.

The police arrested Brian and told him not to contact the family but less than a week later, he sneaked into the house.

'He crept up behind me and said he was ending it and he taking me with him, and then screamed at the boys to leave and get in the car,' said Mrs Franklin.

'That was when he started throwing the petrol all over me, in my hair and clothes and mouth, and I knew this was my last chance to escape.

'I managed to push him away, yanked at the door and ran straight into a neighbour's house screaming to call the police.'

In his bid to chase Mrs Franklin down, Brian tripped and she got away.

As he clambered up, their sons, trapped in the car, saw him shut the door behind him and then an explosion of light filled the front room.

An inquest determined that Brian, after entering their house with an air rifle and a petrol can, had tried to kill himself when he set the fire.

In the aftermath, Mrs Franklin and her sons moved in with her brother and tried to piece their lives back together.

Mrs Franklin said: 'I couldn't believe what had happened had happened to me - my family, my husband, my house.

'It only sank in when I when my brother took me to get some essentials at our local shopping centre and I saw someone I knew.

'I hid my face because I was so ashamed to have to explain what had happened.

Mrs Franklln and her sons have moved - she says they are finally 'free' from her violent husband

'Slowly we began to rebuild our lives. The boys went back to school and six weeks after the fire, we were allowed back into the house.

'I took one step over the threshold but couldn't make it any further and my best friend and the fire investigation team tried to salvage anything that was left.

'The downstairs was completely destroyed. Where our big sofa was, there was just one spring left on the floor.

'The kids lost everything.'

But with the support of her family, Mrs Franklin and the boys have made it out the other side of their year of tragedy.

Mrs Franklin said: 'My son Brandon and I have always been close but since the fire, we have a new bond.

'I think he's come out of himself now that Brian's controlling oppressive force isn't there.

'They're both finally being allowed to be free.

'For me, it's like a new lease of life. I feel like I'm 20 again. The fear has gone.

'I don't know why I didn't do something to end the abuse earlier. 

'I think it's because I've always been a really a strong person and I didn't want to tell people that I was actually weak in some way.

'And I was scared about what he might do. He weighed 18 stone and if he wanted he could really do some damage.

'That's why I want to speak out now. People need to know that they can do something and there is help out there for anyone in an abusive relationship.

'There is light at the end of the tunnel.'
