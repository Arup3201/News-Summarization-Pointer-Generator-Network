This is the man behind the controversial Bang with Friends app which helps Facebook users embark on casual sex.

Until now, Colin Hodge, the man responsible for the app, has remained completely anonymous.

It was perhaps a sensible move by the 28-year-old, who co-founded the app along with Omri Mor.

Bang with Friends brings up pictures of 
your friends on Facebook. Users can then click a button below the 
profile pictures of those people they would like to have sex with.

Controversial: Colin Hodge has been revealed as the man behind the Bang with Friends app which allows people to embark on casual sex relationships

One of the keys to the success of the app is that the friend is only notified of the interest in them if they themselves have also showed interest in their friend's picture.

Mr Hodge now says the app has attracted more than 1 million users, logging in about 70,000 times a day. He also says it has helped more than 200,000 couples get together.

Mr Hodge, who majored in computer science at Cornell, got the idea for Bang with Friends when working on another dating site called HeardAboutYou.

Speaking to Valley Wag, he said women 
complained during customer interviews that they could
not  find casual sex partners without seeming like a 'tramp'.

He said: 'After a few drinks the whole conversation turned to let’s just simplify this. We decided, hey everybody has at least one friend that they’ve had an eye on.'

The co-founders then narrowed the pool to people's Facebook friends. 'From there we came up with the racy logo and decided to just go full speed ahead with making it as funny and straightforward as possible.'

Hodge says he now sees Bang with Friends as being the future of how people can meet other each other.

Hodge and his co-founder had wanted to reveal their identities on a late night talk show. However, last week an event hosted by Internet Week inadvertently outed them.

Despite its apparent success, however, not everything is going well.

Its recently
launched iOS app was suddenly removed from Apple's App Store recently.

Apple cited guideline 16.1, which rejects 'excessively objectionable or crude
content'.

There have also been issues surrounding privacy. A glitch showed which users of Facebook - depending on privacy settings -  had registered with Bang With Friends.
