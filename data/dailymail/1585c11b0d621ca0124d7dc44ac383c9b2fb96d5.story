Secret millionaire: Agnes Brotherston, who lay dead in her flat for up to six months before being discovered, has left a £1m fortune

A pensioner who lay dead in her flat for up to six months before being discovered left a fortune of almost £1million, it has emerged.

Agnes Brotherston, 75, was found in her home in Strathaven, Lanarkshire, Scotland, in November after police were called to the property.

Neighbours of Mrs Brotherston, who lived alone, raised the alarm after noticing an odour and flies coming from the flat.

It was thought she may have been dead since the summer but was only discovered when police officers entered the property.

It has now emerged that she had a fortune of £936,309 at the time of her death.

In her recently published will, Mrs Brotherston instructed that the money should go to her two daughters.

A neighbour said she had not been in touch with her daughters for several years.

Tonight, one of her daughters, Mrs Dyer,  described it as ‘a non-story’.

Her wealth included her £125,000 flat in Strathaven and another £80,000 property in the town.

She also had £350,000 held in several bank accounts, a savings portfolio worth £265,000 and three life insurance portfolios valued at £112,000.

The will, which was drawn up in August, 2011, also shows her furniture and household effects were valued at just £500.

Mrs Brotherston said she wanted her estate to be split between her daughters Helen McInnes, of Glasgow, and Jane Dyer, from Cheshire.

Mrs Dyer, 51, said today: ‘It is a non-story. I don’t want to talk about it.’

A former neighbour of the OAP said: 'It’s a shock that Agnes had so much money, you would never have thought it.

'She lived very quietly and modestly and certainly didn’t give the impression that she was a wealthy lady.

'It was very sad what happened to her.'

Following Mrs Brotherston’s death, neighbours said they had not seen her since the early summer.

Her death was not treated as suspicious and she is thought to have died through natural causes.

At the time, one resident, who didn’t wish to be named, said: 'I can’t believe this has happened here.

'She only moved in earlier in the year and to think of her lying there dead for so long is terrible.

'She used to stay here but then moved away to another part of the village. However she liked Weirs Gate so much that she bought the house which was up for rent at the time.'

In her recently published will, Mrs Brotherston instructed that the money should go to her two daughters. Her neighbours said she lived a quiet and modest life (file picture)

They added: 'She kept herself quiet most of the time but when you got talking to her she was very pleasant and always enjoyed a laugh with people she met.

'The flat must have been full of flies if she’d lay there that long, especially after the hot weather in the summer.'

Another neighbour said: 'She was a bit of a recluse - a solitary woman. No one knew much about her and she didn’t mix with folk.

'It’s sad to think that old lady was lying there all that time and no one missed her. It makes you feel a bit guilty.'

NHS Lanarkshire launched an investigation into Mrs Brotherston’s death as she was thought to be using their care services at the time.

Police Scotland said they had sent a report on her death to the procurator fiscal.
