A female teacher had sex with a 'vulnerable' pupil and plied him with booze and presents has been jailed for two years.

Amardip Bhopari, 28, from Streetly, Birmingham, slept with the 16-year-old in her car, on an industrial estate and even in a school classroom after embarking on the fling.

She met the youngster while working at a school for pupils with learning disabilities and sent him sexual texts after he gave her his phone number.

Bhopal was jailed for two years after admitting three counts of sexual activity with a child at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday.

Judge James Burbidge QC said: 'I do not suggest you sought him out as vulnerable.

'However as a teacher you owed him a duty of care that all teachers must owe to a child.

'You had sex with him in public places, on an industrial estate and hotels and you also provided him with experiences that, as a 16-year-old, meant that he would be attached to you.'

Hugh O'Brien-Quinn, prosecuting, told the court that the defendant started working at the academy in December 2012.

During an art lesson taken by Bhopari the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wrote his number on a piece of paper and gave it to her.

When Bhopari rang the number later that night they had a 'sexual' conversation which continued over the next week.

Just before Valentine's Day 2013 Bhopari lured the teen to her art classroom where she performed a sexual act on him.

They continued their relationship on an industrial estate near the school and had sex several times in her car and at her home.

On the youngster's birthday Bhopari took him to a Formula One hotel where they stayed all day drinking vodka.

Mr O'Brien Quinn told the court that despite the youngster telling her he was not looking for a relationship she continued to pester him with messages asking to meet up.

On one occasion she took him to Drayton Manor Park where she 'paid for everything he wanted' and allowed him to drive her car even though he did not have a licence.

Even when the boy, who suffers from ADHD and dyslexia, started a relationship with a girl his own age and called off the affair Bhopari refused to accept it.

John Smitheman, defending, said Bhopari, who had left the academy as a result of the matters being discovered, was full of remorse.

She had got a job at the school without any teaching qualifications where it appeared she was a great success.

He said 'She fell in love with this young man, they had a relationship. She knew that it was wrong but it happened.'

Bhopari was also ordered to register as a sex offender for ten years.
