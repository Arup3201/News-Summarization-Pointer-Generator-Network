Samantha Stosur's world-famous guns were on full display in Melbourne on Tuesday as she smashed her way into the second round of the Australian Open.

Stosur continued Australia's golden start to the Open with an impressive straight-sets first-round victory over Monica Niculescu.

The 20th seed displayed her impressive upper-body strength as she unleashed a stinging backhand pass and then a forehand winner to snare an early break in the second set before racing away with the match.

Stosur keeps an intensive training schedule to ensure she has enough power to deliver her signature serves.

Outside of tennis practice, Sam also cross-trains with boxing and swimming. 

Her favourite gym exercises include:

- Squats

- Leg press

- Jumping lunges

- Seated box jumps

- Inverted rows

- Olympic deadlifts

- Battle rope waves

- Medicine ball slams 

In an interview with ESPN last year Stosur said she often got stopped at the gym by women asking her how she got her killer biceps.

'It's always about my arms and how I got them,' she said,

'But there's really no secret. I work out in the gym, and I've hit millions and millions of tennis balls in my lifetime, so I guess I'm lucky that they've gone that way.'

Off the court Stosur does a mixture of gym, swimming and boxing workouts to stay in shape.

She works out at least once a day - more if she's not playing tennis - but insists she doesn't spend the majority of her time lifting weights and makes sure she gets a full body workout.

A video posted to her Facebook page earlier this month shows the 20th seed doing squats, jumping lunges, medicine ball slams, inverted rows, battle rope waves, Olympic lifts and seated box jumps.

 On Tuesday, Stosur outclassed Romanian Niculescu 6-4 6-1 in 79 minutes to book a second-round meeting on Thursday against veteran Italian Francesca Schiavone or young American Coco Verdeweghe.

The former US Open champion is bidding to progress beyond the fourth round at Melbourne Park for the first time in 13 attempts.

'Obviously I've had my struggles,' Stosur said.

'There's obviously a few more nerves here in a grand slam but I did alright.'

The 20th seed's win gives Australia eight players in the second round, with four more playing later on Tuesday.

With the pressure on to deliver after early exits - again - in Brisbane and Sydney, Stosur made an understandably nervous start, shanking a couple of groundstrokes early and having to save a break point in her second service game.

But once she adjusted to Niculescu's unusual, squash-style forehand slice, she was able to dictate proceedings.

Australia's only other seed, Casey Dellacqua, also begins her campaign on Tuesday.

The 29th seed plays Austria's world No.93 Yvonne Meusburger, while Olivia Rogowska takes on the 96th-ranked Nicole Gibbs of the USA.

Lining up for his 19th straight Open, Lleyton Hewitt meets Chinese wildcard Zhang Ze in the first night match on Rod Laver Arena before adopted Aussie Ana Tomjlanovic plays American qualifier Shelby Rogers.
