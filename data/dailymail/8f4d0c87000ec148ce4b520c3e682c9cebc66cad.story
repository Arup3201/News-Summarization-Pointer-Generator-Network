Proud Melbourne mum Hiranthi Wijesinha is still pinching herself after specialists successfully performed a rare life-saving operation on her unborn twins Polly and Lucy in the womb.

The need for surgery arose during Ms Wijesinha's pregnancy because her girls were sharing the same placenta.

The Melbourne Royal Women's Hospital Dr Stephen Cole and a team of specialists from two other Victorian hospitals from the Victorian Fetal Therapy Service worked together on the operation.

'Essentially blood can flow freely between the babies and that can cause problems,' Dr Cole told MailOnline of twins sharing a placenta.

This can affect how much blood the babies can get and also means what happens to one baby can affect the other.

In Ms Wijesinha's case, Polly had a larger share of the blood supply, which meant Lucy was at risk of not surviving in the womb.

'Had Lucy passed away, because of the blood flow, it could have impacted on Polly, who would have been at risk of passing away,' Dr Cole said. 'It would have been a disaster.'

As part of the surgery, doctors inserted a telescope into Ms Wijesinha's abdomen and into her uterus.

On average just two of these life-saving operations are performed in Victorian hospitals each year

'Through the telescope, we could look and see blood vessels that connected the two babies through the placenta. We passed a laser fibre through the telescope to seal off the connecting vessels,' Dr Cole said.

'This ends uneven sharing of blood between the babies.'

The operation also meant that if Lucy had still died in the womb, Polly would not be affected. 'That was the aim,' Dr Cole said.

While the surgery is not unheard of, Dr Cole said there were only up to two a year completed in Victoria each year.

'It worked well and what we hoped to achieve, although we did not necessarily expect it, it was what we were working towards,' Dr Cole said.

The surgery also enabled the pregnancy to progress longer, which benefited the development of the babies, but due to Ms Wijesinha's pre-eclampsia, doctors endued a premature pregnancy on May 6.

Ms Wijesinha, 42, said she had serious doubts that Lucy would survive the pregnancy.

'Right until the night before they were born, we were talking to palliative care about Lucy and we didn't expect her to be here today,' she said. 'We talked about resuscitation if she wasn't breathing.'

'It was definitely a relief,' she said of both girls being born alive and healthy.

Polly was born weighing 1.4 kilograms and is now 2.3 kilograms, while Lucy was just 568 grams at birth.

But Ms Wijesinha said with both girls born premature, they had done exceptionally well. 'Lucy is pretty much doing really really well. She had a stomach infection but she's over that now,' she said.

'She's now nearly a kilo and that was a few days ago so I'm hoping she hits a kilo next week. From the picture we took when they were two days old, til now is completely different.'

Ms Wijesinha said she also had to opportunity to see Dr Cole after the girls were born.

'He came in the day the day after they were born to see me in the room and he was very surprised that little Lucy was still going and quite well,' she said.

'I was really quite grateful he took time out to see how I was and how the girls were.'

Despite being discharged four days after the birth, Ms Wijesinha has returned to hospital everyday since to be with her girls.

'Polly is very close to coming home, potentially Monday. They were born at 31 weeks, so she'll only be 37 weeks when she goes home so its surprising everyone,' she said.

'She's started feeding occasionally when she was 34 - 35 weeks.'

But she said although Lucy was doing well and progressing, she was expected to be in hospital longer.

'It will be a little while yet before she gets to feed the way Polly is... and it will still be a while before she comes,' she said.

'It's still too early to discuss because she's in the isolette'.
