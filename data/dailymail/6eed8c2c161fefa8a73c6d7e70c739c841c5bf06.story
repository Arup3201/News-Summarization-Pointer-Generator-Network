James Packer, Australia's wealthiest man and one of the richest people on earth, has split from his former model wife Erica Baxter in a shock announcement issued today on the eve of his 46th birthday.

The billionaire son of the late media mogul Kerry Packer - a fierce opponent of Rupert Murdoch - is rated 198th on the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest people following his investments in casinos in Asia and Australia.

Miss Baxter, 36, mother of Mr Packer's three children, has moved out of their £30million home - completed just eight weeks ago - on the shores of Sydney harbour and has travelled to Los Angeles with children Indigo, five, Jackson, three and Emmanuelle, who will be one later this month.

A statement issued to Sydney's Daily Telegraph said simply: 'It is with great sadness that Erica and James Packer announce their separation.

'We remain deeply close friends and incredibly proud parents and our children are our priority going forward.'

A source told Fairfax Media that there were no third parties involved.

The source said: 'Erica and the kids are in LA and James is planning to spend a lot of his time there over the next few months.

'They're friends and they want to make sure they will stay friends. The kids are their priority. It's that simple.

'Any separation is traumatic but because this will attract so much publicity, they're determined to do their best to shield the kids and look after them, first and foremost.'

While Sydney's Daily Telegraph referred to the couple as having already divorced, Fairfax said they had separated.

But friends agreed that the split was permanent, even though the couple say they will remain friends.

The announcement comes two months after Mr Packer, who has an estimated personal fortune of £4billion, won a government licence to build a £1billion casino-resort beside Sydney harbour.

Celebrity-watchers had first spotted Miss Baxter in Los Angeles without Mr Packer in July and a few days later she flew alone to Paris.

The couple married in a multi-million pound ceremony in the South of France in 2007, with Tom Cruise and his then-wife Katie Holmes in attendance along with a number of high profile people, including Rupert Murdoch.

Miss Baxter had once had a relationship with Mr Packer's friend, British casino heir Damian Aspinall.

Mr Packer has had colourful relationships, having dated a number of models while in his 20s.
