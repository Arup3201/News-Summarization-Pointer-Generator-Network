Aboriginal leader Noel Pearson, 49, delivered a eulogy for the ages in honour of Gough Whitlam on Wednesday, referring in most reverent terms to Australia 21st prime minister as 'this old man' who was 'truly Australia's greatest white elder'.

As he listed off the Whitlam achievements one-by-one, he told the congregation in Sydney's Town Hall and those watching in Melbourne, Canberra and Cabramatta, that Gough Whitlam provided equalities and opportunities to his people, unmatched before or since.

Those present were held spellbound by the Martin Luther King-esque oratory, in which the renowned lawyer and academic announced 'I don’t know why someone with this old man’s upper-middle class background could carry such a burning conviction that the barriers of class and race of the Australia of his upbringing and maturation should be torn down and replaced with the unapologetic principle of equality'.

'When he breathed he truly was Australia's greatest white elder and friend without peer to the original Australians' Noel Pearson said of late former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam

Australian's Aboriginal community turned out in numbers to pay tribute to former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at the State Memorial Service in Sydney

Many people had to be turned away from the spill-over in the St Andrew's courtyard to watch the State Memorial Service for former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam

'I can scarcely point to any white Australian political leader of his vintage and of generations following of whom it could be said without a shadow of doubt, he harboured not a bone of racial ethnic or gender prejudice in his body.'

Mr Pearson outlined how important the Whitlam overhaul of discrimination laws was to Australia's indigenous communities.

'Raised next to the wood-heap of the nation's democracy, bequeathed no allegiance to no political party I speak to this old man's legacy with no partisan brief,' he announced.

'Rather, my signal honour today on behalf of more people than I could ever know, is to express our immense gratitude for the public service of this old man.

'Outlawing the discrimination that my father and his father lived under since my grandfather was removed to the mission as a boy.'

He would go on to tell the story of when, in 1976, in the western Cape York peninsular, Aboriginal farmer John Kuwata sought to buy a pastoral lease from its white owner but the Queensland Government refused the sale. The High Court, however, upheld the then Racial Discrimination Act.

'However, in an act of spite the Queensland Government converted the lease into national park,' he stated.

'John Kuwata died a broken man. The winner of a landmark High Court precedent but the victim of an appalling discrimination.

'Without this old man, the land and human rights of our people would never have seen the light of day.

'There would never have been Mabo and its importance to the history of Australia would have been lost without the Whitlam program.

'Only those who have known discrimination truly know its evil.

'Only those who have never experienced prejudice can discount the importance of the Racial Discrimination Act. This old man was one of those rare people who never suffered discrimination but understood the importance of protection from its malice.'

His next statement drew a rousing reception.

Emotional times. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd listens intently as speakers, including Noel Pearson and Cate Blanchett, pay tribute to Gough Whitlam

'The Whitlam Government is the text-book case of reform trumping management,' he stated.

'In less than three years, an astonishing reform agenda, leapt off the policy platform and into legislation and the machinery and programs of government.

'The country would change forever, the modern cosmopolitan Australia finally emerged like a technicolour butterfly from its long dormant chrysalis.

'And 38 years later we are like John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin's Jewish Insurgence ranting against the despotic rule of Rome, defiantly demanding "and what did the Romans ever do for us anyway?"

'Apart from Medibank and the Trade Practices Act, cutting tariff protections, no-fault divorce and the family law act, the Australia Council, the Federal Court, the Order of Australia, federal legal aid, the racial discrimination act, needs-based school funding, the recognition of China, the abolition of conscription, the law reform commission, student financial assistance, the heritage commission, non discriminatory immigration laws, community health clinics, Aboriginal land rights, paid maternity leave for public servants, lowering the minimum voting age to 18 years and fair electoral boundaries and senate representation for the territories ... apart from all this, what did this Roman ever do for us?'

Mr Pearson,  founder of the Cape York Institute for Policy, told those listening that Mr Whitlam was before his time.

'There is no need for nostalgia and yearning for what might have been,' he said.

'The achievements of this old man are present in the institutions we today take for granted and played no small part in the progress in modern Australia

'There is no need to regret three years was too short, was any more time needed?

'The breadth and depth of the reforms secured in that short and tumultuous period were unprecedented and will likely never again be repeated.

'The devil-may-care attitude to management as opposed to reform is unlikely to be seen again by governments whose priorities are to retain power rather than reform.

'We could not be more indebted to this old man's foresight and moral vision for universal opportunity.

'We salute this old man for his great love and dedication to his country and to the Australian people. 

'When he breathed he truly was Australia's greatest white elder and friend without peer to the original Australians.'
