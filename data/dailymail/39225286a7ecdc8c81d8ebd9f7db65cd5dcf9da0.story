Diego Simeone could celebrate getting Atletico Madrid into the quarter-finals of the Champions League by signing a new contract with the club until 2020, according to his sister and representative Natalia.

Simeone led Atletico to the league title and the Champions League final last year and has been on the radar of both Manchester United and Manchester City in the past year and Chelsea before they re-hired Jose Mourinho.

But it now seems that he will pen a new deal at the Vicente Calderon and disappoint his Premier League suitors.

Natalia Simeone told Cadena Cope: ‘We need to enjoy [this victory over Bayer Leverkusen] but if all goes well supporters who love Atletico will have some other good news to celebrate very soon.

‘My brother always makes his decisions based on football. He has a choice to make and I think he has made the right choice. His decisions are always intelligent ones.’

Simeone’s latest wise choice was to give Fernando Torres the last penalty in Atletico Madrid’s dramatic shootout with Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday night.
