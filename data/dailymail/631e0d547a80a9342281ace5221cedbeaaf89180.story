The fragile Tory truce over Europe disintegrated last night after it emerged that more than 100 Conservative MPs and candidates are set to defy David Cameron at the General Election next year by vowing to leave the EU.

The Prime Minister has promised the Tory manifesto will spell out his pledge for a referendum by 2017 on Britain’s links with Europe after trying to win back key powers from Brussels.

But Tory rebels will go further and make their own personal manifesto vows to campaign to withdraw from the EU – regardless of any concessions by Brussels.

David Cameron faces the threat of at least 100 of his own MPs vowing to leave the EU after the next election. Kent MP Mark Reckless (right) says Britain should leave whatever deal is struck with the EU

It is a major rebuff for Mr Cameron, who hoped his referendum commitment would stop open warfare over Europe during the campaign.

The rebels were to declare their provocative plan after May’s European Parliament elections, when they are expected to lose seats to UKIP, but the move was leaked to The Mail on Sunday.

The rebels say Mr Cameron should not accuse them of disloyalty because when he first stood for Parliament in 1997, then Prime Minister John Major begged Tory candidates to back his pledge not to have his hands tied on whether Britain should join the proposed euro, which was launched in 1999.

Mr Cameron was among many who refused, pledging to rule out joining the single currency.Rochester Tory MP Mark Reckless said last night he would vow to vote to quit the EU – and ignore  Mr Cameron’s plan to renegotiate membership.

Rebel MPs say their stand is similar to Mr Cameron's own stance on John Major's demands on the euro in 1999

Mr Reckless, currently conducting his own EU referendum in his Kent constituency, said: ‘There is no prospect of being able to remake the EU in a way that is acceptable to Britain. We are going to have an in/out referendum by 2017 and I will vote to come out.’

Another Conservative MP, who asked not to be named, said: ‘We will loyally refer to Mr Cameron’s hopes of a new settlement with Brussels in our manifestos, but the message will be clear – vote for us and we will vote to get our sovereignty back and go it alone without the dead hand of Brussels.’

A third Tory said: ‘When it suited Mr Cameron to make a firm statement against the euro in his 1997 manifesto... he went ahead and did it. So will we. He would not be so ill-judged to try to stop us, as it would leave him vulnerable to the charge of hypocrisy.’
