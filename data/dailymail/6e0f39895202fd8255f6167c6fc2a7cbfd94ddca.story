The Social Security Administration has blown through nearly $300 million to create a new computer system to handle disability claims -- and the Lockheed Martin-led project still doesn't work.

Six years ago the Social Security Administration embarked on an aggressive plan to replace outdated computer systems overwhelmed by a growing flood of disability claims.

Today, the new system is nowhere near ready and agency officials are struggling to salvage a project racked by delays and mismanagement, according to an internal report commissioned by the agency.

In 2008, Social Security said the project was about two to three years from completion. Five years later, it was still two to three years from being done, according to the report by McKinsey and Co., a management consulting firm.

Today, with the project still in the testing phase, the agency can't say when it will be completed or how much it will cost.

Hot seat: Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colver's agency has failed to implement a new computer system to handle disability claims - despite spending $288million

In the meantime, people filing for 
disability claims face long delays at nearly every step of the process —
 delays that were supposed to be reduced by the new processing system.

'The
 program has invested $288 million over six years, delivered limited 
functionality, and faced schedule delays as well as increasing 
stakeholder concerns,' the report said.

As
 a result, agency leaders have decided to 'reset' the program in an 
effort to save it, the report said. As part of that effort, Social 
Security brought in the outside consultants from McKinsey to figure out 
what went wrong.

They
 found a massive technology initiative with no one in charge — no single
 person responsible for completing the project. They issued their report
 in June, though it was not publicly released.

As
 part of McKinsey's recommendations, acting Social Security Commissioner
 Carolyn Colvin appointed Terrie Gruber to oversee the project last 
month. Gruber had been an assistant deputy commissioner.

'We
 asked for this, this independent look, and we weren't afraid to hear 
what the results are,' Gruber said in an interview Wednesday. 'We are 
absolutely committed to deliver this initiative and by implementing the 
recommendations we obtained independently, we think we have a very good 
prospect on doing just that.'

Fail! After some six years, Social Security officials still don't know how much longer their beleaguered new software will take to be finished

The revelations come at an awkward time for Colvin. President Barack Obama nominated Colvin to a full six-year term in June, and she now faces confirmation by the Senate. Colvin was deputy commissioner for 3½ years before becoming acting commissioner in February 2013.

The House Oversight Committee is also looking into the program, and whether Social Security officials tried to bury the McKinsey report. In a letter to Colvin on Wednesday, committee leaders requested all documents and communications about the computer project since March 1.

The letter was signed by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the Oversight committee, and Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and James Lankford, R-Okla. They called the project 'an IT boondoggle.'

The troubled computer project is known
 at the Disability Case Processing System, or DCPS. It was supposed to 
replace 54 separate, antiquated computer systems used by state Social 
Security offices to process disability claims. As envisioned, workers 
across the country would be able to use the system to process claims and
 track them as benefits are awarded or denied, and claims are appealed.

But
 as of April, the system couldn't even process all new claims, let alone
 accurately track them as they wound their way through the system, the 
report said. In all, more than 380 problems were still outstanding, and 
users hadn't even started testing the ability of the system to handle 
applications from children.

'The DCPS project is adrift, the scope of the project is ambiguous, the project has been poorly executed, and the project's development lacks leadership,' the three lawmakers said in their letter to Colvin.

Maryland-based Lockheed Martin was 
selected in 2011 as the prime contractor on the project. At the time, 
the company valued the contract at up to $200 million, according to a 
press release.

McKinsey's
 report does not specifically fault Lockheed but raises the possibility 
of changing vendors, and says Social Security officials need to better 
manage the project.

Gruber 
said Social Security will continue to work with Lockheed 'to make sure 
that we are successful in the delivery of this program.'

Steve Field, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin, would only say that the company is committed to delivering the program.

The report comes as the disability program edges toward the brink of insolvency. The trust fund that supports Social Security's disability program is projected to run out of money in 2016. At that point, the system will collect only enough money in payroll taxes to pay 80 percent of benefits, triggering an automatic 20 percent cut in benefits.

Congress could redirect money from Social Security's much bigger retirement program to shore up the disability program, as it did in 1994. But that would worsen the finances of the retirement program, which is facing its own long-term financial problems.

Social Security disability claims are first processed through a network of field offices and state agencies called Disability Determination Services. There are 54 of these offices, and they all use different computer systems, Gruber said.

If your claim is rejected, you can ask the state agency to reconsider. If your claim is rejected again, you can appeal to an administrative law judge, who is employed by Social Security.

It takes more than 100 days, on average, to processing initial applications, according to agency data. The average processing time for a hearing before an administrative law judge is more than 400 days.

The new processing system is supposed to help alleviate some of these delays.
