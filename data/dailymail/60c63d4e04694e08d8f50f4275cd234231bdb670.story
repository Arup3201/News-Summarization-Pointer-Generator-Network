A father whose wife and three children were killed in a suspected arson attack said his 'heart was crying' as he thanked mourners for attending a funeral service.

An estimated 7,000 people gathered in Leicester’s Spinney Hill Park to pay their respects to the memory of Shehnila Taufiq, 47, and her three teenage children, Zainab, Bilal and Jamil.

Mrs Taufiq’s husband, Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar, was among those who addressed the half-hour service, thanking mourners and police for their support since the deaths of his wife and children.

Speaking during the service, Dr 
Sattar, who works in Dublin as a neurosurgeon, told mourners: 'It’s a 
sad day, my heart is crying.

'I would like to thank all of you for coming.

'I
know our hearts are breaking but all the brothers and sisters are with 
me, everybody from Leicester from all denominations, outside Leicester 
and throughout the world.'

The
funeral prayers, taking place ahead of a burial service in Dublin at 
the weekend, were open to the public so that members of the local 
community could attend.

Shehnila, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and 
sons Bilal, 17, and  15-year-old Jamil were killed in a fire at their home in Leicester when Mr Sattar was working away in 
Dublin.

Seven people have been charged with murdering the four family members, who died in the blaze at their home in Wood Hill, Leicester, on September 13.

Speaking last month, Dr Al Sattar said his devout  Muslim faith had ‘been tested’, but he was able to draw comfort from the belief that his family are now ‘in paradise’.

Shaun Carter, 24, Jackson Powell, 19, and Nathaniel Mullings, also 19, as well as a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, face four charges of murder in relation to the fire in the early hours of Friday, September 13.

Kemo Porter, 18, has also been charged with four counts of murder in relation to the blaze.
