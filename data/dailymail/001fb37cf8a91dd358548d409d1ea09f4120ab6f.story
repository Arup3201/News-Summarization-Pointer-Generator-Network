Richard Muzira died after being knocked from his bicycle by a lorry in Camberwell last night. He was a keen volunteer who once donated at £3,000 prize to a charity he worked with

The sixth cyclist killed in London in the last two weeks was an 'real hero' who worked as a volunteer for a mental health charity, colleagues said today.

Richard Muzira, father of two and volunteer filmmaker at CoolTan Arts, died after being dragged under the wheels of a tipper truck at a busy junction on Camberwell Road in South London just after noon on Monday.

His name was released as new measures were announced to combat the recent spate of cyclist deaths on the capital's roads.

Specialist traffic officers will be out in force on every major street, especially notorious junctions like the Bow roundabout where a cyclist died last week.

From Monday, they will be on the lookout for motorists using mobile phones, drivers stopping in 'bike boxes' at traffic lights and cyclists riding on the inside of HGVs.

The decision was taken at a meeting between the Metropolitan Police Service and City Hall last night.

Speaking this afternoon Michelle Baharier, the chief executive at CoolTan Arts, said the vulnerable people the group works with had been hit hard by the loss of Mr Muzira.

She said: 'It's absolutely, one million per cent devastating. It really, really is, he was a real hero, he was fantastic, such wonderful human being, he was just one of the best and we had worked together for a long time.

'He was really caring, really supportive, he was very helpful to everyone, he was very passionate, he had a great sense of humour and we shared a lot of laughs together.

'We are a MAD organisation, which stands for Mental Health and Disability, and it has really affected us a lot.'

She added: 'It has been a hard year for CoolTan. We had three people take their own lives and two die from self-neglect, we are all distraught, it's going to be very difficult for the people we work with to come to terms with this.

'When anybody dies it affects a lot of people, but Richard's death will impact a big group of people who will struggle with it, they are too upset.'

Mr Muzira, a Zimbabwean in his 60s who lived in London for decades and worked for the organisation for seven years, was a keen cyclist. Ms Baharier added: 'The Government will not make segregated cycle lanes so cars and lorries drive into people on bikes and kill them, it's that simple.

'He loved to cycle, he had his house burgled earlier this year and his bike was stolen so we made a collection to help him save up for a new one.'

She added: 'He regularly volunteered at the centre and won a £3,000 prize from the Bank of America in recognition for his work.

'He
was a unique, special, beautiful person. You just cant imagine a 
more beautiful, selfless, human being, he was a big part of the team.

'We are gutted, it's such a shock and such a sad tragedy.'

As the new safety measures were announced, London Mayor Boris Johnson said he thought cyclists using headphones while riding on London's streets are an 'absolute scourge' and he would not be against banning them.

He said: 'I'm very alarmed about cyclists wearing headphones,' he told BBC London 94.9 today.

'I would not be against a prohibition or ban on cyclists wearing headphones.

'Call me illiberal but it makes me absolutely terrified to see them bowling along unable to hear the traffic.'

Police officers remove the bike, which was been twisted in the accident

Authorities pushed through the new policing measure despite previously saying real progress on safety would come with a £35 million scheme for segregated lanes to be built next year.

But the Mayor’s cycling commissioner, Andrew Gilligan, told the Evening Standard the actions are a must if the startling spate of deaths is to be halted.

He said: 'This is a new zero-tolerance approach with a police officer on every main road in central London from Monday which is a huge escalation to the checks we are doing already.

'They will be stopping lorries and cars and where there is unsafe driving they will be taken off the road. We will also target unsafe cyclists. It is a short-term measure but the Mayor and the police feel we must act as a result of the recent spate of appalling accidents.'

One witness, a man who declined to be named, saw the aftermath of the accident that killed Mr Murza. He said: 'I came past and saw people panicking around the side of the lorry.

'He was trapped under the wheels at the back of the truck, people were screaming, there was nothing that they could do.

'The lorry looks like it was turning left and he just went straight under.

'The paramedics came but he was crushed under the wheels, there wasn't much they could do.'

What was left of his twisted road bike could be seen caught under the driver's cab.

An eyewitness described seeing 'white chinos' sticking out from underneath the cab. James, who refused to give his surname, was travelling home to Dulwich on the bus when he saw the aftermath of the accident.

He said: 'There were a lot of buses queued up, people were looking the windows as the paramedics worked on him.

'We didn't know if he was dead or alive, all we could see was his white chinos. The paramedics were working on him as shocked people just stood and watched.

'When you think you're having a bad day and you see that on the way home it makes you think.'

Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Dave, said: 'The first I heard of it was a woman making a wailing noise. She was very near to the junction and there was loads of screaming. I looked out and saw the lorry.

'There were sirens everywhere and someone said a cyclist was trapped under the lorry. It's still out there now.

'A lot of police vehicles were there and then they were putting up a tent so that people didn't see the cyclist.

'They've closed a lot of roads down and I think they're trying to get the cyclist out from underneath.

'The ambulance seems to have disappeared, but there are still a load of police around.

'Cycling is so dangerous in London, people just don't see you,' added Dave, who used to cycle but is now a regular motorcyclist.

'Cyclists are much more vulnerable because they go quite slow, but turning left is always risky.'

Collision: Roger William De Klerk, 43, an IT consultant and courier, of Forest Hill, south east London was killed in Croydon on Tuesday when he was hit by a bus while cycling on tramways

The death takes the number of to be killed in London to six in just 14 days.

On November 5th hospital porter Brian Holt, 62, died on Mile End Road in east London as he cycled along Cycle Superhighway 2.

He was crushed by a tipper lorry as it moved off from stationary during the evening rush hour.

Three days later architect Francis Golding, 69, died after a crash with a coach in Holborn, central London on November 5th.

The

crushed by a single-decker bus outside East Croydon station in south 
London.

The next day Venera 
Minakhmetova, a Russian entrepreneur died after being hit by a lorry at

That
evening a 21 year old man from St John's Wood was hit by a bus at 
11.30pm in Aldgate, near the Cycle Superhighway 2. He died the following

The latest death means 14 cyclists have died on London's roads so far this year.

In 2012, there were 14 cyclists' deaths, while in 2011 a total of 16 cyclists were killed.

Last week the Mayor of London was accused of shirking his responsibility and insensitivity after saying cyclists should 'think of the laws of the road' after a spate of deaths involving cyclists in the capital.

Speaking just hours after the fifth cyclist died as a result of a crash on London's roads in just nine days, Boris Johnson appeared to blame cyclists, saying their 'hasty, rash decisions' were 'endangering' their lives.

The mayor's comments came hours after a man died after being hit by a double-decker bus in Whitechapel, east London, the second casualty on London's roads in less than 24 hours.

The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) has called on Mr Johnson to take 'urgent action' to make cyclists safer.
