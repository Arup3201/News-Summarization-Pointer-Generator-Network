Made in Britain (or will be)... Production of Golden Wonder's The Nation's Noodles will move from China to Leeds

A British food producer is moving its production of instant noodles from China to Britain after discovering it can make them just as cheaply at home.

Symington's, which makes Golden Wonder's dehydrated The Nation's Noodles, Normous Noodles, Naked Noodles, and Mug Shots, is cancelling its contracts with factories in Guangzhou, on the banks of the Pearl River, and Hangzhou, and preparing to manufacture them in Britain.

The Leeds-based  firm says rising wages in China, plus the increasing cost and inconvenience of shipping the noodles back here, are behind its decision to move noodle production to the UK after seven years.

Henrik Pade, business development 
manager at Symington's, said: 'We can produce for roughly the same cost 
today in Yorkshire as we are out of China.

'If you go back in time, it would probably have been 30-35 per cent less [in China].'

He also told the FT
the decision to make the noodles at a new factory in Leeds was also 
influenced by the need for quicker response times.

The move by Symington's is the latest
example of 're-shoring' - the opposite of 'off-shoring' - whereby production is relocated back home from
China because it is cheaper to do so.

One British manufacturer is selling 
rice cookers to China, while Toyota produces cars in its factory near 
Derby for export to Japan.

The strengthening of Asian markets 
contrasts with the weakening of the pound, making home-based production 
more attractive than ever to UK-based manufacturers.

Wages have been steadily rising in China
over the last decade, meaning it is no longer the obvious choice for 
those looking to make things cheaply.

Leeds, with its City Hall shown here, will benefit from 50 new jobs when the noodle factory opens in August

Five years ago, Symington's brought the packaging of the noodle pots to Britain from China, and other companies are following suit.

Stoke-on-Trent MP Tristram Hunt says more British companies are looking at bringing their manufacturing back to the UK, and says it could be the start of Britain's 'reindustrialisation'.

The move by Symington's will be a blow to China but a boost to the local economy in Leeds, with the creation of around 50 jobs when the noodle factory opens in August.

A survey by UK manufacturers' association EEF in 2011 showed that one in seven was bringing some work back home from overseas.
