This is the dramatic moment a brave lifeboat helmsman leaps from a sinking trawler moments after rescuing stranded fishermen.

Courageous Pete Slidel threw himself into the English Channel just seconds before the two-man vessel plunged beneath the waves two miles off the coast of Portsmouth, Hampshire.

The lifeboat crewman had just rescued the terrified crew but was himself left swimming desperately alongside the sinking ship.

Jump: A fisherman leaps into the lifeboat (in yellow) but misses his target, ending up in the sea for a few seconds before he is pulled out

Moments to spare: Seconds after lifeboat crewman Pete Slidel jumps from a fishing trawler and into a lifeboat, the vessel founders two miles off the coast of Langstone Harbour, near Portsmouth, yesterday

No hesitation: Just minutes earlier, Mr Slidel boards a sinking fishing trawler that had sent out a Mayday signal

He was then picked up by a second rescue boat while his own lifeboat ferried the fishermen to dry land.

Mr Slidel said: 'Even my own entrance onto the vessel was quite dramatic. At that point the boat was still making its own way and taking on water.

'I spoke to the skipper and we proceeded to the nearest land but within seconds the engine had stopped and failed.

'I gave the instruction to leave the vessel immediately. The first man went to jump and literally fell into the lifeboat, which was then pushed away.

'Next was the skipper, he jumped in but again the lifeboat was pushed away.

'The vessel then suddenly started to sink. Seconds before they came close enough to get me I had to abandon the vessel as it started to turn over.

'There was no time for fear - it was just a case of making calm judgements and risk assessments about what could happen next.'

Rescued: The skipper of the sinking vessel boards the lifeboat with an armful of important documents

The trawler had been out potting crabs two miles south of Langstone Harbour near Portsmouth when it suddenly started taking on water just before 3pm yesterday afternoon.

The lifeboat Norma T was on its way back from routine training when the frantic Mayday call went out over the radio.

The crew was on the scene within minutes but by the time they arrived the fishing trawler was already starting to sink on its starboard side and its crew were urgently waving a hand-held flare.

Lifeguards said the vessel was only kept afloat by its forward moment when Mr Slidel hurled himself headlong over the rail and onto the deck to save the stranded fishermen.

However, as he himself prepared to escape, the engine failed sending the boat plunging below the sealine.

Danger: With Mr Slidel still on board, the boat lists to one side and is clearly on the verge of disappearing beneath the waves

Close shave: Filmed from another lifeboat, the vessel sinks seconds after Mr Slidel has jumped into the water and is picked up by his colleagues

RNLI volunteer Mr Slidel was left swimming through rough seas before he was picked up by a nearby boat from Gosport Rescue.

However, even after the trying ordeal the life-saver remained at the scene to salvage debris and place a buoy warning other seafarers of the sunken wreckage lying below the waterline.

He said: 'It wasn’t until a couple of hours later when I was having dinner round at a friend’s house and reviewing the footage that I started shaking and was overcome by the incident.

'I was just thinking back on how quickly it happened - how quickly the boat went away from underneath us.

'If both lifeboats hadn’t partly been already afloat when we got the call we would have been picking the fisherman up from out of the water.'

Mr Slidel today met the fishermen he saved and said they were extremely grateful for his brave actions.
