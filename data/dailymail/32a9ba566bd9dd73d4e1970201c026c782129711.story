Former Chelsea trainee Billy Knott was part of the Bradford City side which triumphed at Stamford Bridge.

He left the club as a 17-year-old following a serious breach of discipline. Five years on and Knott has rebuilt his career and is now one of the stars of Phil Parkinson's side, playing a key role during their shock 4-2 victory in Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie.

Here, the Canvey Island-born midfielder reflects on his weekend with Sportsmail.

'No-one felt any pressure really and we went there to enjoy the day - that was always the message.

'But at the same time we had a game-plan and intended to stick to it. Even at 2-0 down I thought we were playing well.

'At that point I was actually still really enjoying the game because I thought we were doing okay, we certainly weren't falling to pieces.

'When we got to 2-1 before half-time it was huge though. We came out for the second half full of belief and when we equalised it was just incredible, although it was deserved.

'I went off at 2-2 but it was always going to be the way that the substitutes played a massive part, and they won us the game.

'I was kicking every ball after that. I mean, winning at Chelsea just doesn't happen. What we achieved is unbelievable. But I honestly think we deserved to win.

'At the same time, they were excellent. The way they move the ball makes it so hard. You don't tackle, you just end up trying to block passes or cut off the space, they are so good.

'When Cesc Fabregas came on I was a bit star-struck, he's one of my idols.

'To win against that side – with so many world-class players – is probably the biggest achievement of our careers.

'It's amazing for the lads, the gaffer, the club and the fans.

'Mourinho was brilliant afterwards. He came in the dressing-room and shook everyone's hand. He told us to make sure we enjoy the day and wished us luck in the next round. It was really classy and the lads loved it.

'We were singing and dancing and the chairman sent some champagne down – the scenes were incredible.

'John Terry gave me his signed shirt and my dad is going to frame that with my shirt and the programme and scarf and match ticket to put up in the house.

'I went back to Canvey Island on the bus with all my friends and family afterwards – that was some journey. It was unreal. My dad, Steve, had organised it and they had some day.

'We went out on Saturday night to our local pubs, the Windjammer and Oyster Bay. I didn't have to buy a drink all night!

'Like Jose told us, we had a fair few beers and enjoyed it - my fiancée had to send me home to bed in the end!

'Then on Sunday it was mum, Michelle, her 51st birthday so all the family went out again. She's a Chelsea fan though so she's the only one who hasn't enjoyed it as much as everyone else, but my dad is a fully signed up Bradford fan.

'We just can't wait for the draw now. It was so special going back to Chelsea. A lot has been made of me leaving there but that is in the past and Saturday was amazing, the best day of my career.

'Now I want West Ham in the next round, another one of my old clubs.

'But look at the teams left in, a lot of big boys have gone, why can't we go all the way?'
