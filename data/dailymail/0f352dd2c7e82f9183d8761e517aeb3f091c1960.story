If Brazil was a destination Rickie Lambert could never have envisaged appearing on the landscape this time last year, the same could surely be said of his native Liverpool.

Twelve months on, after firmly establishing himself as one of the Barclays Premier League’s most accomplished strikers, both are dominating the skyline for the 32-year old. Not only is he Brazil-bound with England’s World Cup squad, he’s heading there as a Liverpool player.

It is a remarkable development for the former Southampton frontrunner, and if he was even more taken aback by Liverpool’s £4million outlay than the call-up from Roy Hodgson, he was not alone.

Change of heart? Brendan Rodgers allowed Carroll to leave Liverpool because he didn't fit the club's ethos

After making Andy Carroll’s departure the main priority on taking over at Anfield, few expected Brendan Rodgers’ summer spending plans to include an archetypal bustling British No 9.

He will argue they don’t, despite Lambert set to sign a two-year deal with last season’s runners-up after passing a medical. In Rodgers’ view, Lambert does not fit the description. While Carroll needs a steady supply of aerial ammunition to make his mark, Anfield’s latest acquisition has a far more varied game that will slot seamlessly into the Rodgers way.

‘He has probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘He is probably seen as a traditional big No 9, a typical British striker, but he is actually one of the most accomplished footballers I have seen.

‘Look at his touch and the different types of goals he scores. He is a terrific player, one with a lot to offer.’

There can be little doubt part of the appeal for Rodgers lies in Lambert’s ability to offer an alternative approach, should Liverpool’s slick passing style flounder against the sort of safety-first approach that proved so effective for Chelsea at Anfield last season.

Dismal: Carroll has had a tough time in front of goal and with injuries since a £15m move to the Hammers

On that plane! Lambert, on the other hand, is ready to embark on the World Cup in Brazil at the age of 32

He can put himself about and ruffle defences with the most robust of aerial challenges. But while Carroll’s threat basically boils down to winning headers, Lambert is nothing like as one-dimensional.

Not only is he a far more dynamic prospect when spearheading an attack, the new man scores more goals, registers more assists and fires off more shots. The pair's minutes per goal ratio is barely comparable.

Comfortable with the ball at his feet, Lambert holds it up adeptly for others and has an eye for a pass that contributed significantly to Jay Rodriguez also emerging as a World Cup candidate, prior to his hopes being dashed by a knee injury against Manchester City two months ago.

The former Burnley striker readily acknowledged his old sidekick’s input as a creator as well as taker of chances, saying: ‘It’s unbelievable playing alongside Rickie. We work well together, and I have learned so much from him. We complement each other’s game, and he has done a lot for me. He is much more than just a good finisher, and if you look at some of the goals I’ve scored for Southampton, you’ll see that.’

Link-up man: Lambert does an awful lot of work when coming deep and playing off his midfielders

Get hold of it! Carroll finds it difficult to keep hold of possession and often finds himself isolated up top

29 - Yaya Toure

28 - Daniel Sturridge

27 - Wayne Rooney

26 - Steven Gerrard

24 - Olivier Giroud

23 - RICKIE LAMBERT and Sergio Aguero

Of course, Lambert is no slouch at helping himself in the opposition area, as demonstrated by a record of 106 goals in 207 appearances for Southampton and a strike rate that puts Carroll’s in the shade.

It all points to Rodgers, who helped transform Daniel Sturridge into an automatic choice for England after plucking him from the fringes of Chelsea’s team, possibly pulling off another transfer market masterstroke, with his first signing of the summer. While some may struggle to picture Lambert trading back heels and one-touch flicks with Sturridge or Luis Suarez, Rodgers is convinced he will take it in his stride.

He can be even more certain that settling in off the pitch will be a formality. Born and raised in the Westvale area of Kirkby, Lambert’s parents Ray and Maureen still live there and were part of a four-car convoy that motored down to Wembley for his England debut against Scotland last August.

He has come a long way since asking non-League Marine for a trial after being released by Liverpool as a teenager. As he packs his bags for Brazil, he may just shake his head in wonder at how far.
