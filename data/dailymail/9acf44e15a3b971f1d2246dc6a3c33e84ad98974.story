Prince Harry has amazed helicopter instructors with his flying skills on his Apache training course in America.

The 27-year-old is on the intensive two-month programme which will pave the way for him to return to Afghanistan.

The rigorous course is reserved for the British Army's Air Corp's top flying talent and Harry has ‘surpassed all expectations, including his own’, senior sources told the Mail.

‘It is true to say that he is doing very, very well – although Harry would never claim to be the best the military has ever seen. That’s just not his style,’ they said.

The Apache helicopters are able to operate in
all weathers, day or night. They can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential
targets in a matter of seconds.

‘But the fact that he is even training as an Apache pilot is testament to his skills as they only skim off the best.

‘He is working very hard out in the U.S. and is proving to be a real natural.

‘It’s all rather unexpected and slightly serendipitous as the only 
reason Harry chose to train as a helicopter pilot was because his 
chances of being deployed on the frontline had hit a wall with the army.

‘Fortunately he has found a career he
absolutely loves and excels at. He is the most relaxed and happy in his
professional life than anyone has ever seen him. It’s great to see.

‘He certainly isn’t getting any special treatment in California, it’s not the way he wants it.

‘And he is absolutely loving being in
the States. The course is testing his full range of flying skills, 
everything he has learnt so far.’

Another source added: ‘Prince Harry has matured immensely in recent years. His career means everything to him.’

The Prince is learning to fly the £46million Apache gunship alongside 19 other servicemen at the Naval Air Facility in El Centro, California, where the hit film Top Gun was filmed.

The course focuses on honing aviation environmental skills and live firing and includes techniques such as ground skimming and night flying.

Lt Col Peter Bullen, the exercise 
director, promised that Harry would be treated in the same way as any 
other army captain when he flew out to the U.S. 10 days ago.

The training is carried out in California because the hot and dusty conditions are similar to Afghanistan.

Harry will move to Gila Bend in rural Arizona in the coming weeks to practice firing missiles and rockets.

Assuming he passes the course, the Royal will be one of a select number of pilots
to have expertise in the two-person helicopters of which 
Britain has a fleet of 67.

He will be categorised as Limited 
Combat Ready and will have at least four months of further training 
before he is available to return to the field as an Apache pilot.

It
has long been known the Prince is keen to return to combat after his 
first deployment in 2007 was cut short after ten weeks, much to his 
disappointment, because of security fears.

If
he is deployed next year his main tasks will be to provide air cover 
for ground troops and to seek and destroy Taliban positions.

The
Apaches are vital tools in the fight against the Taliban specifically 
designed to destroy tanks and can operate in all weathers, day or night.

They can detect, classify and prioritise up to 256 potential targets in a matter of seconds.

The aircraft carry a mix of weapons including rockets, Hellfire missiles and a 30mm chain gun.

While Prince Harry hones his flying skills, his former girlfriend Chelsy Davy was seen last night leaving a reception held at the Dorsia club in London hosted by luxury clothing brand Beulah London and the United Nations
