Thousands of A-level students who hoped to secure university places last year could have been given the wrong marks, a whistleblower has claimed.

Senior exam board supervisor David Leitch found that 10 per cent of pupils should have received a higher grade when he checked papers where schools had queried their results.

Another 10 per cent should have been given a lower grade because final scores were added up wrongly by examiners, Mr Leitch said.

The claims are the latest in a long line of controversies relating to Britain's chaotic exams system, which have raised grave concerns about standards.

Mr Leitch said that, following requests from schools in August 2011 for re-marking, he and his team spotted basic clerical errors in 100 papers.

This led them to carry out extended checks on other papers marked by the same examiners and found a further 200 errors.

Mr Leitch said he emailed 30 schools to alert them to the problem affecting A-Level and GCSE papers after he was dissatisfied with a review ordered by the exam watchdog Ofqual.

He has been suspended by exam board OCR.

Mr Leitch claimed that, when he spotted the mistakes, he was told by OCR to stop the checks.

'We were amazed, he told Channel 4 News. 'We wanted the candidates to receive the correct results and if these checks were not brought to light they wouldn't get the correct results.'

'It's so bizarre, it should be of paramount significance to all of us who work within an awarding body that we issue correct results to our candidates.

'It's the number one priority that we have. To tell people that have uncovered mistakes that you must discontinue these checks is outrageous.'

OCR say their assessors checked the scripts of over 1,100 examiners and in only a few cases did this affect the overall grade that had been awarded.

But that view is disputed by Mr Leitch, who claims that he has uncovered an additional 50 to 100 papers with marking errors in the last few weeks.

He said: 'We checked 50,000 scripts and found 700 errors.

'I believe there would have been thousands. Not thousands of incorrect grades, but thousands of incorrect results issued.'

A spokesman for OCR said: 'OCR's top priority at this time is to reassure those taking exams now that our systems have been significantly improved.'

The exam board has introduced new stages into the checking of manually marked scripts, which it says 'will ensure a high level of clerical accuracy'.

It said it was processing the disputed exam papers and would make grade changes, if required.

The spokesman added: 'We confirm that a supervisor has been suspended pending investigation.

'To say anything more would prejudice the investigation.

'We support Ofqual's planned review of examination marking and will be glad to share any lessons learnt from last year's mistakes.'

An Ofqual spokesman said: 'Mr Leitch is now making two serious allegations about last summer's exam series: that OCR did not properly do the checks that it claimed to have done, and also that it misled the regulator.

'We need to establish as a matter of urgency whether these allegations are true.

'We have written to OCR seeking an urgent explanation.

'We would ask that Mr Leitch also shares all the documents he has with us.

'We will not comment further on this case until we have seen OCR's full response.

'If we find OCR has acted improperly we will take the matter further and if appropriate use our enforcement powers.'

In a statement, the Department of Education  said: 'The level of error here is simply unacceptable.

'We have been crystal clear that exam boards must produce papers that are error-free, and award the correct grades to students.

'It is exactly these kinds of issues that have led us to strengthen Ofqual's regulatory powers and introduce a new power to allow them to fine exam boards in the future.

'We are continuing to look at whether even stronger powers are needed.'

Mr Leitch's claims were revealed less than 48 hours after the head of the UK's largest exam board cast doubt over A-level and GCSE standards.

Rod Bristow, president of Pearson UK, which owns Edexcel, said that boards should be ‘worried’ about the pattern of ever improving results.

He stopped short of agreeing there had been grade inflation but admitted it was 'indisputable' that grades in A-levels and GCSEs had improved.

Exam board officials have previously defended standards, insisting that year-on-year grade improvements were due to students’ hard work.

A newspaper investigation last December revealed how seminars were giving teachers vital information about papers.

It also exposed one of the chief examiners at Edexcel boasting about how the board had managed to clear easy exams with Ofqual.

Steph Warren, a senior official at Edexcel, told an undercover reporter, posing as a geography teacher considering using the firm’s GCSE exams, that ‘you don’t have to teach a lot’.

Another Edexcel English official boasted about how, thanks to easy coursework, ‘weak kids’ could get through ‘on anything really’.

Ofqual later announced it was banning thousands of exam seminars, which posed ‘unacceptable risks’ to the integrity of the system.

Some teachers expected to receive ‘privileged information’ about exams, it claimed.
