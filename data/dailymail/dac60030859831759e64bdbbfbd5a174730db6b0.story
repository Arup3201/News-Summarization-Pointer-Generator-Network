Miss Philippines has been crowned Miss World in a glittering finale despite threats by Islamist groups to disrupt the competition.

Megan Young, who wore a glamorous pink fishtail dress, won the 63rd annual beauty pageant on Indonesia's resort island of Bali.

The final round was held amid tight security after ongoing protests by Muslim extremists - who had previously branded the iconic competition 'pornography' and a 'whore contest'.

Emotional: The 23-year-old smiled and held her hands to her face after being crowned winner of the 63rd annual beauty pageant on Indonesia's resort island of Bali

'I promise to be the best Miss World ever,' said the teary-eyed 23-year-old today after being crowned Miss World 2013.

She beat 127 contestants vying for the crown - all of whom took to the stage wearing a range of shimmering and sequined evening gowns.

Four candidates had dropped out earlier, mainly due to illnesses, according to organisers. 

As Ms Young's name was called out, a large number of Filipino fans celebrated by screaming, jumping and waving the country's flag.

The brunette beauty, who took the crown from last year's winner Wenxia Yu of China, was born in the United States.

She moved to the Philippines aged 10 - and has since appeared in films and as a television host.

Miss France Marine Lorphelin, 20, was crowned runner-up in the competition, while Miss Ghana Carranzar Naa Okailey Shooter, 22, came in third.

Miss England Kirsty Heslewood was ranked in the top 10 contestants in the competition.

Despite threats from the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) to disrupt the contest, police said no rallies were staged.

The
group has demonstrated for weeks, calling for the government to cancel 
the pageant, which it claims shows too much skin and goes against 
Islamic teachings.

Miss World organisers had earlier 
agreed to cut bikinis from the swimsuit competition - replacing them with
more conservative sarongs.

But pressure continued to mount - with more 
mainstream groups joining in and calling for the show to be banned.

Indonesia's government announced three 
weeks ago that the final would be moved from the outskirts of the 
capital Jakarta to Hindu-dominated Bali, where extremist influence is minimal.

However, Haidar Al-Hamid, head of the East Java province branch of the FPI, had previously claimed that the group planned to travel to Bali today to disrupt the contest.

The British, 
Australian and US embassies issued warnings to citizens planning trips 
to the resort island during the competition, saying there could be large-scale 
protests or even attacks.

Umar Faroq, the director of vital security for Bali provincial police, said thousands of security forces had been deployed to secure the final.

'The success in securing the Miss World final will be a benchmark for the police in securing the incoming APEC Summit', he said, referring to the upcoming Asia-Pacific Cooperation summit on Bali, which will be attended by world leaders, including President Barack Obama, and thousands of delegates.
