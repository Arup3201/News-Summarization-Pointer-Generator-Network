Martin O'Neill says he completely understands Roy Keane's decision to step down as Aston Villa assistant manager but is delighted he has further pledged his commitment to his role with the Republic of Ireland.

Keane, who is O'Neill's No 2 at Ireland, decided to step down to concentrate more on his international duties.

The former Sunderland and Ipswich manager had been involved in training on Thursday and only informed Villa manager Paul Lambert of his decision on Friday morning.

After a supremely successful playing career with Nottingham Forest, Manchester United and Celtic, Keane has had a turbulent time as a manager:

August 2006: Takes over as Sunderland manager

May 2007: Sunderland promoted to Premier League, Keane named 'Championship manager of the year'

2007-08: Keeps Sunderland in the Premier League, finishing 15th

December 2008: Resigns as Sunderland boss following disputes with Ellis Short and Niall Quinn

April 2009: Appointed Ipswich Town manager. Finishes 15th in Championship in first full season.

January 2011: Sacked by Ipswich with the club 21st in the Championship.

November 2013: Joins Republic of Ireland management team as assistant to Martin O'Neill 

July 2014: Becomes Aston Villa assistant manager, alongside work with Ireland 

November 2014: Quits as Villa No 2 

O'Neill says he understands why Keane has stepped down from his role at the Premier League side, but has never had any issues with his commitment with him at Ireland so far.

He told FAI TV : 'We had a brief discussion at the last international get together and I think Roy was more concerned about having that full commitment to the Aston Villa club job and ourselves.

'I never had a problem about his commitment to the Republic of Ireland though and I'm sure Paul (Lambert) didn't at Villa either.

'Everything I have expected him to bring to the table so far he has done - his commitment, enthusiasm and the strong desire that we know he possesses.

'Eventually those kind of things catch up with you either before or after Christmas though.

'Roy, being the perfectionist he is, wants to give everything to every single cause, and he was worried about this commitment issue of carrying both roles.'

In a statement Keane explained his reasons for stepping down saying: 

'Ultimately, my roles with Villa and Ireland and combining my commitment to these have become too much.

'It isn't fair to either Villa or Ireland, so I've made this decision.

'I'd like to thank Paul for giving me a great opportunity to come to a brilliant football club, I've really enjoyed my experiences at Villa and I wish the management team, the players, the supporters and the club nothing but the best going forward.'

Villa manager Lambert praised Keane's impact at the club, and said he totally respected the decision.

'Roy came to me this morning and he informed me that, ultimately, the difficulty of combining both roles has prompted his decision, which I respect totally.

'In the brief period we have worked together he has been great in the role and I understand his reasons for leaving.' 

The club thanked Keane for his contribution over the past six months, and said they were now focused on finding his replacement. 

Aston Villa won three of their first four league games with Keane at the club, but haven't won any since
