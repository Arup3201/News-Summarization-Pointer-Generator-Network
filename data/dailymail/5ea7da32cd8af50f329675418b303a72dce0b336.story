Carl Froch set his sights on a title fight in the boxing capital of Las Vegas after defending his IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles by beating George Groves for a second time in front of 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night.

The win brings to an end months of wrangling between the pair since Froch controversially beat Groves in the first fight between the two in November.

Froch said: 'I am unbelievably elated, this is the best moment of my career. I have been involved in some magnificent fights with some top, top world champions and this is by far the biggest and best crowd I have boxed in front of and the biggest event I have been involved in.

Hitman: Carl Froch celebrates after his victory over George Groves at Wembley Stadium

'I am very proud and George 
should be very proud. I have been in with some of the best fighters in 
the world and let's be honest it was neck and neck.

'It was a stand off and sometimes in professional boxing it only takes one punch and 
unfortunately for George he was on the end of a heavy right hand.

'I showed tonight why I'm a four-time champion of the world, why I've defended my world title 13 times on the spin.

'I am amongst the best fighters in the world - that's who George Groves was in there with tonight.

'The finish of that (fight) showed why I've mixed with the elite for many years and how hard it is to get to that level.'

Brutal: Carl Froch knocked out George Groves with a devastating right hand

Groves taunted Froch in the build-up to the fight and predicted he would knock his opponent out with a left hook.

The 26-year-old, however, was magnanimous in defeat while pledging to return 'bigger, better and stronger'.

He
 said: 'It's boxing, fair play to Carl, he caught me. I felt I was 
boxing well, but he caught me well I've got to hold my hands up.

'I'll come back stronger. Ultimately, I felt I let myself down, I wish him all the best.

'I think I was ahead on the scorecards, I'll be pushing hard to get my world title shot. I made a mistake, but I will come back.'

Love match: Carl Froch goes down on one knee to his girlfriend Rachael Cordingley

Froch had put his career on line to take on Groves and now the 36-year-old Nottingham Cobra is ready to fight on.

He
 said: 'I would love to box in Las Vegas, it is the fight capital of the
 world, and that's one thing I haven't done. I will never top Wembley 
Stadium, in front of 80,000 and to put boxing on this platform is very 
special.

'This evening will never be topped but I would like to fight in Las Vegas, opponent who knows. I'll leave that to Rob McCracken. He has guided my career from day one and I do what he says. When I listen to him, it always works.'

Froch went down on one knee in the ring but there was some confusion over whether he had proposed to girlfriend Rachael Cordingley.

He said: 'I told her how much I love, I didn’t actually officially
propose to her. I was going to but I couldn’t sort out the ring but I will
marry her one day. This is a special moment in my life and the next special one will be marrying Rachael.'

Groves also insists there is no bad blood between him and Froch, adding: 'It's boxing, the fights are hyped, I honestly feel no way about any of my opponents.

'I don't like them or dislike them, it's the easiest way for me to go about my business.'
