Oversleeping or being late for the bus are both excuses that teachers across the world have to put up with from pupils who are late.

But one primary school pupil in Chongqing, south west China had somewhat different reason last week for being delayed.

This boy became stuck when he tried to squeeze his body through a 10cm gap between a wall and a cement column.

Jammed: The boy's head became tightly wedged between a wall and a column

Support: Fire fighters were able to reach the boy from both sides as they attempted to free him

After wriggling his way in, the top of his forehead and the back of his head became tightly wedged between the masonry.

Once
his teachers realised what had happened to the playful schoolboy they 
rushed to help, trying to release him from the tight gap.

But they could not make any progress 
and were forced to call the fire brigade on Tuesday in a bit to extract 
the boy his unusual tight spot.

The
emergency service personnel tried to drag the jammed in boy from his 
concrete confines, but had to give up after becoming afraid they would 
hurt him.

Even small movements made the boy scream in pain, so they had to give up and come up with a new solution.

Eventually electric saws were used to cut away masonry so the boy's head could be freed.

Afterwards cream had to be applied to the distressed child's head where it had rubbed against the concrete.

There there: Cream is applied to the scrapped forehead of a Chinese boy after he was freed from between a pillar and a wall
