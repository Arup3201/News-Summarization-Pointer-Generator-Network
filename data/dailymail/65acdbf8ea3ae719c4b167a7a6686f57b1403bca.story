With its elegant frescoes, delicate sweeps of cerise and violet bougainvillea and vast beds covered in pristine white linen, Palazzo Margherita is a palace fit for Hollywood royalty.

But this is a far cry from your average star-studded holiday spot. Instead, the pretty 19th century palazzo is owned and run by one of modern cinema's greats - director Francis Ford Coppola.

Nestled in the heart of the sleepy Basilicata town of Bernalda, where Coppola’s grandfather Agostino Coppola was born, the villa boasts nine luxurious suites, each of which is decorated with handpainted frescoes.

And relax: The delicate frescoes and comfortable bed belonging to the 'Sofia' suite - a room inspired by Coppola's director daughter, Sofia

Chic: The palatial ensuite bathroom attached to the Sofia suite includes delicate patterned tiles, a standalone bath and toiletries by Italian brand Santa Maria Novella

The result of a collaboration between Coppola and French interior designer, Jacques Grange, other highlights include the flower-filled gardens, a chic tiled pool and a restaurant serving up locally sourced organic fare.

First built in 1892,
palazzo was painstakingly restored by Coppola and Grange in 2004, and includes a wealth of personal motifs - among them the Tunisian elements that reference Coppola's grandmother, Maria Zasa, in Suite Nine.

Elsewhere, features include restored marble floors, handpainted frescoes on every ceiling and palatial bedrooms, each with an ensuite bathroom and balcony overlooking the little town.

The interior gardens feature lush, 
semi-tropical plants, a magnificent fountain and a private swimming 
pool. If that all feels like too much, the hotel offers guests spa treatments in their rooms, while in the evenings, the salon becomes a private cinema showing one of 300 Italian classic films, personally chosen by Coppola himself.

Luxurious: Suite Nine, or, as it's also known, the Francis Suite, was inspired by the director's Tunisian grandmother and is the most expensive room

Relaxed: Suites are crammed with fresh flowers and boast TV's made by Spanish luxury goods giant, Loewe while staff are on call 24 hours a day

Roman
 holiday: Suite Seven was inspired by Coppola's son Roman who is also a 
director and was nominated for an Oscar for his film Moonrise Kingdom in
 2012

Curated: The huge salon is transformed into a cinema when night falls, with guests offered a choice of 300 classic Italian films each chosen by Coppola himself

Unfortunately for those who want to become guests of the legendary director, a stay at Palazzo Margherita doesn't come cheap. A night in the hotel's most lavish suite costs up to £1,500 a night, while those wanting to stay in the cheapest accommodation, the Garden Room, will still have to find £460 to fund it.

For those who can, the surrounding countryside with its tiny towns, rustic villages and vine-laden fields will help soften the blow when the bill arrives, while nearby Grottaglie is famous for its ceramic pots.

If you've got the cash to spare, you can even follow in the Duke of Cambridge's footsteps and have some shirts whipped up for you by tailor Angelo Inglese at his Ginosa atelier.

Speaking about his decision to open up Palazzo Margherita, Coppola said: 'I never initially dreamed of opening a 
resort in Italy, let alone in the town of my grandfather Agostino 
Coppola.

'Yet when I purchased and designed 
the now Palazzo Margherita for friends and family to call home in Italy,
 I knew I needed to extend the property and surrounding village of "Bernalda bella" to my guests as well.'

Party time: Bar Cinecittà opens onto the plaza and serves up traditional Italian treats, while the wood-panelled Family Bar is where aperitifs are served

Magnificent: A fountain dominates the private gardens at the Palazzo Margherita, which also include a pool for guests to use

Glorious: The bougainvillea covered pool area (left) and the courtyard which is home to a selection of wicker chairs and tables that guests can use for supper

Stunning:
 Guests can take their meals in the wisteria fringed courtyard as well 
as enjoy a stroll in the landscaped private gardens beyond

Tropical: The private gardens at Palazzo Margherita are packed with tropical flora such as palm trees. Right, the palatial 19th century facade
