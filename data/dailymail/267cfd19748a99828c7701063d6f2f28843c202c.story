A man who launched a foul mouthed and racist rant at a fellow passenger on a London to Brighton train, is being investigated by police.

Clutching a beer bottle, and dressed in a high visibility work jacket, the man can be seen on mobile phone footage uploaded online calling his fellow commuter a 'mongrel', 'monkey' and a 'gorilla', as he threatens to 'take his eye out'.

YouTube footage uploaded on May 26 shows other passengers, including a young woman, attempting to intervene and telling the man - who appears to be heavily intoxicated - to sit down and be quiet.

Speaking with a strong Irish accent the man complains that he was 'rudely awoken' by the other passenger.

But according to comments made by others on the train, it seems he had in fact fallen asleep on his fellow passenger.

He said: 'I don't like being rudely awaken by some mongrel.'

He then goes on to call the man a 'gorilla', 'godzilla' and a 'monkey' before telling him he will 'take his eyes out' as he waves his beer bottle. 

The rant lasts almost three minutes, concluding with the man insisting he is 'not racist', while his alleged victim remains quiet and calm throughout.

British Transport Police (BTP) has appealed for witnesses to the incident which occurred on a train near Brighton on May 26.

A spokesman said: 'Everyone has the right to travel without fear of abuse or threatening behaviour and BTP takes this type of offence extremely seriously', The Telegraph reports.

While the man was cautioned for fare evasion, it is believed the alleged victim did not want to take any further action. 

In the clip, the man wears tracksuit bottoms, trainers and a hi-visibility jacket with NTL on the back.

Virgin Media, formerly NTL, said the name had not existed since the relaunch in 2007 and that it did not believe the man was connected with the company.

But a spokesman added: 'If he is identified from amongst our thousands of excellent employees, we'll take the strongest possible action as we completely condemn the views expressed in the video.'
