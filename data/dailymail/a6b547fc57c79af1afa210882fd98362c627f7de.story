For Gregoire Alessandrini, the diner is a symbol of American nostalgia as wholesome as the apple pie that was served inside.

So a recent trip back to New York - 25 years on from when he first lived there as a film student - inspired the photographer to share his old images of the relics, for Big Apple ‘nostalgics’ like him as well as the younger generations of New Yorkers curious about their past.

‘As a pure bred Parisian, New York City had always seemed an obvious destination for me,’ he told MailOnline.

The Lost Diners: photographer Gregoire Alessandrini wanted to share his 1990s photographs of the famous American restaurants to highlight the changing face of New York

Cheyenne: When pushing the door of the Cheyenne diner, he said, you felt like you were part of the legend of the city, just for the price of a burger with fries!

Bygone era: I think they were also a type of restaurants which was accessible to everybody, from any social backgrounds, said Mr Allesandrini

‘A place I felt I already knew through a personal exploration of American movies, rock vinyls, art and photography books.

‘I finally had the chance to go to New York to become a film student and I started exploring the city from one end to another… always carrying my old Nikons with me.’

He explained that while the city had obviously changed tremendously since the 1970s and 1980s, ‘you just had to walk around the corner and enter any downtown dive bar to find the signs and remains of this legendary New York’.

Keeping up with the Jones's: The Jones diner was amazing because of its location,' he said. 'An old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown Manhattan. What a contrast!

Fusion: This old diner was converted into a Chinese and Spanish restaurant, a combination of food that doesn't usually go together

Mr Alessandrini focused on diners in particular as he saw them as a real part of American mythology and imagery.

‘You see them in classic films and the ones that were left in New York were really great looking. Their names were wonderful, some kind of urban poetry – The Moondance, The Lost Diner – and it seemed to me they were a real part of the old New York.

His favorites include the Lost Diner ‘for its name’: ‘It was really lost on the edge of Manhattan and its name reminded me of Lost Highway by David Lynch!’

Dancing in the Moonlight: Among his favorites was the Moondance Diner, saying that its loss is a 'real pity'

The Moondance, says Mr Alessandrini, had a particular allure for its turning moon crescent on the roof

Mr Alessandrini said he realized that many sites documented the disappearing New York neighborhoods and landmarks, with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores

He also had a soft spot for The Moondance and The Jones.

‘It seemed to be a real part of Soho and of the West Broadway area at the time and its loss is a real pity. It looked really great from the outside with its turning moon crescent on the roof.

‘The Jones diner was amazing because of its location. An old greasy spoon joint in the middle of hip downtown Manhattan. What a contrast !’

After spending eight years in the city, he returned home to Paris, but had a chance to return to New York last September, where he witnessed how fast the city was changing. This rapid change led to him posting his old images on his website galessandrini.blogspot.fr.

‘This sudden transformation of downtown Manhattan had started before the Twin Towers went down but it seems to have accelerated at an incredible pace.

At the drive-thru: For Mr Alessandrini, he felt he already knew New York through his exploration of movies, vinyls and art

End of the empire: The diners were mainly replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings which seem to lack personality and the classic architecture

He believes that current restaurants in New York are now either very high-end or boring food chains all looking the same

‘Surfing on the web, I realized that this transformation of the city is a widely discussed topic, with many internet sites documenting the disappearing New York neighborhoods and landmarks, with documentary films being released and neighborhood associations fighting the chain stores and the real estate development in Manhattan.

‘More reasons for me to keep scanning my old negatives and color slides kept in an old suitcase for almost 20 years!’

Most of the diners have now gone, a fact Mr Alessandrini laments.

'New York will always be New York and I see young people discovering Manhattan and being as fascinated by it as I was 25 years ago. Yet I really have the feeling that something was lost somewhere. Something of the city's soul is definitely gone.

'The diners were definitely a part of that New York. They were also a type of restaurant which was accessible to everybody, from any social background.

'When pushing the door of the Cheyenne diner, you felt like you were part of the legend of the city, just for the price of a burger with fries!'

Now the diners have mainly been replaced by glass towers and luxury buildings lacking in personality, he argues, with architecture that 'will never become as "classic" and iconic as the diners were.'

'The recent evolution of restaurants in Manhattan seems to be a good representation of the global evolution of Manhattan as Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg wanted it to be. They are either very high-end or boring food chains that all look the same.
