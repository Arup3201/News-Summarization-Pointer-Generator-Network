Tesco scam: Jenna Bowen, 21, 'panicked' when she started receiving letters from baliffs saying she owed money

A Tesco supermarket manager who pocketed £7,000 by fiddling the National Lottery at her store has walked free from court.

Jenna Bowen, 21, altered the amount of money paid out to lottery winners so she could take home money from the store in Pembroke Dock, West Wales.

Her scam, which she used to pay off her debts, seemed to go undetected until the supermarket giant's bosses noticed they were losing money on the lottery.

But, Bowen, who had worked for the supermarket giant since she was 16 years old, was only given community service and a suspended prison sentence when she appeared at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court in Pembrokeshire.

Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said: 'Bowen was an acting manager which gave her access to an office where lottery slips were kept.

'The slips showed how much money had been paid out on winning tickets each day.

'Bowen altered the figures to make it look as if the machine had paid out more than it actually had - then pocketed the difference.'

Tesco called in police after Bowen admitted the theft at a disciplinary hearing, where she was subsequently sacked.

During an interview, Bowen told police she 'panicked' after receiving letters from bailiffs relating to unpaid bills and a loan from when she was living with a former partner.

James Subbiani, defending, said: 'To a greater or lesser degree she has ruined her life - good employment in the future will be difficult to achieve.'

Store: Bowen went through with her secret scam in Pembroke Dock, West Wales

Bowen, of Pembroke Dock, admitted nine charges of theft and was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for two years.

She
 was also ordered to complete 200 hours unpaid work, and pay £6996 
compensation, £80 towards prosecution costs and an £85 victim surcharge.

The chair of the magistrates’ bench said: 'We could have imposed custodial sentence but we are suspending that today.'

Caught: Bowen was forced to face a disciplinary hearing after supermarket bosses noticed they were losing money on the lottery

Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court heard Bowen was able to take the money by altering slips printed out from the store’s National Lottery machine.

The slips showed how much money had been paid out on winning tickets each day.

Bowen altered the figures to make it look as if the machine had paid out more than it actually had.

This means customers were still able to take home their winnings, but Bowen pocketed the additional value.

Amounts ranging from £415 to £997.90 were taken from the branch’s cash office.
