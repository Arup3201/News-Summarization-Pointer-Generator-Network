It was a fitting tribute to salute their fallen colleagues, as 343 flags were carried by an honour guard for each one of the firemen who died on 9/11.

Firemen from across the U.S. gathered in Manhattan, New York, around St Patrick's Cathedral, as a memorial service was held after an honour guard had marched down Fifth Avenue.

The largest fire department in the U.S. held the ceremony as part of a weekend of events commemorating the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks that devastated America in 2001.

‘If it had happened in our city, we would have run into that building too. And they would have been here for us now.’

Patrick Lyons, 9, tragically lost his father Lieutenant Patrick Lyons, of Squad 252 in Brooklyn, New York, in the attacks just 26 days before he was born, reported NBC.

‘Dear dad - I just missed meeting you,’ he bravely said during the service. ‘I want you to know that mummy is doing a great job of raising me.’

‘I know you are in heaven and always watching over me,' he added. I love knowing you are a hero. I wish I could have met you.’

Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano echoed President Barack Obama’s earlier comments that the country and its people are stronger because of the attacks.

‘The world may have called them brave, but we just call it doing our jobs,’ Commissioner Cassano said. ‘They died doing what they joined the fire department to do - helping others.’

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
also praised the FDNY, reported NBC. ‘In the FDNY, our city is lucky to 
have a group of men and women who can overcome natural fear to serve 
others,’ he said.

Among the tributes relating to the number 343, an antique fire engine with ‘engine company 343’ on its side was parked in front of the cathedral.

‘We knew it was bad,’ Brooklyn battalion chief John Murphy, 50, told NBC, of watching the buildings collapse on television. ‘We didn't know the numbers, but we knew a lot of people just died.’

Meanwhile, at a ceremony on Saturday in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, George W. Bush praised the 40 passengers and crew who fought back against their Flight 93 hijackers on 9/11 for carrying out what he described as one of the most courageous acts in U.S. history.

Americans are coming together on Sunday where the World Trade Center soared in Manhattan, New York, and in Washington D.C. where the Pentagon now stands as a fortress once breached.

America will fall silent at 8.46am EDT today as the nation unites to mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

President Barack Obama will lead the country in remembrance, visiting all three sites where terrorist hijackers carried out their murderous acts, before delivering remarks at a commemorative event in Washington.

There were 2,753 victims of  the 2001 atrocity when terrorists slammed passenger jets into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in the nation's capital.

A fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers stormed the cockpit in a desperate effort to prevent hijackers hitting a fourth target, Washington's US Capitol.

Thoughtful: Firefighters from all over the country came to hear the memorial service at St Patrick's for the 2,753 people who died in the terrorist attacks

Tearful: A guest at the service becomes emotional as she listens to Ashley Fodor, the daughter of firefighter Edward Kilduff who was killed on September 11

In New York, a commemoration ceremony will be held at the National September 11 Memorial located in the World Trade Centre site.

Moments of silence will be observed to coincide with the exact times that the hijacked planes hit starting at 8.46am local time (1.46pm BST).

Additional periods of reflection will take place at 9.59am (2.59pm BST) and 10.28am (3.28pm BST) to mark the moments that the two towers at the World Trade Centre fell.

During the ceremony, the names of those who died in the attack will be read, while bells are tolled across the city.

Street tribute: Tea lights litter the pavement on Manhattan's 59th Street in New York beside the memorial to the victims who are pictured on a gallery

Among those present during the solemn ceremony are expected to be relatives of some of the 67 British victims of the attack.

A separate event will take place later at the British Memorial Garden in New York's Hanover Square.
