The dollar has nearly hit an eight-month low and stocks dropped this morning as the government shutdown enters into its second week with no end in sight.

Politicians on both sides of the aisle have not shown any indication that they will be willing to compromise in order to call off the shutdown and approve the debt-ceiling increase.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday not to raise the U.S. debt ceiling without a 'serious conversation' about what is driving the debt, while Democrats said it was irresponsible and reckless to raise the possibility of a U.S. default.

Erratic: Since the shutdown on Monday evening, the S&P has gone through troubling hurdles that will only get worse should the government get closer to defaulting on our debt

The United States faces a deadline of October 17 to raise its $16.7trillion debt limit or risk an unprecedented debt default.

The two issues of emergency funding for the government to operate and increase the U.S. borrowing authority started out separately in the House but have been merged by the pressure of time.

The dollar fell, hovering near an eight-month low against a basket of major trading currencies, and crude oil prices slipped as the government shutdown and looming fight over the debt ceiling clouded the economic outlook.

'Last week investors were hopeful that the government shutdown would be short-lived in nature,' said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.

'Now that it's entering its second week, investors are growing a bit more edgy and that's being played out in weaker world stocks and the dollar staying on the defensive.'

Bleak: Chinese officials spoke out as their country holds the majority of U.S. Treasury bonds, warning the U.S. should not make another mistake like the one that led to the S&P downgrade

The S&P 500 .SPX has fallen for two straight weeks and is down nearly 3 per cent from its all-time high of 1,725.52 on concerns about the effect of Washington dysfunction on the economy.

The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 149.44 points which is 0.99 percent and the NasdaqÂ  dropped 30.381 points or 0.8 per cent.

Equities investors were unnerved by the apparent hardening of stances over the weekend. U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Monday and European shares fell to a four-month low.

In comments on Sunday television political talk shows, neither Republicans nor Democrats offered any sign of impending agreement on either the shutdown or the debt ceiling, and both blamed the other side for the impasse.

'I'm willing to sit down and have a conversation with the president,' said Boehner, speaking on ABC's 'This Week.' But, he added, President Barack Obama's 'refusal to negotiate is putting our country at risk.'

On CNN's 'State of the Union' program, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said: 'Congress is playing with fire,' adding that Obama would not negotiate until 'Congress does its job' by reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling.

China, the biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries, urged Washington to take decisive steps to avoid a crisis and ensure the safety of Chinese investments.

'The United States is totally clear about China's concerns about the fiscal cliff,' Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in the Chinese government's first public comment on the October 17 deadline.

'We hope the United States fully understands the lessons of history,' Zhu told reporters in Beijing, referring to the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's in 2011.

China held $1.277 trillion of U.S. Treasuries as of last July, according to U.S. Treasury data released month.

'Who should be worrying most of a possible U.S. default?' asked Deutsche Bank analysts. 'Looking at the top holders of U.S. Treasuries, recipients of U.S. social security should be most concerned, followed by the Fed and then China.'

Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, whose constituency includes Wall Street and New York's financial hub, said Boehner would be forced to act as the deadline for the nation's debt ceiling gets closer, calling it 'too dangerous' to not raise the U.S. debt limit and saying any default could lead to an economic 'recession, depression or worse.'

'The economy could collapse. Will it? No one's certain, but there's a high enough chance that no one - no one - should risk it,' Schumer told CNN's 'New Day.'
