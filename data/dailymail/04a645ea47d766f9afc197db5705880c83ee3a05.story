Fearless: Celebrity chef Annabel Karmel has a spine of steel and the coolest of heads in a crisis

Annabel Karmel, celebrity chef, author and businesswoman, doesn’t look like the sort of person you’d immediately turn to for help if you found yourself in a tight corner.

She is 51, petite — a little over 5ft tall — fine-boned and glamorous, her blonde hair cascading in a tumble of luxuriant curls.

She’s a doll-like size six, wears a floral pinny and pads round her elegant £20 million town house in North London in bare feet, her dainty toenails painted vermillion.

She looks as if a gust of wind would blow her over. But appearances are deceptive: Annabel has a spine of steel, the tenacity of a terrier and the coolest of heads in a crisis.

Last summer, she was robbed by a gang of muggers. They pounced after she parked her car in a quiet side street to go shopping, held her in an arm-lock and wrenched her £12,000 Rolex watch from her wrist, then snatched her shopping bag from the boot of her car.

While such an ordeal would have reduced most of us to quivering wrecks, Annabel, a divorced mum-of-three, had the presence of mind to note the registration number of one of the gang’s getaway mopeds.

She handed it to the police at the crime scene. The thugs, who had by then terrorised and robbed a string of affluent victims in the wealthy Hampstead area of north London — including a 70-year-old man who they hit with a hammer — were swiftly identified.

Within a couple of weeks they were arrested and charged. Their violent three-month crime spree abruptly curtailed, the trio — Corrie Moroney, 23, Alan Fitzgerald, 20 and Ellis Parkinson, 21 — were this week jailed for a total of 23 years.

Does Annabel now live in fear? ‘You can’t!’ she exclaims. ‘Otherwise, the muggers have won. They’ve got away with it. I won’t become a prisoner in my own home because of them.

‘I won’t pretend I’m not wary. I don’t wear an expensive watch any more. And I make sure I’ve got my house keys in my hand before I get out of my car as thieves often strike when people are standing on their own doorsteps.

‘I don’t take unnecessary risks. But I’m resilient. And, actually, I feel rather lucky. They could have hit me with the hammer.’

But the fact is, Annabel seems to be rather more unlucky than most: two years ago, she was forced to track down her beloved Samoyed, Hamilton, when he was dognapped by a gang.

She says: ‘I plastered posters, offering a reward for his safe return, all over London. So when a woman rang — she said she’d seen my poster, and although she was cagey and vague, she said she might be able to help — I went off on my own to meet her.

‘I suppose it seems reckless, but I was prepared to take a risk to get him back.

‘She lived on a council estate in north London. It was the sort of place you wouldn’t want to be alone in after dark, but I don’t remember feeling trepidation. I just wanted my dog back.

‘I knocked on the door, went into the flat and there was Hamilton, filthy and almost unrecognisable. There was a split second’s delay before he leapt into my arms. We’d been apart for ten days and he was mad with joy.’

The woman who was harbouring Annabel’s beloved dog claimed, improbably, he had been ‘dumped’ on her doorstep. Police, it later emerged, found she had links with an armed robber, a member of the gang they believed was responsible for snatching him, along with 11 other pedigrees, all ransomed for ‘reward’ money.

There was insufficient evidence to charge them; even so, Annabel felt she had won a small victory.

With the muggers, however, the evidence she provided was enough to convict them.

It happened on June 30 last year when she was nearing home. ‘It was a warm day, 5pm and broad daylight, and I wasn’t wearing anything ostentatious,’ says Annabel.

‘I parked my Mercedes in a side street to do some shopping — no one was around — and went to the boot to get a bag out. Just then, three men on mopeds sped up out of nowhere. One had a hammer and their faces were obscured by helmets and scarves. There was no time to feel scared.

‘They cornered me. I couldn’t run. One of them shouted: “Give us the watch,” but I couldn’t give it to them. I just froze. They’d pinioned me by my arms, wrenched the watch off, making my wrist bleed.

‘Then they took my striped canvas bag from the boot. I told them it was empty, but I think they thought my purse was in it.

‘Then I heard raised voices from people across the road: “Leave her alone!” For a second, the gang loitered and it was then that I took down the number plate. Then they sped off and it was over.

‘All I felt was relief: that I wasn’t hurt and all they’d taken were things which were replaceable.’

The police, summoned by passers-by, arrived within five minutes. ‘They tracked the gang in a helicopter and just over an hour later came back to me with a photo of my canvas bag under the seat of one of the mopeds. I was amazed how quick they were.’

The bag and registration number Annabel took were vital evidence that helped persuade the gang to plead guilty to 12 robberies at Blackfriars Crown Court this week.

Annabel, who chose not to attend court, feels their sentences — 11 years for ringleader Moroney, eight for Parkinson and four for accomplice Fitzgerald — were just.

She’s been told one of the men has since expressed his repentance in a letter that will be sent to her soon. ‘I’d like to read it,’ she says. ‘I’d even like to visit him in prison. I think I could tell then if his remorse was genuine. Can he really be sorry if he’s mugged 12 people? I’m curious to know.’

Successful: Annabel's business is worth £10million

Annabel’s no-nonsense attitude has been shaped by her upbringing and by life’s events. Born in 1962, she was raised by prosperous parents in Marble Arch, central London, attending the prestigious St Paul’s School for Girls.

Her father, Gordon, owned a manufacturing business, making shoe soles. But the family’s prosperity ended when the business failed.

Annabel’s mother, Evelyn, an architect, assumed the role of bread-winner, instilling in her daughter the values of self-sufficiency and hard work.

But her first career as a harpist — she trained at the Royal College of Music — ended after a terrible family tragedy. In 1985, Annabel married oil broker Simon Karmel and two years later a daughter, Natasha, arrived. Just 13 weeks later, she died of encephalitis.

It is the defining tragedy of Annabel’s life and the reason she gives short shrift to muggers and dognappers. Nothing could hurt her more than that loss.

‘Natasha’s hands were twitching involuntarily,’ she remembers of that dreadful day the illness first took hold.

‘She was projectile vomiting. I called the doctor who was quite dismissive. I felt embarrassed that I was being an over-protective first-time mum.

‘But the next morning Natasha was no better. I took her to hospital. She had a scan. I held her in my arms for four-and-a-half hours, and then she died. That is the most devastating loss a mother can bear.

‘I stopped playing the harp. Music seemed superficial. I re-evaluated my life. I knew the only way to deal with the grief was to have another child.’

Three more children followed — Nicholas, 26, Lara, 25 and Scarlett, 22 — and Annabel built a career round her family. She began to cook for her children and published a book of recipes to great acclaim. More books followed, and today her business is worth £10million.

‘Cooking became my therapy, my route through grief,’ she explains. ‘The books, the cooking ... they will be my legacy, because what you do for others lives on. What you do for yourself dies with you.’

Eight years ago, she and Simon were divorced — they remain amicable — and now shares her home with her partner, Stephen Margolis, a former film producer.

Natasha’s death puts everything into perspective. When in June 2013 Annabel sacked an employee, Mark Salter (then her sales director), his retaliation was vicious: he accused her of sexually harassing him.

She spent £60,000 on legal fees, fighting to clear her name. Last summer she was vindicated — on the morning the case was due in court, Salter, 39, retracted his allegation.

‘I wouldn’t be bullied,’ she says. ‘I stood up for what was right and I put up a good fight.’

No doubt, those three muggers now languishing in jail would wholeheartedly agree. 

After building her business from scratch at the kitchen table, Annabel believes that having children doesn't mean a full stop at the end of your CV. 

She is now helping equip other mums with the confidence and power to start-up their own businesses with her new book, Mumpreneur.
