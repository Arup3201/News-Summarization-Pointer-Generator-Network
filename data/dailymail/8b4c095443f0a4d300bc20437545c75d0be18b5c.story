As the clock strikes twelve on New Years Eve, thousands who have gathered on the banks of the Thames to watch the annual fireworks over London will experience something quite different.

This year, the skyline will not only be filled with exploding colours, but peach snow, banana confetti and giant 'zesty orange' bubbles.

Food scientists Bompas & Parr have been roped in to create the world’s first multi-sensory fireworks display, set to make the South Bank smell as sweet as a strawberry field – and taste like one too.

World's first: Food scientists Bompas & Parr will release 'zesty orange' bubbles, peach snow and banana confetti over the spectators on London's South Bank at the annual fireworks display this year

Food scientist Sam Bompas said they wanted to try to make a multi-sensory firework display because 'nothing of the sort had been attempted before'

The idea is to create an experience which is for all senses, one which spectators can see, smell and taste, as the British capital welcomes 2014.

Jelly geniuses Bompas & Parr, who famously put a cake-inspired crazy golf course on the roof of Selfridges, have created special effects involving fruit flavours and fruit smells, to go along with the fireworks.

Sam Bompas, food scientist, said: ‘The concept of the world's multi-sensory firework display came from researching grand historic spectacles. We realised nothing of the sort had been attempted before and that it would be a genuine world first.

‘We're going to actually let people taste the fireworks. And they're fruity.  You will see red in the sky, and you'll smell strawberry.

'It's a massive responsibility.'

He added: 'There's going to be floating orange bubbles, and when you pop them you will get this really zesty Spanish orange flavour coming out, you will have peach snow coming from the sky and banana confetti that is edible.’

As London’s South Bank has a limited 
space, partners Vodafone will be inviting people all over the world to 
enjoy an augmented reality experience synchronised with the display.

The
 first-ever London New Year’s Eve fireworks app, available 24 hours 
before New Year, will come alive for the first time when the New Year, 
2014, begins at midnight, adding to the experience of watching the 
fireworks display on television.

The New Year display will include floating orange bubbles, peach snow and banana confetti

Mayor Boris Johnson, who is presenting
 the annual spectacle, said: ‘London has a reputation for creativity and
 innovation, seeing things differently and experimenting.

'London
 is after all a city of firsts and this new approach to our New Year's 
Eve celebrations will add to the magic on the night, whether experienced
 at home or in town.’
