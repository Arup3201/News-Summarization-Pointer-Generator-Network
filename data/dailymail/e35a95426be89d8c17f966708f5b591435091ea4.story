The fighter who calls himself ‘The Alien’ is human after all.

Two months shy of his 50th birthday, Bernard Hopkins was well beaten by Sergey Kovalev who later advised the ring legend to call a halt to his illustrious 26-year career.

Hopkins was knocked down in the first round and lost every subsequent session of this light-heavyweight unification clash.

Hopkins, nicknamed 'The Alien' made his typical entrance to the ring, but it may well have been his last

‘He had a good game plan, he was nice and rangy,’ said Hopkins. ‘He fought a great technical fight. He has patience and every time he got hit he did the right thing and stepped back.

‘He’s going to be around a long time and I’ve got respect for someone who wants to fight the best.

'I really don't want to say anything [about his future]. It's been 50-50 for the last nine years.'

Hopkins, 18 years his opponent’s senior, won his first world title when Kovalev was just 12.

By the time the Russian turned professional 14 years later, Hopkins had already ruled the middleweight division for a decade.

Prior to Saturday night, Hopkins had boxed 494 rounds, more than five times as many as Kovalev.

And Father Time finally caught up with the Philadelphia native who clung on during a torrid final round to avoid the first stoppage defeat of his career.

‘He was a really tough opponent,’ said Kovalev. He is very good at keeping the distance. I have a lot of respect for him but he needs to stop his career.

‘He needs to give opportunities to younger guys to be champions.

‘I wanted to show my fans that I can box; I tried to knock him out but he has great defence.’

More than 8,000 fans packed into the famed Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, just a four-minute drive from the venue for Hopkins’ first professional fight – a defeat – in 1988.

Since then, Hopkins has proved himself a master at picking the right opponent at the right time to become the sport's oldest-ever world champion.

That followed a four-year stint as the undisputed middleweight king and a decade-long reign as the holder of at least one of the multiple belts.

Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya, Antonio Tarver, Roy Jones Jnr and Kelly Pavlik were among those swept aside.

Our own Joe Calzaghe’s Las Vegas triumph over the Executioner-cum-Alien in 2008 looked more impressive with every subsequent win.

But on this occasion, Hopkins’ timing was out.

Kovalev, who grew up in poverty in north-east Russia, was one step too far.

Hopkins looked composed between rounds despite the fact he was being comprehensively beaten 

Towards the end, Hopkins looked resigned to defeat as he sat slumped on his stool inbetween rounds

Fifteen months ago, he destroyed Welshman Nathan Cleverly in four brutal rounds in Cardiff to win the WBO title.

It was a particularly sweet victory given the three years he spent at the beginning of his career fighting for free as he tried to make his way in America.

He will be paid handsomely for this victory which adds the IBF and WBA belts to his collection.

The tone was set from the first bell as Hopkins was backed up on the ropes. He took a right to the top of the head which, along with a slight slip, sent him to the canvas.

From then on, Kovalev controlled the contest, proving he is more than a knock-out artist. It wasn’t until the seventh round that Hopkins landed anything of significance but even that didn’t win him the session on the judges’ cards which read 120-107 twice and 120-106.

And the concluding three minutes were hard to watch.

Kovalev set about trying to finish off the elder statesman while the referee hovered, perhaps a little too keen to preserve Hopkins’ record of always hearing the final bell.

Thirty eight punches reigned in, more than in any round of any of Hopkins' previous 41 fights tracked by data analysts CompuBox.

But make it he did. Perhaps for the final, final time.
