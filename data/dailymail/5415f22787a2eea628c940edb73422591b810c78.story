Police were called to Manchester City's former training ground a staggering 31 times in five years.

Sportsmail can reveal that on one occasion, a call was made when youths were spotted lurking with a javelin on the other side of a fence behind where the Premier League champions train.

Other reports, made during the period of June 2009 to June 2014, included a man spotted urinating on a grass verge within the Carrington complex, an egg attack on reception and a group of Manchester United fans following the team bus back from a derby and hurling abuse.

An egg attack was also reported as well as a group of Man United fans following the Man City team bus

And on another occasion a man wanted by police was arrested when he was found up a tree watching City train.

According to a report obtained under Freedom of Information laws from Greater Manchester Police, the youths with 'a javelin-type instrument' were spotted 'mooning' CCTV cameras on May 3, 2012, days after City's 1-0 win over United put them on course for the title.

It is one of a catalogue of bizarre callouts to the former base of Manuel Pellegrini's men who moved to the ultra-secure £200m City Football Academy last year.

In February 2011 police were called when men in a 4 x 4 followed the team bus after the Manchester derby in which Wayne Rooney scored his late overhead kick to give United a 2-1 win.

They are reported to have driven into the complex 'causing annoyance and shouting abuse' and made their getaway before police arrived.

Later that year a security guard was assaulted while in August 2012 police were called after football boots were stolen.

In September 2012, police were called out to arrest the wanted man who presumably wanted to watch his heroes while on the run.

He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary.

On two occasions police were called when footballs were taken from the former training ground which is a stone's throw away from that of rivals United in the south of the city.

During the same time period, police received 13 calls to the United complex.

In September 2009 officers turned up when concerns were raised over the welfare of a man at the site while in January of the following year police were called when an anti-Glazer protest took place outside the training ground.

In 2012 the club's grounds staff were hit by the theft of tools and five lawnmowers while in 2013 a bag was stolen and police were called when security refused access to a solicitor who was trying to issue a court order to an unnamed player.

Last year officers turned out twice to deal with 'parking issues'.

Over on Merseyside for the same time period officers dealt with just four calls from the Finch Farm and Melwood training grounds of Everton and Liverpool.

At Melwood, officers were summoned to reports a group of youths began abusing TV crews and on a separate occasion were hurling missiles over a wall.

At Finch Farm only one call was received when staff spotted an 'elderly person in a state of distress and confusion'.

It was a similar story in the north east where four crimes were reported at the training grounds of Newcastle and Sunderland.

At Newcastle's Darsley Park base, police arrested a burglar in 2012 while at Sunderland's Academy of Light complex officers were called to a complaint of 'religious harassment by letter' in 2013 and two reports of theft, one in 2013 and one in 2014.

According to Staffordshire Police, they were called to Stoke City's training ground a staggering 56 times.

They included complaints of anti-social behaviour, six reports of 'nuisance vehicles' and two reports of criminal damage.

The Metropolitan Police would not release figures but said they had received reports of burglary at Spurs' Enfield base, Crystal Palace's Beckenham complex and West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground.

One report of a break in was reported at Hull City, Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion.
