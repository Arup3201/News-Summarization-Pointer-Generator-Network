England No 8 Ben Morgan has signed a new contract with Gloucester after turning down a move to West Country rivals Bath.

The 25-year-old joins Jonny May and Matt Kvesic in committing to the club. It is a significant piece of business for Gloucester, whose Aviva Premiership rivals Bath will now pursue South Africa back row Duane Vermeulen.

‘Everyone knows how much Gloucester mean to me and my family, so I’m delighted to be staying,’ said Morgan. ‘I’m enjoying my rugby and being part of a talented group who are improving week by week.

‘I believe there is a bright future for the club, and look forward to being part of it.’

Morgan joined Gloucester in 2012 and has been capped 27 times by England. He was named QBE Man of the Series for his displays during the autumn internationals.

He will return from injury to start Gloucester’s match against Exeter at Sandy Park today.

Morgan began his career with the Scarlets, who yesterday tied up the services of Wales lock Jake Ball on a national dual contract.

Ball, 23, attracted interest from Northampton but follows Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Rhodri Jones, Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan in agreeing a joint deal with the WRU and the Regions.

‘Jake’s signing on a national dual contract is another important step for the future of the game in Wales,’ said Wales head coach Warren Gatland. 

‘A player of Jake’s calibre and age attracted serious interest from outside Wales but the introduction of such contracts means another international has committed his future to Wales and his region.’
