There was elation inside the University of Pheonix stadium for fans of the New England Patriots last night as they clinched a historic fourth Super Bowl win.

But some fans were bitterly disappointed after finding out they didn't have tickets to attend the game. One fan started sobbing as he told how a broker charged him thousands of dollars for tickets but then told him they couldn't fulfil his order.

The Super Bowl XLIX earned the dubious accolade of the most expensive game in the event's 49-year history, with some tickets changing hands on the day for as much as $12,000.

Some ticket resellers were apparently engaged in short-selling, a technique where brokers sell seats before obtaining tickets, planning to buy the tickets at a later date for less money in order to make a profit. That technique depends on tickets being available for brokers to purchase closer to the game. 

Chicago-based reseller Vivid Seats was forced to admit to customers before this year's game that it wouldn't be able to fufill ticket orders, despite already taking hefty deposits.

One man waiting outside the stadium in Pheonix said he spent $1,500 per seat for three seat bookings with Vivid Seats, only to get a call days before the game saying 'sorry, we can't fulfil your order'.

The Seattle Seahawks fan from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, whose name was not given, sobbed as he told his story to Fox News Q13.

'For two weeks I thought, for sure, I was going to be in there screaming with the 12th man [pause] and now I don't get to do that,' he said. 'It's tough.

'It's upsetting [pause] that you could just [say] "sorry we don't have your tickets any more".'

Vivid Seats has reportedly been giving 200 per cent refunds to some customers as a result of its failure to supply tickets. But many fans were upset nonetheless.

'Our whole bubble has been popped and I'm just heartbroken,' said Sheila Kissel, a Seahawks fan from Arizona who was handed back her $4,500 deposit, plus another $4,500 on top.

She told ABC News that she and her husband had planned to go to the game with her brother. 

However, her brother died earlier this year and Mrs Kissel had planned to take his ashes to the game instead. 

'That was real special thing we were going to do. So that's hard too,' she said.

Vivid Seats told ABC 15 Arizona that the seller of Mrs Kissel's tickets had told the firm they could not be delivered 'until as late as Sunday'.

'Such a delay in delivery is atypical, and therefore we recognize it could be both concerning and result in a substantial inconvenience for Ms. Kissel,' the company said in explanation for its decision to refund the money. 

There was also speculation that some brokers may have held on to tickets they had already sold because they knew they could get more money selling them to new customers closer to the game.
