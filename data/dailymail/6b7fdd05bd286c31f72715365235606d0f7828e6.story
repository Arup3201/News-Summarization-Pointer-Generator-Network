Looking for somewhere special to celebrate an upcoming wedding anniversary or birthday? Then look no further than the Ty Warner Penthouse at the Four Seasons hotel in New York.

The nine-room suite features cathedral ceilings, semi-precious stones in the bathroom, a grand piano and stunning panoramic 360-degree views of the city that never sleeps.

Of course that kind of opulence and extravagance doesn’t come cheap - far from it – and the cost of a single night stay will set you back a whooping $45,000. 

If I was a rich man: The Ty Warner Penthouse at the Four Seasons New York has been revealed to be the city's most expensive hotel suite costing a whooping $45,000 a night

Living the high life: Not only is the suite New York's most expensive, but it is also the highest hotel penthouse in the city standing 800 feet above the street

The suite, which took $50 million and seven years to build, has just been named New York’s most expensive, according to NewYorkHotels.org.

The 4,300-square-foot suite, which is named after the hotel’s owner, takes up the hotel’s entire 52nd floor and has stunning views of Manhattan. 

The hotel, the flagship of the Four Seasons chain, is the residence of choice for many celebrities when they're in New York. Regular guests include Oprah 
Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Beiber, although it isn't known if any have taken the penthouse.

Owner Warner, the billionaire creator of
 the Beanie Babies, insisted on four glass balconies that run at a 
diagonal to the city’s grid of streets.

The living room features lacquered walls inlaid with mother of pearl and illuminated by a four-foot chandelier made with cut glass and fiber optics, while the throw pillows are made from 18th century Japanese brocade fabric

The master bathroom has gold-colored Chinese onyx covering the walls, floor and ceiling, while the sinks are carved out of a block of rock crystal that is lit by LED lights

Not only is the suite New York's most 
expensive, but it is also the highest hotel penthouse in the city 
standing 800 feet (244m) above the street.

It was designed by architect I.M. Pei, who came out of retirement for the project, and designer Peter Marino, who had previously refused to work on hotel or resort development projects.

In the bedroom, the bed’s Thai silk canopy is made with 22-carat gold threads, while the Hastens Vividus mattress was crafted by hand in Sweden.

The suite also features a spa equipped with a massage table, gym equipment and bamboo trees, it can also be turned in to a second bedroom for extra guests.

If guests want to meditate there is 
also a Zen room featuring a floor-to-ceiling waterfall and views of the 
Empire State Building.

The
 700-square-foot library features a Bosendorfer grand piano set in a 
bronze-clad bay window and surrounded by gleaming walls covered by 
panels lacquered in France. Bronze vines crawl over the built-in 
bookcases as well as the branch-inspired chandelier.

As you would hope for the price you're paying the services offered are equally as opulent. Guests are shuttled around by a personal chauffeur in their choice of a Rolls-Royce or Mercedes Maybach.

The room also comes with a butler who’s on-call 24 hours a day, a personal trainer and complimentary caviar and champagne.

In fact the record-breaking price includes everything the hotel has to offer from treatments in the Four-Star spa to dinner and even breakfast.

The suite, which first opened in 2007, 
had at one time also been the world's most expensive suite until a 
handful of hotels in Dubai began offering even more exclusive digs,
