MIT students celebrated the 50th birthday of Spacewar - one of the earliest computer games, written in 1962 on an MIT computer the size of a fridge.

The game was written by four students in 1962 on a PDP-1 'minicomputer' - last week, MIT students built a new version that ran on a palm-sized electronics rig, based on the original code programmed 40 years ago.

It was one of the earliest computer games, and arguably the forefather of all arcade-style space games.

The game was programmed by four MIT students in 1962 on a PDP-1 'minicomputer', a fridge-sized device. The online version uses the same 40 pages of computer code to run

The code of the game runs to 40 pages, 
and it can still be played online, in a version constantly updated to 
run in the latest browserÂ code.

The game was created in a room known as the 'Kludge Room' at MIT, where computing students would play around with the latest hardware.

The hulking PDP-1 'minicomputer' was a relatively modern machine, with controls that allowed an 'action packed' game where two spaceships battled one another around a sun which pulled them in with gravity.

The game is the ancestor of games such as Asteroids.

Spacewar became a cult hit, being played and adapted by computing students around the world.

It was released as a coin-operated arcade machine called Computer Space in the Seventies, and has been released under various names on many computers since.

The game ran on a PDP-1 'minicomputer'. The programmers shared it with other labs around the world, and other computers added their own variations
