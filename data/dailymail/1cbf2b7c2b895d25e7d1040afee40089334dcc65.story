The Argentine journalist who first noted the significance of Top Gear's controversial number plate has slammed the TV crew's claims that any reference to the Falklands War was a coincidence.

Carlos Cristofalo, the reporter who runs Autoblog Argentina, first spotted what he thought was a reference to the Falklands War on Jeremy Clarkson's 'H982FKL' number plate on September 19.

Tweeting a photo of the vehicle, he asked if anyone else noticed the reference to the 1982 conflict.

Within a few days, the number plate had caused such outrage among locals that the Top Gear crew had been chased out of the country.

In the wake of the incident, Clarkson and other members of the production team claimed the numbering on the plate being a reference to the war was entirely coincidental.

But Mr Cristofalo has now told The Telegraph the suggestion it was a coincidence is absurd given the history of the show.

He said: 'No one who has seen every series of Top Gear can think that it was a casual thing. Top Gear always makes these kinds of jokes.

'We have a profound respect for what Top Gear means to the history of television. But we just regret that Top Gear doesn't respect its audience and dignifies them with a proper explanation of what went on.'

Writing in his column in The Sun after leaving the country, Clarkson later maintained the number plate scandal was not deliberate, and said that if it had been, the BBC would have fired him.

Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black.

He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina.

The Porsche 928GT had a licence plate that read H982 FKL which locals believed was in reference to the Falklands War; Clarkson said his crew changed the plate as soon as the controversy was pointed out to them

Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said.

Government officials were then contacted and asked if the plate would be a problem when they arrived in Ushuaia two weeks later, Clarkson said.

The were told to change it before they arrived, which Clarkson said created continuity issues as the car had already been filmed.

To make up for continuity issues involving the plates Clarkson said the crew created these joke plates which they were going to put on the car to make him look 'idiotic' when he was driving around

Clarkson said they then formed a 'cunning plan' to make-up for the number plate swap. They created joke plates - saying BE11 END - which they planned to film May and Hammond fitting on the car without his knowledge making him look 'idiotic' when he drove it.

But before the crew had a chance to film the scene they were set upon by an angry mob who threw rocks at their cars.

The H982 FKL plates were then removed, revealing an old personal plate underneath, which they left on, then drove off. The cars were later abandoned.

The episode featuring the incident is due to air over two parts on  December 27 and 28.
