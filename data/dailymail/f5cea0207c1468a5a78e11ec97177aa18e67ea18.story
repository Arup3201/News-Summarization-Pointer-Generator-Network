Eoin Morgan was at the centre of a £35,000 blackmail plot over a fling with an Australian woman five years ago.

The England Cricket Board said it had received an email, demanding money be paid or details of Morgan's previous relationship, including videos, would be given to both the UK and Australian press. 

It is believed the demand was made in the last 48 hours, asking for £35,000 to be paid before the first ball in Friday's Tri-series clash with Australia.

'Following liaison with the Metropolitan Police, our support team on the ground in Australia investigated the blackmail.

'This involved approaching the man in question who, when confronted, admitted and apologised for his actions, blaming jealousy (he is presently in a relationship with the woman concerned).'

It is believed the suspect, from Hobart, Tasmania, had discovered an old phone containing details of Morgan's relationship with the woman, and had threatened to reveal its contents. 

Morgan's former girlfriend was reportedly shocked to hear of the plot, which she had no involvement in. 

The cricketer is currently in a relationship with Tara Ridgway, who is studying law and public relations at Bond University in Australia. The couple are thought to have met during the 2010-11 Ashes series in Australia, which England went on to with 3-1.
