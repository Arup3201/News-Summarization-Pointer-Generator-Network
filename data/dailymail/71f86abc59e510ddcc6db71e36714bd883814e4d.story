The British jihadist suspected of killing US journalist James Foley sparked fears of a terror attack at a music festival when he asked to perform before a huge crowd, it emerged today.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - thought to have been behind Mr Foley's gruesome murder in Syria - raised worries among music bosses while trying to get work as a rapper.

He reportedly asked music industry figures in Los Angeles to 'get him to America' before turning angry when he was turned down over his links to extremism.

It was feared Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary  would target revellers at a U.S. music festival, it was reported today

It is said he wanted to perform at the Coachella event in Indio, California and grew angry when turned down

Bary - suspected of being the 'Jihadi John' terrorist -  performed under the name L Jinny before leaving his parents' £1million home in Maida Vale to fight in Syria.

He has since been named as a prime suspect in the killing of Mr Foley, who was shown being killed by an extremist with a London accent in a video broadcast around the world last month.

The Sun today reported that American music managers Jeff Crawford and Jennifer Harris-Crawford became concerned about Bary when he asked them to help him perform at the popular U.S. music festival Coachella.

After initially expressing interest in his music, they pulled out when they discovered his father, Adel Abdel Bary, was awaiting trial for terror charges.

Ms Harris-Crawford told the paper: 'He could be performing and also arranging bombs there. I had this vision of something horrible happening.'

The couple said Bary sent them angry messages after they withdrew offers of support and sent them lyrics to a rap which involved references to beheadings, it was reported.

It emerged last week that Bary's 54-year-old father is now locked up in New York awaiting trial for the bombing of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Early photos of Bary posted online show him wearing western clothes such as Adidas hoodies and rapping in a recording studio.

But later images show him in military fatigues and a mask wielding a machine gun, an AK-47 and an M16 assault rifle.

He is one of three British men who have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed Mr Foley in the brutal propaganda video which shocked the world last month.

The three men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the Islamic State capital of Raqqa, Syria.

The revelations about his planned trip to the U.S. came the day after David Cameron announced police will be given the power to seize the passports of terror suspects trying to join jihadists fighting in the Middle East.

The Prime Minister also unveiled new powers to force jihadis living in the UK to relocate and said airlines will be compelled to hand over passenger lists to increase security.
