If Robin van Persie makes the cut for Manchester United against Stoke on New Year's Day, he'll debut a new look at the Britannia Stadium.

The Dutchman shared on Instagram a picture of himself getting a haircut late on Tuesday as he prepares to see in the New Year with his team-mates ahead of Thursday's lunchtime kick-off.

Alongside the photo, Van Persie wrote: 'Great haircut by The Original Article,Thanks Phil for the haircut, feels like old times @official_kaos'

The 31-year-old had his hair cut by a member of staff from Kaos Hair Designers, a salon based in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.

Given his eight-year spell  Arsenal, it's likely that Van Persie used to frequent Kaos during his time with the north London club.

But with a crucial clash against Mark Hughes' side just around the corner, it appears as though the former Gunners star received a special home visit, which we can only assume was a snip.

Van Persie celebrates scoring his eighth Premier League goal of the season against the Magpies

Van Persie scored a header when sporting his old haircut in United's 3-1 win against Newcastle on Boxing Day.

He was less successful in front of goal two days later as Tottenham battled for a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane, with the impressive Hugo Lloris denying the Dutchman a ninth Premier League goal of the season.

Maybe against Stoke he'll try his luck with a scissor kick.

Victory at the Britannia would help cement United's place in the top four and could even shave the lead of Chelsea, who kick-off against Spurs at 5.30pm, to seven points.
