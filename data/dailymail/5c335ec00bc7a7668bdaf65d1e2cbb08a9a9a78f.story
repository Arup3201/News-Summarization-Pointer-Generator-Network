Tempers flared after a controversial pit stop helped Will Power win an IndyCar race Sunday over Scott Dixon.

With Dixon and Power running a close race, both men hit pit row for a final stop before a sprint to the finish at Sonoma Raceway in California. Dixon was ahead in the race, but directly behind Power in the pits. Pulling out, Dixon’s car clipped one of Power’s pit crew, causing him to incur a penalty and lose the race.

Dixon was irate after the race, saying that Power’s crew got in the way on purpose – and he may have a point.

Fuming: Scott Dixon's car [9] hit a member of Will Power's crew while leaving a pit stop

Footage of the pit stop shows a member of Power’s crew slowly walking towards Dixon’s car while holding a tire at his side. As Dixon begins pulling away, the crew member doesn’t even lift his head.

Dixon’s car strikes the tire, sending it one way and the crew member another, causing him to be penalized and setting Power up for the win. A second Power crew member also hit the ground during the incident.

The analysts covering the race for NBC Sports Network could be heard questioning the crew member’s actions shortly after the incident.

‘It’s tough to put that on Scott [Dixon], you would expect the crew member to do everything he can to get out of the way,’ said one analyst, adding ‘look at him walk there with the tire in his hand.’

‘It didn’t even look like he was looking,’ said a second announcer, adding that the guy was likely thinking that he would make Dixon go around him.

‘I would certainly not place any blame on Scott Dixon for that,’ another analyst concurred.After the race, Dixon was livid.

‘That's probably the most blatant thing I've seen in a long time,’ Dixon said. ‘You watch most pit guys, they try to get out of the way of other people, so that was a bit of a (classless) move, to be honest. … If that's the way they want to try and win, that's pretty bad.’

Out of sight, out of mind: Dixon pulled away thinking he had the race won

‘I would certainly not place any blame on Scott Dixon for that,’ another analyst concurred.Power defended his pit crew after the race.

‘I would be very surprised (if it was intentional). I haven't seen it. It's not even worth commenting on,’ said Dixon.

A race official explained his decision, saying it was clearly Dixon’s fault.

‘With the No. 9 car [Dixon] leaving the pit lane, he clearly crosses right into the pit box into the No. 12 car [Power] space, and that's where the violation occurred,’ race director Beaux Barfield said.

The penalty caused Dixon, who was in the lead, to be dropped 19 seconds behind Power – into 21st place – paving the way for Power’s victory.

All crew members involved were able to finish the race.
