A senior counter-terrorism detective who claimed she wanted to blow the whistle on the phone hacking investigation was jailed for 15 months yesterday.

Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, rang the News of the World to discuss Scotland Yard’s decision to launch a new investigation into phone hacking.

She claimed she made the call because the public should know that counter-terrorism officers were being used to investigate phone hacking instead of ‘saving lives’.

But a jury found her guilty of misconduct in a public office.

Jailing her at the Old Bailey 
yesterday, Mr Justice Fulford said it was ‘a corrupt attempt to make 
money out of sensitive and potentially very damaging information’.

He said he would have sentenced Casburn to three years had it not been for the fact that she is adopting a vulnerable child.

Casburn was in charge of the National 
Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit within Scotland Yard’s SO15 
counter-terrorism command when she made the call to the paper on 
September 11, 2010.

She told journalist Tim Wood that six 
people were under suspicion, including the News of the World’s former 
editor, Andy Coulson, who by that time was Downing Street communications
 chief.

Casburn added that detectives were 
under pressure from Lord Prescott to pursue the inquiry, and that the 
operation was a waste of resources that should be spent fighting 
terrorism. During the trial, Mr Wood said he wrote an email to two 
colleagues after the call stating that a ‘senior policewoman’ wanted to 
‘sell inside information’.

Casburn tearfully denied asking for 
money, and said she had been angry at resources being taken away from 
battling terrorism on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

No money changed hands and the officer was convicted largely on the contents of Mr Wood’s email.

The officer, who carried out work for 
both MI5 and MI6, told the court that during a meeting of senior 
counter-terrorism officers the day before she made the call ‘there was a
 palpable excitement regarding who would get to go and see Sienna 
Miller’, a victim of phone-hacking.

She said working in the Met’s terror 
command was like working in a ‘21st century Life on Mars’ after the BBC 
television show that depicts sexist police attitudes in the 1970s.

In 2011 she was off work for two 
months with ‘situation stress’ following claims of bullying by male 
bosses within SO15. One superintendent admitted that he sent her text 
messages signed with kisses.

Arrested: Former editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks are among those who have been arrested in relation to the long-running investigation

When she was arrested at her home in 
Essex in December 2011, the toddler she was trying to adopt with her 
third husband had only lived with her for a few days.

Patrick Gibbs, QC, defending, had 
asked the judge to suspend the sentence, arguing that what she had done 
did not amount to a ‘breach in relation to counter terrorism’ or ‘a 
breach in relation to hacking’.

He added: ‘It was about being very 
unhappy at work and making a mad telephone call.’  But the judge said 
that such a phone call ‘was a truly dire step for a police officer to 
take’.

He added: ‘If the News of the World 
had accepted her offer Mrs Casburn would have taken the money and 
therefore posed a significant threat to the integrity of the 
investigation.

‘We are entitled to expect the very highest standards of probity from police officers, particularly those in senior positions.

‘It is a very serious matter that men 
or women who have all the privileges and responsibility of public office
 use their position for corrupt purposes.

‘No money changed hands but she revealed the actions of the police and current details of their thinking.’

Casburn is the first person to 
convicted as part of Operation Elveden, the multi-million pound 
investigation into whether journalists illegally paid public officials 
for information. So far, 59 people have been arrested.

The latest arrest was yesterday when a
 33-year-old Metropolitan Police specialist crime and operations 
officer, based in central London, was held on suspicion of misconduct in
 a public office.
