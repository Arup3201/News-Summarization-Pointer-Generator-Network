The BBC was accused of 'disgraceful' bias yesterday over its coverage of Baroness Thatcher's death.

Angry viewers complained its news bulletins gave too great an emphasis to her critics and to controversies such as the poll tax and the miners' strike.

Twitter users accused the BBC of 'shameless' bias against the former Prime Minister. The broadcaster also faced criticism because newsreaders did not wear black ties following the announcement of her death.

During her 11 years as Prime Minister,
 Lady Thatcher made clear her dislike of those running the BBC and 
complained about its 'Left-wing' bias.

In the hours following the announcement of her death, those feelings were echoed by many.

EF,
 London, declared: 'Shameless Marxist BBC, Ken Livingstone. Tony Benn. 
You name the socialist, they've interviewed them to try and ruin the 
memory of this great lady.'

Paul
 Wells said: 'The BBC 10 o'clock news coverage of Baroness Thatcher's 
death is an absolute Left-wing biased disgrace . . . I want a TV licence
 refund now!'

'Baroness 
Thatcher a great leader of 20th Century, BBC brings on the haters and 
emphasises insignificant disturbances. Angry about the bias,' tweeted 
Bazee@Bazee.

Ken Scott 
claimed: 'BBC News showing their left-wing credentials by dragging a 
load of Thatcher haters out for interview. All of them waste-of-time 
has-beens!'

Chris Latimer 
tweeted: 'I am beginning to see the point of view of those who think the
 #bbc is Left-wing. Their coverage of Thatcher's death has been 
disgraceful.'

Concern over the BBC coverage was also
 reflected on Mail Online, where Jiminy posted: 'The BBC allowed a union
 spokesman to be broadcast on Radio 2 news this evening saying that no 
tears would be shed in the North East following Margaret Thatcher's 
death.

'I consider this to 
be the most cynical, nasty thing the BBC has allowed to be broadcast in 
many years. I will be writing to complain. Sickened.'

There
 was also criticism that TV anchors failed to show sufficient respect. 
Huw Edwards, who was presenting a programme on Lady Thatcher on both the
 BBC News Channel and BBC One, was among those who did not wear a black 
tie.

Paul Wells said: 'The BBC 10 o'clock news coverage of Baroness Thatcher's death is an absolute Left-wing biased disgrace. I want a TV licence refund now!'

One Twitter user said: 'Would it be too much for the BBC news readers to put on a black tie and show some respect!?'

Another user, MediaUK.com managing director James Cridland, tweeted: 'No black tie for BBC News Channel presenter? Surprising.'

However, other users noted that BBC presenter Mark Mardell was wearing a black tie, whereas Sky's Adam Boulton was not.

A
 BBC spokesman said he could not comment on whether there was any policy
 regarding black ties, but added: 'The guidance is to dress as 
appropriate, to dress soberly.'

The
 BBC News website made an embarrassing gaffe when it reported briefly 
that Lady Thatcher had died following a 'strike' rather than a stroke.

One of Thatcher's arch critics - former Labour MP Tony Benn - was one of
 the first invited to speak on BBC 5 Live and BBC World Service. Mr Benn

One Twitter user complained: 'Typical BBC left left left! The sooner the TV tax is abolished the sooner we can consign the Labour Broadcasting Company to the bin. This was no typo.'

The BBC also invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to give his views within hours of her death.

Speaking
 on the BBC World Service, he said: 'Working-class communities in 
Ireland were devastated by Thatcherism . . . her draconian policies 
prolonged the war here, she is most famously remembered for the 1980s 
hunger strikes.'

The BBC also invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to give his views within hours of her death

Critics said it was 'disrespectful' to air an interview with Mr Adams on the day of Lady Thatcher's death, given that the IRA tried to kill the former Prime Minister.

Tory MP Ben Wallace said: 'I think it's disrespectful to give such a significant amount of coverage to a man who belongs to an organisation which tried to murder her.'

One of Thatcher's arch critics – former Labour MP Tony Benn – was one of the first invited to speak on BBC 5 Live and BBC World Service and was given free rein to criticise Lady Thatcher.

He said: 'Margaret Thatcher taught us the meaning of class war, we have paid a very heavy price for it.

'She used the power she had to make war on the miners and the trade union movement . . . and it was a very divisive period as Prime Minister, but you have to recognise that was what she believed and that meant she was not just fooling and she did in a sense open up the meaning of the phrase 'class war” as she used her power to make war on trade unions and the majority of the population.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'The death of Baroness Thatcher was a big breaking story of considerable interest to our audiences.

'BBC News sensitively and respectfully reported the story as news of the death broke and continues to provide extensive coverage and analysis across TV, radio and online featuring a range of voices and opinions.' On the use of the word 'strike' instead of 'stroke', the spokesman said: 'This was an error which was quickly corrected.'

* An Irish cricketer has apologised after tweeting that he hoped Lady Thatcher's death had been 'slow and painful'.

All-rounder John Mooney, who scored the winning runs in Ireland's historic win over England at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, has deleted the message.

Yesterday he used his Twitter account to apologise, saying: 'I would like to apologise to anyone that I upset.'

An earlier version of this article carried a stock picture of Mr Edwards wearing a pink tie with a poppy in his lapel.  We are happy to clarify that it was not a picture of Mr Edwards taken on the day.
