A new study shows a majority of Germans have had enough of the Holocaust and want to move on from greatest genocide in history.

On the eve of tomorrow's  commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz, 81 percent of Germans say they want to put 'the history of the persecution of the Jews behind them' and for their leaders to turn to 'contemporary problems.'

The study entiled 'Connecting past, separating present' was conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation to gauge current German-Israeli relations and its findings published in the Bild am Sonntag ahead of World Holocaust Day remembrances.

It also showed that almost half of modern day Germans - 48 percent - have a bad opinion about Israel, 36 percent a good one. 

Israelis quizzed in the same survey had a largely positive opinion of the country which exterminated six million Jews in wartime - some 68 percent approved of the country, more than ever before.

In Israel the survey found that almost one in four people there wanted to draw a line underneath the Holocast, the cataclysmic event of the 20th century which more than any other led to the founding of the Jewish state in 1948.

Pollsters said the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict greatly determines German perceptions of Israel. Stephan Vopel, director of the study and the Israel expert of the Bertelsmann Foundation, said: 'Israelis and Germans have drawn different conclusions from history. 

'The maxim for the the Germans is never again war , for the Israelis, it is never again victims.'

With views of younger generations, the study is a warning: 'We must create more opportunities for direct encounters between the young people of both countries.'

Neo-Nazism continues to be a problem for Germany with far-right groups targetting the young in particular. 

Last year there was a huge scandal when a class of privileged grammar schoolchildren were exposed as Nazi worshippers with some of them putting on fake Hitler moustaches and posting their pictures on to social networking site.

The study said that of the 81 percent who wanted the Holocaust to receed in the natonal consciousness, 58 percent were determined that a line should 'totally' be drawn under it.

Interestingly, younger Israelis proved more critical of Germany than older ones with just 53 percent of under 30's having a positive view of the country. This is despite a massive influx into Germany of young Jews, particularly into Berlin from where the Holocaust against their grandparents was directed.

Eighty percent of elder Israelis - those over 50 - have a positive view of the country and 84 percent of Israelis hope for the continued political support of Germany for Israeli policies.

But in Germany every second citizen is against this and 68 percent want their lawmakers to stop weapons exports to Tel Aviv. Last year a submarine costing half a billion pounds was delivered to the Israeli navy.

There were also differences of opinion between Israelis and Germans about what actually caused the anti-Semitic polices and extermination programme of the Nazis. 

Sixty seven percent of Israelis blamed the German love of authority for the catastrophe while sixty one percent of Germans blamed the economic times and unemployment as the main reasons behind it.
