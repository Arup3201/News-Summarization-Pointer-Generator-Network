Manchester United new boy Radamel Falcao has thanked former side Monaco for letting him seal a loan move to Louis van Gaal's side.

The 28-year-old sealed a deadline day move to Old Trafford after Monaco granted the Colombian permission to find a new club.

Real Madrid were said to be leading the race to sign Falcao until the La Liga giants switched their attention to Javier Hernandez, which allowed Van Gaal to swoop in to sign the highly-rated striker.
