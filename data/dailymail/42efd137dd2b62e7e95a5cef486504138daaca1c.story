A group of determined holidaymakers camped out for 24 hours in chilly conditions in order to secure a sought-after beach hut for the summer.

People started queuing at 10am for one of the small wooden chalets at Avon Beach in Christchurch, Dorset, and the crowd swelled throughout the day and into the cold night.

The would-be holidaymakers set up makeshift camps using deckchairs, sleeping bags and tents to bag their spot and endured overnight temperatures of just 4C.

Hardy would-be holidaymakers set up camp to queue for one of 31 6ft by 4ft wooden beachfront  huts

By the time the administration office opened at 8.30am on Monday there were 30 people waiting to book one of the 6ft by 4ft huts, which were only available on a seasonal let, meaning they will have to be given back at the end of the summer.

At the front of the queue were Martin and Sandra Church from New Milton, Hants.

Sandra and their two children and pet dog arrived at 10am on Sunday to make sure they were first to secure one of the huts - and Martin even took on the overnight shift after he finished work.

He borrowed a fisherman's bed - a sleeping bag connected to a bed - to brave the elements for the second year in a row to ensure they kept the same hut they had last summer.

Martin and Sandra Church were at the front of the line, having arrived over 24 hours early for sign-ups

The couple arrived at 10am on Sunday to ensure that they were first when the office opened on Monday 

Martin, 37, said: 'The huts are so close to the beach and it's a nice beach to take the kids to.

'We queued up for one last year and we spent pretty much every day down there in the summer. 

'Holidays are expensive, the hut costs about £600 for the whole eight weeks of the summer holidays so it's worth it if you use it a lot.

'We wanted to keep the one we had last year so my wife went down early with the kids and the dog and I took over after I finished work.

'It was alright, at least it wasn't raining. The weather was much better than last year.'

Avon Beach has 130 huts lining it, though 50 were destroyed by storms in February last year

Martin and Sandra had their hearts set on securing the same hut that they had used last summer - and got it

Avon Beach has 130 huts lining the quiet sandy beach. About 50 were destroyed by storms in February last year and had to be rebuilt but that hasn't put people off.

Shop manager Laura Huxtable-White said: 'It really surprised me that people got here as early as they did.

'Normally if they are going to queue the day before they get here about 4pm, but we had people queuing from 10am and by midday on Sunday we had about seven. 

'We always offer them the covered area by our ice cream shop to provide them with a bit of shelter and people set up tents and brought Thermos flasks. 

All those who had queued up were offered shelter in the covered area outside of the ice cream shop

There were only 31 huts available for a special offer of £600 for use during the entire eight weeks of summer

'We only had 31 huts available for rent at a special offer of eight weeks on a discount rate.

'It's a nice family beach and a lot quieter than Bournemouth so people are always keen to book it. 

'We've also just replaced all the huts that were destroyed in the storms last year so I think people were keen to get a nice new hut.'

A summer season from July to September costs £650 and a full season April to September costs £900.
