The staff at JB Hi Fi stores around the country are a creative bunch, either that or they're just bored.

Items on shelves across Australia are often accompanied by a witty review, many of which have been spotted by amused customers and posted on a dedicated website online, JB Hi Fi Reviews

Visitors to the website can scroll through a list of the most amusing hand-written reviews, alongside the relevant stock.

Among the amusing list are a video game version of the Tour de France cycling race, which has been given an R rating for 'drug use'.

In another drug-referenced review, employee Maddi recommends viewers planning to watch the popular American television series Breaking Bad 'get addicted' to the show, but to refrain from becoming addicted to crystal meth.

'Get Addicted: Only get addicted to the show though!...JB HI-FI do not support the addiction to meth...'

Another review is written by fictional Star Wars character Yoda, who scribbled a hand-written review  of the game Angry Birds.

'Fear leads to Angry Birds, Angry Birds leads to hate, hate leads to suffering' he wisely observes.

The company itself has no affiliation with the site.
