Argentina's players are now the subject of a FIFA investigation after making a political statement about the Falklands on Saturday night.

The players unfurled a banner which said ‘Las Malvinas Son Argentinas’ (The Falklands are Argentine) before their friendly encounter with Slovenia at the weekend.

The Malvinas is the Argentinian name for the Falkland Islands, the disputed South Atlantic archipelago that has been administered as a British territory since 1833.

That prompted the Football Association to react by ordering England’s players not to respond to any media questions about the Falklands conflict.

Making a statement: Argentina players unfurled a banner claiming the Falklands as theirs during a friendly with Solvenia in La Plata

Don't mention the... England's team have been warned against responding to questions about the Falklands

FIFA officials have confirmed that the action of the Argentina players is being reviewed by their disciplinary department. Once a statement has been cleared by FIFA’s legal department, a form of punishment is sure to follow. FIFA does not allow political messages during matches.

Alejandro Sabella’s team's inflammatory banner was unfurled before its 2-0 friendly win over Slovenia. They will be fined by FIFA because political slogans are forbidden.

Now the FA have banned England’s players from discussing the conflict. After England’s 0-0 draw with Honduras, the FA told every member of staff: ‘Don’t answer questions on (the) Falklands.’

Captain Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Rickie Lambert were the only three players in England’s squad who were born before the Falklands War in 1982 but Hodgson knows his history.

The Falklands War in 1982 saw 649 Argentinian military killed, along with 255 British military over 74 days.

On Sunday, England were dealing with another matter after assistant manager Gary Neville was accused of telling a cameraman to ‘f*** off’ during a walk in Rio de Janeiro.

According to FA sources, Neville finally snapped after being followed for around a mile by a persistent cameraman just hours after the England squad arrived in Brazil for the World Cup.
