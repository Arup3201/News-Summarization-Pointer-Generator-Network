A 21-year-old Kentucky woman has been charged with shooting to death her boyfriend in what her attorney calls an act of self-defense.

Shayna Hubers, of Lexington, was arrested last week after allegedly gunning down 29-year-old Ryan Poston, a lawyer from Highland Heights, Ohio.

At around 9pm on Friday, Hubers called 911 and told the dispatcher that she had shot Poston 15 minutes earlier, and that he had stopped breathing, according to a police report.

When officers responded to Poston's condo at 12 Meadow Lane a few minutes later, they discovered the 29-year-old dead from multiple gunshot wounds, Cincinnati.com reported. They also found a handgun on the scene which was identified as the weapon used in the shooting.

Hubers stopped police while they were questioning her to tell them that she shot her boyfriend in the face and then fired again to put him out of his misery, according to the report.

'I’m not going to talk about the facts of the case, except to say that it is a self-defense case. The only thing she did wrong was having bad taste in men,' said defense attorney Wil Zevely. '...She is a very young and kind person. She would never do anything violent: never has, never would.'

The attorney said his client and Poston had dated for at least a year. The victim’s family and friends described the relationship as 'tumultuous' and 'on-and-off.'

According to the 29-year-old's family, Poston was trying to break up with Hubers and 'move on with his life ' at the time of his death.

'Please keep in mind that the real victim in this tragedy is Ryan Poston, not the woman who shot him multiple times,' his family said in a statement cited by WKRC. 'Anyone who ever knew Ryan knows her claims of self-defense are absurd. We look forward to the day when the truth comes out in a court of law, not from the mouth of a criminal defense lawyer trying his case in the media.'

Bold claim: Hubers' attorney said that the 21-year-old was never prone to violence and shot Poston in self-defense

Hubers appeared in court Tuesday morning via video from the Campbell County jail. No plea was entered, but a visiting judge reduced her bond from $2million cash to $1million cash or $2million property. Later that day, however, Hubers’ bond amount was increased to $5million by the regular judge.

Judge Karen Thomas, who set the higher bond amount, will hold a hearing Friday to explain her rationale for the move, KYpost.com reported.

Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.

'He had a strong feeling of wanting to help people who wouldn't otherwise have access to the legal system and who might be steamrolled by the legal system without someone there to help them,' said attorney Kenneth G. Hawley, who worked across the hall from Poston.

His family and friends have described him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters.

One of his friends, Matthew Herren, told the Kentucky Enquirer that he wouldn't have been surprised if Poston had run for Congress at a young age.

Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major. Zevely said she is close with her parents, and her mother spent the day with her in Northern Kentucky prior to the shooting.

A friend talking to the station WKYT described Hubers as a quiet and sweet girl who was smarter than most of her classmates.
