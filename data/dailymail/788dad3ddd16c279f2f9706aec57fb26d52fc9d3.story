He was just a baby when his father was shot dead - a few days before they would have met.

Now brave Ashton Sexton-Farquhar has paid tribute to the soldier he never saw, laying a poppy wreath in his honour on Remembrance Sunday.

Ashton, now four, made the heart-rending public gesture in Colchester, Essex.

Heart-rending: Ashton Sexton-Farquhar was just five months old when his father was shot and killed by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan. Today he led tributes in Colchester, Essex, by laying a poppy wreath in his honour

Ashton, now four years old, said at the public remembrance event: 'I am very proud of my daddy. He's my hero'

His father Shaun Sexton, a former platoon sergeant with the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, died in 2010 when Ashton was just five months old.

He had spent 14 years as a Paratrooper, serving in Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, before leaving to join a private security firm protecting U.S. aid workers.

The 30-year-old went away on training exercises before being deployed by the firm to the northern Afghan town of Kunduz.

He was just a few days from coming home when he was shot and killed by elite Taliban troops who stormed the compound where he was staying.

His son wore a suit and tie with a poppy today at the Colchester war memorial, on what would have been Mr Sexton's 35th birthday. 

Thousands of members of the public stood 20-deep for the two-minute silence at 11am, one of hundreds across the country which were led by the Queen at the Cenotaph in Whitehall.

The four-year-old laid a wreath and placed a small cross in the soil, saying: 'I am very proud of my daddy - he's my hero.'

Ashton's mother Trudy Farquhar, 37, with whom he lives in Colchester, said: 'Ashton sees dads in uniform picking up their children from school, and that is particularly hard as he knows his dad is not coming home.

'When we walk past the war memorial he says to me: "Am I going to put my daddy's poppies down there?" which is heart-breaking.' 

Bedecked in medals like the veterans beside him, Ashton joined his mother at the service in Colchester

Miss Farquhar previously had two military deaths in her family.

She lost her father Danny Farquhar, who served with the Royal Artillery, on a training exercise in 1982 when she was five years old.

And her cousin, 20-year-old Jamie Janes, was killed by an IED in Helmand province in 2009 - making headlines when Gordon Brown mis-spelt his mother's name in a poorly-written condolence letter.

Mother-of-five Miss Farquhar added: 'It's like history repeating itself in terms of what happened to me with my dad and now Ashton and his dad.

'I don't know anything about my dad and his time in the military because when I was growing up, he was never talked about.

'I am making sure that it is not going to be like that for Ashton and tell him lots of stories about his dad and his nan does the same thing too.

'I want him to be very proud of Shaun and know that he was a hero.'
