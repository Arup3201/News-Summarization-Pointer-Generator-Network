Former Bolton striker Delroy Facey appeared in court on a match-fixing conspiracy charge.

Facey is facing a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery during a brief hearing before a judge at Birmingham Crown Court.

The former Bolton, Hull and West Brom forward is alleged to have committed the offence by offering financial advantage to others, including professional footballers, in November 2013.

Facey, whose former clubs also include Huddersfield, Notts County, Tranmere and Lincoln, was bailed to appear for trial at the same court on April 13 next year.

The 34-year-old, from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, spoke only to confirm his name and address during Monday's hearing.

Officers from the National Crime Agency charged Facey in September as part of what they described as an ongoing match-fixing investigation.

He has denied the charge.
