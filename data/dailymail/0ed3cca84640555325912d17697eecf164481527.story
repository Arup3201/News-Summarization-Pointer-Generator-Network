A neglected chihuahua was kept locked in a cage at a puppy mill for so long the bars had rusted shut.

Vets said the the dog was skeletal and half his lower jaw was missing when he was finally rescued.

Now named Billy, it is believed the dog had not been allowed out of his cage for years.

Confined: Billy had been kept in the cage for so long the bars were rusted shut

Rescued: Billy is carefully taken out of the cage

Love at first sight: Adam Parascandola said he felt responsible for Billy when the dog lay his head on his shoulder

Filthy: Billy was living in squalid conditions and half his lower jaw was missing

He was used as a breeding dog in the puppy mill in Jones County, North Carolina, and when he was past his prime was left 'to rot' in the tiny cage.

However, he has now been given a second chance by rescuer Adam Parascandola who adopted the dog after prying open his cage.

Now Billy and charity worker Mr Parascandola's touching story has used as part of the Humane Society of the United States' latest fundraising campaign.

Workers for the animal charity raided the puppy mill where 88 dogs and one cat were kept in squalid conditions.

Mr Parascandola, who works for the Humane Society, told the Mail Online that vets estimate Billy is about ten years old but there is no way of knowing for sure.

They also cannot never know how long he was kept in the tiny cage.

He said: 'Puppy mill dogs often appear much older 
than they are due to their terrible conditions but we are confident 
Billy is at least 10, though now he seems to 
get younger every day.'

Mr Parascandola said despite helping in dozens of rescue he was shocked 
by the state of the puppy mill.

He said: 'This was his life. What little food and water he and was probably just passed through the bars.

'He was just a skeleton under his fur.'

Adopted: Adam Parascandola decided to adopt Billy because he said he immediately felt responsible for his care

Happy ever after: Mr Parascandola said Billy looks younger every day since he was rescued in March

Happy and healthy: Billy is back to his best

Second chance: Billy has recovered and enjoys playing in his new home

Full of life: Adam Parascandola said within weeks Billy's personality began to shine through

When Billy was found, vets said he had the lowest body condition score possible.

But as soon the dog was freed, he and Mr Parascandola formed an immediate bond.

Mr Parascandola said: 'All the dogs want and need love and attention.

'But when I got this little guy he rested his head on my shoulder and at that moment I felt responsible for him and responsible for making sure he was never going to have to suffer like that again.'

According to the Humane Society, which
campaigns for tougher regulations, puppy mills that sell dogs directly 
to the public are not regulated by federal law.

It estimates that there are 10,000 operating across the country. They are only illegal if the owners 
are cruel or neglectful.

This year alone the charity has rescued 1,050 dogs and 9,000 in the past six years across the US and Canada.

The dogs rescued in this raid in March were kept in small, wire enclosures and many were malnourished or suffering a variety of medical conditions.

They have since been put up for adoption.

Since his rescue, Mr Parascandola said Billy is a happy, healthy dog.

'This little guy, despite all he had been through, really very quickly his whole personality came out.

'It was so wonderful to see what a character he is.

'He makes me laugh every single day. I just love him.'

Mr Parascandola said following the raid two people were arrested and later convicted of 38 counts of animal cruelty each.

They were released on two years of supervised probation, during which time they are not allowed to keep animals.

The charity is aiming to raise Â£1.5million by December 31.
