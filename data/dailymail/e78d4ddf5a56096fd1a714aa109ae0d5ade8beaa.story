The United States has started carrying out air strikes close to an Iraqi dam to stop Islamic State militants from capturing it.

A US. defence official today confirmed the country's air force had commenced strikes around Haditha Dam in western Iraq, targeting insurgents there for the first time.

While Anbar province, where the dam is located, remains in control of the Iraqis, the US offensive was an effort to beat back militants who have been trying to take over key dams across the country, including the Haditha complex.

Air strikes: Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby confirmed today that the country's air force had commenced air strikes targeting Islamic State militants around Haditha Dam in western Iraq

Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the dam is a major source of water and electrical power, and that the air strikes were made at the request of the Iraqi government.

'We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi Security Forces, with support from Sunni tribes,' he said.

Last month Islamic State fighters were battling to capture the Haditha Dam, which has six power generators located alongside Iraq's second-largest reservoir. However, despite their attacks, Iraqi forces there backed up by local Sunni tribes have been able to hold them off.

The group was able to take control of the Mosul Dam in northern Iraq last month, but persistent U.S. airstrikes later dislodged the militants. 

And while fighters have been trying to take it back, the U.S. has continued to use strikes to keep them at bay.

'We will continue to conduct operations as needed in support of the Iraqi Security Forces and the Sunni tribes, working with those forces securing Haditha Dam,' said Rear Admiral Kirby, who has been travelling with US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for talks in Georgia, following the two-day NATO summit in Wales.

US officials have expressed concerns that militants could flood Baghdad and other large swaths of the country if they control the dams. It also would give the group control over electricity, which they could use to strengthen their control over residents.

Earlier this year, the group gained control of the Fallujah Dam on the Euphrates River and the militants used it as a weapon, opening it to flood downriver when government forces moved in on the city.

Water is a precious commodity in Iraq, a largely desert country of 32.5 million people. The decline of water levels in the Euphrates over recent years has led to electricity shortages in towns south of Baghdad, where steam-powered generators depend entirely on water levels.

On Friday and Saturday, the U.S. used a mix of attack aircraft, fighter jets and drones to conduct two airstrikes around Irbil. The strikes hit trucks and armored vehicles. Those operations brought the total number of airstrikes to 133 since early August.

The airstrikes are aimed at protecting U.S. personnel and facilities, as well protecting critical infrastructure and aiding refugees fleeing the militants.
