A mother who ballooned to 14 stone after becoming hooked on Coca-Cola lost more than a third of her body weight in just 10 weeks - after listening to a weight-loss CD.

Jo Hallam, 43, piled on the pounds after gorging on takeaways washed down with a 300 cans of full fat coke every month.

At her heaviest, the 4ft 11in beautician tipped the scales at 14 stone and was a size 18.

But she lost more than a third of her body weight after she met a client for a makeover who had developed a weight-loss CD.

Mrs Hallam was given a CD by Sandra Roycroft-Davis who invented the Slimpod weight loss method.

Users listen to the CD, which gently encourages people to avoid fatty food, for 10 minutes as she fell asleep each night.

Incredibly, Mrs Hallam managed to ditch takeaways and all fizzy drinks and lost an astonishing five stone in just 10 weeks.

She managed to slim down to nine stone and a size 10 dress size between July and September 2010.

Mrs Hallam piled on the pounds after gorging on takeaways washed down with 300 cans of full fat coke every month. At her heaviest, the 4ft 11in beautician tipped the scales at 14 stone and was a size 18

She said: 'I used to drink Coke with every meal, and fizzy drinks always, never anything else.

'But now I feel so much better. The Slimpod helped my diet but the big change was just the drinks.

'Because there’s less sugar I feel more active, my skin feels nicer and my teeth are in much better shape.'

The mother-of-three from Newark, Nottinghamshire, has now been awarded slimmer of the year for using the Slimpod.

She said: 'I felt like there was no way I could lose the weight.

'I had given up after I tried practically everything, I tried slim fast, weight watchers, you name it, but I couldn’t get anything to work.

'It is amazing, the moment I gave up on finding something I stumbled across it.

Within days of trying the weight-loss CD Mrs Hallam was craving water and salad - two things she usually disliked

'When I met Sandra she was looking for people for the trial so I thought why not?

'I popped the CD in as I went to bed and then Trevor (the voice of the Slimpod CD) started talking and I cannot remember what he said.

'But the next day when I got to Lincoln with my mum I just did not want the Burger King meal.

'I wanted water, I used to hate water, and a salad - two things I could not stand.'

Users are advised to listen every day for 21 days at first.

But Mrs Hallam listened to it every day for 12 weeks.

'I was amazed that something so simple could have such a massive impact on my life.

“I got down to nine stone which I’ve maintained for two-and-a-half years through sensible eating and lots of walking. It was almost effortless.'

She would listen to the recording for 10 minutes in the evening. 'And almost overnight I had no urge to gorge myself on junk food any more,' she says.

'Before having children I weighed seven stone and was a dress size six to eight.

'However, during my first pregnancy I ballooned and after having my daughter Kim when I was 20, I weighed 12st and was a size 16 to 18, and I’m only 4ft 11.

'Now I eat and drink the way I used to when I was a teenager.

'I can do all sorts I never used to, I went skydiving earlier this year, I always thought I weighted too much to do that.'

Jo was voted female Slimpodder of the Year in the Thinking Slimmer Loving Life Awards this year.

Thinking Slimmer’s Voice of the Slimpods Trevor Silvester says: 'Jo’s case is a brilliant example of how easily the mind can be re-tuned to feel differently about food and exercise.

'You can lose weight without the drudgery of diets, which never work in the long term any way.'
