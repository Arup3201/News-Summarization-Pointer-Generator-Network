They were his 'three little princesses.'

These are the chilling pictures of murdered nine-year-old Aliahna Lemmon that her 'killer' posted on Facebook one month before he allegedly bashed her in the head with a brick, hacked her to pieces with a handsaw and kept her head in his freezer.

Suspect Michael Plumadore posted a photo of Alaihna standing alongside her sisters - one he was able to take because he had gained the trust of the family after befriending her grandfather James Lemmon.

Lemmon and Pulmadore pair knew each because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together.

On his Facebook page, Plumadore has several chilling pictures of the disabled girl who captured national attention when she went missing from a trailer park in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Thursday night.

Chilling: Michael Plumadore, who allegedly murdered and dismembered 9-year-old Aliahna Lemmon (far right), posted this photo of her and her two sisters on Facebook with the words 'Three Little Princesses'

Why did he do it? Plumadore, 39,  (seen in his Facebook profile photo, left, and his arrest mug shot, right) was a close family friend who Aliahna's mother trusted to look after her three daughters at his mobile home

She and her two sisters were staying with Plumadore, 39, at his trailer while her mother recovered from the flu.

Richard
 Patee, 58, whose trailer is next to where Plumadore was living, said he
 didn't think it was odd that Aliahna's mother had him watching the 
girls for an extended period.

'They
 had known each other for somewhere of three to four years, I know that,
 and he took care of their grandfather,' Patee said. 'I didn't see any 
reason to question it at all.'

Shumaker
 said it wasn't unusual for Plumadore to watch Souders' children 'because the kids liked him.'

Souders and Aliahna were listed among 
nearly 600 friends on a Facebook page listed under Plumadore's name that
 said he was "Self Employed and Loving It!", and enjoyed fantasy novels.

The day after Christmas, Plumadore 
calmly admitted to detectives that he had committed an unimaginably 
horrific crime: Brutally killing young Aliahna and then dismembering her
 body so he could dispose of it.

He led detectives to a dumpster at a nearby business where they found pieces of her torso, arms and legs that had been cut up with a hack saw and stuffed into garbage bags. 

In his freezer, an even more grizzly find -- little Aliahna's head, hands and feet.

'It’s disturbing... This is one of those things that you will never forget,' Sheriff Kenny Fries told the Mail Online.

In 30 years of law enforcement, he said, he has never seen anything like what happened to Aliahna. And he hopes he never does again.

Plumador's Facebook photos reveal that he spent time with the girls at a riverside park in Fort Wayne and was at their home, as well.

One especially horrifying picture was of the three girls leaning against a railing labeled simply 'Three Princesses,' which was uploaded in late November.

All of the pictures were in an online album called 'The kids.'

Trusted: Plumadore met the girls after he moved in with their grandfather, who died this month. He was still living at the grandfather's trailer when he was arrested

Sheriff Fries said detectives have a good idea why he killed Aliahna, but the lawman would not discuss Plumador's motive.

Plumadore cracked during his third interview with police. Detectives had spoken with him twice before  and he had given no indication that he was responsible for Aliahna's disappearance, sheriff Fries said.

The bogus story he first gave to detectives was that he had seen the girl sleeping in his chair at 6am Thursday when he got up to buy a cigar at a nearby convenience store.

He was awakened  realized she was gone when Aliahna's mother called him at 10am, he claimed. He told police he thought that she had left with her mother so she wasn't reported missing until almost 9pm Thursday.

Disabled: Aliahna was hard of hearing and had vision problems. She was suffered from ADHD and had emotional trouble, her family said.

Sheriff Fries said he and his detectives didn't believe his story but they had nothing but his word to go on.

Until Monday. The day after Christmas, detectives 'finally hit the right chords' and Plumadore came clean.

He said used a brick to beat Aliahna in the back of the head multiple times as she stood on the steps outside his trailer. He then wrapped her body in several garbage bags and put it her his freezer, according to court documents.

Despite the confession, the little girl's grandmother, Amber Story, stood by Plumadore.

'I don't care what anybody says. Mike did nothing to her. He loves those girls,' she told the News-Sentinel.

Online: Michael Plumadore's Facebook page has several photos of little Aliahna that are viewable by the public

On Monday, FBI agents descended on the rundown mobile home park in Fort Wayne where Aliahna lived.

The park is a known haven for 
registered sex offenders, though Plumadore isn't on Indiana's registered
 sex offenders list. He has a criminal record in Florida and North 
Carolina that includes convictions for trespassing and assault.

More than 100 emergency workers 
searched Saturday for Aliahna around the mobile home park, where she was
 last seen.

Sheriff's deputies, police officers 
and firefighters fanned out in the area around the trailer park where 
she disappeared, searching on ATVs and on foot. An airplane circled the 
area.

But Sheriff Ken Fries called off the hunt for Sunday, Christmas Day, and ordered only limited searches of area ponds on Monday.

'Family friend': Mike Plumadore, 39, was interviewed by police and taken into custody at 9pm Monday and charged with murder

Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes

Sheriff Fries told the Mail Online 
searchers exhausted every possible hiding place in a one-mile radius 
around the trailer where she disappeared.

'I had dead-bolted the door. When I got back, all the girls was [sic] here.'

Mike Plumadore said he left Aliahna and her sisters in his mobile home Friday morning to buy a cigar

He didn't see any good in using the 
manpower to lead further widespread hunts for the girl, who was feared 
dead as federal authorities took over.

About a half-dozen officers in black 
windbreakers, several of whom identified themselves as FBI agents 
subsequently arrived, some with search dogs were seen at a nearby 
storage facility.

Agents at the scene wouldn't say why 
the FBI was involved. An agency spokesman did not immediately return 
phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.

According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes.

'Children don't just walk away during Christmastime,' Aliahna's step-grandfather, David Story, said Monday afternoon.

Remembrance: Hailey Norris, eight, (centre), stands with her lit candle on Monday night during a candlelight vigil for then-missing Aliahna

Loss: Megan Lehman (centre) stands amongst a crowd of over 50 people who gathered on Monday night

Aliahna's mother, Tarah Souders, 28, 
told The Journal Gazette earlier on Monday that her daughter had vision 
and hearing problems and suffered from attention deficit disorder and 
emotional problems. She also has a history of sleepwalking, family members said.

Aliahna and her sisters were staying at a family 
friend's nearby home because their mother had been sick with the flu and
 Aliahna's stepfather works at night and sleeps during the day.

Plumadore told the newspaper Sunday 
that he left the three girls in his mobile home about 6am Friday and 
went to a gas station about a mile away to buy a cigar.

Authorities have said the store's surveillance video shows him there about that time.

'I had dead-bolted the door,' he said. 'When I got back, all the girls was here.'

He said he smoked his cigar and went 
back to sleep, then woke up about 10am when Aliahna's mother called. 
After that call, he realised the door to the home was unlocked and that 
Aliahna was gone. He said Aliahna's six-year-old sisters told him 
Aliahna had left with her mom.

Rescue team: A search party looks for then-missing Aliahna Lemmon along Brooks Road in Fort Wayne, Indiana on Monday night

Search and rescue: Elyssabeth Fuller, 12, is one of over 40 people who returned after a candlelight vigil to form a search party for the young girl this weekend

Stalled search: Emergency responders fanned out on Saturday to look for little Aliahna but stopped looking the following day

Plumadore said it wasn't until he 
talked with Aliahna's mother at about 8:30pm that they realised she was 
missing and police were notified.

Tarah Souders said miscommunication between the two of them caused the delay in determining that Aliahna had vanished.

'She's never wandered off,' Souders said. 'She's never done anything like this before.'

Elizabeth Watkins, 52, who has lived 
at the park for six months with her four-year-old granddaughter, said it's 
well-known that several sex offenders live in the neighbourhood.

'It's scary,' she said.

'I don't know how a parent could leave their child alone.'
