Heavy fighting has broken out between Syrian troops and Al Qaeda linked rebels close to a stretch of the Levant occupied by Israel.

Government soldiers battled against insurgents from the Nusra Front group near the disputed Golan Heights territory after militants took control of the UN-operated Quneitra border crossing last week.

Several shells struck close to the
 ceasefire line as rocket, mortar and tank fire was exchanged - with Israeli public radio reporting that one stray round hit occupied territory but caused no casualties.

Golan Heights is a 460 square mile region largely seized from Syria by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War of 1967, then annexed in 1981 in a move never recognised by the international community.

This morning Syrian troops battled rebels hard by the armistice line with Israel on the Golan Heights, as the United Nations pressed efforts to free 44 peacekeepers held by the insurgents.

The Nusra rebels - operating as Al Qaeda's militia in Syria - stormed the Syrian side of the Quneitra border crossing on Wednesday and seized 44 Fijian peacekeepers who were working as part of a UN mission that has monitored the ceasefire on the strategic plateau since 1974.

At least one tank belonging to the Syrian army 
loyal to President Bashar al-Assad was also involved and rebels could be
 seen a few metres away from the frontier fence.

The United Nations yesterday said that the Fijians 'continue to be detained by armed elements'.

'At
 this time, no additional information on their status or location has 
been established. The United Nations continues to actively seek their 
immediate and unconditional release,' it said.

More
 than 70 Philippine peacekeepers who had been surrounded by the rebels 
escaped the hot zone over the weekend but the UN mission remained on 
high alert.

Peacekeepers were detained twice last year before being released safely.

Yesterday Israel's military said it shot down a drone that flew from Syria into Israeli-controlled airspace over the Golan.

It was not immediately clear who dispatched the unmanned aircraft or the nature of its mission in an area where fighting from Syria's civil war has occasionally spilled over into Israeli-held territory.

In a statement, the military said the drone was downed by a Patriot missile near the Quneitra crossing between the Israeli-held Golan Heights and Syria.

The
 UN Disengagement Observer Force currently has 1,200 peacekeepers from 
the Philippines, Fiji, India, Ireland, Nepal and the Netherlands.

There has been repeated fire across the ceasefire line since the uprising in Syria erupted in March 2011, not all of it stray.

In
 June, Israeli warplanes attacked Syrian military headquarters and 
positions after an Israeli teenager was killed in what the Jewish state 
said was a cross-border attack by forces.

Israel 
seized 460 square miles of the Golan Heights 
during the Six-Day War of 1967, then annexed it in 1981 in a move never 
recognised by the international community.
