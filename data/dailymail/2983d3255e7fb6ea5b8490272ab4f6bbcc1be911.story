Sol Campbell and his wife Fiona Barratt own a £25million house in Chelsea, and the ex-England footballer claimed the planned mansion tax is unfair

Sol Campbell had the details of his property portfolio read out to him on television by a Labour frontbencher, in the latest row over the mansion tax.

The ex-England footballer claimed Ed Miliband’s plan to levy a tax on homes worth more than £2million was ‘unfair’ and intended to ‘punish’ people who had done well.

He was filmed walking around his lavish home in London’s Chelsea, making an espresso, explaining that he had paid all his income tax and stamp duty and never used offshore tax havens.

Mr Campbell argued that instead of taxing property, Labour should press companies such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon, who were shamed for avoiding tax, to pay their fair share.

But he was attacked by Labour’s Owen Smith, who told him: ‘This is nonsense’. He added that people who were struggling ‘will have zero sympathy with millionaires like you pleading poverty’.

The shadow Welsh secretary then read out a list of all the footballer’s properties while the pair were guests on BBC2’s Daily Politics, although Mr Campbell disputed some of the details.

‘I looked you up before coming here and I see you’ve got a £25million house in Chelsea that you’ve just put up for sale, you’ve got a big country pile in Northumberland and another flat in Chelsea’, the Labour MP said.

‘And I also saw that the place you’ve got in Cheyne Walk [his home in Chelsea], you were renting out for £75,000 a month’.

Mr Campbell, 40, did not dispute the first two properties but said the rental of his home ‘didn’t happen’. 

Mr Smith added: ‘Well you can tell me whether the others are right but we are talking about £3,000 a year extra that you would pay for a £2million to £3million property.’

The footballer said people who could be hit by the tax include families who bought a home in Hackney in north London for £300,000 some years ago and have seen it soar in value. 

He added that properties in Northumberland and the suburbs of Manchester were ‘a long way away from London and oligarchs’.

In his pre-recorded film, shown before he appeared on the show, he said: ‘An Englishman’s home is his castle but under Labour’s proposal for a mansion tax that castle is under threat.

Mr Campbell said he felt politicians should be pursuing companies who avoid paying tax instead 

The former England footballer told BBC2 Daily Politics he was being punished for investing in property

‘Labour’s plans hit those properties valued at over £2million will penalise those individuals who have done well for themselves. Ed Miliband keeps banging on about fairness in society but this tax is anything but fair. And its flawed. 

'Over the years I’ve paid millions in income tax and stamp duty but I’m punished for investing in a property portfolio.

‘I don’t rely on offshore tax havens and I don’t want to invest in stocks and shares…I see this as a tax on aspiration. Labour would be better off targeting companies like Google, Amazon, Starbucks, making them pay a fairer level of tax rather than picking on people like me who have already paid their dues ten times over.’ 

Mr Campbell put his £25m Chelsea property up for sale last month ahead of the clash about the mansion tax

Mr Campbell said the proposed mansion tax would penalise people who had done well for themselves while Owen Smith MP (right) said people would have little sympathy with millionaires like him 'pleading poverty'

Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who was also on the programme claimed ‘Labour’s instinct is to tax everything’. He said the costs of implementing it meant it would not raise the £1.3billion intended and claimed the £2million threshold may have to drop.

Mr Campbell is married to Barratt Homes heiress Fiona Barratt-Campbell. As a defender for Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, until he retired in 2011, he used to earn £100,000 a week.

Their six-bedroom home in Chelsea with views over the Thames went on sale for £25million last month. The Sunday Times Rich List 2013 put his wealth at £33million. He last month suggested he might join the Conservative party and had been in talks about a sports role.

Sol Campbell is the latest celebrity to hit out at the mansion tax, after Myleene Klass attacked Ed Miliband about it on television, and wildlife presenter Bill Oddie said he would not be voting Labour next year as he’s a mansion-owner. London mayoral hopefuls Tessa Jowell and David Lammy have also said it would be a tax on London where 90pc of the affected homes are located.
