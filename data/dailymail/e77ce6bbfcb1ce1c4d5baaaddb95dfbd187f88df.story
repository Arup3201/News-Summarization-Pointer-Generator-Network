Manchester United have taken Watford’s highly-rated Ogo Obi on trial.

Obi, 16, has been monitored by Liverpool and Arsenal since he rattled in an impressive 10 goals in five games at last year’s Milk Cup.

This feat did not go unnoticed by United who have invited the striker to train at their Carrington complex this week after securing permission from the Hertfordshire club.

Watford are desperate to keep the teen sensation and have offered him a place on their scholarship scheme and a one-year professional contract.

However, it now appears no decision will be made on Obi’s future until his stay in Manchester finishes.
