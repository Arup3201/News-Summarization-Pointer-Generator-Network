In days gone by, they were mainly the preserve of Del Boy-style wheeler-dealers.

But now the middle-classes are snapping up fake designer handbags, watches and DVDs.

More than half of all consumers have admitted buying counterfeit goods, according to a recent study.

The research was conducted by consultants from PwC who wanted to explore public attitudes towards the growth in industry of counterfeiting.

Buying fake goods used to be preserve of Del Boy-style wheeler-dealers but has now 'gone mainstream' according to a new survey on attitudes to the counterfeiting industry

They concluded fake goods ‘have gone mainstream’, leaving manufacturers of the genuine articles out of pocket.

While 90 per cent of the public said they considered buying fake goods ‘morally wrong’, it did not stop them acquiring a knock-off watch or Gucci handbag.

In total, 53 per cent of consumers admitted they had bought counterfeit goods – many blaming the fact they could not afford the real thing.

Young people were the worst offenders, with almost two thirds buying fakes such as jewellery and designer clothes.

Affluent professional and managerial classes were just as likely to buy fakes as unskilled workers and those on benefits.

Londoners and people from Northern Ireland were found to be the worst offenders, with Scots the least likely to give in to temptation.

Mark James, head of anti-counterfeiting 
at PwC, told The Times newspaper technological advances and more 
fragmented supply chains were behind the fake goods flooding Britain.

He said: ‘Just as it has never been easier to start your own business, it has also never been easier to start your own counterfeiting business.

‘Not surprisingly, the study found that most people go to the internet to buy fakes, where things are harder to track.’

One of the key drivers behind fake designer clothing and footwear was identified as the rise in the number of websites claiming to offer ‘discount’ or ‘cheap’ luxury goods.

Shoppers are even advised of the best sellers of counterfeit goods on some of the sites.

Mr James added that the British public seemed to be unaware that buying the occasional fake could do any harm.

He said: ‘Consumers are just not thinking of it in those terms. Even when they are asked about deterrents, being caught and the morality of it come behind safety, the fear of losing bank details and the product not being delivered.

‘But there is a cost. Companies are having their reputations, their brands and their revenues stolen and that has a knock-on effect on jobs.’

The Government estimates that counterfeiting costs the economy £1.3 billion a year.
