A supermarket shelf stacker who tried to stop a child urinating in the aisles had a heart attack when his mother reacted with a 30-minute tirade of abuse.

Ling Chen, 45, ran over after she spotted the boy dropping his pants and preparing to pee on a fruit display at the supermarket in Liaoning Province, north-west China.

But the boy's mother, who apparently thought it okay for him to relieve himself on things that others might eventually eat, flew into a rage at Ms Chen's intervention.

Causing a scene: This woman was so incensed at a supermarket worker who stopped her soon urinating in the fruit aisle she launched into a tirade that went on until the shelf stacker had a suspected heart attack

She reportedly shouted: 'How dare you, children need to be able to relieve themselves wherever they want. Everyone knows that they can't hold it in and it's unhealthy.'

When Ms Chen's colleagues came over and tried to calm the woman down she became even more enraged, continuing to scream and shout even when the manager turned up.

Reports claimed that the woman continued her diatribe for 30 minutes, even after both the manager and his staff had been browbeaten into offering profuse apologies.

She only stopped when Ms Chen collapsed clutching her chest and was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack.

The shopping mall in Liaoning Province, north-west China: Incredibly, managers finally apologised to the woman and sent her packing with vouchers and a bag of free fruit for having dared cross her little emperor

Shoppers who witnessed the incredible outburst took photographs as she confronted workers. Wen Su, 42, posted her images online.

She said: 'Despite the apology it didn't placate her and she only stopped when one of the staff members clutched her chest and fell on the floor.

'The woman's husband who stood quietly behind her saying nothing during the incident left with his wife and son after the ambulance arrived.

'The amazing thing is that they left clutching gift vouchers and a bag of free fruit as a further apology from the store.'

One Chinese Internet user said of the pictures: 'Having this kind of parents, I really donâ€™t know how the kid will be after growing up.'
