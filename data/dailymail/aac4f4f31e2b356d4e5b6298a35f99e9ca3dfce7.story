Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva targeted City workers in London's bars, cafes and restaurants, stealing £21,000 worth of goods

One of London’s most prolific thieves has been jailed for three years after stealing £21,000 worth of phones, wallets and computers during a five-month crime spree.

Jobless father-of-three Mario Bustamante-Leiva, 39, of no fixed address, wore a flat cap and a large overcoat even in the height of summer in order to conceal his pickings.

The Chilean national trawled exclusive bars, restaurants and coffee shops looking for laptops, mobile phones, iPods and tablets.

The Old Bailey heard in one case he even stole a bag containing an entire family’s passports and airplane boarding passes.

Police have released CCTV footage which shows the brazen thief swipe an unsuspecting woman’s handbag from under her nose as she chats with a friend.

Bustamante-Leiva can be seen hooking the bag with his foot before quickly leaving the cafe with the handbag tucked under his coat.

He has now admitted 22 charges of theft between July and December 2014.

Judge Christopher Morris QC branded Bustamante ‘dishonest to the fingertips’ as he sentenced him to three years in prison.

The father-of-three was also sentenced to 12 months to be served concurrently for attempted burglary as he was convicted at Inner London Crown Court last November.

His crime spree began in July 2014 in the City and his last offence was committed on November 28 2014, when he stole a bag and ipod at the ‘Counting House’ on Cornhill.

City of London Police detectives identified him as a suspect in November 2014 after he stole a bag in Catch bar on Liverpool Street.

As a result Crime Squad officers reviewed other similar crimes in the City and found that Bustamante-Leiva had also committed these offences.

He was arrested on December 5 2014 when an officer spotted him entering ‘The Monument’ public house in the City, whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from ‘The Counting House’ the previous week. 

‘You are dishonest to your fingertips. Over a five month period you committed a series of thefts from the public, over that long period, to a total of some £21,000,’ the judge said.

‘Before you embarked upon that course of conduct, you had also committed the offence of attempted burglary.

‘I have no alternative, but to order that you be sent to prison.’

Bustamante-Leiva was arrested at the Monument pub in Fish Street Hill on December 5 whilst listening to an iPod he had stolen from The Counting House in Cornhill the previous week.

‘All counts relate to the theft of personal property from sandwich shops, bars and pubs in the City,’ said prosecutor Jennifer Newcomb.

‘He would enter the premises wearing a flat cap, large coat and backpack or large bag over his shoulder, even in the height of summer.

‘He would then stand or sit close to a person who had their bag on the floor or the back of a chair.

‘He would observe them and at an opportune moment remove the bag with his foot or the back of his hand.

‘After he obtained the bag he would hide it under his coat and leave the premises with the bag and its contents.’ 

Detective Sergeant David Morgan from the City of London Police said: ‘These crimes caused a massive inconvenience for the victims, along with anguish for the loss of both valuable and sentimental items, which far exceeds the financial cost of the thefts.

‘Although this thief is now behind bars we urge the public to be vigilant and look after their belongings when socialising in bars, coffee shops, restaurants and clubs.

‘If you witness any suspicious behaviour, please contact police immediately.’
