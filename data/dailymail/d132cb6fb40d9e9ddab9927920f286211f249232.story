The devastating extent of the brain injuries sustained by Formula One driver Jules Bianchi after he crashed into the back of a tractor were revealed on Tuesday.

The 25-year-old Frenchman was diagnosed with diffuse axonal injury — a catastrophic head trauma from which he may never fully recover.

Bianchi, considered to be among the rising stars of the sport, spent a third night in intensive care at Mie Hospital in Yokkaichi following his 110mph freak accident during the closing stages of Sunday's rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix.

'He has suffered a diffuse axonal injury and is in a critical but stable condition,' a statement released by British-based team Marussia on behalf of the Bianchi family read.

Edward McKintosh - Consultant Neurosurgeon at London Bridge Hospital:

'A diffuse axonal injury is a complex condition and it is difficult to assess from the outside how a patient will react.

'An axonal injury is different to a blood clot or a tumour in the brain. The brain cells themselves become damaged, often with the connections between cells sheared off. 

'That impairs the brain's ability to talk to itself. If deeper parts of the brain are injured this can affect blood pressure and a patient's heart rate, which can be fatal. 

'Memory and personality can be affected and if it is severe, people often don't wake up. Bianchi has a chance, but it is an injury with a low recovery rate.'

'The medical professionals at the hospital are providing the very best treatment and care, and we are grateful for everything they have done for Jules since his accident. This is a very difficult time for our family, but the messages of support and affection for Jules from all over the world have been a source of great comfort to us.'

'We are also grateful for the presence of Professor Gerard Saillant, President of the FIA Medical Commission, and Professor Alessandro Frati, Neurosurgeon of the University of Rome La Sapienza, who has traveled to Japan at the request of Scuderia Ferrari. 

'The hospital will continue to monitor and treat Jules and further medical updates will be provided when appropriate.'

A diffuse axonal injury is one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury with a low recovery rate. 

Former Formula One medical boss Gary Hartstein conceded in his  blog that Bianchi's condition is one which is 'usually associated with a sombre prognosis'.

Bianchi's injuries are not dissimilar to the head trauma sustained by Michael Schumacher which left the seven-time world champion fighting for his life following a skiing accident in the French Alps last December.

The German, 45, is now recovering at his home in Switzerland after he was in a medically-induced coma for six months.

Of Schumacher, Jean Todt, the FIA president, said on Tuesday: 'What we can say is that he will probably never again drive a Formula One car but he fights.

'We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone.'

The FIA, Formula One's governing body issued a statement on Sunday regarding the Bianchi accident, which read: 'Adrian Sutil lost control of his car, spun and hit the tyre barrier on the outside of Turn 7.

'The marshals displayed double waved yellow flags before the corner to warn drivers of the incident. A recovery vehicle was despatched in order to lift the car and take it to a place of safety behind the guardrail.

'While this was being done the driver of car 17, Jules Bianchi, lost control of his car, traveled across the run-off area and hit the back of the tractor.

'Once the marshals reported that the driver was injured, medical teams were despatched and the Safety Car was deployed. These were followed by an extrication team and an ambulance.

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a frequent result of traumatic acceleration/deceleration or rotational injuries and a frequent cause of persistent vegetative state in patients. In fact, DAI represents approximately one half of all intra-axial traumatic lesions.

This lesion is the most significant cause of morbidity in patients with traumatic brain injuries, which most commonly result from high-speed motor vehicle accidents. Any patient with a closed head injury who experiences extensive loss of consciousness and neurological deficits warrants neuroimaging.

'The driver was removed from the car, taken to the circuit medical centre and then by ambulance to Mie General Hospital.'

It added that a CT scan had shown Bianchi suffered 'a severe head injury' and that he was to undergo surgery before being moved to intensive care. 

The race, under threat of cancellation in the build-up as Typhoon Phanfone headed towards Suzuka, had already been red-flagged due to torrential rain in the early stages before Bianchi's accident.

During a prolonged dry spell in between, Briton Hamilton caught and passed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance.

The rain then came down again, driving conditions deteriorated and Bianchi crashed out, prompting the red flags to return and the race to be ended with nine laps to go. 

Doctors rush to the scene as it becomes clear that Bianchi has been seriously hurt

Williams driver Felipe Massa has said he had been 'screaming' over his radio during the race about the amount of water on the track, but former FIA president Max Mosley believes 'everything was done as it should have been' in relation to safety.

Asked if Formula One is doing everything right to secure the safety of its drivers, Mosley told Sky Sports News on Monday: 'I think it is.

'I think what happened in Suzuka was very unfortunate, a freak accident.

'But I can't really fault any of the people involved - the marshals or the race director, any of those people. I think everything was done as it should have been.'

Massa said he was trying his best to get the race called off in the run up to Sutil and Bianchi's accidents.

'I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous,' the Brazilian said on Sunday.
