Who wants me? Liverpool centre-back Daniel Agger could be on his way to Barcelona in a £12m deal, according to reports in the Spanish press

Saying farewell: Denmark international Agger has been at Anfield since 2006 but is likely to be on the periphery of the squad next season following the arrival of Dejan Lovren

Rebuffed: Barcelona have seen an approach for PSG defender Marquinhos turned down

Ajax's Daley Blind, Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen and Jan Vertonghen of Tottenham are also being considered but Barca believe Agger, 29, represents the best value.

The La Liga giants have seen an approach for PSG's Marquinhos rebuffed in recent days.

Agger will likely find himself out of favour at Anfield next season following the arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton and a move to the Nou Camp could be appealing.
