One of Atlanta's most eligible bachelors, Mayor Kasim Reed, has today announced he is set to wed former beauty queen Sarah-Elizabeth Langford - and the couple is expecting their first baby.

'I could not feel more blessed that she agreed to marry me, and we look forward to building a family together in the greatest city in America,' Reed, 44, said in a statement.

'I am honored to have our friends and family share this special moment with us and I ask that our privacy is respected as we celebrate this personal occasion.'

The news comes after years of 
speculation that the couple - who've stayed out of the media spotlight despite attending numerous public events together - were headed for the altar.

The Bahamas Press broke the story over the weekend, after spies spotted the beaming couple dining  at the Ocean Club’s Dune restaurant and noticed the impressive rock on 33-year-old Langford’s finger.

'BP almost choked on our steak ’cause we are certain we saw a glittering diamond ring on the Queen’s finger,' the publication wrote.

'News only Bahamas Press can confirm suggests the couple are in the Bahamas and are staying at the beautiful, luxurious Ocean Club on a mini-vacation.'

Although Reed has not commented publicly on the union, Reed's long-time barber told Atlanta Magazine his client sprang the news on him yesterday, after returning from his vacation.

'He sprang it on me as he got up out of my chair,' Rick 
Walker said.

'He pulled up the pictures to show 
me. He looked very happy. I cut his hair just before he 
left last week and had no idea he was going to propose. I just made sure
 he was looking good for his trip.'

Meanwhile, observers have noted the union could be the beginning of a political dynasty, as 
Langford's father, the late Arthur Langford Jr, was an Atlanta 
councilman and Georgia state senator.

Langford's mother, Susan Pease Langford, is a former Atlanta City Attorney.

Langford is a developer and graduate of the University of Michigan and Howard University 
School of Law, Reed’s alma mater. 

But she made a name for herself as a beauty queen contestant, including winning the Miss District of Columbia title in 2005.

The news brings a rare focus on the mayor’s 
private life, which until now has been mainly limited to speculation in gossip blogs.

It's not clear when Reed and Langford first got together, but Straight From the A reported in 2012 that it appeared the pair had 'been on for most of 2011'.

They were also photographed together at an event with Usher in Atlanta in 2008.

The good-looking couple set tongues wagging in 2011 after attending the 28th Annual UNCF Mayor’s Masked Ball together.

It's not known when the couple plans to wed or when their baby is due.
