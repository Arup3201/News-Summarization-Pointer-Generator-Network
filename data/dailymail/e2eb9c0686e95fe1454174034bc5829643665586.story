A dog-walker accidentally killed six pets after locking them in the back of a hot truck for 45 minutes then lied and said the animals had been stolen.

Emma Paulsen sparked a week-long hunt for the dogs - Buddy, Teemo, Oscar, Mia, Molly and Salty - after saying they had been taken from her truck when she left for ten minutes to use a bathroom.

But last week Paulsen confessed to pet investigators that the animals, including her own dog, died after she locked them in her pickup for 45 minutes.

Emma Paulsen, a dog walker, has admitted killing six animals, inlcuing Molly (pictured) a German shepherd-blue heeler cross, after locking them in the back of her truck for 45 minutes on a hot day

Paulsen dumped the dogs' bodies in a ditch then lied to owners, telling them their pets had been stolen, sparking a week-long hunt (pictured, pit bull Mia, left, and Poodle-Bouvier mix Teemo, right)

She now faces a fine of $75,000 (£44,500) or up to two years in prison.

The SPCA, which is leading the 
investigation, will recommend that authorities pursue animal cruelty 
charges, said Marcie Moriarty, the organisation’s chief prevention and 
enforcement officer.

Paulsen reported the dogs missing on May 13 after taking them for a walk in a park in Brookswood, British Colombia.

Speaking to the Globe and Mail Alesha MacLellan, co-owner of Petsearchers Canada, said: 'From the get-go, the story didn’t make a whole lot of sense.

'The washrooms were in sight of where the truck was parked. I’m trying to grasp how someone could so quickly retrieve six dogs that they do not know and get them into another vehicle without anyone seeing. It seemed far-fetched.'

In fact, the
 animals had died of heat exhaustion. In an attempt to cover up her crime, 
Paulsen dumped the bodies in a nearby ditch and claimed the animals had 
been stolen.

Petsearch Canada added: 'Emma disclosed that all six dogs were in the back of 
her vehicle with the side vent windows open and water available, as she 
had done hundreds of times.

'All six dogs 
perished from heatstroke. Upon arriving and Emma seeing
 her beloved charges deceased, she went into a blind panic at the 
thought of notifying the families and the possible repercussions.

'In a
 complete state of shock and panic, Emma made a desperate attempt to 
cover up what had happened and concocted a story to explain the loss of 
the dogs.'

Paulsen told pet detectives the truth, and now faces up to two years in jail after the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommended pressing charges (pictured, Rottweiler-husky mix Oscar)

Writing on a Facebook page dedicated to the dogs, Jenn Ortner, who owned Boston terrier Buddy (pictured) said she was 'devastated and heartbroken' adding 'the tears just won't stop'

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed the dogs’ deaths last week and said that they were still investigating, adding that no charges had yet been filed.

Prosecutors will have the final say on whether to charge the dog walker, Moriarty added.

Writing on a Facebook page, Jenn Myers Ortner, who owned black and white Boston terrier Buddy, said: 'These dogs were our worlds and now we are all devastated and heartbroken.

'I am not sure if we will ever truly mend from this. The tears just won't stop.'
