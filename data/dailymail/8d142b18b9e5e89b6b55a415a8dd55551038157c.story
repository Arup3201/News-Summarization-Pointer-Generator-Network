The Hawaii man who in the 1980s lost ownership of his Famous Amos cookie company is reinventing his brand yet again.

Wally Amos debuted his latest push for a retail rebound this month at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu. The 76-year-old is now selling his cookies at candy store Boardwalk Treats under the name, The Cookie Kahuna.

Mr Amos has reinvented himself more than a half-dozen times since losing ownership of the Famous Amos company, along with use of his moniker and image, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.

Mr Amos started the Famous Amos company in 1975 in Los Angeles. The company ran into financial trouble and Mr Amos eventually lost ownership. The brand is now owned by the Kellogg Co.

His latest venture comes after 
launching other cookie businesses in Hawaii, including Uncle Noname, 
Aunt Della's Cookies, Uncle Wally's Muffin Co. and Chip & Cookie, 
which lost him nearly $1 million.  He has lived in Hawaii since 1977.

Mr Amos says his previous successes and failures taught him to never give up.

'Failure is not failure, but an opportunity to begin again more intelligently,' he told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, paraphrasing Henry Ford.

'I love that quote. On my worst day I never thought I should quit. You are guaranteed to fail if you quit. But if you find the tenacity to keep going, eventually you will succeed.'

He said he plans to launch online sales in the coming weeks at TheCookieKahuna.com.

'I'm setting up to do some 
real business, to make some real money and spend some time with the 
people that have always helped me," he said.

'I don't have that money 
yet, but it's right around the corner.'
