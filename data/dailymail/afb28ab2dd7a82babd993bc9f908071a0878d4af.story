She's the flame-haired make-up artist who is credited with transforming the likes of Penelope Cruz, Millie Mackintosh and Cara Delevingne.

So it's fair to say that Charlotte Tilbury, who is Kate Moss' go-to make-up artist and best friend, knows a thing or two about beauty.

The make-up maestro, who has created the looks for the glossiest of Vogue covers and starriest red carpets, has released a short tutorial for her mature fans called 'a youth-boosting, naturally glamorous make-up for the 60 plus woman'.

Makeover: Charlotte Tilbury, right, has created a tutorial on how to achieve a youthful look for over 60s - and called on her 65-year-old mother Patsy, left, to help. Here is the finished look

With a little help from her 65-year-old mother Patsy, Charlotte provides a step-by-step guide to creating a youthful look.

'Women who don't make the effort and stop wearing make-up literally age overnight,' explains Charlotte as she whips out an arsenal of her best products to use on her mother.

Charlotte preps Patsy's skin with her 'magic cream', which she describes as a secret mix of patented anti-age ingredients, a hyaluronic acid booster plus floral extracts that lift and transform the skin.

As she applies a primer and foundation, she explains that her products are packed with retinol, which is extremely important for over 60s skin.

'It's really youth boosting and plumps the skin up and makes it look really glowing. That's what you lose as you get older.

'And as we know, too much sun ruins your skin, it's beauty suicide,' she explains.

She then uses a retouching pen to take out any age spots, unwanted freckles and blemishes before sweeping powder over the skin and creating a defined brow.

'The brow defines the face, it's the pillar of it,' she says before using an eyebrow pencil she created with the help of good friend and client Cara Delevingne.

'Cara really brought back the brow,' she adds before telling her mother how important eyelash curlers are for opening up the eyes.

Charlotte then uses a smudger brush to create a soft smokey eye inspired by the 'golden goddesses of Ibiza' and adds a subtle slick of eyeliner and lots of coats of mascara.

'Pop bronzer onto your forehead and onto your cheekbones as the sun would naturally hit you and some highlighter onto the C-section of skin, which paints a sort of candle light onto the skin,' she says.

Before and after: Charlotte's mother Patsy was treated to a 'glamorous goddess' makeover, which she often recreates on Kate Moss and supermodel Gisele

Charlotte also emphasises the power of lipstick. Patsy muses: 'If I was 
stranded on a desert island, I would want a lifetime supply of lipstick 
to look glamorous when I was rescued.'

'As you get older, your lips shrink and your face begins to collapse,' says Charlotte as she shapes Patty's lips with lipliner and shades it with a natural pink hue.

The final stages involve blushing your cheek in what Charlotte calls a 'swish and pop' movement before defining your jaw line with powder.

'This
 is a golden goddess look I would use on Gisele and Kate Moss,' says Charlotte.

'It's designed for 17-70-year-olds and proves that by
 using modern, pretty colours, it instantly makes you look younger and 
softens you.'

Charlotte, 40, has been working as a make-up artist for 20 years and is regularly called on by the likes of Adele and J-Lo to help them get red carpet-ready.

Most recently, she made over Sienna Miller and Cara Delevingne, as well as Kate Moss, for the supermodel's Topshop launch party and gave Poppy Delevingne her wedding look.
