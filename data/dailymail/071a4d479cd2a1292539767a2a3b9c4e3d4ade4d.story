The luxury home of Aston Villa's £18million striker Darren Bent has been burgled in the countdown to Christmas, with thieves snatching two top-of-the-range cars from his driveway.

Raiders struck in the early hours of Saturday morning, breaking into his Little Aston property near Sutton Coldfield while he was fast asleep, swiping keys to a high-spec Range Rover worth £80,000 and a luxury Audi RS6.

Police confirmed the home was occupied but would not say if the player was there. 

The Audi RS 6 quattro, commonly referred to as the RS6, is the highest-performing version, and a top-of-the-line £80,000 specification of Audi's A6 executive motor.

Striker Darren Bent's home was targeted early Saturday morning after thieves broke in through a window

England international Bent, signed by Villa in 2011, is currently on loan with struggling championship side Brighton and Hove Albion.

Staffordshire Police were called to the address at 3.15am and discovered locks on a uPVC window had been snapped.

Following an 'orderly' search, thieves had found car keys and driven off with the vehicles.

Following a record-breaking move to the Midlands, he made only one start for Villa this season before joining Brighton in November.

Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said the break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows.

'Offenders have snapped the lock cylinder in two by applying force to the cylinder,' he said.

The method of 'lock snapping' is becoming more prevalent among thieves as it can be completed within a matter of seconds.

The crime caps a frustrating year for Bent, who has also played for Premiership sides Spurs, Sunderland and Villa.

But 80 per cent of fans taking part in recent survey wanted the 30-year-old to be a part of Villa's starting 11.

Bent said of his month-long stint at The Seagulls: 'I wasn't getting a lot of game time at Aston Villa and it doesn't bother me that I've had to drop down a division to play football.

'I've seen Brighton play and they play like a Premier League team. They play good football. That's why I wanted to come here and join them.' 

Bent's representative did not respond to a request for comment.

Bent joins a growing list of football superstars who have been targeted by criminals. 

Bent also had an Audi RS6 (similar to the one pictured) stolen from his home during the burglary. Thieves broke into his home and took the keys to his luxury cars from inside the house

Police are warning homes using cylinder locks, like those the thieves broke at Bent's home, are extremely vulnerable to burglary.

A practice known as 'lock snapping' has been disseminated among criminals whereby  locks featuring a cylinder are able to be easily snapped. Once broken and removed, thieves can then manipulate the locking mechanism and open the door.

Sergeant Richard Morris of Staffordshire Police said Bent's break-in highlighted the pitfalls of cylinder locks on windows.

He said: 'Thieves have devised methods of snapping these types of cylinders locks in a matter of seconds while still being able to operate the lock to open the door.

'They’re then able to look for the keys to the cars they’ve seen outside and drive them away.

'This threat can be reduced simply by upgrading the cylinder to one that is specifically designed to prevent this method of attack. We recommend that all vulnerable doors using Euro-Profile cylinder locks be upgraded to incorporate ‘Break Secure’ cylinders.'

In 2001, then Everton striker Duncan Ferguson (pictured) fought off two burglars from his Merseyside home

Stoke striker Peter Crouch and his wife Abbey Clancy have also been the victims of two break-ins.

The couple were said to be 'distraught' after thieves broke into their Cheshire home and turned the house upside down looking for jewellery in 2011.

Entering through a kitchen window, the criminals made off with a number of rings, thought to belong to Clancey, as well as a watch and a laptop computer.

And in 2010, Martin Wilson, 22, admitted to his role in the burglary of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's home.

Gerrard's wife Alex Curran was home with the couple's children when Wilson and the gang smashed into their home, threatening to take her children if she did not hand over jewellery and cash.

Gerrard was in Marseille at the time playing in a Liverpool Champions League tie.

Former Scottish footballer Duncan Ferguson also once detained a man who broke into his home in Rufford, near Liverpool.

Playing for Everton at the time, the striker confronted a pair of thieves. Although one managed to flee, his partner in crime spent three days in hospital after having been detained by Ferguson until police arrived.
