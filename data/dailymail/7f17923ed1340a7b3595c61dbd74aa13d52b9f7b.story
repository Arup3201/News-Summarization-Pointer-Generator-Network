Australian air strikes against terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq are helping check the militants' momentum, a senior defence chief says.

Australian super hornets have contributed more than 180 sorties since operations against militants began in October as part of an international mission to disrupt and degrade IS.

More than 100 munitions have been deployed by super hornets against 44 targets, destroying 36 and damaging a further six.

Chief of Joint Operations Vice Admiral David Johnston says IS is coming under immense pressure from Australian led airstrikes

During ground operations, Australian Special Forces are training local Iraqi soldiers in counter-terrorist tactics, co-ordinating air-strikes and managing dozens of improvised explosive devices.

Chief of Joint Operations Vice Admiral David Johnston says IS is coming under immense pressure.

'The militants' momentum has been checked since the air campaign commenced,' he said in a statement on Saturday. 

Last month, an Australian F-18 Super Hornet military plane discovered a clandestine network of  bunkers occupied by the Islamic State in northern Iraq, giving rise to an enormous airstrike and the death of over 100 militants.

The plane, fitted with regular and heat-seeking night cameras, located the concealed bunkers and tunnels in a hillside at Kirkuk, before groundforces and 20 aircraft lashed the area.
