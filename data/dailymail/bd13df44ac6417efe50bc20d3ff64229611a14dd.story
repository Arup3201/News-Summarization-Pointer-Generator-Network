David Cameron is planning new powers to muzzle Islamic hate preachers accused of provoking terrorist outrages such as the killing of soldier Lee Rigby.

The Prime Minister wants to stop extremist clerics using schools, colleges, prisons and mosques to spread their ‘poison’ and is to head a new Tackling Extremism and Radicalisation Task Force (TERFOR) made up of senior Ministers, MI5, police and moderate religious leaders.

The high-powered group will study a number of measures, including banning extremist clerics from being given public platforms to incite students, prisoners and other followers – and forcing mosque leaders to answer for ‘hate preachers’.

It will also urge Muslim ‘whistleblowers’ to report clerics who act as terrorist apologists to the police.The launch of TERFOR signals a major overhaul of the Government’s counter-terrorism strategy in the wake of the brutal murder of Drummer Rigby on Wednesday.

A senior Whitehall source said: ‘The PM is determined to challenge the poisonous narrative of extremist clerics and confront religious leaders who promote violence.’The move comes as:

Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier

The Government, police and security services and religious and  ethnic leaders have all struggled to come to terms with the Woolwich outrage. Government insiders say Mr Cameron’s new TERFOR group is intended to ‘disrupt’ the activities of extremist clerics wherever they preach their ‘hateful message’.

One said: ‘We are looking at  the 
range of powers and current methods of dealing with extremism at its 
root, as opposed to just tackling criminal violent extremism.

‘And we will look at ways of disrupting individuals who may be influential in fostering extremism.

‘We
 cannot allow a situation to continue where extremist clerics go around 
this country inciting young people to commit terrorist acts.

‘We will do everything we can to stop it.’

The
 source stressed that Mr Cameron was ‘aware of the importance of 
avoiding a kneejerk reaction,’ and added: ‘This new group will study the
 issue in great depth  before acting.

‘There
 is no question of restricting freedom of speech – this is about 
preventing people spreading the message of extremism and radicalisation 
in a totally irresponsible  and reckless way.

‘We
 cannot stand by and let people whip up violent hatred of Britain and 
its values and culture with  the appalling consequences that we have 
seen.’

Mr Cameron will tell moderate Muslim groups they must be much more proactive in condemning  pro-terrorist clerics.

He
 believes that while mainstream organisations such as the Muslim Council
 of Britain have unequivocally condemned the slaughter of Drummer Rigby,
 they have failed to take a similar firm stance in the past.

Mr Cameron
 will also ask police and security chiefs for more details on the number
 of young  people who have been radicalised like Drummer Rigby’s 
murderers.

‘It is hard 
to measure the extent of radicalisation but we know there are many 
hundreds of individuals,’ said one source.

‘We have to encourage clear 
condemnation from groups that those vulnerable to radicalisation may 
listen to. TERFOR will want a better assessment of the size of the 
problem so they know what they are dealing with and can counter it.

‘We
 must find ways to identify and tackle radicalisation in places which 
can be very hard to reach, such as unregulated schools and madrasahs.

'We must ensure imams and other religious leaders are not promoting extremist messages.

‘Mosque committees need to be held to account for the choice of imams they make.

‘And those attending religious services need a route to express their concern about extremist messages they hear at mosques.’

It was revealed that Woolwich suspect Michael Adebolajo was known to MI5 after being held over terror charges in Kenya and deported to the UK.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that Adebolajo was offered cash by MI5 to work for them – then sought legal help to ‘get them off his back’ after refusing to do so.

Cleric Omar Bakri described Adebolajo as a ‘hero’ for remaining at the murder scene.

Two-thirds of Britons backed a clampdown on hate preachers in a Mail on Sunday poll, which also found strong voter support for the way Mr Cameron reacted to the  horrific incident.
