A woman had to be rescued from her burning home after a pair of hair straighteners were left switched on her wooden floor and started a blaze.

The woman collapsed in the fire this morning, after the hair straighteners had been left turned on and were lying on a wooden laminated floor.

She had to be rescued by firefighters, who discovered her on the first floor landing in the north London property.

Charred: The straighteners were left switched on, and are believed to have cause the potentially fatal blaze

Firefighters took a picture of the twisted, charred remains of the straighteners, after they overheated and caught fire.

The electrical hair straightening appliances are extremely popular across the world, and can reach temperatures of 200C.

But they are increasingly blamed for burn marks and injuries by customers who accidentally touch the red-hot plates against their skin.

They can also burn through materials when left on.

Finchley fire station Watch Manager Tony Keating said: 'We believe the fire was started by hair straighteners being left on.

'Fortunately the woman was woken by a smoke alarm and dialled 999. When crews arrived they found her unconscious and not breathing on the first floor landing.

'She was brought out of the property and firefighters started resuscitation before ambulance crews arrived. 

The fire brigade were called to Morton Way, in Southgate, after a blaze began when the hair straighteners were left on (general view)

'You should never leave hair straighteners switched on and they should always be used cautiously and with care.

'The incident also highlights the importance of a working smoke alarm which sounded and this helped save her life.'

Two fire engines from Finchley fire station with 14 firefighters and officers tackled the blaze on Morton Way, Southgate, north London which badly damaged the loft conversion. 

The fire started at 5am and was put out at 6am today.

The woman was treated by the London Ambulance service and taken to hospital.

It is the second time in a week that hot hair straighteners have been linked to the cause of a fire with potentially fatal consequences.

Two young boys were rescued from a bedroom in a house in Pinner, north London, last Thursday by firefighters after a fire was started by hair straighteners.

The children, aged 4 and 5, were taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation by the London Ambulance Service and a woman escaped from the house before the fire crew arrived.

Two fire engines from Northolt with 14 firefighters tackled the blaze.

It’s thought the woman had been using her hair straighteners and accidentally left them switched on when she answered the phone and then went downstairs to open the door for a takeaway pizza.

It's believed she went down to collect the food, leaving the hot straighteners on a pile of clothes, which then caught fire.

In December last year, High street stores stopped selling children’s hair straighteners after a dramatic increase in burns injuries.

The brightly coloured straighteners – decorated with pictures of princesses, fairies and cartoon characters – are high on Christmas lists.

But doctors became concerned by the increasing number of girls suffering burns and scars from the electrical appliances, which are being marketed with images more suitable for a toy.

The stores – Argos, Tesco and Asda – acted after worrying figures from the National Burns Injuries Database were released.

The statistics revealed the number of children aged under 15 admitted to serious burns units in England and Wales with injuries from adult appliances increased from 162 in 2009 to 252 in 2011.

But these figures are merely the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and could be at least ten times higher, according to University Hospital South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust, which collated the figures.
