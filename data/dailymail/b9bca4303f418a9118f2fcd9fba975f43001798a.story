All natural: Victoria Beckham has not had botox, says her dermatologist

She's admitted to having boob jobs, but Victoria Beckham has never used botox, fillers or lasers, says her dermatologist.

Dr Harold Lancer claims the 39-year-old transformed what was uneven, acne-blighted skin into a smooth and blemish-free face simply by paying attention to her lifestyle and skincare regime.

He said: ‘Victoria Beckham is a natural beauty.

'She’s an incredible health nut – she watches her diet, her exercise, she sort of leads an ideal healthy life.

'She’s an example of how skincare products can be used to convince tissue to heal itself from the outside in and the inside out.’

The Beverly Hills medic added: ‘She suffered badly from acne but [her skin now] is totally self resolved.

'She pays meticulous attention to product use and lifestyle.

‘And I supervised all of it so I assure you nobody has touched her with any surgical implements or lasers.

'She’s an example of self discipline.

‘I always advise acne patients to modify their diets so they have no dairy intake, no caffeine intake, and next to no sugar.

'This means their carbohydrate intake has to be under 20 per cent of their calorific intake.

‘I’m the only skin doctor who she’s ever seen, so trust me on this one.’

A more competitive type of indoor cycling class, devised  by New York fitness experts, is attracting an array of celebrity fans, including Jessica Alba, Sofia Vergara,  Jimmy Fallon and Matthew Broderick.

Called Flywheel, it combines powerful music and uplifting instruction with a new, high-tech ‘torq pack’ which measures your speed and power to give a race ranking and exact calorie-burn count.

‘Flywheel is extremely fun because I’m a little bit competitive,’ said Jessica, right. ‘During the sprints, you can see where you’re ranking in the class and go harder to make your number better.’

The class’s co-founder, Jay Galluzzo, says: ‘Jessica loves our intense, inspiring classes  and the technology.’

The first class opened in London last year, at Shoreditch House, and there are now plans to extend further into the UK.

Cranberry juice could make your body healthier overall, says new research.

Adults who regularly consumed the drink had better cardiovascular profiles than those who didn’t – even though there was no difference in overall calorie intake, said the US study.

Drinking cranberry juice – which has long been a go-to drink for cystitis – was associated with smaller waist measurements, a reduced likelihood of being overweight or obese and a lower risk of infection or inflammation.

All in your head: Agony may be 'all in the mind'

People who believe their pain will have catastrophic effects feel it more severely – meaning pain may be ‘all in the mind’, says research.

Psychological factors are increasingly seen to have a major impact on how much you feel pain, explaining why different people have different pain thresholds.

The study of 100 patients with knee arthritis tested how much they ‘catastrophised’ pain and how badly they felt on six-minute walks.

The research at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, showed that the more patients feared pain from walking, the more pain they actually felt.

And the amount of pain felt can have an impact on recovery as  that often requires exercise.

Jane Tadman of Arthritis Research UK says: ‘It’s always been a strange phenomenon that people with osteoarthritis, who may have the same amount of cartilage damage, have completely different levels and experiences of pain.

‘There is a large “psycho-social” aspect to chronic pain. We’re carrying out research looking at the way the brain processes pain, anticipation of pain and whether there are abnormalities in brain mechanisms, which if targeted, could offer a more effective way of dealing with chronic pain than traditional painkillers.’

Yoga really can create positive physical changes in the body, new research reveals. A study by Ohio State University looked at 200 breast cancer survivors who had never practised yoga before.

Half were given twice-weekly 90-minute sessions for three months while the other half continued not to practise it.

Blood tests taken before and after the three months showed that cytokines – proteins in  the blood that can show inflammation – were lower by  ten to 15 per cent in those doing yoga. One theory is that yoga aids sleep and cuts stress, which in turn reduces inflammation.
