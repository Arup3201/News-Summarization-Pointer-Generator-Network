The NFL's decision to ban rifle maker Daniel Defense from airing a commercial during Superbowl XLVIII has led to protests from America's gun lobby.

In the clip, a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint, suburban home.

He pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk, briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers.

'No one has the right to tell me how to defend them,' he says of his wife and baby.

The company's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of 'the most effective tool for the job', an AR15 assault rifle.

The ad was banned last month for flouting the NFL's gun rule which state: 'Firearms, ammunition or other weapons are prohibited; however, stores 
that sell firearms and ammunitions (e.g., outdoor stores and camping 
stores) will be permitted, provided they sell other products and the ads
 do not mention firearms, ammunition or other weapons.'

Following the NFL's ruling, Daniel Defense offered to replace the company's logo with an American flag and/or the words 'Shall not be infringed'.

Last year's Superbowl, broadcast by NBC from Indianapolis, saw record prices for advertising spots.

The Associated Press put the price at $3.5 million to $4 million for
 30 seconds. Less than 20 years ago, a half-minute of Super Bowl ad time
 cost less than $1 million.

That money now buys the largest TV 
audience in the U.S. Two years ago, a record of more than 111 million 
Americans watched the Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers, and 
many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game
 breaks.

Stephen Master, head of sports for Nielsen, which tracks viewership, said: 'There's nothing to compare it to. Maybe the Oscars or some of the music (awards) shows, but not really.'

The company was willing to replace the gun with an American flag or the words 'Shall Not Be Infringed'. But the NFL wouldn't budge.

In an interview on Fox and Friends, Daniel Defense CEO Marty Daniel said: 'We actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and got a big no.'

Petitions in support of the ad have followed - such as one titled 'Allow Daniel Defense to show their SuperBowl commercial supporting Freedom!' - along with cries of support on the company's Facebook page.

One poster, Shawn Butt, said: 'Alcohol and automobiles are both responsible for more deaths than firearms. But the NFL doesn't seem to have a problem with either of those.'

A YouTube video in response to the ban complaining that the NFL has become 'politicized' now boasts more than two million views - far more than the original commercial.

Super Bowl XLVIII will pit the Denver Broncos against the Seattle Seahawks on February 2 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
