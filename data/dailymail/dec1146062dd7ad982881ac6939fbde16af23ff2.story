San Antonio won comfortably at Atlanta 114-95 in Sunday's clash of two teams with form lines heading in opposite directions leading up to the NBA playoffs.

The Spurs have won three straight and the Hawks have lost three straight, though they can afford to ease up given they are still eight games clear atop the Eastern Conference, ahead of Cleveland, which won at Milwaukee.

In the key games among playoff aspirants in the West, the Los Angeles Clippers defeated New Orleans, and Phoenix won a close one against Dallas.

Paul Millsap finished with 22 points for the faltering Hawks.

The Clippers won a fourth straight game by beating New Orleans 107-100.

Blake Griffin scored 23 points and Chris Paul contributed 23 points and 11 assists for Los Angeles, which converted 18 Pelicans turnovers into 30 points and had a 25-6 advantage on second-chance points.

The Mavericks rallied from a 17-point, third-quarter deficit and were up 86-80 with 5 minutes to play, but then went four minutes without scoring while the Suns climbed back into the lead.
