The Secret Service has arrested two men in two separate White House security breaches that have occurred just hours apart, sparking lockdowns at the presidential mansion. 

On Sunday night, an unnamed suspect stepped over a bike rack situated outside the White House fence.

The bike racks were installed last year following a high-profile fence-jumping incident that involved an Army veteran armed with a knife. 

Early Monday morning, another person attempted to walk through a gate while a construction crew were leaving.

Breached: The White House, pictured Monday, has become the site of two new security breaches that took place just hours apart and sparked lockdowns 

Sneak: A man tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area

According to NBC, both men were taken into custody, and the Secret Service has given the all-clear at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

The agency has been tight-lipped about the two breaches, which are now under investigation. The suspects have not been named.

The bike rack-jumping incident took place at around 11.30pm Sunday near the southwest corner of the presidential residence, reported MyFox DC. 

The male suspect was arrested and charged with unlawful entry. The breach led to a 30-minute lockdown at the White House.

Just before 7am Monday, another man allegedly tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area.

A Secret Service agent stopped the intruder in his tracks and arrested him after a brief confrontation.

The White House was placed on another lockdown that lasted only a few minutes following the second incident.

The twin security breaches come just over a month after a small drone operated by a government employee accidentally crashed on the South Lawn of the White House.

The Secret Service has come under scrutiny following a string of distressing incidents involving White House security.

In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled.

The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest.

The White House was briefly on lockdown this past August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

In an interview on ABC's This Week Sunday, Joseph Clancy, the newly appointed director of the Secret Service, said his agency is working to 'regain the trust' of the public after the litany of security breaches, reported USA Today. 

‘We have not received an unfair rap,’ Clancy said.’I think when you fail, and we have failed, we own it. Now, it's up to us to correct it.’

The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. 

Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. 

January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment.

The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device.

October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service.

September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured.

The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. 

And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. 

June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House.

November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.
