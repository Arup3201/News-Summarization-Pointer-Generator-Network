JONATHAN McEVOY INTERVIEW WITH NICO ROSBERG: I've got your number, Lewis! Maths fan Rosberg out to beat old rival

Nico Rosberg has posted the fastest time in practice for the Malaysian Grand Prix.

The German driver, who won the season opener in Australia a fortnight ago, maintained Mercedes' impressive form at the second round of the championship.

Kimi Raikkonen was second, with Sebastian Vettel third and Lewis Hamilton fourth quickest. Earlier, Hamilton was quickest in the morning session in Sepang.

Setting the scene: Nico Rosberg carried his Australian Grand Prix form through to Malaysia after posting the fastest time

Keeping up the good work: Nico Rosberg was fastest in practice for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix

Facing the media: Lewis Hamilton was fourth in the second practice session of the day after posting the fastest time in FP1

On track: Hamilton was fastest in the day's opening practice session in Sepang

Rosberg posted a lap time in his Mercedes of one minute 39.909secs, but with Raikkonen and Vettel in close attendance.

Raikkonen, appearing strong at this 
venue where temperatures hit 34 degrees centigrade after a disappointing
 second debut on his return to Ferrari this season, finished just 
0.035secs adrift.

As for 
Vettel, whose race at Melbourne's Albert Park ended after only a handful
 of laps due to a cylinder failure in the Renault engine, the 
26-year-old finished 0.061secs down on German compatriot Rosberg. 
Hamilton was 0.142secs behind his team-mate.

After
 starting from pole position in Melbourne, Hamilton completed just two 
laps prior to his engine also suffering a cylinder failure.

On the move: McLaren's Jenson Button was eighth fastest in the second session of the day

Over
 the intervening period the team opted to execute a fix rather than 
going for a change as the engine forms just one component of the power 
unit this season.

Over the 
course of the campaign only five power units are allowed per driver, 
beyond which grid penalties start to apply, forcing Mercedes to seek a 
cure and so not compromise Hamilton later in the year.

Overall,
 the top six were covered by a fraction over two tenths of a second, 
with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and former team-mate Felipe Massa, now 
with Williams, also in the mix.

Daniel
 Ricciardo, disqualified in Melbourne over a fuel irregularity with his 
Red Bull, was 0.367secs down on Rosberg, with a gap then of over three 
tenths of a second to McLaren's Jenson Button.

Max
 Chilton finished 3.7secs back in his Marussia in 18th, ahead of 
team-mate Jules Bianchi, with Caterham's Marcus Ericsson 20th and the 
last of those to set a timed lap.

Team-mate Kamui Kobayashi failed to complete a single lap in the second session due to a problem with the car's energy store.

Issues: Romain Grosjean failed to post a time in today's practice session for Sunday's race

Welcome along: Bernie Ecclestone takes a stroll in the pit-lane on Friday

NICO ROSBERG COLUMN: Melbourne victory is only the beginning for me, and why I'll sweat FOUR litres in Sepang

Pastor
 Maldonado, who managed just two installation laps in FP1 before wisps 
of smoke emerged from his Lotus, also did not see any action in FP2 due 
to an apparent issue with the turbo.

Team-mate
 Romain Grosjean, who completed only four installation laps in the first
 session due to further problems with his car, at least completed 14 in 
the later run.

However, the
 Frenchman ran into gearbox issues and was forced to pit, leaving the 
team with further headaches after the trouble they encountered in 
Australia.

Back on track: After retiring from the season-opening race, Sebastian Vettel was third quickest on Friday

The duo started 
at the back of the grid in Melbourne such were there woes Down Under, 
before completing 43 and 29 laps respectively prior to suffering 
failures with the energy recovery system.

Such
 distances were viewed as minor triumphs at Enstone, but despite time 
since then to work on reliability, the issues are continuing.
