Key documents about the murder of Alexander Litvinenko must stay secret, a court ruled yesterday.

The coroner investigating the poisoning of the former KGB man in London seven years ago was set to make public a government dossier relating to the case.

But yesterday three judges over-ruled him, saying releasing the information would cause ‘significant damage to national security’. The High Court decision is another blow to the campaign by Mr Litvinenko’s family to discover the truth about his murder.

Secret documents: The government today won a legal battle to keep documents linked to the Alexander Litvinenko inquest secret

Last night his wife Marina said she feared the alleged role of the Russian state in his death might never be exposed.

She is planning a legal challenge to force ministers to hold a full public inquiry – an option they ruled out earlier this year.

Mr
 Litvinenko was poisoned in 2006 by a radioactive substance, polonium 
210, after meeting two fellow former KGB agents at the Millennium Hotel 
in Mayfair. He died three weeks later.

The
 two spies, Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun, both deny involvement and 
Russia has refused to extradite them for questioning in the UK.

The
 coroner, Sir Robert Owen, had argued that some of the material 
ministers want to keep secret should be made public to ensure a ‘fair 
and meaningful inquest’. But Government lawyers claimed the documents 
were ‘sensitive to the highest degree’.

Yesterday,
 Lord Justice Goldring and two other judges at the High Court in London,
 agreed. Lord Justice Goldring said he was ‘driven to the conclusion 
that the weight the coroner gave’ to the Government’s view ‘was 
insufficient and amounted to an error of law’.

He
 said the issues in the case ‘concerned the risk of significant damage 
to national security’, adding ‘nothing we have decided reduces the 
importance of open justice’.

Through her lawyer, Ben Emmerson QC, Mrs Litvinenko said she was ‘disappointed but not surprised’ by the judgment..

The
 mother of one said she would prepare instead for her appeal against the
 Government’s decision not to hold a public inquiry. This would be her 
last attempt ‘to see the truth emerge about the Russian state’s 
responsibility’ for her husband’s death, Mr Emmerson said.

In
 his ruling, the coroner had excluded large amounts of secret documents 
from the inquest, including those relating to the Russians.

He
 also agreed to exclude any material about whether the British security 
and intelligence services could have saved Mr Litvinenko’s life. The 
nature of the material he agreed to include has not been revealed.

Last year the inquest was told Mr Litvinenko was working for MI6 as well as the Spanish secret service.

He had fled to London with his family after falling out with his superiors and twice being arrested.
