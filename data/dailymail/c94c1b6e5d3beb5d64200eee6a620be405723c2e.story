Mr Murphy, pictured, said he now wanted to take a case to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to make a formal complaint against Gunner's treatment

A much-loved pet dog was accidentally given a lethal injection by a vet – who then told its owner: ‘Mistakes do happen.’

Nicholas Murphy, 22, took his Jack Russell, Gunner, to the veterinary practice after a persistent cough failed to go away.

Staff told Mr Murphy they would give the 14-year-old dog an injection, which he believed to be a dose of antibiotics.

But what should have been a routine visit took a tragic turn when it emerged the injection had in fact been a lethal cocktail to put the dog down – not medicine to help with his cough.

The mistake only emerged when the vet asked the family if they wanted to bury Gunner at home or at the surgery.

And when Mr Murphy – an animal welfare worker himself – questioned the vet about the error, he simply replied: ‘Mistakes do happen.’

The incident at the DJB Denny practice, in  Worcester, left Mr Murphy and his family ‘shellshocked’ and ‘confused’, he said. 

Mr Murphy, who lives in Worcester with his mother Karen Wood, 48, sister Hannah, 17, and brother Paul, 14, added: ‘He asked us if Gunner had had enough, I just thought he meant of the cough, then he gave him an injection.

‘He never asked us anything about the injection, he just put the needle in Gunner. There was no consent form, and no permission. He admitted he was wrong to me and said he was very sorry.’

Mr Murphy, who has lodged a complaint against the vet, said the lethal injection had been carried out in front of his brother.

Mr Murphy said all Gunner needed was 'stronger tablets' instead of the lethal jab

He added: ‘I never got a chance to say goodbye to Gunner. We had to bring him home and bury him, the whole time we were just in shock, I was numb.’

Vet David Denny yesterday explained how the tragedy had happened. ‘I was told by my receptionist they wanted the dog put down. It was a mistake, an accident, a breakdown of trust.

‘It was a very old dog, but the whole thing was a genuine mistake and I have apologised.’

Ian Holloway, a spokesman for the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said it could not  comment on individual cases. He added that it would investigate all complaints received.
