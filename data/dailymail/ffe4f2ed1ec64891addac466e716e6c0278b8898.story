This is the moment a gun-wielding robber demanded 'money, money!' as he brandished an AK47 assault rifle at his terrified victims.

Mohammed Ali, 26, used the terrifying weapon to carry out two raids in east London - one in which he stole £400 from William Hill and another in which he threatened staff in Barclays, but failed to get anything.

Ali, of Bow, east London, was jailed for 
seven years today at the Old Bailey after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of an imitation firearm - because the gun was deactivated.

Shocking crime: Mohammed Ali was captured on CCTV threatening frightened staff AK47 assault rifle

Small gain: Ali pleaded guilty to two robberies on betting shop William Hill - when he got away with £400 - and on Barclays - when he escaped with nothing

He was identified as the gunman after an investigation of more than two years by the Flying Squad at Barking.

Police tracked him down using mobile phone records, arrested him in November 2011 and he was charged on 23 February 2012.

Last month Ali admitted involvement in two out of six raids investigated by the Flying Squad.

Ali and an accomplice approached cashiers in a Stepney branch of William Hill on Tuesday 9 June, 2009, just after 9.30am.

Ali brandished the AK47 and shouted 'Money, money!', before fleeing with £400.

On Saturday 25 July, 2009, at 4.30pm, Ali and an accomplice ran up to the counter in Barclays in Bethnal Green, demanding money.

Aggressive: It took police more than two years to 
track down 26-year-old Ali, pictured, using phone records. He has now 
been jailed for seven years

Ali smashed the gun against the glass, cracking it with the force he had used. The staff hid and the robbers were forced to flee empty-handed.

Enquiries revealed Ali had bought a deactivated AK47 from a company in Wales and had it delivered to his work address in Aldgate. This gun has never been recovered.

He was jailed for four years for the 
first robbery and three years consecutive for the second, with two years
 concurrent for the firearms charge.

The Recorder of London, Peter Beaumont QC, said: ‘You used an imitation AK-47 to intimidate staff into handing over money.

‘The total sentence is seven years imprisonment.’

Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Neil Turner said: 'We are pleased at today’s sentencing, which means a very dangerous man is now behind bars.

'Ali used a military weapon on the streets of London to commit armed robberies, terrifying his victims who were just trying to carry out their everyday business.

'His conviction comes after a lengthy investigation by the Flying Squad, which demonstrates our tenacity and commitment to tackling these types of crime.'

Ali’s accomplice, Mohammed Ghaoui, 22, of Wembley, was jailed for four years in December 2009 after pleading guilty to robbery and possession of a firearm in relation to the William Hill robbery.
