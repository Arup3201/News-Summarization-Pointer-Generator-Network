Some time in the future, probably long before he is king, Prince George of Cambridge will be flicking through the family album when he pauses at a particular photo.

It shows a middle-aged man clasping the hips of a woman in a party frock, pursued by a gyrating blonde with her arms aloft, all shimmying in single file across the dance floor.

‘What’s grandpa Middleton doing?’ the prince will innocently ask. ‘That’s called the conga, Your Royal Highness,’ an aide explains. ‘It’s a dance popular on package holidays and often performed by people imbibed of drink.’

Party time: Michael Middleton joined a conga line at a British Red Cross gala event in Knightsbridge

Celebrities: Mr Middleton danced his way past legendary footballer and football manager Mark Hughes

Good-hearted: The presence of the Middletons at the charity ball suggested that their daughter Catherine inherited her charitable streak from them

Big spender: Mr Middleton handed over £20 notes to a fundraiser who was dressed as a nurse

The Duchess of Cambridge’s father 
Michael was taking part in the dance at a British Red Cross Ambassadors’
fund-raising gala in London.

Ten minutes before midnight, as a 
flamenco band played, the 64-year-old sprang to his feet and joined a 
line of guests snaking its way around dinner tables at a Knightsbridge 
hotel, where the £350-a-head event was staged.

It weaved enthusiastically past 
celebrities and notables from a guest list that included Brideshead 
Revisited actor Anthony Andrews and his wife Georgina Simpson, actress 
Jenny Agutter and a number of footballers.

Not to mention Carole Middleton, the mother of our queen-in-waiting.

Friendly: The Middletons posing with Anthony Andrews and his wife Georgina Simpson

Elegant: Mrs Middleton was dressed in a black gown with a stylish grey throw

Support: Mrs Middleton with Maria Shammas, chairman of the British Red Cross's international fundraising

Ball: The event was held in the Jumeirah Carlton Tower, a hotel in Knightsbridge

Mrs Middleton did not join the 
hand-to-hip hangers-on with her husband in the conga, a spectacle that 
Kate, perhaps, could fairly have described as a mildly embarrassing spot
of ‘dad-dancing’.

Mr Middleton – who once donned an 
inflatable Sumo wrestler suit to surprise the family at Christmas dinner
– looked less confident when singled out by the gala compere and a 
roving microphone.

But even after apparently sticking to
soft drinks for much of the evening, he did hand over a generous wodge 
of £20 notes to a fundraiser dressed as a Red Cross nurse, and happily 
posed for photo with celebrity guests (although in fairness, it might 
have been the other way around).

The event raised more than £240,000 for the British Red Cross.

Getting in the spirit: Mr Middleton showed he was a good sport as he hit the dancefloor

Observer: Mr Middleton looks out at the goings-on in the star-studded party

Embarrassment: The Duchess' father cringes as he is singled out by the event's compere

Daughter: The Duchess of Cambridge met a number of Armed Forces members selling poppies yesterday

Vivid: The £350-a-head event was held in a well-appointed ballroom in the luxury hotel

Dance: A group of dancers showed off their skills to the appreciative crowd
