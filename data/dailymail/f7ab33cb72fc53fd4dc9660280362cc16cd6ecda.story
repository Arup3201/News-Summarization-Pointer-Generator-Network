Heather Dureen Hegre, 20, has been arrested over claims she stole a man's wallet on their first date

A 20-year-old Wisconsin woman faces theft charges after running off with a man's wallet on their first date.

Heather Dureen Hegre struck up conversation with Jeffrey Mack, 23, from North Plains, Oregon, on the dating website MeetMe.com and the two met in person at around 10pm on Monday at an Arby’s restaurant in Wilsonville.

Hegre apparently got into Mack's car at the drive-thru, where he bought her a milkshake. 

But when he placed his wallet down on the center console of the vehicle, Hegre grabbed it and disappeared.

The Oregonian reports that there was only two $1 bills in the money holder - change from a $5 bill Mack used to buy the milkshake.

After being robbed, Mack called 911 and provided police with Hegre's cellphone number. 

Officers then called to arrange a meeting with her at the same Arby's restaurant.

They arrested her early Tuesday morning and recovered the wallet - with the two $1 bills still inside. 

Sergeant Dan Kraus of the Wilsonville Police Department told The Oregonian that Hegre confessed to taking the wallet. 

A subsequent search of her maroon minivan revealed hypodermic needles, two jars of hash oil, marijuana pipes, a weighing scale and a pill bottle containing what is believed to be methamphetamine.

Hegre was booked into the Clackamas County jail before being released on police bail pending further investigation.

She faces charges related to the theft of Mack''s wallet as well as drug possession. 

'It will not go down as a good first date. But at least [Mack] got his wallet and his $2 back,' Sergeant Kraus concluded.
