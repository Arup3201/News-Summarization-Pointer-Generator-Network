The first arrests using new hate crime measures have been made after a 16-year-old boy was punched in the face.

The teenager, described as an ‘emo’, was attacked days after a policy protecting sub-cultures came into effect.

The boy was allegedly punched in an unprovoked attack at 6.30pm in Ashton, Greater Manchester, as he walked with a younger friend.

The new policies at Greater Manchester Police were sparked by the murder of Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was attacked in a park with her boyfriend who took exception to her appearance

‘Emo’, or emotional, is a rock music genre. Fans typically wear black, skinny jeans and hoodies.

Police have arrested a 44-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy.

The victim’s friend, 14, who was also 
attacked, said: ‘If they are going to classify crimes like this as hate 
crimes, that’s good because it could make the punishment more severe.’

The case is the first since Greater 
Manchester Police adopted procedures which mean offences against goths, 
emos, punks and other sub-culture groups will be recorded as hate 
crimes.

They will be added to offences aimed 
at people due to their race, disability, sexual orientation or because 
they are transgender.

The campaign for the law was led by 
Sylvia Lancaster, whose daughter Sophie, 20, was killed in 2007 because 
of her ‘goth’ outfit. Last week she said: ‘Hopefully other forces will 
follow GMP’s lead.’

The man and boy, of Manchester, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and bailed until May 7.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan
said the attack was the first recorded sub-culture hate crime. He said:
‘It is unfortunate this incident happened but the fact we were able to 
identify this as a hate crime is very positive.’

The two people held after the attack 
on the 16-year-old were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning 
actual bodily harm after the attack in the Tameside area on Monday.

The pair have been released on police bail until May 7.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry 
Shewan, of GMP, said: 'Officers will be reviewing CCTV and speaking to 
witnesses in order to investigate this attack thoroughly, as we do with 
all crimes.

Sylvia Lancaster set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in memory of her daughter to campaign against intolerance

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said the use of the new measures was 'positive'

'It is unfortunate that this incident 
happened but the fact we were able to identify this as a hate crime is 
very positive. Just last Thursday we announced that we will now record 
alternative sub-culture as a hate motivation.

'We hope this encourages victims to continue to come forward so we can take positive action against offenders.'

Sylvia Lancaster set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation which campaigns against intolerance and prejudice.

Sophie and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, 21, were beaten without provocation as they walked through a park in Bacup, Lancashire, in 2007.

Mr Maltby was beaten unconscious and as Sophie cradled his head in her lap, she was set upon by two of them.

Sophie, who was due to start an English degree at university a month later, suffered horrendous injuries.

She survived for 13 days in intensive care before the decision was made to switch off her life support machine.

Ryan Herbert, 16, admitted murder and was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. Brendan Harris, who was convicted after a trial, was given a minimum term of 18 years.
