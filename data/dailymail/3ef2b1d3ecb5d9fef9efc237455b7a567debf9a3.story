There is no rest for the Royals.

Weeks after her Olympic win hard working horsewoman Zara Phillips is eventing again, this time in the Hampshire countryside.

And the blonde took time out to refuel on a tasty looking crepe as she walked the course in the sunshine.

Wearing tight white jodhpurs, a navy fleece and a casual cap the 31-year-old ditched her riding boots to show off a pair of bright pink golf style socks as she chowed down on the French snack, whose tomato based filling seemed to burn her mouth.

The young royal is competing on her horse Black Tuxedo at the event set in the Hampshire grounds of the Duke of Wellington's estate.

Attractions at the event, aside from the Olympic medal winner, include dog agility competitions, a gun dog display and welly wanging as well as a fun fair.

No doubt Zara's proud husband will be supporting his wife of one year at the trials.

Throughout the Olympics England rugby player Mike Tindall was one of Team GB's most vocal cheerleaders, ferociously tweeting his support for Zara and her teammates Nicola Wilson, William Fox-Pitt, Mary King and Kristina Cook.

He even admitted that her winning the silver medal better was better than lifting the rugby World Cup.

He said: 'That Olympic silver, in my book, is right up there with my World Cup medal, if not above it, because it was won at the London Games with so much expectation and pressure.

‘When England won the World Cup we were favourites to do so. Team GB’s eventing silver wasn’t expected, so to produce that collective performance was outstanding.'

Eventing is an equestrian triathlon combining three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries.

Sometimes known as 'Horse Trials' the event features dressage, show jumping and cross-country and uses a penalty point scoring system.

Eventing is considered to be the ultimate test of equestrian skills.

The first phase, dressage, shows the horse's and rider’s ability to perform a series of prescribed classical movements on the flat in an enclosed arena.

The second phase, cross-country, involves the horse and rider galloping over natural terrain, jumping a variety of fixed obstacles along the way.

The third phase, show jumping, sees the horse and rider jump a series of stadium fences in an enclosed arena.
