Ashya King could fly to Prague for potentially life-saving treatment as early as tonight after his parent’s were finally given permission to take the desperately ill boy out of a Spanish hospital.

Brett and Naghmeh King were granted their wish by a High Court judge – eight days after they removed him from a Southampton hospital following a row with doctors and drove to Spain.

The five-year-old brain tumour patient will fly by private jet to a specialist hospital in the capital of the Czech Republic as soon as possible after he was deemed in a 'perfect condition to travel'.

Family lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz said today that the youngster could fly to Prague as early as tonight, Sunday, or Monday at the very latest.

New hope: Brett, pictured outside the Malaga hospital with his son Danny today, and Naghmeh King were granted their wish by a High Court judge - eight days after they removed him from a Southampton hospital

Urgent treatment: Ashya's mother Naghmeh and father Brett, pictured leaving the Malaga children's hospital today, asked for the five-year-old, pictured last year, to be transferred to a private hospital 560miles away

Best course of action: Ashya's parents now hope that it is not too late for their son to get the treatment he desperately needs to prevent the cancer cells from regenerating

The family's lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz (pictured on Sky News today) said the youngster could fly to Prague as early as tonight, Sunday, or Monday at the latest and said he was in a 'perfect condition to travel'

Ashya is expected to receive a course of chemotherapy at a children's hospital before being given proton beam therapy which his parents believe will give him the best chance of survival.

The lawyer said: ‘We’ve got the judge’s order. We’re very happy. It’s wonderful news. We’ve got a private jet virtually ready to take Ashya out of hospital.’

He also said the brain tumour patient was in 'perfect condition' to travel at the moment and had been playing with his family and toys.

Mr Justice Baker made the decision after receiving a detailed plan outlining the treatment Ashya will receive.

He was also provided with evidence that the boy’s parents have enough money to pay for the treatment at the Proton Therapy Centre and travel costs.

The extraordinary development came hours after Ashya’s family were effectively ‘held hostage’ by a Spanish hospital which refused to release him.

His parents asked for him to be moved from the state institution to a private hospital 560miles away so he could start chemotherapy.

The children’s hospital in Malaga treating Ashya had refused to allow him to leave without permission from the British courts, telling his parents: ‘He’s going nowhere.’

August 28: Brett and Naghmeh King wheel their Ashya out of Southampton General hospital after disagreements over his care. Family flee to Spain. Six hours later, hospital alerts Hampshire police.

August 29: Police warn ‘time is running out’ for Ashya as he needs specialist equipment. He becomes a ‘ward of court’ in the UK.

August 30: European Arrest Warrant issued. Members of the public spot the family. The parents are arrested and Ashya is taken to a children’s hospital in Malaga.

August 31: Ashya’s brother Naveed posts a YouTube video denying neglect. Southampton hospital claims that it offered the family a second opinion. Parents appear at a Malaga court before being transferred to Madrid.

September 1: Parents told they will stay in custody after they refuse to be extradited.

September 2: Kings freed after arrest warrant dropped.

September 3: Ashya and his parents are reunited. Kings are told they must submit Ashya’s treatment plan for approval by  doctors. A charity agrees to cover the cost of proton beam therapy.

September 4: Negotiations continue over Ashya’s treatment.

September 5: Ashya was due to fly out to Prague for treatment after a judge agreed to allow his parents to take him there.

Meanwhile, the family’s lawyer stoked up bad feeling by saying that a British court had no right to decide the boy’s future because it did not have jurisdiction in Spain.

As pressure to resolve the impasse mounted, Mr Justice Baker held a telephone conference with lawyers yesterday afternoon to thrash out a resolution.

Ashya’s parents now hope that it is not too late for their son to get the treatment he desperately needs to prevent the cancer cells from regenerating. The couple want him to have proton beam therapy rather than traditional radiotherapy.

Last week they fled to the south of Spain where they were arrested following a manhunt and forced to spend three nights in separate cells in a Madrid prison.

Following a national outcry, they were released and reunited with their son. As he is still a ward of court, the parents had to submit a care plan to doctors at Southampton General yesterday.

Ashya’s grandmother said: ‘At 4pm yesterday, we’d lost all hope. Now, he’s on his way to Prague.’ Patricia King added: ‘We’re overjoyed that he’s finally getting treatment and we are so relieved.’

The seriously ill boy remains a ward of the High Court. However, this will be dropped when he reaches the Prague hospital.

Experts there have studied Ashya’s records after they were sent over by the University Hospital Southampton Trust on Tuesday night.

The treatment is likely to cost between £60,000 and £65,000. The Proton Therapy Centre claims its therapy is less than half the price of comparable treatment in the US.

Family lawyer Juan Isidro Fernandez Diaz had said that the decision to make Ashya a ward of the court had ‘no validity under international law’ because he is in Spain and not Britain.

‘The High Court can say it’s got custody but Ashya is in Spain and under international law it can’t execute the ward of court power,’ he said.

Next stop? Tonight it remained unclear whether the boy was flying straight to the private clinic in Prague (pictured) or was stopping off at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra, in Pamplona, northern Spain

Earlier Mr Diaz said: ‘Ashya  will be going to a private clinic in Navarra. His parents are very happy with the doctors they have contacted, with the treatment that has been proposed and with the results of that treatment.’

A source at the Malaga hospital said: ‘The director of the Materno-Infantil Hospital received a formal request for Ashya’s transfer to Navarra Hospital. We have replied saying his parents must obtain the permission of the High Court first and until that happens, he’s going nowhere.’

The source said the hospital was puzzled by the request for the move to the private Navarra facility because the family would have to pay for treatment it was currently getting for free.
