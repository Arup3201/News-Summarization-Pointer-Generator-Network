‘Robben is a big player, he is not a kid anymore,’ said the Chelsea boss as part of his role as Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador.

‘He is thirty years old, it is probably his last World Cup in the maximum of his potential and Robben is showing everything he has showed during his career, the quality he has.

‘But at the same time he is showing a physical condition and mental condition that we have to say is really amazing and I’m happy for him because he’s a very good guy.

‘He is fighting in an unbelievable way and leading his team, and for me this is fantastic, this is absolutely fantastic.’
