Barcelona forked out £25million to sign the right back, who has won 16 trophies during his time at the Catalan giants, from their La Liga rivals.

Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta recently said the club were no closer to agreeing terms with the 31-year-old. 

'We're talking about the contract with him,' Zubizarreta told AS. 'We'll see what the road is we'll take. It's also influenced by the decision of FIFA [the transfer ban].

'The best thing is that we come to see an incisive Dani, that's important.'
