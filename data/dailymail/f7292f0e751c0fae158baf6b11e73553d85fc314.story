Google's deal with Apple as the default search engine on Safari (pictured) expires in 2015. Reports claim Yahoo and Microsoft are pitching for the slot

Firefox turned its back on Google as its default search engine last week, and Apple may be looking to do the same. 

Google has been the default engine on Apple's Safari browser for the past five years, but the deal is due to expire in early 2015. 

This could see Microsoft's Bing or Yahoo taking its place - or the tech giant could be working on developing a search engine of its own. 

Both Yahoo and Microsoft have already started canvassing Apple about becoming the default engine on iOS devices and Macs, according to The Information's Amir Efrati.  

Mr Efrati said Apple is likely to base the decision on the 'quality of the product as much as the potential money made from search ads.'

Google reportedly paid Apple $82 million (£52 million) in 2009, and $1 billion (£636 million) last year for the partnership.

Search engines make money from such partnerships by sending traffic to their servers, and profiting from ad revenue.

But Apple has been distancing itself from its rival for sometime. 

When it launched iOS 7, the default search engine for Siri was Microsoft's Bing. 

While Yahoo was the default weather app until Apple launched iOS 8, at which point it was replaced by the Weather Channel. 

Apple also replaced Google Maps with its own proprietary service, and stopped pre-installing Google-owned YouTube on devices. 

Within Apple Maps, local searches are made using services such as Yelp. 

The reports follow an announcement from Firefox last week that it is ditching Google as its default search engine. From the start of December, people using the browser in the US will be switched to Yahoo as the default service. Mozilla said the UK will remain unaffected, for the time being

Back in 2010, analysts at Piper Jaffray claimed there was a 70 per cent chance Apple would launch its own mobile search engine by 2015, and the impending end of the Google and Apple deal has bolstered these claims.

After a decade, Mozilla announced last week it is ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches.

From the start of December, people using the browser in the US will be switched to Yahoo.

In Russia, Firefox will start using local search engine Yandex, and Baidu will continue to be the default search engine in China.

Mozilla said the UK will remain unaffected, for the time being. 

Firefox is an open-source browser that was launched by California-based Mozilla in 2002.

As of October 2014, it was the third most used web browser in the world, behind Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and Safari.

In November, Apple Insider reported that a so-called web-crawling bot had been spotted on Apple's servers. 

This could be the start of developing its own search engine, but may also simply be used to boost its local and built-in search options. 

For example, OS X Yosemite's Spotlight Search tool scours the desktop, but also the web, maps and Wikipedia.

In 2013, Re/code reported Yahoo was 'aggressively' working to increase revenue and the focus was to become the default on Apple products. 

Firefox signed a deal with Yahoo last week to replace Google as the default search option - although users can revert back in Settings. 

Five years ago, Yahoo signed a deal with Microsoft to have Bing to carry out behind-the-scenes indexing of online content.

Yahoo and Microsoft agreed to split ad revenue under terms of the 10-year search deal, which let Yahoo focus on customising query results for users.

Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer has repeatedly stressed that Yahoo remains devoted to the search market that the company pioneered, but which Google eventually dominated.

Even if Apple does replace Google as its default engine, users are expected to be able to revert back, or select an alternative in the browser's settings. 

Google told MailOnline is doesn't comment on speculation. Apple has not replied to MailOnline's request for information.
