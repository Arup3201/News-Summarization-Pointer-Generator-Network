Chilly winter weather is finally on its way as temperatures are set to drop next week - and we could even see the first snow of the winter.

Forecasters are predicting that the higher grounds in Scotland could get a dusting of snow on Monday night, as temperatures plummet to those typical for December.

It follows a balmy November and a year of unusual weather, with this autumn on track to be the third warmest since records began. 

Temperatures dipped to as low as -1C in parts of the country overnight, with frost and fog due to set in next week.

Highland cows in the Peak District bear the brunt of the frost, which swept in this week, and it's only set to get colder as December approaches

The coldest temperatures were recorded in Scotland where it was -1.3C in Aviemore. Much of England and Wales enjoyed a milder night, with minimum temperatures of 7 and 8C across large parts of the country. 

Bournemouth and Southampton were warmer still at around 11C at 6am today. 

However a large, frosty front will sweep over the country next week after dumping the first of the winter snow in Scotland. 

'While all the cloud maintains itself in northern parts, there are outbreaks of showery rain in the north and subsequently the temperatures are more suppressed as it pushes its way south eastwards (over England and Wales), weakening all the while,' said Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl. 

'We'll see some mist and fog developing across central and south eastern England where it'll be a dull, dull start tomorrow.

'Some fog may linger while further north it brightens up later. The colder weather won't show its hand until Monday, pushing south eastwards increasing the risk of frost.'

The weekend will be warmer than average for the time of year but temperatures will start to drop towards the December average of 6C from Monday. 

Met Office meteorologist, Greg Dewhurst, added: 'We could possibly see a little bit of snow on the highest ground of the Highlands on Monday night from incoming showers.

'Elsewhere, most places will be cold and dry and there will be some mist and fog about too.' 

Forecaster Nicola Maxey said: 'On Saturday we are looking at highs of 13C or 14C during the day, which we will see in the south of England. We may possibly even see 15C.

'In Northern Ireland we are looking at highs between 11C and 12C, 9C and 11C in the North East, and similar temperatures in Scotland.

The average temperature for November is 9C, but this weekend will see temperatures reach a milder 11C to 12C on Saturday across the UK

The cold front will start off in Scotland in early hours and move slowly down, passing South West around midnight, according to forecasters

'The average temperature for the UK in November is 9C, so we are still looking at above average temperatures.

'On Sunday we will see a slight drop in temperatures, for example London and the South will be looking at highs of 11C or 12C, and between 10C and 11C in Scotland.

'On Monday we will start to see temperatures drop throughout the UK. The average temperature for December throughout the UK is 6C, so we are still looking at above average temperatures throughout the week, so for instance we are looking at temperatures between 8C and 9C in London on Monday.

'But temperatures will drop slightly throughout the week, moving closer towards the average temperature for the month.

'However, we have an area of high pressure over the UK and we are likely to see nice weather throughout the week. We are looking at periods of sunshine in between the clouds, and we are looking at nice, dry winter days.'

'We do have a weak front that comes over the UK on Monday. It will start off in Scotland in the early hours and move slowly down through the country throughout the day, passing through to the Midlands and then it will reach the South West around midnight.

'But it is only a weak front, so its likely to be light rain we are looking at more than anything else. Other than periods of light rain, it should be fairly clear otherwise.' 

'We expect to see 121mm of rain throughout the UK in the whole of November.. But, up until November 16th, we had seen 93mm of rain, which is 77 per cent of the average monthly total.'

The Environment Agency has two flood alerts in place in the south east.  

While early statistics from the Met Office have revealed that this autumn is on track to be the third warmest on record for the UK, but rainfall is close to average.

The mean temperature between September 1 and November 25 was 10.8C, which is 1.4C above average, meaning it currently ranks behind 2006 (11.4C) and 2011 (11.3C) in the digital UK records dating back to 1910. 

The mild conditions through autumn follow on from a generally warm year overall, with all months except August having seen above average temperatures.
