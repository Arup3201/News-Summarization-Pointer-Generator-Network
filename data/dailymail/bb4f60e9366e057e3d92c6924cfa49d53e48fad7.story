When the battle was over and the points were delivered, Alan Pardew came careering down the touchline, blowing kisses and punching the air. For most of the unpredictable evening, his self-control had been impeccable, but now his inhibitions were cast aside, and it was impossible to blame him.

In Pardew’s first Premier League match as their manager, Crystal Palace had achieved the victory which had escaped them since November. And they had done it against a Spurs side which so recently buried Chelsea beneath five goals. As one who played for the club, Pardew knew precisely what it meant and how significant it might prove. Hence his Hollywood parade from dugout to tunnel.

Later, he would try to place it in a saner perspective: ‘One game … small steps … swallow doesn’t make a summer.’

How the Premier League table now looks

Here's how Puncheon won it for Palace... click here to visit Sportsmail's Match Zone

But after his consistent rejection by Geordie fans, the acclaim which erupted around Selhurst Park will be ringing in his ears for some time yet. He took some pleasure in pointing out that Newcastle owner Mike Ashley had been the first person to text his congratulations after the match. But then, after Jason Puncheon scored the late and priceless goal which lifted Palace beyond the bottom three, Pardew took pleasure in everything. For everything which could go right had gone just perfectly.

By contrast, Mauricio Pochettino was suitably subdued. Spurs had fallen short of their standards and paid a heavy price. Moreover, they had conceded a genuine penalty, then been denied an equally genuine award. He correctly identified the penalty debate as the turning point, but had the class to remark: ‘Referees have a very difficult job.’

Never a man to sell himself short, Pardew set the tone with his programme notes: ‘I’d like to thank Steve Parish and the Palace board for working so hard to get me here.’

His reception was a great deal warmer than anything he heard at St James’ Park.

Tottenham passed the ball with greater confidence and moved with purpose in those opening stages, as befits a side coming off a momentous victory. But their chances were few, the football unconvincing. To their credit, Palace also passed it neatly, revealing little of the anxiety which must have attended their efforts. Yet they conceded a gaping chance in 26 minutes, when Kyle Walker drove a low cross and, in the ensuing confusion, Christian Eriksen managed improbably to hook the shot wide from four yards out.

But an even more acceptable chance fell to Palace in 37 minutes, when the Spurs back four left Glenn Murray absurdly alone, 15 yards out. Hugo Lloris advanced, more in hope than expectation, and the flustered Murray drove the shot against the keeper’s right knee. Pardew looked fleetingly homicidal, and with some reason.

Tottenham play from firm principles, building thoughtfully and refusing to resort to the witless launch. In Benjamin Stambouli, they offer a midfielder of persistent strength and bewilderingly brilliant feet. But they could not devise a position from which Harry Kane could reveal his form.

That deficiency was remedied in 49 minutes, when Spurs demonstrated the finishing which separates the best sides from the toilers. Nacer Chadli rolled a ball to Kane 20 yards out, and form asserted itself as the striker’s low, impeccable drive brought the customary result.

‘He’s one of our own,’ sang the Tottenham contingent, and while the lead was gratefully accepted, it was barely deserved.

By now, Spurs were starting to exercise authority. Chadli was producing genuine havoc with his surging runs, yet this was not a game to take for granted, for the 69th minute yielded another improbable turn.

Joe Ledley hurried on to a short flick in the Spurs area, and the hitherto excellent Stambouli stretched to the tackle and appeared to win the ball. The referee Anthony Taylor gave the appeal an eternity of consideration, then jabbed a finger at the spot. There was pandemonium at the Palace as Dwight Gayle simply battered the penalty. By now, we were prepared for anything. And so was Pardew.,

The crucial goal was withheld until the 80th minute. Palace substitute Wilfried Zaha attacked from the left with a mazily tenacious run. His pass enjoyed a fortunate break to Puncheon on the fringe of the area, and the drive was strong and precise. Had justice prevailed, Ledley’s trip on Kane would have produced a second penalty and probable equality — both managers agreed that the claim was justified.

But we sensed that Palace would escape, that the rare and precious victory would be their reward.

And when Pardew set off down the touchline, emoting like a leading lady, we knew we were right.
