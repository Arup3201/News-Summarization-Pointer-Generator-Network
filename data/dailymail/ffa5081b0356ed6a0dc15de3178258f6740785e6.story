A farmer whose land was littered with rotting animal carcasses has been banned from keeping dogs for ten years, after his collies were found feeding on decomposing remains.

Leon Henry Smith, 62, had twice before been banned from keeping sheep or cattle due to the appalling conditions on his farm near Okehampton, Devon.

Animal welfare officers found the 13 sheepdogs feeding on a rotting pig carcass in squalid conditions in 2011, but he was given the chance to improve conditions for the dogs after the judge at Exeter Crown Court deferred sentencing.

However, Smith's case was brought back to court after Devon County Council’s Trading Standards Team and DEFRA veterinary officers found fresh evidence of neglect.

Regular visits by animal welfare 
officers, under the instruction of the court, had shown no significant 
improvements being made to the standard of the dogs' care.

Officers
advised Smith to provide fresh water, clean up their enclosure and 
concrete the area to provide a suitable dry environment, but the court 
heard they continued to be housed in appalling conditions in 
rubbish-strewn and muddy makeshift kennels with little protection from 
the weather.

Last chance: The court had deferred sentencing to allow owner Leon Smith to improve conditions for the dogs

One dog was suffering with a skin condition which Smith refused refer to a vet.

Police also discovered three dogs confined overnight in a parked van with a sheep carcass crawling with maggots. Two were locked in cramped cages without food or water.

Councillor Roger Croad, Devon County Council Cabinet Member for Communities, said: 'The court gave Mr Smith the opportunity to demonstrate that he could comply with the requirements of animal welfare legislation and achieve the necessary standards of care.

'Despite being advised by our Trading Standards Officers and local vets on how to achieve this, he has failed to do so.

'The conditions his animals were kept in fall well below acceptable welfare standards, and Mr Smith’s failure to address this left us no alternative but to bring this case back to court.

'Banning him from keeping dogs for the next ten years sends a clear message to those who do not meet basic animal welfare needs, and we will continue to take all necessary action to ensure that these acceptable standards of animal care are met.'

Fresh evidence: Officers later found dogs in cramped cages in the back of a van without food or water

The Council’s Trading Standards Team launched their initial investigation into Smith in February 2011.

Visiting his land at Meldon they found his dogs feeding on the body of a dead pig that had been left in their enclosure, while more pig carcases were found among piles of rubbish and broken machinery.

Several other carcasses were subsequently found at the site, including the remains of a dead sheep in a horse box.

Serial neglect: Smith had been banned from keeping sheep or cattle on two previous occasions

Livestock carcasses are legally required to be disposed of in an approved and safe manner to prevent the spread of disease to animals and humans.

Appearing at Exeter Crown Court in May, Smith pleaded guilty to two charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and six charges under the Animal By-Products (England) Regulations 2005.

At another hearing on November 9 he also pleaded guilty to two further animal by-products offences, relating to sheep and other carcass remains found on his land at Meldon during an inspection on 19 April 2012.

These, along with the judges concerns about Smith’s general disregard to the welfare of animals, were taken into consideration in sentencing. He was banned for ten years from keeping dogs and ordered to pay an £800 fine and £500 in costs.
