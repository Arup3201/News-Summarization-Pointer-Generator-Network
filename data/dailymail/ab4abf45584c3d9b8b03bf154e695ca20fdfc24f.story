Up to 5,000 black cab drivers blockaded London's city centre yesterday in protest against a boom in unlicensed minicabs and rickshaws as well as the hugely popular Uber smartphone app.

For the second time in three months, London's famous black cabs choked Trafalgar Square and Whitehall - honking their horns as they crawled along the capital's streets.

The drivers want taxi licensing laws to be enforced and claim the taxi service app, Uber, is taking a large percentage of the market while unburdened by the regulatory costs black cabs are subject to.

The drivers were holding a mass slow-driving demonstration on Whitehall in anger at what they perceive is a lax attitude from the authorities towards unlicensed taxis on the streets of the UK capital

There are around 25,000 licensed black taxis in London, the only ones which can be legally hailed in the street. But unlicensed cabs, operated for cash by private individuals, are widely available in busy spots at night

A protest was also held in June in cities around the world, including London, against the US company, which uses freelance drivers with GPS-enabled smartphones to link up with passengers. 

The company has expanded globally into more than 100 cities in 36 countries and is considered such a growing force that some of Silicon Valley's biggest investors have ploughed money into it.

The company is currently valued at around £11 billion.

Yesterday, the general secretary of The London Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA), who organised the protest slammed Uber. 

He called it a 'massive American monster that uses its financial muscle and army of lawyers to threaten, cajole and kowtow licensing authorities and regulators', City AM reports.

Yesterday, drivers were also seen venting their anger at London's mayor, Boris Johnson, they unveiled a giant blow-up rat representing the his approach to the issue.

'Apparently, we're iconic to London, which we are. We should be looked after,' said John O'Sullivan, 40, in his taxi on The Mall, the processional route from Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square. 

There are around 25,000 licensed black taxis in London, which can be hailed in the street, and 60,000 licensed private hire vehicles, which can be pre-booked but not flagged down.

But unlicensed cabs, operated by private individuals out to make a few extra pounds, are widely available in busy spots at night. They are far cheaper than black cabs, whose cost rises into double figures for even short trips.

'We've been asking them for a long time for greater enforcement against illegal minicabs, touting,' said Mr McNamara.

'Every night of the week in London, there are people being attacked, robbed, assaulted by unlicensed, uninsured minicab drivers,' he told AFP.

'The problem in recent years has bloomed. It's now completely out of control at night in the West End,' the city's entertainment district.

Knowledgeable: Licensed London black cab drivers, dubbed the 'eyes and ears' of the city, spend three years on a moped learning 'The Knowledge' - every street in London and routes across it.

Besides unregulated drivers, cabbies also hit out at the pedal rickshaws 'clogging up' central London and 'ripping off' tourists.

Licensed London black cab drivers, dubbed the 'eyes and ears' of the city, spend three years on a moped learning 'The Knowledge' - every street in London and routes across it.

'You can't ride a moped around London for three years without falling in love with the place,' said Mr McNamara.

'When you know every inch of it as we do, this is the greatest city on Earth and it's being managed by people who wouldn't be allowed to run some third-world backwater,' he said.

The giant rat was placed next to the statue of king Charles I - to which all road distances to London are measured. Bemused tourists posed for photographs as cabbies slowly drove past.

Bob Limerick, 58, a cab driver of 15 years, said: 'We just want the law enforced. Simple as that.'

O'Sullivan said: 'We go through years and years of doing The Knowledge, which is not easy, and then it seems like we're being shafted by TfL (Transport for London).'

Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director for surface transport, said the protest was regrettable.

'The taxi trade has several forums with TfL and the mayor. We urge them to communicate directly with us on the specific issues they wish to discuss,' he said.
