It began as a distraction in a hobbyist’s basement, but the world’s biggest model railroad is now anything but. Here's a look inside the world's largest model railroad.

It boasts more than eight miles of track and features more than 100 trains, as well as almost 400 bridges and took some 16 years to complete.

Northlandz, in Flemington, New Jersey, is scaled down but its anything but small-scale. The spectacle contains more than 3,000 miniature buildings in cities and villages, 50,000 trees and 40-foot bridges spanning huge canyons.

LIfe's work: It took creator Bruce Williams Zaccagnino 16 years to finally bring his dream of Northlandz--the world's biggest model railroad--to life

It is the brainchild of owner and creator Bruce Williams Zaccagnino, who not only built the 52,000 sq ft building in which it is housed but also painstakingly designed and handcrafted almost all of the uncannily lifelike scenery.

'There's nothing like it,' he said. 'Visitors come out saying it's one of the Wonders of the World.'

Or at least one of the wonders of the Northeast Corridor.

Bruce loved model trains as a kid but it wasn't until he was married that he started to build models in his basement. His hobby got so out of control he then added five extra basements to his home to house his collection until he finally raised the money to create Northlandz.

He says he has sunk 'several million' dollars into the project, which has been open to the public since 1997.

'I worked 18 or 19 hours a day, seven days a week, non-stop,' Bruce said.

He said the attraction is recognized by Guinness World Records as the biggest of its kind on the planet.

Ex-SPAN-sive: Forty-foot bridges span 30-foot canyons in Northlandz

Altitude: The tallest peaks in Northlandz clock in around 30 feet

Serpentine: 50,000 feet, or 8 miles of track, wind around Northlandz

Perspective: Northlandz' many spans are even more impressive when viewed from below

It has even attracted several celebrity visitors - including famed model railroad fan, rocker Rod Stewart, and Neil Young, who went to the attraction in disguise.

'We didn't even know he was there until the next day,' said Bruce.

Stewart and other stars signed a special 'celebrity wall' inside the exhibit.

The path through the exhibit - spread across 16 acres - is almost one mile long.

Intricate: Northlandz, like any self-respecting town, has a theme park complete with roller coaster and other rides

People: There are lots of mini-people in Northlandz and they depend on the trains

Visitors are told at the beginning it will take at least two hours to make their way through the whole thing.

And as astounding as his Northlandz is, Zaccagnino isn’t the only train enthusiast dedicated enough to single-handedly create a locomotive tourist attraction.

Just this past weekend, Elaine Silets of the Greater Chicago area opened up her personal 10 acres of model train-filled estate gardens. She does so once a year as a charity event and this time around she greeted about 6,000 visitors.

Evolving: Zaccagnino began Northlandz some 35 years ago. It started in his basement and eventually moved to its own building where it continues to evolve
