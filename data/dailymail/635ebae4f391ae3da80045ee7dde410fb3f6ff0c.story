Marc Marquez has won the 2014 MotoGP world title for the second year in a row after his second-place finish in the Japanese Grand Prix.

The 21-year-old Spaniard stretched his championship lead over compatriot Dani Pedrosa and Italian veteran Valentino Rossi to an unassailable 82 points - with just three races of the season remaining - after finishing runner-up to Jorge Lorenzo at the Motegi circuit on Sunday.

Lorenzo finished 1.638seconds ahead of Honda's Marquez, who overtook several riders before passing, and then holding off, Rossi midway through the race.

Six-time MotoGP champion Rossi claimed the final podium place on his Yamaha but the day belonged to Marquez as he retained his title in emphatic style.

Marquez, who became the first person since Kenny Roberts in 1978 to accomplish the premier class title in his first season last year, is now the youngest back-to-back champion.

Despite working his way up after starting fourth on the grid, Marquez was unable to catch Yamaha's Lorenzo, who claimed his second successive victory after his triumph in Aragon two weeks ago.

Nevertheless, it was a good return to form for Marquez after poor results in San Marino and Aragon in his last two outings. 

Marquez, whose title triumph was largely down to winning 11 of the first 12 grands prix, said on MotoGP's official website: 'You know, the race doesn't really matter today! Maybe I wasn't riding like always, as I felt a little different.

'It was hard to overtake and I didn't want a mistake. I had two mistakes in the last races but we got the title. It's incredible to take it at home.

'Just two years in MotoGP with two titles is incredible. Maybe for the people it looks easy because I'm always smiling, but there is a lot of pressure.

'Misano and Aragon we made some mistakes so it was important to focus here for Honda. I'm really happy with my team and family and fans, they're all pushing me. It's like a dream right now.'

Rossi - who will be battling for second place in the championship with Pedrosa, with whom he is level on points - paid tribute to Marquez.

'I had a small chance to keep the championship party open, I wanted to keep it open another race. Marc's advantage was very big, but maybe we could keep it open still,' he said.

'I tried my maximum, especially with Pedrosa behind me at the end. I had a good pace but Marquez had something a little extra so it was impossible.

'I think that Marc deserves the championship; he won a lot of races and in a lot of conditions. He doesn't make mistakes and he improved his level so congratulations to Marc.'
