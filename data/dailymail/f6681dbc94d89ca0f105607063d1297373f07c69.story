They may look like a colony of ants scurrying around, but this time-lapse video shows hundreds of thousands of people queuing for a comic book convention in Tokyo, Japan.

Comiket, otherwise known as the Comic Market is the world's largest self-published comic book fair.

Attendance totals more than half million people, so an organised system like this is essential to﻿ keep people in order and prevent crowd crushes.

Fan dedication: This time-lapse video shows half a million people queuing for Comiket, otherwise known as the Comic Market which is the world's largest self-published comic book fair held twice a year in Tokyo, Japan

Forward planning: Thousands of people can be seen filing into the space.Area hotels, trains, and bus services also make special arrangements to accommodate the large crowds

Gender bias: Since Comiket began in 1975 attendance has been predominantly female

In order to buy their favourite items thousands of people line up outside the Tokyo Big Sight 
convention centre days before the event starts.

In recent years lining up before the day 
Comiket is held  has been banned, although this has not deterred the superfans and lots of attendees wait patiently in line dressed up as their favourite characters.

Since Comiket's beginning in 1974, attendance has been predominantly female - there are four to five females for every male.

Peaks and troughs: The size of the crowd waiting alternatives throughout the day as the lunchtime lull hits the queue

Mass: Thousands of people can be seen snaking through the plaza as they edge nearer to the entrance

Planning ahead: Due to the high mass of people gathering, mobile phone companies set up temporary antennas that are usually employed when stationary antennas are out of service

To help cope with the massive influx of people in a single space mobile phone companies set up temporary 
antennas that are usually employed when stationary antennas are out of 
service.

Nearby mass transit change their operating schedule and increase service to accommodate the crowds.

Due to the popularity of the event, the official Comic Market website advises first-time attendees to arrive in the afternoon to avoid having to wait in line.

But as this video shows the queue builds up from early morning and steadily swells, before dramatically decreasing towards the later hours of the convention.

Popular: Comic Market is held twice a year; once in August, and once in December

Falling: Although there is a steady stream of people, the number is dramatically less than earlier in the day

Cleared out: Only a few people can be seen wandering across the square towards the end of the video
