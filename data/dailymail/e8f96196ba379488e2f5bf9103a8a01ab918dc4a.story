Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has been told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year

Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has been told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year.

The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was said to be 'extremely upset' when he was told he has a severe condition linked to diabetes.

Sutcliffe, who killed 13 women and tried to murder seven others between 1975 and 1980, refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. 

The killer is devastated that he may soon be unable to watch television, read books and write letters, The Sun reported.

The 68-year-old, who is serving 20 life sentences at high-security psychiatric hospital Broadmoor, told a friend: 'I am terrified and just don't know how I will spend my time.'

Sutcliffe, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, had an eye check in recent weeks following a prolonged period of poor health. 

He had a hernia operation in 2013 and has since been suffering from a debilitating cough. He has been taking medication which has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. In December he suffered an attack of angina.

The Yorkshire Ripper was told he has damaged blood vessels in his retina and that the condition of his eye has deteriorated because of his diabetic retinopathy - which can lead to blindness. 

A friend of the killer is reported to have said: 'It is playing on his mind a lot and he is very upset.'

Sutcliffe lost vision in his left eye after a fellow inmate attacked him with a pen in 1997 - an attack which also damaged his right eye.

He was attacked again in 2007 by another killer, Patrick Sureda, who stabbed him in the face with a blunt seven-inch knife.

During the attack, Sureda shouted: 'I'll teach you, you b******, for killing all those women.'

Broadmoor Hospital did not comment on Sutcliffe's condition.

It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times more than the cost of a prison cell.

The murderer will see out the rest of his life at the hospital, with a plea to move to a facility 170 miles north - in Yorkshire - rejected in December.

He wanted to be closer to his family but a senior doctor there was 'no change' in Sutcliffe's condition and that he could not be moved to a lower security 65-bed unit attached to Fieldhead Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

The move would have placed him just a few miles from where he murdered his victims.
