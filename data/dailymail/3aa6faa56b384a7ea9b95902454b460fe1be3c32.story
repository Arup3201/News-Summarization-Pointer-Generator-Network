Special treatment: The hospital where Beyonce gave birth is under investigation

Beyoncé and Jay-Z kept their daughter Blue’s birth under tight security, but now the state is looking into complaints that Lenox Hospital coddled the celebrity couple while keeping other new parents from visiting their newborns.

Days after baby Blue’s birth, the Health Department said that there had been at least two families that complained that the posh Lenox Hill Hospital gave out preferential treatment.

Though Beyoncé and her husband denied that they spent $1.3million to rent out an entire floor of the hospital, other parents said they were put on ‘lockdown’ so the celebrity couple could come and go as they pleased.

While the Health Department would not go into details, nor say who filed the complaints, parents who welcomed little ones at the hospital have been vocal about their treatment.

One complaint, spokesperson Michael Moran said, was filed anonymously, while the other was from ‘a person who read about it’ in the newspapers, he told the New York Post.

Neil Coulon, 39 - who is from the same Brooklyn neighbourhood as Jay-Z - said the stress of his wife Rosalyn delivering two 
premature girls was tripled when Beyoncé's towering bodyguards allegedly barred him from the sixth-floor 
neonatal intensive care unit.

Mr
Coulon told the News that the power couple's security allegedly cleared
a waiting room of his relatives - some who drove four and a half hours 
to the Manhattan hospital to see his newborn twin girls - and described 
the star as treating the hospital like 'an exclusive nightclub'.

'Three times they stopped me from entering or exiting the NICU and it happened once on Friday - just 
because they wanted to use the hallway,' he claimed.

It has been alleged that the couple spent
$1.3million to seal off and redecorate a wing, complete 
with bulletproof glass and ultra-tight security measures.

But a hospital spokesperson released a 
statement today, saying it was 'simply not true'.

'The family is housed in an executive suite at the 
hospital and is being billed the standard rate for those 
accommodations. 'The family does have its own security detail on 
site. However, the hospital has been and continues to be in control of 
managing all security at the facility,' the spokesperson said.

The new family headed home in a decked-out Mercedes Benz that Beyonce purchased several months ago. They were reportedly followed by a large cavalcade early Tuesday morning.

The van has hand-stitched Italian leather seats and a full bathroom – complete with toilet, sink, and shower.

Blue Ivy Carter’s new nursery is just as luxurious, with a $20,000 crib in the shape of a turn-of-the-century car.

'We have made every effort to 
ensure minimal disruption to other families experiencing the births of 
their own children over the past three days.'

Mr Coulson wants an apology from the stars. He said he was appalled at the double standard. 'I know they spent $1.3million and I'm just a contractor from Bed-Stuy but the treatment we received was not okay.

'My wife is 
just terribly upset. She had a C-section. She gave birth to twins. She 
is sore. Nobody needs this.

'This is the NICU. Nobody cares if you’re a celebrity. Nobody is 
star-gazing. They just want to see their children. To have that circus roll into town and ruin our parade was unpleasant.'

Lenox Hill’s executive director Frank
Danza told the New York Daily News on Tuesday that he ordered an 
internal probe after the complaints.

Though he said additional security 
measures were enforced because of the couple’s fame, he said that none 
of the other parents there over the weekend reported being denied access
to their children.

Facing investigation: Lenox Hill Hospital is being probed by the state Health Department and is conducting an internal investigation as well

He did confirm that additional security guards were brought in and security cameras were covered in tape.

The state department did not give a 
time frame for the investigation, though in most cases, it is a 
time-intensive procedure where doctors, nurses, and other staff are 
interviewed about the complaint at hand.

New parents? There has been speculation for weeks Beyonce had already given birth

The hospital could face a fine of up to several thousand dollars if found to have given preferential treatment, the News says.

Father, mother, and baby were whisked
away early Tuesday morning in a $1million black Mercedes van, complete 
with a shower, sink, and toilet and hand stitched Italian leather seats.

Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, was by Beyonce's side during the birth, according to E! Online.

A source told Beyoncé's hometown newspaper Houston Chronicle that 'mother and baby are doing fine'.

The baby's middle name Ivy may be in reference to Beyoncé and Jay-Z's love of the number 4.

They married on April 4, 2008, Beyoncé's latest album is called 4 and the couple have matching tattoos of the roman numeral for 4 - IV - on their wedding fingers.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z were also born on September 4 and December 4 respectively.

Regarding
Blue, Jay-Z has a trilogy of albums with the word in the title. The 
Blueprint was released in 2001 around the time he got together with Beyoncé, The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse came out in 2002 and The 
Blueprint 3 in 2009.
