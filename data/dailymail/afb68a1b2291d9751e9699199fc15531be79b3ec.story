The three children of  Robin Williams do not want to get dragged into a legal battle over the estate of their late father.

Zak, 31, Zelda, 25, and Cody, 22 made a statement to NBC News through attorney Allan Mayer in regards to the battle with the late comedian's widow Susan Schneider over his personal possessions.

The statement began: 'Robin's children want nothing more than to be left alone to grieve.

'The fact is that they have been barred from what had been their father's house, and not even the trustees of the Robin Williams Trust have been able to conduct a complete inventory.'

Lawsuit: Robin Williams' widow Susan Schneider (pictured here in November 2009) is fighting his three children over personal property left in the late comedian's will, according to reports

On Monday it was reported by TMZ that Schneider and Williams' children have filed opposing court documents in a bitter legal dispute over his estate.

Schneider has complained in the documents that, in the days after Williams' suicide last August, someone entered their California home and removed belongings that she felt entitled to.

And once she started legal proceedings, 'certain home-related services were canceled', including a newspaper delivery, she said in the documents, which were filed in December and January, according to The New York Times.

In their statement through their attorney Mayer, the children of the Mrs. Doubtfire actor responded to these claims: 'The insinuation that they or their representatives may have taken anything from the house is both despicable and wholly untrue.' 

They have also accused Schneider of attempting to 'money grab' and ignore the 'plain language of his will and trust', TMZ reported.

His children acknowledge Schneider has the right to keep items that she accumulated during her marriage, but believe she is trying to alter some of the terms listed in the will.

Sources say his children believe Schneider is trying to 'redefine' aspects of the will to suit her, despite Williams being clear in his will that he left behind most of his property to his children.

According to the site, they claim she is trying to 'redefine the word jewelry' so that she can keep his watch collection, which the children say they are entitled to. 

Some of the items left to the three children also include his 1998 Oscar for the movie Good Will Hunting, as well as other memorabilia from his films. 

Williams, 63, was found dead in the $7 million home in Tiburon, Marin Country, that he shared with Schneider in August.

After two failed marriages, which reportedly cost him $30 million, Williams ensured that he and his third wife Schneider signed a prenup agreement. 

The report in The New York Times revealed that Schneider's papers assert as she lost 'her husband through a shocking and emotionally charged event,' she had not been 'given time to grieve her loss free from the frenetic efforts to interfere with her domestic tranquility'.

MailOnline has reached out for comment to representatives for the family who have so far been unavailable for comment.
