A psychic has pleaded guilty to conning an elderly bachelor out of his fortune, by using her own teenage daughter in a bogus marriage and using the proceeds to buy property, holidays and even a Ferrari with the number plate MRBIG1. 

Rachel Lee, 43, of Portland, Oregon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering as well as failing to file income tax returns.

According to court documents, Rachel Lee met Ralph Raines Jnr, 66, in 2004 and became a carer for his elderly father on their 1,200-acre timber farm in West Portland after he had a stroke. 

Rachel Lee, right, and her daughter Porsha, left, defrauded elderly bachelor Ralph Raines Jnr out of more than $12 million according to prosecutors in Portland, Oregon over a period of almost a decade

Lee became Raines Snr's primary care giver and moved in her teenage daughter Porsha Lee. 

By the time Raines Snr had died in February 2011, Lee had already begun siphoning off money from the farm's accounts. 

According to the indictment in and around 2009, Raines Jnr began claiming that he had married a woman called Mary Marks, an illegal immigrant from the UK. Court documents claim 'Marks' bore Raines Jnr a son named in court documents as the minor 'G'. 

The child belonged to another of Lee's daughters who allowed the infant to be used as part of the conspiracy.  

However, according to the indictment: 'The person who interacted with others as Jr's wife Mary Marks was Porsha Lee in disguise. 

'When posing as Mary Marks, Porsha Lee typically presented in heavy make-up, a blonde wig, glasses, hat, and a British accent.

'It is part of the conspiracy that, in approximately 2009, through material misrepresentations and omissions of material fact, that that the fictitious Mary Marks/Porsha Lee began sharing administrative control of R. Tree Farm with Rachel Lee.' 

According to Court documents, between 2006 and 2011, the Lees took control of the financial and business affairs of the Raines father and son. It was claimed that the pair 'gradually and incrementally isolated Jr and terminated meaningful contact between Jr, his business associates , his neighbours and his family.' 

Among the cars purchased by Rachel Lee was a 2012 Ferrari California convertible similar to this one 

Lee also bought a 2012 Bentley Mulsane with the proceeds from her complicated wire fraud, file photograph 

The fraudsters also bought a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air from a classic car dealership, file photograph 

Acting as Raines' wife, Porsha Lee negotiated the sale of at least four parcels of property for millions of dollars with the proceeds from the sales went into bank accounts controlled by Rachel Lee.

Rachel Lee and her boyfriend spent the cash on travel and luxury cars, according to the indictment. A 2012 Bentley had the license plate "MRBIG." The license plate for a 2012 Ferrari was "MRBIG1."

Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna Maddux declined to comment about the case until after sentencing on Jan. 20. A plea agreement states that Rachel Lee will spend seven to nine years in prison.

"The public documents speak for themselves," Maddux said.

A court record says Porsha Lee, 24, has also accepted a plea agreement. 

According to court documents, the Rachel Lee bought a white convertible 2012 Ferrari California with the vanity plate MRBIG1. She also bought a 2012 Bentley Mulsane with MRBIG and a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air. Lee also had a 2012 Mercedes 550.  

Prosecutors believe that Porsha Lee, posing as Raines Jnr's wife Mary Marks sold at least four parcels of land for a combined total of $12.3 million with the majority of the proceeds lodged in accounts controlled by Rachel Lee. 

Investigator discovered that Rachel Lee and her boyfriend Blancey Lee used the proceeds to take frequent trips to California and Las Vegas, including luxury stays in the Bellagio, The Venetian and The Wynn.
