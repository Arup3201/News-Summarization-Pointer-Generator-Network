During pregnancy, finding ordinary clothes that look good can be hard enough. And as for fancy dress, well – that’s a whole different challenge.

But Zara Phillips seemed to manage admirably as she attended the Goodwood Revival Festival yesterday.

Miss Phillips, who is five months pregnant, wore a 1920s-style monochrome dress for the event, which celebrates vintage vehicles.

Maternity chic: Zara with husband Mike and pilot Tracey Curtis-Taylor next to the Spirit of Artemis

Challenge: Zara wishes the pilot luck as she prepares to fly the Boeing Steerman plane 7000 miles from Cape Town in South Africa to Goodwood

Dressing up: Mike also got into the spirit of the day in a vintage uniform

The Queen's granddaughter, 32, was joined by her rugby player husband Mike Tindall, 34, at the annual event.

Zara channeled the Sixties with a monochrome
dress and matching cardigan with sheer black tights and pumps. She 
accessorised her look with a chic cloche hat and a string of Audrey Hepburn-style pearls.

Her husband also got into the spirit of the day by donning a vintage pilot uniform.

He met a real high-flyer when Zara, 32, and he were introduced to pilot Tracey Curtis-Taylor next to a Spirit of Artemis plane.

Typical British weather: Rain didn't dampen the day as Zara kept dry under an umbrella

High-flier: Ms Curtis-Taylor plans to recreate the same flight Lady Mary Heath took in 1928

At Goodwood Revival, all things vintage are celebrated, from fashion and make up to racing and music

The pilot, who is experienced in flying vintage planes, will fly the Boeing Steerman
plane 7000 miles from Cape Town in South Africa to Goodwood from November 1, recreating the pioneering journey of Lady Mary Heath in 1928.

Aviation and motor car enthusiasts head to the Goodwood Revival Festival every year to celebrate the golden age of motor racing.

The three-day event celebrates the 40s, 50s, and 60s and, like Zara and Mike, many visitors embrace the opportunity to dress up in vintage clothing.
