A man used his 'passing' relationship with footballer Ashley Cole to tempt two jewellers to a hotel with bags full of diamonds and watches before robbing them, a court has heard.

Barry 'Junior' Eaton, 33, is accused of telling Dean Magri and Christopher Agathocleous that Chelsea footballer Cole wanted to meet them at the Verta Hotel in Battersea to buy luxury jewellery on January 29.

However, when the two men arrived at the hotel Cole failed to appear. They then went outside, where Eaton, along with his friend Raphael Francis, 23, allegedly beat and robbed them.

The men were wearing balaclavas and brandishing a fake handgun. Francis was arrested by police officers at the scene, while Eaton was taken in for questioning the day after and later charged.

Mr Agathocleous's blue leather Hugo Boss bag, containing Rolex diamond bracelets, several loose diamonds, a Casio diamond watch, diamond rings, diamond earrings and a diamond pendant was recovered.

However Magri's bag, containing six designer watches worth £110,000, was never found.

According to the prosecution, Eaton discussed the possibility of buying jewellery with Cole's 'gatekeeper' but was told the footballer wasn't interested

Opening the case at Kingston Crown Court, prosecutor Luke Ponte said: 'These two men thought they were going to meet a new customer. They thought they were going to meet a very valuable new customer.

'They thought they were going to meet Ashley Cole - who most of you will know as the England and Chelsea footballer, and the rest if you will know as Cheryl's ex.

'They thought they were going to meet him to sell some jewellery because Mr Eaton, in the dock, knew Mr Cole and told them might be in the market for some jewellery.

'But they weren’t going to meet Ashley Cole. They were going to be assaulted and robbed by young men with covered faces, one of whom produced what looked like a handgun.

'The Crown says that Mr Eaton set up the robbery and Mr Francis was one of the robbers.'

The court heard Eaton had contacted Cole’s ‘gatekeeper’ Mohammed Ayub about some expensive gems weeks before the robbery.

Mr Ponte said: 'Police spoke to Mohammed Ayub, who works as a driver and personal assistant for Ashley Cole.

'You will hear from Mr Ayub that one of the crosses that professional footballers bear, along with a weekly £250,000 salary, is that all sorts of people pester them for all sorts of reasons.

'It is sensible to have some sort of gatekeeper, and for Ashley Cole it is Mr Ayub. If you want to get to Ashley, you go through him first.

'He will tell you that he has known Mr Eaton for two years. He sees him at clubs and occasionally chats to him on the phone or has Blackberry conversations with him.

'He remembers Mr Eaton mentioning, around three weeks before the robbery, he had a contact that could show Ashley Cole some jewellery.

Mr Magri worked for Farringdon's (left), while Mr Agathocleous had no shop and loaned his items from other jewellers. The men travelled to the Verta Hotel in Battersea (right) where they expected to meet Ashley Cole

'He told Mr Eaton that Ashley has his own jewellery designer and didn’t think he would be interested.

'Mr Ayub did not arrange any meeting with Mr Eaton nor has he ever seen any photos of jewellery sent by Mr Eaton.'

The court heard Mr Agathocleous, a friend of Eaton, caters for high end clientele and that Mr Magri specialised in expensive watches.

He said: 'Mr Margi works at Hatton Cross Jewellers called Farringdons. He specialised in high-end watches. He and Mr Agathocleous had been friends for five years.

'Mr Agathocleous is also a friend of Barry Eaton. Like most people, he knew Mr Eaton by his nickname ‘Junior.’

'Mr Margi had never met Mr Eaton before the night of the meeting.'

Mr Ponte added that Mr Agathocleous loaned the items he brought from other jewellers and was not insured.

Eaton and Francis, both from Norwood, South London, deny two counts of robbery and one count of having an imitation fire arm.

Francis is also denies actual bodily harm on a police officer.

The trial, which is expected to take a week, continues.
