Telmo Zarra, the holder of the all-time La Liga goalscoring record who sadly passed away in 2006, would have wanted Lionel Messi to surpass him, says the legend's daughter.

Zarra scored 251 league goals for Athletic Bilbao between 1940 - 1955, but could soon see his record broken by the Argentine phenomenon who has netted 249 times for Barcelona.

Carmen Zarra claims that her father would have loved Messi not only for his obvious talent but for the way he conducts himself on and off the pitch.

Alfredo Di Stefano        227

Speaking to Catalunya radio, she said: 'My father would have liked Messi to beat his record. We love Athletic in my house, but I'm sure that my father would have loved Messi, because he seems to be a very noble person both on and off the pitch. His behaviour is exemplary.'

Zarra's daughter discussed comparisons between Messi and his Real Madrid nemesis Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 190 league goals himself.  

'Give me Messi every day. I much prefer Messi as a player and as a person, without wanting to go into any further details. 

'I don't want to say any more. I prefer how he behaves on the pitch. I see Messi playing on the pitch and I like to follow him. Cristiano Ronaldo is dangerous in front of goal, he's very strong, and he's to be feared, but in terms of who I like, I like Leo more'.

Zarra went on to say that the prospect of losing the record does not sadden her family, although she would have preferred an Athletic player to break it

'We aren't angry, not at all. The record has to be beaten one day. My dad hung up his boots in the 53-54 season,' she said,

'Almost 60 years have passed since then. It's time for someone to beat the record. I won't lie to you though, I would have loved an Athletic player to do it'.
