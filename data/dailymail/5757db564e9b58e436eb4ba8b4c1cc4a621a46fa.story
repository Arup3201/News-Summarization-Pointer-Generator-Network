Laura Robson took a further step in her recovery from wrist surgery as the cast was removed from her arm on Monday.

The 20-year-old Brit will miss Wimbledon this summer after taking the decision to have surgery on her troublesome left wrist in April.

And Robson was left shocked by the condition of her skin after removing the cast.

Shocked: Robson tweeted her thoughts after having her cast removed on Monday

Robson 
tweeted: 'I've seen some gross things in my time but nothing could 
prepare me for what my skin looked like after 6 weeks in a cast.'

It is still unclear when Robson will return to the tour, with wrist injuries often taking many months to overcome.

Robson
 had reached a career-high of No 27 last July but has dropped to a 
current position of No 83 after not playing since a first-round exit at 
the Australian Open in January.

Last match: Robson last played in the January's Australian Open, where she suffered a first-round exit

On the grass: Robson, who reached the fourth round last year, will miss Wimbledon later this month
