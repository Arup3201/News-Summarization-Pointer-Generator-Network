As Valentine's approaches couples express affection to their loved ones in a variety of ways - including one man who takes back-facing portraits of his wife.

Self-taught photographer and Economics Professor Fabio Sabatini and his wife Alessandra Gualtieri travel the world, visiting European countries Greece and Spain, as well as Asian countries, like Bali and Thailand; Sabatini shoots Alessandra when she's gazing at the amazing sights.

While Alessandra is looking in awe at the historic sites or the breathtaking views, unbeknown to her, Fabio is taking her picture from behind creating a powerful, faceless image.

Highlights include Alessandra throwing her hands up in delight when she spots a blossom tree in bloom, relaxing and taking in the view while visiting Patmo in Greece and walking in the bustling city of Paris.

The couple, who live in Rome started the series titled shoulders in December 2009 in Galicia in Spain.

Sabatini visually expresses his love for his wife, giving viewers a glimpse in to his life.

Fabio said: 'Initially, my purpose was to represent the melancholic mood we share most of the time. So I realised how powerful a faceless, sometimes mysterious, portrait can be.

'It is much more interesting and challenging to represent a complex set of feelings by framing the model's hair and shoulders in a proper - suggestive, dreamy or even scary and nightmarish - background, instead of simply and plainly picturing her expression.

'This also leads the watcher to actively focus on what the photo makes her/him feel - and possibly to imagine what the photographer's and the model's feelings may have been - instead of passively admire or dislike the final result of the photographer's work - just as straight portraits usually do.'
