Kelly Billen was branded a 'manipulative deviant' after she ransacked the home of her  neighbour, 94, and stole £20,000 worth of his premium bonds

A woman spent four days ransacking the home of her elderly neighbour, ripping up floorboards to steal his valuables and eventually cashing in his life savings of almost £20,000.

Kelly Billen, 35, devastated the home of 94-year-old Richard Jones near Aberdare in south Wales, overturning furniture and lifting attic insulation to find anything she could possibly steal.

The pensioner had been away for just four days when his niece went to check on the house and found all the rooms had been searched, furniture overturned and the house plundered. 

It emerged Billen had raided the house, eventually finding paperwork for Mr Jones' life savings in premium bonds for £19,426 which she managed to cash in.

However she was caught after she left a footprint at the scene, traced back to one of her trainers. 

Police have branded Billen, who used to work in a care home, a 'manipulative deviant.'

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Jones’s niece visited his home to check on the property and left in “disbelief because there was such a mess”.

Mr Jones has dementia and is now living in a care home, unaware of what happened at his home.

Ian Kolvin, prosecuting Billen, said: 'The house was ransacked. All the rooms had been searched.

'All the property had been turned upside down and even the insulation in the attic had been pulled up.'

However Billen was tracked down after she left a footprint at the scene in Hirwaun and was identified by tests on her Nike trainer.

Mr Jones's financial documents were found in her shed.

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard she tried to register for online banking at Nationwide and the Principality building society to access his accounts.

She also tried to cash a £1,100 cheque at Lloyds but was turned away.

Lucy Crowther, defending, said Billen had been a care worker but had increasing debts after turning to amphetamines.

At a hearing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court Billen was jailed for three years and three months for burglary 

Billen was jailed for three years and three months after admitting burglary and eight counts of fraud. 

Recorder Richard Booth QC said: 'When you got hold of the documents you got busy with a view of obtaining money for drugs.'

Detective Constable Gareth Millard later said: 'This was a callous and calculated crime which could very easily have drained this innocent, vulnerable man of his life savings.

'She deserves her time in prison and for people to know exactly what a manipulative deviant she is.'
