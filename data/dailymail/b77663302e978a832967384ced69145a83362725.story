Daniel Sturridge insists England must not get obsessed with Luis Suarez ahead of the Three Lions' clash with Uruguay on Thursday.

The striker revealed he has not spoken to his Liverpool team-mate during the tournament and that the pair have not asked each other for 'clues' ahead of the crunch Group D clash.

After missing his side's 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica on Friday, Suarez could be fit to feature against Roy Hodgson's men.

However, Sturridge insists he and his fellow Reds in the England squad have not been in contact with their Anfield team-mate and said: 'I'm not on texting terms with Luis Suarez right now, we can't have an obsession with him. I don't suppose Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson or Glen Johnson are either.

'He hasn't asked me for any clues and I haven't asked him. Whether they have Luis or not, we'll play the same.'

‘He’s a world-class player, but we’re facing Uruguay, with Cavani, Forlan - a legend - other players who are very technically gifted and can do a lot of things on a football field.

‘We’re worrying about them as a team, not just about Luis.’

Sturridge also revealed his mother Grace told him to 'mash it up, son' when he spoke to her on the phone before England took on Italy in their opening Group D game.

She celebrated her birthday hours after England's 2-1 loss, in which Sturridge scored in the 37th minute.

Sturridge, who posted a photo to his Instagram account of himself and Danny Welbeck posing with Brazilian fans in Rio on Monday, said of England's clash with Uruguay next Thursday: 'This is the kind of game where little kids want to miss school to get home to watch it.

Meanwhile frontman Welbeck insists his Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney will have no problem performing for England against Uruguay even if he is deployed out on the left once more.

Rooney, who set up Sturridge to score from close-range during Saturday's defeat, was forced to start out on the left with Raheem Sterling preferred in his usual No 10 role.

However, Welbeck insists England's talisman is experienced enough to deal with being played out of position and said: 'Of course he gets frustrated when he is not playing in his favoured position. But he is experienced and can cope with it.'
