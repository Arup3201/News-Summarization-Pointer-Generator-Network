A player is only considered a World Cup winner if he made an appearance in a winning campaign.

There will have been plenty of Arsenal fans cheering on Germany on Sunday evening, attempting to share in the triumph of a World Cup win that seems to edge further away from England's dreams.

And rightly so, as the Gunners can now boast more World Cup winners than any other English club after Germany's dramatic 1-0 victory at the Maracana.

German trio Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Per Mertesacker doubled Arsenal's winners' tally to six, overtaking Manchester United and West Ham.

Arsenal's other three winners were Cesc Fabregas (Spain, 2010), Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit (both France, 1998).

And 200 miles north of the Emirates, Manchester City fans were looking to register their first ever World Cup winners, but Argentinian trio Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Aguero and Martin Demichelis missed out in extra-time to Mario Gotze's winner.

Two European powerhouses lead the way in the overall winners' tally; Juventus on 22 and Bayern Munich, now on 21, after seven of their stars took home a medal on Sunday night.

Inter Milan trail with 18 and Roma continue the Italian dominance with 13, with the Azzurri having won the World Cup four times - in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006 - with heavy Italian-based squads.When it comes to divisions, Italy and Germany triumph again.

The Italian league, now seen as behind the Premier League, La Liga and Bundesliga for entertainment and quality value, boasts 90 World Cup winners, while the German league has now leapfrogged the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A into second with 64.

The English top flight, for all its foreign imports over the past two decades and more, can only register 24 winners, seventh behind the Spanish, Uruguayan and Argentinian leagues.

Spanish failure in major competitions before the turn of the century mean two of the world's most successful clubs - Barcelona and Real Madrid - have just 18 winners between them.

West Ham, forever regarded as the team that won the World Cup for England in 1966, have as many winners associated with them as the likes of United, Borussia Dortmund, Fluminense and Monaco.But no club can boast such an impact from just three of their players on a World Cup finals.

Winning captain Bobby Moore, World Cup final hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst and final goalscorer Martin Peters were all playing at Upton Park at the time England beat West Germany 4-2 at Wembley, and the three's achievements are immortalised in a statue outside of the Hammers' ground.

England's success has starved since, and with the globalisation of the Premier League and an increasing preference for club over country, fans can support other nations if their players are represented elsewhere.

Manchester United supporters adopted Holland in anticipation of signs of a change of fortune with manager Louis van Gaal, while Aston Villa fans took some comfort in seeing Dutchman Ron Vlaar keep the world's best in his pocket. Even fans of Championship side Charlton had something to cheer about, with midfielder Reza Ghoochannejhad representing Iran.

It's not the same, but it's something.

But while some in north London were looking to the continent to claim a World Cup win of their own on Sunday evening, we'll be hoping the wait for success on our own shores isn't too far around the corner.
