Novak Djokovic had to dig deep to fend off Frenchman Gilles Simon in the second round of Cincinnati's Western & Southern Open.

Serbia's world No 1 and recently married Wimbledon champion lost to Simon's compatriot Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Toronto last week, and was in trouble after dropping the second set to Simon.

He recovered to post a 6-3 4-6 6-4 win and later said on the ATP website: 'I know I'm not playing at the level yet where I want to be and it's obvious, but I keep on pushing myself.'

Eye on the ball: Novak Djokovic had to work hard for his three-set win against Frenchman Gilles Simon 

Djokovic, afforded a first-round bye, added: 'Every day is a new challenge to try to look out for a better game tomorrow and after tomorrow, and hopefully it's going to come.'

Djokovic has a particular target this week, which is to land the title and become the first singles player to complete a career sweep of all nine World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments, the tier below grand slam level.

Earlier in the day, Tsonga had slid to a surprise first-round loss against Mikhail Youzhny, being brushed aside 6-1 6-4 by the Russian who will next face Andreas Seppi.

In the second round, third-seeded Swiss Stan Wawrinka beat Benjamin Becker 6-3 7-6 (7/5).

Ninth seed Ernests Gulbis needed two tie-breaks to beat Ivan Dodig 7-6 (10/8) 7-6 (7/4).

In the concurrent women's tournament, French Open runner-up and new world number two Simona Halep returned from a four-week break to beat Belgian Kirsten Flipkens in her opening match.

Handed a first-round bye, Romanian Halep was a 6-4 6-2 winner against Flipkens.

Former top-ranked Danish player Caroline Wozniacki beat China's Zhang Shuai 6-2 6-3 to join Halep in the third round.

Defending champion Victoria Azarenka pulled out on Tuesday because of a knee injury, while Russian fifth seed Maria Sharapova advanced to the third round with a 6-1 3-6 6-3 win over American Madison Keys.

In first-round action, veteran home favourite Venus Williams saw her campaign ended as she lost 6-7 (2/7) 6-3 6-4 to Czech 16th seed Lucie Safarova - a significant comedown from Williams' run to the final in Montreal last week.

Andy Murray plays his second round match against Joao Sousa on Wednesday afternoon, and will hope to build on reaching the quarter-final in last week's Toronto tournament.

Drought: Andy Murray has not won a title in over a year, and will be desperate to end that run this week
