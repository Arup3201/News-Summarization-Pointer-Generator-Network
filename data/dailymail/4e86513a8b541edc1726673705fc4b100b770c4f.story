Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's re-election campaign risked a Scrooge image last week with a Black Friday promotion asking parents to make campaign contributions instead of buying their children Christmas presents.

'Instead of electronics or toys that will
 undoubtedly be outdated, broken, or lost by the next Holiday Season,' a Walker re-election campaign email instructed, 'help give your children the gift of a Wisconsin that we can all be proud
 of.' 

It was 'a Black Friday special that is better than any deal 
found in stores,' the campaign claimed: 'Donate $5, $10 or $25 to help Governor Walker get 
reelected and save your children from a future of double-digit tax 
increases and billion dollar budget deficits.'

Walker is riding a wave of popularity in his home state that has political wags speculating about a presidential run in 2016.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's re-election campaign asked moms and dads to raid their children's Christmas gift funds for political contributions

Walker's deputy campaign finance director claimed Wisconsin children would be better off with a Republican governor than with 'electronics or toys' on Christmas Day

Taylor Palmisano, who has served as the campaign's deputy finance director since July, signed the email. She did not respond to requests for comment.

The liberal blog Cognitive Dissonance first published the fundraising solicitation. It compared the effort to news reports about a Cleveland, Ohio Wal-Mart that asked its employees for food donations to benefit their lower-income coworkers, and a union-driven publicity stunt that advised low-wage McDonald's employees to return their Christmas gifts and pay off their debts instead.

But another political campaign pioneered the tactic last year.

Obama For America, the president's re-election campaign, introduced its Obama Gift Registry in June 2012. The organization asked Democratic voters to 'register with Obama 2012, and ask for a donation in lieu of a gift' for their birthdays, bar or bat mitzvahs, weddings and anniversaries.

'Instead of another gift card you’ll forget to use,' the campaign wrote on Obama's trailblazing e-commerce website, 'ask your friends and family for something that will go a little further: a donation to Obama for America.'

Real: The president's 2012 re-election campaign asked supporters to decline birthday, wedding and anniversary gifts, and send Barack Obama the proceeds instead

Spoof: Conservatives mocked the Obama team in 2012 by circulating a fake campaign announcement asking Obama voters to opt for cremation instead of burial when they die ? and send the savings to the president's campaign

Not real: Anti-Obama forces responded in 2012 with a plea for expectant parents to name their kids 'Barack' or 'Michelle' -- and make a symbolic donation, in the tyke's name, of course

Obama's campaign organization was renamed 'Organizing For Action' in 2013, and still hosts the fundraising stunt on its website. The urban legend-debunking website Snopes confirmed in July 2012 that the Obama effort was the real thing.

Conservatives were quick to mock it at the time, spoofing the Obama Gift Registry with a series of parodies that quickly went viral.

One, an Obama Cremation Registry, appeared to ask Obama supporters to opt for cremation instead of a more expensive burial or their dearly departed loved ones – and send the savings to the Obama campaign.

'Your loved ones will thank you – from the grave,' the comedic piece joked.

Another conservative skewering was a fictitious Obama Baby Name registry, asking expectant parents to name their new children 'Barack' or 'Michelle,' mark the occasion with a $100 donation to the president's campaign, and enter a drawing for $1,000.

'Your decision to terminate a pregnancy before the election does NOT affect your odds of winning the grand prize,' snarked the lampoon's authors.

The fundraising email was signed by campaign deputy finance director Taylor Palmisano (L). Walker hopes to beat back a challenge from Democrat Mary Burke (R), a former mountain bike company executive

Gov. Walker's most likely Democratic opponent in 2014 has attracted her own share of scorn.

Former Trek bicycle company executive Mary Burke got a PR black eye in November when the U.S. Department of Labor ruled that as many as 20 former Trek employees were eligible for federal aid because the company eliminated their jobs by outsourcing more of its work to China.

Walker swept into power, and survived a union-bankrolled recall effort, on the strength of labor policies that Democrats opposed bitterly. The state's Republican Party has come down on the side of businesses that choose to outsource jobs to save money.

The governor has made some pundits' short-lists of potential GOP presidential candidates, claiming during a book tour that the White House's next occupant should be a governor, not a member of Congress..

'It’s got to be somebody who’s viewed as being exceptionally removed from Washington,' he told ABC News, adding that 'I don’t rule anything out' when it comes to his future political aspirations.
