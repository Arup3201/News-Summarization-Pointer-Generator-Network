When alleged drug dealer and jazz saxophonist, Robert Vineberg was arrested in February, 2014, accused of selling 73 bags of heroin – the last deadly hit -- to the Oscar-winning actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman, there was no question who Vineberg’s lawyer was going to call: bail bondsman to the stars Ira Judelson.   

Vineberg had been sent to Rikers Island prison where he sat for two weeks, sleepless and sick while kicking his heroin habit.

Bail was set at $200,000--over $40,000 cash--for the musician who got out of jail when Judelson, known as The Fixer, posted his bond. Vineberg faces three felony charges that could deliver 25 years behind bars as well as deportation back to Canada where he grew up.

Before the fall: Revered actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's lifeless body was found in his Manhattan apartment on February 2 with envelopes branded 'Ace of Spades' brand heroin

Out on bail: Thanks to The Fixer Ira Judelson, accused heroin dealer in the Hoffman case Robert Vineberg was released after rotting in jail for two weeks

But for now at least, he’s free.

Whether it’s a celebrity, a mobster, an athlete, a drug dealer or the ‘millionaire’ madam Anna Gristina, in New York Judelson’s phone number is the one to have in your black book.

He knows how to rattle the cages of judges, lawyers and cops to bail his celebrity and common criminal clients out of big jams and out of jail.

With a client list including New York Giants football players Plaxico Burress and Lawrence Taylor, rappers Ol’Dirty Bastard, Ja Rule, Lil’ Wayne and DMX, notorious Manhattan madam Kristin Davis, and former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Judelson is the macher—a schemer with many plans--he writes in his upcoming book, The Fixer, soon to be published by Simon & Schuster.

‘I don’t chase bad guys. They mostly come to me because I lend them money at a rate. It’s not exactly free. I’m like a legal loan shark’, Judelson writes.

Was he wearing his Calvins? Judelson was called to bail out Calvin Klein's ex-lover, Nick Gruber, when the former erotic model was busted in April 2012 on a drug charge--hiding cocaine in his underwear

When good guys or bad guys, mob guys or white collar guys are caught doing something illegal, they’re in the system and usually need to put up their house, business or property as a guarantee they won’t skip town on their bail.

That has to be done through a licensed bondsman who gets a percentage of the bond. If the client does a runner, the bondsman loses his fee and could be responsible for the full amount of the bail. The fee in New York is a 6-8-10 percent structure; the higher the bail the lower the percentage.

‘It’s like a blood oath, because if you f*** with me, you f*** with my living. You f*** with my family’, the author says. ‘I might be the only person keeping you from getting sucked up in the injustice system. I know who to touch for a favor to make sure your time inside goes easy, which judges might let you slide and which ones have zero tolerance.

‘I have a direct line to white-shoe lawyers who’ll work pro bono… and I know the cops and the DAs who believe in second chances. So yeah…I guess I’m a macher. It’s my job to make things happen. It’s my job to get you out of jail’.

Busted: When rapper Ja Rule was arrested with Lil Wayne on gun and drug charges following a concert at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan, Ja's manager called Jedelson

Judelson, was called to bail out Calvin Klein’s ex-lover, Nick Gruber, when the former erotic model was busted in April 2012 on a drug charge--hiding cocaine in his underwear--and for beating up a pal at his West Village apartment.

Judelson posted the $10,000 bond for the porn actor who appeared in a group sex scene in the gay porn film, Next Door Buddies.

When Rapper Ja Rule was arrested with Lil Wayne in July 2007 on gun and drug charges following a concert at the Beacon Theatre in upper Manhattan. Ja’s manager called Judelson.

Ja put up his house in Jersey which was worth about $2 million, enough to cover his uncle and their limo driver, who were also pinched that night. He also worked Lil Wayne’s bond. No one spent a single night in jail.

It was the beginning of a long friendship with Ja who started sending other clients to the bondsman. Fifty Cent, Fabolous, Fat Joe – put him on their speed dial.

Biggest bond: 'But you should know. I believe in this man,' Dominique Staruss-Kahn's then wife Anne Sinclair told Judelson as she put up their Washington D.C home and cash as collateral for the massive $6 million bailout

DMX, the second rapper in history to release back-to-back #1 albums in the same year after Tupac Shakur, called Judelson when he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal impersonation, criminal mischief, driving under the influence and possession of cocaine. He was picked up racing to JFK airport with a red siren on his car – claiming to be a federal agent.

Judelson got him out the next day but DMX couldn’t stay out of trouble. He never got the career he deserved, the author writes.

The bail he wrote for Dominique Strauss-Khan, (DSK) the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was a game-changer, an ‘eye-popping, jaw-dropping $5 million,’ Judelson writes. ‘No one had ever written a $5 million bail before – not in New York, not in any other state in the country. No one, that is, but yours truly.’

Who ya gonna call: The Fixer is the moniker Ira Judelson uses to describe his unique talents. The bail bondman tells his tale in his upcoming book.

It was a wild ride, he says, back in May 2011, when Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of sexual assault and attempted rape of a chambermaid at a midtown New York City hotel. She claimed he’d forced her to have sex with him. The leading candidate for the French presidency at the time, DSK was met by police on the tarmac at JFK and taken off his Paris-bound plane.

The bond was $5 million plus $1 million in cash. DSK’s wife at the time, Anne Sinclair, a radio and television reporter, was en route from France with the cash, accompanied by two bodyguards, ex Navy SEALS.

She also put up their house in Washington, DC as collateral which satisfied the insurance company – and Judelson wrote the bond for $6 million – against the house and $3 million in cash.
