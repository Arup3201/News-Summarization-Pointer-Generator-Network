New footage has emerged of what appears to be a wheelchair-bound man walking to his chair without any apparent difficulty at a World Cup match in Brazil.

Video footage of the man was taken at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro during the match between Ecuador and France on Wednesday.

It comes following reports of authorities in Brazil investigating after pictures emerged of dozens of supposedly disabled fans standing up during matches.

New footage has emerged of what appears to be a wheelchair-bound man walking to his chair without any apparent difficulty at a World Cup match in Brazil

It is feared concession seats are being sold on the black market, denying those who genuinely need them.

The latest footage to emerge, which has been posted to YouTube, appears to show the man walking unaided and without any apparent difficulty towards the chair before sitting down in it.

Before the World Cup started, Fifa released cheaper tickets specifically for pensioners, students and disabled fans.

But last week the Daily Mail reported how fans have taken pictures of youths and apparently able people occupying the seats.

The photographs have been uploaded on to social media sites, where they have then been spread across the world.

Brazil supporter Andrea Dias joked: ‘The World Cup is creating miracles.’

Lawyer Sonita Hayward wrote online: ‘Bet they’re not feeling so clever now.’

It was reported last week that police in Brazil were investigating 22 CCTV images which appear to show fans who have arrived at stadiums in wheelchairs standing up during the games. Pictured is a fan apparently jumping out of a wheelchair during a World Cup match in Sao Paulo

Disabled
 spots are thought to be particularly valuable because they come with a 
free extra ticket so wheelchair-users can come with a companion.

Among
 the pictures which have been uploaded online, some were taken at the 
opening game of the tournament in Sao Paulo, between Brazil and Croatia.
