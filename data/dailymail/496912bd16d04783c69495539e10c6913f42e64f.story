MPS faced a backlash over the so-called zombie Parliament last night – after knocking off from work five hours early.

In a stark illustration of the lack of Parliamentary business during the Coalition’s dying days, they packed up after barely three hours of debate.

It meant that the MPs – who only started work at 2.30pm yesterday – were finished for the day at 5.40pm, hours ahead of the scheduled finish time of 10.30pm.

Commons doorkeepers, who are paid to guard the chamber, were heard to mutter sarcastically: ‘Well, that was a long day’ as the small band of MPs who had turned up trooped out early.

 The incident has been branded an insult to voters, who are billed the same for MPs’ pay and lavish expenses regardless of how little work they do.

And even fewer MPs are expected to turn up for the rest of the week because there is no Government business scheduled.

 Instead, they are expected to focus on electioneering to save their jobs. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg spent much of yesterday promoting campaign issues.

Andy Silvester, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the situation ‘makes a mockery’ of rules introduced by the Coalition that mean an election cannot be held until May, if MPs spend months ‘kicking their heels around Westminster’.

He added: ‘Too often we’ve seen new laws railroaded through Parliament – not least the HS2 Bill – without proper scrutiny because of an alleged lack of Parliamentary time, and these short days rub salt in the wound. This increasingly feels like a zombie Parliament seeing out its obligations, and taxpayers deserve better.’

Last week the Prime Minister rejected allegations that he was presiding over a zombie Parliament, saying that legislation being worked on includes new anti-terror laws. 

But the only Government business tabled for this week was last night’s piece of legislation to allow women bishops to be fast-tracked into the House of Lords.

Debate on the uncontroversial measure finished hours early, allowing MPs to go home. The rest of the week is dominated by Opposition debates led by the SNP and Labour, and a backbench debate on the governance of the Commons.

Last night shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Ashworth said: ‘I’m afraid what happened today just illustrates what we have been saying for some time – we have a zombie Government that has run out of steam.’

Ukip MP Mark Reckless said the main parties appeared to have cut a deal that would allow their MPs to head back to their constituencies to campaign while still on the public payroll.

He added: ‘Today we sat for three hours, and there were not many of us in for that. The focus is on saving their seats rather than serving the country.’
