Stefan Johansen admitted Celtic will be Europa League no-hopers if they don’t fix the glaring defensive flaws in last night’s 4-3 defeat from Dinamo Zagreb.

Ronny Deila’s side completed their Group D campaign with an often shambolic showing in the dead rubber in Croatia.

Errors from Adam Matthews helped Marko Pjaca bag a hat-trick, while Domagoj Antolic was also on target for Dinamo. Celtic responded with goals from Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic, plus an own goal from Josip Pivaric.

The Hoops will have to improve after a shambolic defensive performance in Croatia

The draw for the last 32 takes place on Monday but Johansen insisted Celtic will have to show vast improvement to have any chance against a superior standard of opponent.

‘It’s not good enough,’ said the Norwegian midfielder. ‘ At least we’re through. But we need to do much better than this if we’re going to go through the next round. It wasn’t our best game and while I’m happy we’re through we must be much better in the knockout stage.

‘I don’t think the performance had anything to do with the fact we were already through. We all looked sharp before the game and we just shouldn’t concede four goals in the manner we did.

‘I can’t put my finger on why it happened. We wanted to go out and win the game. We said before the match it was important because of the co-efficient and to ensure we’re seeded in next season’s Champions League play-off.

‘We must make sure we are better next time and develop as a team and as players so we are prepared for the next round in February.

‘I can’t imagine what a team would do to us in the next round if we played like that. Dinamo Zagreb are a good team but you can find better teams than them with top players so we need to be better.’

Virgil van Dijk is adamant that Celtic - who conceded three in their previous Europa League game against Red Bull Salzburg - will get it right through hard work on the training ground over the next two months.

 ‘We need to learn from this and move on,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think there is any need to be too concerned. We showed already we can be compact and press well.

‘We need to do that in Europe too but we have plenty of time to improve and work.

‘We need a lot of improvement defensively. As a team, we need to stay compact. We need to work on that and we already are. I think it’s better than it was at the start of the season.

‘We are working on our shape and trying to make the space as small as possible for the opposition. If the lines are too big between attack and defence, they can score and that’s what happened twice on the counter attack.’
