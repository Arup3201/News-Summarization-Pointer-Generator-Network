Upset Frenchmen have accused British rivals of abusing them while wearing Union Jacks in skirmishes off the coast of Normandy over access to scallop stocks.

New video footage has shown for the first time the intense rows between fishermen from both sides of the Channel after the entente cordiale collapsed spectacularly this week.

On Monday 40 French vessels attacked a fleet of eight British boats with flares and rocks in international waters because they claim they have been fishing scallops out of season.

Gallic fishermen are today seen claiming
 they are being goaded by the Britons, who they say are even flashing their 
bottoms from their ships as they exchange insults.

Entente un-cordiale: Relations between French and British fishermen have collapsed with this man claiming Britons have been mooning them, swearing and wearing Union Jacks

'They are mooning us, doing the finger, wearing Union Jacks,' said one French fisherman to France 24, visibly upset at what was happening.

Another was filmed screaming from his ship: 'I don't understand you. Go take a jump,' while a colleague added: 'The British don't give a damn about us. The French government is protecting them.'

British sailors were also filmed calling out that they were in international waters and had been for months.

Yesterday they called for Royal Navy protection to stop further attempts to prevent them fishing for the highly prized mollusc in Seine Bay, off the coast of Normandy.

EU laws prevent British vessels in 
this area from fishing within 12 miles of the French coast. 

Trawler boss Andrew McLeod said: 
'We have every legal right to fish. We are just going to carry on plying
 our legal trade and hope the French will leave us alone.'

Skipper Anton Bailey, from Brixham, 
south Devon, said the crews of four French boats 'threw rocks and tried 
to ram us'. He added: 'They were shooting flares at other vessels – 
every underhand thing you could  think of.

'The French were throwing rocks at 
our windows and crews and trying to ram us. I have never seen this 
before and I have been at sea for 20 years.' 

Television footage showed French fisherman burning English rugby shirts, swearing and making offensive gestures at the cameras.

The attacks, which lasted for six 
hours, came to a halt only when a French Navy vessel and the French 
coastguard intervened. Fisherman Clinton Powell, from Devon, added: 
'Something has got to be done – we need naval protection.

'None of our skippers could get away with it – we'd be locked up and legal action taken right away.'

But French fishermen have vowed to 
take further action after officials in Paris refused to cave in to their
 demand for a ban on all fishing in the Bay of Seine, in a bid to stop 
the 'pillage' of the cash-rich stock.

Based in small ports on the Normandy 
coast, the fishermen are within easy range of the Channel ferry ports of
 Cherbourg, Calais, Le Harve, Dieppe and Caen.

Paul Francoise, of the Calvados 
Fishing Committee, said: 'We appealed to the French government to stop 
all fishing vessels – French and British – from entering the Seine Bay, 
but they said it was impossible.

'There will be further action. This will certainly mean strikes and blockades. The government must take notice.'

Fisherman Claude Milliner said: 
'Enough is enough. We are going to step up our action. Instead of 40 
boats, we will be 120. We have nothing to lose. Now we are going to have
 to fight to defend our livelihood. Our English friends are pillaging. 
They have told us that they have no intention of leaving the area.'

The dispute erupted when the Normandy
 fleet returned to sea on October 1 and discovered how much British 
boats had harvested during the summer period, when French fishermen 
maintained a voluntary ban to preserve stocks.

A spokesman for the British fishermen
 said: 'The French are a bit peeved because we are near to their 12-mile
 limit, but the French have been fishing on our 12-mile limit for 
donkeys' years.'

Last night Fisheries Minister Richard
 Benyon said the UK was working with the French authorities and would 
'encourage action should further incidents take place'.

In 2011, British vessels landed 52,900 tonnes of scallops at UK ports valued at £62.7 million.
