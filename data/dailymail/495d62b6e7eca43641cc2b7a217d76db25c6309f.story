His father may be a Manchester United legend but Brooklyn Beckham is well on his way to a career at Arsenal.

The 15-year-old, a known Gunners fan, signed for the club's youth team late last year and has now posted a first picture of him with his new team-mates.

David Beckham's eldest son can be seen sitting in the changing room with the other Under 16 squad players. The photo is simply captioned: 'Squad'.

It wasn't just Brooklyn's famous father that made him stand out from his team-mates though, he was also the only one to be wearing adidas tracksuit bottoms in a room full of Puma.  

The teen, who previously had trials with Chelsea, Fulham, Manchester United and Queens Parks Rangers, was first reported to have signed a short-term deal with Arsenal back in November.

David and Victoria Beckham's eldest son was said to have impressed several clubs, but decided to go with the Gunners.

Despite David's history at Old Trafford, the Beckham family have strong connections with the north Londoners.

The former Real Madrid midfielder's youngest son Cruz, nine, is a member of the Under 10 side while Romeo, 12, plays for Arsenal's Under 13s. 

Brooklyn uploaded a couple of snaps of him with his famous parents via Instagram
