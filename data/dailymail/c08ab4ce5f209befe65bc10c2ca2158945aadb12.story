Nearly half a million TV viewers avoid paying the licence fee every year by only watching BBC content online, it has emerged.

The corporation has admitted that up to two per cent of all households exploit a legal loophole that permits them to catch up on their favourite shows on BBC iPlayer for free.

And although households are technically required to buy a £145.50 licence if they watch live broadcasts on tablets or computers, it is thought many avoid detection because the BBC is unable to monitor who is watching on the internet.

Critics said the figures prove the licence fee is now ‘out of date’, and even the BBC admitted its current funding model creates ‘perverse incentives’ that encourage viewers to use its catch-up service instead of watching live.

As director general Tony Hall pushes ahead with an ambitious £100million a year plan to put even more of the BBC’s content online, some suggested the Government will have to rethink the entire licence fee arrangement when it renews the BBC charter in 2016.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘The model for the licence fee is long out of date thanks to technological advances. It’s time to reform this out of date tax so as to ease the burden it places on households while ensuring the BBC has a fair and sustainable source of funding.’

Writing to the Commons culture, media and
 sport committee – which is conducting an inquiry into the corporation’s
 future – the BBC this week admitted its licence fee arrangements may 
need to be modernised to keep up with new  technology.

'We don't pay a television licence - he watches next door's telly'

It said: ‘The licence fee definition remains robust, with only 1-2 per cent of households consuming exclusively on-demand content and so not requiring a licence fee.

‘However, the definition could start to create perverse incentives, with a fee payable for some ways of consuming BBC TV but not others.

‘We would welcome discussing this issue with the committee to consider whether and when the licence fee should be modernised again.’

Given there are 26.4million households in the UK, the BBC’s admission means that as many as 528,000 could be evading the licence fee by using the catch-up loophole.

Last year, 428,359 signed official declarations saying they did not need a TV licence. Viewers are only required to buy a licence if they watch live broadcasts, regardless of whether they own a television set or not.

However, the BBC has no access to data from internet providers that would enable it to identify the names and addresses of those who watch its programmes live online, meaning it is virtually impossible to track down those who do so without paying.

A BBC spokesman insisted ‘we can and do prosecute people watching TV on equipment other than TV sets’.

However, in reply to a request by the Daily Mail, the corporation said it was unable to provide any statistics on the number or frequency of such prosecutions.

BBC iPlayer is increasingly popular with viewers, receiving more than 242million hits a month, with 25 per cent coming from tablet computers.

The corporation has also experimented with showing some programmes – including all BBC3 scripted comedy – on iPlayer before airing them on terrestrial TV.

A TV Licensing spokesperson said: ‘Our enforcement approach enables us to catch and prosecute people watching live TV online. Well under 2 per cent of households watch only catch up TV so don’t need a licence.

‘Households declaring they do not need a TV Licence have remained stable for the past three years.

‘Reasons a licence may not be required include if the address is unoccupied, if no TV receiving equipment is being used, if a TV is used only to watch DVDs, or if only catch up services are used.’
