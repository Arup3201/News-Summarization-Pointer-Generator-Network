Having spent the past two seasons watching Steffon Armitage smash opponents in matches and team-mates in training, Bryan Habana admits he’s delighted not to be facing England’s exiled No 7 at Twickenham on Saturday.

South Africa’s former World Player of the Year has no doubt his Toulon colleague, who is unavailable for selection because of the RFU’s policy of not picking overseas-based players, would make Stuart Lancaster’s side a more fearsome proposition.

England captain Chris Robshaw will wear the No 7 shirt against the Springboks though many pundits, including Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward, believe the Harlequin would be better suited at blindside with the destructive, scavenging Armitage in the pivotal openside position.

After spending two seasons alongside Armitage at Toulon, where the Englishman has played a central role in back-to-back Heineken Cup victories and was last season named European Player of the Year, Habana agrees.

‘I’m very happy I play with Steffon at Toulon and in the same breath I’m very happy I am not playing against him this weekend,’ Habana said.

‘Steffon is a quality player who proved last season, not only in the Top 14 but also in the Heineken Cup, that he wouldn’t let that English outfit down.

‘The powers that be have certain rules and we have to let that stand but I think he could play a big part in this English team if he got that opportunity.’

Armitage, 29, won five caps under Martin Johnson but has not played for England since before the last World Cup. But he still hopes he could be considered for next autumn’s World Cup under the ‘exceptional circumstances’ clause in the RFU regulations.

That hope appears slim after Lancaster last week reaffirmed his backing for a selection policy designed to discourage players from moving the French Top 14, where average salaries are significantly higher than those in the Aviva Premiership.

Armitage won five caps for England when he was playing for London Irish between 2009 and 2011

‘Who knows what will happen?’ Habana added. ‘Come 10 months’ time at the start of the World Cup there might be a case for special inclusion for someone like Steffon, who really has played an influential part in the success Toulon have had over the past two or three seasons.

‘He’s playing a brand of rugby that means he should be selected but at this stage England are adhering to their protocols. So I am sad he has not gone on to higher honours this time around and also happy I won’t be facing him this time too.’

Last month Bath made an audacious bid to bring Armitage back across the Channel but were thwarted when Lancaster refused to give assurances to the former London Irish player about his inclusion in England’s elite player squad.

‘It’s sad that a player of his calibre isn’t getting exposure at international level,’ Habana added.

‘He definitely wouldn’t let that England jersey down, but unfortunately he chose that option a couple of years ago and has to live by his decision.

‘As a player you understand the rules and regulations so when you do decide to take an offer overseas coming from a country where those rules are in place, you fully understand what you’re getting into.

‘I’ve had chats with Steffon about it. It’s difficult for him. He really loves England and loved playing for the country.

‘It’s frustrating if you’ve been playing a level of rugby that sees you named European player of the year yet are not playing for your international team.

‘It could be a little heart-breaking for him, but it’s a decision he’s taken and a decision he understands.’

Habana was  named to face England by Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer, who has made five changes to the side who surprisingly lost to Ireland in Dublin last Saturday.

Schalk Burger returns to face Robshaw on the openside flank and half-backs Handre Pollard and Francois Hougaard are dropped in favour of Pat Lambie and Cobus Reinach.

Meyer said: ‘We’ve accepted that our performance against Ireland last weekend was not up to scratch and everyone in the touring squad has put up their hands this week.

‘We’ve really worked hard at fixing the mistakes we made and the challenge now is to put that into action on Saturday.’

Lancaster names his side on Thursday with Anthony Watson expected to be given his first start on the right wing opposite Habana following the withdrawal of Semesa Rokoduguni with injury.

Courtney Lawes is expected to be named at lock despite having been taken off 23 minutes into Saturday’s defeat against New Zealand suffering concussion following two separate head knocks in the space of four minutes which left him with an egg-sized lump on the side of his head.

Lancaster is set to persevere with Kyle Eastmond and Brad Barritt in midfield, despite calls to move Owen Farrell to inside centre and give George Ford his first start at 10. But Robshaw admits his side are under huge pressure following their opening QBE series loss to the All Blacks.

He said: ‘Whenever it’s a tournament or a series you want to start with a win. There’s probably nothing worse than starting a series with a loss. So there’s a huge amount of pressure on the guys to go out and deliver this weekend.

‘We’re not going to wait for the physicality and intensity which I’m sure these guys will bring. Being at home we want to impose ourselves and get back on track.’

The autumn internationals on Sky Sports are part of an unrivalled schedule of rugby union with over 360 matches from the international, European and domestic game.
