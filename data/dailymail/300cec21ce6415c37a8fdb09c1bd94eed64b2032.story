Millie Mackintosh loves to hang out with her pet pug Herby, and Mollie King's adoration for furry friend Alfie is well documented, but it's not just celebrities who are pet obsessed.

According to the latest research, 4.1m Brits are so potty about their pets they let them take over their social lives, whether that’s a night out with friends or giving them pride of place on their social media profiles.

Gone are the days of leaving pets at home, as research shows 1.8 million pet owners will even take them to the pub.

They also make sure their four-legged-friends are involved in their digital social life; with 2.3 million pet loving Brits giving them a prominent place on their online profiles.

Over a quarter of plugged-in pet owners regularly share photos of their furry friends on sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And one in seven ‘Petstagrammers’ take this one step further admitting they upload more pictures of animal than of their friends and family.

In fact, one in 20 even comment on friends’ Facebook statuses as their pet.

Young people aged 18 – 24 are the most prolific ‘Petstagrammers’, with four in ten regularly sharing photos of their pets online.

They are also the most likely to create a dedicated social media account for their pet, with 14 per cent saying they have followed in the footsteps of Millie Mackintosh who’s dog Herby has its own Twitter account.

Pets not only dominate their owners’ social lives, it seems they also dominate the weekly budget too, with one in five pet lovers claiming they would only ever consider gourmet food brands for their pet despite the economic gloom.

One in seven even go as far as preparing meals from scratch for their pet.

In contrast, a quarter had no qualms about buying supermarket value food for themselves.

It’s not only food that has to be the best for UK pets - when it comes to outfits and accessories, one in 20 admit they buy new items specifically so their pet looks good in photographs.

Duncan Jennings, co-founder of VoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'People have always been proud of their pets and it’s interesting to see how this has now transcended to their social lives and in particular social networking.

'Like many trends, celebrities are leading the way by pampering their pets before posting pictures online. However, not everyone has a celebrity budget, so savvy shoppers looking to treat their pets for less should look out for the many deals and discounts that are regularly available online.'
