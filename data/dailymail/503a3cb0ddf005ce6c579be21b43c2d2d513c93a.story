A New Hampshire police chief accused of offering to drop charges against a college student if he allowed her to take nude photos of her has resigned this week while escaping criminal charges.

Chief David Seastrand, a 27-year veteran of the New London police department, resigned on Thursday following a March 6 complaint by a woman whom he had arrested a few days earlier.

'There was an extended attempt to bargain away her criminal charges in exchange for her allowing herself to be photographed naked,' attorney Richard Lehmann told the Concord Monitor.

'Obviously she refused, and frankly, it was a brave act for her to report this matter to the attorney general’s office,' he said of the woman who is a student at nearby Colby Sawer College.

The attorney general's said it will not bring charges against Seastrand, 50, who in exchange agreed to resign and permanently relinquish his certification as a police officer.

The unnamed woman had been arrested on minor charges of suspicion of underage 
drinking and giving a false name, according to Lehmann.

He said she is now considering lawsuits against both Seastrand and the town.

Abuse: Last month a student at Colby Sawer College accused him of offering to drop charges against her if she posed naked, prompting her complaint against him a few days later

'She’s had to live in town, continue 
going to school in town, knowing this was pending all this time,' her 
lawyer said. 'And that’s caused her a great deal of stress and 
interfered with her life.'

Seastrand told town officials on Monday that he planned to retire later this month but did not give a reason.

'It has been my honor to have worked with so many 
dedicated individuals throughout the years, that have made this job, and my 
experiences working here so meaningful,' he said in a statement.
