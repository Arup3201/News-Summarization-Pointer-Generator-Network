Thousands of Arctic birds congregate on a cliff - as they nest hundreds of feet in the air.

The guillemots swoop onto tiny ledges no more than a few inches wide to make their nest away from the harsh Arctic winds that lash Franz Josef Land, off the coast of Russia.

It is estimated 55,000 birds breed on this 650ft cliff, making it the biggest colony on the the archipelago.

The spectacular sight was spotted by wildlife photographer Pel Hermansen, 57, from a Russian icebreaker ship.

The Norwegian said: 'The density of birds is much higher here than elsewhere. All you can hear is a constant roaring noise in the proximity of the cliff.

'This is the perfect nesting place for the birds, very close to rich fishing grounds.

Pear-shaped: These guillemots are colony breeders, laying their single, pear-shaped egg, which restricts the egg from falling down when the bird flies off, directly on the cliff

'They are colony breeders, laying their single, pear shaped egg, which restricts the egg from falling down when the bird flies off, directly on the cliff.'

Pel, a dentist from Oslo, Norway, said: 'It is said that approximately 55,000 birds breed here.

'The cliff is called Rubini Rock and is characterised by lots of hexagon basalt columns, curved and formed in different shapes over time.'
