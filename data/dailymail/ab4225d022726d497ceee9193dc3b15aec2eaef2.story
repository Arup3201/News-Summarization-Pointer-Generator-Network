Pioneer: Charles Darwin told his son about having had a passion for ice hockey prior to 1825

Canada's national pride has been dealt a serious blow after Britain laid to inventing ice hockey - claiming Charles Darwin was one of the sport's first ever participants.

A recently-discovered letter sent by the famous naturalist in 1853 asks his young son if he has a good pond at school, adding: 'I used to be very fond of playing at Hocky [sic] on the ice in skates'.

The letter casts serious doubt on generally accepted Canadian claims that ice hockey was invented in the country in the 1870s and that the first proper match was played in Montreal in 1875.

Darwin's letter was sent to his then 13-year-old son William, who was boarding at Shrewsbury School at the time, on March 1, 1853.

'My Dear Old Willy… have you got a pretty good pond to skate on? I used to be very fond of playing at Hocky [sic] on the ice in skates,' he wrote.

The evolutionary theorist had himself attended the school as a boarder between 1818 and 1825 himself, and it is thought his reference to enjoying 'hockey on the ice' relates to this time.

If that is the case, ice hockey would have been played in Britain at least 50 years earlier than the first officially recognised match in Canada, where is it now a national sport and general obsession.

The claim will come as something of a blow to Canadians, who are taught to play the game almost as soon as they learn to walk.

Jean-Patrice Martel, a member of the Society for International Hockey 
Research, poured fuel of the fire by claiming the early 1820s was around the time that a game
 recognisable as ice hockey started.

'We expect a lot of people won’t believe it and some will have much difficulty in believing it,' he told The Independent.

'It’s something you have been told since you were the youngest age, that you’ve been told by your parents,' he added.

Despite potentially breaking Canadian 
hearts with his claims, Martel gave them at least something to hold on 
to by suggesting the ice hockey played in Britain in the early 1800s 
would have been a slow, primitive sport compared to the high-energy, 
high-impact game we know and love today.

'We wouldn’t want to say Canada has no claim at all [to the game] – that’s not true... Canada took the game, sped it up and made it better. Canada really made the game its own and hockey is truly a Canadian game now'.

The Darwin letter appears in a new book French Canadian Martel wrote alongside two Swedish colleagues, medical doctor Carl Giden and sports writer Patrick Houda.

Titled 'On the Origins of Hockey' in a deliberate nod to Darwin's seminal work 'On the Origins of Species', the trio also found an entry in the Lincolnshire Chronicle dated February 16, 1838 that backs up claims the ice hockey was being played in Britain in the first half of the 19th century.

The entry reads: 'On Saturday last, an amusing scene took place on a splendid sheet of ice which covered Croxby Pond.

'A large party from the neighbouring residence of Geo. Alington, Esq., of Swinhop House, drove up in sledges to the pond.

'The ladies were drawn upon the ice in traineau, while the gentlemen performed various feats upon their skates: after going through several quadrilles, reels and playing a warmly contested game at hockey, the party partook of a cold collation, and again stepping into their sledges, glided swiftly away.'

Reacting to the claims made in the book, Toronto newspaper The National Post called the idea of ice hockey being invented in Britain a 'puck-shattering thought', adding it is 'sure to rankle Canadian hockey patriots'.
