Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers were locked in a war of words on Sunday night after Chelseabeat Liverpool 2-1 to stay in the thick of the Barclays Premier League title race.

Samuel Eto’o scored the winner at Stamford Bridge, courtesy of another Simon Mignolet mistake.

But Chelsea boss Mourinho later branded Liverpool striker Luis Suarez an ‘acrobatic’ diver over the Uruguayan’s two alleged attempts to con referee Howard Webb after challenges in the penalty area.

Controversy: Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o (right) challenges Liverpool's Luis Suarez in the penalty area

Contact: Eto'o's right leg appears to stop Suarez's determined chase of Cesar Azpilicueta

Ouch: Suarez screams in pain as he goes down in Chelsea's penalty area during the second half

Appeal: Suarez gestures for a penalty but is ignored by referee Howard Webb

Mourinho said: ‘This is a special country. I’m not English but I feel I have a responsibility in defending some values in this football. 

‘One of the good things we have is we don’t like simulation. 

‘This situation in the box, with Azpilicueta and Eto’o, stop this or give Suarez a yellow card. It’s not good for our game. 

Unimpressed: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Suarez deserved to be booked for his theatrics at Stamford Bridge

Light-hearted? Mourinho and Liverpool's Suarez share a joke before the second-half begins

Acrobatic: Mourinho accused Suarez of performing a 'swimming pool jump' after his side's 2-1 victory

‘Eto’o comes in and it looks like somebody shot him (Suarez) in the back. For me that is a clear yellow card.

‘He’s doing an acrobatic swimming-pool jump to try to get the penalty because he’s so clever he knows he’s in  the penalty area with the Liverpool supporters behind.

‘If a Chelsea player did that, I’d tell them not to do it.’ 

Quiet word: Referee Howard Webb speaks to Suarez but did not book the Uruguayan for simulation

Going down: Suarez hits the ground after a tangle with Chelsea defender Gary Cahill

Rodgers, who has a close friendship with Mourinho, hit back by insisting Eto’o should have been sent off for a late challenge on Jordan Henderson after three minutes.

He said: ‘That was a wild shank where he’s come down his knee and shin and he didn’t even get a yellow card. 

‘That’s the first wild challenge. The second one, Luis will always provoke a challenge in the box. Eto’o blocks him. That could have been a penalty on another day.’

Studs up: Rodgers believes Chelsea striker Eto'o should've seen red for this dangerous tackle on midfielder Jordan Henderon
