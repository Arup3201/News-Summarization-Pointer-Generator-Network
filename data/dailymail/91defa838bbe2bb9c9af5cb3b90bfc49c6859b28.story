Wayne Rooney could be offered an unlikely route out of Manchester United by Spanish giants Real Madrid this summer.

With Rooney now in to the last 18 months of his contract at Old Trafford and unlikely to sign a new one, he knows that there is no way United will sell him to one of their own domestic rivals.

However, it has emerged that Real have the 28-year-old on a list of three centre forward targets this summer, behind Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Monaco's unsettled Colombian goalscorer Radamel Falcao.

Exit door? Manchester United star Wayne Rooney has emerged as a surprise target for Real Madrid

Re-United: Any move to Spain for Rooney would see him link up with former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo

Wanted man: Real are also eyeing up Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, here scoring against West Ham

Cristiano Ronaldo - United 2003-2009

                             - Real 2009-present

David Beckham - United 1993-2003

                          - Real 2003-2007

Michael Owen - Real 2004-2005

                       - United 2009-2012

Gabriel Heinze - United 2004-2007

                        - Real 2007-2009

Ruud van Nistelrooy - 2001-2006

                                 - 2006-2010

Laurie Cunningham  - Real 1979-1984

                                 - United 1983 (loan)

With City highly unlikely to let Aguero go and Falcao tied in to a long contract in the south of France, Rooney would represent a cheaper option for Madrid who are by all accounts attracted by his form this season and the fact he can play as a front-running striker or as a number ten.

Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti knows all about Rooney from his own time at Chelsea, of course, but the real driving force behind any move is president Florentino Perez, who has been an admirer of the England star for some time.

United will try to resist any attempts by Madrid to force through a transfer, happier to let Rooney run down his contract and leave for free in the summer of 2015. 

Just at the weekend, informed that 
Chelsea's Jose Mourinho had predicted Rooney would be sold abroad this 
summer, manager David Moyes said: 'I disagree'.

Meet the new boss: Real manager Carlo Ancelotti knows all about Rooney from his time at Chelsea

Foreign climes: Monaco hitman Radamel Falcao is also on Real's list of transfer targets

The records of the three Real rivals this season...

Wayne Rooney: Games: 25 Goals: 11

Radamel Falcao: Games: 17 Goals: 9 (League only)

Sergio Aguero: Games: 23 Goals: 22 

Worryingly for Moyes right now, meanwhile, is the fact that neither Rooney or his strike partner Robin van Persie trained as expected.

It is understood that Van Persie has been held back while Rooney's groin is only giving him a 50-50 chance of playing in the Barclays Premier League game against Cardiff next Tuesday.

Neither player will feature in the Capital One Cup against Sunderland.

Making his point: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho predicted Rooney would be sold to an overseas club

Meanwhile, United are confident of landing Juan Mata from Chelsea in a £37million deal by the end of the week.

Talks regarding the 25-year-old Spain midfielder are so far advanced that Mata is convinced he will have a medical before the weekend.

Mata is determined to leave Chelsea after becoming frustrated with his failure to impress Jose Mourinho this season.
