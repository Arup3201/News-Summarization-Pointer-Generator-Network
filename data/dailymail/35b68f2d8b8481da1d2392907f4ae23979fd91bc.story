Selfridges has reported aN increase in sales of insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation suggested that eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages.

The department store has recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales of Edible's insect-based snacks including Thai Green Curry Crickets, Dark Chocolate Covered Scorpions and BBQ Flavour Worm Crisps.

According to the WHO, insects are a more sustainable protein source than other meats.

Selfridges has noticed a surge in demand for insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation claimed that eating bugs could help solve worldwide food shortages

The UN's Food and Agricultural Agency says that more than two billion people - 30 per cent of the planet's population - already supplement their diet with insects.

A 200-page report, released at a news conference at the U.N. agency's Rome headquarters, says 2 billion people worldwide already supplement their diets with insects, which are high in protein and minerals, and have environmental benefits.

Commenting on the increase in sales, Emma Murphy, Selfridges Confectionery
 Buyer said: 'The Edible range has a broad appeal and there are a number
 of customers who appreciate the high protein levels in the range as it 
offers an alternative to high protein diets.

'The
 Mopain Ants have as much protein per gram as a breast of chicken.  
Around Christmas time, we find customers buy  the range for novelty 
value.

'The Scorpion 
vodka, The Gold Lolly and the Mopain worms do really well over Christmas
 especially as 'I'm a Celebrity' is on at that time, too.'

Insects are 'extremely efficient' in converting feed into edible meat, according to the WHO report.

On average, they can convert 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of feed into 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of insect mass. In comparison, cattle require 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of feed to produce a kilo of meat.

Insects are full of protein, fibre and a range of micronutrients

Currently, most edible insects are gathered in forests and what insect farming does take place is often family-run and serves niche markets.

But the U.N. says mechanisation can ratchet up insect farming production. The fish bait industry, for example, has long farmed insects.

Insect farming is 'one of the many ways to address food and feed security,' the food agency said.

'Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly,' the agency said, adding they leave a 'low environmental footprint.'

They provide high-quality protein and nutrients when compared with meat and fish and are 'particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children,' it said.

Insects can also be rich in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc, and are a source of fibre.

The agency noted that its Edible Insect Program is also examining the potential of arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, although they are not strictly speaking insects.

University biologists have analysed the nutritional value of edible insects, and some of them, such as certain beetles, ants, crickets and grasshoppers, come close to lean red meat or broiled fish in terms of protein per gram.

 Worm Salt; £7.99

Infused with chilli and agave worm, the salt has an intense smoky flavour, traditionally used in southern Mexico as a seasoning for salsas.

English Gin infused with an edible earthworm; £26.99

These earthworms are grown in the fertile soils of Southern England. You can eat the worm after drinking the gin, it makes a delightful treat.

Chocolate Covered Scorpion; £5.99

Farm-raised edible scorpion has been hand-dipped in Belgian dark chocolate. The scorpion has a crisp, wafer-like texture and a pleasant nutty taste similar to walnut.

Tequila worm lollipop; £5.19

The worm is specially bred for human consumption and has been reared on a special diet of cereals and fresh greens.
