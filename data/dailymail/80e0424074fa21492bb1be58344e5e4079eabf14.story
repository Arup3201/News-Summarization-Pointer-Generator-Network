They are the far-from-dapper dads who are taking the internet by storm, thanks to an assortment of socks with crocks, Hawaiian shirts and short shorts.

Fashion Dads, a new account on Instagram, may have been more appropriately called Fashion Dags, but it's still become the must-stop profile of the week.

Created by Ashley Hesseltine - author of the blog Witty + Pretty - and her friend Travis May, the pair decided it was a great way to show the questionable - but so normal - outfit choices of some fathers, while simultaneously poke fun at style bloggers who take their job way too seriously.

'We were talking about our own dads' ridiculous outfits and were like, ''We should create an Instagram account for this'',' Hesseltine told the Today show.
