Herded like cattle into the rusty hull of an ageing merchant vessel, these are the desperate migrants abandoned by people traffickers to drift helplessly at sea.

Grainy photos taken on board freighter Blue Sky M reveal how 796 migrants, including women and children, were packed together in squalor on the freezing metal floor.

One image was taken by a 35-year-old Syrian, who claims he paid almost £11,000 for himself and his pregnant wife to make the journey.

And on board a second so-called ghost ship, authorities this week found 359 people shivering and starving who had been crammed into freezing livestock holds on a 50-year-old freighter called Ezadeen.

With nowhere to sit or sleep, the migrants were forced to squeeze between metal bars designed to contain cattle and sheep and huddle together in the filthy pens.

The passengers, including 54 women – several of whom were pregnant – and 74 children, eight of whom were unaccompanied, endured a miserable ten-day voyage before they were rescued on Friday night.

They ran out of food, drink and fuel after five days, when the smugglers apparently locked them in the decaying vessel and escaped on a lifeboat.

Police believe the traffickers made almost £2million from the ‘socially well-off’ illegal migrants, believed to be from war-torn Syria, who would have each paid between £2,000 and £5,000 for their place on the perilous journey.

The smugglers’ tactic appears to be to point a cargo ship full of migrants towards Italy, before abandoning the ship and letting the coastguard pick it up.

The gangs buy rusty vessels at the end of their life for around £100,000 before selling spots to hundreds of migrants. Ezadeen, a Sierra Leone-flagged ship, was the 15th to reach Italy in just three months.

It was towed to port by a coastguard ship on Friday night after a female migrant managed to operate the radio to tell them the ship had been abandoned by the crew.

Save the Children spokesman Giovanna di Benedetto said: ‘They left ten days ago from Turkey and they had five days without food or drink. 

'They told us the crossing was very, very difficult and very, very dangerous.’

The migrants will now be taken to immigration centres and assessed to see if they have a valid claim for asylum. 

Before they can be granted asylum they must persuade authorities that they are fleeing persecution and would face harm or death if sent back to their country of origin.

Illegal migration to the EU has been fuelled by the civil war in Syria, which has driven people to seek asylum in Europe.

The police chief of Cosenza province, Luigi Liguori, said criminal gangs are now attracting better-off, more middle-class migrants. 

‘We’ve noticed a change in the make-up of the Syrian refugees on board,’ he said, adding: ‘They are socially well off. They wear better clothes and are better organised.’

Last year it is estimated that nearly 3,500 refugees died trying to cross the Mediterranean while another 200,000 were rescued.
