Anger: Leigh Turner's wife Anita Turner was recorded telling her son that she his model girlfriend had 'ruined his life'

The mother of a man accused of strangling his model girlfriend in a jealous rage was recorded telling her son that she had 'ruined his life'.

Anita Turner, 51, denies helping her son Elliot cover up the murder of 17-year-old Emily Longley in his bedroom at their £350,000 home.

Mrs Turner broke down at Winchester Crown Court yesterday as she described how she had told Miss Longley's grandmother that she was safe in her care.

She insisted her heavily built son had not murdered the part time Top Shop worker despite having a row with her in the hours before her death.

But the court was played covert recordings the police had made in Mrs Turner's home in the weeks after Miss Turner's death in May last year.

In the tapes Mrs Turner is heard in conversation with her jeweller husband Leigh, 54, and Turner, 20, telling him to claim he had acted in 'self defence.'

Indonesian born Mrs Turner tells her son: 'She kicked you and kicked you, even though she is slim she does kick boxing, it was self defence. Stick with it.'

Later Mrs Turner is heard saying: 'You have got to stick to it that you didn't do anything.'

When asked about her comments she told the court: 'I don't know what self defence means.

'It's what they say in the movies when someone has a fight and an accident happens. When I told him to stick with it I meant stick with the truth.'

The jury also heard a recording of her telling her son that Emily had ruined his life.

He is heard saying: 'I was always the one who looked like the bad guy but she caused it. That f***ing bird.

'That girl has ruined my life.'

To which Mrs Turner replied: 'She did, she did ruin your life.'

Under cross examination Mrs Turner was asked if she Emily had ruined her son's life.

She paused for several seconds before saying: 'No.'

The court was also told Turner had sent a text message to his mother in the hours before Miss Longley's death saying: 'I'm sorry for my sins.'

However Mrs Longley insisted this text was nothing to do with Miss Longley and her son was apologising for swearing and being 'horrendous' to her in the week before.

Under cross examination Mrs Turner insisted the text message did not worry her saying: 'you have portrayed it so horrendously.'

The court has heard how Turner, 20, had held his girlfriend's neck for 'five or six seconds' during a violent argument before she died.

In his evidence he claimed he stormed out of his bedroom 'disgusted' with himself before writing a letter to his mother and putting it under her door asking her forgiveness.

Mrs Turner yesterday denied seeing any letter pushed under her door in the hours after Miss Longley's death.

Simon Jones prosecuting said: 'You would do anything for your son Mrs Turner?'

She replied: 'Not if he harmed somebody, of course not.'

Mrs Turner claimed her son had woken her in the morning asking for her help because Emily would not wake up.

She insisted she did not think Miss Longley was dead because she had struggled to wake her on other occasions and had even had to put a wet flannel on her face in the past.

She said: 'I called her name. Emily was asleep with the duvet (on her). She didn't wake up so I just tapped on the duvet.

'I called, "Emily, Emily, wake up, wake up". She didn't wake up. I didn't think anything at all. I made a cup of tea and I still called her.

'I climbed on the side (of the bed). I tried to let her sip the tea but her mouth would not move. I called Elliot and we were both trying to wake her - we kept shaking her.

'I said, 'there is something really wrong - she does not move. He (Turner) said, "I think she got a terrible, terrible headache last night".

'I didn't know what to do. I called my husband.'

Mrs Turner was asked why she did not call an ambulance and she replied that at that point she did not believe Emily was dead.

She then said she peeled an orange in the hope the aroma would wake Emily when she put it under her nose.

She added that her son was 'really gobsmacked' by what had happened. Asked if she knew straight away that Emily was dead, Mrs Turner said no.

She was then asked if her son told her he ended Emily's life on the morning of Saturday May 7, and again Mrs Turner said no.

The prosecution claims Turner strangled Miss Longley and that he was a violent and jealous boyfriend, fearful she was being unfaithful.

He went 'absolutely nuts', it is claimed, in a culmination of a month of anger and upset over his suspicions that she was 'twisting his heart'.

When arrested he had his passport in his pocket and his bags packed, the court heard.

He told paramedics the couple had argued and Emily had attacked him and he defended himself and then when he woke up she was dead.

He told officers at the scene: 'I never meant to harm her, I just defended myself.' He then made no comment in police interviews.

Computers seized from the home had Google searches for 'death by strangulation' and 'how to get out of being charged for murder'.

Yesterday the court heard Mr Turner has admitted paranoia led him to believe a letter he found could have been his son's confession.

He said that all he saw was 'Dear Mum' in his son’s handwriting and he had 'paranoid thoughts of what had happened' so he destroyed it.

Mr and Mrs Turner deny perverting the course of justice.

Emily was born in Britain but her family emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand, when she was nine.

She had returned to live with her grandparents in Bournemouth to study when she died.

Elliot Turner denies the murder of Emily at the house in Bournemouth in May last year but he admits perverting the cause of justice.
