Mount Si pupil Carli Rogers was one of six cheerleaders at her school who got sick. She lost her appetite on Sunday night then vomited on Monday.

'When I heard that people were getting hospitalised it kind of worried me that it might not be normal,' she told KOMO.

A state health spokesman told KOMO-TV that he had not heard of any further hospitalisations ‘but that doesn't mean it hasn't happened’.

The outbreak has flu-like symptoms similar to those found in the illnesses norovirus, rotavirus or a food-borne illness.

The Washington Interscholastic Activities Association hosted the competition and the first symptoms developed on Sunday and Monday.

Surveys are going to participants and samples are being collected for testing. Anyone with severe symptoms is advised to see a doctor.

Intestinal illnesses can be caused by several viruses and bacteria that may come from a variety of sources, the state health department said.

‘It's a real squishy number (of reported illnesses),’ a spokesman told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ‘We're getting reports from a variety of places.’

There have been reports of students suffering at Puget Sound-area high schools including Marysville, Ballard, Juanita, Mount Si and Skyline.

Students from Pierce and Kitsap counties may also have become ill, a local health district spokesman told The Daily Herald of Everett.

‘Our immediate concerns are for those who have been affected by this illness,’ an association spokesman said. 'Our thoughts are with them.'
