Backing: David Cameron's private secretary used a memo to officials to raise the prospect of opening up state schools to foreign pupils

Foreign pupils would be charged thousands of pounds to attend British state schools under a controversial plan backed by David Cameron.

Despite warnings of a growing shortage of school places, a leaked Downing Street memo reveals a plan is being hatched to open up the education system to more children from overseas.

The letter orders universities minister David Willetts to work with the Department for Education on ways of ‘allowing international students to access places at academies’.

However the plan is set to spark a furious government row, with the Liberal Democrats vowing to block any attempt to part-privatise spaces in the classrooms of state schools.

The four-page letter, marked restricted, was sent by Mr Cameron’s private secretary to Holly White, a senior adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

It sets out ‘suggestions for you to develop and agree’ including allowing the parents of foreign pupils to buy their way into British state education system.

It states: ‘We have some of the most successful and innovative publicly-funded schools in the world and an internationally renowned independent sector.

‘We would ask you to work with the Department for Education on increasing the place of schools in the [education exports industrial] strategy.

‘This is meant to be a long-term strategy and while the Academies / Free Schools programme should focus on consolidating domestic progress over the next couple of year, we should look at export potential too.

‘This should include consideration of allowing international students to access places at academies.’

According to The Times, which obtained the letter, Whitehall insiders have made clear that the Prime Minister would not allow any plan to put further pressure on UK taxpayers.

A source told the newspaper: ‘This week the government has launched a blitz to stop foreigners getting free access to the NHS.

‘Therefore the idea that international pupils would attend British state schools for free is a non starter.’

Places: Opening up state schools to paying foreign pupils could put increased pressure on class sizes

Stephen Twigg, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: ‘Parents will have serious questions for the Prime Minister about opening up schools to overseas pupils.

 ‘Will overseas pupils be able to bypass the admissions rules for local children? Would this cost the UK taxpayer, or would schools become reliant on funding from overseas pupils? David Cameron needs to explain what on earth he’s up to.’

The shortage of school places dominated Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday.

Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed that the country will need 240,000 extra primary school places by 2014.

He added: ‘Class sizes are rising. When the Labour Government came to office, the number of infants being taught in class sizes of over 30 was a quarter. When we left office, it was just 1.8 per cent.

‘It has doubled on the Prime Minister’s watch - that is the reality for lots of parents.’

But Mr Cameron insisted that the government has promised additional money for 500,000 extra school places, ‘so we should be able to provide those school places without seeing an increase in classes’.

‘We have made education a priority. That is why the amount of money going into our schools is going up and not down.

‘That is why we are funding half a million extra school places. That is why this Government have built 200 new school buildings since taking office.’
