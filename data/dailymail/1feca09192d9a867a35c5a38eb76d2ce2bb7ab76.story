A former unpaid intern who was suing CBS and David Letterman's WorldWide Pants production company has now dropped her lawsuit and issued an apology saying she was forced into making the claims lawyers.

Mallory Musallam, 26, who interned at the show for four months between September and December 2008 had accused Letterman and his crew of violating minimum-wage and overtime laws.

She had also claimed for payment for her four months of unpaid work at Letterman's late-night show, 

She has now backed down and written an apology to Mr Letterman and his production team stating, 'While I am ultimately responsible for my actions as an adult, I was caught in a weak, vulnerable time, facing student debt.'

Compensation: The NYU graduate claimed CBS violated violated New York minimum wage and overtime laws but now says she was coerced into it by 'lawsuit-hungry' lawyers

The class action lawsuit had been filed in the New York Supreme Court on behalf of every unpaid Late Show intern from the past six years.

Miss Musallam told the New York Post, 'I have nothing but respect for David Letterman and the whole organization. I wore that internship as a badge of pride.' 

The former intern has said that she is now broke and wants to apologize for the mess she has created. 

'I've had a job since I was 15 and I have always been a hard worker. I was by no means looking for a trap door out by exploiting your established organization and I cannot apologize enough for this debacle.'

In her lawsuit, Musallam claimed that the defendants intentionally minimized their labor costs by giving work to unpaid interns instead of hiring additional employees or paying regular staff overtime to do it.

She also charged that she typically worked more than 40 hours a week but did not receive any payment or vocational training in exchange.

However, the unemployed 26-year-old NYU graduate said that attorneys from the firm Virginia & Ambinder - who have filed at least a dozen similar proposed class-action suits - launched this latest one on her behalf just four days after approaching her on LinkedIn.

Lawyers at the firm have not responded to MailOnline for a comment regarding their tactics. 

She said she was never contacted by anyone at CBS or Letterman's shop and her decision to withdraw the proposed class-action lawsuit on Wednesday was solely her own choice.

No comment: CBS are not commenting on the lawsuit or Musallam's apology

The lawsuit which was seeking wages, with interest, and legal costs 'owed to Named Plaintiff and all similarly situated persons,' was to include around 100 other interns a similar position. 

The network did not contact her to urge her to drop the legal action and is not making any comment.

'This lawsuit is part of a nationwide trend of class action lawyers attacking internship opportunities provided by companies in the media and entertainment industry,' as CBS spokesman said.

'We pride ourselves on providing valuable internship experiences, and we take seriously all of our obligations under relevant labor and employment laws. We intend to vigorously defend against the claims.'

Indeed, Musallam told The Post that she felt duped by the whole affair and that she didn't realize she would be the 'lone ranger' named on the court papers.

'The inveigling suit squad assured me that my intern work was little more than indentured servitude under newly established laws and that I was just one among other participants,' her apology letter reads.

'I feel like I was really duped,' she said.
