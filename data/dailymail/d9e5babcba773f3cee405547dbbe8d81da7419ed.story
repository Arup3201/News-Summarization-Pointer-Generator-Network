A photographer emerged smiling after being hit by a boulder while paragliding as she tried to get a perfect action shot of an extreme stunt.

Krystle Wright, who has travelled the world in the pursuit of her dangerous stunts, suffered multiple injuries while taking pictures in Pakistan.

The 26-year-old, from Queensland, Australia, was left with internal bruising, tendon damage, two fractures, a torn ligament and 10 stitches above her eye following a nasty accident.

Miss Wright took to the air on a dual paraglider and flew at a stomach-churning 18,000 feet to capture the awesome images.

Due to the dizzying height she was hooked up to an oxygen bottle but just six days before the end of the trip she hit a bolder and blacked out following a bad take-off.

She was carried down 600ft of Sherpa trails before being stretchered across a makeshift bridge and enduring a seven hour car journey to the nearest hospital.

Despite this set back Miss Wright vows to return to Pakistan to complete the project and said that although she loved her job some aspects of it were certainly dangerous.

She said: 'When things are moving at a face pace, it's amazing how the mind can work as adrenaline takes over and you do your best to deal with the situation at hand.

'The drive to the military hospital took roughly seven hours on some of the most roughest roads so every jolt in the road would cause me severe pain throughout my bruised body.

'I did my best to not focus on time. I knew if I let myself think of time, then it would cause me extra stress since the whole process took half a day to get to the hospital.

'So I just focused on remaining calm and keeping my mind either empty or distracted which was the best thing I could do.

'I go to some extreme lengths to get the shot but it's also calculated risks. There is no point risking your life and sometimes you need to pull back when the situation is dangerous.

Spectacular: Krystle Wright will stop at nothing to get the perfect picture and suffered multiple injuries while taking these breath-taking extreme paragliding snaps

'It's hard to describe on how far I'd exactly go as every situation is different though I will continue to keep travelling to the far corners of the globe to bring back incredible images.

'I've always believed in trusting my gut instinct. If something doesn't feel right, then I won't do it.

'While taking pictures at such a high altitude my hands became numb and I thought it was frost bite beginning to come on.

'I took my hand out of my mittens and began to thrash it around inside my down jacket and as the blood began to rush back into my hand, I experienced 'the screaming barfies' I wanted to scream as the pain was so intense.

'The other danger of flying at altitude, and especially spending extended lengths of time at altitude is hypoxia, we flew with oxygen bottles to prevent this from happening.

'No doubt there is risk in what I do. The important thing is to keep yourself as safe as possible and try to take calculated risks but sometimes Mother Nature will reign supreme.

'The injuries I've sustained haven't put me off one bit though. If anything, it's only inspired me more to keep pursuing what I love to do.

'I think it's incredibly important to learn and grow from it rather than letting it destroy you and put you off from your dreams and aspirations.

'When people ask me what I do for a living, it almost feels strange to say what I do is work because I enjoy it so much.'
