This is the dramatic moment a mother was pulled to safety by rescuers after she got stuck in a mud trap while out with her two young sons.

The family of three, thought to be from Manchester, were enjoying a holiday in Conwy, North Wales, when they got into difficulty on the seafront.

Onlookers saw the mother, in her 30s, and her two boys, aged eight and ten, begin sinking into the mud, before they were spotted by a member of a nearby lifeboat crew as the sludge rose to their waists.

RNLI crew members then triggered a rescue mission and hauled the family to safety through the mud and back on to dry land on Conwy Quay.

'On Saturday at 6.23pm we got a call to a family who had become stuck in the mud on Conwy Quay,' said a spokesman from Conwy RNLI.

'The family from the Manchester area were spotted by one of the lifeboat crew who was passing at the time.

'The inshore lifeboat was not launched to this incident and the crew proceeded on foot.'

One crew member waded out into the mud and tossed an orange lifebelt to the stranded trio before carrying them to safety.

The spokesman added: 'The three casualties were quickly extracted and taken ashore. They were muddy but otherwise none the worse for their ordeal.

'The crew returned to the lifeboat station at 6.50pm and, after a good hosing down, were ready for immediate response.'
