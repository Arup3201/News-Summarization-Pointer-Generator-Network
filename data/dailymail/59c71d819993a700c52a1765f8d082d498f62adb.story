Force India have followed Williams in unveiling their 2015 Formula One car on Wednesday at an event in Mexico - with drivers Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg revealing the new design.

The new VJM08 model will make its debut at the second pre-season testing in Barcelona next month - sporting a striking new colour scheme.

Made up largely of silver and black shades, the car also has orange flashes along its sides.

Interestingly, Force India - who finished sixth in last season's constructors' championship - have also revealed the car will have new cooling intakes, an updated rear hydro-mechanical suspension system, as well as modified sidepods.

Vijay Mallya, the team principal, said at the launch on Wednesday: 'The 2015 car is a refinement of what we learned in 2014.

'Another major step forward is the technology change, in that we are now using a 60 per cent windtunnel in Cologne, Germany which is a far bigger step than we have ever taken before.

'Traditionally we have been in Brackley, England, where we used to develop our car with a 50 per cent model and an outdated windtunnel.

'With this new and important tool available to use, we hope the 2015 challenger will really prove its worth in competing with the big boys of F1 when we start the European season.

'We are lucky to have two exceptional drivers who will hopefully steer the Sahara Force India challenger to the front of the grid, and hopefully a few podiums during the current year.'
