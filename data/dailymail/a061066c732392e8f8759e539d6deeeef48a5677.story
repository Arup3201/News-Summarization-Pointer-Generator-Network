A couple’s amusing eBay advert for their clapped-out family car has sparked a bidding war resulting in the price of the run-around rocketing to more than £20,000.

Murdo Guy and Camilla Banks, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, decided to take a different approach to selling their beloved banger on the fiercely competitive second-hand market by turning its dents, scratches and dodgy smells into sought-after features.

But the cheeky listing has sent bidders into a frenzy and the price of the silver Mercedes saloon has shot up by tens of thousands of pounds.

In a display of honesty rarely shown by your average second-hand car salesman, Mr Guy wrote on the website: 'If you are looking for an immaculate, well maintained example of a Mercedes e320 CDI...you have come to the wrong place.

'If however, you are low on self-esteem, with a strapped budget, but shooting for the stars, welcome to my auction.'

In more candid sales patter, Mr Guy added: 'Standard Mercedes rust on arches etc. As expected from a vehicle of this fine vintage. Also a couple of dinks from a scrape with Bambi and the missus’s foot.

On the market: Camilla Banks posted this photo of herself alongside the advert for the Mercedes

'As you can see from the photos this car has seen things... things it cannot forget.

'I have owned this car for three years and up to then it had been lovingly cared for and maintained.

'Since owning the vehicle, it has been thrashed, raced, rallied, killed three deer, and the interior has been smashed up in a domestic, not to mention the time my wife booted the wing because I suggested she eat a salad or two (please refer to photo of foot next to dent for reference).

'The car was lovingly cleaned in preparation for the 2012 summer Olympics, and maybe in need of another one now.

The couple's eBay ad for the clapped-out family car has gone viral sparking a bidding war

Rusty: The Mercedes has surprisingly started a bidding war on eBay despite showing signs of wear and tear

Battered: The eBay advert for the rusty Mercedes includes more honest than usual photos and has become an internet hit

Mr Murdo is honest about about the wear and tear his Mercedes, which has 160,000 miles on the clock, has endured.

He wrote: 'As for the bad bits... there are none... just kidding there are lots.

'The CD changer in the boot doesn’t work, but the radio does (we have already preset the channels to suit our clientele).

'The air conditioning isn’t working, but the electric windows do, so bonus. The car smokes when you boot it hard.

'The rear sub frame bushes could probably do with being replaced.'

Spacious: Camilla Banks was even photographed inside the boot of the car to show how big the boot is

Candid: Murdo Guy photographed his partner Camilla Banks posing with the clapped-out Mercedes

He photographed Miss Banks posing with the car in a tongue-in-cheek photo shoot.

Murdo wrote: 'Boot is big enough for two small or one big person. Car sale comes with complementary hostage.'

One prospective buyer wanted to know if there would be space to fit Britain’s Got Talent presenters Ant & Dec in.

Miss Banks said: 'We did want to sell the car but when we were taking pictures of it and we saw how bad it was we thought lets do it in a funny way. Now it’s gone crazy. It was just meant to be a joke.'

However, despite the humorous nature of the advert they requested that only people who were serious about buying should bid - and refunds are not available.
