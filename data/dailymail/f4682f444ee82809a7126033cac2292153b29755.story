This is the first view inside the most gruesome building at a notorious boys reform school in Florida.

The
mausoleum-like building known as the 'White House' at the Dozier School  housed nine barren 
cubicles where boys accused of rule breaking were held.

Cameras were briefly given access before the whole site is declared a crime scene and they captured a series of chilling and eerie images.

Haunting: Boys accused of misbehavior were held in the mausoleum like building at the Florida reform school

Eerie: The unmistakeable bloody hand print on the wall betrays a violent past

Chilling: One boy had written his name and the unexplained note '19 times'

Former students spoke out several 
years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in the White House, at the school in the Florida Panhandle city of Marianna.

MyFoxOrlando showed disturbing footage from inside the prison-like building. One room has a bloody handprint smeared on the painted walls and a number of other stains.

Another room has haunting graffiti with the names of boys who were interred in the school. One marking has the name Ellerbe and an unexplained note of '19 times'

The school was legend among 
adolescents for about 100 years in Florida, as the state's major reform 
school, until it was closed in 2011.

Reminders: One room has several stains from earlier times

Victims: Boys that were held at the Dozier school left their mark behind

Bodies discovered in a once-secret graveyard at the reform school could be now be dug up after calls for federal funding for a forensic investigation into the site.

Dozens of unmarked graves have been found on the property after years of allegations of abuse and children dying in mysterious circumstances. Soon investigators could digging up that past.

Investigators are trying to determine 
the circumstances surrounding the deaths, which experts say probably 
occurred between 1914 and 1952.

State officials have for years 
insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of
the notorious reform school.

Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at 
Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said 
they had found at least 50 graves on the grounds

Scene: Former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House'

Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites

But now, using high-tech search 
equipment, forensic scientists have already found evidence of at least 
another 19 bodies buried under the site - and fear there could be many 
more.

'We really don't know exactly how 
many, or who they are,' said Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist at
the University of South Florida.

She has a scroll-like map of spots 
around the school's grounds where her ground-piercing radar has spotted 
evidence of human remains.

Some boys died under unknown circumstances, according to relatives.

Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys

Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed

Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented

In December, researchers from the 
University of South Florida in Tampa said they found evidence of at 
least 50 graves on the school's property.

In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys.

He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building.

'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.'

He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever.

'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next.

'The thick concrete walls and the loud 
industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they 
were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows 
and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from 
the buttocks.

'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.'

They also found more grave shafts in 
and around an area called 'Boot Hill', which rises across a major 
highway from the high, razor-wire-topped fences of the closed school.

There could be even more victims, but 
researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy 
laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full 
searches.

Dr Kimmerle said: 'All the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue.

'Whether it's one or 20 or 40 or 60, we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information.'

Dozier School was closed in June 2011 
by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy 
over widespread physical and sexual abuse.

Previous investigations and lawsuits 
have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because of the 
name of the squat, whitewashed building where much of the abuse took 
place.

A group of former students sued the 
state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of 
limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their 
experiences.

Following the claims, researchers at 
the University of South Florida in Tampa used ground-penetrating radar 
and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there
than previously reported.

The largest gravesite is on the 
northside of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is 
at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but 
researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites.

'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30
grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of 
anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact 
we found a minimum of 50.'

Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses

Dozier's own records show that more 
than 50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other 
bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried.

But the school failed to record burial
locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the 
site, the Miami Herald reported in December.

Some of the children - and two adults -
died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others 
were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and other state officials are now seeking a court order to allow the remains to be exhumed.

The U.S. Department of Justice has a 
programme that could provide up to $3million for a thorough forensic 
sifting of the burial areas, said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, 
who toured the site yesterday.

A $200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature.

School grounds: Scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves

Ongoing: The U.S. Department of Justice has a programme that could provide up to $3million for a thorough forensic sifting of the burial areas, said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat

Mr Nelson said he wants to find out as
much as possible and let relatives know the truth. He noted that 'the 
statute of limitation on murder never runs out,' but added there is 
little chance of prosecuting anyone.

State Attorney Glenn Hess said only 
one or two employees from the era are known to be alive, and it's 
unlikely a trial could prove how a boy died or who was responsible.

'The question is, can we establish 
probable cause that a crime has been committed, and who did it?' he 
said. 'That's the hard part.'

Families could ask their legislators 
to file 'claims' bills for civil compensation, if identity could be 
established from remains and if negligence might be established on the 
part of the state.
