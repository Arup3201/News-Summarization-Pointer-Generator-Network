They say you should fight fire with fire... and now scientists in Australia are doing exactly that by developing a method of using explosives to help prevent wildfires from raging out of control.

Dr Graham Doig has been investigating the technique which sees the shockwave and subsequent rush of air from
 a controlled explosion knock the flame from its fuel source - just like
 blowing out a candle, but on a much bigger scale.

Dr Doig, of the University of New South Wales, travelled to an explosive test site in a remote part of New Mexico, in the U.S., in a bid to examine how the blast from an explosion can put out fires.

Scientists in Australia are developing a method of using the shockwave from an explosion to put out fires

Australian engineer Dr Graham Doig has been testing the method, which sees the initial shockwave disrupt the flame before the subsequent rush of air knocks it off its fuel source

Within milliseconds of being knocked off the fuel source, the flame is extinguished

He said the method may be able to be 
used to help prevent wildfires from spreading by stopping the flames 
from reaching and taking control of the treetops.

Dr Doig told MailOnline: 'Ideally you want to stop the fire getting into the treetops because that's when it takes control.

'Once
 it moves into the treetops, that is the big problem, so we have been 
thinking in terms of having another tool in the toolbox that 
firefighters can use to get something under control and then get in 
there with water-bombing and firefighters on the ground.

'Conventional
 firefighting needs things under control - if the fire's in the treetops,
 that's when it's most often not under control.'

Dr
 Doig travelled to the Energetic Materials Research Testing Centre where
 he filmed the technique in action using high speed video to investigate
 exactly how it worked.

In a statement he said: 'The sudden 
change in pressure across the shockwave, and then the impulse of the 
airflow behind it pushed the flame straight off the fuel source.

Dr Doig said the method may be able to be used to help prevent wildfires from spreading by stopping the flames from reaching and taking control of the treetops

'As soon as the flame doesn't have access to fuel anymore, it stops burning.'

The
 technique of blowing out a fire has been used in the oil and gas 
industry to put out blazes in wells for a number of years, but Dr Doig 
is now investigating how this technique can be used to tackle fires in open spaces.

He said 
one potential way of using the technique to tackle wildfires would be to 
carry the explosive charge into place by helicopter.

He said: 'Of course as soon as the blast happens you'd want to detach the explosives from the helicopter.

'But helicopter transport would allow you to position the blast somewhere where people couldn't otherwise get in easily.'

Dr Doig said the method was not a 'magic bullet' to defeat wildfires, but he hoped it could be a way of preventing them becoming out of control and to aid more conventional firefighting techniques.
