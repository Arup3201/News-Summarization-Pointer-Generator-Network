A dog that was tied to railroad tracks and repeatedly shot is expected to make a full recovery after having her injured leg amputated.  

Police in Florida stopped an oncoming train to rescue a dog that had been shot three times and lashed to the railway tracks with a belt.

Officers received three calls around 523pm Wednesday from people reporting hearing gunshots. Then they heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks. 

Horrific: Police arrived at the scene to discover the dog (pictured) had been shot three times and tied to the railway tracks with a belt

Survivor: The young pit bull mix, dubbed Cabela, suffered injuries were so severe her front-right leg (right) will have to be amputated

On the mend: Cabela, pictured here resting at Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, is said to be stable and in good spirits 

They discovered the blood-spattered pup, nicknamed Cabela, had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder.

Her injuries were so severe that the dog's front right leg needs to be amputated in the next few days.

Authorities are now asking for the public's help to find the thug who mercilessly left the animal for dead in the Sulphur Springs area.

Officers freed the one to two-year-old female from the tracks and immediately took it to they Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where it remains in a stable condition. 

'It's very calm and relaxed and just in recovery mode at this point,' said Officer Derek Lang, a police spokesman. 

A staffer who answered the phone at the clinic Thursday evening told Daily Mail Cabela is in stable condition and 'in good spirits.'  

New life: Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption

She is currently under the care of Dr Jamie Davidson, who says Cabela is sweet with a good temperament, despite what she's gone through. 

Police have said they do not know who tied Cabela to the track and asked the public for any information to track down the culprit or the dog's owner.

Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.
