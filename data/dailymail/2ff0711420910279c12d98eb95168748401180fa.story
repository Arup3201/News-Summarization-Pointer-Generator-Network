A pair of thieves attempting to rob a jeweller's by tunneling through a wall, ended up at the next door KFC in Beudesert, Australia.

The two thieves had broken into a toilet block behind the building shared by the jeweller's shop and the fast-food restaurant and used an iron bar to create a hole in the wall, but suffered some miscalculations.

Although the pair missed their original target, they staged an impromptu hold-up and escaped with about £1,000 in cash.

Botched: The shop that was supposed to be robbed... and the KFC the crooks ended up stealing from

But they didn’t have much time to spend it – Queensland police caught the pair, Peter Welsh, 32, and Dwayne Doolan, 31, shortly after their hoist and they have now appeared in court on the Gold Coast.

The Southport Magistrates Court was told the KFC robbery was the pair's third attempt to break in to the jewellery store on New Year’s Eve.

Attempt number one entailed throwing spark plugs at the jeweller’s window in the hope of smashing it, but that ended in failure.

Next they tried to break in through the rear doors, but instead found themselves in the neighbouring Animal Welfare League Opportunity Shop, the Courier Mail newspaper reported.

The third attempt involved more hard work.

Making the 'best' of it: The robbing pair hacked through the wall using an iron bar but missed their original target and proceeded to rob the KFC instead

Police claim the pair broke into a toilet block at the rear of the line of shops and used an iron bar to hack a hole in the wall, creating a small tunnel through which they crawled.

Expecting to find themselves in the jewellery store at last, they found themselves surrounded by fast food.

They threatened staff with the iron bar and grabbed money from a safe.

But police tracked them down and, Sgt Damian Summerfield told the court, Welsh made ‘full and frank’ admissions.

Welsh has been charged with armed robbery, stealing, burglary and attempted burglary. Doolan has been charged with robbery and stealing.

Welsh was refused bail, while police did not oppose it for Doolan.

The men are due to return to court in March.
