No one likes warm beer, or having to wait around for it to be chilled.

But a new gadget now claims to be able to transform your warm drink into a refreshing beverage within seconds.

The Rapidcool device claims to cool drink cans and bottles from room temperature to 4°C in under 45 seconds.

The product, designed by London-based Enviro-Cool, has received £760,000  in European Union research funding.

The investment is based on the product’s potential to significantly reduce energy requirements in supermarket cooler aisles.

The inventors hope the device will allow shoppers to choose a drink from a supermarket shelf, place it into the Rapidcool machine and get it back chilled without waiting around.

The gadget uses patented V-Tex technology that rotates the drink at a certain speed. This, according to the company, mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened

Across Europe, combined commercial refrigerator and freezers are estimated to consume 85TWh of electricity per annum, equivalent to the energy required to power over 20 million households.

Rapidcool claims to provide energy savings of over 80 per cent compared with some standard open front drinks chillers and a 54 per cent saving compared with glass door coolers.

Previous efforts have been made to achieve rapid drinks cooling on demand.

The problem has always been the time it takes to effectively cool the liquid. If the cooling is very fast then the outer layers of liquid freeze before the inner liquid is cooled creating ‘slushing.’

The gadget uses patented V-Tex technology by rotating the drink at a certain speed to create a something known as the ‘Rankine vortex’.

This, according to the company, mixes carbonated drinks but avoids fizzing when the drink is opened.

Although designed to work as a stand-alone unit, the cooling chamber can also be integrated into existing self-serve chillers.

The group estimates that the average saving on electricity costs could be equal to £700 for each replaced fridge per year.
