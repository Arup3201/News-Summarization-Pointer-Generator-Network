White Dee is facing calls for her to be stripped of her sickness benefits after she admitted using her notoriety to earn money from promotional work.

The reality TV star – real name Deirdre Kelly – defiantly insisted, ‘I’m not doing anything wrong’ and said she would continue taking state handouts until the Prime Minister or his government stops her.

The 42-year-old star of the controversial Channel 4 show Benefits Street has repeatedly claimed that she is too depressed to work.

Earning power: Benefits Street star White Dee has revealed that she is earning money from her new found fame while continuing to claim Government handouts

Jaunt: White Dee during her recent trip to Magaluf. She said the shots she was seen downing were water

But this weekend the mother of two, 
whose handouts equate to the take-home pay of someone earning £20,000 a 
year, admitted cashing in on her growing celebrity status and enjoying 
the high life through a string of appearances and promotional work.

She
 was pictured partying in Magaluf in Majorca and enjoying a steak dinner
 at a top restaurant. Miss Kelly, who was diagnosed with depression, 
gets £214 a week from a combination of Employment and Support Allowance –
 formerly known as Sickness Benefit – Child Tax Credit and Child 
Benefit, plus £500 a month Housing Benefit.

Up front: The mother-of-two, whose real name is Deirdre Kelly, said she is declaring all her earnings to the authorities

‘If people have a problem with how much I am getting, they should speak to David Cameron,’ she said.

Her
 last full-time job was at Birmingham council. She was fired in 2007 – 
and narrowly avoided a jail sentence – for stealing £13,000.

Last
 night Conservative MP Philip Davies called on the Department for Work 
and Pensions (DWP) to investigate her case. ‘I think she epitomises 
everything that’s wrong with our benefits system,’ he said.

Following
 the popularity of Benefits Street, which showed the lives of families 
on James Turner Street in Birmingham, Miss Kelly has had at least six 
offers to front programmes, including one for a cookery show in France.

She has done promotional work abroad, made a rap record and been DJing at nightclubs in Birmingham.

She
 has dined out at the city’s upmarket Malmaison hotel brasserie and is 
reported to have agreed a big-money deal to appear on the next Celebrity
 Big Brother. Miss Kelly told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Yes, I am taking 
casual work. I won’t tell you how much I am earning but it’s not half as
 much as people think.’

Speaking
 of a promotional trip to Magaluf earlier this month, she said: ‘I met a
 lot of nice people but it can be hard trying to smile all the time when
 you’re not in the mood for it. I missed my kids.’

In
 exchange for the break, she says, she agreed to be the special guest at
 a pool party, judge a wet T-shirt contest and go on a bar crawl to 
promote a travel firm.

Earlier this year Ms Kelly was sent on a date by a third party to the four-star Malmaison Hotel in Birmingham

Despite being on benefits, Ms Kelly dined out at the brassiere restaurant where main courses cost up to £20

But she said: ‘The pool party was not really my scene and I don’t drink, so the bar crawl was not my thing either.’

She said the shot glasses she was photographed downing were filled with water.

‘I
 wouldn’t say I was miserable, but that doesn’t mean I am not depressed.
 I’m on sickness benefit and trying to get back into full-time work. 

Background: During Benefits Street, Dee said she had suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and bad days' with the condition

‘Do I have to stop claiming benefits because I spent two days in Majorca?

‘Would people be less upset if I went to Skegness?’

Miss
 Kelly’s agent Barry Tomes said yesterday that not all the work she has 
done has been paid, and any payment she has received is declared to the 
relevant authorities.

The 
DWP said it would not discuss individual claimants but added: ‘Where 
there is evidence of benefit fraud, we would not hesitate to 
investigate.’ 

People are entitled to claim  Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if their illness or disability affects their ability to work provided they are aged under 65 and not receiving Statutory Sick Pay,  Statutory Maternity Pay or Jobseeker’s Allowance. 

The handouts are designed to help people back into the world of work, and it is possible to apply for ESA if you’re employed, self-employed, unemployed or a student on Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment.

To get ESA, claimants usually have to prove they cannot work by sending in medical certificates to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

Receipt of ESA is usually not affected if the person claiming works less than 16 house a week and earns less than £101 a week for up to a year, but if this limit is reached then the money may be withdrawn or reduced. 

The DWP must be notified of any change of circumstances, including if volunteer work is being carried out, and failure to do so may result in a claimant being investigated by the DWP, or even prosecuted for fraud.
