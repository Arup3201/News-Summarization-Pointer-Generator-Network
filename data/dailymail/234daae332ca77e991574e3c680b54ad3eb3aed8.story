When it got down to the real nitty-gritty after England’s training session in the Sun Life Stadium, Roy Hodgson just couldn’t commit.

The brutal truth is that the country’s head coach just isn’t mad about Wayne Rooney any more.

Hodgson went as far as to say that the England striker, with 90 caps and 38 goals, is ‘a useful player’, but wouldn’t go any further. Something has gone awry here. Again. Hodgson hinted heavily at a switch to left wing for Rooney and he was trialled in the position in a series of drills during their 90-minute training session.

The trust, to play him in the hole, the No 10 position favoured by Rooney, just isn’t there.

‘I’m not saying if he’s exceptional or not,’ said Hodgson. ‘I have picked him because he is a very good player.

‘If I say yes he is exceptional or no I don’t think he’s exceptional I’m wrong either way. He’s a football player.’

This was tetchy, the kind of performance you would expect of England’s head coach when something is troubling him.

‘I decide how I want to use Wayne Rooney,’ he added. ‘There is an obsession with Wayne Rooney which I don’t really share.

‘He
 can play centre forward, behind the centre forward and wide.

'If he’s 
done all that with Manchester United there is no reason why I can’t use 
him in those positions as well.

'I look at the players at my disposal and
 decide what they need and what we need. Then I expect them to do it.’

It was a brutal assessment and it will be fascinating to see how Rooney handles it today when he is pressed into action.

No-one
 would deny that Rooney, the only survivor from Friday’s disciplined 3-0
 victory over Peru at Wembley, needs games. The issue, as ever, is where
 he plays.

He
 has repeated, many times over, that his favoured role for club and 
country is behind the main striker. It is no longer in his hands.

Rooney did OK against Peru, a steady six out of 10 playing behind Daniel Sturridge in an overall decent, effective performance.

‘The
 thinking behind Wayne starting a second game is that he only played 60 
minutes against Peru,’ added Hodgson. ‘He’s recovering his match 
fitness. It will be to his advantage to play another game.’

There are some other alarming features about this England team, notably the deployment of James Milner at right back today.

You
 have to feel for Milner because he was exceptional in Manchester City’s
 midfield during their title run-in. He is not the type to make a fuss 
and there will be no complaints from him, but he didn’t get picked to 
play right back for England. He deserves some sympathy.

‘He’s
 got the qualities to play there and there may be moments at the World 
Cup when we would like to use him there,’ said Hodgson. ‘He’s in the 
squad as a midfield player and that’s where we see him mostly, but it 
will be interesting to see how he gets on at right back.’

Hodgson is sticking with his settled 4-2-3-1 formation, but he has made 10 changes to the team for the clash with Ecuador.

He
 insists the absence of Raheem Sterling from his starting line-up is no 
cause for alarm, despite what Hodgson described as ‘a clamour’ for him 
to be named in the team.

There
 was an energy about Sterling’s performance when he came on as a 
substitute on Friday and he lifted the Wembley crowd with a fearless 
performance.

‘If I concentrate on where the clamour is I would be changing my team every minute,’ said Hodgson.

‘You don’t have to have any doubts about how we feel about Raheem Sterling. We feel he’s an exceptional player.’

There’s that word again — the one Hodgson couldn’t quite stretch to when it turned to Rooney.Sterling
 should be among the substitutes today as Hodgson takes a closer look at
 some of his alternatives in this 25-man squad on the United States leg.
 Ross Barkley is expected to play off Liverpool’s new striker Rickie 
Lambert. It feels like a decent fit.

‘They will get their chance to show what they can do,’ said Hodgson. ‘Barkley’s here because I think he’s a very good player.

‘He’s more than capable, if selected for England, of doing a very good job for us.’

This is a big chance for the shadow squad to impress. After that, though, Rooney is the man who really is on trial.
