A Venezuelan-owned oil company caused outrage this week after flying flags at half-mast at its American office after the death of Hugo Chavez.

Citgo, which is owned by the Venezuelan government, lowered its flags as a tribute to the late President, incensing residents in Houston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, who said they were offended by the gesture.

Protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries, but Chavez was a controversial leader who as was antagonistic towards the U.S.

Jarring: The Citgo flags at half mast to honor President Hugo Chavez in Houston, Texas

Protocol allows flags to be lowered for foreign dignitaries, but Hugo Chavez was a contentious leader and often seen as antagonistic towards the U.S. in particular.

James Post, an assistant project manager at an engineering and construction firm, told Fox News that it was 'jarring' and 'deeply disappointing'.

Post said that his mind 'immediately jumped to the last time we did this in the Houston-area and it was for Neil Armstrong.'

Terry Backhaus, a financial adviser in Louisiana, said that the flags at the Citgo refinery in Lake Charles had been raised back by noon.Â 

'I think I used a profanity when I saw it this morning, I was disgusted,' Bakhaus said.

'I didn't believe it to be right, not for somebody who wasn't a true American ally.'

At one point Mr Chavez even blamed the U.S. government for his cancer.

Chavez suggested in 2011 that the U.S. might have 'invented technology to spread cancer', and warned other left-wing heads of state that they could be targeted next.

His comments came after Argentina's Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the fifth South American president to contract the disease.

Chavez's anti-American sentiment culminated in a particularly ill-judged joke when president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to visit Venezuela last year.

Ahmadinejad and Chavez mocked the U.S. and joked about directing 'a big atomic bomb' at Washington.

Courting Ahmadinejad was part of an overriding policy of befriending rivals of the United States throughout his 14-year rule.

Iran, with whom he had close ties, immediately declared a day of mourning for its former ally who 'loathed U.S imperialism'.

Citgo released a statement saying that Chavez 'leaves behind a legacy of support for the underprivileged and promotion of social justice that transcends geographical boundaries.'

They did not explain the flag lowering 
directly but said: 'We at CITGO Petroleum Corporation are deeply 
saddened by the news of his passing.'

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Venezuela in this time of grief.'

Chavez, who was 58, died after a two-year cancer battle that has been shrouded in secrecy.

His death was also mysterious as claims emerged that he died in a Cuban hospital instead of a military hospital in Venezuela's capital, Caracas.

Chavez will lie in state until his funeral on Friday.

The vote for a new president should be held within 30 days and will probably pit the socialist vice president Nicolas Maduro against Henrique Capriles, the centrist leader and state governor who lost to Chavez in the October.
