Apple's next iPhone could go on sale in the summer, it has been claimed.

Sources close to the electronics giant say the handset, expected to be a speed-boosted version of the current iPhone 5 with new software, will begin production within weeks and go on sale in the summer.

This will break with Apple's traditional autumn unveiling of a new handset, and is likely to pave the way for a lower cost iPhone to be revealed later in the year.

Customers queue up to purchase the iPhone 5 smartphone at the Apple flagship store on George street in Sydney, Australia. The firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer.

Apple's next two iPhones had already been designed before Steve Jobs died in October 2011, it has been claimed.

At a meeting with the San Francisco district attorney, George Gascón, who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region, Apple's liaison officer Michael Foulkes is reported by the San Francisco Examiner to have said the designs for the next two phones 'preceded Tim Cook [being chief executive]'.

The 
new model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but 
include a faster processor and updated camera, according to online 
reports.

It will also run iOS 7, a major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software being overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive.

'Apple plans to begin production of a refreshed iPhone similar in size and shape to its current one in the second quarter of the year, according to people familiar with the device's production, teeing up a possible summer launch for the next version of its flagship device,' claims the Wall Street Journal.

'At the same time, Apple continues to work with its manufacturing partners in Asia on a less expensive iPhone that could be launched as soon as the second half of this year, these people said.'

The report is in line with the expectations of company watchers and Wall Street analysts.

The iPhone 5 costs around $600 in the US, and while Apple maintains older iPhones in production, even those aren't cheap enough to compete effectively against low-end smartphones running Google Inc.'s Android software. 

Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events.

Earlier this year it was claimed the iPhone 5S will be revealed in April and go on sale in August.

It
also claims that new iPad models are set to be announced in April, 
including a new version of the firm's hugely successful iPad Mini with 
an upgraded screen.

'iMore has learned that Apple is planning the release of the iPhone 5S for this summer, currently for August,' the site said.

'Next generation iPads, presumably the iPad 5 and potentially the iPad mini 2, may also debut as soon as this April,' it added.

'If these plans stick, we should be in for a fun spring and summer.'

It
comes as Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara reported that Foxconn is 
starting to ramp up production of Apple's iPhone 5 successor, according 
to AppleInsider. 

It
claims that because the design of the 'iPhone 5S' is substantially the 
same as the company's existing handset, little to no tooling is needed 
to manufacture the two models on the same production lines.

The claims echo those made by Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries earlier this year, who said Apple will begin making a new iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July.

Mr
Misek predicted that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers 
anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he 
expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to March.

'As
word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we
could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new 
product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel 
inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider.

'Therefore
we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which 
is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.'

The
analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a 
reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the 
new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life.

On
rumours of an entry-level iPhone, Mr Misek claimed Apple could release a
low-cost device made of polycarbonate with no 4G Long Term Evolution 
(LTE) capability.

The
speculation seemed to contradict comments made by Phil Schiller, 
Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the 
Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones,
this well never be the future of Apple's products.'
