The moment Google launched hotly-awaited camera spectacles 'Glass', technocrats across the world queued up to give their review online.

But when one father put the device through the ultimate trial and tested it on his toddler, the adorable youngster gave a verdict that was rather open to interpretation.

Chris Angelini's son, Lucas, appears to love the wearable computer at first as he totters about the family home, in Bakersfield, California, repeating: 'Look at my cool glasses.'

But two minutes into the trial the two-year-old takes them off and hands them back, saying: 'I'm done... they're hot.'

Scroll down for the adorable video.

Toddler test: Chris Angelini said he put the Google Glass on his son, Lucas, two, for a joke and to make his wife laugh

Making juice: Lucas appears to love the wearable computer as he totters about the family home, in Bakersfield, California, repeating: 'Look at my cool glasses.'

It is unclear whether the boy used the word 'hot' as a slang term for 'cool', or if he actually meant the high-tech headgear was heating up his little face.

The contraption is fitted with a wireless cellular radio to stay connected to the internet at all times to deliver search results, provide turn-by-turn 
directions, and upload images.

But such radios have come under fire for emitting potentially harmful electromagnetic radiation that could heat up in a similar way to mobile phones after uninterrupted use.

Nevertheless, despite the brief time Lucas had the headset on, it appeared to work and provided an adorable 
insight into a world seen through the eyes of a toddler.

Angelini, who runs technology review website Tomshardware.com, posted the video on YouTube, where he wrote: 'As I was testing Google Glass, my two-year-old wanted to know what I was
doing (almost as much as he wanted some juice). So, I indulged him. The
result was really pretty cute.'

Child's eye view: Lucas drinks the juice in the cute video

Hello mummy: They then move into the living room where to see his mother and play with toys before the little boy brings the trial to its abrupt end

Play area: In the two-minute video, Lucas shows his father his toys in the living of their spacious home

Adorably astute: But in the end, Lucas appears to tire of the glasses, saying: 'I'm done... they're hot'

The boy first joins his father in the kitchen where they prepare an apple juice with ice.

They then move into the living room where to see his mother and play with toys before the little boy brings the trial to its abrupt end.

In a review of the gadget on his website, Angelini says: 'There’s something to be said for playing with your kid and recording it,
rather than watching him run around, passively, through a smartphone 
camera (50 minutes of video at a time, that is).

How Google Glass Works

'And if you want a 
different perspective, try turning the tables. I did it as a joke (and 
because I figured my wife would find it cute). Turns out it's actually 
pretty cool to get reminded what everything looks like from half my 
height.'

He adds: 'Glass is going to be a great way for parents to memorialize a lot of 
firsts without managing birthday parties, juggling Christmas presents, 
or trying to steady those first few steps while glancing over at a 
camera screen.

'This puts the moment in point-of-view, and it doesn’t 
create a spectator out of you. You remain a participant in life, and you get the tape when the action is over.'
