This is the moment a hungry mongoose was sent running for his life after trying to capture an adder.

The feline prowling South Africa's barren desert crept towards the unsuspecting reptile as it lay curled up in the sand.

But just inches away, his dinner fought back, baring its venomous fangs.

Petrified, the attempted attacker leaped into the air and bounded away to his companion.

It is a rare moment of prey trumping predator in Africa's harsh and wild animal kingdom.

Pounce: The yellow mongoose, normally prey for big snakes, is sent running after trying to grab this adder

Amateur wildlife photographer Hennie Lacock was having a picnic with his wife when they saw the fight about to break out.

But he was stunned when he actually 
managed to capture the exact moment dinner decided to fight back - and 
the mongoose fled empty handed.

The stunning photo shows both animals mid-pounce - although both eventually escaped unharmed.

Although its cousin, the Indian Grey, is
famed for being able to single-handedly kill and eat lethal cobras, 
this species is not famed for its hunting.

This mongoose had been circling Mr Hancock's table with a pack of companions on the hunt for crumbs.

However, they all fled in one moment after catching sight of the puff adder.

Mr Lacock said: 'Suddenly their 
attention was not on our fried eggs and bacon anymore, and the group of 
mongoose rushed over to the other side of the gravel road with real 
purpose in their stride - something was up.

Confident: Finally ready to go it alone, it seems like the cost is clear, with the reptile lying still in the sand

'All the yellow mongoose were gathering in a circle, snarling, yapping and biting at something.

'I rushed to grab my camera to capture some of the action.

'The yellow mongoose kept crawling up to the puff adder, launching into attack mode, but then retreating back as fast as anything as the puff adder struck back from his coiled position.

'This went on for quite a while as the puff adder made his way into the dirt road. It was time for us to leave when I told my wife: "Just a couple more shots!"

'By now there was only one yellow mongoose harassing the snake. As I was about to take my final shot, the Puff Adder launched at the one remaining mongoose one final time with brilliant speed.

'I was lucky enough to take the picture at just the right time to capture the moment, catching the Yellow Mongoose as it jumps away from the puff adder's venomous fangs, and the puff adder pressing hard against the sand for traction to strike out as fast as possible.

'It was an amazing moment to capture and one I will treasure forever.'

Hungry: They hung around photographer Hennie Lacock's wife, Kirsten, as she ate before going for the snake

Small: The Yellow Mongoose species is not famed for hunting, unlike the Indian Gray which can kill cobras

Sometimes referred to as a red meerkat, it is a small creature - growing up to half a kilogram in weight and 20 inches in height at most.

They are carnivorous, feeding off eggs, small snakes, and lizards - but bigger snakes and birds of prey are their predators.

Meanwhile adders, found everywhere from Richmond Park in London to the outback of Australia, can be highly dangerous to anyone that comes into contact with them.

The only deadly snake to live in Britain, they have the most highly developed venom-injecting mechanism of all snakes worldwide.

Normally not aggressive, animals that leave them alone do not have to live in fear.

But when attacked, few predators will get away scot-free.
