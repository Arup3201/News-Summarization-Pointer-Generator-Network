Roberto Martinez has branded Everton’s current position in the Barclays Premier League ‘unacceptable’ but he has no intention of sacrificing their European dream.

Everton have slithered onto the fringes of the relegation fight after only winning one league game in 2015 and they face crucial fixtures against Newcastle and Queens Park Rangers before the international break.

Martinez accepts his position will be the subject of intense focus until results improve but he is refusing to panic.

The manager is confident a big performance against Dynamo Kiev, coached by former Tottenham striker Sergei Rebrov, on Thursday night will be the catalyst for a sustained improvement over the final 10 games of the domestic campaign.

Martinez said: ‘I know the severity of the situation and about not having margin for error. I have been brought up with it. I don’t think that is a problem. For us as a football club, the position we are in is unacceptable.

‘At the end of the season, we need to look at why it has happened. But for the time being, we need to show a real desire to win.

He added: ‘I don’t look to blame anyone. Football is a game of errors and the responsibility is mine. I will always accept that. I am not going to change now. The team is performing in a manner that we should have got more points. But the reality is we have got 28 points. Now every game is a final.’

Everton have been formidable in Europe this season and have won five of their eight matches and Martinez said: ‘In the Europa League, I think we have had an opportunity to show what we can do.

'We have played top teams but we have gone eye-to-eye with them. In the Premier League, everything that could go wrong, goes wrong.’
