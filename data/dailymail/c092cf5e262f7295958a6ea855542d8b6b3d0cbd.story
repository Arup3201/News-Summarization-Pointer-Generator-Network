Dramatic new footage has emerged of the moment passengers cowered in terror as a giant Boeing 767 was forced into an emergency landing.

The aeroplane carrying 230 people suffered catastrophic equipment failure while flying from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw, Poland, in November 2011.

The pilot was forced to bring it in to land at Warsaw airport with no wheels after all its landing gear failed and the aircraft skidded along the tarmac on its belly.

Passengers aboard LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 prepared for the worst after being told that their plane would make an emergency landing

The passengers' terrifying ordeal on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16 was caught on tape

Sparks flew and a fire broke out in the starboard engine before it came to a halt. But, incredibly, nobody on the flight was injured.

Eighteen months on and footage has emerged from inside the cabin as the plane hit the runway. Terrified passengers had been fully aware there was a major problem and the aircraft was in trouble.

American business class passenger told MSNBC's Rock Center with Brian Williams he texted his wife Michelle to tell her there was a problem and that he loved her.

He told her: 'We're making an emergency landing, I think we will be OK. I love you and thank God for you and our children. I am sorry to text you this but I love you so much.'

As the situation unfolded emergency services were waiting at the 
end of the runway to deal with any potential disaster, while two F-16 fighter jets escorted it to the ground.

The pilot had radioed 
ahead to let the control tower know there was a problem with deploying 
the landing gear. After several attempts, however, it was decided that 
the aircraft would have to come down without any wheels.

Terrifying touch down: The Boeing 767 hits the ground in Warsaw on its belly after a catastrophic failure of all its landing gear

Drama: Flames and sparks burst from the aircraft as it slides along the ground without any means of braking

Rescue: Fire engines spray fire retardant foam on the LOT Polish airlines plane after it comes to a standstill. Astonishingly none of the 230 people on board were injured

Miraculous: Passengers escaped down the plane's emergency chutes after the landing at Warsaw. No one was injured

Safe landing: The Boeing 767 came down on foam sprayed on the tarmac in an attempt to dampen any fires that broke out

While the plane circled 
the Polish capital for an hour, dumping excess fuel and repeatedly 
trying to solve the problem, ground crews prepared for a crash landing, 
closing the airport to all other flights and clearing nearby streets.

Waiting fire crews also sprayed the runway with foam in a bid to prevent a fire 
from breaking out.

The
pilot lifted the nose of the aircraft slightly as it approached the 
tarmac. As it slid along the runway, smoke billowed from the 
undercarriage followed by bright flashes from under the engines.

Relief: Passengers from the Boeing 767 were confronted with a media scrum as they disembarked the plane following an horrendous ordeal

Traumatised passengers did not want to speak to reporters as they tried to leave the airport but others relived their ordeal for the news crews

When
it came to a halt, fire engines that were waiting along the sides and 
at the end of the tarmac rushed towards the plane, dowsing it with foam.
Meanwhile, passengers were quickly taken off down the inflatable chutes
on either side.

News
channels and TV crews were on the scene soon after learning about the 
emergency and the incredible landing was beamed live around the world.

The captain, Tadeusz Wrona, was been hailed a hero by Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowsk, as well as by the airport staff and the Polish media.

LOT airlines president, 
Marcin Pirog, said that Captain Tadeusz Wrona and co-pilot 
Jerzy Szwartz carried out a 'perfect emergency landing,' which prevented
anyone from being injured.

Poland's President Bronislaw Komorowski congratulated and thanked the crew and emergency workers for ensuring no one was hurt.

'I thank everyone with my whole heart in the name of Poland,' said Komorowski.
