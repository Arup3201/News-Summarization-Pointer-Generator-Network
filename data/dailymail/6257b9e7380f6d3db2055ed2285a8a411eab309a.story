Andy Murray is known for his stern face and tough demeanor and it seems even a belly dancer can't raise a smile from the Wimbledon champion. 

Attending a players' dinner at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships Murray looked unimpressed as the pretty woman pranced around him. 

Although he did turn to look at her at one point there was not even a flicker of a grin on his face.

The 27-year-old appeared to be there on his own as fiancee Kim Sears was nowhere in sight.

Murray is in Dubai to take part in the championships and won his first-round tie against Luxembourg's Gilles Muller on Tuesday.

Murray said of the victory: 'I made him work very hard on his service games. That was something I wanted to try to do from early on.

'The end of both sets I didn't serve so well but apart from that, I didn't give him any opportunities really.' 

On Wednesday, the Scot made short work of Joao Sousa once again to race into the quarter-finals of the tournament  with a 6-0, 6-2 win.

Last month. as Murray took on Czech player Tomas Berdych in the Australian Open semi final Miss Sears was seen calling him a, 'Czech Flash F***.'

However, she poked fun at herself the next day when she rocked up to Andy's next game in a jumper which read: 'Parental Advisory, Explicit Content.'  

Murray later defended Sears' actions saying in an interview that she had been 'whipped up,' by the media storm surrounding his match.

The day after being caught on camera swearing during one of Andy's tennis matches Kim was spotted wearing this parental advisory jumper 

Murray said at the time: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.'

He added: 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' 

It was recently confirmed that Murray and Kim have set the date for their wedding as April 11.

They will wed in an intimate ceremony at Cromlix House, a hotel in Scotland owned by Murray himself.
