Chad Brown, 21, allegedly stabbed another inmate with a pen

A 21-year-old man who was taken to a holding cell for allegedly attacking his sister then proceeded to stab another detainee in the neck with a pen, according to police.

The attack unfolded just before 10 a.m. Monday in the holding area at the Chittenden Superior Court in Burlington, Vermont.

Chad Brown, who had been charged the day before with stabbing a woman and injuring two police officers, was shackled to a 48-year-old man and using a pen to fill out paperwork when he lunged, driving the pen into the man's neck and narrowly missing vital arteries and veins, Burlington police said.

Brown continued the attack until the man picked up a chair to defend himself and sheriff's deputies entered the room.

Police expect to charge Brown on Tuesday with attempted murder.

The victim was treated and released from a hospital - the injury missed vital arteries and veins

Brown was in court following an attack Sunday in which police said he stabbed a female relative.

When police arrived at the house, he fled into some nearby woods where he was ultimately captured by officers using a dog.

Two officers were injured and the woman suffered multiple cuts on her torso.

Brown was charged with first-degree aggravated domestic assault.

It could not immediately be determined if Brown had a lawyer.
