Mistakes by NHS staff are  to blame for the death or significant harm of 250 patients a day, figures show.

In just six months there were 45,476 errors with such serious consequences, including incorrect diagnosis and patients given the wrong treatment or drug.

Of these, 1,958 led to death and 43,518 resulted in significant harm.

NHS hospitals have been told to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided. These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis and surgery in the wrong area.

When near misses are also taken into account, the data from NHS England shows there was a total of 725,314 safety incidents between April and September 2013, though the majority were very minor.

The figure is nine per cent higher than the previous six months.

Officials said this is because staff are being more honest – not that care has got worse.

But campaigners said the findings were probably an underestimate as many trusts still do not own up to every mistake.

Since 2010 all NHS hospitals have been obliged to report to the Care Quality Commission any incidents in which a patient comes to harm or the harm is only narrowly avoided.

These include pressure sores, medication overdoses, false diagnosis, surgery in the wrong area or treatment being given too slowly.

But in the past some staff have not owned up to such mistakes for fear of legal action by patients or relatives.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans in March for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years

Peter Walsh, of charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said: ‘These figures are a timely reminder that there is an awful long way to go.

‘It is surprising how much error actually happens.

'Most experts believe that there is still very significant under-reporting so the real figures are probably worse.’

He said that studies had estimated that as many as one in ten patients admitted to hospital were involved in a patient safety incident, although this included other Western countries.

‘We need to get the culture right and have a regulation system that’s fit for purpose,’ he said.

In March health secretary Jeremy Hunt announced plans for hospitals to improve their safety in the hope that it could save 6,000 lives over the next three years.

They include closer monitoring of hospitals as well the recruitment of extra staff specifically tasked with cutting down on harm.

Dr Mike Durkin, NHS England’s director of patient safety, said it was ‘hugely encouraging’ that more incidents were being reported as it showed staff were ‘increasingly comfortable with speaking openly about mistakes and learning from error’.
