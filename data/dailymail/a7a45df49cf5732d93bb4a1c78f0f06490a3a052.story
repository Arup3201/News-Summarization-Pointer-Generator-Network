Kevin Pietersen has risked further overshadowing England's preparations for next month's World Cup by claiming they'd 'love' him in their squad.

The 34-year-old was unceremoniously sacked by the national side last year after a spate of public run-ins with the management and players.

Pietersen said in his autobiography – published in 2014 – that there had been a bullying culture inside the England dressing room, throwing particular ire towards Matt Prior.

But he has since attempted to flirt with the new regime in a bid to regain a place in the squad at both Test and ODI level.

That continued apace on Tuesday when, during a conversation with Ricky Ponting while commentating on the Big Bash, he suggested England captain Eoin Morgan wants him in the team for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

'I don't know why I'm not playing for England,' he said. 'I know the current England captain (Morgan) would love me in the side.

'I was sacked - P45. I get on pretty well with most of the guys in there, if not all of them.

'I don't see why (I couldn't play again).'

If the call came - only an injury could lead to that, because the final squads for all 14 competing countries have already been announced - Pietersen would still answer it.

'I want to play for England,' he said.

'If I get the opportunity to play for England ... I'm 34 years of age, Kumar Sangakkara is 38 and has just scored a double hundred.

'I honestly believe I'm batting as well as I've ever batted.

'I've got over my knee injury, which was huge - over the last 18 months, I'd just hated batting because my knee has been so sore.

'Given half an opportunity to go and play the way I'm playing at the moment, of course I would.' 

Pietersen is hoping to get back into both the England ODI and Test teams

Pietersen's assertions come after Alastair Cook was relieved of his duties as one-day captain in December.

The South African-born batsman was typically outspoken in his criticism of Cook and now wants back in.

And he may have an ally in Stuart Broad, who couldn't understand the way in which Pietersen was sacked after the Ashes humiliation last winter.

'I just think the sacking became a media uproar,' Broad told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.

'It just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player gets dropped for poor form, don't they?'

But that is highly unlikely to happen, given the stress his words have put the England team under coupled with consistent poor form.

England's first World Cup game is against Australia on February 14, with a warm-up triangular series against the hosts and India this month.
