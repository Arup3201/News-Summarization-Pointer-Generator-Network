New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton not only has run afoul of the law over weapons possession, but he also landed in trouble with his wife over allegations of constant infidelities.

The ball player was arraigned on two felony weapons possession charges in Manhattan Criminal Court Tuesday and then released on $25,000 bail following an early morning weapons possession arrest.

Earlier Felton turned himself in to authorities after a lawyer for his estranged wife of only 19 months turned in a loaded semi-automatic handgun allegedly belonging to the Knicks star to a police precinct, claiming she no longer wanted it in their home.

Not sweating it? New York Knicks point guard Raymond Felton appeared largely upbeat at his Manhattan arraignment Tuesday alongside one of his attorneys

Law enforcement sources told the New 
York Post that Ariane Raymondo-Felton, the 24-year-old brunette beauty 
who walked down the aisle with the athlete in 2012, told police that 
Felton had been juggling several paramours on the side.

‘He's an NBA player. He flirts and stuff,’ a source said. ‘When you're in a position like that you could get 10 girls per week.’

Raymondo-Felton,
 who is a student at the prestigious Fordham Law School, also told 
police that she and her philandering husband had four fights since the 
summer, and on two occasions Felton pulled his FNH Five-Seven 28mm 
handgun on her.

The final altercation between the newlyweds came on Valentine's Day, which erupted over domestic problems.

During
 the fight, Felton’s wife claimed that the 29-year-old star athlete 
brandished the gun in front of her to 'intimidate' her, the woman later 
told police.

Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce four days after the confrontation with her husband.

The
 law student's attorney advised her to turn over her husband's 
unregistered handgun, which Felton had been keeping under their bed in 
the couple's apartment on West 63rd Street.

Rumors
 of Felton’s extramarital trysts have long been swirling around the 
dashing Knicks player - and they have even made it into a song.

Rapper Fabolous allegedly alluded to Felton's status as an avowed ladies' man in the ‘Cuffin Season' lyrics.

‘4
 Celtics, Knicks guard, you know Felton,’ he rapped. ‘This n—- in 
Atlanta AirTran her, no Delta. Been naughty all year trying to end it 
nicely, Summer hoes turning into winter wifeys.’

Ladies' man: It has been rumored that Felton, 29, had multiple affairs since tying the knot in July 2012

In their wedding video from July 2012, Felton vowed to be true to his leading lady.

‘Beautiful
 as ever, from the first day I met her,’ the Knicks player declared. 
‘I’m going to take care of her. You have my word. I promise you. No 
matter what it is, I’m always there for you. I love you.’

Wearing
 a black sweatshirt with a peace sign and other symbols on it, Felton 
was seemingly upbeat as he appeared before Judge Diana Boyar, nodding 
affirmatively after he was ordered to stay away from his wife, Ariane 
Raymondo-Felton. He did not enter a plea, which is common for this stage
 in the case.

'Mr. Felton has no interest in having 
contact' with her, one of his lawyers, James Walden, told the judge. 
Court records show she filed for divorce from Felton last week.

Felton
 was released on $25,000 bail and was ushered into a black SUV following
 his arraignment. Under the terms of his bond, Felton can travel to 
games, bail bondsman Ira Judelson said.

Prosecutors
 said they were told Felton stored the Belgian-made FN Herstal model 
handgun in the home from August through February.

A lawyer for Felton's 
wife, a Cornell University graduate, dropped off the 
weapon at a station house on Manhattan's upper West Side Monday 
evening, shortly before tipoff of the Knicks game against the Dallas 
Mavericks at Madison Square Garden, police said.

Final straw: Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce just days after a Valentine's Day fight with her husband, during which the man allegedly waved his handgun in her face

The gun had 18 rounds of live ammunition in its magazine, which can hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said.

He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a firearm. The firearm charge is punishable by up to four years in prison. The weapons charge is punishable by up to seven years in prison.

The section under which he was charged concerns having a large-capacity ammunition magazine.

Police had arrested Felton on charges that included a mid-level weapons-possession charge that can entail having a loaded gun outside one's home or business or having a loaded gun with the intention to use it against someone.

The DA's office didn't comment on why prosecutors chose the charges they did; it's not uncommon for charges to change between arrest and arraignment.

Investigators reached Felton by 
contacting the director of security at Madison Square Garden after his 
wife made a statement to detectives Monday night, police said. Felton 
turned himself in at 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, not long after the Knicks' 
buzzer-beater loss to Dallas, police said.

The former University of North Carolina star made no statement after he arrived at the precinct with a lawyer, police said.

A
 Knicks spokesman has said the team had no immediate comment. An 
attorney for Raymondo-Felton didn't comment. The Knicks had no game 
scheduled Tuesday.

Felton had eight points and seven assists Monday in the Knicks' 110-108 loss to Dallas. The Knicks brought the point guard back for a second stint in New York in July 2012, opting to let Jeremy Lin leave, and Felton helped the Knicks win the Atlantic Division last year.

But he has had a disappointing season, averaging 10.4 points and shooting 40 percent while missing 16 games with a series of injuries. He has been frequently criticized by fans as the Knicks have fallen to 21-36.

NBA spokesman Tim Frank said the league was monitoring the case. It could fine or suspend Felton, but usually waits until after the legal case has been resolved.

The league did break from that policy
 to suspend Gilbert Arenas for the remainder of the season after he 
brought guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room during the 2009-10 
season. He was eventually sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house.

Felton
 is not the first pro athlete to run afoul of New York's strict gun 
laws. Plaxico Burress was a New York Giants wide receiver when he was 
arrested in 2008 after accidentally shooting himself in a Manhattan 
nightclub. He served two years in prison.

Fighter
 Robert Guerrero was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport last year after
 he presented a locked gun box containing an unloaded handgun during 
check-in. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was ordered to pay
 a $250 fine and complete 50 hours of community service.

In
 other high-profile cases, multiplatinum-selling rappers Lil Wayne and 
Ja Rule both were arrested in Manhattan, separately, on gun-possession 
charges in their vehicles after leaving the same concert they had both 
played in 2007.

Both pleaded guilty to attempted gun possession charges;
 Lil Wayne spent about eight months in a city jail; Ja Rule served most 
of a two-year prison sentence.

Felton
 is set to earn $3.8million next season and has a player option that 
would pay him $4million in 2015-16. The Knicks could attempt to void 
the contract, but that would likely be challenged by the players' 
association.
