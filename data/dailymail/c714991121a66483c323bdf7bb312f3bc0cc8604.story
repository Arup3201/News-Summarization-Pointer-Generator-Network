The Taliban claimed responsibility today for a double truck bomb attack on Afghanistan's US trained intelligence agency which killed 18 people and injuring 150. 

The co-ordinated attack on the complex in Ghazni, central Afghanistan was the biggest Taliban offensive in recent weeks. 

Two trucks packed with explosives were used in the attack. One of the vehicles was parked outside the rear gate of the National Directorate of Security building, while the second truck was left outside a police building containing a rapid reaction force.

More than 150 people were wounded, mainly by flying glass after the twin powerful explosions this morning which were claimed by the Taliban earlier this afternoon

Two trucks laden with explosives were detonated simultaneously during this morning's double suicide attack in Ghazni province in central Afghanistan 

Both trucks were detonated simultaneously at sunrise before a group of Taliban attempted to storm both buildings armed with rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles and light machine guns.

One of the bombs left a ten-metre hole crater in the ground. The attack also destroyed the city's library and two museums.  

Provincial governor for the Ghazni region Musa Khan Akbarzada said that 19 Taliban were involved in the atrocity.

He said: 'The bombs were so powerful that many civilians were wounded
because of falling roofs and shattering of windows in their
homes.'

The attackers fought a gun battle with members of the US trained NDS as they tried to storm the compound.  

Dozens of the wounded were taken to a lone hospital in
Ghazni where doctors were forced to treat many of them outside.

The attack in Ghazni, one of the provinces that surround the
capital city of Kabul, is the latest in a series of offensives
launched by the Taliban in the summer fighting season.

The blast shattered windows in surrounding buildings injuring scores of civilians who had to be treated for their injuries in the street as the hospital was overwhelmed

Following the blasts, more than a dozen Taliban engaged Afghan security forces in the NDS compound in a fierce gun battle killing an estimated 19 insurgents 

This latest attack is the second in less than a week following a similar bombing on Afghan government institutions in the eastern city of Jalalabad 

Insurgents have carried out complex attacks on government
installations, including in Logar and Wardak provinces which are
the gateways to the heavily guarded national capital. 

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility
for the attack and said dozens of Afghan soldiers were killed.

'It is a success for us and failure to our enemies that they
didn't even notice how our fighters in big numbers reached the
intelligence agency with explosive-laden cars and carried out
attacks.'

He added: 'Their 13-year-old occupation is now seen as a historical shame. It was planned that Afghanistan's next leader would participate in the Wales Summit. Now their plans have come to naught.'

The attack on the NDS was the second in less than a week
after a similar bombing in the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Afghan officials have in the past blamed such truck bombings
near the capital and in Kabul itself on the Haqqani network, one
of the deadliest Taliban factions.

The network based along the border with Pakistan is believed
to be behind some of the most audacious attacks in Kabul
including the bombing of the Indian embassy and the 2011 attack
on the US embassy.

A prolonged political deadlock over a disputed presidential
election has added to anxiety over the threat posed by the
Taliban once most foreign combat forces leave by the end of this
year.

The troubled political transition has led to a prolonged
delay in signing a security pact with the United States
governing how many troops will remain. 

The deadly attack destroyed the library in Ghazni as well as two museums and caused extensive damage to surrounding houses and businesses 

The compound was targeted by the Taliban as the issue of Afghanistan was due to be discussed briefly during today's Nato summit in Wales 

Afghan government officials believe that 19 Taliban gunmen were killed by defending troops during this morning's dawn raid 

The twin explosions caused extensive damage to the outer cordon of the Government compound in Ghanzi, ripping apart 40 foot long storage containers
