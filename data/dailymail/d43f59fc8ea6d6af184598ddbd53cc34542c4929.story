A woman who used to be mistaken for overweight soap character Mandy Dingle after her weight reached 23 stone has shed more than half her bodyweight - and is now a trim size 10.

Danielle Sheehan used to overindulge on junk food and sit in front of the television watching soaps every day, resulting in her piling on the pounds and becoming morbidly obese.

Her size 26 frame was so big that she wouldn't go on public transport or on fairground rides because she took up two seats.

What a difference: Danielle Sheehan, 23, from Bulwell, Notts, dropped from 23st and a size 26 to a trim 10st 12lbs and size 10, by adopting a more healthy diet

Danielle was even likened to Strictly Come Dancing star Lisa Riley, better known as Mandy Dingle from the TV soap Emmerdale, when she went out.

But now, having dropped to a svelte size 10 and after losing a staggering seven stone in just six months, she says she gets compared to sexy soap star Kym Marsh.

After three years of hard work and determination she now weighs just 10st 12lb.

Before, Danielle's diet consisted of a Full English for breakfast, big baguettes and crisps for lunch and fatty meals like lasagne and chips in the evening with at least 12 bars of chocolate a day as snacks.

Danielle, 23, from Bulwell, Notts, said: 'My calorie intake was unreal. It was more the quantity, the amount of food I was eating and I didn't exercise - I was so lazy.

Disciplined: Danielle lost the first seven stone in a remarkable six months and continued to drop the pounds through regular exercise and a diet of 1,500 calories a day

'At 23 stone, I was miserable. I wanted to look like an FHM High Street Honey, not Mandy Dingle. My confidence evaporated and I stopped going out with my mates. Instead I stayed at home in my comfort zone, gorging on cakes and chocolate, slumped in front of the soaps.

'It took over my life. I was embarrassed by my size so I would sit in and binge - it was a vicious circle. It was a lonely place to be.'

After being told by doctors she would not be able to conceive naturally if she didn't dramatically change her lifestyle, Danielle decided to use this blow as her 'thinspiration' to take action.

She became a fitness fanatic, embarking on long runs five days a week, going to the gym and doing spinning classes, and stripped back to a diet of fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish.

The coffee shop worker said: 'I decided enough was enough. I looked like a fat soap character but I was the only one who could change that. I wanted to walk into a room and be noticed but not as the 'fat one with a pretty face.' I wanted to feel sexy and be me again.

'I was like a bull in a china shop, exercising and sticking to 1,500 calories a day.'

Recalling the start of her diet in September 2009, she said: 'It was like a drug addiction but with food and chocolate - I had withdrawal symptoms. I was nasty, aggressive and snappy at first but then I would go for a run and it would make me feel amazing.

Danielle was motivated by the thought of having children and says she was tired as being seen as the 'fat girl with a pretty face' and wanted to feel sexy again

The dramatic weight loss helped Danielle to conceive naturally. She gave birth to Keenan, now two and a half, in February 2010.

That gave her even more motivation to continue with her new regime and she is now enjoying a new lease of life and her new slim frame after three years of hard work.

Danielle, who has since split with her partner, added: 'My son was my only motivation. I was not going to be the fat mum at the school gates and have him bullied because of my size.

'I feel a lot more confident now and sexy. I feel amazing. I have lost the old me and gained this amazing confidence.

'Now people compare me to Kym Marsh instead of Mandy Dingle, which is a huge compliment.
