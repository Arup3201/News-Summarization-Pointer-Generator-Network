An Australian couple who became trapped in Thailand with their newborn twins following changes to the country's commercial surrogacy laws have finally arrived back home in Australia.

Kate and Adam Osborne, from Kempsey on NSW's mid-north coast, landed at Port Macquarie airport with their twin daughters on Tuesday morning to a crowd of waiting friends and family.

Sierra-Leone and Mali Osborne were born on July 22 in Bangkok to a Thai surrogate mother.

But due to changes to Thai surrogacy laws when the twins were born, the couple were unable to bring the girls home until they had a court order granting consent from the birth mother.

Mr and Mrs Osborne, 40 and 35, spent a month in a hotel room with their newborn daughters while they were locked in a legal battle with the Thai government.

'It's such a relief to finally be home,' Mr Osborne told the Daily Telegraph.

The couple had spent more than $100,000 and six years trying to start a family and turned to Thai surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed IVF attempts in Australia.

Mali and Sierra-Leone were born just weeks before the horrific story of baby Gammy emerged and shocked the world. 

Gammy, also a twin, was born to a Thai surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, but was allegedly abandoned by his West Australian parents because he had Down syndrome.

Gammy's biological father David Farnell later revealed in a 60 Minutes interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child's Down syndrome sooner, saying: 'No parent wants a son with a disability'.

Mr Osborne had earlier explained that they could not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation.

'Our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork (Australian citizenship, Australian passports),' he said.

'Before the Thai army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday (22/7/2014)  you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family.

'Now its a different story, now its considered "Human trafficking" because they see it as though we are stealing someones children, and if they ask to see babies' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate's name is on certificate as their mother.

'We had D.N.A tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way, shape or form are related to birth mother (our surrogate). So we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country.'

At the end of July the laws radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave Thailand with their children without a court order

Friends of Mr and Mrs Osborne had set up a fundraising page to raise money to pay for new flights home and their unexpectedly long stay in Thailand.

When the couple and their daughters arrived home on Tuesday, more than $8,000 had been raised.

The couple have reportedly signed a deal with Channel 7 to tell their story on the Sunday Night program, the Telegraph reports.

Mr Osborne explained that they could not simply bring their children home to Australia, despite having all the required Australian documentation

A statement from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, regarding Australian parents being prevented from bringing their children home from Thailand, said: 'We have been advised that Thai authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country, when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in Thailand.

'The Australian Government's Smartraveller website was updated on 14 August to reflect these requirements.

'We strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so. In particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements.

'While regulation of surrogacy in Thailand is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected.'
