Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been handed a surprise call-up for Euro 2012 as Rio Ferdinand was made the big-name casualty in Roy Hodgson's 23-man England squad.

Steven Gerrard has also been confirmed as captain for the tournament.

Former England captain Ferdinand has been axed from the line-up - but there is room for John Terry despite his upcoming court case over his race row with Rio's brother Anton.

Hodgson, who was only appointed last month to replace Fabio Capello, revealed his full squad as they head into battle in Poland and Ukraine.

As well as including Arsenal winger Oxlade-Chamberlain, he also opted to call up another rookie - Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy, who will battle Robert Green to be Joe Hart's understudy.

Ruddy will go ahead with his wedding on June 2, which was booked last year when he wasn't even considered for international duty.

Stewart Downing, Theo Walcott and Ashley Young were handed wide berths in addition to Oxlade-Chamberlain.

The 18-year-old has started just six Barclays Premier League games for Arsenal and interim manager Stuart Pearce opted against bringing the winger into his squad for the February friendly with Holland.

However, he has taken advantage of Adam Johnson's failure to cement a place in Manchester City's drive for the title.

It means, barring injury, Johnson misses out for a second time, having also been axed from Fabio Capello's provisional World Cup squad two years ago.

Key names to miss out are Peter Crouch, Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge, who is named as a stand-by.

Is Hodgson right to axe Rio Ferdinand for Euro 2012?

Manchester United's Paul Scholes is also absent despite Hodgson being tempted to hand the veteran a shock recall.

Also on stand-by is Jack Butland, Phil Jagielka, Jordan Henderson and Adam Johnson.

England are pitted against France, Sweden and Ukraine next month as they attempt to reach the final in Kiev on July 1.

They meet in Manchester on Wednesday before training at City's Etihad Stadium ahead of their flight to Oslo to play Norway on the Saturday.

Seven days after that, England face Belgium at Wembley - although Ruddy will be missing, having been given special dispensation to leave for his wedding.

The snub for Ferdinand is likely to signal the end of his international career.

On Ferdinand's omission, Hodgson - who was under no pressure from the FA regarding Terry's inclusion - said: 'He is a man I respect. I had to make a football decision on the basis of what I have seen in recent months. It was a hard phone call to make. It was based purely on football and nothing else.'

Disappointment: Ferdinand, who lined-up for United in Tuesday night's testimonial for Harry Gregg in Belfast, will not be going to Euro 2012

Talks were held between Terry and Hodgson at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground on Tuesday - and the England boss has resolved the issue of having Ferdinand and Terry in the same dressing room when Terry is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse Anton.

The FA stripped Terry of the captaincy, which led to Fabio Capello quitting as England manager in February.

On Friday, Sir Alex Ferguson did suggest the 33-year-old was not capable of playing two matches in four days, which might have played a part in Hodgson's eventual decision.

Ferdinand has been a regular for United this season though and was fit enough to play 45 minutes in Tuesda night's testimonial match for Harry Gregg in Belfast.

In: Andy Carroll

Out: Micah Richards

The defender had made himself available despite the obvious potential for conflict with Terry.Ferdinand is known to be unimpressed with today's news though, which is likely to mark the end of his 81-cap England career and mean he will never have appeared at a European Championships.

He was not selected in 2000, missed out through suspension four years later and was part of an England squad that failed to qualify for Euro 2008 under Steve McClaren.

Hodgson also presented his new employers with a logistical headache when he cancelled next week’s training trip to Malaga in Spain.

He had already decided to give the Chelsea players involved in Saturday’s Champions League final the week off, as well as Wayne Rooney, and has now decided it is not worth going.
