Charged: Suicidal former business executive Robert Dellinger, pictured, slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway Saturday, killing a pregnant woman and her fiance, a father-of-three

A former Fortune 500 executive has been released on bail days after authorities say he killed a young pregnant woman and her fiance in a New Hampshire crash while trying to take his own life.

Corrections officials said Thursday 53-year-old Robert Dellinger, of Sunapee, was set free after his family posted $250,000 bail.

Dellinger is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the horrific crash, which left 29-year-old Jason Timmons, a father of three, 24-year-old Amanda Murphy and their unborn baby dead.

Prosecutors said Dellinger's truck crossed the median on Interstate 89, became airborne and sheared off the top of the couple's car, killing the pair instantly.

The medical examiner's report said the injuries they suffered were consistent with a plane crash.

Dellinger kept his face covered with his jacket and held onto an officer as he was led out of a corrections vehicle and into his summer home in Lakeside shortly before 6pm last night.

Under the conditions of his release, the former executive must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, is prohibited from driving or leaving the state, and he must undergo a psychiatric evaluation, the station WMUR reported.

He is due back in court December 19 for a probable cause hearing.

Captain of industry: The 53-year-old Wesleyan University graduate served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc until 2011

The 53-year-old Wesleyan University graduate served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc.

He took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks when he abruptly left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Dellinger, who also held top-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., bought a home on Sunapee Lake in November 2012, according to property records.

Susan Morrell, senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire, said during Dellinger's arraignment that he argued with his wife, Deborah, over his medications on the morning of the crash.

He left the house and began to drive 
around, growing increasingly despondent, she said. A trooper said 
Dellinger told him he intended to kill himself.

'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.'

Morrell noted the portion of median Dellinger chose had no trees, rocks or other obstacles.

'He could have chosen many other ways to kill himself that would not put anyone else in danger,' she said.

Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 'productive and exemplary life.' He argued for low bail for Dellinger. A judge ordered Dellinger held on $250,000 cash bail.

Timmons and Murphy got engaged in March this year, according to Timmons' Facebook account.

They lived in Wilder, Vermont, and met while working at valley Terrace Assisted Living Facility.

Timmons. He enjoyed the outdoors, especially fishing with his fiance, 
the Valley News reported.

Jasons brother Ray is unable to respond but my kids and I will send him your thoughts if anyone would like to write to him please feel free I will give you his address.... RIP !!! Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy .... We all love you so much !!'

Amanda Murphy was very excited to be a
mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their 
daughter Reagan Elizabeth.

Catherine
