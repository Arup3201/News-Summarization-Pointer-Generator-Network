Mini has unveiled its most radical vehicle yet - a one-of-a-kind pickup truck designed to tackle tough terrain.

The Paceman Adventure is a four-wheel drive Mini concept which has had its rear seats replaced with a cargo area.

It has been designed for transporting goods across gravel roads, through muddy tracks and on desert trails.

Mini has unveiled its most radical vehicle yet - a one-of-a-kind pickup truck. The Paceman Adventure is a four-wheel drive Mini concept which has had its rear seats replaced with a cargo area.

The engineers behind the creation also fitted the Paceman Adventure with a snorkel-style air filter that allows the pickup truck to drive through rivers and streams.

The pickup has a modified chassis with extended ground clearance and much higher front and rear clearance ramps.

It has additional lights mounted on the front cross member of the roof rack, to boost visibility at night, while special off-road tyres with wide and deep treads are designed to improve traction.

The Paceman Adventure was designed by Mini design apprentices in Munich and unveiled by the firm this week.

It is not the first Mini pickup - the iconic car was similarly converted into a commercial vehicle between 1961 and 1982.

However, the Paceman Adventure dwarves its inspiration in size and performance.

The original Mini pickup had a tiny 850cc engine which developed just 37 brake horse power (bhp).

It took almost 34 seconds to reach 60 miles (95km) per hour and was capable of just 69 miles (111 km) per hour.

The Paceman Adventure, by comparison, has a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine developing 184bhp.

This
 gives the concept car a 0 to 62 miles (100km) per hour time of less 
than 8 seconds and a top speed in excess of 130 miles (210km) per hour.

Mini
 originally built more than 50,000 pickups, but the BMW-owned company 
said there were no current plans for the Paceman Adventure to see 
full-scale production.

The Paceman Adventure is not the first Mini pickup to be made - back in 1961 the iconic Mini was converted into a commercial pickup vehicle until it was discontinued in 1982

Unfortunately there are no plans for a production version of the vehicle just yet, so fans will need to make do with seeing it in action in these images

Thanks to smart engineering it can also drive through rivers and streams
