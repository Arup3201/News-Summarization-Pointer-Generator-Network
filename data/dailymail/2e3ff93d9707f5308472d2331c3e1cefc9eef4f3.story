'Hurt': Alan Titchmarsh has revealed he stepped down after 30 years of hosting BBC's coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show because he was not given the role of lead presenter

After 30 years hosting BBC coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show, Alan Titchmarsh’s departure left his  fans bemused.

Now he has revealed he stepped down because his role as lead presenter was given to fellow gardener and Daily Mail columnist Monty Don.

Mr Titchmarsh said he was ‘hurt’ by the Corporation’s decision to do so and when asked to play second-fiddle to Mr Don, he said he was made ‘an offer I had to refuse’.

It is believed to be the first time 
the former Gardeners’ World presenter, 65, has spoken in detail about 
his announcement in November last year to quit the Chelsea Flower Show.

In an interview with the Radio Times, he said he was not bitter and he had moved on.

But he admitted: ‘Yes, I suppose I was hurt, because I know people enjoy you doing it as much as I loved doing it.

‘But
 they probably felt it was time for a change and may well be right. Was I
 dumped for Monty Don? You might say that. I couldn’t possibly comment. I
 don’t feel dumped.

They made me an offer I had to refuse. It’s up to them. I’m not bitter.

‘I
 was disappointed but I’m not a grudge-bearer. You have to move on. 
Nobody owes you a living. I’m still gainfully employed. My days aren’t 
empty.’

Mr Titchmarsh was 
the unofficial face of Chelsea Flower Show for 30 years gaining as much 
attraction from television viewers as the prize-winning gardens.

The
 chat show host denied that his replacement’s lack of horticultural 
training - Don is a self-professed ‘amateur gardener’ - bothered him.

‘Presenting
 is a skill in itself. I’ve presented programmes on classical music, 
nature and the royal family, all lifelong interests. I don’t hold Monty 
Don’s lack of training against him,’ he said.

Titchmarsh,
 who was succeeded by Don on Gardeners’ World when he left in 2002, 
added: ‘He’s passionate and he gets through to a lot of people. We have 
different audiences. Good luck to him. I’m not going to slag him off.’

Asked whether he agreed with garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, who described Don as a ‘brilliant gardener’, he said: ‘I don’t know enough about him to say. I know I recommended him to take over Gardeners’ World from me because he was a good anchorman.’

Titchmarsh added: ‘Jealousy eats you away. There’s no point. Leave it behind. We’ve all got problems, had tragedies in our lives. I don’t see any point in whingeing.’

‘A trouble shared is a trouble dragged out till bedtime. The people who have life sussed are outward-looking, doing stuff for other folk.

‘There’s so much self-analysis now. I realise it seems rich coming from someone whose work is in the media, the cult of personality if you like, but fame is a by-product, not a goal. What drives me is contentment, satisfaction and stimulation, and the avoidance of jealousy and bitterness. Those things don’t achieve anything.’

Despite this, Mr Titchmarsh claims never to have watched Gardeners’ World – which he fronted for six years – since Mr Don took over.

He said: ‘I’d either be grumpy because I didn’t like what they were doing, or uppity because they were doing it too well. It wouldn’t be healthy for me to watch so I moved on.’

This year marks Titchmarsh’s fiftieth as a professional gardener and will also see him publish a book on the Queen’s palaces and present television shows Britain’s Best Gardens and Love Your Garden, as well as his weekly slot on Classic FM.

The dad-of-two, who made his name bringing gardening to the masses on BBC One’s Ground Force, has become a personality trusted by millions for his DIY and gardening know-how.

And Mr Titchmarsh will still be associated with the Chelsea Flower Show, which opens later this month, he will be showcasing a garden  – his first at the event since 1985 – commissioned by the Royal Horticultural Society to mark the fiftieth anniversary of their Britain in Bloom campaign.

Known for his sunny disposition, Mr Titchmarsh said he won’t use his high profile to dig at his former employers, even agreeing to be interviewed for the coverage he used to front.

In the wide-ranging interview for the Radio Times, Mr Titchmarsh expanded on controversial comments he made last year about how older women on TV should stop ‘whinging’ about ageism.

He warned women to be certain they are being discriminated against because of age, and not incompetence, before making such allegations.

He said: ‘I don’t think I’d be confident enough to say, ‘They’ve stopped me doing this because I’m too old,’ because my inner voice would be saying, ‘No, they’ve stopped you doing it, love, because you’re not terribly good anymore.’’

Filling the secondary role that Mr Titchmarsh turned down is newsreader Sophie Raworth.

The BBC News at One presenter, while insisting she comes from a ‘family of gardeners’, admits she is ‘not a professional’.
