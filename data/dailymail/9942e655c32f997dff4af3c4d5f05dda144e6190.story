Tragic: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, fell 60ft from a south-west London block of flats, the inquest heard

A 13-year-old schoolgirl discovered that a rumour of her being filmed performing a sex act on a boy had been circulating just hours before she plunged 60ft to her death, an inquest heard.

Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, who died in March 2011 in Battersea, south-west London, had changed her BlackBerry Messenger profile picture to someone with their head in a bin, saying: ‘F**k this Life’, the court was told.

The troubled teenager spoke about wanting to die and had discovered the rumour circulating Saint Cecilia's School in Wandsworth, south-west London, Westminster Coroners’ Court heard.

Chevonea had gone around school at the end of the day saying sorry for anything bad she had done and one friend said she ‘seemed suicidal’ for someone normally ‘bubbly and smiley’.

‘We talked through BBM, I was the person who told her about the video and I regretfully did it through BBM,’ the friend said. ‘I found out about the video on Tuesday from another friend.’

Another friend said: ‘She had put up a picture on her BBM profile sometime around 5pm of someone throwing their head in a bin saying ‘F**k this Life’. I asked what it was about. She said: "Nothing, don’t worry”. I told her not to throw her life away because of some p***k.’

Another friend told the inquest that 
the boy, whom Chevonea had allegedly performed a sex act on at a party, phoned to 
say she fallen from her window and died - before she had plummeted.

Claims: Her mother Angela Kendall earlier told the inquest how her daughter had been 'bubbly' but bullying had led to her self-harming

The witness said: ‘He said she had 
jumped out the window. I called her and she answered and she started 
crying and talking about life and stuff.

‘She said she couldn’t take life no 
more and didn’t want to be here anymore. We both said bye and that was 
the last time I heard from her.’

The witness also claimed Chevonea had changed her BBM status to ‘he wants me dead, he wants me to jump’ two days earlier.

Chevonea had been the victim of 
bullying, which had got worse after two boys forced her into sex acts, 
one of whom had threatened to break her windows.

But despite being verbally and 
physically abused by more than 11 boys in school, one of her teachers 
said it was just ‘kids being kids’, the court was told.

A friend said: ‘There was loads of 
bullying going on, coming from the boys at school. It started off 
verbal, then physical, then cyber bullying.

‘It never stopped for a few months or a few weeks - it was at least every day there was some kind of bullying happening.

‘The teachers weren’t stopping it, 
they didn’t know anything about it, and several times we had gone to 
them - Chevonea on her own and with friends - and they tried to stop it 
but it was never a priority of theirs.

‘I remember having conversations with them and they said formally they can’t do anything, they can’t exclude the boys.

‘A teacher said they hadn’t done anything wrong and kids will be kids, and kids will be cruel.’

Chevonea, who had cut herself in class
before, was said to have once tried to take an overdose in a maths 
lesson and had to have the pills forced out of her hand, the court was
told.

The inquest continues.
