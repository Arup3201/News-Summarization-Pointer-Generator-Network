This extraordinary footage captures the intense moment police smash down two front doors in raids - using a battering ram fitted with a camera. 

The video shows officers forcing their way into two homes in Coventry, West Midlands, as part of a crack down on foreign criminals operating in the UK. 

The clip was released today by West Midlands Police - who used a state-of-the-art Go-Pro HD camera to record the action.

Savvy: West Midlands Police used a state-of-the-art Go-Pro HD camera to record two house raids in Coventry

They are the first force in the UK to film a police raid from the point of view of their heavy-duty Enforcer battering rams - which are 1.9ft long and weigh 16kg.

The first address in the Stoke area of the city was raided by officers at around 9am on Wednesday.

A 42-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods after a large quantity of jewellery was discovered.

At 10am police raided a second house nearby which was believed of being an illegal sex den.

A 26-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of managing a brothel.

All three people have been bailed pending further enquiries as part of Operation Trivium.

Inspector Wes Martin, from Coventry Police, said: 'This video gives members of the public a unique view of how we carry out raids to target suspects involved in crime.

'Operation Trivium has been taking place across the country this week and has seen officers from countries including Romania, Poland and Lithuania assisting officers in the UK.

'A key part of the raids yesterday was having a colleague from Romanian police with us who was able to communicate with people we encountered and assisted with intelligence checks during the day.

'Raids like this often come on the back of information received by members of the public and I would ask anyone with any knowledge of suspicious activity in their neighbourhood to contact us on 101.'

The operation saw more than 700 crime suspects arrested across the country after police officers from 14 European forces joined a clampdown on foreign crooks.

Senior officers from Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Hungary and Finland met at the Trivium control centre in Edgbaston, Birmingham to witness the operation in action. 

West Midlands Police Superintendent Paul Keasey, who is leading Operation Trivium, added: 'These examples illustrate how we're working with European police colleagues, Europol and the National Crime Agency to catch and deal swiftly with foreign crime suspects.

'In the first 48 hours of Operation Trivium we have arrested more than 700 foreign nationals suspected of committing crime in the UK. That's a great result.

Crackdown: Officers rush into the house as part of Operation Trivium - a nationwide clampdown on foreign criminals

'There's huge momentum behind this initiative and enthusiasm from police forces on the continent to contribute to more pan-European police operations going forward.'

All 43 police forces across the UK are taking part in Operation Trivium and running checks on people and vehicles through the control centre in Birmingham.

Dutch Police Hoofdinspecteur Richard Uppelschoten said his police force was looking to replicate the operation with Belgian colleagues next month.

He said: 'What I have seen is fantastic. Police from lots of different countries pulling together to stop mobile criminals who cross borders.

'We want to do the same in Holland, plans are well underway, and I can only see operations like this becoming part of normal police business in the future.'
