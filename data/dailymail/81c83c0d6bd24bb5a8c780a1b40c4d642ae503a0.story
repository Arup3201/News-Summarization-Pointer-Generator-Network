This is the controversial banner which could be removed by council in the local area of Evans Head

It is a sight often seen on the beaches of Evans Head but signs with a bikini-clad teenager walking across with her surfboard has caused a wave of controversy.

The image appeared on promotional banners in a main street in Evans Head - a coastal town in northern New South Wales.

But Richmond Valley Council - which takes in Evans Head - has taken down the signs after receiving a complaint from a constituent who said it was inappropriate.

The move by the council has caused such a stir that there is now a petition to re-instate the banners.

So far, it has garnered 160 signatures, with the target set at 400 - which petition organiser Petria Powell said would be a good representation of the views of the 3,000-strong town.

The girl at the centre of the drama is teenage athlete Kirrah Cooke, 17, who is a local identity.

Kirrah represents the region in longboarding, soccer and cross country, and said she was shocked by the reaction.

'I feel that it’s kind of ridiculous because we live in a real beachy community and you see it everywhere,' she said.

'Just because a minority were against it, it was taken down - I just don’t understand why that would happen.

'We live in a democratic society, so you think a majority would rule.

'Whoever complained, they must be unaware of the beach culture that we live in here.'

Kirrah said the move to remove the signs was sexist.

'People see things so differently if a guy was topless. In my mind, if it was a guy no one would have complained,' she said.

'If anything, it's was promoting female surfing and a healthy lifestyle.'

The removal of the signs has caused such a stir that Evans Head business owner Petria Powell has started up a petition to reinstate them.

The Muzza's Milk Bar owner said she was angered by the move.

'There’s nothing wrong with the picture,' Ms Powell said.

'I saw council removing it on Friday because of one resident in the town who said it sexist and wasn’t appropriate for the town.

'But it’s the complete opposite because Evans Head is for young people and surfing.'

MailOnline has contacted Richmond Valley Council for comment on the matter.
