A soldier who made a miracle recovery after being shot in the head by the Taliban has married the sweetheart who helped nurse him back to health.

Ashley Irving and Amy Thurlow tied the knot on Saturday morning in the knowledge their romance was very nearly shattered by the war in Afghanistan.

Three years ago 24-year-old Army corporal Ashley was shot in the head by an insurgent during a fire-fight.

Marital bliss: Ashley Irving and bride Aimee married at St Cuthberts Church, Plumbland after she helped nurse him back to health following being shot in the head by the Taliban

But with expert medical care and the support of Amy, 23, whom he met in Cockermouth, Cumbria, five years ago, he made a full recovery.

Amy, a support worker in Workington, recalled passing out with shock when she was told that Ashley, from Aspatria, Cumbria, had been shot.

She said: 'At first I'd thought he was dead.

'I was at work when I got that call. After I'd woken up he called me and told me what had happened. It was a massive relief to hear him.

'He's the love of my life."

Family support: Amy and Ashley's parents and sister stayed at his bedside for nine days as he began recovering from his injury

Short-lived: Sadly their celebrations will be short-lived because the groom went straight back to work the following day, training new soldiers at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire

Amy and Ashley's parents and sister stayed at his bedside in Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham for nine days as he began recovering from his injury - a fractured skull which meant he lost five per cent peripheral vision in his right eye.

He returned to his duties with the Duke of Lancaster's 2nd battalion after seven months.

Amy said: 'As far as he's concerned he is just doing his job - but it's a job he loves and there's nothing else he'd rather do.

'He was shot during his first tour of duty in Afghanistan, but he's now done four.

'Marrying him means everything to me. In a sense, he's like two people. He's one person at work, and then there's the man I see, somebody who's loving and kind.'

Ashley said: 'I was in the Army when I met Amy, so she's used to me being away.

'When I think back to when I was shot, I can't believe that I'm still alive, but all I wanted to do was get back to Amy.'

Amy's mother Shirley, 51, also recalled the moment when Ashley, unable to contact his family, rang her to say he was injured.

She said: 'It was horrendous, he's such a likeable, easy-going lad.

'Amy's dad Steven died a year ago next Saturday from cancer and Ashley was brilliant when it happened.'

The couple married at St Cuthbert's Church in Plumbland, where Amy is originally from, and held their reception at The Castle Inn Hotel, Bassenthwaite.

Ashley was due to return to barracks in Catterick this week and the couple hope to have a proper honeymoon in six months.
