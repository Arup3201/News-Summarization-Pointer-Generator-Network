Traces of extraterrestrial life are most likely to be first detected on planets orbiting dying stars, according to new research.

A theoretical study of Earth-like planets orbiting white dwarf stars found we could detect oxygen in the atmosphere of one much more easily than on those orbiting a star like our own Sun.

Large quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely presence of life there.

This is based on the fact that if all life on Earth was to die out, our atmosphere would become devoid of oxygen, as it relies on plant life to replenish the supply through photosynthesis.

'In the quest for extraterrestrial 
biological signatures, the first stars we study should be white dwarfs,'
said Avi Loeb, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
(CfA).

When a star like the Sun dies, it sloughs off its outer layers, leaving behind a hot core called a white dwarf.

Typically about the size of Earth, a white dwarf slowly cools and fades over time, but it can retain heat long enough to warm a nearby world for billions of years.

Since a white dwarf is much smaller and fainter than the Sun, a planet would have to be much closer in to be habitable with liquid water on its surface.

Such a planet would circle the white dwarf once every 10 hours at a distance of about a million miles.

Before a star becomes a white dwarf it swells into a red giant, engulfing and destroying any nearby planets. So a planet would have to arrive in the habitable zone after the star evolved into a white dwarf.

It could form from leftover dust and gas (making it a second-generation world), or migrate inward from a larger distance, researchers say.

Previous research has suggested that the abundance of heavy elements on the surface of white dwarfs indicates that a significant fraction of them have rocky planets.

Professor Loeb and his colleague Dan Maoz, professor of physics and astronomy at Tel Aviv University, estimate that a survey of the 500 closest white dwarfs could spot one or more habitable planets.

The best method for finding such 
planets is, they say, a transit search - looking for a star that dims as
an orbiting planet crosses in front of it.

Since
a white dwarf is about the same size as Earth, an Earth-sized planet 
would block a large fraction of its light and create an obvious signal.

More importantly, we can only study the atmospheres of transiting planets.

The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST) is a large, infrared-optimised space telescope due to be launched in 2018.

With a large 21.3ft diameter mirror and a sunshield the size of a tennis court, the new space telescope is set to succeed Hubble as the foremost deep space observatory.

It will float in an orbit one million miles from Earth.

Nasa said: 'Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide.

'It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.'

Several innovative technologies have been developed for Webb. These include a folding, segmented primary mirror, adjusted to shape after launch; ultra-lightweight beryllium optics; detectors able to record extremely weak signals, microshutters that enable programmable object selection for the spectrograph; and a cryocooler for cooling the mid-IR detectors to 7K.

There will be four science instruments on Webb: the Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor/ Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS-NIRISS).

Webb's instruments will be designed to work primarily in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with some capability in the visible range. It will be sensitive to light from 0.6 to 28 micrometers in wavelength.

The new space telescope is an international collaboration between Nasa, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), with the project managed from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre.Â 

When the white dwarf's light shines 
through the ring of air that surrounds the planet's silhouetted disk, 
the atmosphere absorbs some starlight.

This leaves chemical fingerprints showing whether that air contains water vapour, or even signatures of life, such as oxygen.

Astronomers are particularly 
interested in finding oxygen because the oxygen in the Earth's 
atmosphere is continuously replenished, through photosynthesis, by plant
life.

Were all life to cease on Earth, our 
atmosphere would quickly become devoid of oxygen, which would dissolve 
in the oceans and oxidise the surface.

Thus, the presence of large quantities
of oxygen in the atmosphere of a distant planet would signal the likely
presence of life there.

It is hoped that Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch by the end of this decade, will have the ability to sniff out the gases of these alien worlds.

Professors Loeb and Maoz created a synthetic spectrum, replicating what space telescope would see if it examined a habitable planet orbiting a white dwarf.

They found that both oxygen and water vapour would be detectable with only a few hours of total observation time.

'JWST offers the best hope of finding an inhabited planet in the near future,' said Professor Maoz.

Recent research by CfA astronomers Courtney Dressing and David Charbonneau showed that the closest habitable planet is likely to orbit a red dwarf star (a cool, low-mass star undergoing nuclear fusion).

Since a red dwarf, although smaller and fainter than the Sun, is much larger and brighter than a white dwarf, its glare would overwhelm the faint signal from an orbiting planet's atmosphere.

Even an instrument as sophisticated as the James Webb Space Telescope would have to observe hundreds of hours of transits to have any hope of analyzing the atmosphere's composition.

'Although the closest habitable planet might orbit a red dwarf star, the closest one we can easily prove to be life-bearing might orbit a white dwarf,' said Professor Loeb.
