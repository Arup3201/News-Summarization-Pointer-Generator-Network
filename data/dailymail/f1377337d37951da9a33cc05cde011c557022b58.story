Pianist Yiruma sells out concerts around the world with his collection of beautiful piano ballads. 

Yet he may have some competition on his hands after a new three-piece band decided to cover his classic River Flows In You.

But these band members have more fur and whiskers than you'd expect - because they are in fact three kittens.

Russian Music Box TV put these three cute cats in a recording studio in Moscow and in a Band Aid style video recorded them singing along to the famous piano composition by the South Korean artist.

Of course the kitties, dubbed The Fab Fur after the Beatles, have become an instant hit.

Their cover has been viewed more than 300,000 times since it was uploaded on Friday. 

Yiruma is the stage name of Lee Ru-Ma who was born in 1975. He is a world-renowned pianist and composer from South Korea.

Yiruma also means 'accomplishment' in Korean.

The musician was educated in England and his most popular album, First Love, was released in 2001.

Yiruma began playing the piano at the age of five and moved to London when he was 11 to study at The Purcell School of Music, in Bushey, near Watford, Hertfordshire.
