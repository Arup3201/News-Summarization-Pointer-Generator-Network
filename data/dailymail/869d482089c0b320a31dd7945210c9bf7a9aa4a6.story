Treatment: Gibson checked into the exclusive Miraval Spa in Arizona

Hollywood star Mel Gibson has turned horse whisperer in a bid to beat his demons.

The 56-year-old Braveheart and Mad Max actor checked into the exclusive Miraval Spa in Tucson, Arizona, last week to attend a self-help 'behaviour modification programme'.

Gibson, who divorced wife Robyn last December with the largest ever Hollywood payout of £250 million after 31 years of marriage, is on probation after last year pleading no contest to a charge of violence in 2010 against his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva.

He was said by fellow guests on the course to be 'relaxed and happy' and spoke openly about wanting to improve his life.

A source said: 'You always hear about ''Mad Mel'' but he couldn't have been nicer.

'He took part in many of the self-development courses, including meditation and equine therapy.

'He said he particularly enjoyed working with the horses.'

According to the spa's website, the equine course involves using the horse 'as an energetic mirror' that might help people 'identify patterns of learned behaviour that either enhance or detract from the quality of life that you experience'.

Part of the equine therapy involves learning how to communicate with the horse 'through gentle murmurs rather than screaming orders'.

A fellow spa guest said: 'Mel has  been getting in touch with his inner child and learning to confront his demons.'

Gibson's spokesman declined to comment.
