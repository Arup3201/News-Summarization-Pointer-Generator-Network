Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo attack, who has been buried in an unmarked grave in a suburb north west of Paris

The second Islamic terrorist behind the Charlie Hebdo attack has been buried in an unmarked grave as fresh questions emerged over why French authorities stopped monitoring him.

Cherif Kouachi was interred just before midnight in a cemetery in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north west Paris, a day after his older brother Said was discreetly buried in the northeastern city of Reims.

The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine, which killed 12 people.

Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists. 

The mayor of Gennevilliers, where the younger Kouachi brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead, but said he had no legal means to block it.

His burial comes after new details emerged over why authorities stopped monitoring him and his brother despite finding texts on his laptop, which had been seized in 2010 and the fact that one of them had travelled to Yemen in 2011.

In one passage found on the laptop, entitled 'Operation Sacrifice', he eerily wrote about how he would carry out a terrorist attack.

According to the New York Times he wrote: 'A mujahideen forces his way into the enemy's base or else a zone where there is a group and fires at point-blank range without having prepared an escape plan.

'The goal is to kill as many of the enemy as possible. The author will very likely die himself.'

The paper also reported that both brothers had been watched by the intelligence services for three years but surveillance was dropped as they appeared 'non-threatening'.

It was also been revealed that police tapped the phone of Djamel Begha, a jihadist prisoner who befriended both Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who took hostages at a kosher supermarket.

The taps revealed that they were planning to break Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem, who was convicted of bombing a Paris railway station in 1995, free from prison.

Transcripts revealed the men frequently talking about 'books', code for weapons, and needing to find a 'new library', code for arms dealer.

Cherif's burial comes after his brother Said was buried in his hometown of Reims yesterday.

Its Mayor, Arnaud Robinet, said he'd 'categorically refuse' a request by Kouachi's family to bury him in the city where he lived until his death.

The burial of Cherif Kouachi comes a day after his brother Said, left, was buried in Reims. There are no plans as yet for the burial of fellow Paris attacker Amedy Coulibaly 

He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate.

'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.'

But speaking on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence.

There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in Paris - before he was killed by police on January 9.

Meanwhile anger erupted in a string of majority Muslim countries after Charlie Hebdo responded to the massacre by running another cartoon showing the Prophet Mohammed under the headline 'All is forgiven'.

The worst unrest has been in Niger, where at least five people were killed and some eight churches were torched yesterday.

Around 1,000 youths wielding iron bars, clubs and axes rampaged through the capital, hurling rocks at police who responded with tear gas.

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned 'the use of violence' in Niger while President Francois Hollande said France was committed to 'freedom of expression', calling it 'non-negotiable'.

In a speech, Hollande urged his compatriots not to change their habits, because 'to do so would be to yield to terrorism'.
