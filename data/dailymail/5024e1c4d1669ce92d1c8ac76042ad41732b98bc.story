Children have been banned from a town centre at night under sweeping new police plans to crack down on anti-social behaviour.

Police officers have been given the power to stop anyone under 16 from walking the streets in Barsley, South Yorkshire, after 9pm, and to take them home if they are not with a parent or responsible adult.

The six-month dispersal order - which police said was introduced in the wake of reports of rowdy and abusive behaviour in the town centre - has been branded 'totally wrong' and a 'blatant infringement' of civil liberties by critics.

No children allowed: Police in Barnsley can now stop children under 16 from walking around the town centre after 9pm

The order, which came into force yesterday and covers the hours between 9pm and 6am, also gives police the power to disperse groups of two or more people from areas where there is persistent anti-social behaviour.

Any breach of a dispersal order, such as refusing to comply with being told to leave, is classed as a criminal offence.

'Abusive behaviour': Police said Barnsley residents have complained of feeling 'harassed and intimidated'

Campaigners have warned that the ban infringes on civil liberties and said it amounted to treating groups of young people as criminals.

Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said a dispersal order was a 'blunt, crude tool' that, at best, moves the problem to another location nearby.'It is a sign that the police have lost control of the streets and yet does nothing to restore either the community spirit or respect for the law that has been lost,' he said.

'It's simple - if people break the law, harass people and cause distress then the police should arrest them.

'The idea that simply by being under 16 and in town is grounds for the police to take you home seems a waste of time and resources.

'To treat every group of young people as criminals is totally wrong and a blatant infringement on people's rights to move around Barnsley.'The campaign group Liberty has said dispersal orders 'blur the distinction between nuisance and criminal behaviour'.

Inspector Julie Mitchell, from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'Over the past few months, we have received numerous reports of nuisance caused by large groups congregating in the town centre.

'The Barnsley Interchange has reported a number of nuisance behaviour incidents within their premises, and the County Way car park has been a regular venue for nuisance drivers late at night.

'Many interventions have been put in place and although some measures have had some success, nuisance behaviour still persists on an almost daily basis.

'The common theme that appears to cause the most concern is rowdy, inconsiderate and abusive behaviour,' Insp Mitchell added.

'This is often from people in large groups and has led to members of the public and business community reporting the feeling of being harassed and intimidated.'

The officer said discretion would be used and that the force wants to encourage residents and visitors to go into the town centre for retail and leisure.

'By dispersing those groups intent on engaging in poor behaviour, we will ensure Barnsley is a safer and stronger town for everyone else,' she said.
