A foul mouthed Italian politician has sparked a diplomatic row after he posted an insult on his Twitter account following England's World Cup defeat.

Senate Vice President Maurizio Gasparri, labelled English people 'pretentious d***s' just minutes after the final whistle in the early hours of yesterday morning after the 2-1 setback.

Diplomatic sources at the British Embassy in Rome said they were aware of the reports with on describing them as "highly insulting" adding that officials in London would be notified.

Gasparri, a member of disgraced former PM Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, wrote: 'It's always a pleasure to say 'go...themselves" to the English...pretentious and d***s.'

Minutes later he posted another offending Tweet writing: 'Great game, great victory it's great that it gets the English right in that place always arrogant and unbelievable.'

His offensive postings were also heavily criticised by Italians on Twitter with many saying it was 'hardly the language of a politician' with others calling on him to apologise.

Instead Gasparri, who used to Minister
 of Communication in Berlusconi's government, later wrote on his 
account: 'Detestable English, is that OK ?'

In
 the past Gasparri has also been in trouble for rows on Twitter 
involving immigration and political opponents and he is often ridiculed 
on Italian comedy shows.

Six
 years ago he caused outrage when he told Italian TV that with 'Barack 
Obama in the White House Al Qaeda is happier' with the Democratic Party 
heavily critical of him.

Earlier this year prosecutors also confirmed that he was being formally investigated for a 600,000 Euro embezzlement.

David
 Allegranti, of Wired.it wrote:'After these insults against the 
English...it would be for his own good and ours that he was taken off 
Twitter.'
