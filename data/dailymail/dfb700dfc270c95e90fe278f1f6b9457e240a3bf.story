A woman in South Carolina has filed a missing person report on her son almost 20 years after he left home to follow the Grateful Dead.

Margaretta Evans, 63, told cops in Myrtle Beach that ‘she has not seen or heard from her son since early June of 1995,’ according to a report filed on Tuesday morning.

Jason Patrick Callahan, who would now be 38, is described by his mom as ‘approximately 5’ 10” to 6’ 00” in height and approximately 160 pounds’ with ‘wavy brown hair and brown eyes.’

Evans ‘advised that he left to follow the Grateful Dead at that time,’” states the police report. It doesn’t explain why Evans waited two decades to report her son missing, reports The Smoking Gun.

A number of Grateful Dead fans have gone missing over the years and Callahan could help solve the case of one unidentified man found dead at the side of the road after a car accident in 1995 and dubbed ‘Grateful Doe’.

The victim, who was killed in a June 26 car accident in Virginia, had Grateful Dead ticket stubs in his pocket at the time of his death, as well as a note addressed to ‘Jason.’

Cops investigating the murder at the time were hindered by the fact that the injuries to the man's face were so severe that authorities were unable to release a photo of him to the public.

His fingerprints were not in any law enforcement database and did not match any missing person reports either.

The only thing the coroner could determine was that the young man was between 15 and 21 years of age at the time of his death.

The unidentified man, known as 'Grateful Doe' attended Grateful Dead concerts in Washington in June 1995 - that turned out to be some of the last the band performed before singer Jerry Garcia died two months later

The stubs found in the man's pocket were from a Grateful Dead concert at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington D.C. on June 24 and 25, 1995. 

The two-day event had drawn fans from across the U.S., with an estimated 60,000 concertgoers in attendance. 

The concert was also of note to fans, as it was one of lead singer Jerry Garcia's last performances. He died of a heart attack less than two months later.

The ticket stubs, along with the appearance of the unidentified young man, which included a Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt from the 1995 summer tour, led investigators to believe the young man was a 'Deadhead,' a name given to fans of the Grateful Dead.

The driver of the vehicle was a South Carolina man, 21, who fell asleep at the wheel and also died in the crash.
