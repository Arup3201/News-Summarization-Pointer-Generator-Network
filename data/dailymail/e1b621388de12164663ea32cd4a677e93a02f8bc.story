Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS

Critics today dismissed claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana as a 'mystifying stunt' based on 'nonsense' evidence from an 'erratic' sniper in jail for illegally keeping guns at home.

Royal bodyguards and MPs have brushed off accusations that the Princess of Wales' death 16 years ago in Paris was carried out by British special forces who then 'covered it up'.

Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that 
officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing 
information handed to it ‘recently’ by the Royal Military Police.

But experts say that the evidence is flimsy and from a 'loose cannon' military man - known as Soldier N.

His extraordinary allegation emerged during the second court martial of 
Sergeant Danny Nightingale, who was found guilty of illegally possessing
 a gun and ammunition.

It was outlined in a letter written by Soldier N's mother-in-law, who was a key witness for the prosecution.

Ken Wharfe, who was Diana's Scotland Yard bodyguard told the Evening Standard: 'If this was 30 years ago the police desk sergeant would have thrown out this kind of nonsense before it went too far. But we live in different times.

'If
 these parents were so concerned that this information was relevant or 
had some general import, then they should have delivered it to the 
inquest.

'Why has it taken so long to air this new 
information? It seems so shallow to me. I just think it's a bit of a 
publicity stunt. For what reason I'm not certain, but in the absence of 
any real evidence, I'm sure this will go away', he added to the Daily Telegraph.

Colonel Tim Collins, a former SAS officer, added: 'It's utter nonsense. This is just wishful thinking on the part of somebody.' 

Another former soldier said: 'This is a preposterous claim and highly insulting to the name of the regiment which exists to serve Queen and country'.

Dai Davies, who was in charge of royal 
protection when Diana died said: 'I'm mystified ... how any new 
information can possibly allege anything other than [that] this was a 
tragic accident'.

Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel 

As well as hiding weapons in his 
house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked
 his son after mistaking him for the Taliban.

His children were also allegedly driven around in the boot of his Land Rover and he had hung his son 30ft above the ground in a tree.

The
 eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that 
had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’.

An inquest in 2008 found that Princess 
Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross 
negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who 
had been drinking.

The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said

Evidence which emerged at the weekend revealed that Soldier N is also accused of saying he
 could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother
 of his two children – would ‘disappear’.

The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed there was a murder plot

Sergeant 
Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a 
pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N.

Soldier
 N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the 
same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from 
whom he is now separated.

The letter was sent to Soldier N’s 
commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service 
Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial.

All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA.

The
 paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his 
wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that 
has been covered up.’

The
 letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of 
his unit use for private jobs’.

‘They put in the box the name, address 
and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to 
earn extra money does that job.’

When
 Soldier N was challenged by his mother-in-law, he is accused of saying:
 ‘Let me stop you right there – I kill women and I kill children.’

Scotland Yard confirmed officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it by the Royal Military Police. Pictured: The couple at the Ritz Hotel before they both died

The
 Metropolitan Police has confirmed officers are ‘scoping’ the details of
 the new information and ‘assessing its relevance and credibility’.

Pleased: The family of Henri Paul (pictured) who was driving Princess Diana when she died have welcomed the news that Scotland Yard are assessing information that she was killed by a SAS soldier

Former member of the Territorial SAS and now Tory MP for Canterbury and Whitstable, Julian Brazier, questioned why the Met have opened a new inquiry based on this evidence.

'I am very surprised by the police decision to start yet another inquiry based only on this extremely indirect testimony,' he said.

Henri Paul's mother Gisele 
said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al 
Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass.

Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997.

‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’

The
 new information was also welcomed by Dodi’s father, former Harrods 
owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who also insists the couple were murdered. He 
said he trusted the Metropolitan Police would investigate the new claims
 ‘with vigour’.

A royal spokesman said there would be no comment from the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry or Clarence House.
