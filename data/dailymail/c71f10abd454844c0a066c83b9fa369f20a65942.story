Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink hopes to manage in England but insists he does not want to be given a job based on the colour of his skin.

The former Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesborugh striker is on the lookout for a managerial vacancy having guided Royal Antwerp to seventh in the Belgian second division last season.

However, the 42-year-old, who has also coached at Nottingham Forest, doesn't want to be handed a job because he is black; Hasselbaink wants to be given a job because he is the right man for the role.

Speaking to The Independent on Sunday, Hasselbaink said: 'I think you should appoint someone because they are the right person, not because they are black or white. I wouldn't want to be waiting for an interview thinking they only asked me because I was black. I want to know they asked me because they think I can do the job.'

Following Chris Hughton's sacking as Norwich boss a month before the end of the season, at present, not one of the 92 League clubs in England has a black manager.

With a lack of black managers currently working in the English game, calls have been made for legislation to be introduced, similar to the Rooney rule in the NFL, which requires a minority candidate to be interviewed for all vacancies.

However, Hasselbaink is unsure whether there is a problem without knowing just how many black managers are applying for jobs and said: 'Is there racism against black managers? I don't know how to answer that because I don't know how many black managers are applying for jobs. If a lot of black managers are applying and not getting jobs then there is a problem, but I don't know if they are. I know Chris Hughton and Paul Ince are, but not many others.'

Hasselbaink is keen to return to England - his children attend school in this country - but wants to find the right club to manage.

'I am looking for the right opportunity, a club that is honest. It is not about money, it is about the challenge: where a club wants to go, how, and when they want to get there.'
