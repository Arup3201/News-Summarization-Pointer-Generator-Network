The Football Association will not be allowed to lay a wreath in Turin this week to mark the 30th anniversary of the Heysel disaster.

With England playing Italy at the Juventus Stadium on Tuesday, the FA wanted to take the opportunity to commemorate the deaths of 39 supporters before the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus by laying a wreath at a memorial outside the ground in Turin.

The Italian club said they appreciated the gesture, but rejected the offer, claiming they did not want to detract from their own memorial in May.

The FA said it respected Juventus' wishes.
