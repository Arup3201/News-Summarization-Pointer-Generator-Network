It's the latest app to take the smartphone by storm and you might have noticed that it's brought a touch of colour to your Facebook news feed.

Bitstrips allows users to turn themselves into a cartoon alter-ego and amuse (or perhaps annoy) their friends in the form of a digital comic strip.

But if you're already getting fed up your Facebook friends' attempts at cartoon humour, things are only going to get worse.

New craze: More than 11 million users have downloaded the Bitstrips app which creates a Facebook cartoon avatar of yourself

New way to post on Facebook: As well as the cartoons themselves, users post amusing taglines at the bottom of the image

A new, updated version of the app was released earlier this week - with more than 1,000 different cartoon templates to choose from.

The company first released the Facebook app back in December of last year.

But an iPhone version was only created at the end of September and updated, along with the release of an Android version this week.

Since its initial launch, the app has been downloaded a staggering 11million times and many people are seeing it as the new way to post a Facebook status.

Users create an avatar that resembles themselves and their friends - choosing different hairstyles and fashions to match their own.

Once you've perfected your avatar, you can adjust the amusing one liner below or coming from a speech bubble close to your character and post on it your wall.

Bitstrips CEO Jacob Blackstock told the Baltimore Sun in April: 'Bitstrips is hard to categorize because it's not a game.

'It's a new way to express yourself and interact with your friends. Instead of posting the same things as everyone else, you can create something that relates to your life.'

But many social media users are already fed up with the latest craze.

According to syracuse.com, Bitstrips has provoked a mixed response, with some gleefully delighting in creating their own cartoon form while others are failing to see the funny side.

One Twitter user described Bitstrips as the 'Crocs of Facebook.'

If the constant cartoon antics are beginning to get you down however, fear not - there is a way to hide Bitstrips from your newsfeed.

According to hypable.com, you hover over a Bitstrips post, click on the drop down menu in the top right corner and click 'Hide all from Bitstrips'.
