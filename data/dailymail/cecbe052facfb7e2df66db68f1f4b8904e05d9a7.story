Google's ‘mystery barge’ has finally floated to its new home in the California delta after the online enterprise was ordered to move it from San Francisco.

The 50ft tall, four-story vessel is made of recycled shipping containers and said to be part of a three-vessel fleet that would cost Google Inc. about $35 million.

After construction halted late last year when it emerged they lacked the proper building permits, Google decided to move the project, supposedly set to serve as an ‘interactive technology centre’ to Stockton.

Searching for a new home: The 50ft tall Google barge has now arrived at the Port of Stockton, California where construction is set to be finished and its mystery purpose finally revealed

The barge departed from Treasure Island, San Francisco, last month, and has now arrived at its new dock.

The
 final purpose of the barge has been debated for several months, with 
Google claiming it will be an ‘interactive technology center’, while the
 building company Turner Construction’s original papers described plans 
for a ‘floating retail store'.

However,
 various theories have been floated about its purpose. Among the most 
popular have been that Google is building a party boat where executives 
could schmooze with government leaders and important customers.

Google
 themselves have been enjoying the attention and gossip, and recently 
issued a light-hearted statement about the move to Stockton.

‘It's
 been a busy six months for our barge and it's grown tired of all the 
attention, so we are moving it to Stockton where it can have a break, 
enjoy the city's delicious asparagus, warmer climate and get a bit of 
rest before its next chapter,’ Google joked. 

I'm feeling lucky: There have been many theories about what the barge will be used for, including the official line of an 'interactive technology center' as well as a floating Google shop and a party boat

Long journey: The barge departed from Treasure Island, San Francisco (pictured) last month, and has now arrived at its new dock in Stockton, 80miles away

The vessel's new home is located about 80 miles east of San Francisco on the Sacramento-San Joaquin River delta.

The
 Port of Stockton falls outside the jurisdiction of the San Francisco 
Bay Conservation and Development Commission, the agency that forced the 
barge to leave Treasure Island.

‘It
 was an exciting morning for us,’ said Port of Stockton Director Richard
 Aschieris. ‘This doesn't happen every day. In fact I would probably say
 this is, from a maritime point of view, the highest visibility vessel 
we may have ever hosted.’

Unlike
 San Francisco, Stockton has never been a major tourist attraction. The 
city of roughly 300,000 people fell on such tough times that it filed 
for bankruptcy in 2012 and is still trying to reorganize its finances 
under court supervision.

Google's representatives signed an agreement that will allow the barge to be moored in Stockton for six months, Aschieris said.
