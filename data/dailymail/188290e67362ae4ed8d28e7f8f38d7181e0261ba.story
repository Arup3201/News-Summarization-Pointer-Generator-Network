A deputy U.S. marshal was  killed during a shootout at a Louisiana motel by a fugitive wanted on two counts of first-degree murder.

Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells, 27, was fatally shot around 11am on Tuesday at Elm Grove Motel in Scotlandville - an area north of Baton Rouge, according to Drew Wade, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service.

The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom, 31, from New Roads was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released.

Croom has been on the run since the February 18 shooting outside the Sugar Shack nightclub in Pointe Coupee that left Lechelle Rita Williams, 42, and her 38-year-old brother Sinica Lee Williams dead.

Wells, who was assigned to the Southern District office in Mississippi, was a part of a task force led by federal marshals, who were serving an arrest warrant when the shootout took place.

No other officers were hurt during the shooting, according to WBRZ.  

'Deputy marshals risk their lives every day going after the worst of the worst,' Wade said. 'This is a sad day for law enforcement.'

Wells was a graduate of East Central High School in Hurley, Mississippi, and also attended Jackson State University.

'He was a tremendous student,' East Central Principal James Hughey told WLOX-TV. 'He was very well liked.'

Wells comes from a law enforcement family, according to Mississippi state Rep. Manly Barton of Moss Point.

His father, Obie Wells Sr., is a retired Jackson County sheriff's deputy, and his brother, Obie Wells Jr., is an officer with the Jackson Police Department in the state capital.

Wells had been serving as Deputy Marshal since 2011, according to The Advocate.  

Croom has been charged in a federal criminal complaint with Wells' murder, but further details were not provided, said U.S. Attorney Walt Green of Louisiana's Middle District.

The fugitive had a lengthy criminal history between 2000-2014 that included attempted aggravated assault with a fire arm in 2001, aggravated second-degree battery in 2005, attempted second-degree murder in 2005 and 2014, according to an earlier report by NBC 33 News. 

Croom has been on the run since the February 18 shooting outside the Sugar Shack nightclub in Pointe Coupee that left Lechelle Rita Williams (left), 42, and her 38-year-old brother Sinica Lee Williams (right) dead

'He was a dangerous criminal,' said Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Beauregard Torres III. 'It was a very high price to pay for this warrant to bring this man into custody. It was a very, very high price.'

Investigators have not established a motive in the shootings of the brother and sister. 

The FBI will lead the investigation into the shooting death of Wells.
