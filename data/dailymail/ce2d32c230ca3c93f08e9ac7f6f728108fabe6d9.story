What did World Cup legends Paolo Rossi, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo have in common?

They were all 25-years-old when they played in the tournaments that made them all-time greats.

Going by recent history, 25 is the perfect age to enter a World Cup if you want to become a superstar.

Perfect age: Diego Maradona was a 25-year-old when he took the world by storm with Argentina

Talismen: Zinedine Zidane led France to victory in 1998 before Ronaldo did with Brazil in the 2002 tournament

Champion: A 25-year-old Paolo Rossi led Italy to World Cup victory in 1982 after returning from a two-year ban

And Mesut Ozil, Diego Costa and Alexis Sanchez are among the high-profile players who hope the tradition continues in Brazil 2014.

At 25, you’re still at the peak of your physical powers but have experience and know-how too.

Even more importantly, you should be able to handle pressure and bounce back from adversity.

Rossi won the 1982 World Cup for Italy having returned from a two-year ban for his part in a match-fixing scandal.

He didn’t score in his opening four games in the tournament, then bagged six in three game in including a famous hat-trick against Brazil.

Maradona couldn’t handle the expectation as a 21-year-old in 1982. Four years later, he was Argentina’s captain and main man in lifting the trophy, scoring or creating 10 goals in seven matches.

Zidane celebrated his 26th birthday right in the middle of the 1998 World Cup when he inspired France to win the trophy on home soil and cement his place in history.

Four years later, Brazil’s Ronaldo – who suffered a near-nervous breakdown before the 1998 World Cup final -  came back stronger and wiser at 25 to win the Golden Boot with eight goals as Brazil became world champions for a record fifth time.

Now, in 2014, a new generation of 25-year-olds are ready to take the world by storm.

Who's next? Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory and gave himself legendary status in 1986

MESUT OZIL, GERMANY

Mesmeric playmaker who sprinted away from Gareth Barry to destroy England’s World Cup hopes four years ago.

Had a difficult debut season in the Premier League with Arsenal, missing a crucial penalty against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, but loves the No10 role given to him by Germany coach Joachim Low.

‘We are travelling to Brazil to win the World Cup and show our thanks to the many fans in Germany and all over the world,’ says Ozil.

‘The most important thing for me is that I have been given the freedom to move either left or right, or even deep to pick up the ball. That suits me very well.’

The right age: Mesut Ozil destroyed England's hopes four years ago and is now 25 for the tournament in Brazil

ALEXIS SANCHEZ, CHILE

Hugely-talented Barcelona forward who began his World Cup with a goal and assist in Chile’s 3-1 win against Australia on Friday.

Having scored 19 La Liga goals last season, £25million Sanchez is entering the peak of his career and  Manchester United, Juventus and Liverpool are among the clubs monitoring his situation at the Nou Camp in case new manager Luis Enrique wants to make changes.

‘If I did not believe that Chile could be world champions, I would have stayed at home, watching the games on the TV,’ says the confident winger.

DIEGO COSTA, SPAIN

Controversially chose to play for his adopted Spain instead of Brazil and is key to their hopes of retaining the World Cup despite being substituted in a disastrous 5-1 defeat by Holland in their opening game on Friday.

Jose Mourinho is close to signing the £32million centre-forward from Atletico Madrid as a proper replacement for Didier Drogba and though Costa has been troubled by hamstring problems in the build-up to the World Cup, his physical presence gives Spain a different option.

May not have hit the ground running at Brazil 2014 but Rossi and others have shown in the past it’s how you finish rather than how you start that counts.

Target: £32million-rated striker Diego Costa opted for Spain over Brazil and could be key to their World Cup hopes

WILLIAN, BRAZIL

One of four Chelsea players named by Felipe Scolari in Brazil’s squad and though he didn’t feature in the opening-night victory against Croatia, his athleticism and power will be needed as the tournament progresses.

Scolari is a huge Willian fan and he named is as one of the eight certainties in the Brazil squad back in April – two months before he had to finalise his squad.

PAULINHO, BRAZIL

There wasn’t a single Spurs player in the England World Cup squad – but Paulinho not only made the 23-man party for hosts Brazil, he started the win against Croatia as a midfield enforcer to help protect the home defence.

Paulinho scored nine goals for Tottenham in his debut season in England and his all-round play in the Brazilian engine room makes him an important component in the team.

GIOVANI DOS SANTOS, MEXICO

Too lightweight to make it in the Premier League with Spurs but his dazzling skills are made for a World Cup.

Sensational in Mexico’s win against Cameroon on Friday, and was wrongly denied two goals after wrongly being called offside.

AXEL WITSEL, BELGIUM

While Premier League fans know all about Eden Hazard and Vincent Kompany, Belgian supporters regard Witsel of Russian club Zenit St Petersburg as the most important individual in their team.

Witsel is the heartbeat of the Belgian side, their Roy Keane who protects the back four and drives everyone else on.

Belgian are World Cup dark horses, and Witsel may be a dark horse for player of the tournament. He’s certainly the right age!

The unknown: Axel Witsel can inspire Belgium in Brazil and is at the heart of the side - their 'Roy Keane'

Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa, Willian, Paulinho, Giovani dos Santos and Axel Witsel are all the perfect age... 25
