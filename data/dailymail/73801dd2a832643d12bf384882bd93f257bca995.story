Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask for her name to be removed from stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane if the club offer convicted rapist Ched Evans a contract.

Olympic champion Ennis-Hill is the latest in a string of patrons to threaten withdrawing their support of the club after Evans was invited back to train with former team-mates after being released from prison.

Mrs Ennis-Hill, who won heptathlon gold at London 2012, said reinstating the footballer would contradict her view that role models ought to set a good example for young fans in a statement this evening.

'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example.

'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.' 

Her comments come after the resignations of patrons Charlie Webster, Lindsay Graham and sixties pop star Dave Berry, amid fears Evans will be resigned by the football club.

The League One side confirmed on Tuesday evening that it had agreed to allow Evans to take part in training with their players, but the 25-year-old has failed to appear ever since.

MailOnline understands the convicted rapist was due to start training in Sheffield  but he never arrived and on Thursday was out shopping 50 miles away in Cheshire.

The return of Evans to his old team has sparked a massive backlash.

Two of Sheffield United’s top sponsors also threatened to tear up their contracts if he was permanently signed to the team.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg - a Sheffield MP - said Evans should consider moving abroad to play football because  United should not take him back.

Mr Clegg said footballers were not ‘just any old employee, they’re also role models’. 

Miss Webster, 32, said she herself had been a victim of sexual abuse, adding: ‘I resign as patron of Sheffield United and Sheffield United Community Foundation, which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport.

‘No convicted rapist, as in Ched Evans, should go back to the club that I am patron of.

‘He’s not just going into a job. . . he’s influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is.’

Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes near their Cheshire home on Thursday as it was revealed the convicted rapist did not rejoin former team-mates at United

Evans and Massey became engaged following the footballer's release from prison where he served half of a sentence over the rape of a teenager in Wales. Their outing came as patrons of the club resigned 

Evans failed to appear at Sheffield United's training grounds despite being told he could return to train with former team-mates, instead emerging in exercise clothing in Cheshire with his partner Natasha Massey

On Wednesday morning she posted on Twitter: ‘Overwhelmed by the level of your support. I am so heartened to see that the vast majority are standing with me & saying that this isn’t okay.’ It is unclear whether Evans, 25, will play for the club again, but he will train at its grounds.

He was released last month, still protesting his innocence, after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in Rhyl, North Wales.

Last night campaign group the End Violence Against Women Coalition said it was ‘appalled’.

Nick Clegg told LBC: 'If it was me, I wouldn't take him on. This is an incredibly serious offence, a very serious offence for which he has been convicted and that's what sets this apart.

'He maybe could play for a club abroad for a while before coming back.'

Some 155,000 people have added their names to a petition demanding United, nicknamed the Blades, refuse to sign him. 

The team’s shirt sponsor, John Holland car sales, warned it would consider tearing up its contract if the Blades re-sign Evans as it ‘condemns rape and violence of any kind against women’. DBL Logistics, whose name is on the back of the club’s shirts, also threatened to withdraw its support.

Paul Blomfield, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, wrote in an open letter to club chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps: ‘It’s because I care so much about our club that I am writing to urge you to reconsider your decision... The way this issue has been handled by the club is dragging our name through the mud and dividing fans.’

The footballer raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted him saying: ‘I’ve got a bird.’ 

Evans, who has played 13 times for Wales, admitted having sex but denied rape. The woman said she had no memory of the incident and prosecutors said she was too drunk to consent.

The family of Evans’s fiancee, Natasha Massey, 25, have helped to fund a highly controversial website claiming he is innocent.

Evans, a former Manchester City player, moved to third-tier Sheffield in 2009 before being convicted in April 2012.

On Tuesday, Sheffield United issued a statement saying there was ‘no place for mob justice’ in the situation. It read: ‘The board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA’s request and to allow Mr Evans to train at the club’s facilities.

‘While some have speculated about whether the club will or should invite Mr Evans to return to SUFC as a registered footballer, the club is not prepared at this time to decide that issue.’
