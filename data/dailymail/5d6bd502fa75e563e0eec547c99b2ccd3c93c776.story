These are the incredible images of mushrooms that could be magic.

However, this effect is anything but supernatural, and rather highlights one of the fascinating aspects of nature.

Here some of the 65 species of bioluminescent mushrooms are seen lighting up at night - although they are luminous throughout the day as well.

These are the incredible images that prove mushrooms really are magic. Taylor Lockwood, 68, has hunted through the rainforests of the world to capture the stunning pictures of the bioluminescent mushrooms as they emit a stunning green glow

Taylor Lockwood, 68,  hunted through the rainforests of the world to capture the stunning pictures of the bioluminescent mushrooms as they emit a stunning green glow.

The effect is triggered by a chemical reaction between luciferin, a light-emitting pigment, and the enzyme luciferase.

It can occur in fungi as well as in a range of animals including jellyfish, squid, scorpions and other insects.

The photographer, from New Orleans, has travelled to countries around the world, including Brazil, China and Madagascar, to capture the brightly lit fungi on camera.

He said: 'I moved to Northern California thirty years ago from New Orleans and I saw some beautiful mushrooms outside my cabin.

'I bought a camera that week to get some pictures and the rest as they say is history.

'I've done many shoots over the years - too many to recall.

'But without doubt, one of the greatest was the night I photographed the bioluminescent Mycena lucentipes under the full moon in Brazil.'

Bioluminescent mushrooms emit light 24 hours per day but are best observed at night. There are about 85,000 species in the fungi kingdom and around just 65 of them are thought to be luminescent.

Mr Lockwood continued: 'This kind of work makes me feel like a vampire - I sleep during the day and as the light fades to dark my blood starts to run thinner and my heart gets excited at the thought of walking through the forest at night.

'I have to cover my face, neck and arms with insect repellent to keep the bites to a minimum.

'In certain parts of the world there are animals such as jaguars but the thought of seeing that glow after waiting all day long makes me forget about any danger.'Â 

The glowing effect is seen all over the various species of mushroom and shines both night and day
