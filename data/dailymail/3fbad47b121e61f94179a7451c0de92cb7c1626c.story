A Las Vegas-area teenager who had been sought in the U.S. and along the Mexican border following the butcher knife slayings of his mother and younger brother was arrested Wednesday while he sat alone in a food court on the Las Vegas Strip.

An unidentified tipster who recognized Adrian Navarro-Canales from media reports told Henderson police the 16-year-old was at the food court at the Showcase mall, police spokesman Keith Paul said.

Navarro-Canales offered no resistance when police approached him at about 10:30 a.m.

'He was sitting at a table,' Paul said. 'The two detectives walked up to him and took him into custody.'

Navarro-Canales was booked into juvenile detention at the Clark County Detention Center in downtown Las Vegas to await an initial court appearance.

Paul said investigators think Navarro-Canales walked the 9 miles to the Strip from the suburban apartment where the bloody bodies of his mother, Elvira Canales-Gomez, 40, and brother, Cesar Navarro, 9, had been found Friday.

They don't believe he returned to the apartment, and they were still trying to determine where he had been staying.

Canales-Gomez's niece, Ana Martinez, 23, told investigators her cousin didn't have any friends that she knew of in the Las Vegas area, didn't like living in the United States and wanted to go back to Mexico. She described Navarro-Canales as anti-social and said he spent most of his time in the apartment playing video games.

The mall, next to the MGM Grand casino-resort, is marked by giant M&M and Coca-Cola displays, several shoe and apparel retailers, and an eight-plex movie theater. It also features a video arcade.

Navarro-Canales was enrolled as a junior
at Coronado High School in Henderson but hadn't attended classes since 
school began in August, Clark County School District spokeswoman Melinda
Malone said.

Police launched a national manhunt for Navarro-Canales after the bodies were found Friday. He was initially thought to be a possible victim before detectives named him as the prime suspect in the slayings. He will be prosecuted as an adult.

The bodies of were discovered in the bathroom of their Henderson apartment three days after detectives believe they were killed on September 17. Canales-Gomez still had a butcher's knife lodged in her chest, police said.

Navarro-Canales was nowhere to be found, and police had been searching for six days in Nevada and surrounding states as well as the Mexican border for the teen.

Henderson police investigators think 
the killings happened Tuesday, but the bodies weren't discovered until 
Friday — the fourth time a relative and the mother's boyfriend called to
say they were worried about whether he, Elvira Canales-Gomez and Cesar 
Navarro were OK.

Henderson police spokesman Keith Paul said officers 'found no cause to break in' during the first three visits.

'On Friday, we had family members saying they tried several times to contact (Canales-Gomez) and couldn't reach her,' he said.

A
Henderson police officer fetched a key from property managers and was 
hit as he entered the apartment by the pungent smell of decomposing 
bodies, the police report said.

The mom was found dead on the bathroom floor with multiple stab wounds and Cesar, 9, was found in the bathtub. He had been stabbed once.

Adrian Navarro-Canales — who 
celebrated his 16th birthday on September 16 with his mother, brother 
and mother's boyfriend at the apartment — was missing.

Paul said investigators think Navarro-Canales acted alone. Despite being
a minor, Navarro-Canales has been named because of the seriousness of 
the crime and to assist in the manhunt for him, which has now come to a close.

The police spokesman said 
Navarro-Canales' name had been entered in a national crime database and 
authorities on the Mexico border had been notified during the search.

The police report said the teen's 
passport and border documents were found in the apartment in the quiet 
complex off Eastern Avenue and Sunridge Heights Parkway. The mother's 
vehicle was found parked outside.

Police went to the apartment 
Wednesday afternoon and twice on Thursday — after calls from 
Canales-Gomez's boyfriend, Carlos Rubio-Villanueva, and the niece. Paul 
said officers found the front door locked and windows secure.

Killed: According to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez, pictured, drove home from work about 3:40 p.m.

According
to the police report, investigators think the mother and boy were 
stabbed to death September 17, after Canales-Gomez drove home from work 
about 3:40 p.m., and Cesar was last seen at school.

Police said Navarro-Canales might have stayed in the apartment at least one night before fleeing.

Rubio-Villanueva told investigators he noticed a kitchen light was off when he visited the apartment late September 17; when he stopped on his way to work Wednesday afternoon and summoned Henderson police to the apartment; and off again when he checked after work shortly before midnight Wednesday.

Police said it appeared Navarro-Canales texted his father on Wednesday, telling him the others were fine and couldn't talk because they were asleep.

The teen's father, Adrian Navarro Soto-Mayor, flew Friday from San Jose, California, to Las Vegas and issued a weekend plea in Spanish for his son to contact him or other family members.
