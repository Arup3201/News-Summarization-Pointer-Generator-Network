The Philadelphia Eagles are on the brink of elimination from the playoff race after a 27-24 loss to the Washington Redskins.

Kai Forbath kicked a 26-yard field goal with five seconds remaining to snap the Redskins' six-game losing streak.

The Eagles lost their third in a row to fall to 9-6. They need the Dallas Cowboys to lose their final two games to have a shot at repeating as NFC East champions. 

Mark Sanchez turned the ball over twice as the Eagles' season continues to unravel

Washington won for the first time in seven games as the NFC East turned in the Dallas Cowboys' favour

Mark Sanchez committed two turnovers for the Eagles, including an interception that led to the winning field goal.

The Redskins improved to 4-11. Robert Griffin III returned as the Washington starter and won in his first complete game in more than a year. He went 16 for 23 for 220 yards with one interception. 

In Santa Clara, California, the 49ers looked set to eliminate the Chargers from the play-off hunt when quarterback Colin Kaepernick completed an astonishing 90-yard touchdown run late in the third, the second longest by a QB in NFL history.

The Chargers were down by 14 points after three quarters but Rivers responded magnificently, throwing two touchdown passes, the second an 11-yard effort to Malcolm Floyd with just 29 seconds left to send the game to overtime and they eventually won 38-35.

The result does not guarantee San Diego (9-6) a spot in the play-offs, but it gives them a fighting chance.

'I was the main reason we were in that big hole (at half-time), but it's awesome to fight back to win,' Rivers said.

'We said this is the first round of the playoffs for us. We won the first round. We've got a long way to go though.'
