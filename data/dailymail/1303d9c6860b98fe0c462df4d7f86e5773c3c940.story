Two days of rain has soothed the parched landscape of California, though relief has also brought flooded roadways and traffic jams in some areas.

Reservoirs swelled and waterfalls sprung back to life on Wednesday, as officials monitored for  flooding and mudslides that were possible after one of California's worst years of drought on record.

A sinkhole in San Francisco was being blamed on the heavy storm, which also dumped snow over mountains and brought water back to the waterfalls of Yosemite National Park.

The park's 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls, which had nearly dried up by mid-July, came roaring back to life.

'With the precipitation, they are looking good. They are flowing nicely,' park spokeswoman Ashley Mayer said. 

One area, Yucaipa Ridge up in the San Bernardino Mountains, had received 8.38 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service.

CBS reports that slick roads and flooding on highways led to an uptick in accident reports across the state.

On Wednesday, the agency reported that local California Highway Patrol dispatchers had logged 101 crash reports between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m.

There were 328 throughout the day on Tuesday, according to the agency, compared to 50 to 75 crashes on a normal non-rainy day.

Officials said that, in spite of this week's rainfall, much more would be needed to reverse three years of drought conditions in the state.

The Association of California Water Services notes that the 2014 water year, which ended September 30, was the fourth driest in California's history.

The drought made terrain in some areas susceptible to mudslides from flash floods on Tuesday.

Residents in Camarillo Springs were forced to evacuate around 75 homes as rushing water brought mud flowing through the foothills 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

Homeowners were urged to remain outside the area even after the evacuation order was lifted, though no damage was reported.

Silverado Canyon also had a voluntary evacuation notice in place for around 60 homes in an area that had experienced large fires and mudslides previously.

The rain is expected to last through Thursday, and has allowed much of the San Francisco Bay Area to catch up to or exceed normal annual rainfall levels.

The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which holds much of the water supply in the state, was at just 24 percent of its average level before the storms.

Snow has built quickly, with some areas experiencing snowfall of 10 inches at elevations of 8,000 feet.
