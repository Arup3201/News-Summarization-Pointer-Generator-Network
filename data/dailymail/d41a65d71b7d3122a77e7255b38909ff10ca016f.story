Sentenced: Glamour model and escort Lady Jet Black British Barbie was spared jail today after admitting to racially abusing and spitting at an Asian taxi driver

A glamour model and escort called Lady Jet Black British Barbie was spared jail today after admitting to racially abusing and spitting at an Asian taxi driver.

The 32-year-old, who appeared in court with a totally shaven head, assaulted Ramin Sasani, 25, outside David Lloyd Leisure Centre in Chigwell.

During an earlier hearing , the court heard that Barbie had called the cab driver rude when 
he didn’t thank her after she paid the £4 fare.

She then become hysterical and leant in through the door of the cab
and attacked him. She had to be pulled back by a passer-by.

Mr Sasani said the model had shouted: 'You are a f*****g immigrant, go back to your own country you f*****g Paki.'

He added: 'She shouted "If you call the police I’m going to tell them you tried to rape me." She then spat at him in the face.

The
model, from Woodford Green, whose name was Natalie Springer until she 
changed it six years ago, was prosecuted under the name Jet Black 
British Barbie.

After pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to racially aggravated common assault, she was sentenced today at Chelmsford Magistrates court.

She was given a one year community order, which includes a requirement that she must carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

After passing sentence, chair of the bench, Paul Jee, said: 'This was a nasty offence with a number of aggravating features. People were present, the victim was operating a public service, it had an on-going effect on him and spitting is a nasty thing to do.

'It is humiliating and there is a risk from disease being transmitted.

'However, this was an isolated incident and you wish to apologise to the cab company.'

Representing her, Stuart Cowan, said : 'You would have read how she makes her living and may not agree with it, but she pays her taxes.

'She has lived at the bottom of society and does not want to return there. She has a nice place to live, possessions, and a life style which agrees with her.'

He said that the taxi driver had 
refused to deliver her to the doors of the leisure centre instead, 
stopping at the gates and 'snatched the money out of her hand.'

But he said that she accepted that what she did was 'wholly inappropriate'.

She had claimed at an earlier hearing that she was provoked by 
the cabbie calling her 'a n****r'. And she claimed that at the time she 
was tired after working all night, and was annoyed at the way he didn’t 
thank her when she handed over a £10 note.

But Chelmsford Magistrates had ruled that she 
was not provoked and that Mr Sasani had not called her a “n****r.”

He denied he snatched the £10 note from her hand or said 'No-one likes you anyway, n****r'.

Barbie admitted grabbing and shaking him, spitting, and shouting that she would claim he had raped her.

She also told magistrates she had nothing to hide about her work as a glamour model in the adult industry and in escorting.

She said she was regarded as 'a bit of a celebrity' and she shaved her head as a personal campaign against slavery and racism.

A regular church-goer, she denied she was a violent person and said she lived a quiet life in her village adding : 'I don’t class myself as a racist person.'

She said she had not felt comfortable with Mr Sasani because he had stared at her in the rear view mirror and asked questions about what she did.

'I obviously get naked for a living and do have guys who fancy me but if I am paying someone I just want a job done. I’m professional and I expect people to be professional,' she had told the court.

She had added : 'I have had racism in the past. I have been called an orangutan, a c**n, a spade, but that particular day when I was called a n****r that was the cherry on the cake. I was very tired from the night before. I was pre-menstrual. That’s why I reacted that way.'

Following the hearing, the model was told she must also pay £620 legal costs, £60 victim surcharge, and £250 compensation.
