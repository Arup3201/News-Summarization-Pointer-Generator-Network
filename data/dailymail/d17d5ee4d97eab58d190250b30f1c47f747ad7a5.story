A Virginia mother, a hairdresser, has been arrested after her toddler daughter died when she left her alone in a car while she cut a client's hair.

Tabitha Inge, 28, left her two-year-old daughter Mikayla Thurston alone in her car outside a Chesterfield mobile home Tuesday while she went inside to style a client's hair.

Police believe the child died when her neck and head became trapped in the partially opened window of the car parked at the Parkway Trailer Park.

Ongoing investigation: Police are unsure if little Mikayla Thurston opened the car window herself

The investigation indicates the child was left unattended in a vehicle and her head and neck became trapped between the car’s window and door frame,” Chesterfield Police said in a statement about the arrest.

It's unclear how long the child was left in the car, but Inge reportedly went outside to check on her child around 9:40pm and made the awful discovery.

A neighbor at the trailer park told WTVR that Inge ran back into the home screaming hysterically.

'Somebody call the police. My baby is dead,' Inge screamed, the neighbor said.

He called 911 and emergency services were dispatched to the property.

Mikayla was taken to VCU Medical Center where she was pronounced dead.

While the girl's body has been sent to a state medical examiner to determine the cause of death, Chesterfield County police Lieutentant P.J. McCann says the child was caught in the partially opened window. McCann says investigators are trying to determine whether the child had touched the car's power window switches.

The child's grandfather, Larry Inge, says the girl's mother had stopped at a home to drop off hair products and left the child in the car.

Inge was arrested and charged with felony child neglect Thursday.

She is scheduled to appear in Chesterfield County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Friday afternoon.
