The men expected to carry the can for England’s World Cup humiliation will attempt to ride the storm swirling around their embarrassing exit and plough on into an Ashes summer.

Paul Downton, the managing director who has endured a torrid first 14 months in office, gave his full backing to beleaguered coach Peter Moores on Tuesday while making it clear he expects the full support of the ECB.

Downton has had to make some momentous decisions since replacing Hugh Morris in the wake of England’s 5-0 Ashes debacle and it was his call to bring back Moores for a second spell as coach that is most under the spotlight now.

Peter Moores' place as England coach is safe in the short-term, says ECB managing director Paul Downton

Downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff, including Moores, would be made immediately but a review will take place 

Moores is fighting for his credibility at international level after England failed to live up to any expectations at the World Cup by crashing to a first-round exit sealed by defeat against Bangladesh.

Yet Downton, who called Moores the ‘outstanding coach of his generation’ when preferring him to Ashley Giles, was adamant that nothing had changed when he addressed England’s worst World Cup of all from London on Tuesday.

‘Peter is an outstanding coach and I don’t think 10 months is a fair amount of time for him to prove that, particularly when we have spent the last six of those playing one-day cricket and trying to catch up,’ said Downton.

‘Clearly as head coach he feels responsible for what has happened but we all feel responsible frankly, because we feel we’ve let the country down and nobody wants to do that.

‘Everybody’s still raw but no decisions are going to be made in the short-term. In less than a month we will be playing in the West Indies so I don’t expect anything to change before then.

‘I’m not saying everybody’s job is safe and I’m not saying everybody’s going to get sacked. It feels as though, from your perspective, there needs to be a scapegoat or a target.

‘We’re in a transitional period and it will take time. It’s too early to talk of definites in terms of “he’s going or staying”.’

The question now is whether English cricket’s two new bosses agree with Downton because if they do not, incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves and new chief executive Tom Harrison will have a big call to make. England are due to name their Test party to tour the Caribbean next Tuesday and if they want to get rid of Moores, they have to move quickly.

‘I’ve worked with Colin Graves over the last year and he’s been extremely supportive,’ said Downton, whose position would be untenable if his superiors moved to replace Moores. ‘We spoke yesterday and had a meeting through most of the game.

‘Tom has been with us two months and we’ve spent a lot of time together. They want English cricket to improve as I do but let’s not fudge around it. We’re trying desperately hard to drive the team forward. There are no quick fixes.’

So does Downton expect himself and Moores to still be in place come the first Ashes Test in July, before which England have to play a revitalised New Zealand in Test and one-day series after returning home from the Caribbean?

It’s imperative England begin again in one-day cricket with a young, vibrant side in tune with the modern 50-over game and give them as much experience as possible before the next World Cup in 2019.

WHO SHOULD GO?

So the group of senior players who have failed to produce the goods at this World Cup must all go now — that means Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad should all concentrate on Test cricket. Captain Eoin Morgan needs to regain his form if he is to prove that he may yet have a future with England in limited-overs cricket. It should now also be the end of the road for Ravi Bopara and James Tredwell.

WHO SHOULD STAY?

England need to build a new one-day team around the core of Joe Root, who should be the new captain, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali. They can be supplemented by Chris Woakes, James Taylor and Chris Jordan while Gary Ballance may yet grow into the modern one-day batsman familiar to Yorkshire, and Steven Finn remains an enigma who should not be discarded in any form just yet.

WHO SHOULD COME IN?

England need players who can carry them forward now.

Step forward Alex Hales, who has to be given a proper run in 50-over cricket, Surrey’s Jason Roy, Kent’s exciting batsman-keeper Sam Billings, Yorkshire’s Adil Rashid to spin the ball away from the right-handers, Hampshire’s classy batsman James Vince and Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes.

It is crucial for England to find a left-arm quick bowler — and Essex’s Reece Topley may be the best bet for our 2019 squad.

Downton says incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves, who did not appoint him, has been supportive

‘That’s the plan. Absolutely,’ said Downton.’

The problem for England is the dearth of quality alternatives to Moores, particularly as some of the leading coaches in the world in Gary Kirsten, Stephen Fleming and the man the ECB would most like — Jason Gillespie — do not want the year-round slog of international cricket.

Downton made some valid points on Tuesday about the volume of cricket and the need for England to create as different a one-day team from the Test side as possible. But he knows he can only call England a team in transition for so long.

This summer’s Ashes will determine the validity of much of what Downton has done over the last 14 months and there was yet another reminder yesterday of the first of his seismic decisions, sacking Kevin Pietersen.

Did Graves give Pietersen a glimmer of hope when he told the BBC last week that the exiled star might be considered again if he played county cricket? ‘The position hasn’t changed,’ said Downton. ‘What Colin said was right. To be picked by England you have to be scoring an awful lot of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors to be a positive influence.’

Downton was lost for words when asked if he would meet Pietersen to discuss his situation. ‘He hasn’t asked for a meeting,’ said Downton. Then, after a pause: ‘I don’t know what to say to that. It’s not at the forefront of the selectors’ minds — nothing has changed with regards to Kevin in the last year.’

Yet until England start winning regularly the Pietersen question will go on being asked of Downton, not to mention those questions over the ability of Moores to finally prove he belongs with England.

l England have injury concerns over Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali ahead of their dead-rubber final World Cup match against Afghanistan on Friday.

THE HISTORY: Afghanistan played their first ODI in 2009 but their record is not as bad as you might expect. They have won 25 of their 50 ODIs, but most of those came against the likes of Scotland, Holland and Canada.

THE FORM: Not good. But then neither is England’s. Afghanistan have lost four of their five World Cup matches. They won the other by one wicket with three balls to go against Scotland.

THE PLAYERS: Samiullah Shenwari could cause some damage. He has scored 247 runs this tournament at an average of 49.40. That’s more runs and a better average than any England batsman has managed. With the ball, left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran (right) has been the pick of the bunch, taking 10 wickets at an average of 24.

HEAD TO HEAD: England have never played Afghanistan in a one-day game, but they did meet at the ICC World Twenty20 in 2012 in Colombo. An England side featuring Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler hit 196 before skittling Afghanistan for 80.
