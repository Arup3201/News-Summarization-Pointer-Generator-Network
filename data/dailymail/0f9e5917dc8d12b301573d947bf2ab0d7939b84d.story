A teenage boy has managed to survive a shark attack by tearing the animal off him while it was biting his leg.

15-year-old Garrett Sebesta was praised for his bravery following the incident, which occurred yesterday in waist-high water off the Gulf Coast in Texas.

He has apparently been left with a seven-inch gash in his leg from the bite, and severe damage to his hand.

Emergency: 15-year-old Garrett Sebesta was airlifted to hospital after being bitten by a shark

Garrett was swimming with friends from a church group in the resort of Surfside Beach, on the outskirts of Houston.

He felt a shark bite in to his left leg and immediately grabbed it and pulled it off him.

But the animal continued its attack, biting his hand until he finally managed to shake it off and it swam away.

The teenager was helped out of the water by his friends before being tended to by paramedics.

He was airlifted to a hospital in Houston, where he underwent surgery on Monday evening.

Garrett suffered a seven-inch-deep circular wound in his leg as well as nerve damage in his hand, his mother told KHOU.

'He was a trooper,' medic Suandra Monnat told My Fox Houston. 'This kid felt the shark bite his calf, and then literally grabbed the shark and tore it off of him.'

Local officials said it had been more than two decades since the last shark attack in the area, where jellyfish stings are a much more common complaint.

Caught: Shortly before Monday's attack, this shark was found in shallow water in the same area

However, in the past few days a shark which was several feet long was caught in shallow waters off Surfside Beach.

Ms Monnat advised swimmers to avoid going near fishermen, as they tend to attract dangerous animals with their bait.
