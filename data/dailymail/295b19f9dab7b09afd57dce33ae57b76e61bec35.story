He had only gone on the internet to buy a birthday card for his mother.

But 12-year-old Declan Hind ended up costing his father £7,000 after being lured into the world of online poker.

The schoolboy, already a poker expert from playing the game on free smartphone ‘apps’ with his friends, could not resist the temptation to play for real stakes.

Addiction: Keith Hind with his son Declan who spent £7,000 on gambling websites

Armed with his father Keith’s credit card details, he quickly lost hundreds of pounds.

And his efforts to recoup the money before he was caught only saw his losses snowball.

Now the family have joined  forces 
with a child protection  charity to raise awareness of how young people 
can fall victim to online gambling.

Figures last year suggested that as 
many as 60,000 children are problem gamblers. Experts say young people 
are encouraged by free online games to enjoy gambling, only to find 
themselves sucked into the real thing.

Declan, of Maghull, Merseyside, had 
borrowed his father’s credit card to buy his mother a birthday card from
the Moonpig website.

Once online, he succumbed to 
temptation and went on an unconnected poker site, simply saying that he 
was over 18 to  start gambling.

He said yesterday: ‘It started off in school. My mate got into the poker games, it was free to download, we were all doing it.

‘It was all virtual money but I  got 
really good at it, I was making loads. I went on to one of the poker 
websites and put all the information in.

‘I started making a bit, but not as much as I was losing.’

Desperate to win back the money he had
lost on his father’s card, Declan carried on playing, digging himself 
even deeper into a hole.

Addictive: Declan is now volunteering for a charity so he can warn other families about the dangers of underage gambling

He was too ashamed to admit what he 
had done even when his father, a 52-year-old lorry driver, found out to 
his shock that his credit limit had been exceeded and his card was 
blocked.

Mr Hind said yesterday: ‘I was screaming and shouting at the credit card company, I didn’t know what had happened.’

Declan, now 13, kept quiet for a week,
wiping all the online games off the home computer in an effort to cover
his tracks before he finally confessed. ‘I was mad, really livid, for 
weeks, but I was also shocked,’ said Mr Hind. ‘It was so easy for him to
do it.’

As no fraud had taken place, Mr Hind had to pay the bill 
himself, which totalled £7,000 including interest.

Now he is working with child 
protection charity Prevention Town to produce information packs for 
school and raise awareness of the pitfalls of online gambling.

Charity director Ross Carroll said: 
‘Parents need to be aware of what their children are doing online, and 
these sites also have a responsibility to carry out proper checks that 
gamblers are over 18.’

Controversially, Mr Hind is organising a charity poker tournament in Monaco to raise money to support Prevention Town.

According to the charity GamCare, 2 
per cent of youngsters  aged 12 to 16 have a gambling problem, more than
twice the rate among adults.
