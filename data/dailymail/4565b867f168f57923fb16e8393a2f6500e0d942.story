The BBC has been accused of fostering a 'macho' culture after interviewing fewer women experts on its news programmes than rival broadcasters.

Radio 4's Today programme invited an average of five male experts for every woman in November, while the Ten O'Clock News featured more men by a ratio of four to one.

By comparison, ITV's News at Ten had a ratio of three to one in favour of male guests and Sky News achieved parity on nearly half of its broadcasts. Researchers from City University in London counted the number of male and female experts invited onto news programmes for ten months last year.

Under fire: Today has been criticised for having a disproportionate amount of male guests

Critics have accused the Corporation of failing to make enough effort to book women on its programmes.

In November, the Today programme came under fire for inviting only male experts for a discussion of breast cancer. At one point, presenter John Humphreys even asked a male contributor to imagine he was a woman.

The programme has also been criticised for relying on male journalists. Of its five regular presenters, just one, Sarah Montague, is a woman.

Miriam O'Reilly, who won an ageism case against the BBC last year after she was dropped as a Countryfile presenter, said: 'The BBC newsrooms are quite macho, in that there are more male producers than women.

'But they need to make an effort to change their ways. If other broadcasters can improve, I don't see why the BBC can't do better.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'Everyone can agree there should be better gender balance in the media but, like all broadcasters, we have to reflect the world as it is. 

'It's a fact there are fewer women than men at senior levels in business, politics and world affairs.That is bound to be reflected in our output but we are aiming to increase the number of female contributors across BBC News and we are making headway.

'We feel this relatively small snapshot doesn’t represent the range of well-known female presenters and correspondents that work across BBC News but nonetheless it continues to be a priority for us to improve the representation of women on our programmes.'

City University’s director of broadcasting Lis Howell, who conducted the research, said the results were 'dire’.

Call for change: Miriam O'Reilly, who won an ageism cases against BBC, said its newsrooms are 'macho'

She said: 'The Ten O’Clock News has been the worst performer at all. Its ratio of male to female guests is terrible. There have been no recent signs of change on this issue by the BBC.

'They don’t seem to be taking it seriously at all, whereas other broadcasters cave certainly improved over the year. The BBC should be ashamed of itself.

'When women are invited on the BBC they tend to be the victims of diseases or crimes rather than authority figures. On hard news stories about the economy or politics, the BBC resorts to men.

'But this is not because women are not interested in appearing on TV or be interviewed on the radio, or because there are not enough female experts.

'It is a matter of making an effort to change the same old faces and bring in new talent.'
