A groom was forced to miss most of his own wedding after rushing from the altar to hospital with a serious case of food poisoning brought on by a sausage and egg McMuffin he had for breakfast.

Carly Hutchinson had to prove her vow of 'in sickness and in health' when her new husband Dylan Lane started vomiting at their wedding ceremony at Sellicks Hill, south of Adelaide, on Saturday.

When Mr Lane started buckling over in pain as the couple were posing for photos, they rushed to Noarlunga Hospital where he spent an hour being treated, the Advertiser reports.

Ms Hutchinson was pictured standing by her husband's hospital bed in her wedding dress as she informed guests on Facebook that they should enjoy the reception until they returned.

The groom put his illness down to food poisoning from a dodgy burger he bought from the Aldinga McDonalds the morning of the wedding. 

'He was throwing up before the ceremony, but he thought it was nerves. Then he ran for the toilet as soon as the service was done,' Ms Hutchinson said.

'He got back to the reception and sat out the back for a couple of hours slumped over and sick before he was taken home. 

'He was not even able to make his speech as he was too sick.'

Ms Hutchinson told social media followers her groom wasn't even aware of what the cake looked like until she showed him a photo the following day.

'Thanks everyone for celebrating on (Dylan's) behalf with me last night. Obviously not the ideal situation but seemed like everyone managed to have fun without him,' she wrote on Facebook. 

Three other guests at the wedding, including a groomsman, also fell ill in the 24 hours after eating at the same McDonalds, according to Ms Hutchinson.  

She called the fast food restaurant on Sunday after the wedding, but was left disappointed with their response.

Ms Hutchinson has now lodged a formal complaint with McDonald's regional operations office and with the local council's environmental health officer.

McDonalds Australia say they are investigating.
