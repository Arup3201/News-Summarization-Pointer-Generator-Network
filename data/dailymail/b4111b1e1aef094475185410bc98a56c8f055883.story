For the first time in more than a decade, Army veteran Joseph Jones was able to recognize bits of his old face in the mirror following a eight-hour procedure to repair damage to his face sustained by a roadside bomb.

Over the course of the surgery, performed in South Miami, roughly 3,000 follicles were transplanted from to Jones' face, returning the beard and eyebrows he had before the explosion that burned them away while serving in the Iraq war. 

Jones was the beneficiary of Faces of Honor program, an initiative from 
the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to 
help Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.

Dr. Jeffrey Epstein marks Army vet Joseph Jones on the areas he plans to transplant new hair follicles where Jones was injured in combat

The follicles on Jones' face were killed by a roadside blast while serving in Iraq in 2004

Jones, 35, of Youngstown, Fla., told The Miami Herald that he felt as if the injury that robbed him of his hair permanently altered his identity.

'After the IED blast, my hair would not grow on my face. I don’t 
have eyebrows, eyelashes or a beard. I looked odd and sometimes people 
would stare at me,' Jones said. 'I feel like I lost a part of 
my identity when I lost my hair.'

The procedure was performed by MIami-Dade surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Epstein.

Without the Faces of Honor program, the procedure would normally cost about $16,000.

'We are trying to 
make these veterans look whole. There is a difference between healed and
 whole,' Dr. Charlie Finn, the humanitarian chair of the plastic 
surgery academy, told The Miami Herald.

Only a few procedures have been done for the program so far, generally focusing on burns or scars.

The little-known program relies on surgeons donating their services.

Veterans must have a combat injury from Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and an honorable discharge to qualify.

Epstein says the procedures can be an important step in psychological recovery.

'The
 facial hair loss for Jones raises the memories of what was a trauma,' he said. 'The beard and facial hair 
will put him in harmony with how he feels. It’s going to make a 
difference.'

The back third of Jones' hair was shaved for the procedure to be used as donor hair.

Epstein also used blue marker to outline eyebrows and a beard on his patient's face.

They injected Jones with a local anesthetic where the grafts would be harvested.

Epstein then used a microscopic drill to make micro-punches for donor tissue.

Epstein said has performed more than 9,000 of these procedures.

Jones told reporters he wanted to follow the family tradition of service (his grandfather, father, and uncle were all in the Army) since he was a young boy.

As a child, he sat in rapt attention watching movies like Top Gun and Iron Eagle.

'When I saw those movies, I knew that was my course in life,' he said. 'I knew I wanted to serve my country.'

He finally got his wish, deploying to Iraq in 2004.

In March of that year, he and four other soldiers were the victims of a roadside bomb when their Humvee triggered a blast on a trip to deliver food.

The hair follicles on Jones' face were deadened and his skin pigment damaged, though no one was seriously injured.

'It
 was almost like a grease fire like you see in the kitchen, but it took 
off my eyebrows and eyelashes,' eh said. 'When I was receiving treatment, the 
doctors told me everything would grow back. But it never did. I can grow a goatee, but only because it was covered during the blast 
by my chinstrap.'

He was injured again eight months later in a second roadside explosion that damaged his left knee and right ankle, and sent him back to the U.S. with a limp.

He says he's since had trouble finding a steady job because he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder.

Some have even joked that his appearance leaves him looking like 'Powder,' the hairless albino character from a 1995 film.

He discovered the Faces of Honor program earlier this year, and was evaluated by Epstein in August.

'The hair is a way for me to feel better about yourself,' Jones said.

At the end of the procedure, Jones said the resulting grafts looked like stubble from a five o'clock shadow, and were sensitive to touch.

After two weeks those hairs will fall out, then four months later new hairs should regenerate.

'Some people might look at me and say I don’t need hair,' Jones said. 'But this is important to me. I want to look normal.'
