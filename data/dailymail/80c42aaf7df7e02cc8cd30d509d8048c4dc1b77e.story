While dozens of firms have launched wearable computer of sifferent shapes and sizes, one problem remains - they all look like computers.

A Finnish firm hopes to change that with the Ibis, a 'smart bracelet' that is the firm wearable aimed at women.

The smartwatch is designed to be 'wearable jewellery' and is made using stainless steel and crystal.

The Ibis watch is the first to target women, using a design inspired by nature.

The firm says the design was inspired by a flying bird whose wing tips touch together while carrying a young bird on its back, symbolising the precious and personal current of information on your smart watch.

'We believe the demand for smart watches will be driven by fashion and sport brands, and the Ibis exemplifies the type of product that we create for fashion brands,' said Creoir Ltd CEO Pekka VÃ¤yrynen.

'Every brand has its own design language, so with each client we start from scratch to develop a product that specifically matches the brand and their audience.

'With our expertise, we can provide consumer brand owners with everything they need to have a real advantage when entering the smart device space.'

According to industry research company Gartner, most smart watches have not achieved mass-market appeal due to the lack of innovative design.

'Samsung and other well-known vendors have recently entered the smart watch space, yet the products we have seen so far have been rather uninspiring in terms of design, available apps and features," said Annette Zimmermann, principal research analyst at Gartner. 

She believes that mass market smartwatches are still a few years away.

'As a result, Gartner predicts that wearable devices will remain a companion to mobile phones at least through 2017, with less than one percent of premium phone users opting to replace their phone with a combination of a wearable device and a tablet.'

The majority of products that have been launched so far have displays that many consumers will find 'unstylish & clunky' due to their bulkiness.

The Ibis makers says the design was inspired by a flying bird whose wing tips touch together while carrying a young bird on its back, symbolising the precious and personal current of information on your smart watch.

The bracelet runs a modified version of Google's Android software, and works with both Android and iOS handsets.

The firm hopes to attract a younger, female audience compared to rival from Pebble and sports manufacturers.

'Any watch, smart or not, is personal style statement by the wearer.

'The Ibis brings an innovative design-led approach to the nascent smart watch industry where fashion will be a key driver of smart watch sales for consumers'
