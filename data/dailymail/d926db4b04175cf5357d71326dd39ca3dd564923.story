He is widely acclaimed as being one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century, but little has been known about his own personal choice of literature - until now.

A list containing 22 books that F Scott Fitzgerald thought were essential reading has just come to light, which the author of The Great Gatsby dictated to his nurse while convalescing in a North Carolina hotel in 1936.

The hard-drinking Fitzgerald was battling alcoholism, and struggling financially.

It was a dark time for the 40-year-old.

Esquire had recently published his essay The Crack Up, in which he stated 'my life had been a drawing on resources
 that I did not possess, that I had been mortgaging myself physically 
and spiritually up to the hilt.'

That summer he had fractured his shoulder 
while diving into the hotel swimming pool.

According to Michael Cody, at the University of South Carolina's Fitzgerald's website, he had also fired a revolver in a suicide threat.

It was after this incident that the hotel where he was staying in Asheville, the Grove Park Inn, refused to let him continue living there unless he had a nurse to look after him.

Mr Cody states: 'He was attended thereafter by Dorothy Richardson, whose chief duties were to provide him company and try to keep him from drinking too much.

'In typical Fitzgerald fashion, he developed a friendship with Miss Richardson and attempted to educate her by providing her with a reading list.'

According to website Open Culture, which published the list, at the top of the page, Richardson had written: 'These are books that Scott thought should be required reading.'
