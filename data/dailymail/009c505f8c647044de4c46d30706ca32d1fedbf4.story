An 89-year-old war veteran was forced to wait on a hospital trolley in A&E for 34 hours, before a bed could be found for him, it has emerged. 

David Walters had become delirious after developing a temperature.

His concerned family called for an ambulance, and five hours later Mr Walters was taken into A&E at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales.

But he stayed on a trolley waiting for a bed at the scandal-hit hospital for another 34 hours.

Second World War veteran David Walters was forced to wait for 34 hours on a trolley in A&E before he could be admitted on to a ward when a bed became free at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend

Mr Walters' plight is just one example of the experience of thousands of patients across the UK who are subjected to long waits at A&E departments.

His story comes as it emerged just 90.2 per cent of patients in England were seen within four hours between October and December last year - short of the 95 per cent target.

It marks the worst performance in A&E since the target was set in 2004. 

Meanwhile in Wales, where the Labour party runs the NHS, 81 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E between arrival until admission, transfer or discharge, in November last year.

And the ex-Royal Navy seaman's ordeal came just weeks after he was honoured by Russia, and awarded the Ushakov medal, for his bravery on the deadly Arctic convoys during the Second World War.

His granddaughter Jodie Rowlands said: 'He wasn't able to recognise his family or friends. 

'It was only after an old friend, who is a retired doctor, saw him and said he needed to go to hospital that anything happened.

'He had to wait for 34 hours in A&E. 

'He was taken inside the first two hours to be assessed, but he was then taken back out to the ambulance.  

'He was 34 hours on a trolley, and he received no tests or treatment, other than being given some paracetamol.' 

Mr Walters's family called an ambulance after the 89-year-old became delirious after developing a temperature

The Princess of Wales Hospital is at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect.

A spokesman for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'We offer our apologies as this is not the standard of care we would wish to provide by keeping patients in the emergency department for this length of time.

'However the hospital was under extreme pressure and there were delays in patients being transferred to appropriate wards in a timely way.

'This situation was not unique to this hospital - many others across the UK have been under similar pressure.'  

Louise Platt, the Welsh Ambulance Service's head of operations for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area, added: 'Demand on our ambulance service was higher than anticipated on Wednesday evening and this, coupled with delays at hospitals across the region meant we were unable to respond to some calls in the time we would have liked.

'Unfortunately, the call to Mr Walters was one of those calls, but we maintained contact with staff to ensure he remained stable.

'If a relative of Mr Walters would like to discuss this further, we would invite them to contact the trust. In the meantime, our thoughts and well wishes are with him and his family.'
