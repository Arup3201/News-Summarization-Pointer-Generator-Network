This is the moment a group of pall-bearers dropped a corpse to the ground - but carried on oblivious to their mishap. 

In the footage from a funeral procession in Indonesia, the pall-bearers hurriedly walk past a group of onlookers on the side of the road.

But, unbeknown to them, the corpse falls out of the coffin and lands with a thump on the tarmac. 

The six pall-bearers enter the scene carrying the coffin during the funeral procession in Indonesia 

Without realising, the corpse falls to the road, as the pall-bearers walk on unaware of any problem 

The pall-bearers march on as the corpse (far right) lies unattended in the middle of the road 

An agitated spectator beckons the pall-bearers to turn around and retrieve the corpse from the ground

Two people shout to the pall-bearers to come back and pick up the corpse lying on the tarmac

Realising their blunder, the pall-bearers rush to retrieve the corpse and put it back in to the coffin

Rather than stop to retrieve the corpse, the bungling pall-bearers continue to march down the street blissfully unaware of their blunder. 

It is only when they are alerted by a couple of animated spectators that they turn around to pick up the fallen corpse. 

They then hastily place it back in the container before going on with the funeral procession. 

Indonesia is known for digging up the bodies of their dead relatives before washing, grooming and dressing them in fancy new clothes, in some parts of the country.

Families in Toraja in South Sulawesi fix damaged coffins and the mummies are then walked around the province by following a path of straight lines.  

The ritual is called Ma'nene, or The Ceremony of Cleaning Corpses.
