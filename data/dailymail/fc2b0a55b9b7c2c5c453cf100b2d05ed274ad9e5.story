Air passengers have been warned they could be held on planes for up to 12 hours and face mass flight cancellations due to next week’s public sector strikes.

BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, has told airlines to fly planes half full to help ease the chaos expected when immigration officers walk out.

The warning comes as union bosses said they have amassed a fighting fund of tens of millions of pounds to bring the country to its knees with months of strikes – beginning on Wednesday.

Unrest: The public sector pensions strike next week could go on for months, leaving the country in chaos

Travel hell: Air passengers can expect severe delays from next week with Heathrow airport advising airlines to fly planes half full in a bid to ease congestion at airport arrivals

Earlier this week, the Government said that civil servants and other inexperienced workers would be used to man the country's ports and airports when immigration staff walk out.

Labour MP Keith Vaz warned that the last-minute drafting in of untrained staff at border control points was 'not a rigorous contingency plan'.

Heathrow’s operating 
officer Normand Boivin added: ‘There are likely to be very long delays of up to 12 
hours to arriving passengers.

'The delays at immigration are likely to 
be so long that passengers could not be safely accommodated within the 
terminals and would need to be held on arriving aircraft.

‘This in turn would quickly create 
gridlock at the airport with no available aircraft parking stands, mass 
cancellations or departing aircraft and diversions outside the UK for 
arriving aircraft.’

The rolling programme of public sector strikes will begin with 
Wednesday’s walkout, set to be the biggest since the General Strike of 
1926. But union barons said it was fantasy to think it would be a 
one-off.

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, said the strikes would continue into 2012 in the bitter dispute over pensions.

Despairing: Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said the last thing the economy needed was a 'self-inflicted wound'

‘It is Alice in Wonderland stuff to think that 30 November will happen, 
people will stop work, take part in rallies, go home and say: “That was 
all right. Now we can give in”. It is just nonsense.’

The GMB has a war chest of ‘tens of millions of pounds’, he said, which 
can be used to help individual strikers or smaller unions. He expects 
1.5million to two million public sector workers to walk out on 
Wednesday.

The list includes teachers, nurses, paramedics, bin men, top civil servants, lollipop ladies and tax inspectors.

Most schools will be closed, operations will be cancelled and the elderly may go unfed in hospitals.

Mr Kenny said: ‘The overwhelming number of people will not get their bins emptied on Wednesday.’

In an unexpected perk, he said many motorists will be able to park for 
free because GMB members include traffic wardens and operators of 
municipal car parks.

Unison, the country’s biggest health union, warned last night the Health Service will run only a ‘Christmas Day type’ rota.

Of 1.56million NHS staff, around 450,000 are members of Unison, doing a 
variety of jobs from paramedics to nurses, hospital porters to 
healthcare assistants.

It is feared that more than £500million in output will be lost and jobs 
could be axed at a time when unemployment is at a 17-year high of 
2.6million.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said
during a visit to Leeds today: 'Clearly we're going to do everything we
can - notwithstanding the terrible disruption and, frankly, cost to the
economy these strikes will create - to make sure that systems, 
including our borders are properly policed and properly controlled.

'But my message to the trade union 
bosses who are corralling their members into conflict is: let the 
teachers and the nurses and the doctors, and so on, let everybody take a
bit of time to look at the information that we've provided on our 
Government website so people can look for themselves at what we're 
offering.

'Actually what we're offering is reasonable and generous.

'We're saying all your pension 
entitlements you've got until now will be protected; if you're going to 
retire within 10 years there will be no change; if you're on a low or 
middle income your pension will be the same, if not better than it was 
before.

'I think the trade union bosses are 
really doing a disservice - obviously to the public - but also to their 
own members by not allowing their members to make up their own minds 
based on the information that we're providing in our reasonable offer 
from the Government.'

Twenty-nine unions are taking part in Wednesday’s walkout following a 
ballot of 2.6million members. As few as 800,000 voted for action and 
turnout for Unison was only 29 per cent.

Only the Association of 
Professional Ambulance Personnel, with 1,240 NHS paramedics, voted 
against strikes. 
Ian Boothman, the ballot organiser, said: ‘It reflects both the 
dedication of our members and the difficulties they have with the 
concept of withdrawing the 999 service from the public.’

Ministers said it was wrong to strike over pensions that were much more 
generous than those in the private sector. The public sector pensions 
bill is around £32billion a year, with workers contributing £5.5billion a
year and the rest paid by the taxpayer.

The Government wants public workers to pay more into their pension, get a lower payout and retire at a later age. But earlier this month, ministers made a major concession to protect those within ten years of retirement.

Workers who walk out on Wednesday will not be paid, unless they are in particular hardship.

On the Heathrow disruption, the UKBA said: ‘The security of the UK 
border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore 
all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union
action.’

Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude has warned that the mass walkout may prompt radical changes to strike laws. ‘If strikes are called on the basis 
of these very low turnouts then [the people who are calling for change] 
will feel their case is strengthened,’ he said.

Katja Hall, from the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘What’s 
particularly disappointing is that some of the largest unions have not 
managed to achieve a clear mandate for a strike, and schools may be 
forced to close despite only a handful of teachers voting for it.’

A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'We are very concerned about the effect next week's strike will have on passengers and airport operators. Britain cannot afford to be closed for business.

'To reduce the number of passengers coming into UK airports and to minimise disruption to our passengers, we will allow those booked on inbound travel on November 30 to rebook for travel up to four days earlier or later without charge.

'Along with airport operators, other airlines and the wider aviation industry, we are continuing discussions with the Government and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) about possible contingencies.'

British Airways said: 'We are concerned that the UKBA strike on November 30 creates considerable uncertainty for our customers booked to fly into UK airports on that day.

'We understand that there will be a significant risk of severe delays in passing through passport control, with potential knock-on effects on wider airport operations.

'We are doing everything that we can to protect our customers and continue to liaise closely with Government, UKBA and airport authorities about possible contingencies.'
