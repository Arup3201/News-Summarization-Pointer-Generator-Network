Britain’s economic recovery has ‘finally taken hold’, Bank of England chief Mark Carney declared today.

The upbeat Governor declared that now ‘the glass is half full’ for the economy, after another slew of positive jobs and growth figures.

But as unemployment fell to its lowest rate for four and a half years, there was a warning that interest rates could now rise as early as 2014.

Cheers: In an upbeat assessment of Britain's economy, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the recovery had taken hold and growing faster than most other countries

The Bank of England now predicts growth this year of 1.6 per cent, up from its earlier forecast of 1.4 per cent.

New figures show 7.6 per cent of people were out of work in the three months to September, a level not seen since early 2009.

The Bank of England has set a target of unemployment reaching 7 per cent before it will put up interest rates.

Bank of England's Mark Carney

It had been expected by the end of 2016 but the Bank's quarterly inflation report says there is now a two-in-five chance of rates rising by the end of 2014.

Mr Carney said today: 'Inflation is now as low as it has been since 2009. Jobs are being created at a rate of 60,000 per month. The economy is growing at its fastest pace in 6 years.

'For the first time in a long time, you don’t have to be an optimist to see the glass as half full. The recovery has finally taken hold.'

The number of people in work has also 
reached a record high of 29.95million, while the number claiming 
Jobseekers Allowance saw its biggest fall since 1998.

However Mr Carney warned 1million more
people are still out of work than before the financial crash and many 
people in part-time jobs would like full-time work.

Wages are still being outstripped by inflation and the economy remains 2.5 per cent smaller than it was in 2008, he added.

So far the recovery has been driven by increased consumer spending and housing, with export demand still lagging.

'With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it. We will continue the process of repairing the financial sector.

Is Britain's economy back on track?

'And
we will continue to provide exceptional monetary stimulus so that 
British households and businesses have, for the first time in a long 
time, the confidence not just that the glass is half full, but that it will be filled.'

Mr Carney stressed that hitting the 7 per cent target for unemployment would not trigger an automatic rise in interest rates.

However, later Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg signalled that as the economy the historically low rates of 0.5 per cent would come to an end.

Speaking at a Tesco store in West London, Mr Clegg said: 'I really don't think it helps for me to start trying to second guess how interest rates may or may not be set in the future.

'All I would say is that interest rates are at an unprecedentedly low level because of the unprecedented economic challenges the country has faced.

'We are going through abnormal times and so interest rates have been set at very unusually low levels.

'At some point we hope normal life will be resumed in all senses of the word.'

Boast: David Cameron took to Twitter to express his delight at the good jobs nfigures

More than 18 per cent of people working part-time would like a full-time job, new figures show.

The number of part-time workers stood at 7.89 million in July-September, of which 1.457million said they could not find full-time work - the highest figure since records began in 1992.

The number of men in part-time employment increased by 41,000 to reach 2.15 million while the number for women fell by 22,000 to 5.94 million.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: 'It is welcome that the economy is growing again, but a return to growth is not yet a return to normality.

'Nearly one million more people are out of work than in the years before the financial crisis.

'Many others in part time work would prefer to be working full time.'

The number of people on the dole has fallen dramatically, down by 41,700 to reach 1.31 million in October.

Since October last year the number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance has fallen by 266,500, the largest annual fall since May 1998.

David Cameron hailed the figures as evidence that the coalition’s economic strategy is paying dividends.

‘There are now 1.1m more people in work since the election - more proof our long-term plan for Britain is working,’ he wrote on Twitter.

However, 1.46 million people are working part-time because they could not find a full-time job, an increase of 24,000 over the quarter, and the highest figure since records began in 1992.

Almost a third of working men are in 
part-time employment because they cannot find a full-time job, compared 
to 13 per cent of women.

Chancellor George Osborne struck a cautious note last night, telling the Telegraph Festival of Business: 'I think we are on the path for prosperity, I think we have got the fundamentals right. We have got an economic plan which is delivering what very many countries in the world would crave, which is certainty, stability and competitiveness.

'It is making this country a much more competitive place to do business. But we have to deliver that plan and there is still a lot to be done. There is a huge amount to be done to reduce the deficit.'

Year-on-year price rises continue to outstrip pay increases, new figures show

Pressures on family finances continues, with pay rising by just 0.7 per cent, compared to the 2.2 per cent rise in living costs as tracked by the Consumer Prices Index.

The Bank of England said inflation is on course to fall back to around its 2 per cent target 'over the next year or so' after figures yesterday showed it fell to 2.2 per cent in October, a 13-month low.

The gap between pay in the public and private sector has narrowed. In September 2013 average pay in the private sector was £473 a week, £14 a week lower than the public sector figure of £487 a week.

Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ‘Today’s fall in unemployment is welcome, but families facing a cost-of-living crisis need a recovery that benefits them, and these figures show we are still far from achieving that.’

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Britain's workforce is getting larger but poorer.

'It is encouraging that more jobs are being created but job quality is falling and close to a 20-year low. A record number of people are stuck in part-time jobs because they can't find full-time work, while real wages continue to shrink fast despite falling inflation.

'We need better jobs and healthier pay rises to tackle the living standards crisis and ensure that the full benefits of recovery reach working people.'
