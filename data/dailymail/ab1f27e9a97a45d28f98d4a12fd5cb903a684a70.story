A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that wife Mary gave birth to their fourth child.

Kennedy used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a mark out of ten.

The list contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside them - which is believed to have signified that they had full intercourse.

Alongside more prosaic details of Kennedy’s political activism and family life, there are startling admissions of his own feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife.

Time and again he writes of how he feels tortured by his ‘lust demons’ as he describes them.

On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation.

‘I’m like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on Nov. 5, 2001.

The thick, red journal was found at one stage by his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who, distraught over their impending divorce and her husband's serial philandering, hanged herself in May 2012.

The diary has since found its way into the hands of the New York Post.

When a Post reporter questioned Kennedy on Friday about the diary they were first met with a stunned silence before he denied having kept a diary during that year.

‘I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001,’ said Kennedy. ‘I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.’

At the start of the journal the 59-year-old son of the assassinated U.S. senator announces that his wife was pregnant with their fourth child.

But soon Kennedy was writing about far seedier matters. He often writes as if he is the victim of the incidents and uses the word ‘mugged’ as shorthand for being seduced.

‘I narrowly escaped being mugged by a double team of [two women]. It was tempting but I prayed and God gave me the strength to say no,’ he writes on February 6.

On May 21, he wrote that after hosting dinner for Leonardo DiCaprio, he drove the actor into Manhattan and met up with someone. He noted that he ‘got mugged on my way home,’ recording a 10 with the name of a woman next to it.

‘I’ve got to do better,’ he adds.

In another entry, he said he needed to ‘avoid the company of women. You have not the strength to resist their charms’ and to ‘be humble like a monk. Keep your hands to yourself. Avert your eyes.’

Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail in July after getting arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia, the United States Navy training facility on the island of Vieques.

He writes positively about his incarceration because it temporarily freed him from the desires of his raging libido.

‘I’m so content here,’ he writes. ‘I have to say it. There’s no women. I’m happy! Everybody here seems happy. It’s not misogyny. It’s the opposite! I love them too much.’

On July 8, just days before son Aiden was born, he writes lovingly about his wife: ‘I finally spoke to my wonderful wife and that was a joy. She is very strong and cheerful.’

‘I’m so proud of my Mary. She has become the woman I fell in love with - through hard work. She has overcome her fears, enshrined her faith, abandoned self-pity and blame and immersed herself in gratitude and God gave her a baby... a beautiful and serene and happy soul.

'I am so happy. I couldn’t be happier or more grateful for the life and the wife God has given me.’

He also found time to contemplate his own weaknesses and his feelings of insecurity in trying to live up the legacy of his father.

‘After daddy died I struggled to be a grown-up... I felt he was watching me from heaven. Every time I was afflicted with sexual thoughts, I felt a failure. I hated myself. I began to lie - to make up a character who was the hero and leader that I wished I was,’ he writes on July 25.

Near the end of his jail sentence he writes of a ‘three-point plan’ for ‘fixing my greatest defect... my lust demons’ - but he never writes with the plan is.

By mid-August, he is out of jail and once again women’s names appear in the back of his journal.

‘I have been given everything that I coveted - a beautiful wife and kids and loving family, wealth, education, good health and a job I love yet always on the lookout for something I can’t have. I want it all,’ he writes.

‘No matter how much I have - I want more.’

November 2001 was an especially busy month for infidelities and he lists at least one woman’s name on 22 different dates, including on 13
consecutive days.

Three dalliances even occur on the same day - one is marked a ten - when he attended a black-tie fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria on Nov. 13 for Christopher Reeve’s charity.
