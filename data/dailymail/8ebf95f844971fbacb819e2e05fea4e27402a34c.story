An 85-year-old U.S. tourist detained in North Korea for six weeks for alleged 'war crimes' has landed back in San Francisco after catching a flight from Beijing.

North Korean state media said Saturday that Merrill Newman, a war veteran, was released because he had apologized for his alleged crimes during the Korean War and because of his age and medical condition.

Speaking after arriving at San Francisco International Airport, Mr Newman said he was glad to be back home and thanked U.S. and Swedish diplomats who worked to secure his release.

'I'd like to thank the Swedish EmbassyÂ  and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. It was a great homecoming! I'm tired, pleased to be with my family. Thank you for all the support we've had.'

Beaming:  Merrill Newman walked past a cavalcade of reporters. He said it felt good to be back home and was looking forward to seeing his family and getting some rest

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who is
 traveling in Seoul, welcomed the release and said he talked by phone 
with Newman in Beijing, offering him a ride home on Air Force Two. Biden
 said Newman declined because of a direct flight to his home state of 
California, which he took later Saturday.

Newman's
 son, Jeffrey, said he spoke briefly with his father from Beijing and 
that he was 'in excellent spirits and eager to be reunited with his 
family.'

'As you can 
imagine this has been a very difficult ordeal for us as a family, and 
particularly for him,' he said in a statement read outside his home in 
Pasadena, adding that they will say more about this unusual journey 
after Newman has rested.

Last
 month, Newman read from an awkwardly worded alleged confession that 
apologized for, among other things, killing North Koreans during the 
war. They were his first words since being taken off a plane October 26 by 
North Korean authorities while preparing to leave the country after a 
10-day tour. Analysts questioned whether the statement was coerced, and 
former South Korean guerrillas who had worked with Newman and fought 
behind enemy lines during the war disputed some of the details.

Newman's
 detention highlights the extreme sensitivity with which Pyongyang views
 the 1950-53 war, which ended without a formal peace treaty, leaving the
 Korean Peninsula sill technically in a state of war. The conflict is a 
regular focus of North Korean propaganda and media, which accuse 
Pyongyang's wartime enemies Washington and Seoul of carrying on the 
fighting by continuing to push for the North's overthrow.

Propaganda reel: Newman reading a written apology for his alleged crimes both as a tourist and during his participation in the Korean War, while under detention

'In
 the United States, we revealingly refer to the Korean War as the 
`forgotten war.' Most Americans do not realize that memory of the war's 
violence is at the foundation of North Korean national identity,' said 
Christine Hong, an Asia specialist at the University of California at 
Santa Cruz who has twice visited North Korea.

Tension
 remains on the Korean Peninsula, though Pyongyang's angry rhetoric 
against the U.S. and South Korea has toned down compared with its 
torrent of springtime threats to launch nuclear strikes and restart 
nuclear bomb fuel production.

State
 Department spokeswoman Marie Harf urged Pyongyang to pardon 'as a 
humanitarian gesture' another American, Kenneth Bae, who has been held 
in the North for more than a year.

Members
 of the former South Korean guerrilla group said in an interview last 
week with The Associated Press that Newman was their adviser. Some have 
expressed surprise that Newman would take the risk of visiting North 
Korea given his association with their group, which is still remembered 
with keen hatred in the North. Others were amazed Pyongyang still 
considered Newman a threat.

'Why
 did North Korea make such a big fuss?' Park Chan-wu, a former guerrilla
 who worked with Newman during the war, said Saturday. 'It's been 60 
years since he worked as our adviser.'

The
 televised statement read last month by Newman said he was attempting to
 meet surviving guerrilla fighters he had trained during the conflict so
 he could reconnect them with their wartime colleagues living in South 
Korea, and that he had criticized the North during his recent trip.

Newman's
 political value had 'expired' for North Korea, said Chang Yong Seok, a 
senior researcher at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and
 Unification Studies. Newman's written apology and the TV broadcast were
 enough for Pyongyang to show outsiders that it has maintained its 
dignity - something the proud country views as paramount, said Chang.

There was relief in Newman's home state of California.

'He's
 a genuine and generous man, and we're all so relieved that he's coming 
home,' said Dan Haifley, executive director of O'Neill Sea Odyssey, an 
ocean exploration program in Santa Cruz that the Newmans have supported.

Jeffrey
 Newman has previously said that his father, an avid traveler and 
retired finance executive from California, had always wanted to return 
to the country where he fought during the Korean War.

Before
 Newman, North Korea detained at least six Americans since 2009. Five of
 them have been either released or deported after prominent Americans 
like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter travelled to 
Pyongyang.

'The release
 is vintage North Korea,' Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum 
CSIS think tank in Hawaii, said of Newman. 'They always try to capture 
the attention away from something that might make (South Korea) look 
good and get the spotlight on them instead. Normally they do this by 
doing something negative. At least in this instance, it was a positive 
gesture.'
