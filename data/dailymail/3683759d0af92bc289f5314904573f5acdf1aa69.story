Lord Hill has been criticised after taking severance pay before landing a highly-paid position 

The ex-Tory cabinet minister named as Britain’s new man in Brussels has been accused of ‘pure greed’ – for taking a £25,000 ministerial pay-off ahead of a huge pay rise for his new job.

Lord Hill of Oareford was last week formally nominated as European Commissioner for Financial Services on an expected annual salary of almost £200,000 – double the pay of his previous job in David Cameron’s Cabinet.

But Government insiders have confirmed that the Tory peer – a friend of the Prime Minister – had also taken £25,260 in ‘severance pay’ when he stood down as Leader of the House of Lords in July.

And last night, Labour MP John Mann branded it ‘pure greed’ and challenged Lord Hill, whose job will include ensuring the EU’s financial stability, to repay the money.

Mr Mann said: ‘This pay-off is totally unjustifiable, especially given the scale of his new salary in Brussels and all the perks attached to it. 

'Lord Hill is certainly looking after his own financial stability – at the expense of the British taxpayer.

‘Whether he is technically entitled to this money or not, I think he should pay it all back.’

Former lobbyist Lord Hill, 54, was a surprise choice to be the UK’s new European Commissioner in July as just three weeks earlier he had insisted he did not want the job and preferred to live in Britain.

There were also concerns that he was not a big enough figure to guarantee the UK a major portfolio in Brussels amid reports that Jean-Claude Juncker, the new European Commission president, resorted to Google to find out who he was.

Two years ago, there were claims that Lord Hill had actually tried to resign as an education minister, only for Mr Cameron not to realise that he was trying to quit and tell him to carry on with his good work.

But last week, Mr Juncker nominated him for the coveted financial services brief on the Commission – potentially a key role in preventing Brussels from imposing damaging new rules on the City of London. 

The job, to be confirmed later this autumn, comes with a salary of just under £200,000 – almost twice his Lords’ Leader salary of £101,000.

As a new commissioner, he will also be entitled to an ‘installation allowance’ of £33,000, plus reimbursements of his moving expenses and travel costs to Brussels.

Last night, a spokesman for Lord Hill defended the pay-off, pointing out that until he was confirmed as European Commissioner, he was not receiving a salary.

The spokesman said: ‘Like all Ministers who leave the Government, Lord Hill received three months’ severance pay in mid-July. He has not received any salary since then.He will only receive a European Commission salary once the new Commission is formed. This is not expected to be until November 1, at the earliest.’

Since his nomination, Lord Hill – a former political secretary to Prime Minister John Major – has announced he would sell his shares in public relations firm Huntsworth to avoid a potential conflict of interest.

The firm represents some of Europe’s biggest companies and also does media work for the European Commission.
