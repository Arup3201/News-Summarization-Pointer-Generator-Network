It seems Paddington Bear has finally got sick of marmalade - and developed a taste for blood.

A CGI version of the classic children's character, due to star in a blockbuster film this November, has prompted online hilarity after he was dubbed 'creepy' by film fans.

And despite being voiced by the softly-spoken British actor Ben Whishaw, the bear from darkest Peru now appears to be starring in horror classics The Shining, Jacob's Ladder and Friday the 13th.
