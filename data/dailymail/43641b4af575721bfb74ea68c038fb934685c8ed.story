The heartbreaking wills of soldiers who fell on the Western Front have been revealed for the first time, 100 years after they were written. 

The documents, some penned by boys as young as 14, offer a rare glimpse into what life was like for many of the soldiers before war began on July 28, 1914. 

Among them are emotional farewells from teenagers to their mothers and romantic pledges from husbands and lovers leaving their possessions to the women they left at home. 

The last testaments of soldiers on the Western Front have been revealed to commemorate the centenary of the First World War 

Each member of the British and Commonwealth Army was required to compose a will following the outbreak of war. 

Kept in their pocketbooks, many of the surviving documents bear signs of the battlefield be it bullet-holes or dust. 

One letter, written by a Private Horace Henry Cook who died in the first battle of Ypres on November 1, 1914, reveals his love for a girlfriend he would never be able to make his wife. 

Writing of Beatrice Brown from Westham, London, he instructed: 'She is to be treated in all possible respects as my wife, which would have been the case.' 

Another soldier's final letter to his mother describes the torrid conditions endured by servicemen at the beginning of the First World War. 

'We have to fight like tigers to get our food here.

'This war is going to be worse than I thought. Some seem to think it won't last a month and some say it will last three years. 

'If I never come home again I leave the boy in your charge and I know you will do your best to him. 

'I have got to make my will this afternoon. I shall make it out to you everything of what I possess. So if I go under and you do not get anything you must apply for it. 

Among the letters and wills are those from young men to their mothers to whom they leave all their possessions

The letters are among millions of records which have been made public to commemorate the war 

One of the letters was written by a young man who  died in the Battle of Ypres (depicted) on November 1 1914 

'If I get killed in Active Service, there will be a medal for me somewhere and I hope you will try and get it and keep it for the boy to wear when he grows up. 

'We carry a little book with us to enter all payments and made to us and it has got a poem of will in it.' 

Courts Minister Helen Grant said: ‘This fascinating project has opened the door to a whole new insight on our war heroes – it has given us the opportunity for the first time to hear the thoughts and emotions of the brave soldiers who died for this country in their own words.

‘It is a great example of the innovation going on throughout Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service to provide a modern and efficient service to the public.’
