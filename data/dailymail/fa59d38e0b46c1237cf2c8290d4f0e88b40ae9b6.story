An eagle-eyed photographer has created a stunning montage showing the a time lapse of the moment a bird of prey swooped in on its dinner.

Photographer Christian Kneidinger spent nine hours in a bush in Scotland waiting to capture the eagle as it flew by in a split-second to grab a fish from the water.

The Austrian nature photographer said he used up all his patience to get the right shot - which paid off when he snapped the moment the bird went fishing.

Patient: Christian Kneidinger, who waited nine hours to capture this eagle as it grabbed his prey, combined three shots to create this montage

He said: 'I was deep under the long grass, by the side of the lake. 

'It's important the eagle does not see me, or he might not fly so close.

'I waited a very long time to get the perfect shot, it's a good job because I was getting hungry as well.'

To create the montage, Mr Kneidinger combined three shots, taken with a Canon EOS 5D Mark III, to show the eagle's swift movements as it descended on the water, grabbed the fish, then flew off. 

Hungry: The photographer said he waited a long time to get the perfect shot of the eagle, pictured as it it swoops down close to the water

Ready: With lightning speed, the bird of prey's wings fold in as it nears the lake and claws are ready to pounce on an unsuspecting fish

Splash: With the fish firmly clasped in its claws, the eagle flies off with its dinner - split-seconds after it swooped down
