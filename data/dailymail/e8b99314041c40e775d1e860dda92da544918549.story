A student was left paralysed after he was stung by a sea urchin while on holiday in Greece.

Callum Hall, 20, trod on the creature after jumping off a boat into the sea off the island of Skiathos.

The trainee PE teacher said: ‘It felt like a bee sting. I pulled three black spines out of my toe and thought no more of it.’

Callum Hall, with girlfriend Ailish Wilkinson, became paralysed after stepping on a sea urchin while on holiday in Greece last summer

He then developed a rare and deadly infection and an abscess twice the size of a tennis ball grew on his spine. When it burst, he needed life-saving surgery and was left without movement from the chest down

But three weeks later, back home in 
Leeds, he developed an agonising infection.

An abscess twice the size of
a tennis ball had grown on his spine and burst, damaging his spinal 
cord and leaving him paralysed from the chest down.

Mr Hall was told he had just hours to live and was given life-saving surgery at Leeds General Infirmary to remove the abscess.

Yesterday he said he was ‘incredibly 
lucky’ to be alive. He added: ‘There is only a one in 50,000 chance of 
an abscess like that on your spine and it’s almost unheard of for a sea 
urchin to cause it.’

He trod on the creature last summer and left 
hospital in a wheelchair last week. So far, he has regained some 
movement in his abdomen and can wiggle his toes.

He said: ‘I
have accepted the process is going to take time but I am determined to 
prove the doctors wrong who said I have a small chance of being able to 
walk again.'

Mr Hall hopes to raise thousands of pounds for the physiotherapy, equipment and care he will need if he is to walk again.

Unlucky: Callum jumped off a boat in Greece and was then stung by the sea urchin. There is only a one in 50,000 chance of it causing the abscess on the spine that paralysed him

Callum is determined to walk again and hopes to raise thousands of pounds for equipment to fight to walk again

He said: 'My aim is to raise as much money as 
possible for continuing physio, equipment and care.

'The reason for the 
urgency is that I am predicted up to a year and a half of recovery time from a spinal cord injury.

'There is still 
time and hope…but I will need financial help in order to get the right 
equipment, physio and resources I need to walk.'

The trainee PE teacher has vowed not to be defeated  - and now plans to take part in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Brazil.

He plans to achieve this by raising thousands of pounds for equipment for his battle 
to walk again.

He added: 'However to do this, I need equipment not found in hospitals and top of the range wheelchairs to use while training in and potentially being involved in Rio 2016 Paralympics.'

One piece of equipment he needs is called an 'Easy Stand', which helps him stand on his feet and aims to connect the brain back to the legs.

He also needs an FES (Functional Electrical Stimulation) bike which helps to get the leg muscles working again.

The determined student added: 'I realised that there are two things you can do.

'You can be depressed and you don’t get anywhere, or you can be focused and get on and do it.'

A puncture wound from a sea urchin (like the one pictured, right) can be painful and cause swelling and redness around the affected area.

If you 
have been stung by a sea urchin, and you have puncture wounds in several
places, you may experience more severe symptoms including: tiredness, weakness, aching muscles, shock, respiratory failure and paralysis.

The NHS says that in very rare cases, severe injuries from sea urchins have been known to cause death.

You should seek immediate medical attention if the symptoms include breathing problems, chest pain, signs of infection, such as increased redness and swelling in the affected area, and a high temperature of 38C or above.

Medical assistance is also required if there are spines in or near a joint, as they may need to be surgically removed.
