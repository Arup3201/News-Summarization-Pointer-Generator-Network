Leicester City have made a £7.5million bid for Burnley striker Danny Ings.

Manager Nigel Pearson is desperate for a new striker to help kickstart his side's slump to the foot of the Premier League where they are five points behind the Clarets.

They have been rebuffed in approaches for Andrej Kramaric of HNK Rijeka and Aleksandar Mitrovic from Anderlecht and could yet be rejected by Burnley over Ings. 

Danny Ings has scored four goals in 15 games so far this season for Burnley

Although the 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer, Burnley do not need to sell in January and have taken the view that finding his replacement would prove more expensive.

They do not want to put the club's financial position in jeopardy and believe Ings would prefer to weigh up his future in the summer when he is expected to have more offers to choose from.

Manager Sean Dyche this week said: 'The chairmen have come out and said he's going nowhere and I'm happy with that as a manager. We have open dialogue with him and his agent. 

Ings is a £7.5million target for the Foxes, who are also embroiled in a relegation scrap

'The club have made it quite clear how much they value the players we've got and we're in a good position cash-wise because we haven't spent a lot of money.'

Ings may yet ask to hear what Leicester have to offer but it will be down to Burnley to accept the fee. They will still be due compensation on Ings should he leave at the end of his contract.

Newcastle, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have also shown interest.
